So perhaps <b>a</b> motivation could be that, since we&#39;re looking for all the sums of the numbers in the set, products of numbers (with our set elements as exponents) would produce these sums. For the set {1,2,3,4,5}, the largest possible sum is 15 and the smallest is 0, so we could naively write out the terms x^0 + x^1 + ... + x^15. Then, perhaps, it&#39;s not such a stretch to ask ourselves what product of terms would create this list of polynomials. Namely, if we aren&#39;t concerned with the coefficients (because we just wrote down these polynomials as an exercise and their sum doesn&#39;t mean anything yet), we could try and determine the factors that produce a polynomial series with polynomials of power 0 to 15.

So I wondered why there should be SO much symmetry. <br><br>Then it hit me --- multiplication. Consider the 1 mod 5 sets (which I will call 1-sets) and the 2 mod 5 sets (which I will call 2-sets). If it were somehow possible to double every member of a 1 mod 5 set so that the total doubled, that could work, except that the process needs to be reversible to prove a 1-to-1 relationship between the 1-sets and the 2-sets. <br>I realised that this can work if we consider the numbers from 1 to 2000 as follows:<br>a) Leave multiples of 5 alone, as they contribute 0 to the remainder mod 5 anyway.<br>b) Rearrange numbers only within the interval between successive multiples of 5. For example to &#39;fake-double&#39; 11, we say it has remainder 1 mod 5 and within the 10-15 range we choose 12 as the number that has double its remainder mod 5. <br>So 11 gets replaced with 12, 12 by 14, 13 by 11 (double 3 = 6 = 1mod 5) and 14 replaced by 13 (4 * 2 = 8 = 3 mod 5). This is clearly reversible, because 3 is the multiplicative inverse of 2 mod 5 we effectively fake-treble the numbers to undo fake-doubling. <br>This DOES create a 1-to-1 correspondence between the 1-sets and 2-sets, guaranteeing total equality between the four non-zero remainders when considering how many subsets of {1...2000} total to those remainders.<br><br>For example, consider the 1-set S = {2,6,9,97,100,103,1004} which has total 1321 = 1 mod 5. To transform this into a 2-set we double the remainder of each member of the set mod 5, without moving any of the numbers past a multiple of 5. So 2 becomes 2*2 = 4. 6 becomes 7. 9 becomes 8 (remainder of 4 is doubled). 97 has remainder 2 so we need remainder 4 and 97 is mapped to 99. 100 is left alone (multiple of 5). 103 needs to have remainder 3*2 = 6 = 1 after moving, so it gets mapped to 101. Finally 1004 becomes 1003.<br>So the corresponding 2-set is {4,7,8,99,100,101,1003} with total 1322 = 2 mod 5. <br>We can transform each number back again unambiguously. <br><br>This symmetry argument shows that the total numbers of 1-sets, 2-sets, 3-sets and 4-sets must each equal (2^2000 - 2^400)/5", "comment_date": "2022-07-01T14:21:48Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Pedro Miguelez", "comment_text": "This would make a very cool Project Euler&#39;s problem!

I didn&#39;t read all the other comments to see if someone else brought it up, but here&#39;s how I worked it out :<br><br>I think of the subsets of {1,2,...,n} as blocks that I stack in columns. Each column is labeled 0, 1, 2, and so on. Those labels represent the possible sums of subsets. When a subset has a sum of 6, I place its block in the 6-labeled column and so on.<br>It&#39;s easy to see how to generate the subsets of {1,2,...,n} if you already know the subsets of {1,2,...,n-1} : take all the previous subsets, copy them and add the element &quot;n&quot; to each new copy. Consequently, the sums of those new copies of subsets are all the original sums +n, thus the copied blocks are to be shifted by &quot;n&quot; and then stacked on top of the original ones.<br>Now, if you think of the number of blocks in each labeled column as coefficients in front of powers of x (the k-th power is the k-th column), then everything comes around quite nicely. Assume you know the polynomial associated with {1,2,...,n-1} (let&#39;s call it p_{n-1}(x) ), then to generate the next polynomial, add p_{n-1} to a shifted version of p_{n-1} (to emulate what we did with the blocks). To shift all the coefficients, simply multiply the copy of p_{n-1} by x^n. Therefore, p_{n} = p_{n-1} + x^n \u2022 p_{n-1}. Factor p_{n-1} and you get : p_{n} = p_{n-1} \u2022 (1 + x^n).

Here is some more effort to generalize the problem exposed in this video. With the notations of my previous entry, let&#39;s write:<br><br>* M a positive integer which replaces the 5 used as example in the video<br>* N the maximum number of elements with the restriction m = mod(N, M) = 0 (\u21d4 \u2203 an integer k so that N = k.M)<br>* The problem consists in finding the number of subsets, which element&#39;s sum is divisible by M, CS(M, N = k.M)<br><br> The method demonstrated in the video can be applied to answer this generalized problem, but a few more details must be considered:<br>* Of course M-th roots of unity must be considered, let&#39;s call them Zeta(M, j) with j \u2208 {1 .. M}. Let&#39;s call CZ(M, j) the contribution of Zeta(M, j) to CS(M, N).<br>* The dominant contribution remains CZ(M, M) = 2^N/M from the trivial root of unity Zeta(M, M)  = 1.<br>* When M is an even number, then Zeta(M, M//2) = -1. This completely nullify the contribution of some roots of unity.<br>* When evaluating CZ(M, j), then GCD(M, j),  the Greatest Common Divisor of M and j must be considered. More specifically the magic which is explained @<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bOXCLR3Wric&amp;t=26m18s\">26:18</a> can be generalized:<br>CZ(M, j) = 2^(GCD(M, j).k)/M except when M is even and mod(M/2, GCD(M, j)) = 0 in which case CZ(M, j) = 0. <br><br>Condensed like that the formula looks complex and unnatural, having a precise look at what is going on here is very interesting!<br>* When M is even and when GCD(M, j) is a natural divisor of M/2 aka M/2 = p.GCD(M, j) p being a positive integer, then Zeta(M, i)^p is nothing but -1, the term (1+Zeta(M,i)^p) = 0 and thus CZ(M, j) = 0<br>* In the other cases, then the image of the various powers of Zeta(M, j) is a balanced subset of all roots of unity. Each one of the k repeated term of the generating function when evaluated for Z(M, j) is in fact the repetition of GCD(M, j) terms which value turns out to be 2.

Plugging z = -1 into z^5 - 1 gives -2. In a sense the error here is natural: there are two sets of fifth roots of unity with sign, one set disregarding sign. That is, there are two natural ways to orient a pentagon in the complex plain to represent roots of unity; one way you showed with the pentagon &quot;pointing&quot; in the positive-x direction, and one you didn&#39;t show pointing in the opposite direction (where zeta_0 = -1 = -exp(2pi x / 5).

Although it seems local, this war is changing the world. In the end, after all the pain, the parties will establish new relationships, and new relationships will be established around the world. This war is the beginning of a formation of a new world order, where all parties unite against the one common enemy of all of humanity: egoism. It will take time, but everyone involved will realize, and the whole world with them, that they are not fighting against each other, but against an enemy within them. If we let the idea sink in, even a bit, it will make it happen even sooner.<br>The war that began in late February will not end soon. It will take many more months until everyone realizes that war itself, the very concept of it, is evil. In that sense, the war in eastern Europe is correcting all of humanity, transforming our perception and our understanding of good and evil.<br>The casualties, the injured, and the lost property are a terrible price to pay. Nevertheless, global processes always come at a cost. We should not blame others for the cost, and we should not think that there is nothing each of us can do to change the world. It is in the hands of every person to change the world for the better, and to make the atrocities of war, and all atrocities that humans are inflicting on each other, disappear. All we need is to realize that the only enemy lies within us\u2014our self-centered attitude. It incites us against each other, demonizes and vilifies anyone who disagrees with us, tells us that we are the only ones entitled in this world, and thereby sets us off against each other. We are all like that, infected with a pandemic of narcissism.<br>Nevertheless, there is a lot we can do to change the world. First, we must accept that there is a good reason we are so different from each other. Each of us makes a unique contribution to the world that no one else can. If we were all the same, the contributions we receive from others, and on which our lives depend, would be absent, and we would not survive, in the most physical sense of the word.<br>We will realize that our ego is the enemy only when we realize that singularity is the wrong key word for happiness. Today, the key word for happiness is complementarity\u2014mutual satisfaction of each other\u2019s material, social, emotional, and spiritual needs.<br>We are living in a world where we are all dependent on each other. The food we eat, the clothes we wear, and the appliances and gadgets that we use are all made by people we do not know, in places we do not know, and reach us in ways we do not know. But were it not for this chain of myriad unknown individuals, we would not survive, since we cannot provide for our needs by ourselves.<br>The same goes for social ties. All our connections, communications, and interactions with other people are made possible with the help of countless people who serve us without our awareness. But were it not for them, we would not be able to work or socialize.<br>Despite this obvious fact, we behave toward others with as little consideration as possible, and when we are nice or considerate, it is because we have an ulterior, selfish motive. We do not have the prerogative to keep up this behavior. We are destroying the world and destroying ourselves.<br>Back in the 1930s, Baal HaSulam, a great thinker and a great kabbalist, wrote an epic essay titled \u201cPeace in the World.\u201d In it, he writes, \u201cMan is inherently born to lead a social life. Each and every individual in society is like a wheel that is linked to several other wheels placed in a machine.\u201d How odd it is that ninety years ago, before World War II, people already realized that we are all dependent on each other and must behave toward each other with consideration. Just think what we could have avoided had we been more attentive and open-minded.<br>Now, too, we are headed for a catastrophe unless we pay attention and begin to act like one entity, one global society that works like a single, united family.

However, I&#39;d like to push back a bit against the suggested significance of the complex numbers for this problem. In particular, the analogy with the Riemann hypothesis seems a bit thin: in the latter, to even sum the Dirichlet series, we actually need some notion of convergence (analysis) and then the procedure of analytic continuation (again analysis). On the other hand, in this problem the only features of the complex numbers that we really used were purely algebraic. The video does mention this at the end when it is pointed out that what really helped us is the cycling behavior of \u03b6.<br><br>To make this more precise, let&#39;s completely &quot;algebraicize&quot; the argument. Consider the ring R = Z[X]/(1 + X + X^2 + X^3 + X^4) and denote by a the image of X in this quotient. Obviously Z embeds in R. Because the polynomial we are quotienting by is irreducible (Eisenstein&#39;s criterion), it is prime (Z[X] is a UFD), so R is a domain. Observe that<br><br>0 = (1 - a)(1 + a + a^2 + a^3 + a^4) = 1 - a^5,<br><br>hence a^5 = 1. It is now easy to reason that a^n = 1 if 5 | n and a^n =/= 1 otherwise. Thus, if 5 doesn&#39;t divide n, we have (since R is a domain and we may cancel)<br><br>(1 - a^n) (1 + a + a^2n + a^3n + a^4n) = 1 - a^5n = 1 - 1 = 0<br>1 + a + a^2n + a^3n + a^4n = 0<br><br>If p(X) is the counting polynomial from the video, we can now calculate that p(1) + p(a) + p(a^2) + p(a^3) + p(a^4) is an integer (remember that Z embeds in R), indeed, precisely 5 times the sum of the coefficients that we want. And the rest of the calculations should work as in the video (the last trick, writing X^5 - 1 as a product, also works unchanged since 1, a, a^2, a^3, a^4 are distinct zeroes of this polynomial).<br><br>All this is not to say that using complex numbers is somehow &quot;wrong&quot;, I like it more that the method just described because C is more familiar and hence easier to think about than this weird R. (Actually, I think it&#39;s true that R is isomorphic to the subring of C generated by \u03b6, so this approach is likely completely identical with the one in the video when the dust settles.) My only point is philosophical: the continuous world is pretty much irrelevant for this problem, we only want a machine that knows how to deal with period 5 behavior for us, whereas in parts of number theory (and I know very little about this) it is the actual analytical (&quot;continuous&quot;) properties of objects that give us information about the discrete. Of course everyone will take away different things from the video and the point I&#39;m trying to make may seem obvious to some, but I felt it may have become somewhat obscured amidst all the other stuff going on.", "comment_date": "2022-05-29T12:12:33Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Andrea Santamaria", "comment_text": "My brain exploded when I realized that it\u2019s possible to write: sum(i=0, n) c(n,i) = 2^n , basically every stage n of the Pascal\u2019s triangle if summed up gives back 2^n since the polynomial used here is (x+1)^n and evaluated it in x=1", "comment_date": "2022-05-29T11:57:14Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "I Wormix", "comment_text": "I am not sure, that I understood even the 20 % of the video, but I am sure, that this guy is brilliant", "comment_date": "2022-05-29T10:39:59Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "\u041d\u0438\u043a\u0438\u0442\u0430 \u041b\u0443\u043a\u0430\u0448\u043e\u0432", "comment_text": "Really amazing!

And I thought I could post it here.<br>Let&#39;s consider a set {1,2,3,4,5} and specifically remainders mod_5 of sums of elements of its subsets. We can see that remainder 0 appears 8 times and all the other remainders appear 6 times each. The same would be true for set {5k+1,5k+2,5k+3,5k+4,5k+5} for any k in N.<br>Now let a_n be the number of subsets of {1,2,...,5n} whose sum has remainder 0 and b_n be the number of subsets of {1,2,...,5n} whose sum has remainder 1. Similarly let&#39;s introduce c_n, d_n, e_n for the remaining remainders.<br>Let&#39;s now consider a sets {1,2,...,5n} and {5n+1,5n+2,5n+3,5n+4,5n+5}. Notice, we can join a subset of {1,2,...,5n} with a subset of {5n+1,5n+2,5n+3,5n+4,5n+5} in such a way that the new set has a remainder of 0 in a_(n+1)8a_n+6b_n+6c_n+6d_n+6e_n=2a_n+6(2^(5n)).<br>a_n+b_n+c_n+d_n+e_n=2^(5n) because both left and right hand side represent the number of subsets of {1,2,...,5n}. Thus we have found a recursive formula for a_n.<br>a_n=2a_(n-1)+(6)2^(5n-5), now by repeatedly plugging in the formula for lower and lower terms of the a_n sequence we get:<br>a_n= 2^n(a_0)+6sum_(0&lt;=i&lt;=n-1),(2^(n-1+4i))= 2^n+(6)2^(n-1)(2^(4n)-1/2^4-1) [we use a formula for a finite geometric series and the fact that a_0=1 since by definition it is the number of subsets of the empty set whose sum is divisible by 5. And well, it is sensible to assume sum of elements of an empty set is 0. ]<br>After simplifying the final expression we get a_n=[2^5n+2^(n+2)]/5.<br>So to answer the original question we just need to plug in n=400.

Imagine for example you have 3 shirts which you&#39;d consider using on a given day, labeled A, B and C. The total space of (mutually exclusive) possibilities for &quot;shirt usage&quot; is encoded by the information A + B + C, where the sum is abstractly meant to indicate mutually exclusive events or situations. If you also have 2 pairs of shoes you could use, say X and Y, then to encode both these situation at once, where non-exclusive and simultaneous choices are made, you&#39;d consider the expression (A+B+C)(X+Y) = AX + AY + BX + BY + CX + CY. This abstraction can carry over to different situations, and the generating polynomials one can obtain are simply the reduction of this total information to a subset that matters to us for the given problem, say, the quantity of choices. We &quot;evaluate&quot; A = B = C = X = Y = 1, since each represent a choice, and we have 6 possibilities. <br><br>Now consider a box which contais 2 blue balls, 1 red ball, and 1 green ball. The possibilites for taking out any amount of balls from the box is encoded in the polynomial (1 + a + a a)(1 + b)(1 + c), as one could guess from these principles and &quot;evaluating&quot; this expression. If for this particular problem we want to make evident the number of balls we are choosing, we consider the polynomial (1 + aX + aaX^2)(1 + bX)(1 + cX), where the exponent of the formal variable X indicates the quantity of balls associated to each situation. Evaluating this expression according to X gives a neat decomposition of the problem in terms of the amount of balls taken from the box, and considering our previos situation, where a = b = c = 1, we find that the n-th coefficient of the polynomial exactly corresponds to the amount of possibilities in taking n balls.", "comment_date": "2022-05-28T15:23:28Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "omar bachiren", "comment_text": "<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bOXCLR3Wric&amp;t=33m33s\">33:33</a> Pablo Escobar", "comment_date": "2022-05-28T15:13:20Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Pineapple Whatever", "comment_text": "2^1600 brute-force approach: Skip all multiples of 5 when considering subsets.", "comment_date": "2022-05-28T14:54:23Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Luke Sciarappa", "comment_text": "Trying to think of <b>why</b> the complex numbers are, as you say, so central to so much.<br><br>&quot;Well, what we kind of used here is being algebraically closed --- we wanted a number other than 1 whose fifth power was 1.

Suppose, for S(k) = {1,...,5k} there are N(k) subsets with 0 mod 5 sums; then N(k+1) = 8*N(k) + 6*[2^(5k)-N(k)]; This is easy to see: if we consider the new elements {1&#39;,2&#39;,3&#39;,4&#39;,0&#39;} augmenting by union any old set contributing to N(k) with any new set in Unions over { {0&#39;}, {1&#39;,4&#39;}, {2&#39;,3&#39;} }, we are getting 7 new sets in addition to the 1 old set back (from union with the empty set) for a total multiplier of 2^3=8 ... hence 8*N(k); conversely, there are 2^5-2^3=24 nonempty subsets of our new elements {1&#39;,2&#39;,3&#39;,4&#39;,0&#39;} with nonzero remainders modulo 5; with 6 sets having respective remainders of each of 1, 2, 3, 4; and we know 2(^5k)-N(k) subsets of S(k) have nonzero remainders where union with 6 new appropriate complementary remainder sets will produce a new set of remainder 0 mod 5 ... hence 6*[2^(5k)-N(k)].

For example, when the subsets have 2 elements, the first 2 in the list are {1,5}, {2,4}, whose sums of elements are congruent to 1 modulo 5, and the following {2,5}, {3,4} are congruent to 2, and so on. A quick check leads us to the following observation:<br>If we choose x elements where 0&lt;x&lt;5 from S to make a subset (so we have 1 to 4 elements in the subset) such that the sum of the elements in the subset is congruent to n modulo 5, the number of choices are the same for any n.<br>For example, if we are going to choose 2 elements from S to make a subset such that its sum of elements is congruent to n modulo 5, there are always 2 choices no matter what n is.<br><br>Step 2: Analyze a harder case of S={1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10}<br>The analysis serves as an intermediate step before we go to the case when S={1,2,3,...,2000}.<br>Let us split S into A={1,2,3,4,5} and B={6,7,8,9,10}. Any subset of of S can be made bijectively through combining a subset from A and another from B. For example, the subset {1,2,8} from S can be recovered from combining the subset {1,2} from A and {8} from B, and note that such process is bijective. Consider now we choose x elements from A and y elements from B to make a subset T in S. Here comes the key: if at least one of x and y is not 0 or 5 ((x,y) not equal to (0,0), (0,5), (5,0), (5,5)), from step 1, we would conclude given fixed x and y, there are equivalently many ways to make the sum of elements of T congruent to n modulo 5 for any choice of n. If (x,y) are in the 4=2^2 possible choices, which are (0,0), (0,5), (5,0), (5,5), we make 4 possible subsets T&#39;s whose sums of elements are divisible by 5. Hence, the total number of subsets whose sums of elements are divisible by 5 is (2^10-2^2)/5+2^2.<br><br>Step 3: The answers to the case of S={1,2,3,...,2000}<br>Much like step 2 in which we split S into 2 partitions, but this time we split S into 400 partitions {1,2,3,4,5}, {6,7,8,9,10}, {11,12,13,14,15},..., {1996,1997,1998,1999,2000} (you may realize this is not the only way we can split S. As long as in each of partitions there are 5 elements which are not congruent to each other, and different partitions do not share same elements, the way we split S would give us the same result). Now we choose x_1 elements from the first partition, x_2 elements from the second,..., and x_2000 elements from the last partition to make a subset T in S. There are 2^400 choices of (x_1,x_2,x_3,...,x_2000) such that none of x_m is an integer from 1 to 4, and the total number of subsets whose sums of elements are divisible by 5 is (2^2000-2^400)/5+2^400.", "comment_date": "2022-05-27T09:48:19Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "YeloPartyHat", "comment_text": "I actually encountered this problem while building a language processing algorithm!

Funny how math works out, eh? The only thing we care about are remainders. On {1..5} we get 8 counts of 0 and 6 counts of each other option. Now consider the {6..10}. The count of remainders of subset sums is identical to {1..5}. And you get remainder 0 on {1..10} by a union of subsets from {1..5} and {6..10} when remainders add up to 0 or 5. So 0+0, 1+4, 2+3, 3+2, and 4+1. And every pairing is unique, since the spans don&#39;t overlap. So 8*8 + 4(6*6) = 208 subsets with remainder 0. The other four remainders get 204 each. Generalizing the math for this, call the number of subsets with remainder zero of a span A to be z(A) and for any other remainder, u(A). Then, if you write out the results for unions, we can solve for the difference between counts with remainder zero and any one of the non-zero remainders: z(A+B) - u(A+B) = (z(A) - u(A)) * (z(B) - u(B)). Since z({1..5}) - u({1..5}) = 2, and we&#39;ve established this works for every grouping of 5 thereafter, z({1..2000}) - u({1..2000}) = (z({1..5}) - u({1..5}))^400 = (8 - 6)^400 = 2^400. And since we know that z({1..2000}) + 4u({1..2000}) = 2^2000, we can now solve for u({1..2000}) = (2^2000 - 2^400)/5, and of course what we&#39;re looking for z({1..2000}) = (2^2000+4*2^400)/5, which is the same answer unsurprisingly.<br><br>While more direct, this is nowhere near as elegant, of course, but essentially works for the same reason.

You need exactly those pairings to make 5, so your options are with/out 1/4, with/out 2/3, and with/out 5. That&#39;s 3 bools, so 8 options. Scaling that up to the set 1..10, you now have twice as many numbers to pick for each bit. So instead of pairing 1/4, you can pair 1/4, 1/9, 6/4, and 6/9. But if you pair 1/4, you can also choose to pair 6/9 or not to. So you really just need to pick the same number of elements from 4/9 as you pick from 1/6.

Since we are interested in the remainder of a sum of numbers mod 5, imagine a five-hour clock labeled 0 to 4. Above each number put a light bulb corresponding to numbers between 1 and 2000 whose remainder is the number you chose (so 6 is above 1 etc. Basically you separate the numbers by their equivalence class  mod 5.). When you choose your subset, you are going to switch on the respective light bulbs.<br>Now, let&#39;s call s their sum mod 5. If s is not 0 then, you can choose to add 1, 2, 3 or 4 to all numbers (so basically the whole clock rotates by 2*k*pi/5, with k=1...4, with the understanding that 2000+1 = 1 etc.) and doing so will add k*|S| mod 5, where k is the number you added to all numbers and |S[ is the size of your subset. Since Z/5Z is a field you are bound to find a value k such that k*|S| = -s mod 5. Even better, that value k is unique! So for any configuration of light bulbs there is one way to turn the clock so that the corresponding sum is 0 mod 5.<br>Coming back to our clock that means that we have to find the number of different configuration understanding that two configurations are indentical if you can get from on to the other by a rotation in R_5. <br>This is exactly a problem for Burnside&#39;s lemma !

Think about how Cartesian product of sets distribute with disjoint unions of sets. So, it becomes our multiplication. So, the list of all subsets can be factored as you did. The x in the generating function is nothing but a place holder.

(I&#39;m not sure how many lines to skip to get youtube to hide the later bits, so I&#39;ll probably overdo it a bit.)<br><br><br><br><br>For some subset of {1, ..., 5n}, consider just its intersection with {1, ..., 5k}, where k&lt;=n. In particular, consider the sum of the elements up through 5k. There&#39;s some probabilities that it&#39;s 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4 (mod 5). Now consider how this might change as we add on the next five to arrive at the sum of the elements up through (5(k+1)). There&#39;s a 4/16 chance the sum (mod 5) doesn&#39;t change and a 3/16 chance that it changes to any particular other value (mod 5).<br><br>Now we&#39;re gonna split that into two cases- and this is where the magic happens. You can rephrase the previous probabilities like this: there is a 15/16 chance that the result is set to a random value (0, 1, 2, 3, or 4), completely &quot;forgetting&quot; any information about any past values of the sum- including that it started at zero (when k=0). There is a 1/16 chance that the value (mod 5) stays where it is.<br><br>So the only way for a later value of the sum (mod 5) to be in any way dependent on the fact that the sum started at zero and not some random value is for a 1/16 event to happen for every 5 numbers we climb on our way to get to 2000. That is, this case happens for 1/((2^4)^400) = 1/(2^1600) of the possible subsets.<br><br>Since there are 2^2000 possible subsets, this means that the number of subsets which sum to a multiple of 5 is:<br>(2^2000) [ (1/(2^1600)) + (1/5)(1 - (1/(2^1600)) ] = (1/5) [2^2000 + 4(2^400)]<br><br>In short, the error is just how likely the sum is to &quot;remember&quot; where it started, and the likelihood of this happening is independant and fixed for each unit of five in {1, ..., 2000}.", "comment_date": "2022-05-26T01:40:06Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Mauro M", "comment_text": "Is this solution expected from high school students?", "comment_date": "2022-05-26T01:34:21Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "josav09", "comment_text": "Besides the generating function I&#39;m glad I got the main idea behind the solution as some way of using the periodicity of imaginary numbers as a modulus-type operand", "comment_date": "2022-05-26T01:27:56Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Morgan Presley", "comment_text": "Has anyone else tried the bonus problems at the end yet?

So, with natural notation, we get:<br>r1=r2=r3=r4=1/5*(2^2000-2^400)<br>r0=1/5*(2^2000-2^400)+2^400=1/5*(2^2000+4*2^400)<br><br>I like this symmetry argument very much :)", "comment_date": "2022-05-25T20:29:34Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "\u51af\u796f", "comment_text": "Thank you 1000 times!

If we had a less nice problem, or accepted a lot of compute, we could evaluate this with dynamic programming. This recursive formula is somewhat annoying since it is different depending on n mod 5, but we can apply it 5 times to get a linear recursive formula from `f_r(5n)` to `f_r(5n+5)`. This can be seen as multiplying the vector `f_r(5n)` with a matrix, which could be done using fast exponentiation since we are multipying in the same matrix from the left 2000/5 = 400 times.

How complex numbers are extremely useful in that they are a tool we simply don&#39;t have access to with real numbers. And he specifically said it is extremely helpful, but I cannot stress enough just how helpful it is. The problem with real numbers is that they are entirely binary, they are either positive or negative, no in between (except for 0). And as much as we can pretend that is totally okay in our world, where so so many things are binary, we need diversity. And you can think about the difference between real and complex numbers by how they are represented. Real numbers are all on one straight line, and you are either to the left or to the right of zero, whereas with complex numbers, we have the complex plane which is two-dimensional, meaning you have four quadrants to play with but also diversity on where you are on each quadrant. This is what gives us the ability, through complex numbers, to select a frequency! If you want something to alternate, the real number --1 works just fine, but if you want a cycle every nth power, there is always a complex number that is the nth root of unity that&#39;ll give you exactly that.

This was one hell of a trip though that I&#39;m glad we went on.<br><br><br>Take the set, [1,2000]. Make five copies of it. We can now form five sets of the same size, where each one only has certain numbers mod 5. The first is all numbers x_1 = 1 mod 5, the second x_2 = 2 mod 5, and so on. The easiest of the new sets to evaluate on how many subsets with a sum equal to 5 it has is x_5. As every choice will lead to a number equal to 0 mod 5, there are 2^2000 such subsets. The other ones are almost as easy. As you make a subset from them, the number of elements in the subset, n, will multiply the modulus. x_1(n) = 1*n mod 5, x_2(n) = 2*n mod 5, etc. To make these numbers 0, aka divisible by five, we need n to be a multiple of five. To ease the brain, we can make groups of five from the numbers in a set, where the specific numbers selected doesn&#39;t really matter.  From such groups, there are 2^(2000/5) = 2^400 such subsets, and they all are divisible by 5. So we have 5*M(2000, 5) = 2^2000 + 4*2^400 -&gt; M(2000, 5) = (2^2000 + 4*2^400)/5, which is the answer.<br><br>A general solution would be as such:<br>{ M(n, d) = (2^n + (d - 1)*2^(n/d))/d , when d = 1 mod 2,<br>{ M(n, d) = (2^n)/d , otherwise (aka d = 0 mod 2 or is even).<br><br>Extra points:<br>1. Even numbers are different because for every subset x_1 = 1 mod 2 adds to the total, it takes away from the x_2 = 2 mod 2 set. The different sets do interfere in the final sum.<br>2. The specific numbers chosen for groups not mattering is an extension of point 1. For each such set of groups that can be formed, interference takes them away. At the end, only one such group is considered for each set x_1 - x_4.<br>3. These are what I think is happening. This is not rigorous.

The answer is striking and as another poster mentioned, it is reminiscent of Burnside&#39;s theorem. I&#39;ll outline a solution below. <br><br>Imagine 400 &quot;concentric&quot; pentagons. Label the vertices of the innermost pentagon 1-5, with 1 at the top, proceeding clockwise. On the next largest pentagon, label the vertices 6-10, 6 at the top, proceeding clockwise again. Now, color the vertices with one of 2 colors, say red or green. If the pentagon is fixed, there are 2^2000 ways to do this. When vertex is green, include it in the subset, exclude if it&#39;s red. Consider two colorings equivalent if one can be obtained from the other by a rotation of 0, 72, 144, 216, or 288 degrees. By Polya&#39;s enumeration/Burnside, there are (1/5)*(2^2000 + 4*2^400) ways to color the vertices. The catch is that in each group of equivalent colorings, one and only one set of green-colored vertices will be a multiple of 5. Thus, the number of colorings is equal to the number of subsets whose sum is a multiple of 5.<br><br>To see this a bit better, for the simpler {1,2,3,4,5} case, consider just one pentagon and suppose three consecutive vertices are colored green, the other two red. This corresponds to the five 3-element subsets {1,2,3}, {2,3,4}, {3,4,5}, {4,5,1}, and {5,1,2}.

Unfortunately, I failed. However I did manage to come up with a combinatorial solution that does not involve a &quot;leap of faith&quot;, but that is constructive. Instead of the sum of the numbers in a subset I looked at the remainder of the sum upon division by five. I started with just the first five numbers. There are 8, 6, 6, 6 and 6 subsets with remainders 0, 1, 2, 3 and 4, respectively. Then I added the next five numbers: 6, 7, 8, 9 and 10. I determined the number of subsets with different remainders by combining subsets of {1,2,3,4,5} with the subsets of {6,7,8,9,10}. It turns out the this can be written as a matrix-vector multiplication. The vector contains the various numbers of subsets of {1,2,3,4,5}, the resulting vectors contains those of {1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10}, and the matrix is A=[8,6,6,6,6;6,8,6,6,6;6,6,8,6,6;6,6,6,8,6;6,6,6,6,8]. Adding five more numbers and repeating the calculations means simply multiplying again with this matrix A. Repeatedly adding five numbers until we have all 2000 shows that the number of subsets of {1,2,3,...,2000} with different remainders can be found in the first column of the matrix A^(2000/5). Here is where I failed to avoid complex numbers, as I couldn&#39;t see a way to calculate A^(2000/5) without them. I diagonalized A, raised the diagonal matrix to the power 400, and then transformed back. This is surprisingly straightforward, but the matrix that diagonalizes A contains the (complex) fifth roots of unity. The final result is, of course, (2^2000+4*2^400)/5, but also that the number of subsets with other remainders are all (2^2000-2^400)/5.", "comment_date": "2022-05-24T18:51:28Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "AHuggingSam", "comment_text": "This was really beautiful, I just have a question related to it:  This is not to detract from this solution which is probably more generally useful, and very beautiful but I&#39;m wondering: Can you solve this problem using the binomial expansion of the generating polynomial?

Prepare five symbols z_1, ... , z_5. We shall represent each subset with &quot;product&quot; of z_i&#39;s so that i is in the subset. For example, {1, 2, 5} is represented by z_1z_2z_5 and the empty set is represented as an &quot;empty product&quot; which we will denote by 1. Now, we have the collection of products each representing a subset. Denote this bag of products by putting plus signs between them, so our bag looks something like\r<br>\r<br>S = 1 + z_1 + ... + z_5 + z_1z_2 + ... + z_1z_2z_3z_4z_5. \r<br>\r<br>The reason for choice of symbols + and * will be clear soon. Now, what we want to do is to &quot;collect&quot; the \r<br>subsets having the same sum. Thus, for example, we want \r<br>\r<br>z_2z_4 = z_1z_2z_3. \r<br>\r<br>To achieve this is quite simple, just let z_k = x^k, and this is the reason why we chose product notation. This substitution makes each product representing a set with sum k to become x^k. Hence, coefficient of x^k in S is just the number of subsets with sum k. This also makes it clear why we use + inbetween our symbols. That way, two x^k&#39;s in the bag of products will be collected into 2x^k. Now, just note that \r<br>\r<br>S = (1+z_1)(1+z_2)...(1+z_5)\r<br>\r<br>by algebra magic and voila, substituting z_k = x^k gives us the desired formula.<br>\r<br>Another interesting side note here, this idea can be used to &quot;collect&quot; \rseveral things. For example, suppose we want to &quot;collect&quot; the subsets having the same size. Thus, in our symbols, we want for example z_1z_3 = z_2z_5 = z_1z_2. To achieve this, one can just let z_k = x for all k. \rIn that way, each product representing a subset of size k will be become x^k and hence, coefficient of x^k in S is just the number of subsets of size k. voila the coefficients are just binomial coefficients as expected. All in all, choice of * is that subsets having the same sum will have the same representation, and choice of + is so that we can collect the representations that are equal.\r<br>\r<br>But to admit, this motivation only came to me after seeing something like this somewhere else. I would have never discovered such a clever idea of enriching the bag of combinatorial objects with an algebraic structure if I haven&#39;t seen it before. \r<br>\r<br>By the way, I really enjoyed the video!

The last triangle is a mirror of the first triangle, so we can erase it by adding its surface to the first one, making it a square that we can merge with the rectangle to get a broader rectangle. To make up for that, we substract the length of the triangle (=height*2) from the total sum (2001000-1000=2000000).<br>Now, things are easy: we just find the number of values that are multiples of the given value (e.g. 2000000/5=400000) and we multiply it by the height (400000*1000=400000000); finally, we add the empty set, and the full set if we didn&#39;t count it and it&#39;s a multiple of the given value (400000001).<br><br>Let&#39;s see if my prediction is correct and my result accurate once we get to the end of the video.<br><br><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bOXCLR3Wric&amp;t=13m30s\">13:30</a> OK, the first reactangle is accurate, but I have to check and polish the extremes of the graph.<br><br><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bOXCLR3Wric&amp;t=29m50s\">29:50</a> nope, not closely; I failed terribly.

We start this by figuring out a_1 = 6, b_1 = 8 by hand.<br>Now let&#39;s describe how to obtain a_{n+1} from a_n and b_n (you can also consider us to be using a_1 and b_1).<br><br>Any subset A in S_{n+1} can be decomposed as the disjoint union of A\u2099 = A \u2229 S\u2099 and A_1\u2245A\u2099 \u2229 (S_{n+1}\\S\u2099).<br>If sum(A) has residue 1, this leads to one of the five cases for the residues of sum(A\u2099) and sum(A_1):<br>1 and 0 which occurs in  a\u2099*b_1 = 8a\u2099 cases.<br>0 and 1 which occurs in b\u2099*a_1 = 6b\u2099 cases,<br>2 and 4, 3 and 3, and 4 and 2, amounting to 3*a\u2099*a_1 = 18a\u2099 cases.<br><br>This means that a_{n+1} = 26a\u2099+6\u2099.<br>  <br>For sum(A) having residue 0, there are really only two different cases:<br>0 and 0, accounting for b\u2099*b_1=8b\u2099 and<br>r and -r, accounting for 4*a\u2099*a_1 = 24a\u2099, so<br>b_{n+1} = 24a\u2099+8b\u2099.<br><br>4) We have now obtained a_0 = 0, b_0 = 1 and <br>a_{n+1} = 26a\u2099+6\u2099,<br>b_{n+1} = 24a\u2099+8b\u2099.<br><br>Setting v\u2099 = (a\u2099, b\u2099)^T, M = [[26, 6], [24, 8]], we can now write<br>v\u2099 =M^n v_0. This already allows for an incredibly efficient algorithm to find a\u2099 and b\u2099 which takes O(log(n)) time.<br><br>5) We can also find an exact form of M^n using diagonalization M = SJS^(-1)<br>where<br>S = [[-1, 1],\u00a0<br>          4, 1]]<br>J = [[2, 0],\u00a0<br>       [0, 32]]<br>S^(-1) = [[-1/5, 1/5],<br>                [4/5, 1/5]]<br>and v\u2099 = M^n v_0 = SJ^nS^(-1)v_0 =\u00a0<br>S  [[2^n, 0], [0, 2^(5n)]] (1/5, 1/5) =\u00a0<br>1/5 * [[-1, 1],\u00a0[4, 1]] (2^n, 2^(5n))= <br>1/5 * (2^(5n) - 2^n, 2^(5n) + 4*2^n).<br><br>In other words, we obtain the same answer as in the video:<br>a\u2099 = (2^(5n) - 2^n))/5<br>b\u2099 = (2^(5n) + 4 * 2^n))/5<br><br><br>6) As one can see, this approach is significantly more technical and calculation-heavy, although it also, imo, contains some beautiful ideas. One might think that this approach allows us to avoid complex numbers, given that they weren&#39;t used at any point in the solution, but that is, in a certain sense, an illusion. The entries of J are really complex, which would be more evident if we had to perform the same steps for, say, the Fibonacci numbers. It is true though, that they were only used for step 5.", "comment_date": "2022-05-24T12:22:13Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Yellow Toad", "comment_text": "Comment #10^3", "comment_date": "2022-05-24T12:20:43Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Sword Of Strife", "comment_text": "This is probably the most beautiful math video I have ever watched.

Even when all numbers in a given problem are real, you should remember that those numbers are complex with a zero imaginary component. All numbers are complex numbers, even if they\u2019re <i>pretending</i> to be real!<br><br>So, why did complex numbers show up in this counting problem? It was simply something that could not be easily explained with real numbers.<br><br>Otherwise, it would be like optimizing a function without using differentiation. Algebraically, it is still possible to optimize something, like the vertex of a parabola or a local extremum of a quartic curve. Anything more complicated than that may be nearly impossible algebraically, although theoretically still possible. But if you just look at rates of change (which extends from algebra and is considered basic calculus), optimization becomes so much easier and simpler, even if the non-calculus, algebraic approach would be nearly impossible. So in the context of this example, algebra is to real numbers as calculus is to complex numbers.<br><br>You may as well treat all real numbers as complex numbers with a zero imaginary component, just as you would treat all functions as having inherent rates of change that you can consider for more advanced analysis.<br><br>Anyway, in general, if a pattern works for real numbers, then you should expect it to work for complex numbers (if applicable). If it doesn\u2019t, then there might be a flaw in your conjectured pattern in real numbers.<br><br>Of course, special things happen when numbers have no imaginary component. It\u2019s why many problems are set purely in the domain of real numbers. But if the domain is never specified, then you should assume that any number <i>can</i> be complex. For counting problems, pretty much no one ever said that you can only use real numbers to solve the problem.

If we add the next 5 numbers (1; 2; 3; 4; 0) just expanding by hand, each number ends up as 6*sum+2*(the number itself). Since b, c, d and e are 0 at the beginning, we can see that they will always stay the same. If we also remember that a+b+c+d+e=2^5i, we can express a as a recurring function.

If the number is divisible by zero, your total number of subsets doubles, all the previously divisible by 5 can include this number and still be divisible by 5 (0 mod 5). Makes sense. What if it&#39;s not though? Say you had 6 (1 mod 5). That does nothing for your existing 0 mod 5 subsets. However, all of your 4 mod 5 subsets can include this value and now become 0 mod 5. Interesting. So that&#39;s all the motivation we need to build this solution.<br><br>Let&#39;s represent the current count of subsets with an addition n mod 5 by a vector. For the empty set this would be x = [1,0,0,0,0] as the only subset it itself with sums to 0 (0 mod 5). <br><br>Now let&#39;s imagine how this vector evolves as we add elements to the set. If we add a multiple of 5, all the subsets can include this without changing their sum (mod 5). So this will double the count of each.

This transformations looks like the identity matrix + the identity with all the columns shifter to the right and wrapped around 1. <br><br>The same can be said for mod 2, 3, and 4.

We need to apply of 400 of each. Order is irrelevant so pick your poison for how to calculate it but the matrix is:<br><br> (T_0 x T_1 x T_2 x T_3 x T_4) ^ 400.<br><br>This could be represented as Tx^400 = Tx^256 * Tx^128 * Tx^16.

This also explains why the number of subsets is 2^N : the nth digit of the string is a choice between 0 and an element of the set. since there are N digits this is 2^N possibilities. <br>Knowing this correspondence, it&#39;s easier to see that one way of making the problem more algebraic is by constructing some object that emerges from chosing things and multiplying them: a product of N binomials is perfect for that job since you have N choices to make and 2 possibilities for every choice (2^N exactly like the number of subsets!). <br>What should the binomials be though? Well, one thing we probably want is something that can &quot;count&quot; the sum of the elements since we want that information to divide by 5, and in retrospect it&#39;s easy to see that having powers of x in the binomials achieves this. I don&#39;t think it&#39;s easily plucked out of the air but it makes sense: since exponents add they can count the sum of the elements for you if you make them exactly equal to the elements themselves (or we could see it as making every nth exponent equal to the nth digit of our string) . Also, we probably don&#39;t want 0 or a minus sign in our binomials since they would make a bunch of terms disappear and we want them to be exactly 2^N, which makes it less mysterious (at least I think so) why we have a product of (1+x^i) binomials", "comment_date": "2022-05-24T05:37:40Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Yamanoki", "comment_text": "The &quot;leap of faith&quot; that you&#39;ve described to reach the generating function doesn&#39;t really seem leap-y to me.

The use of fifth roots of unity here reminded me of one of my favorite proofs, which shows that 2*cos(2\u03c0/5) = (sqrt(5) - 1)/2, the (reciprocal of the) golden ratio. If, as in the video, we define \u03b6 = exp(2\u03c0i/5), then it&#39;s easy to show that \u03b6 + \u03b6^4 = 2*cos(2\u03c0/5) and \u03b6^2 + \u03b6^3 = 2*cos(4\u03c0/5) by using the identity exp(i\u03b8) = cos(\u03b8) + sin(\u03b8). But consider the polynomial p(x) = (x - \u03b6 - \u03b6^4)*(x - \u03b6^2 - \u03b6^3) which has these as its roots. Multiplying this out and using the fact that \u03b6^5 = 1 gives p(x) = x^2 - (\u03b6 + \u03b6^2 + \u03b6^3 + \u03b6^4)*x + \u03b6^3 + \u03b6^4 + \u03b6 + \u03b6^2. But since  1 + \u03b6 + \u03b6^2 + \u03b6^3 + \u03b6^4 = 0, so \u03b6 + \u03b6^2 + \u03b6^3 + \u03b6^4 = -1, and therefore p(x) = x^2 + x - 1. By the quadratic formula, the roots are therefore x = (sqrt(5) - 1)/2 and x = -(sqrt(5) + 1)/2. But we already knew what the solutions were, so it must be the case that 2*cos(2\u03c0/5) = (sqrt(5) - 1)/2 and 2*cos(4\u03c0/5) = -(sqrt(5) + 1)/2 (you can tell by the signs that it can&#39;t be the other way around).", "comment_date": "2022-05-24T02:32:32Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Ion Ymous", "comment_text": "In my work and life I don&#39;t do much more than high school level math.

The curve your integrating over is basically a semi circle that runs along the x axis from -R to R and then loops in an anticlockwise direction back to -R. And then you say R --&gt; inf. It turns out any closed loop&#39;s integral is always 0 for analytical functions in the complex plane. Functions that aren&#39;t analytic have things called poles (points where the function goes to infinity), which themselves each have a value attributed to them called a residue.<br><br>The integral of a closed curve is equal to 2i*pi*(the sum of the residues of the poles contained by the curve). You then find where this has poles (goes to infinity) - in this case at 1+z^4=0, or z^4 = -1 - calculate the residues for each of the poles which lie above the x-axis (the only ones contained in the semi circle of infinite radius defined earlier), and you have your integral for the original real function.<br><br>In this case it ends up being pi/sqrt(2).

My current best guess is Floor((2^2000)/5)+2^400. So its very close to a 1/5th and moving closer as a % but the gap is increasing as raw number.. I also counted the empty set as a total of 0 so it counts as dividable by 5. <br><br>Here is my basic logic. All sets will fall in one of 5 camps. Team 0: meaning it is divisuable by 5. And Team 1-4: which have a remainder of there team.  With this we can find a seed value of 1,0,0,0,0. So we at least know where we start. Next when we add a number, if remainder is 0. We can simply double all teams as there is the ones we can make before and also ones we could make before + the new number. If the remainder is 1, we add all Teams with the one that is 1 more then it (4 wraps around to 0). We do this logic for shifting one more over for 2, 3, and 4. This works but is far from ideal but it gave me data to look at. (thanks excel)<br><br>From this data I try to divide by 2 every 5th number as its just a pure doubling and makes us just grow faster and I can factor this out for the most part hoping the number be more mannable. It doing work as well as I hope but it did do something at least. But it didn show a pattern for all the teams. Every 5th element started to be X, X, X-1, X-1, X-1 (team 0-4).  I dont know the logic on way this is the case that they keep the pattern of this but it seems to be holding true.<br><br>Also even more madness,  instead of keeping track of all teams, there is another function that i found that seems to work for team 0 (the team we care about) where if the number you add is remainder of 1 or 2, you do A_n= 2*(A_n-1)-1 and for all the others you just do A_n = 2(A_n-1). I have no idea why this pattern is currently working but it keeps up with the other method till the spread sheet breaks. if I were to make a guess, when you add a new 1 or 2 need to be parasitic in that they need to break an old pair to make a new one. Vs 3 and 4 can use the new parasitic 1 and 2 to make new fives.5 doubling is very straight forward.

Usually these generating functions aren&#39;t this fun!!<br>Anyway, here are my solutions to your problems:<br><br>1. When we take the derivative on both sides we end up with the identity: 1/(1-x)^2=\\sum_{n=1}^{\\inf} nx^{n-1}. Now let us call P_n, the probability to not roll a 1 in the first n rolls. In each independent roll the probability of not getting a 1 is 5/6- therefore P_n=(5/6)^n. Now the probability to roll a 1 on the n-th roll is P_{n-1}*1/6. Therefore the expectation value of the number of rolls needed to get a 1 is N=\\sum_{n=1}^{\\inf} n*(5/6)^{n-1}*(1/6)=1/6*\\sum_{n=1}^{\\inf} (5/6)^{n-1}*n=1/6*1/(1-5/6)^2=6 by our previously proven identity evaluated at x=5/6.<br><br>2. Consider f(x)=(1+x)^n. By the binomial theorem f(x)=\\sum_{k=0}^{n} x^k (n choose k). Evaluating this at x=2 gives the answer of 3^n to the problem. Note: we can interpret every binomial coefficient as the number of subsets of a set with n elements that have k elements. Therefore it is the number of ways to pick k objects out n. This combinatorically proves the binomial theorem since the coefficient in front of x^k is exactly the number of ways to pick k x&#39;s out of n of them.<br><br>3. Taking the derivative once gives us:<br>F&#39;(x)=\\sum_{n=1}^{\\inf} f_n x^{n-1}/(n-1)!=\\sum_{n=0}^{\\inf} f_{n+1} x^n/n!<br>Similarly, after taking another derivative and re indexing gives:<br>F&#39;&#39;(x)=\\sum_{n=0}^{\\inf} f_{n+2} x^n/n!<br>Now since f_{n+2}=f_{n+1}+f_n that trivially gives F&#39;&#39;(x)=F&#39;(x)+F(x). Now this is a second order linear DE and we can solve its characteristic polynomial  is q^2=q+1 which has famous solutions, the golden ratio \\phi and his &quot;little brother&quot; \\phi&#39;. Now this gives us a solution to the DE: <br>F(x)=Ae^{\\phi x}+Be^{\\phi&#39;x} for some real numbers A,B. Evaluating at x=0 gives A+B=f_0=0. &lt;now we get by expanding the Taylor series for the exponential terms:<br>\\sum_{n=0}^{\\inf} f_n x^n/n!=A(\\sum_{n=0}^{\\inf} (\\phi^n-\\phi&#39;^n)x^n/n!. Now comparing coefficients we get:<br>f_n=A(\\phi^n-\\phi&#39;^n), and evaluating for n=1 we get 1=A(\\phi-\\phi&#39;)=A*\\sqrt(5) so A=1/\\sqrt(5). Finally we get what we wanted, a closed form of the Fibonacci sequence:<br>f_n=1/\\sqrt(5)*(\\phi^n-\\phi&#39;^n).<br><br>4. We can use the geometric series: f(x)/(1-x)=\\sum_{n=0}^{\\inf} a_n x^n*\\sum_{k=0}^{\\inf}x^k= \\sum_{k=0}^{\\inf}\\sum_{n=0}^{\\inf}a_n x^{n+k}=\\sum_{j=k}^{\\inf}\\sum_{k=0}^{\\inf} a_{j-k} x^j. Here we&#39;ve taken a re indexing j=n+k. Now if you would multiply out everything and collect like terms you&#39;d get:<br>f(x)/(1-x)=\\sum_{j=0}^{\\inf} (\\sum_{k=0}^{j} a_{k}) x^j so the new j-th coefficient tells you the sum of all coefficients of the original function from 0 to j.", "comment_date": "2022-05-23T23:05:54Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Chris Chen", "comment_text": "Thanks Grant for another great video! The math way of thinking is always fascinating.

Using dynamic programming, if we know the count of combinations consists numbers up to X-1 ending with 0,1,2...9 each, take 5 as example, then the count of combinations consists numbers up to X ending with 5 will be combinations consists numbers up to X-1 ending with 5, plus every combination that consists numbers up to X with X always be included and will have 5 as the last digit. I write a quick python version of the DP:<br>n = 2000\r<br>\r<br>dp = [[0] * 10 for _ in range(2)]\r<br>dp[0][0] = 1\r<br>for i in range(1, n + 1):\r<br>    for j in range(10):\r<br>        dp[i % 2][j] = dp[(i - 1) % 2][j]\r<br>\r<br>    for j in range(10):\r<br>        k = (i + j) % 10\r<br>        dp[i % 2][k] += dp[(i - 1) % 2][j]\r<br>\r<br>print((dp[i % 2][0] + dp[i % 2][5]))<br><br>Hopefully this will work : )", "comment_date": "2022-05-23T23:05:46Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Jonathan Arendt", "comment_text": "I&#39;m so glad you&#39;re making videos again!

Anyways doing this we get 1+x+\u2026+x^{2^n-1} = (1+x)(1+x^2)\u2026(1+x^{2^{n-1}}), which is already a super interesting formula for even untrained eyes, as it related a pure sum on the LHS to a pure product on the RHS. Finally we try to prove this a different way, and realize it encodes binary decomposition of numbers from 0 to 2^n-1.

Since this is a sum, we can just take the derivative of each term and sum them back together. Let&#39;s first look at x^n/n!, the derivative comes out to be nx^(n-1)/n! = x^(n-1)/(n-1)!. Which is just the same thing except with n shifted by 1. So when we sum it together again, the term with n=2 becomes the term with n=1 (you may recognize this as the Taylor series to e^x). However, we still have this f_n term, which is a constant with respect to x, so it is not shifted. This means that the whole term is now f_(n+1) x^n/n!. To take the 2nd derivative, we just do this again, and end up with f_(n+2) x^n/n!. Looking at the right-hand side, we have (sum of f_(n+1) x^n/n!) + (sum of f_n x^n/n!). Since the bounds on the sum are the same, we can combine them to get a sum, where the terms are f_n x^n/n! + f_(n+1) x^n/n! = (f_n + f_(n+1)) x^n/n! = f_(n+2) x^n/n!, which is exactly what we have on the other side.

But: after that, the process has to repeat, with the new starting numbers, since adding 11 is the same as adding 6.<br><br>So, since I knew the relative size of the mod 0 part and the other parts at every fifth step in the journey of allowing one more element, I had a pretty easy algebraic description of the counts:<br><br>c_0(5N)-c_4(5N)=2**N, c_4(5N)=c_3(5N) etc and the sum of all c_j(5N) obviously equals 2**5N. <br><br>Thus, a very simple formula for the 5N-th step, and thanks to the addition rules that started this, an equally simple formula for all intermediary steps. And, ofc, the problem with 2000 elements is just N=400.<br><br>And, having gotten to near the end of the video: Same formula!

So in this case, x (sort of) represents the memory allocated per term\u2014and since the terms of the sequence are coefficients, that means that the data itself is encoded in the amount of memory reserved (rather than data stored inside that memory). Of course, this is a mathematical function and not a program, but it does suggest that an analog could be generated, especially if it were optimized to store that length in fix-sized terms instead of just allocating semi-infinite memory.<br><br>On an unrelated note, I was thinking that the problem would be the same if every term were translated to n % 5 (n mod 5), since that\u2019s the only part of the term that impacts whether the sum is divisible by 5.

This gives you a way to motivate the introduction of generating functions, since if you try to take the Fourier transform of a sequence, what you get is essentially the same as its generating function.\r As an example of this principle, the sequence (..., 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 3, 4, ...) containing the number of subsets of each given sum is the convolution of the 2000 sequences (..., 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, ...), (..., 0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, ...), etc. Thus, in the world of the Fourier transform, you instead have to deal with the product of 2000 terms. Conversely, filtering out only the subsets divisible by 5 is the same as multiplying by the sequence (..., 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, ...), which translates to convolving the Fourier transform with the sum of 5 delta functions with peaks at the 5th roots of unity.

The idea is taken from the book titled &#39;Problems From The Book&#39;, co-authored by Titu Andreescu as well:\r<br>\r<br>Denote c\u2080, c\u2081, c\u2082, c\u2083, c\u2084 as the number of subsets whose sum is 0,1,2,3,4 mod 5 respectively, then taking f(x) = (1+x)(1+x\u00b2)...(1+x\u00b2\u2070\u2070\u2070) evaluated at \u03b6, we have, by compiling coefficients congruent mod 5,<br><br>f(\u03b6) = c\u2080 + c\u2081 \u03b6 + c\u2082 \u03b6\u00b2 + c\u2083 \u03b6\u00b3 + c\u2084 \u03b6\u2074.<br>\r<br>But we know f(\u03b6)=2\u2074\u2070\u2070 (The video has covered this).

ways to choose a subset of {1...5} for any subset of {6...2000} so that the sum of their union is divisible by 5, except there are two extra ways for the subsets of {6...2000} whose sum is divisible
