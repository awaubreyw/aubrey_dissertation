In fact, you don&#39;t hear the individual vibrations at all; your ear is a spectrum analyzer, and what you generally perceive is the frequency spectrum. <br><br>Pitch perception is related to the fact that many sources of sound, such as vibrating string, vibrating column of air in a cylindrical pipe, or a person pronouncing a vowel, have a harmonic frequency spectrum; that is, the frequencies produced are integral multiples of the lowest frequency, which is called the fundamental,  (Actually, the frequency spectrum is a series of lines of nonzero width centered around the harmonics of the fundamental.) A sound with a harmonic frequency spectrum is perceived to have a pitch corresponding to a pure sinusoid at the fundamental frequency; a sound with a different frequency spectrum (such as the sound produced when you strike a snare drum) is not perceived to have a pitch.  <br><br>If the ratio of the fundamentals of two pitched sounds is close to a rational number with a small denominator, many of the lines in the spectra will overlap.

Essentially everything here is wrong, and it takes some explanation of music to understand why. First, the unspoken assumption here is that all musical timbres are harmonic series timbres. In the real world, most aren&#39;t. So the claim that small integer ratios make two simultaneous tones sound &quot;harmonious&quot; only applies to harmonic series timbres, like pipe organs or clarinets. It doesn&#39;t apply to marimbas, xylophones, etc. Second, the definition of &quot;harmonious&quot; and &quot;cacophonous&quot; is incoherent and largely meaningless. What you really mean to say is that some simultaneous tone combinations are acoustically smooth and others are acoustically rough. Alas, acoustic roughness or smoothness don&#39;t predict musical consonance or dissonance very well. <br>Consider the following musical example: a major seventh (C plus B above) sounds acoustically rough. So according to this theory, such a combination of tones sounds &quot;cacaphonous.&quot; That&#39;s true...for the dyad C and B above. But suppose you add in more notes, causing more musical beats?  If you add in C and E and G and then B above, suddenly the formerly &quot;cacphonous&quot; tone combination sounds downright harmonious.  It&#39;s the well-known major 7th chord. This illustrates that mathematicians fail to take account of musical context, and thus constantly get things wrong when they venture into music.<br>Third, this discussion takes no account of tone center and key, as we&#39;d expect from a mathematician with no exerptise in music. The implication made by this video, that acoustic smoothness is the same as musical consonance, is clearly and obviously wrong, and it&#39;s trivially easy to see that by comparing C and G above with a harmonic series timbre as the end of a chrod progression: musically consonant. Now compare a C with a fifth below (that&#39;s F) as the end of a chord progression. This tone combination now sounds musically discordant despite being acoustically smooth. <br>Why?  Because a fifth below suggests to the listener that the key has now changed -- but a key change at the end of a chord progressions leaves us unsatisfied and sound disocncerting and &quot;off.&quot;<br>As always, matematiciains get it wrong when they venture into areas outside their expertise.", "comment_date": "2021-07-07T21:30:41Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Verruca", "comment_text": "If you look at it from the point of view of vibrational modes of a string, it becomes pretty obvious that a harmonic mode can&#39;t possibly be irrational.

If I had your skills I would make a follow up connecting these ideas to the Fourier transform since our inner ear works by performing one mechanically. The cochlea is a tapered piece of tissue thick on one end and thin on the other. The thick end resonates with high driving frequencies, the thin end with low ones (the thicker the stiffer with corresponding higher frequency response). Little hairs output electrical signals in response to the vibration of the given location on the cochlea. The amount of data that needs to be sent to the brain is a function of how much different tones physically overlap on the cochlea.\u00a0<br>This is where it gets fun! Even a pure sine wave resonates in your ear canal; any resonance that does not line up with an overtone will cancel out over time resulting in a reasonable amount of power from the fundamental pitch being converted to other terms in the harmonic series. Thus when you input two sine waves to your ear, they each generate their respective harmonic series which will overlap significantly if the ratio is &quot;sufficiently close&quot; to a simple whole number ratio. Your hypothetical savant is someone who has countably infinite resolving power of spatial correlations on their cochlea which must approach infinite stiffness on one end and infinite flexibility on the other. Also they would have to be listening in a fluid which supports infinitely high frequency harmonics so it couldn&#39;t be made of atoms...

The tolerance for the frequency ratio being a rational number seems reasonable. If our brains are doing FFTs, then the frequency resolution of the estimated spectrum is 1/T.

So, for an exact 2/1 ratio at 500 Hz, the estimated ratio could be (1000-4) /(500 +4)  = 1.98. <br><br><br>Maybe, our brains are not doing a full FFT, but a sparse FFT only at the frequencies of interest. So, if the signal has no power at the output of the sparse FFT, then it sounds bad.  The sparse FFT algorithm could be implemented by the brain by demodulating each frequency with a forget factor.  This implementation would minimize some of the lag associated with an FFT and the memory requirements.  However,  for this to make sense, the fundamental frequency input to the sparse FFT algorithm needs to be estimated quickly and accurately.  With less time, the fundamental frequency estimate is worse, but the presence of harmonics in the signal should be helpful.

If one do this with two simultaneous tones, there are just too many patterns to keep track on, and three simultaneous tones generate even more possible combinations.<br>Another important effect is the effect of experience: something we have heard, for example a tune, will not be sounding the same the next time we hear it due to memory effects.

But I know I can&#39;t be alone when I say there is something about your presentation that makes even simple subjects impossible to understand. It&#39;s possible I&#39;m just not within your demographic as I have no real formal education in mathematics, but I still enjoy the videos produced by Numberphile, Stand Up Maths, and SingingBanana and they are able to compress complicated subjects into more digestible pieces. Your videos just end up being a bunch of words that I understand individually but not when placed in the order that you&#39;ve chosen.\r<br>\r<br>I&#39;m really trying to figure out why though, so that I could maybe offer some actual criticism and not &quot;This isn&#39;t good, make it better&quot; because it&#39;s obvious that a lot of people enjoy your videos. But I really don&#39;t know where they go so wrong as to make matters overly complicated and impossible to follow. I really just end up staring at your visuals and my brain unfocuses because it&#39;s trying to catch up and understand while you&#39;ve moved onto the next topic, with no real flow from the previous one\r.<br>\r<br>For example at <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyW5z-M2yzw&amp;t=0m51s\">0:51</a> you claim that the two notes don&#39;t sound good together, but for all the examples given I found them quite enjoyable, the root 2 provided, for example, was a hauntingly beautiful minor sound, you then lead into your next statement and I&#39;m still trying to figure out what wasn&#39;t supposed to sound good. I think it&#39;s possible it&#39;s due to your 220Hz being played constantly so our brains are able to adjust to that noise so when new notes were introduced it&#39;s almost as if we&#39;re just hearing that one sound coming in, but I don&#39;t know. Either way when you start looking for numbers that sound good together I was thinking that the argument was quite flawed as it&#39;s all personal taste. Which could be the issue with that segment - it&#39;s too arbitrary.\r<br>\r<br>But even when we moved into the second part with the measures I was still left lost. In part this is due to you having words written on the screen while speaking different words. This is a fairly big no-no because we can&#39;t listen to you and understand what you are saying if we&#39;re trying to read and understand a completely different statement (for example <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyW5z-M2yzw&amp;t=6m55s\">6:55</a>).\r<br>\r<br>The challenge laid out at <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyW5z-M2yzw&amp;t=5m52s\">5:52</a> is &quot;Using an infinite amount of intervals, cover all of the rational numbers between 0 and 1 with open intervals. Where each rational number lies within one or more intervals and the sum of the length of all intervals is less than 1.&quot; This is an overly complicated way of saying what you want, but it boils down to you want us to wrap each number within a set (the set of rational numbers between 0 and 1) with an interval. I can&#39;t be alone in thinking that this &quot;challenge&quot; isn&#39;t really a challenge. Like let&#39;s say I want you to wrap each integer number between 0 and 100 with an interval that can be any real number where the sum of the lengths of all intervals are less than 100. Clearly this would be foolish to issue it as a challenge because an interval from 0.9 to 1.1 would contain 1, 1.9 and 2.1 would contain 2, etc. You are using the same challenge but instead of a set of integers it&#39;s a set of rational numbers, but surely the method is the same, you just wrap each individual rational number in it&#39;s own interval that is arbitrarily close to the number within your set. In other words for each number (n) within your set the interval would be n-x to n+x where x is so small that it&#39;s almost essentially 0.<br><br><br>The issue with your video, I think, is you presented this &quot;challenge&quot; clearly with the intention of teaching us some math, which is great, an easy challenge can lead to interesting math, but then your presentation falls flat. At <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyW5z-M2yzw&amp;t=8m15s\">8:15</a> you begin talking about infinite sums, which I have to imagine is the point of your challenge at this point, however, it&#39;s completely skimmed over and I have no idea what point you were trying to make. You lose me when you start talking about epsilon, and then at <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyW5z-M2yzw&amp;t=9m00s\">9:00</a> you assume that the previous statement was a proven fact, when you just barely outlined the method without really proving anything. Of course, then you start talking about your proof where I&#39;m still trying to figure out why were were talking about infinite sums.<br><br>I do have to admit that while writing out this comment and re-watching your video it has begun to make much more sense, but I think that&#39;s also a problem I can&#39;t watch each of your videos 5 times so that I can understand what is being said. There&#39;s just something missing from your presentation style or maybe we just don&#39;t mesh well. At <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyW5z-M2yzw&amp;t=8m22s\">8:22</a> I&#39;m still confused as to why we&#39;re scaling with epsilon within an infinite sum and why we are factoring the sum up by epsilon.

En las diferentes tradiciones musicales del mundo se tienen concepciones muy diferentes de lo que es &quot;sonar bien y mal&quot;, e incluso, en la m\u00fasica occidental (de afinaci\u00f3n igual) un gran porcentaje de la armon\u00eda que la construye contiene intervalos &quot;malsonantes&quot; que se perciben como &quot;biensonantes&quot;.<br>La percepci\u00f3n de la consonancia o la disonancia en los intervalos depende de varios factores como la educaci\u00f3n auditiva en diferentes contextos socio-culturales. Por poner un ejemplo, la idea de consonancia en las escalas t\u00edpicas de la m\u00fasica tradicional de las diferentes culturas de Indonesia es muy diferente a las de Mongolia, Bulgaria o Suiza, as\u00ed, en Bulgaria el intervalo de 4\u00aa aumentada (<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23D\">#D</a>[\u221a2x220Hz]  A[220Hz]) se percibe como plenamente consonante, como en muchas tradiciones de Europa oriental.<br>2- Otro error es la omisi\u00f3n de los diferentes sistemas de afinaci\u00f3n hist\u00f3ricos que han existido en la m\u00fasica occidental donde la concepci\u00f3n de consonancia y disonancia ha sufrido cambios. No es lo mismo la afinaci\u00f3n en la m\u00fasica antigua (Renacimiento, Barroco) que la actual. Adem\u00e1s, la interv\u00e1lica ha cambiado mucho en la m\u00fasica occidental, poniendo como ejemplo la diferente idea que se tenia sobre los intervalos en el Ars Antiqua y el Renacimiento.<br>3- Siguiendo con los errores, los arm\u00f3nicos pueden seguir una secuencia de frecuencias muy diferente a la que entendemos como &quot;natural&quot;: a nadie le suena &quot;cacof\u00f3nica&quot; una campana (de hecho, es muy habitual realizar conciertos), y sus arm\u00f3nicos siguen frecuencias con relaciones con el sonido fundamental muy diferentes a los arm\u00f3nicos de una cuerda tensada.<br>4- Adem\u00e1s, el v\u00eddeo es poco riguroso, pues la nota como ejemplo sonoro que se presenta como 220Hz es en realidad de 110Hz, es decir, una octava m\u00e1s grave, y a partir de ah\u00ed todos los ejemplos de intervalos siguientes (5\u00aa, 4\u00aa, 6\u00aaM) no est\u00e1n en la altura que se dice, sino a la mitad de frecuencia.<br><br>En resumen, independientemente de errores cometidos por falta de conocimiento musical (que se pueden pasar por alto), el error en dar por v\u00e1lida una percepci\u00f3n \u00fanica de lo que suena de forma consonante o disonante es muy peligroso.<br>De todas formas, es un bonito v\u00eddeo cuya idea es interesante.", "comment_date": "2019-02-18T20:16:14Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Curious Human", "comment_text": "i like all your videos, but this one is really confusing.", "comment_date": "2019-02-16T17:35:14Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "L G", "comment_text": "About the paragraph at the end, I find it weird how demonsterable it is that infinity is smaller than infinity squared.", "comment_date": "2019-02-16T06:57:33Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Booli", "comment_text": "Your videos are just amazing.", "comment_date": "2019-02-15T04:15:17Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "LucenProject", "comment_text": "<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyW5z-M2yzw&amp;t=13m12s\">13:12</a> This has helped me get a better grasp of countable vs uncountable infinities far more the many Cantor based videos.

Piano&#39;s and mallet instruments are tuned using &quot;Equal Temperament&quot; which means the distance in frequency between each half step (the key DIRECTLY adjacent to your starting pitch) is exactly the same between the next half step. This would lead to your intervals with a 0.22%-0.90% margin of &#39;error.&#39; Most every other instrument that doesn&#39;t have a fixed tuning system such as brass, woodwinds, strings, and voice, play and sing using &quot;Just Intonation.&quot; What is REALLY cool about just intonation is that the player can manipulate the pitch so it does hit those perfect, simple intervals. Each interval in the key you are playing in (ex. Perfect 4ths and 5ths, Major and Minor 3rds) has a tendency to be sharp or flat. This means the player has to bend pitches slightly to hit these simple ratios in frequency. That is truly playing in tune. Because the piano cannot bend pitches the way wind players, string players, and vocalists can, a piano can never be in tune with itself.<br><br>If you chose to revisit this portion of the video (which I would love to see!), you should look into a few concepts of acoustics to learn about the Equal Temperament, Just Intonation, and the harmonic series.

If this lower note is fairly audible, you recognize the lower (virtual) note and the notes mesh as a single sound. If it is too low, then it sounds like two separate notes working against one another.<br><br>So if you were to play a 440hz note and a 550hz note, you get a chord, because it sounds like the 4th and 5th harmonics of a 110hz note.

Because the frequency of beats is VERY low, it simply sounds like the 4th and 5th harmonics of a 110hz note, but with a timbre that changes at 2hz. This is how equal temperament is still able to sound good despite being irrational. If you listen to pythagoran temperament vs equal temperament, equal simply has more timbre oscillations.<br><br>This is also why you can make virtually no chords down in lower registers, but almost everything in the uppermost registers comes out as a chord. A 30hz and 45hz 5th chord sounds like parts of a 15hz tone.

Indeed our brains DO recognize the pattern crated by ratios diverging too far from rational numbers (with denominators lower than 10). \u00a0I am a Piano tuner, and I know what two notes sound like when they deviate from a pythagorean ratio. They sounds like audible &quot;beats&quot;. So rather than our brains failing at finding the information, it&#39;s more a question of the resolution of the information, and the frequency of the pattern. The pattern is audible as a &quot;beat&quot; because of the adding of amplitudes of the two frequencies and the lack of a clear &quot;node&quot; or repeating silent spot (more on the later). Further, \u00a0the pattern is audible as &quot;beats&quot; instead of a pitch because it&#39;s too slow (or infrequent) for our brains to turn discern as a pitch. So it&#39;s not that our brains are incapable. It&#39;s more like they&#39;re very capable of detecting the disagreement in amplitudes in that range of frequencies. To relate this to the &quot;combination tone&quot; theory, once these these &quot;beats&quot; get fast enough, they become pitches again. That&#39;s how sometimes when two pure pitches are sounded, a third tone, unrelated to the harmonic series, is heard. In short: It&#39;s fractal.\u00a0<br><br>Did you know that the lowest note on a piano, if you could isolate the fundamental frequency, would be heard as a beat of 25 beats per second, instead of a note? In fact on some very long grand pianos, where the fundamental frequency of the low A is allowed to sustain prominently, you CAN hear the &quot;buzz&quot; of those 25hz. The reason you will not hear this on most pianos is because on most pianos you will only be hearing the upper partials of the harmonic series which our brain interpret as the fundamental. \u00a0Which brings me to the most important point that you missed.\u00a0<br><br>Most people think this aforementioned phenomenon occurs because of some psycho-acoustical theory called the &quot;missing fundamental&quot; \u00a0<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Missing_fundamental\">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Missing_fundamental</a> \u00a0<br>BUT, logically, there is never such a thing as a missing fundamental. If ANY two of the upper partials are sounding, there will be some small presence of the fundamental frequency arising out of the interaction of the nodes of the upper partials. Wherever any two of the upper partials are sounding, the 1 thing they are sure to have in common is a shared node occurring at exactly the frequency of the fundamental. WOWZA! SO... in one sense the fundamental isn&#39;t creating the harmonic series, but rather, maybe the fundamental arises out of the combination of all the nodes of the upper partials. or maybe it&#39;s neither or maybe it does&#39; t matter which. lol<br>ttps://<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harmonic_series_(music)#/media/File:Harmonic_series_to_32.png\">en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harmonic_series_(music)#/media/File:Harmonic_series_to_32.png</a><br><br>Now to bring this thinking back to you video. I believe the consonances described in the pythagorean division of an octave are due to the pattern of the frequency of nodes in the upper partials which agree to be the fundamental frequency... roughly. And the nodes only have to roughly agree to create a strong fundamental, because nodes only have to roughly line up to have SOME general effect of a frequency of silence. It&#39;s the frequency of (near)silence that creates the note.\u00a0<br><br>The rest of this video, and all your videos are truly blowing my mind, and I LOVE them, I am learning a lot!!!!

The physical properties of the fluid within with regards to resonance, which are physically the same as really any tube of fluid of course, have the &quot;hairs&quot; arranged such that a frequency at 220 will resonate the &quot;hair&quot; responsible for that frequency and send the info to our brains (it also shakes other hairs nearby, but not as much, and a trained ear can usually pin point these frequencies pretty well given something to refer to like memory in the case of perfect pitch). The fluid resonating at 220hz also has a good chance of resonating at 440hz and there are documented instances of a loud sine wave at some frequency creating a perception of a frequency at multiples of that frequency. The same thing happens when you overdrive a speaker, so maybe that first part is erroneous (the loud sound didn&#39;t create extra harmonic resonance inside the cochlea, but instead the overdriven speaker created this noise), but maybe both happen. There are a bunch of related phenomenon like a note that plays several multiples of a frequency except the 2x and even the 1x multiple results in a perception of the 1x multiple. Again this is documented to happen on a perceptual level and a physical level (frequency subtraction), so the perceptual level observation might have been a failure to account for the physical aspect appropriately.<br><br>The reason for this is the harmonic series. Given a fundamental frequency, let&#39;s say 100Hz, there are naturally harmonic frequencies in most &quot;musical&quot; pitch producing instruments (including the human voice) occuring at n x 100 (n x fundamental). The further we go, usually the less n goes and n can skip even numbers in some cases. So in the case of a Saw Wave or most other instruments, the resulting frequencies called &quot;harmonics&quot; is (in the case of 100) 100, 200, 300, 400, 500, etc.. Notice that these are the numbers you can use in fractions with low denominators (changing the fundamental keeps this relationship exactly the same, and we perceive it as such). By the way we usually perceive this series as just the fundamental frequency with changes in the sound or &quot;timbre&quot; as the harmonics (the &quot;nx&quot; frequencies) change in volume. This is how we distinguish vowel sounds and such in language from each other.<br><br>Personally I think the &quot;rhythm&quot; of frequencies you mentioned plays a role in some ways for sure, but the underlying concept is the harmonic series. Back to biology though.<br><br>A ratio of 3/2 sounds more or less the same compared to the 2^(7/12) relationship probably because there is some variance in what &quot;hairs&quot; vibrate inside the resonating cochlea anyway, and our brains happen to be good at adapting to finely interpret and extrapolate this data in lieu of precise instruments to measure such things built into our bodies. (it helps that the harmonic series is natural and engrained even in humans who haven&#39;t had a chance to hear our system of music). It is worth noting that frequency numbers whose difference is around 2 - 0.2Hz can be very consciously perceived due to the resulting &quot;beat frequencies&quot; (I don&#39;t know the exact extent of these numbers, so this is a very very rough estimate based on memory and zero actual measuring).

My explanation is closer to the following. Intervals sound good if they have nearby equal harmonics. For example if you play a root tone of 100Hz and its fifth 150Hz. The second harmonic of the first tone is 300Hz is the same aso the first harmonic of the second tone 300Hz. The reason this makes more sense comes with evolution. In general, resonant systems in nature will always produce root frequencies with its harmonics but the harmonic components are scaled to different values. Thats why the piano and a trumpet can play the A4 note and still be distinguishable. They all play 880Hz 1760Hz etc as well but in different ratios. Our ears work with resonating hairs so in practice we only pick up the presence of frequencies. If a trumpet makes a noise, we don&#39;t want all the individual frequencies triggered to get our attention so the harmonics &#39;melt&#39; together and they sound good. However, if different sources of sound produce a tone, they will likely have different harmonics and the brain will pick that up and make us &#39;notice&#39; two distinct sounds as potentially dangerous or to say the least: &#39;note worthy&#39; (no pun intended). If we play a C and a G on a piano (1.5 apart roughly) many of their harmonics will be the same and thus the sounds will blend together into a nice soup of consonance. The octave is the best. The fourth has higher harmonics melt together so there are more harmonics (frequencies) that are different and thus it produces a slightly more dissonant sound. To have a very sensitive ear to the blending of two sounds will be of no evolutionary benefit since no resonant system is perfect and will always have small changes in its fundamental frequency so some margin of error is allowed. This explains, in my opinion, the best why two sounds are either consonant or dissonant.", "comment_date": "2016-12-20T21:17:20Z", "likes_count": 65}, {"comment_by": "Chris Jones", "comment_text": "How do you know sqrt(2)/2 is not covered?

I&#39;ll watch a few more times and see if I get it.  I did just want to supplement this video with some additional music history and acoustics information (not that I&#39;m an expert but maybe someone can help me out if I miss something).  The video states that using powers of the twelfth root of two works well because the ratios generated are very close to low-denominator rational numbers.  This is very true, however, it should be noted that using 19th, 22nd, 31st, 41st and 53rd roots is fairly common among microtonalists and theorists to achieve some very pure (meaning close to those low-denominator ratios) intervals.  Makes sense that as the root number increases you have far more numbers to play with and as a result, some of them are more likely to be closer to those ratios.  Also note that not all numbers get good results here.  Using powers of 10th, 28th, 45th roots, or just any random root number, won&#39;t work to well, as they don&#39;t give values as close to the pure intervals.  The ones I listed above are some of the values found to work well.  Maybe there&#39;s a mathematical proof to be worked on there!  Btw, powers of 22nd roots are used in India for tuning.  Just thought this should be added to his explanation so people don&#39;t think there is something especially magical about powers of 12th roots.<br><br>Sorry for this short rant:<br><br>I have stated the following in many a scathing response to a would-be musical-mathematical claim (because it really gets frustrating):  Pythagoras was only the VERY beginning of music theory as we know it - literally.  There have been countless brilliant philosophers, composers, performers, instrument designers and mathematicians working on music theory and tuning in the past 2500 years.  There are countless books, treatises, essays and dissertations on the subject.  I&#39;ve come accross a lot of mathematicians and computer scientists who, obviously not having learned much about music theory, decided to attempt revolutionizing it with their radical new idea.  Usually, it doesn&#39;t apply at all and sometimes reinvents a wheel that we threw away or improved upon hundreds of years ago.  The author of this video isn&#39;t so far off, however, his lack of musical jargon seems to demonstrate a lack of research.  It only takes a couple of short essays or wikipedia articles to pick up some good music theory jargon and certainly to learn the meaning of &#39;dissonant&#39; and how it is used in context, instead of cacophonous.<br><br>end rant<br><br>Lastly, dissonance is subjective and changes through time and culture.  There are charts, made by psychoacousticians, showing some near-universal perceptions of dissonance for &quot;all&quot; intervals.  If we only look at Western music, we will find a time in history when only the 1:2 ratio was acceptable as a &quot;harmony&quot; (it&#39;s really just an octave).  Later, the 3:2 ratio became acceptable, then 4:3, then 5:4 and   so on, later using all of the reciprocal intervals as well.  These denominators are very low.  Our culture has been steadily increasing those lower denominators.  If it seems that we stopped developing this way, that is, stopped at 12th roots in our equally tempered instruments, it is due to cultural-economic factors.  Certainly, there are plenty of musicians using larger denominators (or larger root-based larger octave divisions for equal tempered tunings) and many of them can appreciate and readily identify those intervals.<br><br>If we go back to the 13th century, before ears were accustomed to 3rds (6:5 and 5:4) played simultaneously as a sustained chordal sonority, does the theory presented in this video break down?  If the value of epsilon in this proof is arbitrary, what is the author really saying about our tolerance for dissonance based on distance from the low-denominator ratios?  Also, he is making claims about dissonance, especially in regards to his hypothetical savant, that he is not backing up and may not be provable at all.  What value of epsilon is acceptable for making this connection at all?  Unless I&#39;m missing the point, which is very possible, what I see here is a near-connection or a hypothesis that requires some real experimentation.  What I think is presented here is some very rudimentary and incomplete information about tuning and a very nice proof that may or may not be connected.

Now, most times we hear a frequency we hear it from some object (like an instrument) that generates harmonics of that frequency (ultimately due to ratios of lengths and linear dispersion relations). Now, harmonic frequencies (with simple ratios as you say) share a lot of harmonics themselves. These will excite the basilar membrane in the same spots. And as long as the harmonics don&#39;t differ by more than about 10Hz, they will be indistinguishable (as far as the basilar membrane is concerned, due to bandwidth). However, if you make to non harmonic sounds with two non-conmensurate objects, a lot of their harmonics will  be very close, and within the so called critical frequency, which has been shown to cause dissonant perception. Now, a plausible theory for why even pure sinusodial waves at simple ratios tend to sound better (though I did the test now, two non-harmonic sin waves don&#39;t sound nearly as bad as two non-harmonic piano notes), may be that the brain develops neuronal networks to prefer these sounds.<br><br>Your theory of the brain detecting the rhythms is still interesting though, and may be relevant to the &quot;temporal coding&quot; theoreis that have been proposed, but I have not read much about those..", "comment_date": "2016-02-06T23:31:55Z", "likes_count": 18}, {"comment_by": "realcygnus", "comment_text": "awesome channel !....what do you use to make your animations/sims ?", "comment_date": "2016-01-29T05:02:58Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Misty Mouse", "comment_text": "This is really well done!

So you can say hey these two notes will sound cacophonous, but what about if they&#39;re followed by tsome other random two notes? Secondly, I&#39;ve heard some piano pieces, specifically made to sound cacophonous and being a series of cacophonous chords, that actually sound really well. For example, a really stressful moment. Those notes sound good to illustrate stress, as a score for a scary scene in an anime for example.<br><br>So &#39;cacophonous&#39; is just a point of view.

The cochlea works in the frequency domain and does something similar to a Fourier transform, where every individual tone (i a very hand-wavy sense) applies pressure to one point along the cochlear spiral. A harmonious interval will have many common points between the two notes played, keeping in mind that the two notes will have a number of overtones apart from the fundamentals.<br><br>As far as overtone distribution is concerned, most natural instruments will have overtones corresponding to multiples of the harmonic series over the fundamental. You can however synthesize a sound where the whole spectrum is compressed or expanded, such that each frequency component is shifted by a factor, say 0.9 or 1.1. When doing this, you can create a rather convincing major chord where the fundamentals of the chord notes lie at 0.9*1, 0.9*5/4, 0.9*3/2.<br><br>Some natural instruments do in fact have non-linear overtone distributions, and that&#39;s in fact a pet peeve of mine regarding MinutePhysic&#39;s video. One such instrument is the piano, which needs a so-called stretched tuning the lower octaves are tuned slightly lower compared to the expected tuning, and the higher octaves are tuned slightly higher. When I saw the title of the MinutePhysics video, Why It&#39;s Impossible to Tune a Piano, I was expecting it to mention that phenomenon. The video was about equal temperament, when in fact justly intonated tuning was the norm before ET came around.", "comment_date": "2015-12-10T05:16:44Z", "likes_count": 22}, {"comment_by": "Roydon Chung", "comment_text": "I love watching your videos.
