A stupid scholar all overturned this truth and built it to a convenient system of Mason. Thus, the people believe the trickery of the devil than words of God. What is called brainwashing without expressing brainwashing in this? Darwin&#39;s evolutionary theory, the Copernican theory of Galileo, the theory of relativity, quantum mechanics, mathematics, medicine, the genetic engineering (the gene is the soul of language as for the gene a tool) of Einstein are all errors. A ghost, a UFO (as for the alien a lie), supernatural power, a miracle, telepathy of God, the moment movement to be said to be the occult are rather true. A thing and a ghost (God) exist in the world, and space is active by spiritual power (conception) of God. As for God, all things were created by the soul of language. It is clear if I read the Bible. Because the present scholar mixes the logic thoroughly in human wisdom, it cannot arrive at the truth. It is intuitive power to be important. Why does a child seem to be? The thing which cannot answer this is a mistake. Our common sense is more right than a stupid scholar. The creation of God comes loose only by a fate. Everything becomes the material by a conception of God (person).<br><br>I cannot prove 1+1 = 2 in a numerical formula. I can prove only a physical phenomenon to say that it is in two apples when I match another one apple with one apple. An apple becomes extinct suddenly and does not become 1+1 = 2 like an operation of the other self if a number is quality to increase. It is not 0+1 \u2260 1. As 0 (nothing) is not quality, you must not handle it for a number. Because quality is different even if I match a mandarin orange with an apple, there is not a meaning of the addition. Because it does not exist other than God when I define God as existence (integer), no (0) does not exist.<br><br>If 0 exists by a definition of the mathematics, 0 of the infinity must exist. However, infinite space is infinite (\u221e) and does not exist either. In other words, because the mathematics defines 0, negative number, imaginary number, \u221e which do not exist, it is an error and is a fiction. Therefore it is an error because a zeta function, the numerical formula of the second oiler product deal with this infinity. That it becomes sum of series \u03a3 = 1+2+3+ ... = - 1/12 of the natural number, or the product of all prime numbers is 4\u03c0^2. It turns out that it is an error if I think for common sense. It is limited, and the mathematician seems to get a wrong this, but uses the sophism when I calculate this endlessly if right. This is mistake definition of 0or \u221e and is the evidence that mathematics gets a wrong. It is definition f&#39;(x) = limh of the differential calculus that must not divide it by 0 \u2192 0 {the same as it being 0 that says that I bring h close to 0 without a limit, and dividing it by a numerical formula of f(x+h)-f(x)}/h. I divide it by 0. The mathematics is trickery not study in this way.<br><br>It was done that Einstein who hit the contradiction of the uncertainness theory that became the quantum-mechanical basics returned by contradiction of own theory of relativity and defeated it. When Mitsuko of the one of the boxes of a theory, the light jumps out of a shutter, a spring shrinks, and a box lightens, and true time becomes uncertain because time advances if mass by the theory of relativity lightens. Therefore I concluded that an uncertain theory was right. The principle of constancy of light velocity of Einstein is an error, and the special theory of relativity from it is a mistake, too. Thus, the quantum mechanics is blague.<br><br>I find out a lie of Einstein<br><br>UFOA took off in speed of light C from 0 spots to the right direction, and UFOB took off at the same time in speed of light C from 0 spots to the left direction. In A, B arrived at the point of Ckm from 0 spots to the left at the point of Ckm from 0 spots to the right one second later. The distance of the meantime is 2Ckm. The speed to see UFOB becomes double speed of light C from UFOA. This is right than it is measured in a speedometer. The principle of constancy of light velocity is an error. In other words, the theory of relativity is a lie. I know it even if I think about such a thing for common sense. A law of the addition of the speed is why and is applicable to a material, and is it not applicable to light? Naturally it is applicable to light. Time stops when I exercise in speed of light, and mass becomes infinite. Why is so; cannot examine it. In other words, such a thing is a lie.<br><br>Message of the spiritual world of Einstein <br><br>When oneself saw a scene of heaven through a tunnel of the light in the meantime, the person who experienced suspended animation well is you after the revival. The moving speed of the soul does not receive gravitational restraint anymore, and, as for the law of the speed of light immutability that I discovered during the lifetime, there are none in the world of the consciousness. In other words, I will say that it just moves to say that I think. Furthermore, it is just handed down to a partner to have thought. The life of all of us shares what one interiority. And the material is to say that it was actually consciousness. There are all things in your heart, and, also, you are existence to live in a heart of all life. When all of this space watches it with eyes, it is seen like the outside world, but is to say that the world to be actually seen outside is your interiority. The relativity disappears in here, and this space consists based on &quot;universal truth to certainly say to call God&quot;. <br><br>The scientists equal to my younger student arrive at an outbreak point of the space named the BIC barn from my formula and seem to argue variously, but, as for it, do not have a meaning too much. This is because it is in one, and an infinite opening and all properties that a phase contradicts it at all called at the infinite end and the eternity exist in this space. In other words, it includes the whole (God) at the same time that it is 1, and it is a religious concept to say that the whole is 1 (God) at the same time.<br><br>\u203bLet&#39;s prove that the Copernican theory of Galileo is a lie<br><br>I should be able to observe movement to rotate of the earth from a flying airplane, but seem to hardly move. The atmosphere and the airplane are at one with the earth and do not rotate. Because the wind blows from all directions of north, south, east and west, the atmosphere is not restricted on the earth. Because freedom can navigate the airplane in the atmosphere, I am not restricted by the atmosphere. The botfly flew lightly when I observed the state that threw a botfly in the airplane which was surely flying, and flew without being affected by the inertial force that the weight of the botfly by the speed of the airplane brought about. This is evidence to say that I do not produce the inertial force in the airplane shut in. In other words, mind (even if I make a vacuum like) of the space before and after the horsefly denies an inertial force. An air pocket after the object exercises creates the inertial forces. Therefore an inertial force acts forward if an inertial force acts after the airplane and slows down suddenly. However, the atmosphere on the earth flows in the state that is not pasted on the earth freely. Therefore the driving force of the airplane damps by just that much if an airplane navigates it against the inertial force (by the centrifugal force) to the east direction by the rotation of the earth to the west direction. As for the inertial force that the rotation of the earth of 1,700km per an hour produces, it is thought about with a considerably big thing enough an airplane not being able to move.<br><br>The speed of the rotation of the earth of the neighborhood of equator is 1,700km per an hour. If the ground moves at this speed when an airplane lands, the airplane is completely demolished by the shock. The reason why it is not completely demolished is that the earth does not rotate.<br><br>The ball draws a righthander and can bend into the partner on a merry-go-round of rotating it anticlockwise when I pass a ball. If shoot a mark, can bend with a rifle in the same way; and there is not the thing equal to the mark.<br><br>All the origins of the scientific theory are random, and a bottom is broken. For example, in the theory of elementary particles, an electron joins atoms together and becomes the molecules. A thing joining a proton and a neutron together is a mesotron, and three quarks connect the proton, and there is it. An electron and a positron (antimatter) occur from a photon. An elementary particle to tie the elementary particle to whenever a new elementary particle is discovered is necessary and loses the relations with an elementary particle and the elementary particle more and more. Though a proton and the neutron are the same mass, why does a difference occur in having electric charge or not? The science has no answer with it in these questions. An electron is a material so that I think, and the positron is not a material in the hole of the material loss that the circumference was surrounded by in the soul children. In other words, the antimatter is an illusion. The scholar is going to examine it logically and loses sight of the truth. The structure of built nature of God is simpler, but is the thing which it is hard to understand in the human wisdom. A photon seems to have a particle and the two characteristics of the wave, but, in fact, the light has the property of the wave in the soul children.", "comment_date": "2021-09-25T07:00:40Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Max Waller", "comment_text": "<b>\u00a1this posting is so informative that i clicked subscribe with bell notifications at 12:29 PM Pacific Daylight Savings Time on Friday, 24 September 2021 Common Era or CE formerly known as Ano Domini or AD!</b>", "comment_date": "2021-09-24T19:28:51Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Bam Gb", "comment_text": "Did you drop something at <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vKqVkMQHKk&amp;t=13m22s\">13:22</a> ?", "comment_date": "2021-09-24T12:24:55Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Devansh Sanghvi", "comment_text": "We miss you man!

Sure, it is potentially valid to say that change at a moment does not exist, and that change only exists as a comparison of states at different times. However, it is just as potentially valid to say that states at different times do not exist, that the present is all there is and past and future are illusions, and so that all that exists <b>is</b> instantaneous rate of change, which also would include encoded in it the changes in instantaneous rates of changes as it goes through its... development. By that explanation, the creation of calculus you&#39;ve overviewed really is a compromise with the fact that at any given moment we need measurements to go on to use any facsimile of the rise/run formula, and so we do the best we can with evidence of what happened a minuscule amount of time ago (essentially now) and what happened just a minuscule amount of time before that, as you described. It&#39;s just that it could be argued that both of those measurements are occurring exactly in the present moment, and regarding traces of a time (the &#39;past&#39;) that cannot be proven to exist.

The issue with the idea of velocity is that it requires more than one point in time to compute, or even visualise. You need at least two pictures of a car, slightly different from each other, to show them sequentially as to give out a feeling of &#39;motion&#39; or &#39;change&#39;. This is similar to how videos are shot by taking a lot of pictures at diffrent points in time and showing them one after other to give a feeling of &#39;motion&#39;. Velocity is like a video, spread over multiple points in time, so a single point in time( a single photo) can&#39;t do anything to help us. We need at least two.<br>But the function v(t), unfortunately, knows only how to take in a single point in time as an input.<br><br><br>2. The solution to this problem, is taking two points in time that are extremely close (i.e small dx) and slowly let them closer and closer to the point where those two points are so close, that you might as well assume them as a single point in time. In this way, by letting dx approach 0, and letting the points be really close, we can have two points in time which are different enough for computation but close enough to be taken as a single point.<br><br>This is like having two photos which are slighly different, so as to give a feeling of motion when played sequentially, but also that change is so small that to the naked eye, they may pass as identical.<br><br>3. But we notice a strange thing as we bring those points closer and closer. When they, almost, coincide, the ratio we are trying to compute turns into the slope of the line passing through that point. <br><br>Meaning, essentially, the rate of change that we are trying to compute is actually just the slope at every point of that function.<br><br>I feel like my mind is gonna explode.<br>And I have an exam next week.\ud83e\udd26\u200d\u2642\ufe0f", "comment_date": "2020-12-08T08:06:12Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "anil sharma", "comment_text": "How much impact required to give jerks are very much required to find out the stability of any building so we require this derivative of energy with respect to rest position <br><br>Show something about it ??", "comment_date": "2020-12-07T07:33:21Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Alberto", "comment_text": "Could we say that in 0 the car is static but at any a&gt;0 it&#39;s moving?", "comment_date": "2020-12-07T00:20:50Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "An Un-employed Human", "comment_text": "How did you explained this to me I am ten and I am not smart.

The idea of infinitesimal changes is a really nice intuition for calculus, and an entirely valid one to build a rigorous foundation from. I really think the &quot;approaches zero&quot; approach to calculus, and all the nasty notational trainwreck entailed by the epsilon-delta definition of the limit, throws all that elegance and intuition out the window in a misguided quest for rigor. To me, nonstandard analysis (an unfortunate and derisive-sounding name to rival that of imaginary numbers) is so much more elegant and intuitive as an (equally rigorous) foundation for calculus that I think it should be the standard introduction; sure, discussion of limits and such is important and needs to be done eventually, but to throw all that intuition out for it is just... heartbreaking. Instead of trying to make the intuitive rigorous, &quot;standard&quot; analysis abandons intuition altogether.<br><br>Also, perhaps my perspective has been warped from years of working with calculus, but I&#39;m not sure I agree that an instantaneous rate of change is inherently nonsense. Kinetic energy, for example, is proportional to the square of just such a property (velocity) - and yet kinetic energy is clearly a physical phenomenon. There are tons of examples in the physical sciences of instantaneous rates of change having intrinsic physical meaning. You get back to this at <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vKqVkMQHKk&amp;t=15m27s\">15:27</a>, but I don&#39;t think you&#39;ve actually struck upon a paradox or mathematical insight - you&#39;re just using imprecise language. Is the car moving? Depends on what you mean by moving. If you mean the velocity - the first derivative - then, no, it&#39;s not. It&#39;s moving on the open interval (0, \u221e). In that case, your <b>next</b> question is &quot;when does it start moving?&quot; Again, this could be interpreted in several ways. If you mean &quot;what&#39;s the last time at which the car has zero velocity,&quot; then the answer is clearly t = 0. If you mean &quot;what&#39;s the first time at which the car has nonzero velocity,&quot; a very different question, then there&#39;s no answer - it&#39;s a faulty question. Open intervals on the continuum just don&#39;t have a first point. It doesn&#39;t start moving at any particular value time, but immediately after t = 0. Alternatively, we could interpret the word &quot;moving&quot; to include acceleration and all higher-order derivatives of position (which is perhaps closer to our intuitive notion of movement), in which case the car is indeed moving at t = 0. None of these interpretations are a paradox. It&#39;s just a failure to map imprecise natural language to mathematics.<br><br>I don&#39;t want to sound too harsh here, as I love your content and believe this series is a blessing to beginning students.

Perhaps the derivative could be the rule that shows the relationship between 2 dimensions, allowing us to show and display the relationship between 3d, and 4d, on a graph?

First off you make great videos that have helped me learn to communicate the language of mathematics when I teach my math and physics students.This definition of the derivative comes from a limit so it avoids this paradox of the instantaneous rate of change.  The same thing can be said about integration.  Modern mathematics is heavily tied with limits.  This is pretty standard for those with majors of physics and mathematics.  <br><br>However what is happening when you change perspectives and start working with infinite numbers and infinitesimals? After looking into chunks of model theory the idea of instantaneous rates, and infinitesimals has gained new meaning and avoids this idea of limits elegantly.  I find it very useful when trying to think through physics problems involving very small nudges to systems rather than thinking about this limit idea all the time.  I find the thinking more natural than the idea of the limit and it has helped me clean up my calculus and physics problem set up and has even helped me understand limits better.<br><br>Anyway are limits of small changes and infinitesimals the same thing or different things? I still can&#39;t answer that question. They feel different but I can&#39;t be sure if they are actually different. Is there something infinitesimals do better than limits and vice versa? In your opinion do infinitesimals fix the instsntanious rate of change paradox without avoiding it like the limits do?

When a distance, s, becomes infinitesimally small, it ceases to be referred to as delta s and becomes ds. When a time interval becomes infinitesimally short, it ceases to be referred to as delta t and becomes dt. IV is then defined as ds/dt. Note that a particle, say, has still moved between two points and has still taken a certain time to do so. But the distance moved and the time taken are both infinitesimally small.

Well after starting med school i got involved with research and everyone in the lab was super smart, they showed me how to use programming in a way that would make me interpret results faster and in a more visual way and now i am very passionate about programming and applying it in medicine. I am starting AI courses this summer and i&#39;m starting with calculus. Do you think you could recommend 2 good calculus books one at a beginner and one at a intermediate level?

This is the sense in which the rate of change is &quot;instantaneous;&quot; if you take any (open) interval of time that includes that instant, no matter how small, the derivative at that instant is fully determined by only that interval.

If you download the photo from the internet , you will get a compressed version of it that, can even have the same resolution and quality, but lose the EXIF, because the computer cutomatically detects areas of the photo with the same color pattern and approximates them to a single average color, but by doing that , again, you LOSE the EXIF.<br><br> You can use the shutter speed, along with the apparent &quot;lenght&quot; of the motion blur and use some sort of scale, like the diameter of the tires to figure hot how big a pixel is, at a certain depth layer and count how many pixels the motion blur affects and BOOM you calculated the speed <br><br>Paradoxically, this is easier to do with a cheaper camera, like one on a smartphone, because it has a smaller aperture (which basically means you need to open the shutter for longer to get the same amount of light to create a nice image)<br>and, also it would be better if you did it at night ,because not only does this mean you have a dramatically slower shutter speed and you have the car&#39;s headlights tracing a clear line that makes the job of estimating the distance way easier", "comment_date": "2018-01-02T17:06:47Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Zahid", "comment_text": "Thanks a lot ...Sir...<br>It cleared all my confusions", "comment_date": "2017-12-31T15:05:09Z", "likes_count": 2}, {"comment_by": "Kiki That's it", "comment_text": "s", "comment_date": "2017-12-29T18:26:09Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Kiki That's it", "comment_text": "u", "comment_date": "2017-12-29T18:26:00Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Kiki That's it", "comment_text": "l", "comment_date": "2017-12-29T18:25:55Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Kiki That's it", "comment_text": "u", "comment_date": "2017-12-29T18:25:50Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Kiki That's it", "comment_text": "c", "comment_date": "2017-12-29T18:25:45Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Kiki That's it", "comment_text": "l", "comment_date": "2017-12-29T18:25:39Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Kiki That's it", "comment_text": "a", "comment_date": "2017-12-29T18:25:33Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Kiki That's it", "comment_text": "c", "comment_date": "2017-12-29T18:25:29Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "The Old Craftsman", "comment_text": "3Blue!Brown.

Leaving out the indetermination expanding the formula as the video shows we obtain the derivative function without any paradox at any point.

I Emphasize: second point is from the straight line. As straight line have the proportional property \u0394s/\u0394t=ds/dt=s/t we discover the infinitesimal rate of change (and Pontual value s/t) to be the same to a big rate of change in the straight line (\u0394s/\u0394t as Big as we wish), best linear aproximation, and all of this condensed in the derivative definition formula.

Additionally, you realize that once you&#39;re really looking for a tangent line, then you realize that an &quot;instantaneous rate&quot; is nonsense, since there&#39;s nothing separate from the slope of a tangent line or the slope of a secant line (i.e. both line&#39;s slope is calculated by rise/run, and the &quot;run&quot; part of the tangent line being &quot;close&quot; to 0 is an illusion, because you could find an equivalent line that would be the same slope at all other points except where the &quot;run&quot; is zero: i.e. a hole in the graph that you can just fill in by saying that you can get infinitely close to that point, close as you&#39;d like).<br><br>I mean, honestly, its kinda foolish to always think about derivatives as the &quot;velocity.&quot; For example, we could just as easily think of derivatives as the &quot;instantaneous force&quot; of work done over a &quot;small&quot; amount of distance.

It got translated and published 1993 and thus i gave a little presentation about it. I learned a very helpful perspective about this paradox back then. You can consider the instantaneous rate of change as not instantaneous, but arbitrarily instantaneous...sort of like what you refer to as constant-approximation. The idea is, that for any necessary practical purpose accuracy of calculating a velocity, with the notion of infinitessimals, you can always calculate an accuracy that is higher then the one required. This way, infinitessimals enable you to obtain a &#39;practically infinitely small&#39;  instantaneous change. Just kind of like: more instantaneousser than what you are requiring now. I hope this makes sense. It really is just a twist on the notion, tends to zero...whatever you need, an infinitessimal will provide you with a &#39;virtual quantity&#39; small enough to get every job done. Like calculating the circumference of a circle with pi.

As a math PhD student and instructor of undergraduates, I watch your channel to absorb new ways of explaining things and for general teaching inspiration, and it never disappoints.<br><br>In this video, though, there was one part that struck me as a bit odd: the discussion at the end (starting <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vKqVkMQHKk&amp;t=14m17s\">14:17</a>) contrasting &quot;zero derivative&quot; with &quot;no motion.&quot; In demonstrating that &quot;instantaneous rate of change&quot; thinking can cause problems (which it can, for sure), it seems like you&#39;re making the following argument:<br><br> - Thinking of derivatives as instantaneous rates of change leads you to think that derivative zero implies no motion. (<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vKqVkMQHKk&amp;t=15m00s\">15:00</a>)<br> - On the other hand, we have an example where the derivative is zero at the moment the car begins to move. (<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vKqVkMQHKk&amp;t=15m06s\">15:06</a>)<br> - &quot;No motion at the time the car begins to move&quot; is a paradox.<br> - The problem with our intuition is the &quot;instantaneous&quot; part: we have to remember that the derivative requires referencing multiple points in time. (<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vKqVkMQHKk&amp;t=15m23s\">15:23</a>)<br><br>To me, conceptually, taking a derivative involves two steps:<br> 1) Look <b>locally</b> at the point in question. That&#39;s subtly different (as I&#39;m sure you know) from looking at a snapshot: looking locally means restricting ourselves to asking only questions whose answers are available in every neighborhood of the point in question, no matter how small that neighborhood is, but looking at a &quot;snapshot&quot; would mean looking only at that one particular value.<br> 2) <b>Summarize</b> what you see with a linear approximation. That is, beyond the value of the function at the point in question, we&#39;ll be able to see the slope of the approximating line, but no other local data.<br><br>The &quot;is the car moving?&quot; paradox is a subtlety around step 2. That is, we can still determine whether the car is moving by looking at local data, but we discarded the answer when we summarized with a linear approximation. (Personally, I&#39;d say &quot;the car is moving at t&quot; should mean &quot;the function is not locally constant at t&quot;.)  On the other hand, the &quot;derivatives aren&#39;t really instantaneous&quot; insight you&#39;re trying to convey is about subtlety in step 1. That is, it&#39;s about distinguishing between local data and a snapshot.

Depending on your view of the underlying reality behind certain physical laws, some might call this a genuine &quot;instantaneous rate of change&quot;, but it still leaves the question of what exactly that phrase means.  <br><br>As far as setting the stage for learning calculus, and inventing the math needed to capture this concept, I do think it&#39;s important to recognize that the idea of a &quot;change&quot; makes no sense when you blind yourself to all but an instant.  This is why the derivative of a function, which extends the idea of a rate of change to make sense for a single instant, is intimately tied to the function&#39;s value around that point.  Perhaps there is a statement to be made about how physical laws determining the state of a system at a given time are intimately tied with the surrounding points in time, but that is beyond the scope of the series.", "comment_date": "2017-04-29T16:49:50Z", "likes_count": 333}, {"comment_by": "Eran Boodnero", "comment_text": "incredible videos as always!!", "comment_date": "2017-04-29T16:49:21Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Barry Hughes", "comment_text": "We are truly\u00a0honoured and privileged to have access to the thought processes of the giants who have gone before.", "comment_date": "2017-04-29T16:49:19Z", "likes_count": 91}, {"comment_by": "Cowmoo83", "comment_text": "Fun fact: The reason the displacement function is denoted by s(t) goes back to the German word for distance, &quot;strecke&quot; (despite the fact that this is the word for distance and not displacement).", "comment_date": "2017-04-29T16:48:30Z", "likes_count": 53}, {"comment_by": "kymion", "comment_text": "I think if you took every cognitively non-disabled person who &quot;hates math&quot; and sat them down to watch this channel and Mathologer, they would completely change their tune.", "comment_date": "2017-04-29T16:48:07Z", "likes_count": 27}, {"comment_by": "C", "comment_text": "<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vKqVkMQHKk&amp;t=15m07s\">15:07</a>, obviously it starts moving at dt seconds after t=0!
