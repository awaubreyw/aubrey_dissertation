The idea of approximating a function through taking many higher order derivatives at one point is simply mind blowing. \r<br>\r<br>After thinking about the video, I now realize the importance of the many tests for series convergence that we had to learn. Taylor polynomials are created to model functions that have real life applications in physics and engineering, and the best approximations we have are Taylor series. We need all the tests for series convergence in order to determine whether or not the Taylor series that we create will actually provide an approximation that will be accurate at a given point! If the Taylor series is divergent then it won&#39;t approximate at all, if it is conditionally convergent it will approximate only within the interval of convergence, and if it is convergent then it will approximate everywhere.

Pure genius, thank you!  However, I have a question you may want to address.  You&#39;re developing the Taylor series for cosine, very well.  In your presentation, finding the higher order constants of this series requires knowledge of the derivatives of cosine.  But how do you know about these derivatives, that they are what they are?  Historically, that was proven by taking derivatives of the Taylor series of cosine in the first place, and seeing that these derivatives match (the Taylor) expressions for sin, -cos, etc.  So the question is how did you know that d(cos)=-sin, in the first place?  Is this a (somewhat indirect) example of a priori reasoning?  We want to get the theory without relying on what is to be developed as part of the development.  It makes better sense and facilitates deeper understanding, intellectually and historically.

But another way to look at it is to start with the principle, which has a value of $1 over the entire duration. The simple interest on that principle is given by x, so it increases linearly. This is also the integral of the principle over time. But the interest ON that interest, say the secondary interest, is the integral of the simple interest term - that&#39;s (x^2)/2. And the interest on the secondary interest, in turn, is the integral of the secondary interest - (x^3)/6. Continuing on the same way, the entire amount in the account after x years is just the taylor series for e^x, where each term is the interest earned on the previous term.", "comment_date": "2017-06-21T22:55:15Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "HydroxyChloride", "comment_text": "This is mindblowingly awesome and awesomely mindblowing !", "comment_date": "2017-06-21T22:29:46Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Sripavan Ch", "comment_text": "this video is exceptionally great!!!!!!", "comment_date": "2017-06-21T06:40:54Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Mr. Coconut", "comment_text": "DID SOMEBODY SAY, EQUAALITTYY", "comment_date": "2017-06-19T15:43:46Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "john r.", "comment_text": "Can you make a video about fourier series approximation please?", "comment_date": "2017-06-18T15:05:30Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "The Fullest Circle", "comment_text": "Can you do a &quot;Who cares about calculus&quot; video?

So much misunderstanding can be avoided if you do. <br><br>If y=f(x) linear, then it is its own tangent, because the slope of all secants \u0394y/\u0394x = m is equal to the slope of the tangent at every point dy/dx = m leading to \u0394y/\u0394x = dy/dx and thereby suggesting that ON THE TANGENT ONLY the symbol/linear operator acting on y called dy/dx behaves like a fraction and can be manipulated like one. Because differentiable functions are locally linear, we can make a very good linear approximation by only considering its tangent locally and thereby enable the use of differentials by the justification above, yielding the simplification f(x+dx)\u2248f(x)+df, where df=f&#39;(x)dx. This gives computational tools like finding f(x)=x^3 at x=4.25 and doing so by linear approximation with the tangent at x=4, i.e. f(4+1/4)\u22484^3+3*(4^2)*1/4=64+12=76 - still very close to the actual value f(4,25)=76,77. There is abundant use of this property in engineering and physics - making drawings and considering changes small enough to be considered linear and then abusing the hell out of differentials.<br><br>Maybe pointing out how Leibniz used differentials and how it connects with modern limit notation: Perceive locally linear functions as literally being composed of line segments between to points (x,y) and (x+dx,y+dy), i.e. slope dy/dx and computing derivatives with that idea - i.e. y=x^2 =&gt; y+dy=(x+dx)^2 &lt;=&gt; dy=2x*dx (discarding dx^2) &lt;=&gt; dy/dx = 2x. And in modern notation: y+\u0394y = (x+\u0394x)^2 &lt;=&gt; \u0394y/\u0394x = 2x+\u0394x &lt;=&gt; dy/dx = lim \u0394x -&gt; 0 2x+\u0394x =  2x.<br><br>(in more detail: Simmons, George F.

(and in the exam i had free choice i blew it anyway). and i somewhat still fail to see the value. sure we have other ways of writing a function, but if i for example already know the derivatives etc what\u00b4s the point of a function that simpler to take the derivative of? that sounds like doubled work. <br><br>I could seer a taylor series as useful if i plotted something, had zero information what kind of function it\u00b4s supposed to resemble and tried to mathematically find a way to describe it.<br> and even than it\u00b4d be a fair bit of work to find a somewhat reliable derivative though that would still be okay. i can match the first term easy peasy i\u00b4m not blind, i can find the derivative at that point. well not the derivative but getting the slope of a tangent line should be doable, and if i have no clue  what my cluster of values resembles , that\u00b4s the best i get. but it would get a head ache to graphically deduce the second derivative around the point, it would get imprecise as heaven knows what, means i would get a hard hard time to get the necessary derivatives.
