A stupid scholar all overturned this truth and built it to a convenient system of Mason. Thus, the people believe the trickery of the devil than words of God. Darwin&#39;s evolutionary theory, the Copernican theory of Galileo, the theory of relativity, quantum mechanics, mathematics, the medicine of Einstein are all errors. A ghost, a UFO, supernatural power, the miracle of God to be said to be the occult are rather true. A thing and a ghost (God) exist in the world, and space is active by spiritual power (conception) of God. As for God, all things were created by the soul of language. It is clear if I read the Bible. Because the present scholar mixes the logic thoroughly in human wisdom, it cannot arrive at the truth. It is intuitive power to be important. Why does a child seem to be? The thing which cannot answer this is a mistake. Our common sense is more right than a stupid scholar. The creation of God comes loose only by a fate. Everything becomes the material by a conception of God (person).<br> <br>I cannot prove 1+1 = 2 in a numerical formula. I can prove only a physical phenomenon to say that it is in two apples when I match another one apple with one apple. It is not 0+1 \u2260 1. As 0 (nothing) is not quality, you must not handle it for a number. Because quality is different even if I match a mandarin orange with an apple, there is not a meaning of the addition. Because it does not exist other than God when I define God as existence, no (0) does not exist. Because the mathematics defines 0, negative number, imaginary number, \u221e which do not exist in the world, it is an error and is a fiction. A number is to count quality. When I am separated from a physical phenomenon, the mathematics does not have the significance of being.<br><br>\u203bIf 0 exists by a definition of the mathematics, 0 of the infinity must exist. However, the infinite space, infinity do not exist. In other words, because the mathematics defines 0, negative number, imaginary number, \u221e which do not exist, it is an error and is a fiction. Therefore it is an error because a zeta function, the numerical formula of the second oiler product deal with this infinity. That it becomes sum of series \u03a3 = 1+2+3+ ... = - 1/12 of the natural number, or the product of all prime numbers is 4\u03c0^2. It turns out that it is an error if I think for common sense. It is limited, and the mathematician seems to get a wrong this, but uses the sophism when I calculate this endlessly if right. This is a mistake of the definition of 0 or \u221e and is the evidence that mathematics gets a wrong. It is definition f&#39;(x) = limh of the differential calculus that must not divide it by 0 \u2192 0 {the same as it being 0 that says that I bring h close to 0 without a limit, and dividing it by a numerical formula of f(x+h)-f(x)}/h. I divide it by 0. The mathematics is trickery not study in this way.<br><br> All the origins of the scientific theory are random, and a bottom is broken. For example, in the theory of elementary particles, an electron joins atoms together and becomes the molecules. A thing joining a proton and a neutron together is a mesotron, and three quarks connect the proton, and there is it. An electron and a positron (antimatter) occur from a photon. An elementary particle to tie the elementary particle to whenever a new elementary particle is discovered is necessary and loses the relations with an elementary particle and the elementary particle more and more. Though a proton and the neutron are the same mass, why does a difference occur in having electric charge or not? The science has no answer with it in these questions. An electron is a material so that I think, and the positron is not a material in the hole of the material loss that the circumference was surrounded by in the soul children. In other words, the antimatter is an illusion. The scholar is going to examine it logically and loses sight of the truth. The structure of built nature of God is simpler, but is the thing which it is hard to understand in the human wisdom. A photon seems to have a particle and the two characteristics of the wave, but, in fact, the light has the property of the wave with the soul body.<br><br> Message from the spiritual world of Einstein <br> When oneself saw a scene of heaven through a tunnel of the light in the meantime, the person who experienced suspended animation well is you after the revival. The moving speed of the soul does not receive gravitational restraint anymore, and, as for the law of the speed of light immutability that I discovered during the lifetime, there are none in the world of the consciousness. In other words, I will say that it just moves to say that I think. Furthermore, it is just handed down to a partner to have thought. The life of all of us shares what one interiority. And the material is to say that it was actually consciousness. There are all things in your heart, and, also, you are existence to live in a heart of all life. When all of this space watches it with eyes, it is seen like the outside world, but is to say that the world to be actually seen outside is your interiority. The relativity disappears in here, and this space consists based on &quot;universal truth to certainly say to call God&quot;. <br><br> Near future to read from revelation and illuminati card of God of days, and to untie it in Japan<br> April, 2020 xx day The United States bombs North Korea. North Korea adds nuclear attack to a big city of Japan and a U.S. base as the retaliation. Japan swats it to a bog of the war, and they are dropped by a plot of the United States. There are China, Russia after North Korea and becomes the fight with Japan, American allied powers and drags the world into World War 3.<br> x moon xx Japan and the United States country attacks it in Japan with the Allied Forces in 2021<br> World War 3 begins in 2021 on xx moon xx day<br> Mount Fuji erupts very much on xx day in October, 2023.

I conquer the world in the life of the hell of the cruel survival of the fittest and am useless even if only oneself is going to be saved. Because a killed animal retaliates for a human being, cancer occurs. The meat which I ate becomes the blood, and a vindictive spirit dwells in a cell when blood does formation to a cell. A human being is cruel, and a fornication, a falsehood, committing theft, the habit of the evil deed of the luxury are not stopped. Eating meat is indirect killing. Why is God that existence of the evil is permitted? It lets you compensate for a human crime by the devil. A disaster, an epidemic, the war damage are the wrath of Heaven. Because a Japanese savior buys the crime of the world people, it is sacrificed. I fall in the trees and plants in spite of the pains then even if I writhe with a hell if it is just and changes the heart and does not straighten an act to measure up to hearts of God. Mason finally leads the world to the World War 3. it is started with nuclear attack to Japan as a pilot light.

The &quot;squared&quot; element is artificially introduced by adding another dimension not included in the geometry\u2014which viewers don&#39;t realize because it&#39;s so natural for us to think in three dimensions\u2014in order to explain something that it isn&#39;t connected to at all.

A stupid scholar all overturned this truth and built it to a convenient system of Mason. Thus, the people believe the trickery of the devil than words of God. Darwin&#39;s evolutionary theory, the Copernican theory of Galileo, the theory of relativity, quantum mechanics, mathematics, the medicine of Einstein are all errors. A ghost, a UFO, supernatural power, the miracle of God to be said to be the occult are rather true. A thing and a ghost (God) exist in the world, and space is active by spiritual power (conception) of God. As for God, all things were created by the soul of language. It is clear if I read the Bible. Because the present scholar mixes the logic thoroughly in human wisdom, it cannot arrive at the truth. It is intuitive power to be important. Why does a child seem to be? The thing which cannot answer this is a mistake. Our common sense is more right than a stupid scholar. The creation of God comes loose only by a fate. Everything becomes the material by a conception of God (person).\r<br> \r<br>I cannot prove 1+1 = 2 in a numerical formula. I can prove only a physical phenomenon to say that it is in two apples when I match another one apple with one apple. It is not 0+1 \u2260 1. As 0 (nothing) is not quality, you must not handle it for a number. Because quality is different even if I match a mandarin orange with an apple, there is not a meaning of the addition. Because it does not exist other than God when I define God as existence, no (0) does not exist. Because the mathematics defines 0, negative number, imaginary number, \u221e which do not exist in the world, it is an error and is a fiction. A number is to count quality. When I am separated from a physical phenomenon, the mathematics does not have the significance of being.\r<br>\r<br>\u203bIf 0 exists by a definition of the mathematics, 0 of the infinity must exist. However, the infinite space, infinity do not exist. In other words, because the mathematics defines 0, negative number, imaginary number, \u221e which do not exist, it is an error and is a fiction. Therefore it is an error because a zeta function, the numerical formula of the second oiler product deal with this infinity. That it becomes sum of series \u03a3 = 1+2+3+ ... = - 1/12 of the natural number, or the product of all prime numbers is 4\u03c0^2. It turns out that it is an error if I think for common sense. It is limited, and the mathematician seems to get a wrong this, but uses the sophism when I calculate this endlessly if right. This is a mistake of the definition of 0 or \u221e and is the evidence that mathematics gets a wrong. It is definition f&#39;(x) = limh of the differential calculus that must not divide it by 0 \u2192 0 {the same as it being 0 that says that I bring h close to 0 without a limit, and dividing it by a numerical formula of f(x+h)-f(x)}/h. I divide it by 0. The mathematics is trickery not study in this way.\r<br>\r<br> All the origins of the scientific theory are random, and a bottom is broken. For example, in the theory of elementary particles, an electron joins atoms together and becomes the molecules. A thing joining a proton and a neutron together is a mesotron, and three quarks connect the proton, and there is it. An electron and a positron (antimatter) occur from a photon. An elementary particle to tie the elementary particle to whenever a new elementary particle is discovered is necessary and loses the relations with an elementary particle and the elementary particle more and more. Though a proton and the neutron are the same mass, why does a difference occur in having electric charge or not? The science has no answer with it in these questions. An electron is a material so that I think, and the positron is not a material in the hole of the material loss that the circumference was surrounded by in the soul children. In other words, the antimatter is an illusion. The scholar is going to examine it logically and loses sight of the truth. The structure of built nature of God is simpler, but is the thing which it is hard to understand in the human wisdom. A photon seems to have a particle and the two characteristics of the wave, but, in fact, the light has the property of the wave with the soul body.\r<br>\r<br> Message from the spiritual world of Einstein \r<br> When oneself saw a scene of heaven through a tunnel of the light in the meantime, the person who experienced suspended animation well is you after the revival. The moving speed of the soul does not receive gravitational restraint anymore, and, as for the law of the speed of light immutability that I discovered during the lifetime, there are none in the world of the consciousness. In other words, I will say that it just moves to say that I think. Furthermore, it is just handed down to a partner to have thought. The life of all of us shares what one interiority. And the material is to say that it was actually consciousness. There are all things in your heart, and, also, you are existence to live in a heart of all life. When all of this space watches it with eyes, it is seen like the outside world, but is to say that the world to be actually seen outside is your interiority. The relativity disappears in here, and this space consists based on &quot;universal truth to certainly say to call God&quot;. \r<br>\r<br> Near future to read from revelation and illuminati card of God of days, and to untie it in Japan\r<br> April, 2020 xx day The United States bombs North Korea. North Korea adds nuclear attack to a big city of Japan and a U.S. base as the retaliation. Japan swats it to a bog of the war, and they are dropped by a plot of the United States. There are China, Russia after North Korea and becomes the fight with Japan, American allied powers and drags the world into World War 3.\r<br> x moon xx Japan and the United States country attacks it in Japan with the Allied Forces in 2021\r<br> World War 3 begins in 2021 on xx moon xx day\r<br> Mount Fuji erupts very much on xx day in October, 2023. Major earthquakes occur in a row in all parts of the world. \r<br> An asteroid collides on the earth on xx moon xx day in 2023, and the earth becomes muddy sea \r<br> The world (heaven) of the Maitreya is built on xx moon xx day in 2024\r<br>\r<br> Final note\r<br> The human being denies violence and war, but is it not violence and killing each other I kill a cow pig, and to eat meat? I conquer the world in the life of the hell of the cruel survival of the fittest and am useless even if only oneself is going to be saved. Because a killed animal retaliates for a human being, cancer occurs. The meat which I ate becomes the blood, and a vindictive spirit dwells in a cell when blood does formation to a cell. A human being is cruel, and a fornication, a falsehood, committing theft, the habit of the evil deed of the luxury are not stopped. Eating meat is indirect killing. Why is God that existence of the evil is permitted? It lets you compensate for a human crime by the devil. A disaster, an epidemic, the war damage are the wrath of Heaven. Because a Japanese savior buys the crime of the world people, it is sacrificed. I fall in the trees and plants in spite of the pains then even if I writhe with a hell if it is just and changes the heart and does not straighten an act to measure up to hearts of God. Mason finally leads the world to the World War 3. it is started with nuclear attack to Japan as a pilot light.

A stupid scholar all overturned this truth and built it to a convenient system of Mason. Thus, the people believe the trickery of the devil than words of God. What is called brainwashing without expressing brainwashing in this? Darwin&#39;s evolutionary theory, the Copernican theory of Galileo, the theory of relativity, quantum mechanics, mathematics, medicine, the genetic engineering (the gene is the soul of language as for the gene a tool) of Einstein are all errors. A ghost, a UFO (as for the alien a lie), supernatural power, a miracle, telepathy of God, the moment movement to be said to be the occult are rather true. A thing and a ghost (God) exist in the world, and space is active by spiritual power (conception) of God. As for God, all things were created by the soul of language. It is clear if I read the Bible. Because the present scholar mixes the logic thoroughly in human wisdom, it cannot arrive at the truth. It is intuitive power to be important. Why does a child seem to be? The thing which cannot answer this is a mistake. Our common sense is more right than a stupid scholar. The creation of God comes loose only by a fate. Everything becomes the material by a conception of God (person).<br><br>I cannot prove 1+1 = 2 in a numerical formula. I can prove only a physical phenomenon to say that it is in two apples when I match another one apple with one apple. An apple becomes extinct suddenly and does not become 1+1 = 2 like an operation of the other self if a number is quality to increase. It is not 0+1 \u2260 1. As 0 (nothing) is not quality, you must not handle it for a number. Because quality is different even if I match a mandarin orange with an apple, there is not a meaning of the addition. Because it does not exist other than God when I define God as existence (integer), no (0) does not exist.<br><br>If 0 exists by a definition of the mathematics, 0 of the infinity must exist. However, infinite space is infinite (\u221e) and does not exist either. In other words, because the mathematics defines 0, negative number, imaginary number, \u221e which do not exist, it is an error and is a fiction. Therefore it is an error because a zeta function, the numerical formula of the second oiler product deal with this infinity. That it becomes sum of series \u03a3 = 1+2+3+ ... = - 1/12 of the natural number, or the product of all prime numbers is 4\u03c0^2. It turns out that it is an error if I think for common sense. It is limited, and the mathematician seems to get a wrong this, but uses the sophism when I calculate this endlessly if right. This is mistake definition of 0or \u221e and is the evidence that mathematics gets a wrong. It is definition f&#39;(x) = limh of the differential calculus that must not divide it by 0 \u2192 0 {the same as it being 0 that says that I bring h close to 0 without a limit, and dividing it by a numerical formula of f(x+h)-f(x)}/h. I divide it by 0. The mathematics is trickery not study in this way.<br><br>It was done that Einstein who hit the contradiction of the uncertainness theory that became the quantum-mechanical basics returned by contradiction of own theory of relativity and defeated it. When Mitsuko of the one of the boxes of a theory, the light jumps out of a shutter, a spring shrinks, and a box lightens, and true time becomes uncertain because time advances if mass by the theory of relativity lightens. Therefore I concluded that an uncertain theory was right. The principle of constancy of light velocity of Einstein is an error, and the special theory of relativity from it is a mistake, too. Thus, the quantum mechanics is blague.<br><br>I find out a lie of Einstein<br>UFOA took off in speed of light C from 0 spots to the right direction, and UFOB took off at the same time in speed of light C from 0 spots to the left direction. In A, B arrived at the point of Ckm from 0 spots to the left at the point of Ckm from 0 spots to the right one second later. The distance of the meantime is 2Ckm. The speed to see UFOB becomes double speed of light C from UFOA. This is right than it is measured in a speedometer. The principle of constancy of light velocity is an error. In other words, the theory of relativity is a lie. I know it even if I think about such a thing for common sense. A law of the addition of the speed is why and is applicable to a material, and is it not applicable to light? Naturally it is applicable to light. Time stops when I exercise in speed of light, and mass becomes infinite. Why is so; cannot examine it. In other words, such a thing is a lie.<br><br>Message of the spiritual world of Einstein <br>When oneself saw a scene of heaven through a tunnel of the light in the meantime, the person who experienced suspended animation well is you after the revival. The moving speed of the soul does not receive gravitational restraint anymore, and, as for the law of the speed of light immutability that I discovered during the lifetime, there are none in the world of the consciousness. In other words, I will say that it just moves to say that I think. Furthermore, it is just handed down to a partner to have thought. The life of all of us shares what one interiority. And the material is to say that it was actually consciousness. There are all things in your heart, and, also, you are existence to live in a heart of all life. When all of this space watches it with eyes, it is seen like the outside world, but is to say that the world to be actually seen outside is your interiority. The relativity disappears in here, and this space consists based on &quot;universal truth to certainly say to call God&quot;. <br><br>The scientists equal to my younger student arrive at an outbreak point of the space named the BIC barn from my formula and seem to argue variously, but, as for it, do not have a meaning too much. This is because it is in one, and an infinite opening and all properties that a phase contradicts it at all called at the infinite end and the eternity exist in this space. In other words, it includes the whole (God) at the same time that it is 1, and it is a religious concept to say that the whole is 1 (God) at the same time.<br><br>\u203bLet&#39;s prove that the Copernican theory of Galileo is a lie<br>I should be able to observe movement to rotate of the earth from a flying airplane, but seem to hardly move. The atmosphere and the airplane are at one with the earth and do not rotate. Because the wind blows from all directions of north, south, east and west, the atmosphere is not restricted on the earth. Because freedom can navigate the airplane in the atmosphere, I am not restricted by the atmosphere. The botfly flew lightly when I observed the state that threw a botfly in the airplane which was surely flying, and flew without being affected by the inertial force that the weight of the botfly by the speed of the airplane brought about. This is evidence to say that I do not produce the inertial force in the airplane shut in. In other words, mind (even if I make a vacuum like) of the space before and after the horsefly denies an inertial force. An air pocket after the object exercises creates the inertial forces. Therefore an inertial force acts forward if an inertial force acts after the airplane and slows down suddenly. However, the atmosphere on the earth flows in the state that is not pasted on the earth freely. Therefore the driving force of the airplane damps by just that much if an airplane navigates it against the inertial force (by the centrifugal force) to the east direction by the rotation of the earth to the west direction. As for the inertial force that the rotation of the earth of 1,700km per an hour produces, it is thought about with a considerably big thing enough an airplane not being able to move.<br>The speed of the rotation of the earth of the neighborhood of equator is 1,700km per an hour. If the ground moves at this speed when an airplane lands, the airplane is completely demolished by the shock. The reason why it is not completely demolished is that the earth does not rotate.<br>The ball draws a righthander and can bend into the partner on a merry-go-round of rotating it anticlockwise when I pass a ball. If shoot a mark, can bend with a rifle in the same way; and there is not the thing equal to the mark.<br><br>All the origins of the scientific theory are random, and a bottom is broken. For example, in the theory of elementary particles, an electron joins atoms together and becomes the molecules. A thing joining a proton and a neutron together is a mesotron, and three quarks connect the proton, and there is it. An electron and a positron (antimatter) occur from a photon. An elementary particle to tie the elementary particle to whenever a new elementary particle is discovered is necessary and loses the relations with an elementary particle and the elementary particle more and more. Though a proton and the neutron are the same mass, why does a difference occur in having electric charge or not? The science has no answer with it in these questions. An electron is a material so that I think, and the positron is not a material in the hole of the material loss that the circumference was surrounded by in the soul children. In other words, the antimatter is an illusion. The scholar is going to examine it logically and loses sight of the truth. The structure of built nature of God is simpler, but is the thing which it is hard to understand in the human wisdom. A photon seems to have a particle and the two characteristics of the wave, but, in fact, the light has the property of the wave in the soul children.", "comment_date": "2021-09-25T06:51:01Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Jere", "comment_text": "I honestly didn&#39;t understand anything, but i feel more intelligent", "comment_date": "2021-09-25T03:43:39Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Walter Wei\u00df", "comment_text": "Isnt the brightness of lighthouse A and B together with the third 0.62 or can someone explain why ist is 0.63 <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-o3eB9sfls&amp;t=9m14s\">9:14</a>", "comment_date": "2021-09-24T07:19:03Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Connoisseur Dumbass", "comment_text": "What i got from this is that if u keep doing the light house thing you are gonna get a rad looking logo", "comment_date": "2021-09-23T06:05:25Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Jainam Mehta", "comment_text": "procrastinating on math homework with this", "comment_date": "2021-09-22T00:10:58Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "\u043c\u0438\u0445\u0430\u0438\u043b \u043f\u0435\u0442\u0440\u043e\u0432\u0438\u0447", "comment_text": "Mathematicans is moron, Pi must not to determine exactly, Pi is impossible to determine becouse a circle with constant radius - is fake", "comment_date": "2021-09-20T12:06:11Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "una park", "comment_text": "\uac10\uc0ac\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "comment_date": "2021-09-20T09:38:25Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "una park", "comment_text": "\uc6b0\uc655 \uc7ac\ubc0c\ub2e4", "comment_date": "2021-09-20T09:37:40Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "MsAfrocookie", "comment_text": "\u039f\u03b9 \u03b1\u03bb\u03b3\u03cc\u03c1\u03b9\u03b8\u03bc\u03bf\u03b9 \u03c0\u03bf\u03c5 \u03c4\u03c1\u03bf\u03c6\u03bf\u03b4\u03bf\u03c4\u03bf\u03cd\u03bd \u03c4\u03bf \u03bc\u03c5\u03b1\u03bb\u03cc \u03c3\u03bf\u03c5, \u03c3\u03c5\u03b3\u03ba\u03b1\u03b8\u03bf\u03c1\u03af\u03b6\u03bf\u03c5\u03bd \u03b1\u03c5\u03c4\u03cc \u03c0\u03bf\u03c5 \u03b5\u03af\u03c3\u03b1\u03b9.", "comment_date": "2021-09-19T07:37:14Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Brahvim", "comment_text": "...and you call this Geometric Progression?<br><br>School skipped that part of the APs and GPs chapter :|", "comment_date": "2021-09-18T17:57:44Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "V\u0169 B\u00f9i v\u0103n phong", "comment_text": "Asi&#39;m", "comment_date": "2021-09-18T09:01:19Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "V\u0169 B\u00f9i v\u0103n phong", "comment_text": "Hoara10^n Quy nh\u1ee9t th\u1ec3 gi\u1edbi", "comment_date": "2021-09-18T09:00:54Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "V\u0169 B\u00f9i v\u0103n phong", "comment_text": "DongvAian", "comment_date": "2021-09-18T08:54:15Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "V\u0169 B\u00f9i v\u0103n phong", "comment_text": "\u00d76\u00d710^limnmu0,5", "comment_date": "2021-09-18T08:54:00Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "no comment", "comment_text": "I&#39;m loving this channel", "comment_date": "2021-09-18T03:51:44Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "no comment", "comment_text": "Understanding very slowly", "comment_date": "2021-09-18T03:44:27Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Helloworld", "comment_text": "Since the number of lighthouses on an infinitely large circle is 2^aleph0(Because there are 2^n lighthouses in the distance that we zoomed in n times n.)<br>, it can be said that the number of lighthouses &gt; the number of natural lighthouses, right?", "comment_date": "2021-09-17T11:45:30Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "\u30af\u30de\u30fc\u30eb\u738b\u5b50", "comment_text": "just to suffer", "comment_date": "2021-09-17T10:50:45Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Teebro Prokash", "comment_text": "This should be in &#39;Proofs from the book&#39;!", "comment_date": "2021-09-17T05:25:47Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Dmitry Berdnikov", "comment_text": "2D problem became 1D problem all of the sudden.", "comment_date": "2021-09-17T03:18:29Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Daniele Sgaravato", "comment_text": "You brightened my day, thank you so much", "comment_date": "2021-09-14T16:00:15Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Lidor Shimoni", "comment_text": "The homothethy of infinity", "comment_date": "2021-09-13T22:10:32Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "do trinh", "comment_text": "<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-o3eB9sfls&amp;t=7m35s\">7:35</a> - \u201cI wish I was high on potenuse\u201d - Troy Morrison", "comment_date": "2021-09-13T20:46:55Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "CRWE EWRC", "comment_text": "I wish more math teachers follow in your footsteps.<br>The fact that you actually inspire your students by trying to show off the true beauty of mathematics is far more helpful and amazing than just letting students do problems.<br>Most of my classmates, although smart, only sought to do math in order to past entrance exams for university.

So the length of the circle represented in degrees is an angle of 6\u00d760\u00ba = 360\u00ba <br>If you use degree to calculate values of objects in circular shapes,  you can come up with accurate calculattions , but not pi<br>The reason why every circle or every object in circular shapes akways abides by this rule is that all curves including circles come of or are  formed by straight lines <br>Cir =6R =3d  <br>All what you need to have to prove that rule is to get some objects in circular shapes of different sizes, a pen and a piece of paper to draw a straight line along which yiu will roll the objects without sliding any of them <br>Ex: if yoh have a straight line of which the length is 21 or 25 m or wha<br>tever value it might be, you can nake it become a circle  and the length of the circle is obviously 21 m.

If you consider a to be the base, then Area\u00b2 = a\u00b2 * b\u00b2 / 4, but if you choose c as your base, the height of the triangle is h, so Area\u00b2 = c\u00b2 * h\u00b2 / 4.

It seems to me that lighthouses A and B should interact with my eye in a foreshortened manner due to the angle from the direction the eye is facing. In the video the screen is reshaped so that lighthouse 1 interacts with the screen via two fore shortened screens. Why should that be? If light house A and B get to interact with their share of the screen at right angles hoe do you account for the fact that A and B not only &quot;see&quot; a bigger screen (combined) but also are farther away? It seems to me that the increased distance to A and B would not be enough to cut their combined intensity to 1 unit.

I think the explanation is that the brightness at the origin is not related simply to the amount of light falling on the small line segments near the origin. Instead the angle at which the light hits the line segment is also important, with, for the same total amount of light hitting the segment, the brightness seen by an observer at the origin being larger when it hits at a shallow angle.

But 1) how do you prove that each of those angles covered by each of the lighthouses A and B equal to the original brightness from a lighthouse at the distance h and 2) where do you use the fact the all 3 lighthouses emit the same amount of light?", "comment_date": "2020-03-08T12:55:57Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Javier Merinero", "comment_text": "El punto fundamental de la equivalencia entre un faro a una distancia y los infinitos faros equidistantes hacia ambos lados, est\u00e1 en la equivalencia entre un faro en un determinado punto y los situados en las intersecciones de la recta perpendicular con los ejes coordenados.", "comment_date": "2020-03-08T08:52:33Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Javier Merinero", "comment_text": "Este canal es un aut\u00e9ntico delicatessen", "comment_date": "2020-03-08T08:47:58Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "munagala prabhakar", "comment_text": "Excellent video.", "comment_date": "2020-03-08T08:14:05Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Paul Gildan", "comment_text": "An interesting footnote to this is that the ratio on the left side of the equation equals that of the volume of a sphere to its circumference cubed.

The foundations of Maths seem to require the concepts of zero and infinity (and the right angle) in order to understand the finite world of 1, 2, 3, .... Alternatively, Maths simply requires the concept of a circle, which has a straight diameter and a curved circumference both starting at one point (A) and both reaching the other (B), and back again.<br><br>If one takes the curve of the half circumference of the circle to go from A to B (the diameter being AB), one is not taking a curve but a straight line that is perpendicular to the direction of the line AB.  It is curious how this perpendicular straight line that passes through A becomes the curve of a circle, bending towards B through infinitely short straight lines that turn (while keeping straight) towards B.<br><br>On the other hand, if one goes directly from A towards B (as if in a straight line), one is actually taking an extreme curve that points one in the direction of B from A. <br><br>An extreme curve (i.e. a straight line) is formed as follows: First assume that the circle has an infinite diameter (A on the one end and passing through B to infinity), in which case one will never reach B, as circle with infinite diameter becomes a straight line passing through A perpendicular to the line AB (in other words, the circle is transformed from two dimensions into one). But as one decreases that infinite diameter into a finite amount, the circle becomes a two dimensional object, and the curve that passes through A eventually reaches B (when the diameter is AB). At first, this curve is very gradual, and as one decreases the diameter, the curve becomes steeper and steeper, pointing one closer and closer in the direction from A directly towards B. As the diameter of the circle approaches zero, the circle loses both dimensions (as it becomes a point at A), and the curve of its circumference becomes so extreme that it points one directly in the direction of B.  That curve was, in the first place, a series of infinitely short straight-lines, which started perpendicular to the line AB, and now is a circle with an infinitely small diameter, but pointing in the direction to AB. <br><br>Thus straight lines can turn in a circle (and return to the origin), and a circle can point in a direction from one point to another! The curve of this (pointing) circle (with infinitely small diameter) is in fact the derivative: it gives the direction of the movement without directly joining two points on that path. Effectively, the straight line of the curve that one followed perpendicular to AB has been turned 90 degrees so that it now points from A to B.<br><br>The path of A to B is thus to be conceived as both a straight line (a determined path) joining A and B and equivalently as only a direction centred at A that points to B, but does not connect A and B (no determined path). To reach B, one must move in the direction of the path with a certain hope and expectation that B will be reached (because there is determined no line or curve joining the two points, only a point at one&#39;s location A pointing towards B). <br><br>Thus the path from A to B is an extreme curve of infinitely small circles (at each point between A and B) which do not join any of the points on the path, but are centred at A and at each point on the path (at every new A approaching B), and point in the direction of B.<br><br>ANOTHER IMPLICATION OF CIRCLES: INFINITE SUM OF RATIONALS = IRRATIONAL  <br>It would seem that irrational numbers are the infinite sum of rational numbers, and vice versa. One cannot multiple two rational numbers and get an irrational number, yet an irrational number (which is necessary to conceive of a circle) is the infinite sum of rational numbers, and vice versa. Infinity and zero (the infinitely small) have the ability to equate rational and irrational numbers. That is how circles are conceived.<br><br>If the diameter (from point A to B) is rational (e.g. 2), then half-circumference (from A to B) will be irrational (i.e. pi), and if the half-circumference is rational (e.g. 1), then the diameter is irrational (i.e. 1/pi). Both rational and irrational concepts guide one from any point A to any point B, either following a curve or a straight line making use of the concepts of infinity and zero (infinitely small).<br><br>Because physical reality seems to have quantum levels for space-time-energy (as a kind of pixelated reality), thus the concepts of infinity and zero are beyond this reality (though perceived by the mind), and the nearest real quantum to both is where physical reality appears to end and to begin, when one traverses the real distance A to B.", "comment_date": "2018-12-18T17:06:53Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Aya Tadlaoui", "comment_text": "Your videos make my day \u2764\ufe0f\ufe0f", "comment_date": "2018-12-18T10:07:34Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "wrb666", "comment_text": "beautiful", "comment_date": "2018-12-17T06:46:58Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Luis Rodr\u00edguez", "comment_text": "Excelente", "comment_date": "2018-12-17T02:39:45Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "AdamFra", "comment_text": "Brilliant art incoming if you&#39;re at <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-o3eB9sfls&amp;t=12m00s\">12:00</a>.", "comment_date": "2018-12-16T16:56:34Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "\u05d0\u05d9\u05ea\u05d9 \u05e1\u05de\u05d5\u05d0\u05dc\u05d5\u05d1", "comment_text": "I actually calculated it in a different way... but many time i have been looking for a reasonable explaination", "comment_date": "2018-12-16T15:29:16Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Maria Cec\u00edlia", "comment_text": "&quot;I&#39;m so tired of studying, guess I&#39;ll just watch some funny videos on youtube&quot;<br>Me 30 seconds later:", "comment_date": "2018-12-15T22:17:30Z", "likes_count": 1372}, {"comment_by": "H\u1ea1nh Nguy\u1ec5n", "comment_text": "great!!", "comment_date": "2018-12-14T14:49:20Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Sam Gao", "comment_text": "This intuitive solution to the Bazel problem is impressive, but you are missing one crucial point: you have to prove that infinite series involved in the process can be added or subtracted interchangably (i.e. by showing it converges absolutely), otherwise you can not extract 1/4 from the original series and do the division.", "comment_date": "2018-12-14T09:23:32Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Nick O", "comment_text": "@3Blue1Brown What software do you use to animate this?", "comment_date": "2018-12-13T17:50:57Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Amazing Little Kuin", "comment_text": "3Blue1Red?", "comment_date": "2018-12-13T16:51:29Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Emilio P.R.", "comment_text": "\ud83d\udc4f\ud83d\udc4f\ud83d\udc4f\ud83d\udc4f\ud83d\udc4f\ud83d\udc4f\ud83d\udc4f\ud83d\udc4f\ud83d\udc4f\ud83d\udc4f\ud83d\udc4f\ud83d\udc4f\ud83d\udc4f\ud83d\udc4f\ud83d\udc4f", "comment_date": "2018-12-13T15:52:18Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "John Reasoner", "comment_text": "Are inverse squares in 3 dimensional spaces analogous to reciprocals in 2 dimensional ones?", "comment_date": "2018-12-13T03:23:26Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "CM21", "comment_text": "dangit another homework!", "comment_date": "2018-12-12T13:57:18Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Fif0l", "comment_text": "This is the best mathematical channel I&#39;ve seen.", "comment_date": "2018-12-12T04:31:09Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "WalderSasytZ", "comment_text": "\u041d\u0438\u0445\u0443\u044f \u043d\u0435 \u043f\u043e\u043d\u044f\u043b, \u043d\u043e \u043e\u0447\u0435\u043d\u044c \u0438\u043d\u0442\u0435\u0440\u0435\u0441\u043d\u043e!", "comment_date": "2018-12-11T15:55:06Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Paolo M\u00e9niz", "comment_text": "Estupenda demostraci\u00f3n", "comment_date": "2018-12-10T22:49:53Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "XiKLeR", "comment_text": "Amazing", "comment_date": "2018-12-10T09:32:01Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "39rama", "comment_text": "Brilliant!!

I figured out my own geometric proof of Euler&#39;s Rotation Theorem, for which I couldn&#39;t understand any of the proofs I found online - I must post it someplace (hopefully there is no error in it!).<br>I also have to say this is a very fine explanation, though some details I still have to think through, I still recognize from your explanation the elegance of this proof. The one tricky part though I think will be the limiting case for the similar triangles you mentioned. I worked out the ratio of the cosines of these angles is :-<br>(1 - k) sqroot ( ( (ksin A)^2 + (cos A) ^2 ) / ( (ksinA)^2 + ((1 - k)cosA)^2 ) )<br>where k is the ratio of the smaller triangle to the larger, and A is the angle of the hypotenuse to the horizontal. This tends to 1 as k tends to 0, as claimed.<br>However the problem is light intensity depends on SOLID angle, not on planar angle - so something more needs to be said here. One of the things I dislike about sketchy arguments is details are glossed over, so we could be hiding absurdities - like every derivative is always 1 - BECAUSE, Delta x approx equals 0, Delta y approx equals 0 - thus Delta x approx equals Delta y - HENCE Delta y / Delta x approx equals 1 - AND in the limit as Delta x tends to 0, it thus tends to 1, HENCE etc. Yes its nice to try and make it more accessible - but don&#39;t forget the basics !<br>An infinite radius circle is like an infinite straight line because it has ZERO curvature. Its a tricky concept - as we think the circle must come back on itself. But if the curvature has fallen to zero it never does that !<br>To me this is a heuristic proof, not a rigorous mathematical proof - though it is truly excellent, and very cleverly conceived.", "comment_date": "2018-08-04T00:46:00Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "\u70cf\u9f8d", "comment_text": "awesome!", "comment_date": "2018-08-03T08:52:53Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Kuldip Gohil", "comment_text": "Sorry not got satisfaction solution need maths solution", "comment_date": "2018-08-03T08:26:31Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "medexamtoolsdotcom", "comment_text": "Pac man at <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-o3eB9sfls&amp;t=13m18s\">13:18</a>.

Because the lighthouses will always have the same spacing, every lighthouse that gets split into a pair with the same combined brightness will exactly intersect its pair while rolling around. I think this fits well with the idea of splitting the lighthouses into two new ones if you can imagine a lighthouse on an inner circle &quot;depositing&quot; a copy of itself where it contacts the outer circle and later depositing another copy on the opposite side of the circle. The new set of lighthouses rolls around another circle doing the same thing, ad infinitum.

Two thoughts: first, it\u2019s helpful to note that the fact that it\u2019s a right angle subtended by a diameter from a point on the circle is just a special case of the inscribed angle theorem where the central angle is 180 degrees. It\u2019s a nice way to cover both theorems with the same underlying fact.<br><br>Second, since the video is taking a physics perspective with the light analogy, I thought I\u2019d point out a physical proof to understand the theorem you mentioned at <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-o3eB9sfls&amp;t=8m00s\">8:00</a>. Notice that the area of the slender triangles is half the cross product of the short \u201cscreen\u201d vector and the distance between the screen and lighthouse. So the amount of light hitting the screen can be thought of as a torque, where the displacement between the screen and lighthouse is the radius, and the screen vector is the force. Then you can use the physical concept of calculating torques using the \u201cmoment arm\u201d technique (the torque remains constant no matter at which point along the perpendicular the force is applied), which turns out to be the same as what we want to prove here.

It shouldn&#39;t surprise anyone  (but it does!) that the radius &#39;walks&#39; the circumference of the circle EXACTLY 6 times.  The types of triangles are all found by the relation of radii and chords in a circle.   As shown, the diameter of any circle will be the hypotenuse of any and all right triangles, with the center point as the midpoint on the hypotenuse.   Iscosceles triangles have the center point as the angle formed by the two radii or &#39;equal sides&#39; and the scalene triangle is any random chords which do not intersect the center point of the circle. <br><br>It is quite easy to show that number patterns are intrinsically following the geometry of the circle, but to this day, no one understands this.

The inverse pythagorean theorem doesn&#39;t imply that, because although the brightness per unit area is 1/r^2, given the fixed screen area, one needs to multiply by the cosine of the angle between the screen normal and position vector of the lighthouse to get the brightness incident on the screen!<br><br>Now, why did this confuse me? Because the demonstration at <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-o3eB9sfls&amp;t=8m00s\">8:00</a> (which I checked using some geometry) said that the angle subtended by the screen from lighthouse H equals the sum of angles suspended from lighthouse A and B. Furthermore, the video makes you think that angle subtended == brightness on screen (at least infinitesimaly). This is true! But only in 2D and when brightness decreases like 1/r. In, 3D, with brightness decreasing like 1/r^2, it is the subtended <b>solid angle</b> that matters, and in this same setup, but extended to 3D, the solid angle subtended by the fixed screen at lighthouse H is not the same as the sum of solid angles subtended at lighthouses A and B!<br><br>In summary, I think the demonstration at <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-o3eB9sfls&amp;t=8m00s\">8:00</a>, inspired by the thing said at <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-o3eB9sfls&amp;t=6m10s\">6:10</a>, actually makes things more confusing, because it is not true that the Inverse Pythagorean theorem is equivalent to the thing said at <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-o3eB9sfls&amp;t=6m10s\">6:10</a>, when taken as a statement in 3D.
