Euler&#39;s father and Johann had both roomed in Jakob&#39;s house in Basel when the father and Johann were both students at the University of Basel when Jakob taught.  -- Daniel is the Bernoulli of &quot;Bernoulli&#39;s Principle&quot; in fluid flow). He was studying it in connection with not the Heat Equation, but the Wave Equation as a model for a plucked string (like a guitar string). He proposed in a letter to Euler that any realistic initial configuration could be written as a sum of sine waves. Euler replied both showing how the coefficients of the sine terms could be calculated, but also criticizing the concept. He noted that a simple initial configuration would be pulling the string out at the middle, giving the string (endpoints fixed) a v-shape. That shape is not differentiable at the vertex, but all sine functions used in the proposed sum are differentiable everywhere. So, he stated, the idea could not work in the generality that Daniel suggested. The idea was out. When Fourier first presented his results in a paper of heat propagation to a Paris committee in 1807, the paper was rejected. On of the committee members, Joseph Lagrange (a prot\u00e9g\u00e9 of the now-dead Euler) specifically criticized the notion that any function could be represented by Fourier&#39;s trigonometric series.", "comment_date": "2022-08-12T23:33:04Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "oistoist ee", "comment_text": "just imagine... everyone having your knowledge in maths.... how more advanced we would be", "comment_date": "2022-08-10T21:56:05Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "ok", "comment_text": "ok", "comment_date": "2022-08-09T12:58:28Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "David Tan", "comment_text": "I&#39;m no mathematician, but may I say there&#39;s something really bizzare and abstruse about this.

I think you should have fixed the middle of the image to that larger concentric circle, so that the e^(it) lies the same distance away from the unit circle at all degrees around the unit circle. Because of the irregularity of the shapes of the letters within the square image that I feel like you imported\u2026 the distance will never be the exact same actually if you just use a concentric circle. However, there does exist a shape that the image could trace to keep the distance between the closest point on the letters e^(it) and the unit circle constant.

Let us suppose there is a  vector r in a circle whose tail is at the origin and  the head of the vector is at a point p and making an angle theta w.r.t to the horizontal x axis. This rotating action can be simply achieved by changing the angle theta and the vector moves around the circle.   Why are we going for a complex exponential here? I understand that the complex exponential also does the same thing and so would any vector r ( as mentioned above).  Further , the horizontal component of the vector r, along the x axis is r*cos(theta) and the vertical component of the vector r is r*sin( theta).  If you add these , you should get to the head of the vector r.  Why would I need to introduce the complex number &quot;i&quot; here , I,e  r*cos(theta) + i*r*sin(theta)?  I am unable to understand the use of a complex number here.", "comment_date": "2020-06-02T18:06:07Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "francesco piazza", "comment_text": "Fantastic video!", "comment_date": "2020-06-01T09:27:30Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Caterina Semenova", "comment_text": "I am crying how beautiful it is", "comment_date": "2020-06-01T08:12:11Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Toni Mart\u00ednez", "comment_text": "Impresive...!!", "comment_date": "2020-05-30T11:49:12Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Santiago G", "comment_text": "Now that was some beautiful abstract Fourier <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r6sGWTCMz2k&amp;t=21m55s\">21:55</a>", "comment_date": "2020-05-30T07:33:05Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Min Thant Htoo", "comment_text": "OMG!

But, essentially, I&#39;ll preface it with this: I make music, so I know about the fourier series in terms of music and harmonics, and, more specifically, for my question, squarewaves as the sound for music (generally electronic music). Now, I know that the standard squarewave is an approximation made from all the odd valued frequencies with amplitudes at one over that frequency value (to put it in, probably, mathematically incorrect terms). But this waveform that this produces contains a whole lot of wobbliness, especially at the sides of the square, where there are notable spikes. This probably isn&#39;t a problem in most applications of the fourier series, but with music, that inaccuracy and those sharp spikes are audible. I&#39;ve done some experimenting and found that the frequencies can be added together with a different amplitude shift, and it produces what looks like a much better approximation of a square wave, albeit on that approaches a true square wave probably more slowly, I think.<br><br>So, while you show a typical squarewave here, and with the program I used, it would be this: <br><a href=\"https://i.imgur.com/yvkhiAB.png\">https://i.imgur.com/yvkhiAB.png</a><br><br>Here&#39;s what I came up with (animated): <a href=\"https://i.imgur.com/qm92B0C.gif\">https://i.imgur.com/qm92B0C.gif</a><br><br>The basic idea (although this program isn&#39;t prefect, so I had to estimate) is that the slope of the waveform only changes from increasing to decreasing, or vice versa, at the peaks and troughs, and nowhere else, and also the amplitudes of each frequency, given that constraint, are at their maximum possible value (&#39;cause otherwise, you&#39;d get something closer to a regular sine wave, obviously). And I was able to listen to this waveform and compare it to the standard squarewave, and this one sounds much nicer. It isn&#39;t anywhere near as harsh or buzzing. But I guess, what I want to know is what have I stumbled upon, and is there some mathematics behind it that&#39;s interesting, and how does this process of approximating a squarewave work, and is there a formula for this? Basically, I&#39;m curious as to why we don&#39;t use this method of approximation instead, because it looks like it is a much better method of approximation (even though, I suppose the standard method is probably easier, and, on average, despite being so wavy, approximates it more quickly). Anyway. This has been on my mind for probably over a year now. I&#39;d be grateful and intrigued to learn anything about what I stumbled upon here.<br><br>Also, would whatever mathematics is behind this concept help to trace more aesthetically pleasing images with less wobbly lines?", "comment_date": "2019-07-01T13:46:57Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "MegaPhester", "comment_text": "COOL.

Not because you need to increase the quality of your content (definitely not the case), but because your material is reaching the level of becoming an international reference for dissemination of undergraduate and graduate-level mathematics.<br><br>Your material makes me remember of Ascher Shapiro&#39;s 1961 fluid mechanics series (National Committee for Fluid Mechanics Films [<a href=\"http://web.mit.edu/hml/ncfmf.html])\">http://web.mit.edu/hml/ncfmf.html])</a>. Back then obviously the animations were crude due to the technology available, but the way complex fluid mechanics concepts were taught is so beautifully intuitive that it keeps on having a great impact even today, more than 60 years later. It is actually used as graduate course material for many institutions (including the one I&#39;m a graduate student right now). Your material already supersedes the quality of Shapiro&#39;s work both in technological refinement and level of insight provided, at least in my opinion.<br><br>I&#39;m not sure how ambitious you are about this project, Grant, but you should definitely step up from the Youtube &quot;every-man-for-himself&quot; fight against &quot;the Algorithm&quot; to something actually professional that can support your work long-term and be of greater impact. You don&#39;t need to stop publishing on Youtube, but having a funding source will definitely afford you a few fellow content producers so you can focus on the aspects that really make the content stand out (i.e., the story, the insight, the animation standard) and free some of your time from the details (making the animation programs work, rendering/editing, etc). I&#39;m absolutely sure that your content to-do list increases at a faster pace than you can animate it right now and having people to work with you would increase your impact even more.
