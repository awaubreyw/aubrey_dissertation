Prohibiting it may restrict students from using a way that they are more familiar with.<br>2. It may make it hard for students to communicate with teachers (as the teachers might not be familiar with all the most recent tricks)..

Students may forget the formula.<br><br>For 3, it is clear that calculating the eigenvalues of a 2 by 2 matrix is a toy problem that illustrates all the ideas of calculating the eigenvalues of a 3 by 3 (or larger sized) matrix: calculate characteristic polynomial using the determinant, find the roots, those are the eigenvalues.<br>Students who just learn a quick trick might not really be learning how to calculate eigenvalues in general. This is especially so for classes that are using linear algebra only as a tool (e.g. an intro to Differential Equations class) that only have students calculate eigenvalues for 2 by 2 matrices to save their sanity and to not waste too much time on testing linear algebra techniques in a course which focuses on different ideas.<br>That said, quick tricks are nice. They do teach a similar trick in linear algebra courses, though not as concise.<br><br>4 is actually relevant. I have taught a class with the formula for the quasiperiod of an underdamped oscillator, which I provided briefly in class. I also derived it for each example when I needed it, however a number of students did not derive the formula on the exam and just tried to remember the formula. A number of which did so incorrectly.<br>This is related to how we test student&#39;s knowledge.
