Aside your brilliant videos you have also brought the community closer together, unfolding the huge potential of all math creators on YouTube and other platforms. Thanks to you I can already see a new golden age for Mathematics, something that would have taken decades longer without your ambitions.<br>You have also motivated lots of people to also share their contribution to Mathematics, making them feel more involved in research and also making us feel like scientists ourselves. I might consider making some YouTube videos about Math as well thanks to you :)<br><br>Do not ever stop making these videos and I also ask you to make the competition an annual (or maybe even every 4 months) event to continue unfolding the entire potential of our brilliance.<br><br>Thank you 3blue1brown for all of your contributions!<br><br>(also, sorry for my bad english)", "comment_date": "2021-10-23T20:53:23Z", "likes_count": 29}, {"comment_by": "Agamemnon", "comment_text": "Heh, I recognize a lot of the entries from the thumbnails.
