If you omit the second term, then 1/(1-p) is actually finding the solution to S = 1 + p + p^2 + ... + p^{n-1} + p^{n}/(1-p). For p &lt; 1, 1/(1-p) = (1-p^n)/(1-p) in the limit, but this isn&#39;t the case for p &gt; 1. In the case of p = 2, this sum evaluates to -1, because the p^{n}/(1-p) term evaluates to -2^n, meaning you subtract 2^n from the sum of terms up to 2^{n-1}. Your own diagram shows that 2^n is is always 1 greater than this value, so this makes sense. The same holds true for Grandi&#39;s series. Evaluating the last term at p = -1 gives you either 1/2 or -1/2 depending on n. When the sum is zero, this final term evaluates to 1/2. When the sum is 1, it evaluates to -1/2. This means that the final term forces the result to always be 1/2, since the sum will always be either 0 + 1/2, or 1 - 1/2. You could construct an &quot;opposite&quot; Grandi&#39;s series as well, which will always evaluate to -1/2 using the same principle, and it also works for the series S_a = 1 - 2 + 3 - 4 + ..., since you end up with 2S_a = Grandi&#39;s series; accounting for the final term always gives you 1/4.<br><br>It seems to me that the result of 1/(1-p) is valid for any p != 1, but isn&#39;t reflective of the notation on the left hand side of the equation when p &gt; 1.

Well our formula would pretty much be the entire same 0,5(3^(n+1)-0,5), see the -0,5 popping up now? For 4 we would see -1/3 and I think you see the relation. When we use the 1/1-p formula which is used to calculate these, we would become very strange answers just like the -1 you just came across. However this &#39;limit&#39; is our factorization of the formula (1/(1-x))(-x^(n+1)+1), which would be the general formula to the summation of any natural number (without 0) to any power.", "comment_date": "2022-02-26T01:04:51Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Ihab A.", "comment_text": "This seems like pseudoscience, just like the myths of quantum mechanics and the multiverse.

A stupid scholar all overturned this truth and built it to a convenient system of Mason. Thus, the people believe the trickery of the devil than words of God. Darwin&#39;s evolutionary theory, the Copernican theory of Galileo, the theory of relativity, quantum mechanics, mathematics, the medicine of Einstein are all errors. A ghost, a UFO, supernatural power, the miracle of God to be said to be the occult are rather true. A thing and a ghost (God) exist in the world, and space is active by spiritual power (conception) of God. As for God, all things were created by the soul of language. It is clear if I read the Bible. Because the present scholar mixes the logic thoroughly in human wisdom, it cannot arrive at the truth. It is intuitive power to be important. Why does a child seem to be? The thing which cannot answer this is a mistake. Our common sense is more right than a stupid scholar. The creation of God comes loose only by a fate. Everything becomes the material by a conception of God (person).<br> <br>I cannot prove 1+1 = 2 in a numerical formula. I can prove only a physical phenomenon to say that it is in two apples when I match another one apple with one apple. It is not 0+1 \u2260 1. As 0 (nothing) is not quality, you must not handle it for a number. Because quality is different even if I match a mandarin orange with an apple, there is not a meaning of the addition. Because it does not exist other than God when I define God as existence, no (0) does not exist. Because the mathematics defines 0, negative number, imaginary number, \u221e which do not exist in the world, it is an error and is a fiction. A number is to count quality. When I am separated from a physical phenomenon, the mathematics does not have the significance of being.<br><br>\u203bIf 0 exists by a definition of the mathematics, 0 of the infinity must exist. However, the infinite space, infinity do not exist. In other words, because the mathematics defines 0, negative number, imaginary number, \u221e which do not exist, it is an error and is a fiction. Therefore it is an error because a zeta function, the numerical formula of the second oiler product deal with this infinity. That it becomes sum of series \u03a3 = 1+2+3+ ... = - 1/12 of the natural number, or the product of all prime numbers is 4\u03c0^2. It turns out that it is an error if I think for common sense. It is limited, and the mathematician seems to get a wrong this, but uses the sophism when I calculate this endlessly if right. This is a mistake of the definition of 0 or \u221e and is the evidence that mathematics gets a wrong. It is definition f&#39;(x) = limh of the differential calculus that must not divide it by 0 \u2192 0 {the same as it being 0 that says that I bring h close to 0 without a limit, and dividing it by a numerical formula of f(x+h)-f(x)}/h. I divide it by 0. The mathematics is trickery not study in this way.<br><br> All the origins of the scientific theory are random, and a bottom is broken. For example, in the theory of elementary particles, an electron joins atoms together and becomes the molecules. A thing joining a proton and a neutron together is a mesotron, and three quarks connect the proton, and there is it. An electron and a positron (antimatter) occur from a photon. An elementary particle to tie the elementary particle to whenever a new elementary particle is discovered is necessary and loses the relations with an elementary particle and the elementary particle more and more. Though a proton and the neutron are the same mass, why does a difference occur in having electric charge or not? The science has no answer with it in these questions. An electron is a material so that I think, and the positron is not a material in the hole of the material loss that the circumference was surrounded by in the soul children. In other words, the antimatter is an illusion. The scholar is going to examine it logically and loses sight of the truth. The structure of built nature of God is simpler, but is the thing which it is hard to understand in the human wisdom. A photon seems to have a particle and the two characteristics of the wave, but, in fact, the light has the property of the wave with the soul body.<br><br> Message from the spiritual world of Einstein <br> When oneself saw a scene of heaven through a tunnel of the light in the meantime, the person who experienced suspended animation well is you after the revival. The moving speed of the soul does not receive gravitational restraint anymore, and, as for the law of the speed of light immutability that I discovered during the lifetime, there are none in the world of the consciousness. In other words, I will say that it just moves to say that I think. Furthermore, it is just handed down to a partner to have thought. The life of all of us shares what one interiority. And the material is to say that it was actually consciousness. There are all things in your heart, and, also, you are existence to live in a heart of all life. When all of this space watches it with eyes, it is seen like the outside world, but is to say that the world to be actually seen outside is your interiority.

I conquer the world in the life of the hell of the cruel survival of the fittest and am useless even if only oneself is going to be saved. Because a killed animal retaliates for a human being, cancer occurs. The meat which I ate becomes the blood, and a vindictive spirit dwells in a cell when blood does formation to a cell. A human being is cruel, and a fornication, a falsehood, committing theft, the habit of the evil deed of the luxury are not stopped. Eating meat is indirect killing. Why is God that existence of the evil is permitted? It lets you compensate for a human crime by the devil. A disaster, an epidemic, the war damage are the wrath of Heaven. Because a Japanese savior buys the crime of the world people, it is sacrificed. I fall in the trees and plants in spite of the pains then even if I writhe with a hell if it is just and changes the heart and does not straighten an act to measure up to hearts of God.

A stupid scholar all overturned this truth and built it to a convenient system of Mason. Thus, the people believe the trickery of the devil than words of God. Darwin&#39;s evolutionary theory, the Copernican theory of Galileo, the theory of relativity, quantum mechanics, mathematics, the medicine of Einstein are all errors. A ghost, a UFO, supernatural power, the miracle of God to be said to be the occult are rather true. A thing and a ghost (God) exist in the world, and space is active by spiritual power (conception) of God. As for God, all things were created by the soul of language. It is clear if I read the Bible. Because the present scholar mixes the logic thoroughly in human wisdom, it cannot arrive at the truth. It is intuitive power to be important. Why does a child seem to be? The thing which cannot answer this is a mistake. Our common sense is more right than a stupid scholar. The creation of God comes loose only by a fate. Everything becomes the material by a conception of God (person).<br> <br>I cannot prove 1+1 = 2 in a numerical formula. I can prove only a physical phenomenon to say that it is in two apples when I match another one apple with one apple. It is not 0+1 \u2260 1. As 0 (nothing) is not quality, you must not handle it for a number. Because quality is different even if I match a mandarin orange with an apple, there is not a meaning of the addition. Because it does not exist other than God when I define God as existence, no (0) does not exist. Because the mathematics defines 0, negative number, imaginary number, \u221e which do not exist in the world, it is an error and is a fiction. A number is to count quality. When I am separated from a physical phenomenon, the mathematics does not have the significance of being.<br><br>\u203bIf 0 exists by a definition of the mathematics, 0 of the infinity must exist. However, the infinite space, infinity do not exist. In other words, because the mathematics defines 0, negative number, imaginary number, \u221e which do not exist, it is an error and is a fiction. Therefore it is an error because a zeta function, the numerical formula of the second oiler product deal with this infinity. That it becomes sum of series \u03a3 = 1+2+3+ ... = - 1/12 of the natural number, or the product of all prime numbers is 4\u03c0^2. It turns out that it is an error if I think for common sense. It is limited, and the mathematician seems to get a wrong this, but uses the sophism when I calculate this endlessly if right. This is a mistake of the definition of 0 or \u221e and is the evidence that mathematics gets a wrong. It is definition f&#39;(x) = limh of the differential calculus that must not divide it by 0 \u2192 0 {the same as it being 0 that says that I bring h close to 0 without a limit, and dividing it by a numerical formula of f(x+h)-f(x)}/h. I divide it by 0. The mathematics is trickery not study in this way.<br><br> All the origins of the scientific theory are random, and a bottom is broken. For example, in the theory of elementary particles, an electron joins atoms together and becomes the molecules. A thing joining a proton and a neutron together is a mesotron, and three quarks connect the proton, and there is it. An electron and a positron (antimatter) occur from a photon. An elementary particle to tie the elementary particle to whenever a new elementary particle is discovered is necessary and loses the relations with an elementary particle and the elementary particle more and more. Though a proton and the neutron are the same mass, why does a difference occur in having electric charge or not? The science has no answer with it in these questions. An electron is a material so that I think, and the positron is not a material in the hole of the material loss that the circumference was surrounded by in the soul children. In other words, the antimatter is an illusion. The scholar is going to examine it logically and loses sight of the truth. The structure of built nature of God is simpler, but is the thing which it is hard to understand in the human wisdom. A photon seems to have a particle and the two characteristics of the wave, but, in fact, the light has the property of the wave with the soul body.<br><br> Message from the spiritual world of Einstein <br> When oneself saw a scene of heaven through a tunnel of the light in the meantime, the person who experienced suspended animation well is you after the revival. The moving speed of the soul does not receive gravitational restraint anymore, and, as for the law of the speed of light immutability that I discovered during the lifetime, there are none in the world of the consciousness. In other words, I will say that it just moves to say that I think. Furthermore, it is just handed down to a partner to have thought. The life of all of us shares what one interiority. And the material is to say that it was actually consciousness. There are all things in your heart, and, also, you are existence to live in a heart of all life. When all of this space watches it with eyes, it is seen like the outside world, but is to say that the world to be actually seen outside is your interiority. The relativity disappears in here, and this space consists based on &quot;universal truth to certainly say to call God&quot;. <br><br> Near future to read from revelation and illuminati card of God of days, and to untie it in Japan<br> April, 2020 xx day The United States bombs North Korea. North Korea adds nuclear attack to a big city of Japan and a U.S. base as the retaliation. Japan swats it to a bog of the war, and they are dropped by a plot of the United States. There are China, Russia after North Korea and becomes the fight with Japan, American allied powers and drags the world into World War 3.<br> x moon xx Japan and the United States country attacks it in Japan with the Allied Forces in 2021<br> World War 3 begins in 2021 on xx moon xx day<br> Mount Fuji erupts very much on xx day in October, 2023.

I conquer the world in the life of the hell of the cruel survival of the fittest and am useless even if only oneself is going to be saved. Because a killed animal retaliates for a human being, cancer occurs. The meat which I ate becomes the blood, and a vindictive spirit dwells in a cell when blood does formation to a cell. A human being is cruel, and a fornication, a falsehood, committing theft, the habit of the evil deed of the luxury are not stopped. Eating meat is indirect killing. Why is God that existence of the evil is permitted? It lets you compensate for a human crime by the devil. A disaster, an epidemic, the war damage are the wrath of Heaven. Because a Japanese savior buys the crime of the world people, it is sacrificed. I fall in the trees and plants in spite of the pains then even if I writhe with a hell if it is just and changes the heart and does not straighten an act to measure up to hearts of God. Mason finally leads the world to the World War 3. it is started with nuclear attack to Japan as a pilot light.

A stupid scholar all overturned this truth and built it to a convenient system of Mason. Thus, the people believe the trickery of the devil than words of God. What is called brainwashing without expressing brainwashing in this? Darwin&#39;s evolutionary theory, the Copernican theory of Galileo, the theory of relativity, quantum mechanics, mathematics, medicine, the genetic engineering (the gene is the soul of language as for the gene a tool) of Einstein are all errors. A ghost, a UFO (as for the alien a lie), supernatural power, a miracle, telepathy of God, the moment movement to be said to be the occult are rather true. A thing and a ghost (God) exist in the world, and space is active by spiritual power (conception) of God. As for God, all things were created by the soul of language. It is clear if I read the Bible. Because the present scholar mixes the logic thoroughly in human wisdom, it cannot arrive at the truth. It is intuitive power to be important. Why does a child seem to be? The thing which cannot answer this is a mistake. Our common sense is more right than a stupid scholar. The creation of God comes loose only by a fate. Everything becomes the material by a conception of God (person).\r<br>\r<br>I cannot prove 1+1 = 2 in a numerical formula. I can prove only a physical phenomenon to say that it is in two apples when I match another one apple with one apple. An apple becomes extinct suddenly and does not become 1+1 = 2 like an operation of the other self if a number is quality to increase. It is not 0+1 \u2260 1. As 0 (nothing) is not quality, you must not handle it for a number. Because quality is different even if I match a mandarin orange with an apple, there is not a meaning of the addition. Because it does not exist other than God when I define God as existence (integer), no (0) does not exist.\r<br>\r<br>If 0 exists by a definition of the mathematics, 0 of the infinity must exist. However, infinite space is infinite (\u221e) and does not exist either. In other words, because the mathematics defines 0, negative number, imaginary number, \u221e which do not exist, it is an error and is a fiction. Therefore it is an error because a zeta function, the numerical formula of the second oiler product deal with this infinity. That it becomes sum of series \u03a3 = 1+2+3+ ... = - 1/12 of the natural number, or the product of all prime numbers is 4\u03c0^2. It turns out that it is an error if I think for common sense. It is limited, and the mathematician seems to get a wrong this, but uses the sophism when I calculate this endlessly if right. This is mistake definition of 0or \u221e and is the evidence that mathematics gets a wrong. It is definition f&#39;(x) = limh of the differential calculus that must not divide it by 0 \u2192 0 {the same as it being 0 that says that I bring h close to 0 without a limit, and dividing it by a numerical formula of f(x+h)-f(x)}/h. I divide it by 0. The mathematics is trickery not study in this way.\r<br>\r<br>It was done that Einstein who hit the contradiction of the uncertainness theory that became the quantum-mechanical basics returned by contradiction of own theory of relativity and defeated it. When Mitsuko of the one of the boxes of a theory, the light jumps out of a shutter, a spring shrinks, and a box lightens, and true time becomes uncertain because time advances if mass by the theory of relativity lightens. Therefore I concluded that an uncertain theory was right. The principle of constancy of light velocity of Einstein is an error, and the special theory of relativity from it is a mistake, too. Thus, the quantum mechanics is blague.\r<br>\r<br>I find out a lie of Einstein\r<br>UFOA took off in speed of light C from 0 spots to the right direction, and UFOB took off at the same time in speed of light C from 0 spots to the left direction. In A, B arrived at the point of Ckm from 0 spots to the left at the point of Ckm from 0 spots to the right one second later. The distance of the meantime is 2Ckm. The speed to see UFOB becomes double speed of light C from UFOA. This is right than it is measured in a speedometer. The principle of constancy of light velocity is an error. In other words, the theory of relativity is a lie. I know it even if I think about such a thing for common sense. A law of the addition of the speed is why and is applicable to a material, and is it not applicable to light? Naturally it is applicable to light. Time stops when I exercise in speed of light, and mass becomes infinite. Why is so; cannot examine it. In other words, such a thing is a lie.\r<br>\r<br>Message of the spiritual world of Einstein <br>When oneself saw a scene of heaven through a tunnel of the light in the meantime, the person who experienced suspended animation well is you after the revival. The moving speed of the soul does not receive gravitational restraint anymore, and, as for the law of the speed of light immutability that I discovered during the lifetime, there are none in the world of the consciousness. In other words, I will say that it just moves to say that I think. Furthermore, it is just handed down to a partner to have thought. The life of all of us shares what one interiority. And the material is to say that it was actually consciousness. There are all things in your heart, and, also, you are existence to live in a heart of all life. When all of this space watches it with eyes, it is seen like the outside world, but is to say that the world to be actually seen outside is your interiority. The relativity disappears in here, and this space consists based on &quot;universal truth to certainly say to call God&quot;. \r<br>\r<br>The scientists equal to my younger student arrive at an outbreak point of the space named the BIC barn from my formula and seem to argue variously, but, as for it, do not have a meaning too much. This is because it is in one, and an infinite opening and all properties that a phase contradicts it at all called at the infinite end and the eternity exist in this space. In other words, it includes the whole (God) at the same time that it is 1, and it is a religious concept to say that the whole is 1 (God) at the same time.\r<br>\r<br>\u203bLet&#39;s prove that the Copernican theory of Galileo is a lie\r<br>I should be able to observe movement to rotate of the earth from a flying airplane, but seem to hardly move. The atmosphere and the airplane are at one with the earth and do not rotate. Because the wind blows from all directions of north, south, east and west, the atmosphere is not restricted on the earth. Because freedom can navigate the airplane in the atmosphere, I am not restricted by the atmosphere. The botfly flew lightly when I observed the state that threw a botfly in the airplane which was surely flying, and flew without being affected by the inertial force that the weight of the botfly by the speed of the airplane brought about. This is evidence to say that I do not produce the inertial force in the airplane shut in. In other words, mind (even if I make a vacuum like) of the space before and after the horsefly denies an inertial force. An air pocket after the object exercises creates the inertial forces. Therefore an inertial force acts forward if an inertial force acts after the airplane and slows down suddenly. However, the atmosphere on the earth flows in the state that is not pasted on the earth freely. Therefore the driving force of the airplane damps by just that much if an airplane navigates it against the inertial force (by the centrifugal force) to the east direction by the rotation of the earth to the west direction. As for the inertial force that the rotation of the earth of 1,700km per an hour produces, it is thought about with a considerably big thing enough an airplane not being able to move.\r<br>The speed of the rotation of the earth of the neighborhood of equator is 1,700km per an hour. If the ground moves at this speed when an airplane lands, the airplane is completely demolished by the shock. The reason why it is not completely demolished is that the earth does not rotate.\r<br><br>All the origins of the scientific theory are random, and a bottom is broken. For example, in the theory of elementary particles, an electron joins atoms together and becomes the molecules. A thing joining a proton and a neutron together is a mesotron, and three quarks connect the proton, and there is it. An electron and a positron (antimatter) occur from a photon. An elementary particle to tie the elementary particle to whenever a new elementary particle is discovered is necessary and loses the relations with an elementary particle and the elementary particle more and more. Though a proton and the neutron are the same mass, why does a difference occur in having electric charge or not? The science has no answer with it in these questions. An electron is a material so that I think, and the positron is not a material in the hole of the material loss that the circumference was surrounded by in the soul children. In other words, the antimatter is an illusion. The scholar is going to examine it logically and loses sight of the truth. The structure of built nature of God is simpler, but is the thing which it is hard to understand in the human wisdom. A photon seems to have a particle and the two characteristics of the wave, but, in fact, the light has the property of the wave in the soul children.", "comment_date": "2021-10-03T22:43:26Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Trum Trum", "comment_text": "There is something illogical about that room distance theory thing.", "comment_date": "2021-10-03T14:52:51Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "\u04221000 Youtube", "comment_text": "<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XFDM1ip5HdU&amp;t=5m30s\">5:30</a> that moment felt like a cartoon about mathematicians trying to solidify stuff to beat other mathematicians over the opinions of does that concept make sense.<br><br>My comment certainly doesn&#39;t but the general idea is here.<br><br><br><br><br>Tbh I kinda described real math with a contrast filter.", "comment_date": "2021-10-02T19:31:07Z", "likes_count": 13}, {"comment_by": "DIOMEDES ABCMNXYZ", "comment_text": "~ The ability to accomplish goals is done by not setting limitations on your determination to succeed.

So wouldn&#39;t it be more accurate to say, &quot;ASSUMING that no matter how many numbers you choose . . . . &quot; Any new math has assumptions that seem logical to make, yet we do not know if they are true. In the case of limits, we don&#39;t know where the function is going, it&#39;s just a guess. Then, once we&#39;ve defined that concept (limits) based on these assumptions, we relate it to the concepts potentially built up in a similar way. Math is rigorous, but only once concepts are accepted and the interrelations of mathematics is accepted that makes up the web of mathematics. As soon as you question why a concept in math exists or not, the only way out is to relate it to other concepts and/or simply make assumptions that make it likely to exist. This is one reason why students find math confusing, because they are unaware that it is built on softer ground than they at first realize. As an epistemological system, the correspondence and relations among mathematical objects is excellent, but it&#39;s still a closed system that can be &quot;poked open&quot; by a critical outsider or child asking &quot;Why should that be true&quot; of any of its objects. &quot;Well, if we assume this, that, and the other, then it&#39;s reasonable that this should be the case,&quot; such as all those numbers guaranteed to fall within the distance between the point and X. Seems like a &quot;plausible&quot; notion around which to build an idea. After that, we work out the consequences of inputting that object into the system.

I think that in real world terms, the tiniest difference at the infinite end of the spectrum doesn&#39;t matter most of the time, so it probably doesn&#39;t matter if you consider it equal to 1. I think that sometimes people confuse numbers with reality.  Sometimes very small differences do matter in the real world, particularly when multiplying these small numbers by very large numbers: on a universal size scale, if your trajectory at departure was out by a very, very tiny amount, you  could miss the galaxy you were aiming for by many billions of miles. Negative numbers are not a physical reality, but they are handy for working with  distance perspectives in the real world. I understand that physical  property analogies can be useful to explain complex mathematical things, but the description remains an analogy.  Sometimes analogies are confusing, because they look like something, which they do not actually represent. I think Hilbert&#39;s infinite hotel is another example of this. If the infinite hotel is full, then you cannot put a person in room one and move everyone up by one room. The infinite hotel is never full, by the definition of infinity: it continues forever.

Don&#39;t use iteration.  Use recursion, because you can solve that for an answer without doing any iterations at all.  S = 1 + 2S.  S expands to 1 + 2 + 4 + ... ... while also solving for -1.  But it is S that is EQUAL to -1, not a generically unspecified 1 + 2 + 4 + ....   Note that you can cut a recursive sum into a head and a tail.  S = 1 + 2S = 1 + 2 + 4S = 1 + 2 + 4 + 8S = (2^N - 1) + (2^N)S.  N isn&#39;t infinite here.  It just facilitates a closed form for any N you like, of any arbitrary size.  Call (2^N - 1) the Limit, and (2^N)S the Tail.  (S = Limit + Tail), so  (S - Tail = Limit) is a general phenomenon.  So algebraically solve for Limit with N as high as you like.  BOTH Limit and Tail have infinite values.  But (S - Tail) solves for -1, no matter what N is (!!).  ex:  (S-8S = 1+2+4) = (S(1-8) = 1+2+4) -&gt; S=-1.  <br><br>It isn&#39;t an accident that this is the same phenomenon as 2&#39;s complement.  If you extend the binary representation into decimals, you can see why binary with all 1s to right of decimal are equal to 1; due to there needing to be a carry since it is known that there will be no zeroes in the bits to the right of the decimal.  This is why you negate a 2&#39;s complement integer with &quot;flip all bits and add 1&quot;, because the add1 represented as binary decimal has all 1s in the decimal places, which carry to add 1.

In some sense I agree with the sentiment of this, but I disagree with the form.  I do NOT think that math involves &#39;objects&#39;; I think it involves relationships &amp; rules.  If I were going to explain what math means to me, I would say this.  &quot;Imagine we are aliens.  We are somewhere in our home galaxy, minding our own business.  Wherever we are as individuals, in the next moment we ALL find ourselves in a strange room.  It&#39;s got no doors; no windows; only chairs.  And one wall is a large screen - like a TV screen.  Since we can&#39;t get out, we all sit down.  As soon as we do this, the screen comes alive.  We see strange creatures [humans!] involved in what appears to be some ritual - whether a contest, a game, or what - we have no idea [a baseball game!]  Now, as we watch these odd-looking, ungainly beings go about their weird activity, we begin to notice certain things.  Namely, the same kind of thing keeps repeating in cycles.  We learn that after the creature with the club [bat] swings at the small sphere being thrown at him 3 times, he must go away.  But he does get another chance later on.&quot;  I&#39;ll drop all pretenses here.  Suffice it to say that as we watch the humans play baseball, we learn about the game.  There are 3 distinct phases to our learning; &amp; one all-important takeaway.  In phase 1, we learn some of the basic rules - the most common ones, which come up a lot.  In phase 2, we&#39;ve learned enough to begin to test our knowledge by making predictions about what will happen next.  And finally, in phase 3, we can get speculative; we can wonder (for instance), &quot;What would happen if one of the people in the  stands reached over the wall &amp; caught a ball?  Would it be a home run?  A ground-rule double?  Or an out?&quot;  I hope you see where this is all going.  It&#39;s about learning; about discovery.  And, YES: we DO discover &#39;something.&#39;  But what IS it that we discover?  Well, obviously, it the RULES OF THE GAME - not mathematical &#39;objects&#39;, but their relationships!  THAT&#39;S the all-important takeaway.  And THAT&#39;S what math means to me.  So, while I&#39;m not exactly a Platonist, I DO feel their plight, if you see what I mean!

What one must understand is that EVERY mathematical concept explaining the nature is merely a model, or an approximation (in a sense) of it. The real number system is not an exception.<br><br>For example, we all think that time is real-valued. But it might be true that time is discrete with mesh size (for example) 10^(-10000) seconds. There is no way to actually prove that the time is continuous. What we can prove (by observations) is that the model that assumes that the time is real-valued predicts the behavior of the nature quite well. The real-number system as a mathematical object only exists in our mind.<br><br>In this perspective, any mathematical system, like p-adics or complex number for example, make sense as long as they are consistent to the &quot;dominating rules&quot; of the higher hierarchy. (In this p-adic example, the dominating rules are the properties of metrics on algebraic systems.) They are just different rules. For example, with the same trump deck and the poker rule, you can play either Texas or Omaha. It would be foolish to say that &quot;Texas is right and Omaha is wrong&quot;, or &quot;Since you receive 2 hand cards in Texas, receiving 4 cards in Omaha is a wrong rule.&quot; The Texas rule being more commonly played does not change this fact, even if literally NO ONE plays Omaha. And I tell you, the p-adic theory is far from some rulebook of a game which no one plays today. Rather, it is a very common notion to modern number theorists. (I&#39;m sure that most graduate and some undergraduate math majors have heard of p-adic system.)<br><br> A wise person wouldn&#39;t say that something is wrong so easily, because being wise is not a matter of knowing things, but a matter of knowing that I don&#39;t know.", "comment_date": "2019-01-16T08:23:31Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "AlienCatCrew333", "comment_text": "GOD INVENTED MATH, HUMANS JUST DISCOVERED IT.", "comment_date": "2019-01-15T04:25:45Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Mael-Strom", "comment_text": "Numbers are abstractions representing fixed quantities of somethings.

Saying 1 + 2 + 4 + 16 + \u2022\u2022\u2022 = -1 is perfectly valid and be made by rigorous proof. Summation does not have to obey our intuition or what we dictate is common sense: most of math does not obey intuition, and common sense is very often wrong, as both math and science have demonstrated throughout history. Whether a statement about infinite summation is true or not depends on the axioms of the theory, and there is no need to change the metric of field of numbers with which we work. For starters, the limit of the sequence of the partial sums of an ordered sequence is fundamentally distinct and unrelated to the ordered summation of all the elements of a given set. Deciding to create an equivalence class between the two is an arbitrary choice of axioms, but there is no necessity to accept this choice or exclude any other possible choice. If we can consistently and rigorously assign a value to a series, then what the limit is and whether it diverges or not is irrelevant. To illustrate the point, it can be true that x \u2014&gt; 0 implies f(x) \u2014&gt; 0, but that f(0) = 1 instead, as with a step function, or any discontinuous function. Whatever the meaning is of infinite summation, we decide it. Let \u03a3(from n = a to n = b, f(n) ) = \u03a3(from n = a + c to n = b + c, f(n - c) ) hold true for all ordinal numbers a, b, and c. Then it is trivial to demonstrate that if 1 + 2 + 4 + \u2022\u2022\u2022 has any arithmetic simplification, then it must simplify to the value -1. There are no constraints on whether it can have a value or not. The convergence theorem says that if the limit of the sequence of partial sums of the series converges, then the series equals this limit, but provided that the limit diverges, this tells us nothing about whether the series can have value or not, or what the value is. We can consistently find methods to evaluate the series, and these methods can be and most often are compatible with the convergence theorem, since for convergent series, the methods return the same value those series have by the convergence theorem, but for divergent series, they still return a value, much in the same fashion that the Gamma function is a domain extension of the factorial function, but it still is compatible with the factorial function whenever the factorial function is defined. In fact, one could state that both functions are equal up to a shift.

First of all, if you take the number 1/5.  It is greater than 0 yet less than 1.  If you add 1/5, 1/25, 1/125, 1/625 ... it doesn&#39;t approach 1, it approaches .25.  If instead, you are saying that you are taking the same amount of WHAT IS LEFT between 1 and 0 (For example, you take 1/3 leaving you with 2/3 so you take 1/3 of the 2/3 more.  Now you have taken 1/3+2/9 which leaves you with 4/9.  You take 1/3 of that.  You have now taken 1/3 +2/9+4/27(=19/27) which leaves you with 8/27 distance remaining until you hit 1 on the numberline.  If you take 1/3 of that you will now have taken away 1/3+2/9+4/27+8/81(=65/81).  Sot the math is as follows--- If you take away p, the remainder between 0 and 1 is (1-p).  Now when you take p increment from that remainder, you have lengths p and p(1-p) and the remainder is 1-p-(p(1-p)) which equals 1-2p+p^2.  When you take away p increment from that remainder, you have lengths p, p(1-p), p(1-2p+p^2), and a remainder of length1-(3p-3p^2+p^3).  So it isn&#39;t p, p(1-p), p^2(1-p), p^3(1-p), etc.  Just do the math.  His does not cancel terms and add to one.  If you add up your lengths with the math I just yielded, you have p+p(1-p)+p(1-2p+p^2)+1-(3p-3p^2+p^3)=1.  Now simplify for parentheses and you get p+p-p^2+p-2p^2+p^3+1-3p+3p^2-p^3.  If you add the terms, you see that the 3 positive ps cancel with 3 negative ps, the negative 3p^2 cancels with the positive 3p^2 and the p^3 cancels the -p^3.  So basically, this guy has approached his math from two different directions at the same time and crossed himself up.  <br>    As far as number theory and distances between numbers being expressed as multi-dimensional rooms of varying sizes arranged in imaginary planes; it really doesn&#39;t serve any purpose.  Multi-dimensional math of course serves a purpose as it lets us factor in forces and weights in addition to the physical size of an object.  However, redefining and constantly changing the rules of an experiment in order to obtain a predetermined outcome is exactly the opposite of the scientific method.  1+2+3+4+5...=1/2 isn&#39;t fuzzy logic, it isn&#39;t logic at all.", "comment_date": "2018-10-18T17:15:16Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Aditya Sankar", "comment_text": "Mr. 3Blue1Brown, how do you understand these concepts so deeply and innately?

We see a smoth movement of the right part, from 0 to pi.

I&#39;m hoping you can help me understand something in this video.  By the way, I just discovered your channel a week or two ago, and I think your videos are simply awesome!  So here goes... <br><br>I understand you OK up to the point at 6m 14s where you have:  <br><br>(1-p) + p(1-p) + (p^2)(1-p) + (p^3)(1-p) + p^4 = 1  and on and on.  Then it changes to <br><br>(1-p) + p(1-p) + (p^2)(1-p) + (p^3)(1-p) + ...  = 1.  And you factored out (1-p).  BUT, my question is, before you factored, shouldn&#39;t it have been<br><br>(1-p) + p(1-p) + (p^2)(1-p) + (p^3)(1-p) + ... + (p^(n-1))(1-p) + p^n = 1?  <br><br>I understand that the last term, p^n, would approach zero for 0&lt;p&lt;1, and it would be safe to ignore it.  But, if &quot;p&quot; is greater than 1, then p^n goes towards infinity, right?<br><br>That means, if &quot;p&quot; is going to be &quot;2&quot;, we can&#39;t ignore the last term, p^n.  So, before we can factor out (1-p) you have to subtract p^n from both sides. Then it would be:<br><br>(1-p) + p(1-p) + (p^2)(1-p) + (p^3)(1-p) + ...  + (p^(n-1))(1-p) = 1 - p^n.  Then, factoring out (1-p) would give:<br><br>1 + p + p^2 + p^3 + ... + p^(n-1) = (1-p^n)/(1-p).

I may not end up describing this very well.<br><br>Let&#39;s say you&#39;re on a number line, and you&#39;re looking for odd multiples of certain powers of 2. Or, to phrase it another way, binary numbers ending in a certain number of zeros. Never mind why, you just are. So, if you want, say, binary numbers that end in 3 zeros, finding them is easy: Start at 0 (which, in binary, &quot;ends&quot; with an infinite number of zeros, so it&#39;s 2^(infinity), like in your video), and move 8 spaces to the right. Now you&#39;re on 8, which is 1*2^3, or 1000 in binary. If you want another number ending in 3 zeros, move 16 spaces in any direction. Or any multiple of 16. You could jump over to 24, for example (3*2^3, or 11000). If you want to find a number ending in 5 or more zeros, well... You need to try moving 8 spaces one way, then 8 the other. In one direction, you&#39;re guaranteed to find a number ending in 4 zeros, and in the other, you&#39;ll find a number ending in 5 or more. But you don&#39;t know ahead of time which direction will work, so you have to try them both.<br><br>Now, suddenly, a tornado grabs you (I cribbed that from L Frank Baum) and drops you off on a number line constructed from the formula 1+5n.

Visually on your boxes you put -1 to the extreme right of 1 yet in 0&#39;s box 2 is halfway between 1 and 0 (not to the extreme right of 0 in the same box) . In any event, it jars at the very beginning of the video to find 0 in the same box as all powers of 2 greater than one. It seem so arbitrary. Why must -1 be in same box as 1 yet 0 must not be in the same box as 1? Although your argument makes sense once all the arbitrary assumptions are accepted and a fantasy distance function emerges, this arbitrariness makes much less compelling the final claim that the infinite sum equals -1.  Somewhere it should be said that the infinite sum equals some kind of infinity but if you design a fantasy distance function you can make that sum equal -1.

So then if we make n arbitrarily large, approaching infinity, we would get the same result, except using congruence classes it is a lot easier. At least it is for me since I took a course in college where we studied groups and rings and did a whole lot of work with congruence classes (basically the remainder when you divide  numbers by a common divisor which is the number things are modulo of). It is called modular arithmetic. The powers of 2 adding up to -1 makes perfect sense if you think in terms of modular arithmetic, because if you keep increasing the divisor that everything is modulo of from one power of 2 to the next one, -1 is still congruent to that power of 2 minus one no matter how high you go, and thus this solution is just obvious.<br><br>Also if you look at how computers typically store negative integers, whether we are talking 8-bit, 16-bit, 32-bit, or 64-bit integers, this also provides us with a really neat clue also, since signed integers on computers are done using modular arithmetic, so the way -1 is represented on a computer using signed integers is as a power of 2 minus one. If you generalize the number of bits the number is represented with and imagine a computer that can store an infinite-bit integer, and ask how it would represent -1 as a signed integer, well then that is another way to find the solution to this problem and confirm this infinite sum.

In fact I just see p-adic numbers as reals numbers with a different metric.<br><br>but this feels a little bit weird since to get: 1+2+4+8+\u2026 = -1 you have to say that 2^(n) = 0 when n\u2014&gt; infty  so you&#39;re changing the number but the distance to 0 which is not quite the same\u2026 since dist(0, -1) = 1 if I&#39;m not wrong so 1+2+4+8+\u2026 you could say is 1 in 2-adic numbers and not -1.", "comment_date": "2017-09-25T16:07:28Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Ajinkya Tejankar", "comment_text": "What&#39;s the music in the background?

This is a variation of Zeno&#39;s most famous paradox.<br><br>We can think of 0.999\u2026 as a variation of Zeno&#39;s paradoxes on infinite division. The paradox is that if we keep moving to a point that is nine tenths of the remaining distance then we cannot reach the target value of 1. No point in the series (of the infinitely many points we can reach) exists that is equal to the limit. Thus if an &#39;infinite sum&#39; could somehow exist, it demonstrably could not equal the limit.<br><br>The paradox questions the nature of space and or time. Zeno wondered if time or space could be truly continuous (endlessly divisible) or if space and time have a granular nature (consists of a series of smallest parts).<br><br>We know in the real world we can reach a given target position. But we cannot reach it by a series of moves where each move is nine tenths the remaining distance. Therefore we must reach the target by some different kind of moves (because this approach is not a valid way to represent real-world movement).<br><br>With his Arrow paradox, Zeno proposed that the alternative was equally troublesome. If movement consisted of a series of smallest parts, like the individual frames that make up a moving picture, then at each frame all movement is stopped. So he suggested that this meant an arrow would not be able to travel forwards because in any given frame it has stopped.<br><br>In his Arrow paradox he made an assumption about the physical world. He assumed that an object cannot have momentum if time and space are granular. This dubious assumption about physics is the only argument he had to support the claim that time and space cannot be granular.<br><br>The question arises as to what is mathematics all about. I hoped your video would address this given its title &quot;What does it feel like to invent math?&quot;.<br><br>Maths began as a tool devised to solve real-world problems and to provide reusable (generalised) solutions.

But to claim that maths is not related to the physical universe is to make it a supernatural belief system. This is what a belief in the supernatural means\u2026 the belief in something that has no physical existence. <br><br>If we accept maths is a tool for modelling physics, then maths has clarity of meaning and purpose. If we try to model movement in terms of a series of steps where each step only covers a proportion of the remaining distance, then as we cannot reach the final position we must conclude our model is incorrect. <br><br>If we model movement as a series of &#39;smallest possible&#39; movements, then we can reach the final position, so this approach is a candidate for modelling movement.<br><br>If we believe maths has its own non-physical existence and that it reveals things to us about the universe, then we might well accept the series of proportional steps can somehow overcome its &#39;never reaches&#39; problem by the mysterious nature of infinity. Thus the infinite sum can be realised!<br><br>In my opinion, maths is in the chemistry of the brain, on a computer, or in written form.

For any whole number N, if one subtracts 1 from any number whose &quot;last&quot; N digits (rightmost N digits to the left of the radix point) are zero, the result will be a number whose last N digits are 1.  Conversely, adding 1 to a number which ends with at least N ones will yield a number which ends with at least N zeroes.  There is only value for which the last N digits will be zero for any N; that value is of course zero.

You generate a compact metric space, specifically an L2 Hilbert Space. The process by which you &#39;&#39;allow&#39;&#39; this is by taking the adjacency matrix as the argument of a power-law function.  The trick is to redefine your adjacency matrix as 1 if d(n,m) = 1 and 0 if d(n,m) \\neq 1, where n and m are arbitrary vertices. The adjacency relation is thus defined through a metric. If we think of n and m as being an element of the reals then our adjacency matrix has continuous indices. We can use shift invariance, or as we mathematical physicists call it a &#39;perturation&#39;, namely d(n+\\delta n, m + \\delta m) = k + \\delta k. Thus, the power of our continuous adjacency matrix shifts the indices of our continuous adjacency matrix! So having a power k of our discrete adjacency matrix that is an element of the reals should be isomorphic to repeated matrix multiplication of continuous matrices -- which is a freaking Path Integral! <a href=\"https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Jarod_Benowitz2\">https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Jarod_Benowitz2</a>", "comment_date": "2016-04-20T04:01:49Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "aleksander suur", "comment_text": "When sums of infinite series first came about one mathematician called them something along the lines of &quot;unholy abominations man was not meant to ponder&quot; and for good reason I think.

So it doesn&#39;t matter where 0 and -1 are placed in &#39;absolute&#39; terms as long as all numbers are in the correct place relative to each other. This is why I can see this working in real world applications, where all operations on numbers are about their distances relative to each other.

Because whether you discover or invent new math, it has to be useful somewhere, or you&#39;re just playing a very elaborate game. Even theoretical mathematics in physics is used to understand the world.<br><br>The reason I&#39;m saying this is not to anger anyone. It&#39;s to explain that you don&#39;t need math to arrive at the same conclusion you did. That p+p^2+p^3...+p^n=-1 in what you call &#39;infinite sums&#39;.<br><br>You&#39;re basically saying that the notion of moving towards something and already being there is the same thing. You&#39;re taking time out of the equation. It&#39;s what you would need to assume for the above formula to be true. But all I have to do is understand the idea of infinity, and understand it has no place in mathematics. Infinity isn&#39;t a very large number, higher than any you can think of. Infinity is the concept of everything. At least in the real world it would be that: everything. Actually it would be every different type of everything. <br><br>And you actually realise too. You say &#39;whatever that means&#39; after you mention infinity. Yet you still use it in math, in a finite frame of mind. I&#39;m aware that you sort of mention this when explaining that if you stop the sum, you&#39;re not tending towards anything. But that&#39;s exactly it: You make the choice to stop the sum. So it doesn&#39;t tend towards anything. Only when you make the choice to imagine going on &#39;forever&#39;, can you say it tends towards -1. In fact if you make the choice of it going on forever, it would, in my opinion, tend towards any number you want. Because you&#39;re defining the terms of what it means to &#39;equal&#39;. <br><br>If I&#39;m not mistaken, math is a set of rules that you can&#39;t really just break. You can change them, and set a frame of reference for that change, to share it with others, and so &#39;invent&#39; new math. But if you&#39;re going to put infinity, the idea of actual infinity in there, you&#39;re going to need, ironically, to define it better than just a big number. Because otherwise you get oddities like adding things get to -1. <br><br>I&#39;ll give an example where that&#39;s true, in the real world. You want to add apples together, and but you have no enthusiasm. So you start adding the apples together, and double the amount you add everytime you add, and eventually you get really tired, and frustrated because you have to carry more and more apples each time, and not get it wrong, and not only do you now not have any enthusiasm, but you&#39;re worse off than before. Whatever the opposite of enthusiasm is you have one of that. But one bit of the opposite of enthusiasm, expressed in enthusiasm is -1. So adding things together, and doubling what you add everytime, makes -1. It&#39;s just that I have to use the idea of infinity to do so. Remember not the big number, the concept of everything. When I start messing around with infinity, I can turn anything into anything else. So on one side of my equation I can have apples being added, and on the other, (because messing around with infinity has made me turn my &#39;equal&#39; into a different type of equal), I can have levels of enthusiasm, <b>for example</b>. It could be anything else. <br><br>Basically change what &#39;equal&#39; means, and any math can be true. But I&#39;m not sure you realised you changed the menaing of equal, because you used, I think, different types of infinities to do so, without actually paying attention to what it would mean in the real world. Following the math is fun, but does it actually mean anything? Perhaps it does, and you&#39;re just not explaining it in the video.<br><br>I&#39;m sorry I&#39;m so explicit, I just don&#39;t like how math is being praised everywhere, when so many people don&#39;t seem to understand that it&#39;s, in my opinion, not enough to use math to understand things, you have to add meaning to every inch of that math, so as to avoid errors in interpretation. But maybe I&#39;m just focused on physics. I think physics is making lots of mistakes because they&#39;re not trying to understand the math. But math can be useful in other areas. <br><br>So props for making a cool video, it explains math better than others do. :)", "comment_date": "2015-11-30T11:36:26Z", "likes_count": 4}, {"comment_by": "Xiao's Channel", "comment_text": "Why is somehow defining divergent infinite sums as finite numbers useful?", "comment_date": "2015-11-30T09:12:14Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "navry01", "comment_text": "So basically it works only if you completely redefine what it means.

While I love Numberphile a lot, you give your viewers&#39; level of understanding a lot more credit, and you explain these concepts beautifully. I remember Vi Hart mentioning the p-adics briefly in one of her videos, but you took on the task of actually explaining them in a way that makes sense, and tied it all into the arbitrary (although consistent) notions behind metrics, and how we use them to think of an &quot;organization&quot; to the rational numbers.
