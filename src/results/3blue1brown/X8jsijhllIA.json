If there are an even number of 1&#39;s in a row we assign it a 1. Otherwise it&#39;s assigned a 0. Do the same for the columns. If one bit is changed and we assign 1&#39;s and 0&#39;s to the rows and columns again, one row and one column will be changed too so now we know the changed bit&#39;s coordinates on the grid! For 256 bits, we would need 2(256)^.5=32 bits. This isn&#39;t efficient enough, but we can do better.<br> If we arrange the bits in a cube the same logic will apply, but we assign 1&#39;s and 0&#39;s to a square layer instead of a row. For 256 bits we would need 3(256)^.(1/3)=19.04--should have remembered 256 isn&#39;t cubic--88... Ok so you can&#39;t use a cube for 256, but instead of a cube we can have a 4x8x8 prism which would require 4+8+8=20bits which is improvement!<br> Now let&#39;s skip a couple dimensions to an 8 dimensional hyper cube. For 256 bits we would need 8(256)^(1/8)=16bits No!!! I was really banking on that being 8bits. Funny enough 4(256) ^(1/4)=16 so the skip didn&#39;t save any data!<br>I know I haven&#39;t wrapped it up (there&#39;s some interesting issues when trying to incorporate the redundant bits into the rest), but I gotta watch the rest of the video (and sleep) eventually!

This is all about transmitting information at different levels cohesively. It reminds me of the pseudo Hillbert curves, with the matrix being that curve. One level is the bytes, 1 and 0, and the next level is the even or odd nature of the matrix coming from adding up the 1&#39;s or 0&#39;s, the parity  is the new level of bytes. Then deriving 4 patterns from the matrix to work with is another level where the parity number takes part. The kicker for me is bringing in chaos theory (?) to see maybe that the a-periodic elements are the information, the periodic elements are like the background and as described by Sapolsky in his lecture 21 about chaos, with three chaotic (a-periodic) elements in a complex system having the effect of disrupting the system. So, what overcoming noise means, is to have 2 or 4 chaotic (information) elements but not three. It&#39;s kind of cool how this hamming codes thing is like Pitman shorthand, especially when the parity number is included and takes part, it seems to transcend a level, like the computer is for the codes, the brain is the focal point to translate spoken language into lines and squiggles and dots of Pitman, later to convert back into English or whatever.<br><br>Edit; my guess is that 8 lines of info (8 a-periodic elements) were tried but the fuzziness ruins the info because there&#39;s too many chances for that 3 element thing to happen (on a low level, but it still messes thing up) and what&#39;s needed is to do the same type of thing as including the parity while deriving 4 patterns from one, do this but on a much higher level of complexity.", "comment_date": "2020-09-04T23:45:26Z", "likes_count": 7}, {"comment_by": "LaughingAdmiral", "comment_text": "Why do you always have to post something so much interesting, I can&#39;t go to sleep, right now!", "comment_date": "2020-09-04T23:43:31Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Andrew Salinas", "comment_text": "Wuold it be pboissle to use mhcinae lnnearig to do error ciceootrrn based on the cneotxt?

This whole &quot;parity check&quot; algorithm reminds me of my favourite puzzle about 1000 barrels of wine. I&#39;ll write it here if someone wants to try solving it:\r<br>\r<br>You are a wealthy king of a prosperous, medieval, absolute monarchy. Your daughter is getting married in 11 days (in the morning on the 12-th day from today). Understandably, to celebrate the occasion you organise a lavish wedding party. The main highlight of the planned event is 1000 kegs of the finest wine from overseas that you ordered. They arrived yesterday and you have been bragging about it to everyone who would listen.\r<br>\r<br>Unfortunately, your spies inform you that your enemies secretly added poison to one of the kegs. The poison is so potent, that but a drop can easily kill a man. However, to avoid suspicion, the substance was chosen carefully. It doesn&#39;t kill instantly - you die after a week (on the 8-th day), showing no symptoms until then. \r<br>\r<br>Obviously you need to find and get rid of the poisoned keg before the wedding. Moreover, you absolutely can&#39;t waste more than 1 keg. You are certainly wealthy enough to afford a whole new batch, but it would certainly not arrive on time. Additionally, if more than 1 keg is missing, someone might notice - it would be a major hit to your prestige, position and rule - after all, as a ruller, perception is everything.\r<br>\r<br>Fortunately, 10 criminals are being held in your dungeon for different crimes pending trial before you. Being a king you can do whatever you want with them - pardon them, kill them or... make them taste the wine.\r<br>\r<br>Your task is simple - you need to find the poisoned keg before the wedding day, but how?\r<br>===========================================================================================\r<br>\r<br>TL;DR - 1000 kegs, 1 poisoned. The poison kills on the 8-th day after ingestion. You have 10 prisoners you can force the wine upon. You need to find the poisoned keg in 11 days.\r<br>\r<br>FAQ: \r<br>-&gt; A poisoned person dies on the 8-th day but NOT TO THE MINUTE. It could be after 7d + 1h or 7d+14h, you don&#39;t know.\r<br>-&gt; There is no way to distinguish the poisoned wine from the normal wine. They smell, look, behave exactly the same.\r<br>-&gt; You have only 11 days &quot;to work with&quot; - you can&#39;t f.ex. check the state of prisoners on the 12-th day, the mystery must solved by then.<br>-&gt; There is no antidote for the poison.\r<br>-&gt; The answer is an algorithm to solve the problem. It&#39;s not something along the lines of &quot;I ask the mage, and he divines it&quot; or &quot;I cancel the party&quot;\r<br>-&gt; From what I hear there is more than one way to solve it, however I only arrived at a single solution<br><br>And I have a small request - if you want to write your solution in the comment, please don&#39;t spoil the fun for others, write it on the 5-th line so that it&#39;s not visible before one clicks &quot;MORE&quot;. <br>Thank you!", "comment_date": "2020-09-04T21:04:02Z", "likes_count": 75}, {"comment_by": "Mister Theguy", "comment_text": "Can anyone explain <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X8jsijhllIA&amp;t=15m45s\">15:45</a>, the zeroth bit, to me?", "comment_date": "2020-09-04T21:01:38Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Dmytro Sorokun", "comment_text": "Awesome!!!!

The square of bits encoding the information is like the square of head/tail coins on the chess board. Like in the riddle, this board encodes a certain position to be where the &quot;key&quot; is, and using the method explained in the solution to the riddle to locate the key position from the board layout, we would know if there is an error or not by making sure if the supposed &quot;key&quot; of the board layout is where it should be. If its not, well we know there was an error, and supposing its only a single error, we can track it down by reversing the riddle solution algorithm to find the bit we have to flip to have the &quot;key&quot; back in its original postion. If you think about it, it would take log base 2 of n amount of redundant bits to mark the location of the key, so a similar amount of redundant bits needed as the hamming code. I guess things get complicated if those redundant bits are where the error is though.
