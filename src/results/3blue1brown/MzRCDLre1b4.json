When sound is reflected in a tube the waves reinforce and cancel each other out. Waves which reflect back and forth in phase, meaning crests (high points) overlap crests and troughs (low points) overlap troughs the wave is reinforced and you have resonance.. This is the way musical instruments work. The same is true for strings, as used in string instruments. Now the tube is also resonant for frequencies that are multiples of the base, or as it is know, fundamental, frequency. So a tube that is resonant at 256 Hz will also be resonant at 512 Hz (2x), 768 Hz (3x), and so on. The resonance is constrained to multiples of the fundamental frequency. Quantized energy works the same way, energy is delivered in discrete steps of hf, 2hf, 3hf, and so on.<br><br>I hate doing this, but the incomplete nature and the rushed explanations at the end force me to give it a thumbs down.

I considered the possibility of harmonics and gave that to me. And therefore was able to make in theory a type of alchemy simplii using different harmonic signals from the nanotechnology to the subatomic particles. The only thing is that when you end up trying to use a frequency to change a frequency you forget but it&#39;s basically impossible to do that. . It&#39;s only possible for you to change something on its base level. Trying to change a frequency word for frequency. Simply adds another frequency to the first frequency. They kind of passed through each other. When using harmonics on a Guitar or piano to change the frequency be by moving around the string. You&#39;re actually changing the tension in and the way that the wave can be presented. To think about that and then try and think about light waves and quantum mechanics. You have to be able to change the actual base reality. Which is not the way particles but instead is the physical space that the particles existed. Like a gravity affecting so-called space-time. But if gravity alone isn&#39;t enough to change a frequency of light from one wavelength to another like a colour to another. Or an amplitude to make it stronger faster. What have you? There has to be according to this Theory at least something real on the base level that all things are actually planted on the virtual string of the universe, which is not the wavy bits of quantum mechanics and subatomic particles, but some other deeper logistic. Pines of paper or string that everything is actually lay on even particles. And photons. I haven&#39;t really heard of anyone talking about the strings of a light beam or what exactly a light beam is oscillating with because even though they are waves they have to be waves of something reacting to something else. Did you simply cannot exist on their own? They have to be something as a reaction like waves in water or ways a long string. If you think about things this way you realize there has to be something greater in the universe smaller or more solid and we just simply do not understand yet. And we haven&#39;t even thought about and we have not ever talked about in quantum theory. Such as the existence of other dimensions I have seen in the so-called polytopes. Do not operate in the way that we see a so-called fourth dimension when you square or cube, you forget about the idea of an extradimensional space.

It&#39;s since the time of Leucippus and Democritus that we know that mater is made of elementary, not divisible, particles. They gave to those particles the name &quot;atom&quot; and we have used that name for something that in reality could be divided in smaller particles. But that does not change the fat that there is a limit to the possibility to break matter. The same is with force and energy, and there is no reason why it shoud be different.<br>Now let&#39;s think to a flow of cars, each car being the atom or the quantum, going along a road and suddenly finding an obstacle. Some of them will go around on the left, some of them on the right, depending by the position of the obstacle. Before cars actually arrive in front of the obstacle, we have no idea which one will go to the left and which one to the right right. It will be the actual presence of the obstable that will force each car to go to the left or to the right. Each car cannot be further divided so X % will go to the left and (100-X) % to the right. The same with photons and a polarizer; some will go through and some will not and we have no idea which one will go and which one will not go.<br>And what is weird in the fact that placing a series of polarizers with small progressive rotations the loss is lo,wer than  the case of two polarizers with a large angle? Even a kid knows that if one wants to redirect a force to another direction it is better to do in small steps. Thee pistons of an engine have a movement up and down. Using rotating equipment, so with a continuous change of the angle, this movement is converted to a rotation or to a left-right movement without any loss apart from the friction. <br>It looks to me like discovering hot water and selling it like a fountain of gold", "comment_date": "2020-01-06T18:43:56Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "dodue-joie", "comment_text": "&quot;Harmonic Mechanics&quot; is more frequently called Cymatics, I believe.

So I don\u2019t know much about quantum physics, but I\u2019ve thought too much about this tonight and I still don\u2019t quite get the problem. In the first video you explain that the polarization of photons through filters is unexplainable in the way that 85% are allowed through the 22.5 degree filter, because you\u2019d expect it to be 25% as that\u2019s the percentage of rotation from 90%. Yet in this video you explicitly state that the probability of the quantum particle (photon) getting through the 22.5 degree filter is the square of the cos(22.5) which is .85.  The photons that pass through both filters are the sum of both filters probabilities of passage, not the probability of passage through the sum of both filter\u2019s angles. Exactly what the experiments show actually get through. How is that so mysterious?  Does the vertical amplitude of the electric field directly dictate the number/percentage of photons that pass through the filter? Or is it that, classically, the presumption is that the frame of reference does not change from a through c?  Again, from what little I understand of quantum physics, the trouble you seem to be describing is that you are incapable of measuring a quantum particle in two separate frames of reference. A frame of reference does not consider acceleration of the particle. Does the direction of the photon\u2019s acceleration not change once it passes through the filter, as it\u2019s a \u201cminimal unit\u201d and must amount to 1 or nothing?  Passing through a filter would inherently change the frame of reference and thusly requires a \u201cnew calculation\u201d to be performed on the subsequent filtering.  It seems to be an issue of operationalizing the order of calculations, rather than a mathematical inconsistency.

What actually happens it the absorption of the light by one of the long crystals adds the energy to the crystal, which then will re-emit the energy, in the polarised direction, which can constructively interfere with the part of the light that gets through, as the new light will be a superposition of the light that passes through and the newly emitted light. This happens because the experiment fires photons at the filters quickly enough that each component of a photon that gets through is being affected by the re-emission of the component of an earlier photon that got absorbed. So while each photon is being treated as a separate experiment, with a separate result, it simply isn&#39;t behaving that way, each experiment is contaminated by the previous experiment... the filter does not &quot;observe&quot;, it temporally shifts. If it didn&#39;t add absorbed light to passed light, then adding the 45 degree filter in between wouldn&#39;t increase the overall light that gets through... it&#39;s not &quot;quantum is just weird&quot;, it is completely intuitive once you account for everything that actually happens, and people MAKE it weird when they do not.", "comment_date": "2019-02-27T07:57:18Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Praetoria", "comment_text": "You&#39;ve probably got this comment before and might not check comments on older videos, but maybe next time you guys do a collaboration you should consider sticking to one background color.

I&#39;m in a superposition where I simultaneously believe and doubt that QM and entanglement is more than a philosophical speculation about gaps in the standard model. I&#39;m skeptical about the lenses, and here is what I found. First, let me say that I really enjoy 3Blue1Brown&#39;s videos. Second, that I&#39;m a curious person and not an expert. Finally, I won&#39;t question the premise of Quantum Mechanics, but I would love to know whether entanglement has ever been proven as a concrete physical phenomenon, or whether it remains a philosophical speculation after-the-fact of some observed result (I&#39;ve read about the Beryllium and Calcium teleport experiments, but it seemed very vague as to whether something actually happened owing exclusively to entanglement). This video and its counterpart which demonstrates the polarized lens effect take a very certain view that light passes straight through a polarized lens with very static results and no real net effect. Is that actually true? Several people seem to believe that light passing through a polarized lens does not behave in this way at all, and suggest that the standard model has a perfectly reasonable explanation--here are my finds:<br><br>From the internet comment peanut gallery:<br><br>&quot;It is critically important that after passing a polarizer the light has a new well defined polarization regardless of what it polarization state was before. That is a property of the light that has been changed. You can express it in a number of ways but you need to understand the change in order to explain how inserting a third polarize can result in light passing through where none had passed before.&quot;<br><br>&quot;As I understand it, a polarized filter does nothing except filter out light--it does not alter the light passing through in any way.&quot; This is not the case.&quot;<br><br>And this other argument, which sounds lazy:<br><br>&quot;A polarized photon can be thought of as being in a mixture of states - when it approaches a polarizer, it&#39;s either parallel or perpendicular (it either passes, or it doesn&#39;t). When you polarize a photon and then immediately &quot;test&quot; it with another polarizer at right angles, you know the state it&#39;s in: it is &quot;perpendicular&quot; to the second polarizer and will be stopped.<br>But when you have another angle, you have a certain probability of passing or not passing. In particular, when you&#39;re coming in polarized at 45\u00b0, there is an equal chance of passing or not passing (it is in a mixture of two states, if you like). So half the photons will pass the second polarizer - and they will come out &quot;rotated&quot;.\r<br>These photons now hit the third polarizer - again, at 45 degrees. Again, you have a 50-50 chance that such a photon is parallel, and is passed on.\r<br>We therefore have a 1 in 4 chance of passing the two polarizers, where before we had none.&quot;<br><br>That all sounds vague.<br><br>From Wikipedia (also potentially a peanut gallery?):<br><br>(This one makes me wonder if introducing all three lenses instead of only one creates a birefringent or biaxial medium for the light. Also, are the camera filter lenses flat?) <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Birefringence#Biaxial_materials\">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Birefringence#Biaxial_materials</a><br><br>But this one seems to suggest that entanglement might be concrete(?) or at least that we don&#39;t currently have a non-QM explanation: <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stern%E2%80%93Gerlach_experiment\">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stern%E2%80%93Gerlach_experiment</a><br><br>Clearly some say the polarization is entirely different once light has been re-emitted from the opposite side of the lens. That alone seems like it would easily explain it but I can&#39;t seem to find that answer definitively. The math here is probably great, and the video definitely offers an interesting look into QM basics(?) for a layman like me. It might make for some fun math opportunities and inspirational advances in computing but does anyone know whether entanglement has been proven?

It could be related to conservation of energy. I have watched your multivariable calculus videos on Khan Academy. I think you said that conservative fields are conservative if and only if they have no curl, but while magnetic and electric fields do have some curl the electromagnetic has to be conservative as a whole. (since all true forces are conservative, but sometimes we approximate some of them as non-conservative. For example, with friction mechanical energy is not really lost, but is given to the molecules that are sliding as heat)<br><br>I won&#39;t be mathematically rigorous since I have just came up with this idea, but I think somehow any curl one of the fields would cause an &quot;unconservativity&quot; that would have to be overcome by a change in the other field, that would only be justified if that &quot;unconservativity&quot; existed.

Well, the level of physics there is high, but not high enough for me to watch.

If you think about other famous people who efficiently popularized physics they all are real physicists! Henri Poincar\u00e9 would probably be my favorite, but someone might like Feynmann or Kapitza more.<br><br>In this topic I can point to something that is not at all clear from the video. Electron have spin +1/2 or -1/2. Photons have circular polarization - spins 1 and -1.<br>1) Hey, it is integer, not half integer! You should have at least mentioned Fermions vs Bosons.<br>2) Spin can change only by an integer number, electrons seem to be fine, but what about photons? Spin 0 photons?!<br>The presented picture is not complete, you should have said at least something about them, but instead you just pretend those do not exist... Something like &quot;spin 0 photons require longitudinal waves and those configurations possible only in a medium&quot; would be enough to calm my brain.<br>In moments like this I feel really good about my degree in theoretical physics because university gives complete picture of modern state of physics.

My web model in 1996 found in 95 here on youtube in 2008 predicted that geometry.  It also predicts the necessity for dual electron masses to explain how atoms work. Infact, electrons don&#39;t run off electron control, but these do take part in a kinetic reaction. <br>Photons don&#39;t actually exist though, they only seem to exist. It is really a continuous series of explosions and implosions of kinetic reactions in a twist that is light. The more the twist the faster the light can travel. It is ion charge modulation, and the poles are each biased to a charge, neg to neg, pos to pos, while matter is actually a 3rd pole in bias to both and not at all. It is a disturbance on a 2d plane building block which begins a vortex. This is why scalinohedronic atoms are the only ones to exist in super heavy elements like 140. Ming dynasty green porcelain has actaully shifted to scalino-hedronic, and is perhaps 50 times tougher than any glass. We know this because there is evidence of it.  The vacuum of space does not really exist anywhere, proving space is and must be kinetic. This was proven in 1955 using electron photography by 2 head professors u of Tx. who toured the country showing off their machine.<br>So ; I suggest it is boson induction geometry which aligns or does not align to induct those kinetic reactions. <br>Boson kinetics would suggest that fano planes break down light as a value beyond superconductivity which has the highest geometry of 8 around 1, which when stacked is 16 around 1, which can get no higher and just becomes more 16 around 1 pairs.  360/16=22.5 .<br>ie; The polarized glass functions with both bosons and electron neutrinos which are the far opposites ultimately responsible for the true lightwave, the kinetic lightwave. The first 3 cycles or so of light may not allow so much light through the 22.5 filter. After 3 or more cycles, things should align due to a natural superconductivity of space itself to light found in what I call format # 3 space, which includes a vacuum, light gasses, and on larger scales , crystal forms which imitate the space but lack the ability to move all waves through due to the 3rd pole matter disturbances.<br>Also the 45d filter allows bosons to twist from start geometry which has stretched out their wave.<br>Now things might get very interesting if you introduce mirrors and prisms for feedback loops.", "comment_date": "2017-10-15T20:46:52Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "The AntiJesus", "comment_text": "This is mostly simple trig.

But once you add filter B in between: The photon hits filter A (0* vs 0* = 100% chance), remains tilted at 0*, then hits filter B (0* vs 45* = 50% chance), becomes tilted at 45*, then hits filter C (45* vs 90* = 50% chance). This is very logical and predictable! I understand that the surprise comes from how the numbers add up, like the expected final result of 25% (50% + 50% chance) not being exactly that... however I don&#39;t see how this means the photon doing something different at filter B based on knowing what it&#39;s going to do at C, as much as I&#39;d love to believe that future -&gt; past time travel and / or conscious observation are playing a key role.", "comment_date": "2017-09-14T23:45:42Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "ChesterSnap", "comment_text": "I now understand what circular polarized light is.

Perhaps this question could be addressed by using coherent microwaves instead of photons, so that the wavelength is long enough to attend to the phase of the E-field at the location of a polarizing filter.", "comment_date": "2017-09-13T16:54:16Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "rigille", "comment_text": "You&#39;re very inspiring, Grant!", "comment_date": "2017-09-13T16:53:51Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Fendula Ratsq", "comment_text": "transfering from black to white background has made this video unwatchable", "comment_date": "2017-09-13T16:49:35Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Eldritch Toilets", "comment_text": "What coincidence, Matt Parker just made a video talking (briefly) about complex numbers!", "comment_date": "2017-09-13T16:40:30Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Florent de Montille", "comment_text": "Great video, even if my mother langage is not english, so i missed some point i think.<br>but we don&#39;t have video of this quality in french...<br>I have a question about the polarized filter, when they absorb the energy of the wave, does they become hotter ?", "comment_date": "2017-09-13T16:40:15Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "JL Software", "comment_text": "<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MzRCDLre1b4&amp;t=5m56s\">5:56</a> you lost me.
