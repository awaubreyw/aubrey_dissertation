So it is the integral domain resulting from factoring the monic polynomial x\u00b2+1 into grade 1 polynomials.<br>Similarly the Eisenstein integers is what you get when you adjoin a primitive 6th root (or 3rd root, since -1 is already present) of 1 to the ordinary integers, closing it up properly.<br>So it is the integral domain resulting from factoring the monic polynomial x\u00b2-x+1 (or x\u00b2+x+1) into grade 1 polynomials.<br><br>Both these integral domains are grade 2 extensions of the integers (thus 2 dimensional geometrically), they are unique factorization domains (so the counting method works without problems of choice), and they are &quot;locally Elliptic&quot; in the sense of having a finite number of units i.e. factors of 1 (unlike the golden integral domain a+b*phi, resulting from the monic polynomial x\u00b2-x-1, which is unique factorization, but &quot;locally Hyperbolic&quot; in the sense of having infinitely many units and thus infinitely many numbers of almost any particular norm, in fact for every norm except 0, we have either no numbers or infinitely many numbers of that norm).<br>Thus we should be able to approximate pi by building circles of ever growing norms in these two integral domains.<br><br>It is an interesting question whether we can find monic polynomials of say degree 3, that when split into grade 1 polynomials (or perhaps only factored into one polynomial of grade 1 and one of grade 2) gives us a unique factorization domain with a finite number of units, corresponding to a 3 dimensional discrete geometry with a cubic norm behaving similarly to the ordinary quadratic norms?<br><br>Another interesting question is whether we can make sense of any particularly well behaved finite section of an integrals domain with infinitely many units, for the purpose of counting area. Like e.g. in the golden integral domain (which is 2 dimensional), phi = (1+5^\u00bd)/2 is of norm -1 since (5^\u00bd)\u00b2 = 5, the conjugate of a+b*5^\u00bd is a-b*5^\u00bd and thus |1/2+5^\u00bd/2| = (1/2+5^\u00bd/2)(1/2-5^\u00bd/2) = (1+5^\u00bd)(1-5^\u00bd)/4 = (1\u00b2-5)/4 = - 4/4 = -1.<br>So in particular phi\u00b2 is of norm 1, thus counting the area of the infinite hyperbola of norm n, for n positive, down to the &quot;hyperbola&quot; of norm 0, we can take all numbers of the form x*(phi\u00b2)^k as &quot;equivalent to&quot; x, since they all have the same norm (say n, if x has norm n), thus the hyperbola is periodic when &quot;rotated&quot; by a multiplication of phi\u00b2, which gives us a similar factor to the factor 4 for Gaussian integers or the factor 6 for Eisenstein integers (or the factor 2 for ordinary integers). Which means we can actually get a sensible finite sum by counting classes of numbers equivalent under multiplication by phi\u00b2. And doing this, we get a new way of approximating some constant for the hyperbola (is it pi or something else?), provided the summation of phi\u00b2 equivalence classes of numbers (golden integers) of norm n, over all positive integer n, divided by the squared radius of the latest hyperbola, actually converges in the usual Archimedean/Euclidean norm i.e. the real number norm.<br><br>Provided this works, we may then tackle the problem of 3d &quot;volumes&quot;/&quot;areas&quot; using not the ordinary quadratic norm, but instead a cubic norm given by a grade 3 monic polynomial, e.g. x\u00b3+x+1, regardless of whether we get infinitely many units (locally Hyperbolic) or finitely many units (locally Elliptic), as long as we have unique factorization.<br>Locally Elliptic here is roughly the same as Euclidean metric, while locally Hyperbolic is roughly the same as Minkowsky metric, although this is only valid for quadratic norms, plus we don&#39;t necessarily get any more numbers of norm 0 even when using a &quot;Minkowsky metric&quot; like norm.<br>One of the beauties of working over rational numbers and integers rather than real numbers, is that there are extensions of dimension larger than 2 that gives rise to fields and integral domains, no pesky zero divisors! Whether this gives us non-convergence in the real norm using infinite sums, and possible convergence in certain p-adic norms, i don&#39;t know.<br><br>It is sure worth a try, to find out what would be a good cubic norm and what would be a good degree 3 conjugation based on the monic polynomial x\u00b3+x+1, provided we split it in 3 grade 1 polynomials. It is obvious that unless it immediately splits into three grades of degree 1 when factoring one out, we will also have three conjugates of degree 2, swapping just two of the roots.<br>Not sure if this always happens over the ordinary integers (the formula for solving the general cubic should give us a hint!), so we would have to use Gaussian or Eisenstein integers as a base integral domain instead, because i think that having a Galois group of order 6 instead of order 3 might be problematic, especially since Sym(3) is non-commutative unlike Sym(2) and Alt(3).<br>I&#39;m sure that we should be able to construct a monic polynomial that gives us a specific version of the general cubic solution, where the term inside the square root sign in the sum within the cube root sign is made into a rational number (or better integer), thus making that grade 2 conjugation invalid, WITHOUT making the whole polynomial reduce into a product of grade 1 polynomials over the rational numbers (or integers), thus giving us the desired property of our monic polynomial&#39;s splitting field being of dimension 3 rather than dimension 2.

Bla bla find the rest.<br><br>However, where does the chi function come from / why is it defined based on multiples of 4? Is it because we&#39;re utilizing the complex plane?<br><br>Edit: I realized that finding the actual lattice points in the complex plane is not important. Lol it&#39;s about finding them and counting them and then finding another way to count them, hence the chi function and the relation of distributing the chi function values of the powers of the prime factors to get chi functions with all divisors of N. Writing this out for all the whole numbers up to N and writing that in a unique way with columns as N goes to infinity. So we want a circle with many many lattice points so this can be set equal to the area formula and find that expression for pi.<br><br>Still..<br>Why is chi defined the way it is based on multiples of 4 or modular arithmetic with remainders 1 and 3?<br>Would it be known that chi would have the multiplicative property when defining it?", "comment_date": "2020-04-21T12:50:10Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Thomas Prince", "comment_text": "<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NaL_Cb42WyY&amp;t=29m01s\">29:01</a> &#39;like this central character chi from our story&#39;... another delightful pun.", "comment_date": "2020-04-20T22:06:52Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Giulia De Simone", "comment_text": "Your videos always amaze me...", "comment_date": "2020-04-18T14:00:16Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "sanket gandhi", "comment_text": "<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NaL_Cb42WyY&amp;t=26m32s\">26:32</a> everything starts to take shape", "comment_date": "2020-04-18T09:08:18Z", "likes_count": 2}, {"comment_by": "JanPBtest", "comment_text": "When did the habit of writing &quot;tan^(-1)&quot; instead of &quot;arctan&quot; started?", "comment_date": "2020-04-17T22:29:45Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Mohammad Faisal", "comment_text": "<a href=\"https://youtu.be/NaL_Cb42WyY?t=35\">https://youtu.be/NaL_Cb42WyY?t=35</a> the expresiions of the students!! too good man, too good!!", "comment_date": "2020-04-12T19:27:01Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Waltz Ng", "comment_text": "Excellent tutorial.

I viewed it instead as you know the formula for the area of a circle is the radius  squared times some constant, and by using complex numbers and number theory, you can find the value of this constant! I view the definition of pi as the infinite alternating sum of the odd reciprocals, not the ratio between a circle&#39;s circumference and diameter, as that is just an emergent property. This change in perspective made me finally appreciate pi.

There is absolutely nothing in this universe that is unrelated to math, and all branches of math that seem so far apart are all actually intimately connected. And this leads me to believe that there is some unified theory of mathematics to uncover. I have not yet seen the quaternion videos, but I assume I might get some more insight into the origins of mathematics itself, and the universe itself, from there. It&#39;s similar to the idea of conservation of energy to me. Is it that the law of conservation of energy comes from all of the sub-laws in our universe (such as Maxwell&#39;s equations or relativity or even newtonian mechanics) or is it that these sub-laws are uniquely born from the singular law of conservation of energy? (Though I don&#39;t think this is true, because I don&#39;t think the laws of our universe are a unique set of potential laws that accomplish that). But at least thinking in this way, I believe, can lead humans ever closer to uncovering the unified theories of the universe. Maybe that knowledge is actually the end to an infinite limit and we can never reach it, but I wouldn&#39;t mind coming arbitrarily close as time ticks on. So with the help of 3B1B, I want to try to uncover the ultimate laws of nature and reality. And maybe if one day humans can finally uncover everything mathematics has to offer, we can move on to try to uncover what gives mathematics existence itself, or where mathematics actually exists at all. Is it within the universe, or somewhere else? How are we under its control, pervasive everywhere you go with no delay, yet it is intangible?

This is one of your best videos to date and using geometry to explain seemingly complex formulas creates the intuition in understanding that these formulas on their own lack. For someone very interested in math who doesnt have alot of prerequisite knowledge on something like formulas for pi. This video takes an individual from going oh thats equals pi because other people say so to it equals pi because were essentially doing something like taking the area of a circle to infinity sequentially by counting the latice points of intersections, noticing a pattern correlating the radius of the circle and its complex factors. Creating a formula for this for any given radius so that we dont literally have to count every point by hand using some number/algebraic theory thrown in to create the formula. And summing this formula to infinity for every integer value of radius. Then divide out the radius to give an infinite sum for our unknown constant PI. And of course because of how complex number factors and how factoring numbers in general work all of this correlates to prime numbers, because we have to factor our radi to get our intersection points.<br><br>Quite possibly ive said some of that wrong or have used the wrong words, but this is mind blowingly genuis, and of course pi would be very elegantly derived this way using complex numbers as complex numbers mathematically are a perfect system for describing two dimensional rotations, and rotations around an origin have everything to do with a circle", "comment_date": "2018-10-06T06:34:46Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Chunye Wang", "comment_text": "AWESOME!

But I see many comments that are not sure if they understood the stary. Here&#39;s another perspective of the same topic without complex numbers:<br>Basically, as a more fundamental approach, choose all unordered pairs of (positive) integers whose squares add up to the number you require. <br>For ex: 25 = {(3,4),(5,0)}<br>Now, since you are squaring them, it wouldn&#39;t matter at all if any of them were negative. So one by one give them negative signs. (Think of it as repeating these numbers in every _quadrant_).<br>So, 25 = {(3,4),(-3,4),(-3,-4),(3,-4),(5,0),(-5,0)}<br>And also remember the fact that addition is commutative. So if you make them ordered, repeatedly interchange them while you&#39;re at it, to get a more exhaustive list.<br>25 = {(3,4),(4,3),(-3,4),(4,-3),(-3,-4),(-4,-3),(3,-4),(-4,3),(5,0),(0,5),(-5,0),(0,-5)}<br>Those are all the lattice points that you&#39;re going to hit. Great! What you did just now was: [multiplied by -1/1 when you gave reflected them in each quadrant, multiplied by i/-i when you interchanged them]<br><br>Of course finding the first unordered pair of positive integers gets harder as you go forward.

I also found it interesting that you showed the multiplication by i as an animated rotation of the vector (2+i) thru an angle of 90 degrees to become the vector (-1+2i)... because if you multiply THAT vector (-1+2i) times (another) i, you get another 90\u00b0 rotation to become the vector (-2 - i)... which is the same result you showed at <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NaL_Cb42WyY&amp;t=9m49s\">9:49</a> (&quot;multiply each factor by negative 1...&quot;+)... because multiplying the original vector times i and then again times i, is (2 + i) * i * i.. which is the same as (2 + i ) * (i * i).. and since (i * i) is defined as -1, then (2 + i) * -1 = (-2 - i), as you said.<br><br>And for those who can&#39;t imagine a real world application for &quot;imaginary&quot; numbers... in electrical engineering, there is a difference between the &quot;watts&quot; of a motor&#39;s output (watts = volts * amps) and the VA &quot;voltamps&quot; of power supplied to it. The watts of shaft work output is almost exactly equal (with a very minor deduction for bearing friction within the motor) to the watts of &quot;real&quot; power consumed by the motor... but unless the motor is perfectly efficient (and none are..) the motor has a &quot;power factor&quot; rating of, say, 90%. In this case, it takes an extra 10% of power to set up the magnetic fields that drive the motor. This 10% isn&#39;t converted to shaft work or resistance heat in the windings, it&#39;s &quot;borrowed&quot; from the power company and &quot;returned&quot; a moment later when the unused portion of the magnetic field collapses. This is called &quot;reactive&quot; power, and it can be thought of as &quot;imaginary&quot; power because it&#39;s merely borrowed and promptly returned. But, the wiring and fuses that supply the motor must carry ALL the power - that which is consumed plus that which is borrowed. So, electrical engineers use &quot;VA&quot; or &quot;KVA&quot; to refer to the combination of real plus imaginary power. And, they graph the imaginary power on an axis which is perpendicular to the &quot;real&quot;  power axis - just like how the imaginary number axis is perpendicular to the real number axis here.", "comment_date": "2017-10-12T04:40:40Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Hamid Sh", "comment_text": "Beautiful...", "comment_date": "2017-10-12T04:26:43Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Andrew Plotner", "comment_text": "This is interesting and it may have some applicability in cracking encryption.

So in some way the summarisation of certain discrete values of a trigonometric function will create a sequence in the context of the above video that will sum up to PI. So trigonometric functions are able to build up Pi. Digging formula collection books will indeed confirm this by the way their sequence for value calculation got build up.<br><br>If you want to belive me now - this all has in the end a very high similarity with what a fourier transformation would look alike: syncing your numeric accumulation window with the 2D vectors or complex surface numeric just to finally (=infinite sumarization) end up with the value of the &quot;frequency&quot; that you were looking for by the special rules you applied to your search/summarization processes.", "comment_date": "2017-08-18T12:05:58Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Acedia", "comment_text": "Didnt understand a single word, still enjoyed it.

A UFD is a ring in which any nonzero element can be factored uniquely as a product of irreducible elements (in general, prime and irreducible elements are different, but in UFDs they happen to coincide). This factorization is unique up to multiplication by a unit. In the Integers, the only units (numbers that can be multiplied by something else to equal 1) are 1 and -1. This is why a factorization is basically the same if you make some of the prime factors negative, because the factorization is unique up to the inclusion of either 1 or -1.

It&#39;s clear how passionate you are about this stuff; your passion and the care you put into these videos an extreme pleasure to watch. The animations are downright astonishing in how well you&#39;ve managed to make all the right visual connections to complement the explanations that you&#39;re giving. Not to mention the extremely high quality of the animations is far above what I&#39;ve seen anywhere else. Your voice is very calming and you speak very clearly in an approachable and inviting way which really helps hit the nail on the head. There&#39;s no question that you understand what you&#39;re saying at a deep level. Really everything is freaking awesome and dead-on.<br><br>I can&#39;t really express the impact you&#39;ve had and are continuing to have on me, especially as of late. I had been passionately studying machine learning over the last few months, putting almost every bit of my free time into reading something about the software or the math involved within. It occurred to me recently that I need to go back to college to learn some of the high-level stuff so I had been specifically studying into basic calculus for the placement test. I was floored when essence of calculus came out, and doubly so when I saw that you&#39;re looking to do a series on probability which is heavily involved in machine learning. This excites me in ways that I haven&#39;t felt before, and has been adding fuel to a deep passion for this stuff. Not to mention other videos like these ones which goes deep into subjects that you definitely wouldn&#39;t expect to see.<br><br>It sounds a bit dramatic and a bit rambley now that I actually type it all out, but I am serious.
