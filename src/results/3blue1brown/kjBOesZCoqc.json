Long time ago when I was an undergrad student (i.e. 2003), not only we had no ample visualized materials, but we couldn&#39;t access the Internet with a reasonable speed (i.e. dial-up connection and not available at our homes). We could solely determine eigenvalues and eigenvectors with no understanding about their meaning whatsoever . The worst came to the worst is that English is not our native language yet English is mandatory at our colleges.  We were good at math because the math calculations doesn&#39;t require a strong linguistic background however, every thing we were good at has been ceased to exist. The reason was the fact that we didn&#39;t have an intuitive explanation about a lot of math materials that helps our memory to remember math concepts for a long time. We&#39;ve wasted a lot of time on carrying out calculations which is supposed to be the task of the computer and forgotten to remember the main picture. My advice to students is that this time being an undergrad student will ever come back again. Learn materials and focus on the big picture and keep some notes for each course.", "comment_date": "2017-11-12T22:35:23Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Tomartyr", "comment_text": "The moment you realise that your maths teachers failed you in ways you don&#39;t fully understand yet.", "comment_date": "2017-11-12T14:29:31Z", "likes_count": 342}, {"comment_by": "Max Leduc", "comment_text": "In the determinant at about 30 seconds, it should be ad-bc I believe.

For example, if I had the matrix [1 2; 3 4] and I want to multiply by the column vector [1; 1], do I need to sit there and slavishly multiply individual entries? No, I interpret [1;1] as 1 of the first column and 1 of the second column in that matrix to arrive at the answer: [3;7]. Even better, multiplying by the vector [1;0] just means &quot;read off the first column of the matrix&quot; and [0;1] means &quot;read off the second column&quot;.

We learned more advanced concepts such as factoring, completing the square, etc. Not once did the teacher say anything to the effect of &quot;a function is a thing you put a number into and get a result out&quot;.
