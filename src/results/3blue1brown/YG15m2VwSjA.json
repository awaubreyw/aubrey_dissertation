I know 3Blue1Brown says any dx raised to the second power and above can be ignored, but why not to the first power (dx itself), or why not dx to the 3rd power, or 5th?

The area increases as you roll out the fabric\u2019s length. But the rate at with area increases depends on not only the rate length increases, but also the magnitude of the width. So the length can be f(x) and the width can be g(x), and the rate of change in length of the fabric can be f\u2019(x) and the static width can be g(x). That\u2019s the first term in the product rule, f\u2019(x)g(x) = rate of change in length times width. Because a fabric roll two yards wide will increase in area quickly as you unroll it, compare to a narrow role of fabric only one foot wide. <br><br>Now a fabric roll only rolls up one direction, so that doesn\u2019t give you the other term I.

For example, If g is too slow (close to constant function), the derivative of fog couldnt be as fast as the old f&#39;(g(x)), but close to zero. On the other hand, if It is too fast, than fog is going to increase faster than the old f&#39;(g(x)) due to the faster rate of change of g. The rate of change changes because we are seeing things relatively with the g values. Imagine we are seeing something in milliseconds running 300 meters during one milliseconds, that is, 300 meters per milliseconds. Now imagine the velocity in  meters per second, that is, 300*1000 meters per second. Turns out that the velocity is 1000 times faster than the old measured velocity in milliseconds.

That makes sense as you explained this in the last video of this series. However, I didn&#39;t understand why `d(sin(x))` would evaluate to `cos(x)dx`, as in why multiply by `dx`, as part of its derivative? In your last video when you explained how the derivative `d(sin(\u03b8))` becomes `cos(\u03b8)`, but there was no mention that it&#39;s also multiplied by dx! A clarification over why the derivative of `d(sin(\u03b8))` is `cos(\u03b8) mutiplied by dx` would be really appreciated. Same question goes for why d(sin(h)) is equivalent to cos(h)dh (i.e. it is multiplied by dh)?

The derivative doesn&#39;t simplify to anything nice, and it might get a bit hard to follow my chain of logic at points. But it&#39;s still a peek into the real world of calculus, and just how ridiculous some calculations can get.<br>Also, math looks horrible in plaintext. Go check out a version I typed out using LaTeX: <a href=\"https://goo.gl/KheXq4\">https://goo.gl/KheXq4</a><br><br>First, we set the variable f equal to the expression given.<br>f = (e^(sin(x))*cos(1/(x^3)+x^3))^4<br>I\u2019m using variables instead of functions because the notation is cleaner, and they\u2019re basically equivalent is this context.<br>If we rewrite f in terms of some other variable g, then we can apply chain rule as follows:<br>df/dx = df/dg * dg/dx, where g = e^(sin(x))*cos(1/(x^3)+x^3)<br>However, the variable g is still rather complex. To properly unpack this expression, we have to work backwards; start by defining g as a very simple function of x, and continue until f has been redefined as a simple function of a variable recursively dependent on several other simple variables. This method gives us the following definitions:<br>g = x^3<br>h = x^3<br>i = 1/h<br>j = i+g<br>k = cos(j)<br>l = sin(x)<br>m = e^l<br>n = m*k<br>f = n^4<br>(I encourage you to check yourself that f still has the same value)<br><br>We can now begin deriving f. As previously mentioned, we can use the chain rule to produce the following:<br>df/dx = df/dn * dn/dx<br>However, the values of both df/dn and dn/dx are currently unknown, so we must evaluate them.<br>Since f = n^4, we can simply use the Power Rule to determine df/dn = 4n^3.<br>n = m*k, so we need to use the Product Rule to determine that dn/dx = m(dk/dx) + k(dm/dx). But we must again determine the values of dk/dx and dm/dx.<br>Continuing this method returns the following:<br>dk/dx = dk/dj * dj/dx<br>dk/dj = -sin(j)<br>dj/dx = di/dx + dg/dx<br>di/dx = di/dh * dh/dx<br>di/dh = -1/(h^2)<br>dh/dx = 3x^2<br>dg/dx = 3x^2<br>dm/dx = dm/dl * dl/dx<br>dm/dl = e^l<br>dl/dx = cos(x)<br><br>And with this, the calculus is done. Everything else we need to do are parts of algebra; namely, substitution and simplification. However, these steps are where mistakes can most easily sneak in, and are also where our equation begins to look very messy indeed. If you&#39;re doing this sort of thing yourself, make sure you double check everything, and don\u2019t be afraid of using too many parentheses!<br>Anyway, we currently have many variables in terms of other variables, but we want to end up with df/dx written in terms of x. To do this, we will substitute all other variables to be written in terms of x.<br>dm/dl = e^(sin(x))<br>dm/dx = e^(sin(x))*cos(x)<br>di/dh = -1/((x^3)^2)<br>di/dx = -1/((x^3)^2)*3x^2<br>dj/dx = -1/((x^3)^2)*3x^2+3x^2<br>dk/dj = -sin(1/(x^3)+x^3)<br>dk/dx = -sin(1/x^3)+x^3)*(-1/((x^3)^2)*3x^2+3x^2)<br>dn/dx = (e^(sin(x))*-sin(1/(x^3)+x^3)*(-1/((x^3)^2)*3x^2+3x^2))+(cos(1/(x^3)+x^3)*(e^(sin(x))*cos(x)))<br>df/dn = 4(e^(sin(x))*cos(1/(x^3)+x^3))^3<br>df/dx = 4(e^(sin(x))*cos(1/(x^3)+x^3))^3*(e^(sin(x))*(-sin(1/(x^3)+x^3)*(-1/((x^3)^2)*3x^2+3x^2))+(cos(1/(x^3)+x^3)*(e^(sin(x))*cos(x))))<br>By getting rid of extraneous parentheses and unneeded marks, performing some simple operations, and reordering a few terms, this turns into<br>df/dx = 4(e^(sin(x))cos(x^3+1/(x^3)))^3(e^(sin(x))cos(x)cos(x^3+1/(x^3))-e^(sin(x))sin(x^3+1/(x^3))(3x^2-(3x^2)/(x^6)))<br>Using the Distributive Property, this becomes<br>df/dx = 4(e^(sin(x)))^3(cos(x^3+1/(x^3)))^3e^(sin(x))(cos(x)cos(x^3+1/(x^3))-sin(x^3+1/(x^3))3(x^2-1/(x^4)))<br>Finally, rearranging and combining like terms, this simplifies to<br>df/dx = 4e^(4sin(x))cos^3(x^3+1/(x^3))(cos(x)cos(x^3+1/(x^3))-3sin(x^3+1/(x^3))(x^2-1/(x^4)))", "comment_date": "2018-01-21T02:50:59Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Alex Couture", "comment_text": "Beautiful", "comment_date": "2018-01-19T05:06:24Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Holobrine", "comment_text": "Multiplying by a constant can be thought of as an extension of the sum rule.", "comment_date": "2018-01-16T20:59:13Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Alex Brown", "comment_text": "I came", "comment_date": "2018-01-08T20:01:13Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Paul Carson", "comment_text": "Wonderful animation.

So if anyone could help me with this that would be awesome. I think of derivatives as a very tiny rise/run, so for x^2 dy/dx =d(x^2)/dx = 2x. So d(sin(h))/dh = Cos(h) and then you multiplied by dh on both sides to get d(sin(h))=cos(h)*dh?? What does this multiplication of dx or dh actually mean? You multiply by the tiny nudge in x? Why do you do that? I&#39;ve never cared about dx when doing derivatives, or written it on the same side of the equal sign as the derivative. Although when I think of it I do multiply by dx doing substitution for integrals. I guess it&#39;s related. I do know how to get the formula through the definiton of the derivative, but I guess I need to think deeper about stuff.  Thanks for the lovely videos. Very helpful.

That is, if you zoom in really close to (y,g(y)), the function looks just like the function x-&gt;Sx+g(y) (the line of slope S through g(y)).<br><br>So it is easy to see what d(g(f(x)))/dx should be: Locally, an increase in g by a small dy should be like following the slope S up dy, so a change of S.dy. And a small change in x changes f(x) by df(x)/dx by definition. So g(f(x)) changes by about S.df/dx. That is, d(g(f(x)))/dx = [dg(f(x))/dx].[df(x)/dx].<br><br>A silly example: a rocket ship travels g(x) miles if you put x amount of rocket fuel in it. So dg(x)/dx measures how much further it travels with an increase of fuel. It can hold f(t) fuel, where t measures the length of time allocated to fill the tank (or whatever...). So d(g(f(t)))/dt measures how much further that ship travels as you wait longer fuelling. Of course, that&#39;s the measure of how much g increases as you increase the amount of fuel (dg(f(x))/dx) multiplied by the rate of increase of fuel (df(x)/dx).<br><br>Not that the chain rule is difficult, but I think this viewpoint makes it easier to visualise the chain rule for functions of more variables.", "comment_date": "2017-05-01T23:28:17Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Stef Linden", "comment_text": "DO one of these for trig", "comment_date": "2017-05-01T23:19:08Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "morethejamesx39", "comment_text": "You always make these videos at perfect times for me", "comment_date": "2017-05-01T23:15:11Z", "likes_count": 3}, {"comment_by": "belg4mit", "comment_text": "This series is awesome.
