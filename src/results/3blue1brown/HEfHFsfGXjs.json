Repeat by setting the right box to 100 kg; 10,000 kg; 1,000,000 kg ..., etc. We have: Set the right box to 1 kg and count the collisions: there are 3 Set the right box to 100 kg and count the collisions: there are 31 Set the right box to 10,000 kg and count the collisions: there are 314 Set the right box to 1,000,000 kg and count the collisions: there are 3141 Each time you increase the right box by 100x, you generate an additional digit of pi. /", "comment_date": "2021-12-20T07:26:22Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "\u116e\u110b\uc6b0", "comment_text": "Thank you", "comment_date": "2021-12-18T16:39:33Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "NO NAME", "comment_text": "I tried in desmos and it didn&#39;t work :(", "comment_date": "2021-12-16T00:48:35Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "mightymegabean", "comment_text": "<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HEfHFsfGXjs&amp;t=1m41s\">1:41</a> My door when I want a midnight snack", "comment_date": "2021-12-14T20:53:51Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Prismatic Falcon", "comment_text": "I realized it was PI but why is a good question.", "comment_date": "2021-12-13T00:02:39Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "ork", "comment_text": "buiosness", "comment_date": "2021-12-10T19:07:53Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Brantley", "comment_text": "What is this called", "comment_date": "2021-12-10T04:08:03Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "RJBizZ", "comment_text": "WHAT IS THE WEBSITE TO GET THAT", "comment_date": "2021-12-07T02:54:17Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "U Perm", "comment_text": "why did this blow up on tik tok", "comment_date": "2021-12-06T22:10:36Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "sitraka forler", "comment_text": "lol it&#39;s awesome!", "comment_date": "2021-12-06T14:23:29Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Ankan M\u00e4gi", "comment_text": "Why does the 10000 kg one sound like that one Terraria song in slow mo", "comment_date": "2021-12-06T12:08:47Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "RSK2019future", "comment_text": "At around <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HEfHFsfGXjs&amp;t=2m25s\">2:25</a>, if you pay attention, the yellow pi has a small neutral expression on it\u2019s face, and is blinking.", "comment_date": "2021-12-06T06:54:17Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "TRFrkan Cn", "comment_text": "This event is intuitive, so we can say that the number pi is intuitive, since we will never be able to reduce friction to zero.

Hence, plus additional dimensions improves analytic ability.  So continuous seems to encompass discrete/discontinuous, so maybe that continue analytical method has advantages over just &quot;matching&quot; discrete/discontinuous math.

AND when it is further than 300 units from the middle object(the nucleus) it was told to stay within limits with it&#39;s gravitational push.(Because electrons don&#39;t like eachother, they are trying to get away from eachother to reach energy minimum) so when i applied this &quot;gravitational push&quot; what got into my mind &quot;okay this simulates electrons to f14 well enough, now what if i tried put in enormous amounts of them?&quot;<br>I put in about 50 then 100 then 150 and even at 150 it pushed out some. and then at about 124 it pushed out the others too.<br>After i changed my method on the programming the push out stopped, BUT they stayed in the middle.... covering the nucleus...

It is like the light bouncing in two mirrors with a small angle. The bouncing times is exactly pi/angle.  The hard part is to figure out the link to the original collision problem. I have a guess. We need to look into the horizontal component and verticals component of the light bouncing through the mirror. The horizontal component is the M part energy and the vertical component is the m part energy. They add up to a constant, which is the light speed. The upper mirror reflects the collision between M and m parts and lower reflects the m collide the wall. Need to further verify this guess. The tan(angle) should be the mass ratio, which is M/m. <br><br>One special case is M=m, which the angle is 45 degree. The light bounces with only horizontal speed (only M is moving) to vertical speed (only m is moving) and vertical reverse (only m is moving) and finally horizontal reverse (only M is moving). <br>If this is true, the number of collisions is pi/arctan(m/M).", "comment_date": "2019-01-15T04:32:22Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Dave Musgrave", "comment_text": "There is some profound property of the universe here - I\u2019m just too traditional to be able to see it.

Specifically say m2 is the heavier block, if you rescale the momentum variable p1 and p2 by sqrt{m}, then you have a very nice circle equation. The entire process amounts to turning by angle pi from the point (p1,p2)=(0,1) to (0,-1) so that the heavier block is reflected.<br><br>Every collision between the two blocks can be written down as a mapping between points on the circle in the phase space(ie old momentum determining new momentum completely, while obeying energy conservation so staying on the circle). Every collision at the wall serves to reflect the point about the p2 axis so that the direction of p1 is flipped. Every step leaves a point on the circle, and each point corresponds to a click sound. So the total number of points on the circle(minus the starting point) is the same as the total number of clicks heard.<br><br>Since all collisions between two blocks is followed by a collision at the wall, we can consider these two events forming a single step. It turns out that as the ratio r=m1/m2 gets smaller, this step approaches an infinitesimal rotation generator, with each step\u2019s rotation angle being 2sqrt{r}. If we let k to be the number of rotation steps to execute the full pi angle rotation from (1,0) to (0,1), then 2sqrt{r}=\\pi/k, or 2k=\\pi/\\sqrt{r}. We identify 2k as the total number of points on the circle(involving both the rotation and the reflection, thats why there\u2019s a factor of 2), then if sqrt{r} is 10^-2n, we have 2k=\\pi * 10^n, which is exactly what we have. <br><br>The only thing left is the round off but I need my beauty sleep now XD.

If we eliminate all equal factors, we get v1^2+v2^2=1. That happens to be the equation for the unit circle. To put it in another way, the solution can be thought of as a vector (v1, v2) satisfies the equation above only for points on the unit circle. Let&#39;s call that vector V for simplicity. For equal weights and a situation where v1=1, v2=0 at t=0, we get the following three events. Initially V=(1,0), at the first bounce, all energy is transfered to the particle p2, so V=(0,1). FInally all energy is transferred back to p1, so V=(-1,0). If we plot these solutions on the unit circle, we&#39;ll see that the vector completes half a turn around the circle, or pi radians. So there&#39;s our pi! But what if m1 != m2? We can fix that by squishing or stretching one of the axes. In other words, we transform to a new coordinate system where the world looks as if the masses were equal. Let&#39;s call the squishification factor c. From the equation of the ellipse, we can scale one of the velocities (say, v1) c, such that v1&#39;=v1*sqrt(m2/m1), or c=sqrt(m2/m1). This follows from the equation of the ellipse. Using this coordinate transformation, we can still pretend that the masses are equal and get valid solutions in our new, transformed coordinate system. The side effect of this factor is that it also grows the radius (and thereby circumference) of the unit circle by c in the transformed coordinate system. This means that if c is an even power of 10, the circumference traced out by the bounces will be pi multiplied by a power of ten. We&#39;re almost there. Let&#39;s set r = m2/m1. Then c=sqrt(r). So if r is an even power of 100, the result of the square root must be an even power of ten, which makes us trace out pi*10^n, which gives some decimals of pi as an integer. Not a rigid proof and I gloss over some stuff. I&#39;ve forgotten my linear algebra, but I think what I&#39;m doing is really to juggle a bunch of eigen-stuff.

Can&#39;t wait to see 3b1b put it a lot more elegantly, though.<br><br>Basically my first thought was to find which values for the initially-moving cube&#39;s mass corresponded with a jump in the number of collisions. I wrote some code and used a few other tricks to help me find the pattern. Here&#39;s a bit of what my program spits out:<br><br>0.0 : 2\r<br>0.3333333333333333 : 3\r<br>1.0 : 4\r<br>1.8944271909999157 : 5\r<br>3.0 : 6\r<br>4.311941110422726 : 7\r<br>5.82842712474619 : 8\r<br>7.548632170413038 : 9\r<br>9.472135954999573 : 10<br>...<br><br>And that&#39;s basically saying, if the mass of the moving cube is more than the left number (but less than or equal to the next left number) the number on the right is the number of collisions you&#39;d expect. So for example, if the mass is 1.5, we look at these two lines:<br><br>1.0 : 4\r<br>1.8944271909999157 : 5\r<br><br>...and since 1.5 is more than 1.0 but less than 1.8944271909999157, there will be 4 collisions.<br><br>The key was figuring out that the function that describes these values is cot(pi/N)^2. So, if the mass is greater than cot(pi/N)^2, but less than or equal to cot(pi/(N+1))^2, there will be N collisions. So for example, cot(pi/5)^2 = 1.8944271909999157..., which fits with the list I showed you above.<br><br>Messing around, you can find that when k is some integer and N is floor(10^k * pi), cot(pi/N)^2 is just under 10^(2k), and when N is 1 +  floor(10^k * pi), cot(pi/N)^2 is just over 10^(2k). So whenever we have a mass of 10^(2k), we should get N = floor(10^k * pi) bounces, which is just the first k+1 digits of pi.<br><br>I didn&#39;t find a neat geometric way to observe a circle hidden in this problem, but it becomes a little more obvious that the circle is in there somewhere once you see that the function behind all this is cot(pi/N)^2.

There is a different way to look at this problem. Assume the velocity with which the initial block was approaching to be 1m/s. We are assuming the velocity cause this initial velocity will only have a scaling effect on the size of the ellipse only. Now, the ellipse about which I just said comes from the energy conservation equations, which will be m_1v1^2 + m_2v2^2 = m_2, just said assuming initial velocity is 1m/s and I just removed the 1/2s from all side. Now we got an ellipse with major axis = sqrt(m_2/m_1) and minor axis = 1. We can consider this ellipse as an energy ellipse, cause for this system to work, all the collisions must occur on the ellipse. Now from the conservation of linear momentum, we got an equation of a line, m_1v_1 + m_2*v_2 = m_2, if we draw this line of slope -m_1/m_2 on the ellipse, we would get two points of intersections, (0,v) &amp; (v_11, v_21), out of which one is the initial state and one is the &quot;after collision among themselves&quot; state, AND, from that state the second collision with the wall takes place, which changes the sign of the velocity of m_1, which gives rise to a 3rd state on the energy ellipse which would be (-v_11,v_21) state, then again a line of slope -m_1/m_2 is made to get the 4th point on the ellipse. And this process continues until we reach the bottom most part of the ellipse, cause after that, the m_1 and m_2 won&#39;t meet. Now if draw the lines inside the ellipses, joining the lines with respect to the events, (0,v) ---collision1--&gt; (v_11,v_21) ---collision2--&gt; (-v_11,v_21) and continue then the number of lines we are getting are nothing but equals to the total number of collisions.

Upon first look, it seems to be a dot bouncing on a 2-d plane, but the problem is 1-d, so what are the x and y-axis representing? A reasonable guess would be they are the location of the two cubes respectively. Then the collision would be when the two cubes reach the same location, x=y, However, the angle shown in the animation is much smaller than 45 deg. <br><br>Considering we are using conservation of energy as the basis of the collision, plot the x and y-axis as the location times the square root of the mass of each cube instead - sqrt(m)*d. In that case, the collision would be happening at where d1=d2, which means y/sqrt(m1)=x/sqrt(m2).  That would be the slanted line shown in the animation. In this case, the speed of the dot in x and y directions would then be the speed of the cubes times the sqrt of the mass. Thus the norm of this vector would be (twice) the total kinetic energy of both cubes. Since energy is conserved in each collision, the norm of the velocity vector must be constant.<br><br>When the smaller cube collides with the wall, it would reverse speed while the bigger cube is unaffected. It would seem like the dot bounced off the x-axis in the planed we constructed. A collision of the cubes is constituted by two principles: conservation of energy and conservation of momentum. Conservation of energy means the speed of the dot is constant. Conservation of momentum means m1*v1+m2*v2 is constant. Considering the way we are plotting the plane, it means that sqrt(m1)*v_y+sqrt(m2)*v_x is constant. We can write that in vector product form: (sqrt(m1),sqrt(m2))*(v_y,v_x). So the projection of the speed onto the slanted line is also constant. That can only mean that the velocity is deflected on the line. (Actually, there are two possible solutions, the other being that the velocity did not change. A quick sanity check tells us the cubes did not phase through each other, so that&#39;s not an actual solution.<br><br>Now that we&#39;ve established the collision of two cubes in 1-d can be represented by the collision of one dot in 2-d. The rest is to just unfold the movement based on symmetry. That would look like the dot that&#39;s moving in a straight line in the animation. The angle of the line is arctan(sqrt(m1/m2)). When m1 is much smaller than m2, that just approaches sqrt(m1/m2). So the number of collisions is pi/sqrt(m1/m2).<br><br>This not very intuitive, considering the x and y-axis don&#39;t seem to have real physical meaning. There might be some points that I&#39;m missing. It also does not translate to a more general case where energy is not conserved.
