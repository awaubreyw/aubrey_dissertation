Since the result depends entirely on the definition of the problem: the question should just simply be &quot;what is the average area of a shadow of a cube&quot;. Averages can be generalized as adding the biggest and smallest numbers then dividing by the number of numbers. Bob and Alice did this and have proofs but they are wrong because they didnt think about the number of orientations. They only considered the min/max of a side and both came up with 1/2 the area of a side as the answer. WRONG<br><br>To be accurate: the 6 sides with the area of 1 oriented up are the minimum orientations = 6. The 8 corners oriented up are the maximums 8x sq root of 3. the total is 19.8564065.... divided by the 14 min/max orientations the answer is 1.418314747182216. <br><br>To be more complex but more accurate, we can graph the sides&#39; shadow areas and come up with parabolas then convert the analog wave to digital. We technically only need to measure 3 sides so there will be 3 parabolas. There are 3 planes of movement. To ensure we get every possible combination, we just start with 1 side in a fixed angle so its shadow remains the same # while the other 2 rotate. their sides will be proportionate to each other since as one gets larger, moving to its next digit, the other must get shorter. That means, at any angle, two sides will have the same range of values. Then we move the first side by one digit and repeat. All sides will have the same min/max values over their range and the totals will fall within the cubes expected min/max. So we come back to my original answer. <br><br>It would be incorrect to calculate the sides independently and draw a conclusion about the cube since sides only have 4 minimum shade orientations and 4 maximums.

I conceptualized the problem the Alice way in the beginning, but I wasn&#39;t convinced by the idea that you could just look at the faces independently. So I approached the problem by coloring the cube&#39;s faces in 3 colors (red, green, blue) such that opposite sides have the same color. Now the whole shadow will always be made up of the shadows of exactly one face of each color. Then you can constrict the problem such that only the upper three faces are considered without losing generality (ignoring edge cases). So the z-components of each normal vector are always positive. Let z1 be the z-component of the red face&#39;s normal vector. We know that z1 is evenly distributed between 0 and 1. There is a range of 90\u00b0 for the cube&#39;s rotation around red&#39;s normal vector such that the green and blue faces remain on top. So we can calculate the z-components of the remaining normal vectors as<br>   z2 = sqrt(1 - z1^2) * cos(a)   and   z3 = sqrt(1 - z1^2) * sin(a)<br>for some angle a that is evenly distributed between 0 and pi/2. Calculating the expected value of z1 + z2 + z3 (which is the expected shadow area) involves a double integral that looks quite scary at first, but is actually pretty simple and allows you the satisfaction of multiplying pi/4 with 4/pi. I was surprised when the result turned out to be 3/2, but after watching this video I understand why it works that way. (But I wouldn&#39;t have understood the Alice method without my work on the Bob way.)", "comment_date": "2022-02-23T19:43:36Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Tricion", "comment_text": "math 2.0", "comment_date": "2022-02-23T11:19:32Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Benji- o", "comment_text": "you hate fun and also challenge too....... i dont like u because of thta boo (i juts added that too rhyme, lol)", "comment_date": "2022-02-23T01:55:23Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "VitruvianSasquatch", "comment_text": "It&#39;s worth point out that Bob does get an insight by calculating early - that the rotation around the normal doesn&#39;t affect the result.

Felt very good when the correct formula was revealed and I was right considering a lot of what you were talking about was different from what I did.<br><br>If you take a single face of the cube and figure out maximum and minimum surface area (SA) that it can have as a projection you end up with 0 at the minimum and SA at the maximum. We don&#39;t need to consider any orientation of the square between these 2 values since we know the distribution of those values is even. If you add 0 and SA together you just get SA and you divide by 2 to get the average. That gets us SA/2 as the formula for any arbitrarily face of the cube.<br><br>To figure out how the actual faces relate to the full cube you have to consider what it would mean to have a shadow. The light in this example doesn&#39;t come from a point, it comes from a plane. The light is the normal of a &quot;light plane&quot; so to speak and if the normal of a face on the cube will intersect with the light plane then it is receiving light and will cast a shadow. Additionally for any given face on a cube there exists another face where the sum of these 2 faces&#39; normals is zero. This means that for any face that we can say is &quot;in the light&quot; we know for sure there is a corresponding face &quot;in the shadows&quot; and any face in the shadows is one where we can ignore it&#39;s area when figuring the total projected area of the cube. With all this in mind the maximum number of faces that can receive light at any time is 3. If 4 faces were receiving light then 4 would have to be in shadow and that&#39;s more faces than a cube actually has, values less than 3 are perfectly fine so long as the at least one face is receiving light. If no faces are receiving light then you need to turn the light back on :Y<br>To put all that in a different way: you only need information about 3 of the faces on the cube to figure out the area of the shadow. In the case of a face where the normal is perpendicular to the light plane&#39;s normal you would get a projected area of zero but since the average area we figured out earlier goes from 0 to SA these faces with a projected area of zero are perfectly valid faces to use for determining the projected area.<br><br>Since we know how to compute the surface area for an arbitrary face: SA/2, we can easily figure out a formula where any given projection is made up of 3 of these arbitrary faces: 3 * (SA/2) which works out to 3/2 * SA.<br><br>So that&#39;s how I got 3/2 * SA, which is different from either approach shown here.

We can cancel the 2 and get that the average shadow area of the cube is 3 times the average area of a single face.<br>Now we can look at the average area of a single face. The area is completely determined by the angle \u03b8 of the normal vector. Now my probability distribution is a uniform distribution of the angle \u03b8 from 0 to \u03c0/2 (to \u03c0 wouldn&#39;t make any difference, the factor of 2 would cancel later on).<br>Then we can take the average of cos(x) from 0 to \u03c0/2. This is given by the integral of cos(x) dx from 0 to \u03c0/2 all over the length we integrate over, in this case \u03c0/2-0=\u03c0/2.<br>The integral of cos(x) dx is of course sin(x)|(\u03c0/2, 0)= sin(\u03c0/2)-sin(0)=1.<br>Therefore the average area is 1/(\u03c0/2)=2/\u03c0.<br>Now multiply that with 3 and you get 6/\u03c0 as the average area of the shadow of the cube.", "comment_date": "2022-01-22T11:24:10Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Yuval Sela", "comment_text": "and theyre transhet.", "comment_date": "2022-01-22T10:32:16Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Jayden Thomas", "comment_text": "Why the hell is this on my recommended\ud83d\udc80", "comment_date": "2022-01-22T04:13:21Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "The Mushroom Colonel", "comment_text": "Thank you so much for your work!

Hope you enjoy :)<br><br>\r<br>1 - Imagine the cube standing in the Euclidean 3D space, and imagine a physical sphere of radius R (where R &gt;&gt; 1) whose center coincides with the center of the cube. Further assume that the sphere carries an overall electrical charge of 1C, uniformly distributed over the surface of the sphere.\r<br>\r<br>2 - Now, look at some differential area da on the sphere. It generates an electrical flux dF through the surface of the cube. Obviously, since the cube lies inside the sphere, it contains no charge and dF=0. But we can further decompose:\r<br>\r<br>dF = dF_in + dF_out = 0\r<br>\r<br>When dF_in is the positive contribution to the flux (entering the cube), and dF_out stands for the negative contribution to the flux (exiting from the cube).\r<br>\r<br>3 - There is another symmetry to account for: for each differential area da around some point x on the sphere, we can associate the differential area da&#39; around the antipodal point -x also lying on the sphere. Denote by dF and dF&#39; the corresponding contributions to the flux. From the problem&#39;s symmetry we get:\r<br>\r<br>dF_in = dF&#39;_in and dF_out = dF&#39;_out\r<br>\r<br>4 - If we move a differential charge dQ from the sphere to the inside of the cube, its contribution to the flux jumps from dF_in + dF_out = 0 to -dF_in + dF_out = -2 * dF_in\r<br>\r<br>5 - Now, using (3) and (4 ) and Integrating the flux over the whole sphere and moving the overall charge inside the cube, we get the following relationship between the total flux after the shift, and the total incoming flux before the shift:\r<br>\r<br>|F_shifted| = 4 * |F_in|\r<br>\r<br>Now we can let the magic happen:\r<br>\r<br>6 - From Gauss Law, we get:\r<br>\r<br>|F_shifted| = 1\r<br>\r<br>7 - ...But taking R to infinity, and using the definition of the flux, it&#39;s quite obvious that |F_in| (up to some irrelevant physical constant) is exactly the averaged normalized shadow area of the cube!!!\r<br>\r<br>Indeed you can think of each differential dF_in generated by a charge at some point x on the sphere as the relative contribution to the averaged shadow associated with the angular position of x relative to the cube&#39;s center.\r<br>\r<br>8 - Therefore,\r<br>\r<br>E(S(shadow)) / S(cube) = |F_in| = 1/4 * |F_shifted| = 1/4\r<br>\r<br>as expected.\r<br>\r<br>Besides requiring no integration and giving a good intuition for the final 1/4 factor,  this proof technique also generalizes to <b>any</b> orientable 2D surface (say a n-holes torus) since Gauss Law doesn&#39;t care about the the fundamental group of the enclosed surface.

The triangle inequality: It&#39;s easy to see that for any real numbers x,y, we have |x|+|y| \u2265 |x+y| (there are two cases, if they have the same sign or they have opposite signs). Now if I have a vector v in the plane, and P is the projection to a line in a random direction, then the average length of Pv must be c|v| for some proportionality constant c. On the other hand, if I have two vectors v,w in the plane, we have |Pv|+|Pw| \u2265 |Pv+Pw| = |P(v+w)| for all projections P (by the real number case). Hence taking expected values on both sides, we get c|v|+c|w| \u2265 c|v+w|, so |v|+|w| \u2265 |v+w|, which is exactly the triangle inequality for vectors.<br><br>2.

Toss a straight needle of length 1 onto the floor; what is the probability that it lands on a line?&quot;<br>- This probability is the same as the expected number of times that the needle crosses a line.<br>- Now replace the shape of the needle with any polygonal path; note that the expected number above is just proportional to the length of the needle, independent of its shape.<br>- To find the proportionality constant, consider a needle in the shape of a circle with diameter 1 (which has circumference pi). Then it (almost) always crosses the lines in exactly two points. Hence the proportionality constant is 2/pi.

I will always watch your videos, and I will always love the relaxation and peace that comes with doing endless calculations to test an idea.

There is also an eerie similarity in the world of programming. For many of us, we seek to optimize our code in the best way possible (some methods choose to be as simple yet as explicit as possible, whilst others seek to abstract as much away such that the final code is more similar to pseudo code). Finally, the different methods almost appear as INTJ vs INTP where one approach seeks to use proven methods and calculates until an intuitive answer is reached whereas the other method is to seek intuition from within and find patterns in such a way that an answer reached organically. Both methods are required in math/programming, imo. Bobs method more so than Alice in terms of training yourself and experimentation. Alice\u2019s approach is needed to push yourself to gain better insight into the problem.

In it he mentions that there are two ways that people often view mathematics. One is as a collection of separate tricks to use on a series of specific problems. Trick A is for Problem A, Trick B is for Problem B, and so on. In this way school can become a routine of &#39;learn tricks for a week - use tricks on a test - forget most tricks quickly.&#39; The tricks get forgotten quickly because there are so many of them and also because the students don&#39;t see how these &#39;tricks&#39; are just extensions of a few basic principles.<br><br>The other way to see mathematics is to realize that all of these &#39;tricks&#39; stem from several basic, but fundamental principles and ideas. And mathematics is then an exploration of where you can get from these same guiding ideas. In this way mathematics isn&#39;t a disconnected bag of magic tricks, but rather a connected web to be explored. As Rusczyk points out, &quot;the successful mathemati cian possesses fewer tools, but knows how to apply them to a much broader range of problems.&quot;<br><br>For instance, Alice&#39;s approach in this video can be seen in a nutshell as a creative application of linearity of expectation. The mathematical techniques used are all elementary, and someone who&#39;s taken a first course in probability/stats might have learnt linearity of expectation though maybe not thought deeply about its possible implications. Further, Alice&#39;s approach as a whole isn&#39;t just an isolate trick in itself.

The next time you see it, it&#39;s a technique.&quot; A lot of neat or cool or slick ideas that you might see in mathematics do have generalizations and connections to other related results in mathematics.

But if you orient the whole object according to R, the faces don&#39;t all start flat on the ground -- face i has an initial rotation Rf[i] representing its position in the shape. So the appropriate weight to use for R with face i is actually P(R * Rf[i]). Since Rf[i] can be anything for a general shape, for these two choices of weighting to give the same result we need the probability distribution to be invariant under an arbitrary 3D rotation.

Knowing it would fail in closer to one use than 100 uses is enough certainty to disregard the concept without doing any math or experimentation. But the logic used informs the factors which future material choices need to consider and what the tacit operational requirements of the product may be beyond those explicitly stated.

This has to be my favorite 3B1B video ever.\r<br>\r<br>I love the discussion on the &quot;tug-of-war&quot; between intuition and calculation. Whenever I approach a generalizable problem, it is true that I often try to step back and try to spot an intuitive pattern before diving deep into the details. It helps to have an initial intuitive impression as a guide before you start. However, intuition, when not built on a strong foundation, could lead to a trap. It is possible that I might have missed a key assumption, or misinterpreted a concept that is central to the problem. I most often detect the error on intuition once I am in the middle of the dirty calculations, which might have had led me to a formula that does not make sense, or to some other false mathematical statement. It is rare that my intuition led me straight to a smooth solution. And if it does, it&#39;s almost always the case that I have done similar problems in the past already, such as hidden angle-hunting in a high school geometry problem, or a seemingly complex integral solved using an &quot;obvious&quot; substitution which I might have never thought of when I was first studying calculus.\r<br>\r<br>Thus, relying on intuition indeed requires slick and stylish creativity, but also a great deal of luck and experience. Intuition isn&#39;t born; it is made. Through piles and piles of crumpled papers and boxed equations and messy notes. Calculation is the tool you use to build your craft.

Qualitative methods often employ this method called grounded theory, whereby researchers sift through data to find contradictions to currently established theories. Social sciences rely on the fact that inductive logics require abductive analyses to generate new information. As we update theories using this grounded approach, our theories converge upon universal and general realities, allowing for us to see, describe, and make predictions about society.<br><br>It&#39;s fascinating because Alice&#39;s intuitions genuinely build new math, but Bob&#39;s experience allows for him to have to build those intuitions. In qualitative research, Alice&#39;s intuition would allow for her to abductively identify a contradiction with theory, refining her puzzling until she revises the contradiction.

Personally, my approach to this problem is more like Alice&#39;s, but starting from the opposite direction. Without going into a 40-minute description, here is a brief summary:  Thinking that the rotations of a cube cast complicated shadows, I began by considering a simpler case: a sphere.  This of course casts a circular shape regardless of rotation, so the average shadow is the only shadow, thereby eliminating the need to consider the rotation at all.  Then, observe that a sphere inscribed inside a cube, or any convex polyhedra, will have a smaller shadow than the cube. Likewise, a sphere circumscribed around the cube will have a larger shadow than the cube.  So these two spheres form lower and upper bounds on the average shadow, and the closer the polyhedra is to a sphere, the closer the shadows of the two spheres will be to the average shadow of the polyhedra. Notice also that rotations of any fixed point on the polyhedra will mark out a sphere between the circumscribed and inscribed spheres, with rotations of the polyhedra essentially filling the space between the two spheres.  Arriving at the same observation of Alice that the average shadow is proportional only to the surface area, we can immediately conclude that the average shadow of a polyhedra is the same size as the shadow of a sphere with the same surface area.", "comment_date": "2021-12-21T08:26:59Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Great Fate", "comment_text": "this one is going to be a classic", "comment_date": "2021-12-21T08:16:16Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "JumpMetler", "comment_text": "Your image at the beginning is wrong for example at <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ltLUadnCyi0&amp;t=1m00s\">1:00</a>.

When I studied physics and math, we solved many problems by attacking the separation of variables (in classical mechanics and in differential equations) and by computing eigenfunctions (in quantum mechanics and math.) Eventually, I began to realize that whole categories of problems came down to how you define the canonical (unit vectors, quantum states, linear solutions) set of measures on a space, and how those can be combined to meet your boundary conditions. This only came to me as I repeatedly solved the wave equation, or the heat equation, or a set of quantum probabilities, over and over again in different contexts. I even took a course where we considered the eigenstates of a quantum system as defined by symmetric groups. The key insight of Alice is that there are whole classes of problems that can be solved and generalized as long as they&#39;re based on linear transformations, kind of like Tolstoy&#39;s quote about happy families. Later I studied non-linear dynamical systems, which, like Tolstoy&#39;s unhappy families, are each unhappy in their own way and are less amenable to generalization, so you have to use different techniques to analyze. The drawback to entirely relying on Bob&#39;s method is that sometimes you get so focused on the calculations that you lose sight of the possible generalizations that can save you time and give you insight.

You do an excellent job of showing us the complicated math, and showing us how to simplify. My goal was trying to solve it intuitively without using too much math and come close to the answer you would show us. I chose to try and use a unit cube, and have the light source directly overhead, a long way away.<br><br>My first thought was any 3D/2D shape rotated 360 degrees, while keeping the previous shadows, will make a spherical shadow with the largest tip to tip value for its diameter, if the light source is far away and directly above.<br><br>The first step was then to imagine the largest shadowed area possible for a unit cube, and rotate it to make a circle shadow. The longest tip to tip length in the cube is the diagonal. Using a little bit of the Pythagorean theorem, the longest tip to tip value or diameter is sqrt(3).<br><br>The third step was then to find the smallest circle shadow.

I&#39;ll give my best idea for how Alice avoids talking about distributions of orientations but it is somewhat longwinded.<br><br>Alice gets around the distribution problem when she uses her original result that for any given rotation, the shadow area of a 2d shape is proportional to the area of that shape. this is wrong because Alice is not in fact starting with a 2d shape in a 2d plane as you show at <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ltLUadnCyi0&amp;t=10m15s\">10:15</a>. She is instead starting with a 2d shape in 3d space. When you do this you do not get the same result that shadow area is proportional to shape area. For example, if we apply a certain 90-degree rotation to a unit square parallel to the plane we&#39;re projecting onto, the shadow area is 0 times the area of the square but if we apply that same rotation to a unit square perpendicular to the plane, we get 1 times the area of the square.<br><br>In a roundabout way, Alice is assuming that all orientations are equally likely when she says that the average shadow area across all orientations is a constant times the actual area. This is best illustrated with the above example. The two squares only have the same average shadow area when each rotation R has the same probability as that rotation composed with the rotation S that maps one square onto the other. When this is the case, for every rotation where the shadow area of the perpendicular square is A and the parallel square is B, there is another equally likely rotation where the shadow area of the perpendicular square is B and the Parallel square is A.<br><br>When dealing with the six sides of the cube, any distribution with cube-like symmetry will give the same average area for each side but when she starts approximating a sphere with increasingly complex polyhedra the only distribution that gives each patch of area the same average shadow area constant is a uniform distribution.", "comment_date": "2021-12-21T00:14:12Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Nathan Poteet", "comment_text": "Amazing video, as always.

For what it&#39;s worth, a computational geometry way of determining convexity of a polytope is: for each face it should hold that all vertices lie on or behind the plane of that face (beind meaning the side on which the volume of the polytope lies). For shapes in 2d this also holds, replacing faces with edges and planes with lines.

I would be in overwhelming favor of seeing a part 2 that further generalizes to concave shapes and/or to other projections (such as other light source positions).<br><br>One question I\u2019m left pondering is regarding this \u201cmeasure of convexity\u201d and how it relates to a related measure: namely, the ratio of a shape\u2019s volume to the volume of its convex hull. It\u2019s clear to me that the two become decoupled in cases where your shape encloses a nonzero 3D space (such as a hollow sphere); of course, in this case, the notion of surface area gets a bit more complicated anyway, as there is no longer a singular surface bounding the shape, but in the extreme case of an entirely hollow unit sphere, the volume of this shape is 0 while the volume of its convex hull is 4pi, whereas applying the measure given in the video, the shadow is of area pi while the surface area of this hollow sphere (taken as the sum of the inner and outer surfaces where this shell has thickness 0) is 8pi for a measure of convexity of 0.5. I can also see that poking a small hole in this shape doesn\u2019t really change the story: the average size of the shadow changes negligibly, as does the surface area (which is now a singular surface), maintaining a measure of convexity of ~0.5, while the one I proposed gives 0 still.<br><br>But then this begs two questions: 1) is it even possible to be \u201cmore concave\u201d than 0.5 by this shadow measure? (Thus far I have not thought of any example) And 2) is there a defined mapping between the two? If the answer to the first question is no, is this mapping the obvious one, where we linearly map the shadow method\u2019s [0.5, 1] interval to my method\u2019s [0, 1] interval?<br><br>I\u2019ll be trying to answer that for myself, but I hope it at least piques your interest :)<br><br>Edit: a little disappointed to figure out that the answer to both questions is no, even without relying on shapes with multiple bounding surfaces, thanks to the ability of a shape to increase both its volume and its surface area without increasing its average shadow size or convex hull size (the latter two of course being clearly related since the shadow of a shape is simply the convex hull of the linear projection onto a plane, or equivalently the linear projection onto a plane of the convex hull).

To illustrate, here&#39;s a story of how an ordinary mortal,  yours truly, once attempted to extract Newton&#39;s result that a planet moving under the influence of an inverse square force law traces an ellipse.<br><br>I was just out of high-school, about to enter university classes as a freshman in physics (having scored excellently in my entrance exams). At that point, I was familiar with calculus (differentiation, integration, limits, an inkling of how to solve 1st order differential equations by finding anti-derivatives). I knew about the principle of compositing independent motions, e.g. getting a parabolic trajectory for a projectile by adding up a uniform motion with a free fall. So, I thought I could easily do the same for the problem of planetary motion by compositing the inertial (tangential) motion of a planet with its vertical fall towards the center of the Sun.<br><br>I soon found myself hopelessly bogged in insurmountable difficulties, as the vertical direction changed from point to point of the trajectory, which did not happen in the simple parabolic trajectory problem. How long a step should my &quot;planet&quot; take tangentially, before gravity pulled it down? And which direction should it be pulled down, the one at the beginning or the one at the end of the step? I soon gave up, utterly confused. Later in my studies, when I encountered a solution using conservation of angular momentum, I was convinced: this was the way to go; Newton would never have taken such a silly and naive approach.<br><br>And yet, as I found out later still, Newton <b>did</b> take exactly this &quot;naive&quot; approach - the difference being, he saw it to the end and didn&#39;t give up like I did! Instead of wondering how long a step I should be taking, I should have pondered how the solution changes as I take smaller and smaller steps, to the limit of vanishingly small ones.

Learning/building nice theories harmonise better with an elegant mindset. When the same people get out to practical work, they often drift toward a &quot;Worker Mindset&quot;, which is Bob&#39;s case here. People should aim for a balance between the two, depending on the work they do, and also be conscious of those self-set boundaries, and when they leave them.<br>- I always teach the &quot;Healthy Laziness Philosophy&quot;. Before you jump on grinding out a solution, or solutionise something, have a look and see what are the things that you can generalise and avoid doing the same work multiple times. (This applies to most areas of life, not just maths. e.g. very useful in IT.) It usually takes some experience to guess efficiency turns on and off steps of generalisation, but that&#39;s something one can acquire over time.<br>- Bob&#39;s approach can be &quot;safer&quot; but more laborious. Alice&#39;s approach is riskier but potentially much faster and prone to less human errors. The problem is that we are talking about literal risks. You typically can&#39;t tell in advance whether there is an elegant/generalised solution or not, PLUS whether you can find it in a reasonable amount of time. In an ideal situation you have both Alice and Bob, let them start pursuing their paths, and after a time check in with both and have a discussion on the progresses. Independent presentation and then communication between Alice and Bob is crucial.<br>- Bob&#39;s approach is safe in the sense that it only applies to cubes. You can always use it with cubes, and it&#39;s a proven track to get there. Alice&#39;s approach has a few potential mines. e.g.: You may not be conscious about some of the assumptions you have made along the way. This is especially true when you dabble with infinites in any way. You tend to remember the base problem and the generalised solution, forgetting even some of the assumptions you have consciously made, and this can draw you into reusing the generalised solution where those assumptions do not apply. <br>- People are different, and have a different level of agility in different levels of abstraction. Some mindsets are better toward Alice&#39;s end of the spectrum, while others on Bob&#39;s end. (And this is obviously not a good-bad thing.) Always make sure to apply the appropriate person (mind) in a given area+problem. It will be better for the problem and better for the person.

Since the faces are separate now, it doesn\u2019t really matter that they were part of a cube anymore, so they can be rearranged into three sets of faces, each containing every possible face rotation. As a result, the sum (and average) of all the shadows of the faces in a single set can be calculated using the formula abs(cos(theta))s^2. The average would be avg(abs(cos(theta)))s^2, and I calculated the average of abs(cos(theta)) as being 2/pi.

However I find this argument to be a little flawed (even though it works here). My concern here is that, given that all steps fullfill some property that does not necessarily extend to the limit. A common example for this is Lebesgue&#39;s dominated convergence theorem, which is needed exactly because the integral of the limit of functions f_n does not necessarily equal the limit of the integral of f_n. Another easier example is that the limit of a series of continuous functions does not need to be itself continuous, e.g. x^n is continuous on [0,1] for all natural n, but the limit (for n going to infinty) is not continous, since it equals 0 everywhere on [0,1) and 1 at x=1.

This is pretty vibes based so it&#39;s not a proof or anything, but if we imagine a different probability for choosing the rotation of, let&#39;s say, a cube, let&#39;s say we have a 75% likelihood of landing exactly on the &quot;upright&quot; rotation, where the shadow is a square, and a 25% likelihood of landing on the &quot;standing on a corner&quot; rotation where the projection is a hexagon. Then let&#39;s compare the average area of the shadow with that distribution to the area of the shadow with the equal distribution where every rotation is equally likely, I assume those are different, i&#39;m not gonna check, but if they aren&#39;t let&#39;s assume we can come up with some other distribution with a different average area of the shadow, if we cannot do that the problem becomes trivial i think. Now let&#39;s take those same distributions and apply them to a sphere, this time both the distributions will give the same answer since the shadow is constant across all rotations. So if we were using a distribution that wasn&#39;t the equal distribution we saw in the video, I assume as we approached the sphere we would see the answer change to approach the answer given by the equal distribution as our cube approaches a sphere, presumably as the area of the sides we disproportionally measure in our unequal distribution gets spread evenly among all the other infinite sides of the sphere we&#39;re approaching.", "comment_date": "2021-12-20T16:55:34Z", "likes_count": 2}, {"comment_by": "Basavesh A", "comment_text": "Amazing!

I agree with this but I have a question that maybe some more advanced mathematician might be able to help:<br><br>To compute the length of the diagonal of a square, take a unit square, start on the left bottom vertex, and draw over the left vertical edge, then over the top horizontal edge, until you reach the top right corner. The length of the curve you drew is 2. Now start on the left bottom corner, go up half a unit, right half a unit up half a unit and right again. You reached the top right corner, your curve is now closer to the diagonal, and the length of your curve is 2 (again!). Repeat by always turning right or up when you reach the middle points of the segments of the previous construction. The length of the curve is always 2. The curve itself approximates the diagonal. In the limit, the points on the curve are the same as the points on the diagonal, but the lengths differ.<br><br>How can we be sure that the object we get as the limit of the polyhedra (the infinitely-sided polyhedra) has a surface area that is the same as the area of the sphere?
