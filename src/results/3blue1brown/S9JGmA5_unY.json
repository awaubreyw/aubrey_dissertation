But if a cryptographic hash function truly behaves like a random function, guessing and checking a nonce with a hash will not look like going through all possible hashes one-by-one, it&#39;s more like rolling a die over and over until you hit a 6, in which the expected number of rolls needed is 6, not 3.  While running this GigaGalactic supercomputer, many of the guesses will actually collide, so it is not a methodical search through all possible hashes.<br><br>However, as you point out, the actual security on SHA256 is indeed lower than 256-bits.  It turns out not to quite behave like a nice random function.

FIrst off, I saw in some other random YT video - that humans are pumping out roughly 60 quintillion inputs for the SHA 256 per second. So if humanity continued calculating at this pace, how long would we have to keep computing before we found 2 inputs that equate to the same output?<br><br>TLDR: A long fucking time. <br><br>Analogy: We have a lot of time to kill, so let&#39;s start by imagining that we kill time by walking in a straight line until we reach the moon. Once you reach the moon, turn around and come home. When you get home, (you would have been gone roughly 18 years) buy a powerball ticket. If that ticket wins the jackpot, buy a mega millions ticket. If the mega millions is ALSO a winner, flick a penny into the Grand Canyon. <br><br>After flicking the penny into the Grand Canyon, continue on your walk - back and forth from the Earth to the moon and back. Again, when you return to Earth, buy another powerball ticket. The only way you will ever throw a penny into the Grand Canyon, is if both the Powerball AND Mega Millions tickets are winners. As you could imagine, you&#39;re going to do this until all 5.45 million cubic yards of the Grand Canyon is completely filled to the brim with pennies. That&#39;s a lot of lotto wins!<br><br>Of course you haven&#39;t even scratched the surface of how much time needs to pass, so we&#39;re going to continue on with this pattern - until you have filled the Grand Canyon with pennies 200,000 times over. Eventually I&#39;m assuming you will get bored of filling the Grand Canyon with pennies, so after 200,000  of these fills you can switch to the Pacific ocean. The pacific ocean is a lot bigger than the Grand Canyon, and it would take about twice as long to fill with pennies as it took to fill the Grand Canyon 200,000 times. Woah. <br><br>Now that the pacific ocean is filled to the brim with pennies, empty it out and find a nice place on Earth to park a Chevy Malibu. Return to the Grand Canyon - Fill it with pennies 200,000 times. Return to the pacific ocean, and fill that with pennies as well. Keep in mind, each penny represents winning back-to-back lotteries after a round trip from the Earth to the moon and back at a walking pace. Each Chevy Malibu is going to be the equivalent amount of time as: filling the Grand Canyon with pennies 200,000 times as well as the pacific ocean once. <br><br>How many Chevy Malibus will we have to stack before we finally have run out of possible calculations? Answer: It&#39;s a fucking lot of Chevy Malibus. You&#39;re gonna stack those babies on top of each other until they too reach the moon. Then you&#39;re going to start a new stack of Chevy Malibus - and that stack too will also reach the moon. And then you&#39;re going to do another. <br>and another<br>and another <br>and another<br>until you have reached roughly 33.7249 Earth-Moon length stacks of Chevy Malibus. Now that you are exhausted, sick of pennies, and a little over 61 quindecillion years old, you can drive the last Chevy Malibu down the giant cosmic escalator of Malibus from roughly 3/4 of the way to the moon back to Earth where you will finally get to rest - and enjoy seeing 2 different inputs that provide the exact same 256 bit output in the SHA 256. I can only imagine what those 2 different inputs look like. I hope you&#39;ll share with the rest of us. Is it a picture of a Chevy Malibu and the dimensions of a penny? Is it one of the back-to-back lottery winning numbers? Who knows? You do. Because you did it.", "comment_date": "2021-10-23T06:58:25Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Love Bystr\u00f6m", "comment_text": "So weird when two videos referance themselves haha", "comment_date": "2021-10-22T05:46:47Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "GAGRA", "comment_text": "Almost 2^23 subscribers rn", "comment_date": "2021-10-21T23:12:58Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Honza Juricka", "comment_text": "2^18 subscribers... guess you&#39;re good at this youtube thing", "comment_date": "2021-10-19T10:36:19Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Chris", "comment_text": "Today, 2\u00b3\u2076 lol", "comment_date": "2021-10-19T09:41:03Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "AzoN Donny", "comment_text": "1 percent of my total power", "comment_date": "2021-10-19T05:10:54Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "IlIllIIlIlI Il", "comment_text": "All it takes is one lucky guess", "comment_date": "2021-10-17T20:24:48Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "num maker", "comment_text": "that&#39;s big.

To record a single bit by changing the state of a system requires an amount of energy no less than kT, where T is the absolute temperature of the system and k is the Boltzman constant. (Stick with me; the physics lesson is almost over.)<br><br>Given that k=1.38\u22c510^\u221216erg/\u2218Kelvin, and that the ambient temperature of the universe is 3.2\u2218K, an ideal computer running at 3.2\u2218K would consume 4.4\u22c510^\u221216 ergs every time it set or cleared a bit. To run a computer any colder than the cosmic background radiation would require extra energy to run a heat pump.<br><br>Now, the annual energy output of our sun is about 1.21\u22c510^41 ergs. This is enough to power about 2.7\u22c510^56 single bit changes on our ideal computer; enough state changes to put a 187-bit counter through all its values. If we built a Dyson sphere around the sun and captured all of its energy for 32 years, without any loss, we could power a computer to count up to 2^192. Of course, it wouldn\u2019t have the energy left over to perform any useful calculations with this counter.<br><br>But that\u2019s just one star, and a measly one at that. A typical supernova releases something like 10^51 ergs. (About a hundred times as much energy would be released in the form of neutrinos, but let them go for now.) If all of this energy could be channeled into a single orgy of computation, a 219-bit counter could be cycled through all of its states.<br><br>These numbers have nothing to do with the technology of the devices; they are the maximums that thermodynamics will allow. And they strongly imply that brute-force attacks against 256-bit keys will be infeasible until computers are built from something other than matter and occupy something other than space.&quot;<br><br>Using the Dyson Sphere example, where would the counter be after 64 years, 128 years, 256 years, 512 years, and 1,024 years?  At 2^193, 2^194, 2^195, 2^196, and 2^197, respectively.  After 1,048,576 years?  2^207.  After 1,073,741,824 years?  2^217.  After that... the sun becomes a RED GIANT and CONSUMES the Dyson Sphere.  That will PROBABLY be less of a concern than its incineration of the Earth.  When would the counter reach the halfway mark, giving a 50% chance of correctly guessing the 256-bit key?  At 2^255.  When would the counter have a &quot;one-in-a-million&quot; chance?  At 2^236.  It is IMPOSSIBLE to brute-force 256-bit encryption.

Hashing algorithm&#39;s are a 1-way street, meaning it will scramble your message, but you cannot unscramble it and get the original message back. When people are trying to find the right SHA256, what they are really trying to do is just find a copy of &#39;YOUR&#39; SHA-256 that the computer accepts as its key. This is good for hiding your private key values, as the number of guesses is so astronomical, that even modern day computers can&#39;t keep up. SHA-256 is good for providing Integrity, making sure data itself has not changed, however please do not mistake it for encrypting your data as it does not do this. So when you think of security, you can think of SHA-256 as a good tool for making sure data has not be changed (providing integrity), but not providing security to the level that encryption can offer.

Most importantly, they neglect to explain the fact that security is only as strong as the weakest link.<br>Sure, if you find a random hash and the only information you have about it is the hash function and the fact that the input was 256 bits, then yes you have 2^256 possibilities. However, in reality that is rarely the case when the user is involved. If the 256bits are a 32 character/byte long password, then an assumption of 96 options per byte is not too unrealistic. It represents roughly all printable characters in 7 bit ASCII. This reduces the complexity by about 40 000 billion. So instead of a 4 billionth chance after 37 times the age of the universe, you have a roughly 400 000th chance after 126.8 years. It is of course, still a ridicules large amount of effort. If we throw in the ASICs, we can of course slice the number by 1000 and end up with 1/400th chance. Still an impractical amount of effort given galaxies of super computers. <br><br>Now lets assume that we know that this password is from someone a little bit more stupid and unaware. Lets say the password is only lower case a-z. This gives 26 options per byte and thus 26^32 options in total. This is still 256 bits into the hash function, but we know the complexity of the input is far lower. In fact, it reduces the complexity by about 6*10^31 or 60 000 billion billion billion. In other words, the giga galactic super computer has a roughly 1/900th chance of solving this every second. If we throw in ASICs, it should solve this every second even at worst case. Still ridiculously impractical, but also very far away from what this video describes. However, if we start stripping out more complexity, say reducing the input down to 12 characters, each with 26 options, we are left with a complexity of 26^12, roughly 95 million billion or something a single computer with ASICs could solve within 47 days at worst.

Suppose that&#39;s all this computer did: flip a single bit from one to zero and back again, over and over. (No counting: that&#39;s too complicated, reserved for a future version of the system. Certainly no complicated hashing or other common brute-force crypto-attack techniques: this is just a prototype.) Suppose you put this computer in the most naturally-cold place in the universe, to maximize its efficiency. (Don&#39;t want to spend energy on cooling, only on bit-flipping.)<br><br><br>Now suppose you could capture the entire energy output of a standard-size supernova, and feed this energy into your super-cold bit-flipper--assuming the existence of whatever energy-storage technology would be necessary to spread out the energy consumption over whatever time interval the bit-flipper required.<br><br><br>A supernova&#39;s worth of energy would be enough to power the bit-flipper through about 2^192 bit flips; which means you&#39;d need to feed in 2^64 supernovas to get all the way up to 2^256.  So that&#39;s version 0.1.

This session key is used because public key cryptography is not fast enough to use directly, and may even be weaker.

If this is correct, then while Bitcoin&#39;s protocol sees a great deal of computing power being applied, this power is in the hands of relatively few actual actors, since by playing into one&#39;s relative marginal advantage by increasing scale, one can manipulate the protocol into crowding out other miners.

Here is why. 10,057 is a little less than the square of 101. and 101 x 101 = 10,201. and 10,201 - 10,057 leaves a remainder of 144. which is the square of 12.\u00a0 So we now know that 10,057 is (101 +12) x (101 - 12) = 113 x\u00a089 our two Prime numbers.
