I&#39;m an electronics engineer turned Software Development Manager over the course of 20+ years and I decided to go for a Masters in AI, mostly for intellectual interest in the area. So, I started revising my Maths when I stumbled upon this and was left literally speechless with the clarity, insights and clear explanations of the fundamentals of one of the toughest areas of mathematics. How so much fun and productive my uni years would have been had I had access to this type of free (!!!!) content.  What difference it would have made in the training of engineers, many of which just developed strategies to squeeze through their exams, never having properly grasped the subject and its relation to their areas!

I shall begin with the warnings. All over the comment section I have observed numerous comments saying that, say \u201cwhy isn\u2019t maths being taught this way at school?\u201d or \u201cyour videos have inspired me to go in for maths, thank you!\u201d etc.. I should warn you, that it is quite easy to become arrogant. Let me expand upon that. Say, you have just finished this series (or this video), and from observing the beautiful intuitive constructs at play and seeing certain relations, you may start to feel as if you already know the subject, as though you already know the subtleties and by appealing to intuition anything, even the hardest problem, can be resolved. The harsh truth is that it is not even remotely so. Pick any calculus textbook after watching this series, open, say, a section on the mean value theorem of the differential calculus, or certain integration problems, or maybe just the limits section with all of the definitions and propositions etc. and open the problem set included, without reviewing the theory written beforehand. You will be surprised that if the texbook is decent enough (pick, for instance, Richard Courant\u2019s \u201cDifferential and Integral Calculus\u201d), then you will not be able to solve even a third of those. Can you prove, for example, that using L\u2019Hopital\u2019s rule to find the limit of f(x) = sin(x)/x as x tends to 0 is considered to be the mathematical equivalent of committing a crime? When I first watched this series, I could not, and I was getting laughed upon for that. You see, \u201cskipping\u201d the formalisms and definitions, heading straight for the picturesque intuition and calling it a day is wrong. For formalisms unravel more information than you could possibly hope to with intuition, plus they allow you to (a) see the \u201cgreater picture\u201d of the mathematical principles at play; (b) exclude the flaws that emerge from an intuitive understanding of the concepts. For those who go in for mathematics this later becomes a devastating disappointment and they find out that they have actually been led astray all the time, discouraging them from going further into the immensely beautiful field that is Mathematics, simply because they thought that only bad teachers jump into formalisms and that intuition is the sole thing that matters. <br><br>Remember this: <b>A good Mathematics teacher reveals the intuition behind the concepts. An excellent teacher intertwines it with formalism and abstraction, while not losing the intuition from sight, simply expanding upon it greatly.</b><br><br>As regards the criticism I mentioned: Grant (I hope I am not insulting you by referring to you directly by your name, I apologise if that is so), I think that you should make more remarks regarding the fact that there is much more information than that which you introduce. As far as I can remember, at the very start of the series, you mentioned that very briefly, but soon it devolved into phrases such as \u201cIf you know what the word \u201capproach\u201d means, you already know what the limit is\u201d, which is just plain wrong, even though you made a little remark about epsilon-delta arguments, which is still not enough in the slightest. I should like to suggest that you make certain textbook recommendations if not on particular concepts, but at least upon that branch of Mathematics as a whole. It is needed in order (a) that students do not get confused and discouraged when they hit their forehead at the formalism and rigour of the Mathematics; (b) to make your course more \u201ccomplete\u201d, if you can put it this way. If the latter is not your general aim, then, as I have already said, I believe you should make short glimpses of the \u201creality\u201d of Mathematics, such as \u201cI hope I have provided you with all the necessary intuition. This intuition, though beautiful and useful in and of itself, is almost nothing like what you will encounter \u201cin the wild\u201d, that being\u2026\u201d, for instance.<br><br>Thank you!", "comment_date": "2022-05-14T14:44:18Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "rueeh", "comment_text": "say you have a set of points in the graph,  we need to compute an approximally minimum area that contain all the points\r<br>and then we are given points in space, we want to check  if they belong to this area or not\r<br>how can one solve his problem? i&#39;m kind of new to math", "comment_date": "2022-05-14T11:14:54Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "john macmillan", "comment_text": "Whoa!

A stupid scholar all overturned this truth and built it to a convenient system of Mason. Thus, the people believe the trickery of the devil than words of God. Darwin&#39;s evolutionary theory, the Copernican theory of Galileo, the theory of relativity, quantum mechanics, mathematics, the medicine of Einstein are all errors. A ghost, a UFO, supernatural power, the miracle of God to be said to be the occult are rather true. A thing and a ghost (God) exist in the world, and space is active by spiritual power (conception) of God. As for God, all things were created by the soul of language. It is clear if I read the Bible. Because the present scholar mixes the logic thoroughly in human wisdom, it cannot arrive at the truth. It is intuitive power to be important. Why does a child seem to be? The thing which cannot answer this is a mistake. Our common sense is more right than a stupid scholar. The creation of God comes loose only by a fate. Everything becomes the material by a conception of God (person).<br> <br>I cannot prove 1+1 = 2 in a numerical formula. I can prove only a physical phenomenon to say that it is in two apples when I match another one apple with one apple. It is not 0+1 \u2260 1. As 0 (nothing) is not quality, you must not handle it for a number. Because quality is different even if I match a mandarin orange with an apple, there is not a meaning of the addition. Because it does not exist other than God when I define God as existence, no (0) does not exist. Because the mathematics defines 0, negative number, imaginary number, \u221e which do not exist in the world, it is an error and is a fiction. A number is to count quality. When I am separated from a physical phenomenon, the mathematics does not have the significance of being.<br><br>\u203bIf 0 exists by a definition of the mathematics, 0 of the infinity must exist. However, the infinite space, infinity do not exist. In other words, because the mathematics defines 0, negative number, imaginary number, \u221e which do not exist, it is an error and is a fiction. Therefore it is an error because a zeta function, the numerical formula of the second oiler product deal with this infinity. That it becomes sum of series \u03a3 = 1+2+3+ ... = - 1/12 of the natural number, or the product of all prime numbers is 4\u03c0^2. It turns out that it is an error if I think for common sense. It is limited, and the mathematician seems to get a wrong this, but uses the sophism when I calculate this endlessly if right. This is a mistake of the definition of 0 or \u221e and is the evidence that mathematics gets a wrong. It is definition f&#39;(x) = limh of the differential calculus that must not divide it by 0 \u2192 0 {the same as it being 0 that says that I bring h close to 0 without a limit, and dividing it by a numerical formula of f(x+h)-f(x)}/h. I divide it by 0. The mathematics is trickery not study in this way.<br><br> All the origins of the scientific theory are random, and a bottom is broken. For example, in the theory of elementary particles, an electron joins atoms together and becomes the molecules. A thing joining a proton and a neutron together is a mesotron, and three quarks connect the proton, and there is it. An electron and a positron (antimatter) occur from a photon. An elementary particle to tie the elementary particle to whenever a new elementary particle is discovered is necessary and loses the relations with an elementary particle and the elementary particle more and more. Though a proton and the neutron are the same mass, why does a difference occur in having electric charge or not? The science has no answer with it in these questions. An electron is a material so that I think, and the positron is not a material in the hole of the material loss that the circumference was surrounded by in the soul children. In other words, the antimatter is an illusion. The scholar is going to examine it logically and loses sight of the truth. The structure of built nature of God is simpler, but is the thing which it is hard to understand in the human wisdom. A photon seems to have a particle and the two characteristics of the wave, but, in fact, the light has the property of the wave with the soul body.<br><br> Message from the spiritual world of Einstein <br> When oneself saw a scene of heaven through a tunnel of the light in the meantime, the person who experienced suspended animation well is you after the revival. The moving speed of the soul does not receive gravitational restraint anymore, and, as for the law of the speed of light immutability that I discovered during the lifetime, there are none in the world of the consciousness. In other words, I will say that it just moves to say that I think. Furthermore, it is just handed down to a partner to have thought. The life of all of us shares what one interiority. And the material is to say that it was actually consciousness. There are all things in your heart, and, also, you are existence to live in a heart of all life. When all of this space watches it with eyes, it is seen like the outside world, but is to say that the world to be actually seen outside is your interiority. The relativity disappears in here, and this space consists based on &quot;universal truth to certainly say to call God&quot;. <br><br> Near future to read from revelation and illuminati card of God of days, and to untie it in Japan<br> April, 2020 xx day The United States bombs North Korea. North Korea adds nuclear attack to a big city of Japan and a U.S. base as the retaliation. Japan swats it to a bog of the war, and they are dropped by a plot of the United States. There are China, Russia after North Korea and becomes the fight with Japan, American allied powers and drags the world into World War 3.<br> x moon xx Japan and the United States country attacks it in Japan with the Allied Forces in 2021<br> World War 3 begins in 2021 on xx moon xx day<br> Mount Fuji erupts very much on xx day in October, 2023. Major earthquakes occur in a row in all parts of the world. <br> An asteroid collides on the earth on xx moon xx day in 2023, and the earth becomes muddy sea <br> The world (heaven) of the Maitreya is built on xx moon xx day in 2024<br><br> Final note<br> The human being denies violence and war, but is it not violence and killing each other I kill a cow pig, and to eat meat? I conquer the world in the life of the hell of the cruel survival of the fittest and am useless even if only oneself is going to be saved. Because a killed animal retaliates for a human being, cancer occurs. The meat which I ate becomes the blood, and a vindictive spirit dwells in a cell when blood does formation to a cell. A human being is cruel, and a fornication, a falsehood, committing theft, the habit of the evil deed of the luxury are not stopped. Eating meat is indirect killing. Why is God that existence of the evil is permitted? It lets you compensate for a human crime by the devil. A disaster, an epidemic, the war damage are the wrath of Heaven. Because a Japanese savior buys the crime of the world people, it is sacrificed. I fall in the trees and plants in spite of the pains then even if I writhe with a hell if it is just and changes the heart and does not straighten an act to measure up to hearts of God. Mason finally leads the world to the World War 3. it is started with nuclear attack to Japan as a pilot light.

I add the thing which realized it by the imagination of own brains and convey the truth. The world moves for the will of God and the devil. God let the world employ a saint in order to tell the will of God to a human being. It is Prince Shotoku and is Christ, Buddha. The picture that they were shown in meditation is our future event. The future is never fixed, but, in the domain that I can change in human beings, is accomplished a prophecy street of God small. For a before the fact period, I am listed in the Apocalypse in cipher. <br><br>  The flood of Noah is a true story, and we are the survivors. The judgment of God is strict. God finally cuts maximum permissible level, and the ogre of the obstacle of the heaven establishment is exterminated. There is the story by the act of the angel listed in the Apocalypse. <br><br>\u203bOnly the earth is the material world, and 1m or more above the ground are God world. Therefore the alien does not exist because space is a spiritual world.  The moon is the soul health, but becomes the material when a human being is going to touch it. The soul body becomes the material in God and a human conception. The evidence that it is the soul body that changes color in a red color such as the yellow pale blood that the moon is white as for the evidence. Because the principle of constancy of light velocity of Einstein is a lie, and the light is the soul health, I move to an end of the space at a moment. This is because a material makes that a human being <br><br>\u203bThe most stupid one is a scholar of winning the Nobel Prize, and the first genius is Prince Shotoku of the medium of the wisdom that excelled in intuitive power.<br><br> We are delivered from it from brainwashing of the science (mathematics, physics) got by a lie, and let&#39;s regain true study in our hand. <br> <br>The science is the fiction which I made because the devil denies God, and what is listed in a Japanese old legend and the Christian Bible is true. A stupid scholar all overturned this truth and built it to a convenient system of Mason. Thus, the people believe the trickery of the devil than words of God. Darwin&#39;s evolutionary theory, the Copernican theory of Galileo, the theory of relativity, quantum mechanics, mathematics, the medicine of Einstein are all errors. A ghost, a UFO, supernatural power, the miracle of God to be said to be the occult are rather true. A thing and a ghost (God) exist in the world, and space is active by spiritual power (conception) of God. As for God, all things were created by the soul of language. It is clear if I read the Bible. Because the present scholar mixes the logic thoroughly in human wisdom, it cannot arrive at the truth. It is intuitive power to be important. Why does a child seem to be? The thing which cannot answer this is a mistake. Our common sense is more right than a stupid scholar. The creation of God comes loose only by a fate. Everything becomes the material by a conception of God (person).<br> <br>I cannot prove 1+1 = 2 in a numerical formula. I can prove only a physical phenomenon to say that it is in two apples when I match another one apple with one apple. It is not 0+1 \u2260 1. As 0 (nothing) is not quality, you must not handle it for a number. Because quality is different even if I match a mandarin orange with an apple, there is not a meaning of the addition. Because it does not exist other than God when I define God as existence, no (0) does not exist. Because the mathematics defines 0, negative number, imaginary number, \u221e which do not exist in the world, it is an error and is a fiction. A number is to count quality. When I am separated from a physical phenomenon, the mathematics does not have the significance of being.<br><br>\u203bIf 0 exists by a definition of the mathematics, 0 of the infinity must exist. However, the infinite space, infinity do not exist. In other words, because the mathematics defines 0, negative number, imaginary number, \u221e which do not exist, it is an error and is a fiction. Therefore it is an error because a zeta function, the numerical formula of the second oiler product deal with this infinity. That it becomes sum of series \u03a3 = 1+2+3+ ... = - 1/12 of the natural number, or the product of all prime numbers is 4\u03c0^2. It turns out that it is an error if I think for common sense. It is limited, and the mathematician seems to get a wrong this, but uses the sophism when I calculate this endlessly if right. This is a mistake of the definition of 0 or \u221e and is the evidence that mathematics gets a wrong. It is definition f&#39;(x) = limh of the differential calculus that must not divide it by 0 \u2192 0 {the same as it being 0 that says that I bring h close to 0 without a limit, and dividing it by a numerical formula of f(x+h)-f(x)}/h. I divide it by 0. The mathematics is trickery not study in this way.<br><br> All the origins of the scientific theory are random, and a bottom is broken. For example, in the theory of elementary particles, an electron joins atoms together and becomes the molecules. A thing joining a proton and a neutron together is a mesotron, and three quarks connect the proton, and there is it. An electron and a positron (antimatter) occur from a photon. An elementary particle to tie the elementary particle to whenever a new elementary particle is discovered is necessary and loses the relations with an elementary particle and the elementary particle more and more. Though a proton and the neutron are the same mass, why does a difference occur in having electric charge or not? The science has no answer with it in these questions. An electron is a material so that I think, and the positron is not a material in the hole of the material loss that the circumference was surrounded by in the soul children. In other words, the antimatter is an illusion. The scholar is going to examine it logically and loses sight of the truth. The structure of built nature of God is simpler, but is the thing which it is hard to understand in the human wisdom. A photon seems to have a particle and the two characteristics of the wave, but, in fact, the light has the property of the wave with the soul body.<br><br> Message from the spiritual world of Einstein <br> When oneself saw a scene of heaven through a tunnel of the light in the meantime, the person who experienced suspended animation well is you after the revival. The moving speed of the soul does not receive gravitational restraint anymore, and, as for the law of the speed of light immutability that I discovered during the lifetime, there are none in the world of the consciousness. In other words, I will say that it just moves to say that I think. Furthermore, it is just handed down to a partner to have thought. The life of all of us shares what one interiority. And the material is to say that it was actually consciousness. There are all things in your heart, and, also, you are existence to live in a heart of all life. When all of this space watches it with eyes, it is seen like the outside world, but is to say that the world to be actually seen outside is your interiority. The relativity disappears in here, and this space consists based on &quot;universal truth to certainly say to call God&quot;. <br><br> Near future to read from revelation and illuminati card of God of days, and to untie it in Japan<br> April, 2020 xx day The United States bombs North Korea. North Korea adds nuclear attack to a big city of Japan and a U.S. base as the retaliation. Japan swats it to a bog of the war, and they are dropped by a plot of the United States.

I conquer the world in the life of the hell of the cruel survival of the fittest and am useless even if only oneself is going to be saved. Because a killed animal retaliates for a human being, cancer occurs. The meat which I ate becomes the blood, and a vindictive spirit dwells in a cell when blood does formation to a cell. A human being is cruel, and a fornication, a falsehood, committing theft, the habit of the evil deed of the luxury are not stopped. Eating meat is indirect killing. Why is God that existence of the evil is permitted? It lets you compensate for a human crime by the devil. A disaster, an epidemic, the war damage are the wrath of Heaven. Because a Japanese savior buys the crime of the world people, it is sacrificed. I fall in the trees and plants in spite of the pains then even if I writhe with a hell if it is just and changes the heart and does not straighten an act to measure up to hearts of God. Mason finally leads the world to the World War 3. it is started with nuclear attack to Japan as a pilot light.

Due to its generality, no other theory/model/structure besides the CTMU can qualify as a mathematical and scientific &quot;Theory of Everything&quot;. The CTMU bridges the gap between mind and matter while unifying formerly incongruent theories (i.e. unifying physics and it with biology).<br><br>&quot;Inasmuch as science is observational or perceptual in nature, the goal of providing a scientific model and mechanism for the evolution of complex systems ultimately requires a supporting theory of reality of which perception itself is the model (or theory-to-universe mapping).  Where information is the abstract currency of perception, such a theory must incorporate the theory of information while extending the information concept to incorporate reflexive self-processing in order to achieve an intrinsic (self-contained) description of reality.&quot; CTMU<br><br>Reflexive self processing is described via the &quot;Conspansive Matrix&quot;, a formally defined structure amounting to a rotated &quot;Minkowski diagram&quot;, which generates Venn-like diagrams, the regression (filtration) and overlapping of which amount to the most generic description of space-time possible in any formal or even hypothetical account. The &quot;reflexive&quot; processing of local (quantum) states within the (entangled) context of the &quot;overall system&quot; is the only plausible description given Bell&#39;s Theorem and the known law of physics.<br><br>Basically, the &quot;Conspansive Matrix&quot; describes space-time as a hierarchy of parallel-processed universal computers, the input of which is Global and the output of which is local and syntactically arbitrary.<br><br>&quot;Originally called the Computation-Theoretic Model of the Universe, the CTMU was initially defined on a hierarchical nesting of universal computers, the Nested Simulation Tableau or NeST, which tentatively described spacetime as stratified virtual reality in order to resolve a decision-theoretic paradox put forth by Los Alamos physicist William Newcomb&quot; C.M. Langan, Physics &amp; Metaphysics<br><br>&quot;Where physical fields of force control or program dynamical geometry, and programming is logically stratified as in NeST, fields become layered stacks of parallel distributive programming that decompose into field strata (conspansive layers) related by an intrinsic requantization function inhering in, and logically inherited from, the most primitive and connective layer of the stack.&quot; <b>*ibid*</b><br><br>The &quot;requantization function&quot; inherent in (logically implied-by) the Conspansive Matrix (NeST structure) is the only logical description of QM &quot;non locality&quot; and &quot;superposition&quot;, while simultaneously explaining Relativistic &quot;frame dilation&quot;, as well as so-called &quot;dark&quot; matter &amp; energy. Being the only logical description of these otherwise entirely non-unified subjects is the  hallmark of universal, scientific, and mathematical generality.<br><br>&quot;Because the universe now plays the role of invariant, there exists a global standard rate of inner expansion or mutual absorption among the contents of the universe (\u201ccinvariance\u201d), and due to syntactic covariance, objects must be resized or \u201crequantized\u201d with each new event according to a constant (time-independent) rescaling factor residing in global syntax.  Second, because the rate of shrinkage is a constant function of a changing size ratio, the universe appears from an internal vantage to be accelerating in its \u201cexpansion\u201d, leading to the conspansive dual of a positive cosmological constant.&quot; CTMU<br><br>The CTMU has leapfrogged the status-quo academic descriptions of &quot;reality theory,&quot; and by a quantum margin, in the same way Heliocentrism (and its political implications) had during the last academically-enforced dark age period.

I&#39;ve been confused about why dx approaches zero but x does not even though the AREAS of all three rectangles approach zero at the same rate. As x approaches zero, the rectangles representing the change in x begin to look like line segments. The square representing dx on the other hand approaches a point. A line segment may not have area, but it does have length and that can be measured. A point is non dimensional and so is TRULY zero in all three dimensions. So as you approach zero, dx approaches zero and x approaches the length of the line segment that it approaches. This helped me understand why even though the AREA of all three rectangles approach zero, dx is the only element that actually approaches zero itself.", "comment_date": "2021-06-26T13:15:41Z", "likes_count": 23}, {"comment_by": "SURESH", "comment_text": "THank you and a big hanks to all the people who helped in this video.", "comment_date": "2021-06-26T07:37:23Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Anjaneya Sharma", "comment_text": "After lot of study came to the conclusion<br>Trigo   calculus is nonsense   both integral and differential<br>  The list of trigo formulas is of no use.<br>Anybody can verify what I am saying.<br>  Integrate sinx from 0 to 2pi  0 to 4 pi and 0 to 6pi.

It really accomplishes its goal of presenting the material so that the student says, &quot;I could have invented Calculus.&quot;<br><br>I have never seen anyone start with the circle and turn the areas into small rectangles before. It is a great starting place, and accomplishes multiple goals. The students learn the thought processes used to develop mathematics in general and Calculus specifically. They gain deeper insights into how the integral is developed and it relation to real world scenarios. And they learn why the formula for the area of circle looks like it does as an added bonus.<br><br>Understanding why the calculations are done the way are and how they relate to real world problems give the student the deep understanding of Calculus so often lacking in traditional classrooms where the teacher just drones on about equations and applications.<br><br>I wish math teachers did better jobs of teaching calculus in this manner because it would have made my job of teaching Physics so much easier. As it was, I had to teach Calculus before and alongside Physics. I had a policy of teaching the students how the equations they used were derived and how they related to the real world situations they described.

The gradient function that is derived in this way is known as the derivative function.<br><br>Integration, on the other hand, is the reverse process of differentiation. This means, from a given derivative function, the original undifferentiated function is found. Some functions have no analytical integral.<br><br>The area under a curve in two dimentions is an example evaluation of integration. An integral function is evaluated for a given interval.

The problem is I just cannot learn that way. I think it was a terrible way to teach. After two years of study I did not understand calculus beyond knowing some of the rules (&quot;how to differentiate&quot;, &quot;how to integrate&quot;) and I remember being even unable to revise my notes because I had no idea what was going on.

I honestly believe that private study with a video like this is a far better way to learn. Sure, now we have video on demand and easy production of animations by individuals, but an animation like this could have been done quite cheaply even in the 80s, and if they had given me these videos on VHS tape and sent me home to watch them I swear I could have passed that exam after just a few weeks study.<br><br>Caveat: the videos would have to be produced by as good a teacher as 3Blue1Brown of course.

So now when I made the inner circumference = 0 and the outer circumference the circumference of the whole circle, I can now visualize a right triangle, just like your graph, and my formula so far is: (2r\u03c0r)/2.

It wants us to look deeper into problems, think about them, and come up with different ways to solve them. Also, if we&#39;re taught concepts like derivatives and integrals, how we would solve them without the already taught formulae. How we would even try different methods, as if we ourselves were <a href=\"http://mathematicians.so/\">mathematicians.So</a> it starts with the simple concept of finding the area of a circle. We can come up with different methods of finding it, but one example is cutting the circle into many concentric rings and labelling the thicknesses as &#39;dr&#39;. Now, when we lay down one ring, it&#39;ll almost look like a rectangle. We can only assume this because we consider the trapeziums to be very very thin. Obviously, their lengths will be the corresponding circumferences 2\u03c0r (their radii are varying). Area of each rectangle is then 2\u03c0rdr. It&#39;s important to know that even though it&#39;s not entirely accurate, the accuracy increases as dr decreases. Now when f we place all the strips on a graph with their radius lengths on the X axis and their lengths (2\u03c0r) on the Y axis and slope 2\u03c0. Now we usually see the area under the graph to calculate all the areas of the strips. This is a <a href=\"http://triangle.it/\">triangle.It</a> comes out to be \u03c0r^2. Hence its a problem where we find the sum of many small values where the limit (here, dr) approaches 0. This is integration, and it&#39;s found by the area under the graph. Similarly for other more complex graphs (example, for finding integral of x^2, we assume there is tiny increase in area &#39;dA&#39; with the change in X axis as dx and Y axis as x^2 and then take area under graph.) Here, dA/dx is derivative of Area A. So, we come to the fundamental theorem of Calculus that Integral and Derivatives are, in a way, inverses of each other.

I seem to get very distracted when I intuitively pick up on problems within an argument intended to teach a simplified example. The entire first time I watched the video I was distracted by the thought, &quot;both ends of the cut rectangle are equal. One end can be cut matched to the other and made into an exact rectangle.&quot; All that talk about &#39;approximation&#39; didn&#39;t make sense to me. I followed the logic just fine but failed to connect with the underlying perspective.<br>    The second time watching this video I connected the example of the car&#39;s velocity/distance curve and I finally understand the need for approximating the size of dx. This kind of situation has been a challenge for me in the past when I was in school. <br>Intuitively, I see the area of a circle to triangle issue differently. Just view the radius of a circle as the base of a triangle. Then look at the circumference as the height, but with some posture issues. Once the height gets stood up straight you have your triangle untwisted. It&#39;s not so easy to take that intuitive understanding and backtrack to one proposed as an approximation.<br>  On a Myers-Briggs test I tend to score very high percentages on the intuitive scale but only average for the &quot;thinking&quot; aspect. I always test as an INTJ. Once I get past algebra I seem to struggle. <br>    I don&#39;t mean to be critical of another Content Creator, and writing this is probably totally pointless as it&#39;s inevitably lost in the sea of comments. I really appreciate someone that takes such an intuitive approach to teaching. I don&#39;t know how you could address a problem like intuitive &#39;holes&#39; within teaching methodology, but I&#39;ve always found them challenging. Perhaps I will be able to better understand by rewatching your content several times.<br>   February 26th 2014 I was hit by a car while commuting to work on a bicycle. Now I&#39;m partially disabled. At 33 I am forced to use my mind to get by instead of muscles but it is particularly difficult to take on these subjects later in life. I need to add new tools to my mental toolbox.

Your approach of explaining it; us being the sort of mathematician and like trying to come up with it, explaining it to us from the inside out is just brilliant, and you nailed it.

In some cases, just the simple quadratic equation coming to mind, where we are expected to just memorize it and use it when we need to, I actually took time to learn how it works the way it does, and I used that knowledge once to literally take the equation apart and use just a part of it to solve a problem. You&#39;d never be able to do that with just memorizing it.<br>I&#39;m excited to see this series and see how all those derivative functions work, because that was the only thing that really annoyed me when taking calculus.

Our approximation (while it does get closer) is <b>always</b> less than the actual area. (You can see this in the ending graph so 2pi*r: the bars are always under the graph.) The natural analog to this is to consider the r so that it&#39;s always just above the graph. So, while we chose the r to be 0.1, 0.2, ..., 3, we will now choose r&#39; to be 0, 0.1, 0.2, ..., 2.9. Using much the same argument, we can show that this one will also converge to pi*r^2 for the area. Because one was always bigger and the other was always smaller, we can conclude that at infinity both have the same area, and whatever&#39;s in between (the actual circle), must also converge to pi*r^2.<br><br>(Rigor for the last step is the Squeeze Theorem.)", "comment_date": "2017-04-29T13:33:57Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Owen Loh", "comment_text": "ive been waiting for this for sooooo fuckin long", "comment_date": "2017-04-29T13:29:44Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Bojan Skoric", "comment_text": "Your animational approach is just briliant!
