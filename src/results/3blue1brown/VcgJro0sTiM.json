I had such a struggle for 3 semesters in Calc 1 that I am trying to spend a good amount of time during the summer just studying on my own to try and give myself a leg up.<br><br>The beginning of Calc 2 introduces the idea of an infinite number of slices where the slice is some surface area A(x). The integral on a range of that A(x) is the volume of the resultant solid. Doing this for a sphere and proving the sphere volume formula was an awakening moment for me. I mean, it was visceral and deeply intuitive once seen. One of those things that cements what I have learned until now and ties it to something I have always known, like an anchor. So I began to look deeper into the volume of a sphere.....where did it originally come from?! Surely it wasn&#39;t from integral calculus!!!<br><br>Would you consider doing a video example of Archimedes &quot;On the sphere and cylinder&quot; proof of the volume of a sphere?
