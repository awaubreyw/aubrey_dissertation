A) you don&#39;t care where the tower is newly created B) following your &quot;algorithm&quot;, the towers en up solved in different towers C) the tower they finish on is related to the parity, no big deal. But, casually, the parity (I mean if it is an odd or pair number of disks) is very closely related to the last bit in binary, precisely the bit you decided to have an arbitrary behaviour.

In the ideal solution you never move the same disk twice in a row (because you could just move it once in the right position in the first place), so for odd numbered moves you move disk 0, for even numbered moves you move whatever else is available, in the only available place. The disk you have to move is always forced by this simple argument of &quot;not doing useless moving around&quot;: counting in binary, or thinking about recursion does not give useful information to solve the problem (but helps to figure out the total number of moves, see below), because the only choice we have to make is &quot;where do I have to put disk 0 now?&quot;<br><br>The only &quot;solution&quot; part of the video is thus &quot;always move disk 0 to the right&quot;. Or always to the left, depending on where you want to end up in: the total number of moves you have to do is 2^number of disks - 1 (which can easily be deduced from both binary and recursive description above), and the first and last moves are thus moves of disk 0. With a simple modulus 3 operation you realize which peg you end up in: with an odd number of disks your last move will be toward the same peg as your first move, with an even number of disk you will end on the other peg instead. Indeed all disk will move in a rotating fashion in the final solution, in alternating directions: if you move disk 0 to the right disk 1 will move to the left, disk 2 again to the right and so on. This will give you a hint on where the biggest disk, which is moved only once, will end up accordingly to the direction you choose for disk 0.<br><br>If your goal is to print the sequence of moves without having the actual puzzle then counting in binary will indeed help. But then you need an argument to figure out in which disk the peg is from the binary number: I&#39;ll add one here. Since the direction disk moves is easily predictable, you only have to count how many time each disk has been moved: in the binary representation this happens every time you flip its digit to 1, that is you can toss away the least significant digit and divide the number you obtain by two, approximating by excess. Example: if your count is 010011001 and you want to know how many time disk 4 has been moved, you can throw away 4 least significant digits (you don&#39;t care where disks smaller than it are) and get 01001, which is 9. This mean up until now you moved disk 4 and bigger 9 times, of which the odd moves disk 4 was moved, even moves you moved a bigger disk (you don&#39;t care which one now). Disk 4 has thus been moved 5 times, and thus it did almost one full rotation. As disk 4 is even it moves in the same direction of disk 0, hence if you move disk 0 to the right disk 4 is currently in the C peg, if you move it to the left it is in the B peg.", "comment_date": "2018-09-12T15:10:33Z", "likes_count": 2}, {"comment_by": "Khrisstian", "comment_text": "Post-rollover: move disk 0 right if the number of disks is even and move disk 0 left if the number of disks is odd.", "comment_date": "2018-09-03T03:20:55Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "D3X1K AXYZ", "comment_text": "This method may not actually work.(at least not for how i was taught and how you showed it off).

First of all, I love your videos, but I don&#39;t see how binary counting solves the towers of hanoi with the algorithm you have given simply because it does not guarantee that the tower moves from peg A to peg C. It seems to me that this will only happen when the tower is of even  height, the resulting stack will otherwise end up in the middle, and you need to compensate for that somehow. Am I missing something? The thing is that if you have to take care of this then the binary counting solution is not as clean and elegant as we might originally think. It&#39;s still pretty though, and I hadn&#39;t seen it before.<br><br>Personally, my favourite recursive algorithm for solving the towers of hanoi (which I am in no way taking credit for, but it is also optimal and moves any size tower to the right peg) is the following, where &#39;hanoi n to from via&#39; will solve the towers of hanoi by moving &#39;n&#39; discs from peg &#39;from&#39; to peg &#39;to&#39; via peg &#39;via&#39;. The results is a list of pairs [(A, C), (C, B), (A, B), ...] where every pair (A, B) means move the top disk of A to B.<br><br>hanoi n from to via =<br>  if n = 0 then <br>    []<br>  else<br>    (hanoi (n - 1) from via to)@<br>    (from, to)::<br>    (hanoi (n - 1) via to from)<br><br>here [] is the empty list, @ is list join, and :: is list addition.<br><br>If you call &#39;hanoi 3 A B C&#39;, for instance&#39; you will get the result [(A, C), (A, B), (C, B), (A, C), (B, A), (B, C), (A, C)] moving a tower of size 3 from peg A to peg C whereas your algorithm, if I read it correct, would move the tower from peg A to peg B.<br><br>As you noted, these algorithms get really tiny and are great for explaining recursion. We don&#39;t care how the smaller problem is solved, we just assume that it is and work from there ;).<br><br>I just found your channel (thanks to Ask a Game Dev) and I&#39;m looking forward to seeing your other work.

The way I always solved it was:<br>odd numbered tower/subtower -&gt; move next disc to destination you want the whole tower/subtower to be at<br>even number -&gt; move next disc to non-destination<br>This pattern works throughout the whole puzzle, and I assume it&#39;s basically the same as the binary thing, but harder to keep track of. I used to obsessively do this puzzle with playing cards (i didnt have pegs and rings), and i went up to 13 one time (took 2-3 hours I think?). Every new card would take about twice as long, I guess because 2^n (oh hey, binary!!)", "comment_date": "2016-11-25T19:04:21Z", "likes_count": 17}, {"comment_by": "Arongil Productions", "comment_text": "Super great video 3Blue1Brown!

So technically you could solve the tower with n pieces just by following what the binary tells you. Given the time anyone could solve any! And eventually get quicker. Had a competition in my class before where we had to solve the 7 bit one as fast as possible, my record was 12(!) seconds! Using an app though, so 2 quick taps was enough to make 1 move.
