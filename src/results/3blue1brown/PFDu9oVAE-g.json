The line of the argument tries to connect two equations @<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFDu9oVAE-g&amp;t=9m05s\">9:05</a> that:<br>The two forms ( from now onward I&#39;ll refer to as 1st form: A v = \u03bb v &amp; 2nd form: (A - I \u03bb ) v = 0 ) of the same equation have 2 different meanings and intuition. I am not able to connect or follow how one meaning is exactly the same as another. I think I have understood each equation&#39;s meaning individually but am not able to connect 2 different interpretations as one.<br><br>To elaborate on it, the 1st eqn (A v = \u03bb v), means that a good untouched transformative matrix that has non-zero determinant (now onwards det), transfers many vectors such that the nascent vector is a combined effect of scaling and/or shearing except for an Eigenvector(s). So, in this case, Eigenvector(s) v is that vector which when a transformative matrix A does its transformation, the v stays on its own span during and after the transformation.<br><br>The 2nd eqn ( (A - I \u03bb ) v = 0 ), means that the modified transformative matrix (A - I \u03bb) has a det 0, i.e., A transforms the current space in such a way that the transformed area of the region is zero (that is what det is about, the factor by which the area of any region changed when undergoing transformation by A as discussed in video chapter  6).<br><br>Why does an equation of a zero det Transformative matrix multiplied with a vector (i.e 2nd eqn ) is meaningfully the same as the equation of a Transformation of a vector v which when transforms only scales (1st eqn)? I am not feeling a connectedness or sameness to these 2 equations.<br><br>Also, I have gone through all the pre-requisite referred and recommended videos. Please, let me know what I am missing and how could I connect these two equations. <br><br>Note: Mathematically, I understand these two equations and how they connect through matrix operation but in terms of linear transformation and spaces I am in vacuum(pun intended).<br><br><br>It goes without saying that this is a masterpiece work of art and mathematics with altogether different level of ingenuity.<br><br><br>Thanks!", "comment_date": "2021-10-24T20:56:43Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "alan krak", "comment_text": "This is crazy.

Importantly, BALANCE and completeness go hand in hand.<br><br>Time DILATION ULTIMATELY proves ON BALANCE that ELECTROMAGNETISM/energy is gravity, as E=mc2 IS F=ma. This NECESSARILY represents, INVOLVES, AND DESCRIBES what is possible/potential AND actual IN BALANCE. Ultimately and truly, TIME is NECESSARILY possible/potential AND actual IN BALANCE; AS E=mc2 IS F=ma; AS ELECTROMAGNETISM/ENERGY IS GRAVITY. TIME CLEARLY necessitates and proves (ON BALANCE) that E=mc2 IS F=ma, AS ELECTROMAGNETISM/ENERGY IS GRAVITY. Gravity IS ELECTROMAGNETISM/energy. Great.<br><br>OVERLAY what is THE EYE in BALANCED RELATION to/WITH what is THE EARTH. Notice the black space of THE EYE. The stars AND PLANETS are POINTS in the night sky. THE DOME of a person&#39;s EYE is ALSO VISIBLE. Now, carefully consider what is the semi-spherical, translucent, QUANTUM GRAVITATIONAL, AND BLUE SKY. Great. E=mc2 IS F=ma. It is CLEAR. The BALANCE of being AND EXPERIENCE is essential. What is THE EYE is ALSO the body ON BALANCE. Objects fall at the SAME RATE (neglecting air resistance, of course), AS E=mc2 IS F=ma; AS ELECTROMAGNETISM/energy is gravity. Great !!! The EARTH/ground CLEARLY constitutes what is the FULL DISTANCE in/of SPACE. Now consider what is the blue sky. The Earth is ALSO BLUE as water. Gravity AND ELECTROMAGNETISM/energy are linked AND BALANCED opposites, AS E=MC2 IS F=ma; AS ELECTROMAGNETISM/energy is gravity. GREAT. This NECESSARILY represents, INVOLVES, AND DESCRIBES what is possible/potential AND actual IN BALANCE. Now, VERY CAREFULLY consider what is BALANCED BODILY/VISUAL EXPERIENCE. Great !!!!<br><br>Time DILATION ULTIMATELY proves (ON BALANCE) that E=mc2 IS F=ma, AS ELECTROMAGNETISM/ENERGY IS GRAVITY. Gravity/acceleration involves BALANCED inertia/INERTIAL RESISTANCE, AS E=mc2 IS F=ma; AS ELECTROMAGNETISM/energy is gravity. (Accordingly, the rotation of WHAT IS THE MOON matches it&#39;s revolution; AND the Moon is necessarily fixed or basically constant in it&#39;s form and shape.) &quot;Mass&quot;/ENERGY involves BALANCED inertia/INERTIAL RESISTANCE consistent with/AS what is BALANCED electromagnetic/gravitational force/ENERGY, AS ELECTROMAGNETISM/ENERGY IS GRAVITY; AS E=mc2 IS F=ma. (Energy has/involves GRAVITY, AND ENERGY has/involves inertia/INERTIAL RESISTANCE.) E=MC2 IS F=ma as what is the middle distance in/of SPACE in BALANCED RELATION to/WITH what is the FULL DISTANCE in/of SPACE, AS ELECTROMAGNETISM/energy is gravity. So, gravity IS ELECTROMAGNETISM/energy. Great. The stars AND PLANETS are POINTS in the night sky. GRAVITATIONAL force/ENERGY IS proportional to (or BALANCED with/as) inertia/INERTIAL RESISTANCE, AS ELECTROMAGNETISM/ENERGY IS GRAVITY; AS E=MC2 IS F=ma. Beautiful. Ultimately and truly, TIME is NECESSARILY possible/potential AND actual IN BALANCE; AS E=mc2 IS F=ma; AS ELECTROMAGNETISM/ENERGY IS GRAVITY. GREAT. Gravity IS ELECTROMAGNETISM/energy. It ALL CLEARLY makes perfect sense. A PHOTON may be placed at the center of what is THE SUN (as A POINT, of course), AS the reduction of SPACE is offset by (or BALANCED with) the speed of light; AS E=mc2 IS F=ma; AS ELECTROMAGNETISM/energy is gravity. Great.<br><br>THEREFORE:<br><br>E=MC2 AS F=MA CLEARLY PROVES (ON BALANCE) WHY AND HOW THE PROPER AND FULL UNDERSTANDING OF TIME (AND TIME DILATION) UNIVERSALLY ESTABLISHES THE FACT THAT ELECTROMAGNETISM/ENERGY IS GRAVITY:<br><br>A PHOTON may be placed at the center of what is THE SUN (as A POINT, of course), AS the reduction of SPACE is offset by (or BALANCED with) the speed of light; AS E=mc2 IS F=ma; AS ELECTROMAGNETISM/energy is gravity. Indeed, the stars AND PLANETS are POINTS in the night sky. E=mc2 IS F=ma. Gravity IS ELECTROMAGNETISM/energy. Time DILATION ULTIMATELY proves ON BALANCE that ELECTROMAGNETISM/energy is GRAVITY, AS E=mc2 IS F=ma. Indeed, TIME is NECESSARILY possible/potential AND actual IN BALANCE; AS ELECTROMAGNETISM/ENERGY IS GRAVITY; AS E=MC2 IS F=MA. Great. &quot;Mass&quot;/ENERGY IS GRAVITY. ELECTROMAGNETISM/ENERGY IS GRAVITY. E=mc2 IS F=ma. (Very importantly, outer &quot;space&quot; involves full inertia; AND it is fully invisible AND black.) BALANCE and completeness go hand in hand. It ALL CLEARLY makes perfect sense. I have mathematically unified physics/physical experience, as I have CLEARLY proven that E=mc2 IS F=ma in what is a truly universal and BALANCED fashion.<br><br>By Frank DiMeglio", "comment_date": "2021-02-13T10:56:38Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "H H", "comment_text": "Thank you", "comment_date": "2021-02-11T17:14:59Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Bhavna Nagar", "comment_text": "Visualization is some thing mathematics book lacks, they will explain you many proofs, theorems but not the essence of particular topic, these videos makes more sense", "comment_date": "2021-02-10T15:20:12Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Michelangelo Magada", "comment_text": "watching this the same way that Netflix its amazing", "comment_date": "2021-02-10T12:33:32Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Soham Bhattacharjee", "comment_text": "If anyone ever told me this is spectral decomposition!!!i am crying tears of joy...Sir Grant Sanderson...i have never had the opportunity to meet you ... probably will never even have any similar opportunity in future.... however i want you to know that you are one of the most amazing teachers i ever had.

Consider the following problem:<br> <br>You&#39;re in a financial arrangement whereby you give 25% of your savings (for the sake of simplicity, a one-time inheritance) every year--an account that makes 0.1% interest--to a bank that makes 10% interest from the money you provided, and returns 15% of their account value to your personal account at the end of each year. (The rest of the principal you offered, the bank keeps and continues to grow with the following year&#39;s investment.) Yes, you&#39;re giving more money than you&#39;re making at first, but the bank is making 100x what you would be, so it&#39;s a worthwhile investment in the long run--right? How fast is your money actually growing?<br> <br>This question can be easily answered by looking at the eigenvalues of the system matrix, because eigenvalues of a system matrix <b>are the rates at which that system progresses.</b> The dominant (largest) eigenvalue is around 1.068, implying that you&#39;ll be making 6.8% return off the arrangement in the long run.<br> <br>In this context, an imaginary eigenvalue/rate implies an oscillation, a negative rate implies a decay, and a positive rate implies a growth.

Here&#39;s what I&#39;ve discovered about the puzzle at the end. Observe that squaring A gives successive elements of the Fibonacci sequence F_n, so A^n = [[F_n-1, F_n], [F_n, F_n+1]]. An efficient way to compute A^n will also give an efficient way to compute F_n.Take the eigenbasis E = [[2, 2], [1 + sqrt(5), 1 - sqrt(5)]]. Now the matrix B = Einv * A * E gives a diagonal matrix, as you see in the video. It&#39;s easy to compute powers of this matrix, B^n, by squaring the elements. Taking the nth power of matrices of this form is actually equivalent to squaring the matrix in the middle and then multiplying by the matrices on the left and right, since B^n = (Einv * A * E)^n = (Einv * A * E) * (Einv * A * E) * ... * (Einv * A * E) = Einv * A^n * E. To understand the last step, note that the Es and Einvs cancel each other out when you rearrange the brackets. Finally, we can multiply B^n by E and Einv, and out pops A^n: E * B^n * Einv = E * Einv * A^n * E * Einv = A^n. Which gives us the nth Fibonacci number.<br><br>(Edit: corrected typo in A^n).", "comment_date": "2019-12-19T17:45:38Z", "likes_count": 78}, {"comment_by": "Shamim Ibne Shahid", "comment_text": "&#39; all the basis vectors are eigen vectors &#39; --- what does this mean though?

We learn it because it is extremely useful in describing the world around us, and because we will need it in our careers that require manipulating the world around us in order to eat. I personally do find this orderly correspondence to the real world to be beautiful and mysterious, but pure math with no applications to me means little more than logical masturbation. It is not something that can be easily appreciated without having the privilege of years of study in which to gain that appreciation, unlike music and visual art, which are generally intrinsically pleasing to the senses without the requirement of a master&#39;s degree. So that quote is a false analogy. This series turns math into visual art, thereby making it much easier to appreciate, as numerous commenters have stated, so obviously none of this ire is directed at 3Blue1Brown.<br><br>Speaking as a community college student, I find it to be the height of arrogance when pure mathematicians working as professors expect the common student, who does not have the luxury of a cushy tenured faculty position to fall back on to make ends meet, to immediately respect these unapplied ideas, abstract symbols on a board. In fact, in my experience, these professors&#39; stubborn views actually make math less beautiful to the common student, as they make it less approachable, and more time-intensive, boring and painful to study, requiring more memorization of concepts and definitions than visual/applicable intuitions. So these professors are shooting themselves in the foot if they really want their students to gain an appreciation of the elegance of math. Reading so many comments about so many professors teaching this way, it saddens me to think of all the human potential that evaporated in all these classrooms when students lost the plot in upper math classes and lost interest. We deserve better teaching methodologies, for the benefit of humanity.<br>/rant<br><br><br>P.S. These geometric interpretations go a long way in helping us (visual learners at least) visualize how we can apply these concepts, so thank you for being a force for the democratization of upper level math.

It would be nice to calculate without any run-time effort the k-th power of A instead of handling dozens of matrix multiplications of the type A*A*A..., which is why we want to find another way to simplify the calculation.<br><br>The given eigenvectors in the excercise are linearly independet, which means, we can build up an eigenbasis (a basis, only using eigenvectors) of the vector space of A (which is R^2). This is useful because we can now use this basis to replace the transformation of A with an equal transformation, which is easier to calculate with.<br><br>So how do we do that? Im first going to explain, what we are going to do and at the end, why it simplifies our calculation.<br>We represent a given vector which should be transformed using the basis of eigenvectors. <br>In other words, we transform a vector with a matrice into a linear combination of eigenvectors. To describe this matrice we describe the standard basis vectors of the R^2-space using B.<br>Then, we multiply the output of our first step with a matrice, which describes the transformation of A for vectors related to the eigenbasis.<br>Afterwards we transform the result back into a vector based on the basis of A.<br><br>What we basically did, was: A*v = ((GoBackToA)*(ActuallyCalculate&quot;*v&quot;)*(TransformToEigenBasis))*v.<br>It should be obvious by now, that (GoBackToA) equals (TransformtoEigenBasis^-1) and <br>A equals (GoBackToA)*(ActuallyCalculate)*(TransformToEigenBasis). <br>So why does this help? Well first let&#39;s have a look at the nice representation of A^k here.<br><br>A^k = ((GoBackToA)*(ActuallyCalculate)*(TransformToEigenBasis))^k =<br>((TransformToEigenBasis^-1)*(ActuallyCalculate)*(TransformToEigenBasis))^k =  ?<br><br>==&gt; (TTE := TransformToEigenBasis, AC := ActuallyCalculate, I2 := IdentityMatrice (2-dimensional))<br>(TTE^-1 * AC * TTE) * (TTE^-1 * AC * TTE) * (TTE^-1 * AC * TTE) <b>...</b> (TTE^-1 * AC * TTE) * (TTE^-1 * AC * TTE) =<br>TTE^-1 * AC * (TTE * TTE^-1) * AC * (TTE * TTE^-1) * AC * ... * AC * (TTE * TTE^-1) * AC * TTE =<br>TTE^-1 * AC * I2 * AC * I2 * AC <b>...</b> AC * I2 * AC * TTE =<br>TTE^-1 * AC^k * TTE<br><br>And here is the clue. AC^k is in contrary to A^k very easy to compute. AC is a matrice which represents the transformation of A in terms of an eigenbasis. Vectors of an eigenbasis can be represented by a linear combination of eigenvectors. Eigenvectors only get scaled when they are multiplied with A.<br>Which is why a transformation, where each coordinate of the transformed vector is based on a linear combination of eigenvectors, only scales those coordinates - notwithstanding if the vector, which is transformed is an eigenvector or not. This leads to the conclusion that AC has to be diagonal. AC^k is thus very easily calculated by taking every entry unequal to zero to the power of k.<br><br>There is a mathematical theorem, which claims the following: A is diagonalizable if the dimension of each eigenspace (the so called geometric multiplicity) equals the so called algebraic multiplicity (multiplicity of the eigenvalue in the characteristic polynomial) of its eigenvalue. <br>Furthermore (real) symmetric matrices are always diagonalizable.", "comment_date": "2018-07-20T11:00:24Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Olivier Nadeau", "comment_text": "Thanks, quantum physics changed from pure magic to magic with some logic here and there.", "comment_date": "2018-07-18T15:49:03Z", "likes_count": 4}, {"comment_by": "deadmeat1471", "comment_text": "Brilliant video.", "comment_date": "2018-07-17T13:20:19Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Poor Little Sheep", "comment_text": "I think this should legitimately be put under medical category of Youtube instead of science, because it literally, saves lives.", "comment_date": "2018-07-17T06:30:39Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Juan Juarez", "comment_text": "You&#39;re amazing", "comment_date": "2018-07-15T21:44:16Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Matthew Stringer", "comment_text": "Can you explain generalized eigenvectors?", "comment_date": "2018-07-12T06:33:19Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Christelle Gloor", "comment_text": "I am revisiting LinAlg (a subject I took in the first year of my Bachelors 5 years ago and narrowly failed) for my Machine Learning course and these videos are incredibly helpful!

This is why <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFDu9oVAE-g&amp;t=11m34s\">11:34</a> is so interesting to me: the Hamiltonian operator \u0124=\u2013(i\u0127\u00b2/2m)\u2207\u00b2+V(\ud835\udc00) involves a complex scalar \u2013i\u0127\u00b2/2m, but gives a real eigenvalue when applied to the wavefunction \u03c8(\ud835\udc00). This video actually gave me a new (for me) insight into that equation: because \u03c8(\ud835\udc00) is a complex-valued function, if we see the operator as a complex transformation from the complex plane onto the real numbers, then \u0124 is essentially the transformation that rotates the complex plane such that the complex values for \u03c8(\ud835\udc00) are &quot;scaled&quot; along some complex analog of their span, which I suppose must include part of the set of real numbers.<br><br>Am I anywhere close?

This video, in particular, posed a challenge to me, for which the story begins in October, when I first found the series.<br><br>I watched the entire series over the course of around 2 days. (How could I not? It&#39;s so good!) Going through it quickly was great, and I learned a ton, but I found myself unable to solve the problem at the end of this video. Perhaps the problem stemmed from some shaky foundational concept from going quickly through the series. Regardless, I couldn&#39;t solve it.<br><br>Fast forward a few months, and I decided to re-watch the series. This was two days ago. It has been fantastic to watch, and I did many problems along with the videos to solidify my understanding. Viewing everything after having seen it already was definitely a good idea, because so many concepts from chapter 3 and 4 to this chapter have totally clicked in me now.<br><br>So I decided to retry the problem at the end of this video. I worked, beginning in the morning, and ending in the evening, though, importantly, not straight. I would try for twenty minutes, take a break to do something, return, and so on. To keep this paragraph relatively short, I restarted from scratch maybe 4 times total, after extensive calculation (everything, including inverses and matrix multiplication: there&#39;s a reason computers exist!) for whatever method I was on.<br><br>By the 4th or 5th iteration, just before dinner, I had completed the calculations, and had attained enlightening ideas of how to use eigenvectors.

(the reason we are doing this seems that it reveals an easier way to talk about the transformation A itself, like a rotation around the axis that happens to be the eigenvector). We want to find the <b>*family*</b> of vectors that make Av = lambda v true which is the same as finding (Av - lambda I) v = 0 true. That explanation seems a bit more satisfying than just saying &quot;v is boring&quot;. Since 0 is part of every family of vectors for any transformation A, just saying v = 0 is a solution is beyond boring, its uninformative. Since 0 is in any set of vectors for any A that makes Av = lambda v true, its really useless to point out that 0 is a solution. <br><br>Just seems saying boring doesn&#39;t really provide the a good intuition on why the obvious solution is not what we are looking for. <br><br>You could even emphasize it by saying that finding 0 doesn&#39;t really find the <b>true family</b> of vectors that when transformed by A leave it unchanged. Or with the example you already had. 0 isn&#39;t really the axis of rotation...or its the axis of rotation of any rotation matrix A, so finding the solution v=0 doesn&#39;t actually provide information about the transformation encoded by A...not sure if there are other ways of saying why v = 0 isn&#39;t what we are looking for (note I am explicitly avoiding the word boring or non interesting since that explanation to me leads to more questions than to answers).", "comment_date": "2016-11-01T21:42:59Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Kevin Byrne", "comment_text": "I have been studying this subject for years.

Eigenbasis is that reference point, and changing from the normal basis vector (Earth) to the Eigenbasis vectors (Sun) can simplify calculations in a similar way. <br><br>Another analogy (that\u2019s a bit out there) is that when you high-five someone, you have a much higher chance of nailing it if you track their elbows instead of their palms because the palms are moving a lot more and are thus harder to track. Changing your tracking point from the palms (normal basis vector/Earth) to the elbows (Eigenbasis vector/Sun) reduces the tracking complexity which helps you nail the high-five more easily. <br><br>One more analogy: I\u2019m in India and my friend is in the U.S. If we agree to have a video chat online and begin discussing a whole bunch of dates and times, it will simplify my job to convert from my time (normal basis vector) to his time in the US (Eigenbasis vector), do all the calculations in his time and translate ONLY the final date, the final result of all the calculations, to my time (back to normal basis from Eigenbasis).<br><br>Hope this was useful to someone.", "comment_date": "2016-09-16T08:15:45Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "david21686", "comment_text": "Mmmk.
