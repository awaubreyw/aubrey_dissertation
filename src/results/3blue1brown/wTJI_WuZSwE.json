Because there are only n colors to choose from, two of these vertices must be the same color. If the pair of two vertices that are the same color does not include vertex x, then x will have two neighbors of the same color which necessarily means that it does not have a neighbor of whatever color x is. By extension, this only gets worse if x shares a color with more than one neighbor.<br>Simplification of assertion: any vertex will have one edge which connects it to a vertex of the same color. Let us call these vertexes \u201cshare edges\u201d because their two vertexes share a color.<br>Expansion of simplification of assertion: two share edges may not share a vertex (because then the shared vertex would share a color with more than one of its neighbors)<br>Extraction from above: therefore, all share edges must be parallel (assuming the n cube has all right angles)<br><br>Find the maximum number of unique parallel edges on the n cube (can\u2019t think of a reason why, other than because it will do the following).

It took my a bit over two days of pondering to come to a solution. So the first goal of problem is to find a way expressing the position of the key with the arrangement of the board. Without loss of generality, this is equivalent to finding a function that computes a number mod 64 using 64 input values mod 2. We also have the added constraint that we must be able to vary the output of the function by any n mod 64 by only changing one of the inputs. Naturally it makes sense to try and simplify this function. Since any number mod 64 is representable by a 6 length bitstring, we rewrite the function as f:Z_2^64 -&gt; Z_2^6. The goal here is be able to choose which values in the 6 length bitstring to flip based on changing a single input value. The solution I came up with was the hypercube in R^6 formed by the Cartesian product of {0,1}^6. We assign a bit value to each point in this subspace and we label the axis x_1, x_2, x_3\u2026, x_6. The value for the nth digit in the bit string is equivalent to the bit value at the origin plus the sum of bit values were the dot product between the position of the bitvalue and x_n is non zero. In more simple terms, for each position (a,b,c,d,e,f) the first digit of the bitstring is equivalent to the bitvalue at the origin plus the sum of all the bitvalues of positions where a =\\= 0. This gives us a unique way of attaining any length 6 bitstring by just choosing which input to flip. Thus, for any original arrangement of the board, we can flip a single coin such that the function of the resulting board gives us the position of the key.<br><br><br>Grant may also notice that this actually works for any board nxm such that nm is a power k of 2 since this way, each bitstring representation of a board position corresponds to a unique point in {0,1}^k.<br><br><br>Edit: I finished watching the video. Feels nice to not only provide nothing new to the insight of the solution, but have Grant describe the pigeon hole proof for boards that are not 2^n, that I gave up looking for after 2 hours, in the most intuitive way possible.

I watched the first part a few weeks ago and have come back to see if my solution matches yours. I came up with something different than the solution you discuss with Matt. Interestingly, my solution provides a different way of glimpsing into which configurations may or may not be possible. Here&#39;s what I did:<br>\r<br>Take the parity of each row, and the parity of each column. Each is an eight-bit sequence. Note that by choosing a coin on the main grid to flip, we can selectively switch any one bit of the &quot;row parity&quot; sequence and any one bit of the &quot;column parity&quot; sequence. We now have a new challenge (or rather, two identical challenges): With our eight bits of &quot;row parity&quot;, flip exactly one of them to communicate the row containing the key. And independently do the same for the columns. Hm... This feels like a familiar puzzle. In fact it&#39;s the same one as the original with only eight coins! Done twice!\r<br>\r<br>I&#39;m still stuck. Eight is a lot. But... If we arrange THOSE eight in a 2x4 board, and take the parity of the rows and columns of THAT, we can reduce this eight-coin puzzle to a four-coin version and a two-coin version in the very same way we reduced the original! And that four-coin version can be reduced further by laying it out in a 2x2 grid to get two 2-coin versions. At that point, solve by hand. For me I arbitrarily decided that 00 and 10 point to the first coin, and 01 or 11 point to the second.\r Bubble up these smaller puzzles to eventually find which coin of the row-sequence needs to flip, and which of the column-sequence to flip, and then flip the corresponding coin in the big chess board.<br>\r<br>I imagine that my solution implicitly is just selecting a different way to partition the board into the six regions overlapping regions you discuss with Matt. What&#39;s fun is trying my solution on different board sizes. A 6x6 looks easy! Take each row and column, let&#39;s lay THOSE out in a 2x3 and... hm. I also struggled to color my 3-color cube before deciding it was a no-go. In terms of generalizing my solution, we can say that an N-tile board is solvable if each of N&#39;s prime factors is &quot;solvable&quot; (since we factor it down with each cris-cross reduction). I&#39;d guess from your video that 2 is the only such solvable prime - which means the powers of 2 are the only viable boards!<br><br>Thanks so much for this treasured riddle.

I&#39;m not saying its a good or practical solution but here is my thought process: Lets start with a &quot;board&quot; with two squares: Here you have 2^2=4 initial states for the coins on the board. For every state there are 2 different positions for the key, which gives us a total of 8 cases. Now we make a list of these 8 cases and assign for each one a new state of the board (=&gt; &quot;label&quot;), that can be reached by turning exactly one coin. Finally we assign for each such &quot;label&quot; a key position, as follows (1&#39; means that the key is under the coin, that shows tales):\r<br>\r<br>1  1&#39;  =&gt;  1  0  meaning &quot;key is under the 2nd square&quot;\r<br>1&#39; 1   =&gt;  0  1  meaning &quot;key is under the 1st square&quot;\r<br>1  0&#39;  =&gt;  0  0  meaning &quot;key is under the 2nd square&quot;\r<br>1&#39; 0   =&gt;  1  1  meaning &quot;key is under the 1st square&quot;\r<br>0  1&#39;  =&gt;  0  0  meaning (again) &quot;key is under the 2nd square&quot;\r<br>0&#39; 1   =&gt;  1  1  meaning (again) &quot;key is under the 1st square&quot;\r<br>0  0&#39;  =&gt;  1  0  meaning (again) &quot;key is under the 2nd square&quot;\r<br>0&#39; 0   =&gt;  0  1  meaning (again) &quot;key is under the 1st square&quot;\r<br>\r<br>Note that we can re-use the same &quot;label&quot; multiple times, if we can reach it by turning one coin and if it is shows the correct key-position. Each &quot;label&quot; can be used exactly twice in the 2-squares-board-example. So the 4 states (&quot;labels&quot;) are good enough to describe the 8 cases.\r<br>\r<br>It then becomes evident that this only works on a board with a number of squares = n^2, because otherwise the number of original states (in the case of 3 squares this would be 3^2=8) does not divide well by the number of key-positions (this would be 3), resulting in a mess.\r<br>\r<br>With the chess board the prisoners simply have to assign every of the 64^2x64=262&#39;144 cases with one of the 64^2=4096 labels (i. e. each label is used exactly 64 times) and memorising for each label the assigned key-position.

The squares patterns have very specific rules alright. There are going to be 4 main patterns to look for going clockwise, and each square will have each corner perfectly equidistance from each other, the smallest possible pattern will be the correct one. Furthermore the square will always begin from the top left corner of the board. From here on I will use t for tails and h for heads in sequence to determine the going from top left at the start of the sequence and the rest will follow clockwise. The  first type of pattern is diagonals,  thth would determine the key is under the bottom right. Htht would be top left. Next is a three to one ratio of squares. Hthh would be top right and ttth would be bottom left. Next will be all heads or all tails, this one is a fail safe with the intention of being the most obvious with the intention of being the largest possible pattern you can find. All heads mean there will be a new pattern that will start in the middle of the top segment of the square currently made and all tails mean the pattern starts in the center of the square.The last pattern will be used in the event that he sets the key under a square that is already set up in a wrong pattern for where the key is, for example, a ttth pattern with the key on top right. If the square is a hhtt pattern it will be top right, thht will be bottom right, tthh will be bottom left and htth will always be top left. The patterns come in a priority, three to one comes first, full square comes second, half and half comes second, and diagonals come third.

The choice of a chessboard is significant because it has 64 squares. But to be a truly great puzzle, all the relevant properties of a chessboard should be significant, not just the number of squares. A chessboard can be rotated 180 degrees and it will look the same. If Prisoner 2 is led into the room and he notices that the room is 180-degree symmetrical with two entrance doors, and it also so happens that the arrangement of heads and tails is similarly symmetrical (ie a palindrome when written as a sequence),  then he only has a 50% chance, no matter what he has previously discussed with Prisoner 1. There is absolutely no way to know whether he is looking at the board from the same side as Prisoner 1 was. So it&#39;s a choice between square x , and square (63-x), and those can&#39;t be the same square. So to solve the problem, Prisoner 1 would have to never leave a palindrome. He can certainly avoid leaving a palindrome, but that removes some of his options, and he doesn&#39;t have any spare options.

Depends on how you look at it. If you go by rows then one can put at the end of each row the probability of variance from 50/50 i.e. the probability of getting 3H and 5 tails is much less than 4H and 4T and much more than 2H and 6T.   One can then do the same calculation by comparing columns, as well one can do &#39;diagonals&#39; in both directions.

Grant, if you read this then please comment &lt;3 <br>The theory: H*e_i can be any vector in the space of the parity check matrix by the definition of H, so obviously you can pick an e_i such that H*e_i = H*L - H*x, where x is the board encoded as a word (not a codeword), e_i is a one-hot vector with a 1 at index i that denotes the single coin to flip, H*L is the location of the key (read down the vector as if it were binary), and H is the parity check matrix of the hamming code... <br>.<br>The solution:<br>- The player who saw the key go in the hole picks e_i according to the above, i.e. e_i such that H*e_i = H*L - H*x. If the syndrome of x is already the syndrome of L, i.e. H*L = H*x and you don&#39;t want to make a change / want e_i to just be 0, let e_i = the vector corresponding to the top left corner (or whatever square was defined to multiply the zero vector), which gets encoded as the 0 vector so there&#39;s no issue. <br>- The other player who needs to find where the key is decodes the location as H*x&#39; = H*L (again, read down the vector as if it were binary), where x&#39; is the new board after the flip.<br>.<br>The main intuition is that Hamming Codes are of size 2^r - 1, and we have 2^r squares, so if we encode the board as a number then one of the squares multiplies the zero vector.

In other words, the second prisoner needs to know a partition of the set of states, say V, into 64 subsets say V1, V2,...,V64.<br>Then, if the state he is confronted with is in the subset Vi, he will choose position i.<br><br>Of course, not any partition will work since we also have to take into account the actual game: the first prisoner has be able to prepare the state accordingly by just flipping a single coin, starting from an arbitrary position. In other words, the partition needs to have the property that it is possible to move from one subset Vi to another subset Vj by just flipping a single coin.<br><br>This is a remarkable and rare property of such a partition! And a remarkable property calls for a remarkable solution.<br><br>Luckily, there is an extremely pretty mathematical way of creating partitions (to fast forward: by using orbits under a group action, or by using the quotient space construction in linear algebra)! But for this, we need to actually do math, and use the nice structure of the set of states.<br><br>The set of states V is not only a plain old set, but it can be given the structure of a vector space. In particular, it is possible to define an addition on the set of states! How is this possible? First, for convenience, let us rename Heads to 0 and Tails to 1. Now, we can actually add Heads and Tails using our standard arithmetic, but with a slight twist. Clearly 0+0, and 1+0=1. The small twist is, that 1+1=0, as there is no 2 around. Now to add two states, we simply apply this rule to every of the 64 positions on the board.<br><br>For example, if our board would be much smaller (2x2) a possible addition would look like this:<br><br>1  |  0      0  |  1     1  |  1<br>--------  +  --------- = ------------<br>1  |   1     0 |   1     1  |  0<br> <br>So I applied the addition rule from above 4 times. Neat isn&#39;t it? The same of course works for the big 8x8 board, but it would be a lot of work to put an example in a Youtube comment. Note, that the act of flipping a coin can now be done by addition! Namely, if I want to flip the coin at position i, I can do this by adding the state which is all 0, but 1 in position I (we will can this state ei, why not). Even neater!<br><br>Now, let us first find the set C=V1, so the set of states, which would correspond to the key being in position 1 on the board.<br>I call this set C, since here linear codes come into play!<br><br>First, a reasonable assumption is that all the sets V1,..,Vn, should have the same size. So C should have size 2^64/64=2^64/2^5=2^58. Here we are lucky that the number of position on the board is a power of 2, hahaha!<br>Second, the next assumption I will make is that C is a subspace, that is, closed under addition. In other words, if I have two states in C and add them together, they should be in C again. This makes C really nice and symmetric, and also tractable for the methods of linear algebra.<br>Third, I will assume that the state e1=(1,0,0,0,0,0......) is in C. This will catch the annoying case that the warden puts the key in position 1 and the coins in a position already in C, but we are sill forced to flip a coin. Then we will simply flip the first coin, and stay in our subset C, haha! To specify C, which will have 2^58=A LOT, of elements, I will simply give a list of 58 elements v1,....,v58 in C, and then say: C consists of all possible sums one can form with this 58 elements (including the 0 state which is all 0).\u00a0<br>Fifth, the magic happens: I want to construct a C with the following property: all elements in C (apart from the state 0=(0,0,....) and e1=(1,0,0,0,...)) should have at least 3 non-zero entries. This is possible in the following way.\u00a0<br><br>First v1=e1, only 57 more to go! The next 57 states will all be of the neat form v2=e2+w2, v3=e3+w3, ...., v58=e58+w58 with the following restriction: the states w2 to w58 should be all 0 in the first 58 positions and should contain at least 2 ones in the positions 59-64. In fact, there are exactly 2^6-6-1+57 such possible states w (here again, we are so luckyyyy). So we simply take all of them, in any order we like hahaha.<br><br>Now, believe it or not, we are done. Let me explain why. So first, let me specify the other sets V_2,...V_64. So the set V_2 will be e2+C, which is simply a notation for all vector which are e2 plus some state c in C. The set V3 will be e3+C, and so on!<br>Second, we observe that all the sets V1,...,Vn, do not overlap. Assume that there would be such an overlap, say the state v would be in Vi and Vj. Then v=ei+c and also v=ej+d for states c and d in C. By simply manipulating this equations, we have c+d=ei+ej, so this means that ei+ej is in C. But this is impossible! We constructed C in a way that every state in C (apart from 0 and e1) has more than 2 non-zero entries.<br><br>That forces our choice of V1, V2,...V64 is indeed a partition of V.<br><br>All that is left show is that one can get from any subset to any other subset with one coin-flip. Ok, first, it is easy to get from a state in V1=C to any other set Vi, simply by flipping the coin at position i which is just the same as adding the vector ei.<br>Now let me also argue, that is must be possible to get from an arbitrary state in an arbitrary Vi to a state in an arbitrary Vj. First, if i=j, I simply flip coin 1 (it is easy to see that this work, think about it!). Else, I claim that there must be one flip doing the right thing. Assume that flipping the coins 2,...,64 all DO NOT bring you to the right Vj. Then, by the &quot;pidgeonhole principle&quot;, or whatever people call this, a must 2 different positions of flips, say k and l, bringing you into the same subset Vm, for m not equal to j. In other words, ei+c+ek=ei+d+el, for some states c and d in C. This means that ek+el is in C, which is again impossible.<br><br>So we see that the solution works! It involves linear algebra, the field with two elements, codes and such, but I hope that one can still appreciate<br>and understand it without knowing those things!", "comment_date": "2020-07-12T16:14:07Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Vinit Sinha", "comment_text": "Make a video on tetrations.", "comment_date": "2020-07-12T14:35:21Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "M.

For example, in the three-coin case, if we need to add 2, we could either flip the 2-coin to a 1 (heads, if heads is encoded to 1) or flip the 1-coin to a 0 (tails); the only way to fail at this is if the 2-coin is already heads and the 1-coin is already tails, which has a random probability of 1/4. It seems as though this logic doesn&#39;t depend on the number of coins because there&#39;s always two ways to get to any number modulo N either by adding or subtracting an element of Z/nZ (unless maybe we need to add n/2, in which case either adding or subtracting will work, which seems to suggest this strategy will always succeed in that &quot;lucky&quot; case, but I&#39;m not sure), so it seems like our odds are always 75% with this strategy. But is it possible to come up with a strategy that, in general, has a <b>more</b> than 75% of succeeding? As we&#39;ve shown, 100% is impossible if the number of coins is not a power of 2, but maybe if we remove the restriction that the warden is evil and knows our strategy and is instead &quot;neutral&quot; and assigns a board configuration randomly, it could be possible to come up with a strategy that has at least a higher chance of winning than, say, Russian roulette (as mentioned in Matt&#39;s video).", "comment_date": "2020-07-09T03:04:44Z", "likes_count": 3}, {"comment_by": "Miguel Anjo", "comment_text": "easy. just say you&#39;ll always flip the top right corner or something.

I made a transition table for a 2x2 board. I mapped the table to a one dimensional string of length 4 to make it easy. This leads to 16 possibilities. It is obvious that to each initial state there are exactly 4 possible target state. But the total target states are 16. So to transmit the necessary information to the second prisoner, the initial state does not matter. As there are only 4 key locations, we can define a map table with a triplet of (initial state, key location, target state). We can easily find a way to chose one and only one target state to every initial state per key location, so to distribute it evenly among initial states. There is also a formula or an algorithm to make this but I didn&#39;t work it out. So the strategy for a 2x2 board is to give the second prisoner a table where the 16 target combinations are divided in 4 groups, each group matching to a specific key location. This is why only 2^n boards have a solution. The possibilities for a 8x8 board are 2^64. The second prisoner needs an algorithm to find out the key location because he cannot learn the distribution table without a computer. There comes the error correction idea. The second prisoner will consider that the board offered to him is a 64 bit string with only one erred bit. He have to find the erred bit location of a 64 bit string and there will be the key.

Let the chessboard cells be numbered A_k, where k goes from 0 (cell a8 in chess parlance) to 63 (cell h1 in chess parlance).  K can be written in binary notation as k_5, k_4, ..., k_0.  So, the chess cell b6 would be a_17, or written A_010001.  To compute b_i, take the parity of the number of Heads in a set of A&#39;s chosen by selecting K&#39;s where in binary notation k_i is equal to 1.  Thus, B_0 is the parity of all odd A&#39;s, that is simply the parity of all black cells of the board.  B_1 is the parity of all pairs of cells starting with a8-b8, e8-f8, c7-d7, g7-h7, ..., g1-h1. B_2 the parity over all blocs of 4 cells starting with a8-d8, e7-h7, a6-d6, ... etc.<br><br>You will notice that by flipping A_k you change all B&#39;s where b_i is equal to 1 when k_i equals 1. So if you flip the chess cell b6, also known as A_010001, you will change the value of b_0 and of b_4 but not any other of the b&#39;s.  If you flip the chess cell a8, the cell also known as A_000000, you don&#39;t change any of the B&#39;s, and that means that the board location was already telling you the location of the key.  Since you can change any of the chess cells you can change any combination of the b_i&#39;s, and alter the number B at will to point at the correct key location.<br><br>How I got there, in a nutshell: i was looking for classes of board states that were accessible from any state by a single flip. That led me to solving the 2-cell board quite easily.  The 4-cell board was harder, i solved it by visualizing a hypercube, each state being an apex, and flipping a one-step along a vertex.  So I needed 4 sets of 4 apexes that were all reachable from any starting state.  The hypercube can be visualized as a smaller normal cube nested inside a larger one, with corresponding corners connected. In this image it becomes evident that two corresponding corners of the twin cubes, plus their total opposites, make up a set of 4 reachable by a single vertex from any apex in the hypercube.  The other 3 classes are obtained by starting at another corner on the base of the twin cubes.  Once I had that solution I realized that the key location could also be described in terms of relationships between the digits of some indexes and that you could have a solution where a correct key location could be conserved by flipping A_00.  Looking at the 64 board it made me think of 63=1+2+4+8+16 (removing the cell that could be flipped with no harm) and that made the grouping and thereafter the solution obvious..", "comment_date": "2020-07-08T15:19:43Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Luigi Sgl", "comment_text": "If the coins are randomly flipped, there is no way to reliably encode enough information to indicate the key position in it just by flipping one coin.", "comment_date": "2020-07-08T15:16:19Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Jonathan Lima", "comment_text": "Man, the animations are amazing!<br>The transitions in different dimensions, Even the detail of word colouring in different colours.", "comment_date": "2020-07-08T15:05:47Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Gab Ben", "comment_text": "Hey !

I am not sure if there are earlier versions, but here is one possible source for the problem! <br><br>If anyone is wondering, in the official solution there is no explicit strategy given for the generic N=2^n case, but they show that a strategy exists by proving that if a strategy exists for N=a and N=b, then there is a strategy for N=ab.

There are b ways of doing this, one per column, as one can pick any coin on the row. <br><br>But at the same time, by symmetry, I can indicate one of the b columns, using the fact that a strategy for N=b exists, by changing an element in the appropriate column.

If you&#39;re interested in the topic, for reference material I&#39;d recommend &quot;Analysis of the information theoretically secret key agreement by public discussion&quot; by Wang et. al. for a general overview of the existing public work on the topic (the BPIAD protocol mentioned in this paper is a great practical example of using information inequality in your favour in the presence of an eavesdropper, and is easy to visualise because it works with bit pairs), &quot;Inequalities for Entropies of Sets of Subsets of Random Variables&quot; by Chao Tian for a nice generalisation of Han&#39;s inequality, Han&#39;s 1978 paper &quot;Nonnegative entropy measures of multivariate symmetric\r correlations&quot; itself, for obvious reasons, and &quot;Elements of Information Theory&quot; by Cover &amp; Thomas if you find yourself looking for background reference material that covers all the bases (although the chapters on Kolmogorov complexity and network information theory are probably the most relevant here).", "comment_date": "2020-07-06T17:31:38Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "WindFisher", "comment_text": "Love this and great set up of this unusual split video was enticing enough at least for me to get the viewer to watch both channel video.", "comment_date": "2020-07-06T17:30:38Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Ray Redondo", "comment_text": "I feel like a video on Hamming codes could be a collab with Ben Eater; he&#39;s doing a series on error correction in hardware<br><br>Great video as always!

A possible solution to this puzzle is to label the the cells of the 8x8 board from 0 to 63 (we do this because we are putting our computer science hats on and start counting from 0). We then note the labels of each cell holding a coin with heads (or tails ... it doesn&#39;t matter) facing up. Convert each of those labels into its corresponding 6 bit integer (note that every cell on the board is in one to one correspondence with a binary string of length 6) and XOR all those integers ALONG WITH the label of the cell holding the secret key location. Now convert the result back into an integer which points to the cell holding the coin you should now flip. When your friend looks at the board, he/she will then (using the same labeling as you) XOR all the cells with heads facing up (or tail ... if that was what you used earlier). The final XOR result will be the cell location holding the key! For those not familiar with XORing two numbers, you basically need to line up the two 6-bit integers and look at each column where if you see two 1\u2019s or two 0\u2019s you write a 0 below and write 1 otherwise. Another interpretation is to write a 0 if the two bits are the same and write a 1 if the two bits are different. For example, 111000 XOR 010101 = 101101. You can play around with this strategy, by using a programming language. To XOR two numbers N and M you typically would need to type \u201cN ^ M\u201d.<br><br>\u00a0To see the connection to computer science, check out an encryption technique called a &quot;One Time Pad.&quot; It works exactly through XORs similar to the solution of this puzzle. Let&#39;s say you want to encrypt a message, M, to send your friend, and supposed it is N bits long. For a secure encryption, you and your friend should generate a (uniformly) random N bit key, K, beforehand. Then to generate your ciphertext, C, you should compute C = K XOR M (or M XOR K because XOR is commutative which is fairly straightforward to verify). Then your friend would compute C XOR K (or K XOR C) to reveal the message M! The reason this works is because K XOR K always equals 0 for any choice of K (in technical terms K is called the &quot;inverse&quot; of K) and 0 XOR C always equals C for any choice of C (in technical terms 0 is called the \u201cidentity\u201d). In addition to being commutative, XOR is also associative. If these properties sound very familiar, it is because it is! XOR sounds kinda like a special addition where negative numbers are just the numbers themselves! With this in mind, I\u2019ll use \u201c+\u201d to denote XOR for brevity. Putting this all together, we know that C = K + M and that when revealing your message your friend will compute C + K = K + C = K + (K + M) = 0 + M = M!<br><br>\u00a0How does this relate to the Devil\u2019s Chessboard? Well we can think of XORing all the cells with heads (I will ignore the situation where we use tails instead but the analysis is the same) as our \u201ckey\u201d K and the key location being our message M. Formally, let K = X_1 + \u2026 + X_N where X_i is a cell with heads facing up and let M be the cell holding the key location. To generate our \u201cciphertext\u201d which will be the cell holding the coin we flip, we perform as stated above C = K + M. The ingenuity of this solution lies in the fact that when your friend comes in and performs the XORing procedure stated above, he/she will compute C + K which as seen before will expose our message M! To see why this is case, note that either C will have been turned from tails to heads or turned from heads to tails. In the first case, your friend will see X_1, \u2026, X_N, and C as heads and compute X_1 + \u2026 + X_N + C = K + C. In the second case, C will have flipped a coin that was previously heads (call this X_j), and your friend will then compute X_1 + \u2026 + X_(j-1) + X_(j+1) + \u2026 X_N =  X_1 + \u2026 + X_(j-1) + 0 + X_(j+1) + \u2026 X_N =  X_1 + \u2026 + X_(j-1) + (X_j + X_j) + X_(j+1) + \u2026 X_N = K + C. The second to last equality used the fact that X + X = 0 (mentioned above) and the last equality was due the commutative nature of XOR. As we see, no matter the case, your friend will ALWAYS compute K + C revealing the location of the key! This puzzle is indeed very cool, and surprisingly has another computer science angle that motivates not only ideas from coding theory but also cryptography!", "comment_date": "2020-07-06T06:23:28Z", "likes_count": 278}, {"comment_by": "Sam Fielder", "comment_text": "Just flip the coin with the key though...", "comment_date": "2020-07-06T06:20:59Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Bryan Bischof", "comment_text": "Excellent video.

Specifically, if your have an n-dimensional cube, and your colors are 1, 2, ..., n, then from any starting vertex you can always construct a path where the colors of each successive vertex loop through 1, 2, ..., n. This is because every node must be surrounded by all colors, so you can build the path step by step. The path will actually be a loop, since, for example, you can&#39;t have two 1&#39;s that are next to the same 2, so the path cannot enter any  vertex it&#39;s already visited, except for the starting vertex. And eventually it will reach the starting vertex because there&#39;s only finitely many vertices. So by building these loops, we can fill up the entire vertex graph of the cube. And two loops cannot intersect for the same reason of no two 1&#39;s being next to the same 2. And the length of every loop must be some multiple of n, since each loop has to loop through all the colors an integer number of times before it gets back to 1. So that means that the total number or vertices is the sum of a bunch of lengths that are multiples of n. So the number of vertices must itself be a multiple of n. Yet it must also be 2^n. It can then be shown using prime factorization that 2^n is only a multiple of n if n is a power of 2. This shows that there&#39;s only a solution if n is a power of 2.<br><br>Now, another argument I thought of is the following. Every vertex sees 1 red vertex around it. And every red vertex sees 3 vertices. Now, whenever a vertex sees a red vertex, that red vertex sees the other vertex too. This means that the number of times a vertex sees a red vertex is equal to the number of times a red vertex sees a vertex. Let&#39;s call that number E. Then E is 1 times the number of vertices, and 3 times the number of red vertices. That means there must 3 times as many vertices as there are red vertices. So 1/3 of the vertices is red. The same reasoning applies to any other n besides 3.", "comment_date": "2020-07-05T23:52:51Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "stichomythia3435", "comment_text": "Alternative way to phrase &quot;each colour must occur the same number of times&quot;: pick any two colours, say red and blue.

The same would be done for the columns. Then I would have to check by how much the row differs from the goal and would come up with a number of coins that could be flipped (0th row if the number is already correct). From these coins I would then simply chose one which also fixes my column. <br>Edit: There are configurations where it doesn&#39;t work.

I thought about a simplified version of the problem: a 2x2 grid in which tails are 0s and heads are 1s. This means that every initial and final configuration is a binary number. But this doesn&#39;t bring me anywhere. So I start to write tables of what happened if, starting from different setup, I will flip a coin. I obtain 4 different binary numbers with nothing in common. After a trial and error procedure, I see that if I associate a different weight to each position (position 1 has weight 1, position 2 has weight 2 and so on), I obtain always different numbers. In particular, if I take the mod4 of that number (4 is the maximum number of cell present) I always obtain a number between 0 and 3 that is exactly what I&#39;m looking for. But why does this happen? Let&#39;s call a, b, c, d the variables in the first, second, third, and fourth position. Those variables can assume only the 0 or 1 value. The final number obtained in this way is mod4(4*a + 3*b + 2*c + d).

Assign each square on the board a number ranging from 0 to 63 uniquely, for our purposes organised neatly going across then down from 0 to 63. When you see the board, if the coin on a square is heads, add it to a total, if it&#39;s tails, add nothing to the total. Then take the total and calculate the remainder on division by 64. This is a property of the grid, and will be in the range 0-63. Therefore you could target a particular square using this property. Now you need to flip a coin to change this property and make it point to the desired square. Say the property of the grid when you saw it was 3 and the square selected by the robot had been given the value 7. You have two options to change the property: either you add 4, to make it seven, or you subtract 60 (based on the properties of remainders, 3-60 _= -57 + 64 _= 7  (64). Now, hope that either the square with the value 4 is left on tails, in which case you can flip it over, adding four to the total and making it 7, or hope that the square with the value 60 is left on heads, in which case flip it over, subtracting 60 from the total and pointing to 7. <br>When the warden is replaced by a random robot, each of these events is 50% likely, so 75% at least one or both.
