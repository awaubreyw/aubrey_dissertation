To move the tool to position you want smooth movement so that the tool does not break. If your movements jerk is too much then the movement is not smooth but it&#39;s jerky. Another example of jerk is in an amusement park. If you ride the coffe cups the movement of those cups have sudden jerks in them and if you graph the movement function and calculate jerk you find out that jerk is high on those parts of the movement. So the name jerk is a very good description what changing acceleration means.<br><br>Btw. Human&#39;s sensory system work well in acceleration and so smooth acceleration does not cause any feelings in itself. For example your inner ear does not react to gravity. A non changing acceleration field does not register. But increase jerk and you inner ear starts to function. That&#39;s why amussement park rides use high jerk to cause effect in humans.", "comment_date": "2021-04-19T10:07:08Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "A Arjith", "comment_text": "<b>WAIT, Helpp!

It has a positive slope.  So then he says the second derivative of the function would be 0 at x equals 4, or anywhere for that matter.  This is definately wrong(RIGHT???).  The second derivative would just be a nice horizontal line like y  = 2 or y = 3 , whatever the slope of dy/dx is.   Bc the second derivative is the slope of the firsts derivative.  The first derivative is a line with a slope of lets say 3(that&#39;s about how steep his curve looks, whatever).  So the second derivative is undoubatbly y = 3.    I think I see the error. If the yellow line he drew actually was meant to represent f(x)  (which should have been blue according to Grant&#39;s color scheme)  , ONLY THEN will the second derivative be zero. Because if we start with a linear function as f(x), the first derivative will be a flat line, and then since the flat line has a derivative of zero,  only now will the second derivative be zero.     <br><br>The mistake seems a little too obvious for me.

You said \u2018A negative second derivative [of displacement] indicates slowing down\u2019, but that&#39;s only correct <i>if</i> the velocity is positive.  As you noted in the video on derivatives, a negative velocity means that you are headed in the negative direction.  And in that case, a negative acceleration means that you are <i>speeding up,</i> with the velocity becoming even more negative, while a <i>positive</i> acceleration means that you are slowing down.  If you want a quantity that&#39;s positive when you&#39;re speeding up and negative when you&#39;re slowing down, then you need to take the derivative of the <i>speed,</i> that is of the absolute value of the velocity, so the second derivative of the total distance travelled, but <i>not</i> the second derivative of the displacement.  (Arguably, this fits more with the way we use the word \u2018acceleration\u2019 in ordinary language, but the technical meaning is the second derivative of displacement.)<br><br>As an aside, this disparity becomes even more extreme if you&#39;re moving in multiple dimensions of space.  In that case, the displacement, velocity, and acceleration are all vectors, and it doesn&#39;t make sense to say that they are positive or negative as such.  Then the speed is the magnitude of the velocity vector, and the derivative of the speed is again positive if you&#39;re speeding up and negative if you&#39;re slowing down.  But now it&#39;s also possible for the derivative of the speed to be zero, even if the acceleration is nonzero!  In that case, the speed is constant but the velocity is not, because you&#39;re changing direction.", "comment_date": "2019-07-05T03:35:07Z", "likes_count": 159}, {"comment_by": "Manabender", "comment_text": "Don&#39;t forget Snap, Crackle, and Pop!
