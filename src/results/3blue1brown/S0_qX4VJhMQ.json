(area ) or lenght on x axis represented as an area in a square and we are dealing with it now as a square .\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>so as we said ( x + dx ) is the area and its the same as {sqrt(x) + dsqrt(x)}^2 means as f(x) = sqrt of x so here we add f(x) which is square root of x + the small d(f(x)) that has been incremented by dx \r<br>\r<br>so\r<br> \r<br>x + dx = x + [ 2sqrt(x) dsqrt(x) ]+ (dsqrt(x))^2 *********( note here , 2 multiplied by sqrt(x) multiplied by (dsqrt(x)) cuz (dsqrt(x)) is the unit to multipy by to get an area of dx ( and dont confuse here its an area of regular rectangles not a power ) cuz we are looking for the value of dx area\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>so\r<br> \r<br>dx = 2sqrt(x)dsqrt(x) + (dsqrt(x))^2 and we can eliminate the last thing cuz its very small cuz (dsqrt(x)) that small square  = like  0.00000000000000000000000000000001 so we are left with \r<br>\r<br>\r<br>dx = 2sqrt(x)dsqrt(x)\r<br>dx/dsqrt(x) = 2sqrt(x)\r<br>so we flip here the nominator and denominator to get the reciprocal \r<br>dsqrt(x)/dx = 1/2sqrt(x) \r<br>\r<br>thats it guys go check with your calculator now ;) have a nice day and you grant stop leaving people confused please \u0645

Usually when we write area we say it has units of squared meters or squared feet which tells us our area function is proportional to x^2. Here this is not the case, our area is one dimensional. So if we were describing area in this example it would have units of meters or feet telling us now our area function is proportional to x. If our area is proportional to x^2 then our side lengths our x, but if our area is proportional to x then our side lengths are sqrt(x). Using all of this we now know that any infinitesimal change in our side length must be in steps of d(sqrt(x)) for this example NOT the typical size of dx.<br><br>Once you use d(sqrt(x)) as your change in side length the problems works out nicely!<br>You have 2 new small rectangles to add each with area<br>sqrt(x)d(sqrt(x))<br>Therefore the total change in area (or dx) is now <br>2*sqrt(x)d(sqrt(x)) = dx<br>Rewriting this gives us<br>d(sqrt(x))/dx = 1/2 x^(-1/2)<br><br>Hope this helps!", "comment_date": "2019-02-25T03:56:37Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Darius Darkshadow", "comment_text": "<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0_qX4VJhMQ&amp;t=15m58s\">15:58</a> How do you know the angles are the same?

I understand how to get the derivative. I framed it as: A + G + R = A ( A being the Area of the Rectangle, G being the Green area, R being the Red area. Meaning that since the Area of the rectangle A should stay equal to 1, adding those 2 other areas wouldn&#39;t change its area and we would still be left with A. Simplifying by A this becomes G + R = 0 (which makes sense because in order for A to stay constant adding them together should cancel them out).<br><br>G + R = 0 becomes dx/x + xd(1/x) = 0 and thus the derivative is d(1/x)/dx = -1/x^2.<br><br>I understand this rationale. What bugs me is, the Green sliver is ADDED to the rectangle, while the red one is SUBSTRACTED, then why would it be G <b>+</b> R = 0 instead of G <b>-</b> R = 0 ? I think the latter would be more appropriate since the rectangle gets REDUCED by the area of the red sliver R. So doesn&#39;t it make more sense to have G - R instead of G + R? (Ev<br><br>The only thing I could think of where we should put G + R instead of minus, is if we put G + R = 0 then G = - R (which respects my intuition that R should be negative because it gets reduced from the rectangle, while G - R = 0 implies G = R meaning they&#39;re both positive which goes against that intuition) and then maybe we reverse-engineer the process to compute that it&#39;s A + G + R = A instead of minus R?

I don&#39;t know if I&#39;m able to explain it on a simple written comment but I&#39;ll try. <br><br>First of all, let&#39;s only look at the big triangle.

I&#39;ll also call the big triangle BT and the small triangle ST.<br><br>The radius of the circle is always perpendicular to the tangent at that point where the radius touch. Therefore, from the radius to the tangent, there&#39;s always 90\u00b0. That&#39;s pretty obvious, I know. But it wasn&#39;t obvious to me why that was important.<br><br>The angle from the BT&#39;s hypotenuse (or circle radius) to the bottom part of the ST must be \u03b8. I hope you can see why because it&#39;s hard to explain... One of many ways to see it is to notice that the angle between the bottom part of the ST and the right side of the BT is 90\u00b0. 90\u00b0-\u03c6=\u03b8.<br><br>Because the ST&#39;s hypotenuse is colinear with the tangent, we know that the angle between the ST&#39;s hypotenuse and the BT&#39;s hypotenuse (also the circle&#39;s radius) is 90\u00b0, as told in the first step. <br><br>Now we can find out one of the unknown angles on the ST. \u03b8+(Unknown Angle)=90\u00b0. So (Unknown Angle)=\u03c6. If the ST has \u03c6 and 90\u00b0, it must also have \u03b8. (\u03b8+90\u00b0+\u03c6=180\u00b0) If both triangles have the same angles, they&#39;re actually proportional.<br><br>This was probably extremely confusing. lol Also, my english is kind of rusty, so sorry about that.

Since it&#39;s not coming to me easily I&#39;m trying to work it out myself, just like you asked, but by the amount of time I&#39;ve spent, I would have been working on this for several class periods.

This isn&#39;t at all the case because the rectangle on screen isn&#39;t the output of f(x^-1) like squares and cubes are of f(x^2) and f(x^3). The equations I constructed below are pure nonsense as a result. It took me literally hours and the help of several other people for me to finally understand this.<br><br>Call me an idiot if you like. But I&#39;m certainly not the only idiot trying to learn calculus. I think 3B1B&#39;s presentation is actually rather confusing at <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0_qX4VJhMQ&amp;t=12m00s\">12:00</a>.

As for the one where the power IS 1, that power vanishes when we divide by dx (again, as stated by the derivative formula) - so in the end we&#39;re left with something that has no &quot;tiny&quot; stuff in it (eg. no dx). And this &quot;something&quot; follows the dx(x^n) = nx^(n-1) formula. So, my question is, is there some practical use for the other terms that we let vanish? I know that first we would have to get rid of the dx terms in them, perhaps by performing the derivative operation multiple times. But assuming we do, would that be useful for anything?

I call this out and explain further in many of the videos, especially chapter 7 on limits, but given that students are often told not to take these terms too seriously, to be wary of treating them as literal variables, it\u2019s probably worth adding another comment on the matter.<br><br>The path between treating these terms as literal nudges and a fully rigorous treatment of calculus is actually quite short, considering the loose language that seems to be involved.  You just need to understand two things that are implicit in the notation \u201cdf\u201d and \u201cdx\u201d.<br><br><br>First, the size of the nudge df is dependent on the size of dx.  It is not its own free variable, and what it means depends on your current context.<br><br>Second, for any equation written in terms of df and dx, when you replace dx with an actual number (e.g. 0.01), and replace df by whatever nudge to the output is caused by that choice of dx, the equation will probably be slightly wrong, with some error between the left-hand side and right-hand side.  But what it means to be using these differential terms is that that error will approach 0 as your choice for dx approach 0.  This is why terms which are initially proportional to (dx)^2, and hence retain a differential term even after dividing by dx, can be safely ignored.<br><br>Even in the most rigorous proofs of derivative rules and properties, these tiny nudges show up, though often under the names &quot;delta-x&quot; or &quot;h&quot;.  The ideas presented here are essentially the hearts of those proofs but phrased without the surrounding formal language.  I put together this series not just with calculus students in mind, but also with the hopes of pointing back to chapters here when I cover real analysis, the formal backbone of calculus, so I am motivated as much by an ultimate desire for people to understand the rigor as anyone else.<br><br>(Also, as a hint to those asking about how you know that the triangles at the end are similar, use the fact that the tangent line of a circle is perpendicular to its radius.)", "comment_date": "2017-04-30T15:33:33Z", "likes_count": 289}, {"comment_by": "Arya Aleph", "comment_text": "I always enjoy 3blue1brown&#39;s work, and I love the daily videos.
