In general, if we just look at things algebraically instead of defining a specific function to satisfy the question (where we interpret a^b = exp(ln(a)*b), where ln is the principle branch of the complex logarithm), we get a^b = e^(ln(a) * b), where ln(a) is all possible solutions to the equation e^x = a.  Here is the issue - if we interpret e^x to mean exp(x), then ln(a) + 2ipiZ would provide all solutions to that equation, where again ln is the principle branch of the complex algorithm. However, does this still cover all the solutions if we instead define as e^x as  exp^((ln(a) + 2ipiZ) * b) instead, or have additional solutions managed to creep in? I think it&#39;s closed based on the proof that there are only so many possible exponential functions, but I don&#39;t seen it just from looking at the formula, maybe it be proven algebraically if a bit more work is done to it. <br><br>Anyway, if you define exponentiation so the output is the set of all possible solutions, and extend it to sets as the union of the output for all elements in that input set (which would be easy enough to do if exp^((ln(a) + 2ipiZ) * b) covers all possible solutions, regardless of how e^x is interpretted), then you get much different behavior for tetration. Instead of being a matter of choosing an initial interpretation, it would be the set of all branches - which would exceed the set of all solutions from all initial interpretation as branches would emerge from starting at one interpretation, but then switching to another.

At first I thought you were going off the deep end... but now I clearly understand the different interpretations of e... both the functional operation one for real values and the extended non-functional, multi-valued operation...that manages both imaginary and real numbers ...... with multiple outputs... the demo of the extended exp operation and the switch around that occurs when you flip the real and imaginary parts is amazing! Mind expanding! Thank you so much! And thanks for going deep into the logical implications of f(a+b)=f(ab)... tetration chaos is amazing too! I believe that lamberts function W() ..can solve certain infinite tetration puzzles?! ... but in the back of my mind now I\u2019m thinking all functions that I\u2019ve been taught have to be reinterpreted in a new context... mind blowing!", "comment_date": "2021-03-09T16:56:51Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Clumpy", "comment_text": "this guy is the biggest fucking nerd ive ever seen in my entire goddamn life", "comment_date": "2021-02-23T13:54:03Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "omer dassa", "comment_text": "you kind of copernicued my notion of exponents", "comment_date": "2021-02-14T23:16:46Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Colin Bache", "comment_text": "Really love your videos.

What is b^x if b is negative? I.e., f(x) = (-2)^x? it&#39;s pretty easy for integer values, but as soon as you try rational values you can get different answers. For example (-2)^(3/2) can give you 2(root 2) i or  -2(root 2) i depending on if you cube it first or take the root first, so I&#39;ve given up on trying to understand it. But now all you have to is define it as exp(rx) where r = ln2 + pi*I, and you&#39;ll get a unique function, or choose a different value of r, say ln2 - pi*(i) and get a different function. Both functions  spiral around the complex plane but in different directions. But now it at least makes sense to talk about exponential functions with a negative base.", "comment_date": "2020-05-15T20:51:30Z", "likes_count": 5}, {"comment_by": "Gayatri Savarkar", "comment_text": "This lecture was way outside the usual highschool syllabus, but it was definitely interesting!
