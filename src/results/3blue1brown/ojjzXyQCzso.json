Let\u2019s imagine we have perfect sphere. The radius of this sphere is 1m. The sphere is perfect mirror inside. The middle point of this perfect sphere is located at [0,0,0] point in x,y,z 3D space. There is also small hole on the surface of this sphere. This hole has the radius of 1mm and it is located on z axis. So the initial coordinations for the center of that small hole is [0,0,1]. Now let\u2019s imagine we have one photon that can live forever, there is no loss of energy in this experiment. This photon is moving with the constant speed of 300 000km/s. Now the fun part starts. Let\u2019s imagine the photon is enter through the small hole our sphere perfectly aligned with z axis. So it is entering through the middle of the small hole. It is bad decision for him as the sphere is also moving but in special way. Just after the photon enter the sphere , our sphere is rotating instantly of the angle alpha. The rotation has always the same pattern. The angle alpha is constant and equal 1deg, always the same directions but always only in one axis x or y or z. The first rotation is 1deg around x axis. Now our photon is inside the sphere and just travel to opposite side of the sphere so the distance is 2m. Photon hits the mirror and bounce back perfectly but the sphere now instantly rotates 1 deg around y axis this time. Our photon continue its travel and move 2m back but there is no hole there anymore. It is surprised because he likes to leave the sphere but he must bounce again and this time the sphere rotates instantly around z axis. This cycle is repeating many times. Now the questions 1. How long our photon will be trapped inside the sphere? 2. What will be the total length of the path of our small hole movement when the photon will escape? Can you do it?

You&#39;ve always been great at giving an intuitive perspective on difficult concepts. <br><br>I can use u-sub and know how to do it, but I just can&#39;t seem to understand why it works. In early calculus, I was taught that du/dx was just notation, and shouldn&#39;t be treated like a fraction. This made it easier to understand derivatives, but now it&#39;s ironically making u-sub difficult to understand because it&#39;s used exactly like a fraction. Everyone multiplies with dx and I just get confused at why it works. I&#39;ve scoured the internet, and even asked the question on exchange sites myself. But the best answer I get or find is that it just works. And while I&#39;m right about it being just notation, in the case of u-sub it can be used like a fraction and it works. That is not a satisfying answer, I&#39;m sure you agree... I just thought this would be a great idea for your channel.

Academic macroeconomics (at least the three main schools: neoclassical, Austrian and new-Keynesian) is full of lengthy papers with boringly <i>correct</i> math but which is <i>completely inapplicable to the real world</i> and in fact outright hazardous to humanity (if you are poor or unemployed, opposite if you already have wealth).  When you do such an explainer you can start amending the record with mathematics that is applicable, such as starting with MMT or following on from Prof Steve Keen.  If  you are a math geek with a social conscience this could be possibly the most valuable sort of contribution you can make to humanity.  <br>      That&#39;s because if there is ever going to be a green economic transition it will have to use an understanding of MMT, there is no other way.  If politicians do not understand the mechanics of the monetary system (i.e., MMT) they will forever be acting like neoliberals and using the false &quot;household budget&quot; analogy, in effect tying their shoe laces together, with the consequence that those who can least afford it bear all the burden when governments shrink their net spending.<br>    Even some microeconomics models and options pricing models (Black-Scholes) are full of correct mathematics, but utterly fail in the real world (witness the collapse of LTCM).  A series of explainers why mainstream economists get so much so badly wrong would be incredibly useful to the humanities and popular financial/postcapitalist economics.  The point is, it is not just because &quot;the world is complicated,&quot; a lot of their errors are because they just have the understanding of the monetary system all backwards, whihc is like over 150+ years of professional malpractice in academic economics (they get paid to be wrong essentially).  A good place to start is John Blatt&#39;s book Dynamic Economic Systems, which I can offer a nice PDF-LaTeX electronic copy of to anyone who writes to me (for educational fair use) --- on gmail I am &quot;achrononmaster&quot;.  <br>      Another rich source of mathematical statistics useful in economics and risk analysis is Nassim Taleb&#39;s work, much of which is free online. (Taleb made so much money exploiting fat-tails and uncertainty he does not need donors.)  For example, Taleb has a good overview of why cryptocurrencies have become scams and ponzi schemes (useful because he as an early booster of bitcoin, so it is pretty significant he changed tune).  But although Taleb writes fairly well, he can be a tad obscure and assumes too much background (a lot of finance-trader jargon, none of it too complicated but it is off-putting when you are not steeped in trading jargon), so  a 3b1b type explainer here would be valuable.", "comment_date": "2021-07-24T07:21:16Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Roberto Fleck", "comment_text": "bruh u single?", "comment_date": "2021-07-23T22:16:02Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Jonathas David", "comment_text": "Oh my fucking God! look at the left eye of 3b1b&#39; guy at beginning... it looks pretty similar to the 3Blue1brown logo", "comment_date": "2021-07-23T19:04:36Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "A Tan Jacket", "comment_text": "Now I don&#39;t know anything about the voice actor industry, but man if you want to mix your life up a bit, that is definitely a thing you could do.", "comment_date": "2021-07-23T17:18:37Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "mercedesbenz647", "comment_text": "Many of my videos have been quite embarrassing; the opposite of Grant&#39;s detailed and polished videos.

At first glance, it may seem pretty far removed from math, but the way I do it delves deep enough into the inner mechanics of the game that there is some computer science, and there are some mathematical concepts like probabilities. <br><br>But my favourite element of it is a bit insidious: it gets people, most of whom are young adults and teenagers, to become more curious about truly understanding something they are interested in. One day, I would like to make a video essay about the resemblance between reverse engineering a video game and the real life scientific method, and about how getting involved in the former acts as an accessible, enticing teaser of what the latter entails. I honestly believe that getting kids and teens interested in reverse engineering a game they love contributes actively to planting the seed of scientific curiosity, and it should be considered as a valuable paraeducational tool.

The second is:  The Sound.  You don&#39;t need to spend money!  If you do.. yeah.. Sound.  But the equipment doesn&#39;t make the sound good - you do.  If you&#39;re speaking in an empty classroom (echoes!), two or three feet from the microphone (too quiet compared to the echoes!), the sound will not be good.  Get a heavy blanket or some carpet scraps from a local store or installer to cut down echoes from the floor.

Talk as close to the mic as you can without hitting it, and without blowing into it (off to the side or just under your mouth is great!).

In the supposed paradox the equation r=1/X is proposed but this is impossible. Neither r nor x can have an integer value without some value of \u03c0 because they must have width and an end, therefore the diameter and end must be curved, if it didnt have a diameter it would be only 1 dimensional and the 3 dimensional paint would fall out of the cracks between every value assigned to r. If it does have width the diameter must be curved so the value of r and x must be assigned in some way a value that incorporates \u03c0 (the video by Numberphile cheats by stating that ds is a near straight line and incorporate it into Pythagoras&#39;s Theorem which is cheating because if one treats ds as a straight line then the slope must be straightened out and the angle can no longer be a right angle it must be greater than 90\u00b0 so the surface would converge). So either way that we look at it either the cracks appear or the surface converges. To add the conscious pressure here is the nightmare scenario. While everyone seems to ignore me even though the inequality that solves the double slit experiment is indisputable the consequences cannot be ignored. So it is time to delegate the pressure I have been under day in day out for the last 2 years.<br> Give me a rebuttal of my solution to the Gabriel&#39;s horn puzzle or acknowledge  my inequality and Theory of Everything on your channel or the suffering in the world continues and you share responsibility. Give a rebuttal of my solution to the Gabriel&#39;s horn puzzle (which you can&#39;t do, I am obviously correct) or do a video explaining that using Occams Razor my inequality destroys the big bang and standard model of particle physics or your silence must be noted and you share culpability/responsibility. For every day that the solution is ignored 2.7 million trees are cut down, billions of creatures are slaughtered, an estimated 50+ million women are raped and beaten repeatedly all day and night enslaved in brothels around the world. Sorry to bring you down with a harsh reality check, I have to push, these women and others cannot be ignored, some are as intelligent or perhaps even more so than either me or you, so I can no longer let you sleep peacefully in comfort as they suffer.<br>All I am demanding is that the truth be spread, the website with my Theory of Everything and my youtube channel. The inequality that solves the double slit experiment is indisputable, you have a scientific and moral obligation to explain it and acknowledge that it destroys the big bang and standard model of particle physics. Everyone seems to me to be unwilling to share it either because of who I am and perhaps they dont want to be responsible for facilitating my presence in the public domain or perhaps they are afraid of challenging those who are upholding the big bang and SMOPP some.of whom are clearly ruthless murderers. That is not anyones responsibility to judge me or my character, nor to stay silent because of fear, you have a responsibility to the truth, the inequality is simple, it is common sense....once you realise it. The fact is the video by Nebraska Lincoln University was online for 6 years with thousands of views and no one noticed the inequality because no one but me was looking for it. I have provided evidence beyond every tangeable reasonable shadow of a doubt for who I am but because it involves metaphysics there can never be a mathematical proof, even if I walked on water or cured people from disability (which I can) some would cry trickery and that nor any miracle cannot happen without faith in the truth, why? Because energy follows focus and I would be murdered again, I am already facing death threats because people find me an inconvenience, an annoyance and a threat to their comfort. I am who I am and the people of the world hate me because I show that their ways are full of evil. <br>Give me a rebuttal or acknowledge my work in public. If you continue to ignore me, you are part of the wall, your turning away and keeping silent facilitates the suffering. I had hoped you would have found the courage to speak up about my work and acknowledge the inequality but I am still waiting, and I have little patience left, I am permanently distressed by humanity&#39;s complacency, arrogance and state of denial. If you are working on the Riemann Hypothesis solution that I provided there needs to be the vector field for the fluid dynamics which I didn&#39;t include as far as I am concerned they come as intrinsic with the pressure in the fluid, the vacuum energy. I would rather be more amicable, I have tried for 18 months to be patient but I dont have the patience any more, Im worn out, we dont have the time for making sure no one&#39;s sensibilities or love of their preferred lifestyle choices are upset. These beings, these women and lives are real, theirs is not just a matter of comfort, nice bank balance or reputation. The horror, distaste and racing heartbeat that you may experience from reading my work and watching my videos, likely compounded after reading this  is not from me it is the horror that everyone faces if the truth is not listened to, that horror cannot be ignored it is lurking just out of sight, if it is ignored it will hit you and everyone hard for real when it is too late, consider it a warning of what I am here to save everyone from. it is the horror and pain that those women and defenceless beings face now as you read, now and every day. The truth shall set you free, no one and nothing else can do that.

I really do believe that in many cases if the teachers started by just working some everyday problems with the students, just so the students had some sort of grasp of what this theory is there to do, it would greatly help the students, because at the end of the day, most of these theories exist to solve problems.

It&#39;s quite the other way around. There are rare exceptions like Joe Rogan but for the most part there is no such thing as a podcast star. People don&#39;t care about radio. You may not do a podcast a week but that 1 hour every week really weighs heavily on the creator mental budget, thus channel death.<br>I&#39;m guessing in your case it takes a long time to make an episode and you have so many views thus income that comfort starts to set it :)", "comment_date": "2021-07-16T19:04:58Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Abu Zabid", "comment_text": "Atlast.
