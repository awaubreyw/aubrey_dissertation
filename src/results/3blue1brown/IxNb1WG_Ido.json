All maths is arbitrary. It&#39;s literally axiomatic. In philosophy this division between the real world and logical progressions based on our invention is called the analytic-synthetic distinction.

Look at computer coding, it solves the same problems but uses an entirely different framework. These things are cross translatable not because there&#39;s some <i>essence of maths</i> in the universe but because of the law of non-contradiction and the law of the excluded middle.

Like think of it. We normally draw single variable graphs on two axes, the x axis for a input and the y axis for the output. But that&#39;s not compulsory at all. Its just convenient that&#39;s all. When we move from one variables to two variables, we add another axis, the z axis, to represent and plot our output. But here&#39;s the twist. When we work with complex numbers where both our input and output need two axes each, to represent the real and imaginary parts, we move away from the ideal of adding another axis to represent another variable and instead use two axes to represent the two input variables and one axis and &quot;colour shading&quot; to represent the output variables. See how all of a sudden our attachment towards axes changed. It actually took me a embarrassingly long time to actually grasp this and as a result I could never understand the meaning of a matrix transformation. For me the input and outputs should be located on different, independent axes. <br>Call it a mathematical mental bias of sorts :)", "comment_date": "2021-04-20T23:33:53Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Chris B", "comment_text": "Ok, so what you&#39;re saying is I <b>should</b> get a tattoo of Phi because flesh..core of nature..something.

Now the names tangent, cotangent, secant, and cosecant all make a ton more sense to me, while the name sine makes less sense. According to Wikipedia, &quot;sine&quot; derives from the Sanskrit word for chord, but sine is definitely not represented (at least commonly) as a chord of the unit circle.<br><br>Furthermore, it was pure etymological accident that the Sanskrit word for sine was translated \u2014 through Arabic \u2014 into the Latin word for bosom, and is the same word as &quot;breast&quot; in Spanish. I thought for sure that was a description of the smooth curves that y=sin(x) makes when graphed with Cartesian coordinates, but I guess all these trig functions were named long before they were ever graphed that way.", "comment_date": "2018-10-01T17:09:51Z", "likes_count": 3}, {"comment_by": "zZE94", "comment_text": "Beautiful.

Pi is cliche to the point of repulsion for me tbh. A geometrical figure would be good but it might not look very aesthetic; apparently Gauss was so pleased about proving that heptagons aren&#39;t constructible shapes but 17-gons are, that he wanted his gravestone inscribed with a 17-gon. But then his stonemason said it would just come out looking like a circle anyway.
