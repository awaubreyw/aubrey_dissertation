The n by n identity matrix is a representation of the basis vectors in n-dimensional space that have had no transformation applied to them, and as a result are their own inverse.

With the positive naturals 1, 2, 3, 4, 5..., you can give it a unique name in the naturals (for EVERY natural) by just subtracting 1 (f n = n-1); 1 becomes 0, 2 becomes 1, 3 becomes 2, etc. So, clearly, there are just as many positive naturals as naturals. There are just as many positive EVEN numbers as there are positive integers in total, and you can show this with f n = 2*n; 2 becomes 1, 4 becomes 2, 6 becomes 3, 8 becomes 4, etc.<br><br>There are even just as many integers as naturals; f n = 2*n-1 if n &gt;= 0 else 2*abs(n); so 0 &lt;- 0, 1 &lt;- 1, 2 &lt;- <del>1, 3 &lt;</del> 2, 4 &lt;- -2, etc.<br><br>Now, this is all well and good, but we can EVEN prove that there are just as many rationals as there are naturals. \u00bfHow, you ask? \u00a1Why, quite simply, actually! We treat a rational number as a fraction n/d, where n is any integer and d is any positive natural. We arrange these into a grid (this is fairly visual, so you&#39;ll have to draw it if you don&#39;t get it), going to the right as we count n up (using the way of counting integers we gave above) and down as we count d up (just ascending from 1 to infinity). <br><br>Now, this grid is infinitely large, of course, so you can&#39;t just read left-to-right top-to-bottom or top-to-bottom left-to-right (and you REALLY can&#39;t go right-to-left and/or bottom-to-top, because you have to START at infinity). \u00bfSo how do we count, then? \u00a1Diagonally! Draw diagonal lines going down to the left through the grid, so that every number in column c and row r has c+r the same as every other number on its line. Now, we can simply count in a way that will give EVERY rational a name (in fact, infinitely many with arbitrarily many names) by just going along the diagonals (so looking across the diagonals by where they start at the top, follow them down until you find your number). \u00a1Success!<br><br>Now, the proof for #(\u211d\u00d7\u211d) = <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23%E2%84%9D\">#\u211d</a> is a bit more complicated, by which I mean I don&#39;t know it at all, but I do know it exists. Look it up.<br><br>So, therefor, there exists a function mapping vectors in 1-space (from 0 to \u211d, so we can just represent it as \u211d) to vectors in 2-space (from 0 to (\u211d, \u211d), so we can just represent it as \u211d\u00d7\u211d).

Because this is not explained (I personally wouldn&#39;t known how to explain it intuitively) some of your statements are also not obvious, e.g. Why if A is surjective (which as you explained is the case when det(A) /= 0) should A be injective? If you define A^-1 to be a map satisfying A^-1 A = I, why should this map be unique? And why should it be linear if it exists?
