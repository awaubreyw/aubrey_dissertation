For Ukrainians, Russians - and for the media (+ please translate into all languages!). I, a citizen of Russia, want to appeal to Ukrainians, victims of monstrous aggression: know that not only obscurantists who want to destroy all living things live in Russia, but also worthy, brave people who resist the catastrophe under threat of death. Now it is more dangerous for such people in Russia than in Ukraine. Also, many Russians who resist insane politics are scattered around the world for one reason or another - and now they are humiliated and attacked by others, not realizing that they are friends, absolutely noble and sane people - and they are also victims of the insanity of a bunch of obscurantists and slaves deceived by them. It is important: today, not the moral, but the technical side of the problem has reached a new, unprecedented level - therefore, we must all be united in our desire to stop the collapse of the world that we all knew, to save the lives of billions of people. You must understand that today the world is divided not only into nations, but also into reason and anti-reason, decency - and scum, which has no nation. You and I, in all parts of the world, must stop the madness that is happening. I ask you all to share this message, I ask all the media to publish it so that the quantity grows into the quality of the event: the puppeteer and other puppeteers should hear. Whether you like me or not, there&#39;s no time for that now: if we don&#39;t stop the catastrophe, everyone will die, just look at your families, at your homes - nothing will happen!! There is a way out, but after a few hours - there is no way out! What I can do now, no one will be able to do soon. We have to stop the war, stop the hatred, stop the puppeteers and the puppeteer.

Its quite interesting how the system can self-adjust to make sure that mining\\validating is always profitable, and therefore even if there is a big crash in mining profitability it should just result in a slowdown of transactions until the system balances. I guess the issue is that there is a big problem if the coin is used for real large scale commerce\\business that rely on guaranteed volume. If a large enough proportion of bitcoin transactions were for real vital goods and services, then a crash in mining profitability could drive he value to zero since the value would be much more tied to the amount of volume the system can handle. Lack of trust could continually inflate it, which would then continually make it harder to restore validation capacity.

This will grow much faster than Alice&#39;s fake one and so will become the dominant one throughout the network of nodes.

What is the common strategy for that case? Does the miner cancels the calculation of the POW to include the new transactions in the block and start the POW over again? Or enqueue the new transactions for a newer block? What is the stretegy to consider a block ready before calculating the POW?<br><br>Also, when is a transaction considered &quot;complete&quot;? I mean, creating the POW takes about 10 mins(ish) for a single block. So from the moment I run a transaction, (i.e  &quot;Bob gets 1BTC&quot; ) to the moment it actually gets included in a block and broadcasted to the other miners, it takes a minimum of 10 mins ( ish ) due to the effort of calculating the POW. The transaction is not part of the blockchain until then right?.  Also.. I need to TRUST the miner to &quot;take care of my transaction&quot; until it actually gets broadcasted to the rest of the nodes. Right?<br><br>What if Miner &#39;A&#39;, has a block and is calculating its POW. But before it can get the POW ready, another miner wins the race for the &quot;next&quot; block in the chain, say miner &#39;B&#39; broadcast a valid block with a whole different set of transactions, then what?

I&#39;d say it&#39;s outrightly wrong to just sit back hodl and wait maybe incur some losses along the line, that&#39;s a wrong mindset for an investor because as an investor finding ways to always increase and stack up more coins thereby making prof!ts should be the way of life That being said, the market is still all about BTC at the moment and I&#39;ll advise current investors and newbies to take advantage of Clara Austin program, a pro trader who runs a training program for investors/newbies who lack understanding on how trading Bitcoin works, to help them recover loss from the crash and also accumulate more bitcoin, with her program i went from having 1.3btc to 9.8btc in just 5 weeks.

Then perhaps they buy ledger units in advance -- with existent currency --  to assure others they have available funds committed to settle up (?).<br><br>Then it all melts down. I don&#39;t see how the ledger units have any intrinsic  value beyond the existent currency used to pay for them or to settle up.<br><br>A currency should ideally be designed to maintain its unit value -- as a unit of account -- and to not inflate or deflate. This crypto currency has no such intention.

Is this being understood and acknowledged with crypto?<br><br>Our current money system is an ideal money system -- underneath the fraud that lays on top of it.  <br><br>Commercial banks don&#39;t loan depositors money.  When a dentist takes out a mortgage he is really just issued his own coupon for dental services.  He has to honor these coupons on a strict schedule -- so many per month.  So it&#39;s super simple and easy to see why those coupons -- now called dollars -- have intrinsic value. <br><br>People are totally ignorant of this and derisively call such money fiat -- ie just paper.   There is fraud -- but not in the underlying system.  We just need to remove the fraud.<br><br>The crux of the fraud is in this:  when the dentist receives a house for his coupons from the public -- then honors his coupons, providing dental services to the public -- then who provides the loan?  Now:  who collects the interest?<br><br>The inflation and deflation in our current system is a product of the scam -- not of the true and logical money system operating underneath the scam.<br><br>This is a really easy to understand scam with a beautiful true &#39;simple and clear&#39; money system operating underneath it -- and an easy situation to fix.

The downward pressure was marked by the Parabolic SAR as its markers were found above the price bars. Meanwhile, the Directional Movement Index confirmed the southbound pressure evident in the market. As the -DI further diverged from the +DI, it was a sign of rising selling pressure in the S&#39;N&#39;X market. As the price failed to hold on to any support points, it may be moving towards the support at $4.15. However, S&#39;N&#39;X has not seen this value since January 2021.

Because at some point the growing production, value, or GDP, whatever you want to call it... won&#39;t that global growth rate surpass the growth rate of new BTC &#39;lotto tickets&#39; rolling out? <br>Or will Bitcoin tend to follow some other kind of standard.... another fiat currency, gold, anything? (That is, opposed to BTC itself being the standard for other currencies or other cryptos). <br>I guess deflation all depends on supply and demand...<br>I could definitely see a large supply drop-off in 10 years. People &#39;hoarding,&#39; &#39;hedging,&#39; even banks buying up supply and decreasing the float. It&#39;s interesting to see where this might go.<br><br>But the main question that I can&#39;t get over is:<br>Is crypto an asset, or a currency?<br><br>Because if it&#39;s a currency, what does it matter if I don&#39;t get on board early. As long the U.S. dollar doesn&#39;t collapse, or hyperinflate, it won&#39;t be like I&#39;m missing out on anything, right? It would eventually stabilize. <br><br>But if it&#39;s an asset....<br>I can&#39;t really justify calling it an &#39;asset&#39;. I mean it will always have that symbolic value of &#39;being the first crypto name everybody heard of,&#39; but...<br>Crypto isn&#39;t creating value. It isn&#39;t providing goods or services to people in any way. (Or maybe it is... let me know how if that&#39;s the case, I don&#39;t want to argue, but just to learn. I guess the closest analogy it could draw to an asset would be real estate. But again, idk.)<br>And then the argument with that becomes... well even if it is an asset, I could invest in real estate as an asset instead, or land, commodities, art, classic cars... I mean I&#39;d trust the value of those things in 10 years down the road before I trust crypto. <br>And you can get your hand in the cookie jar too by investing in companies like GOOG, AMZN, SQ all while getting exposure but at the same time too kind of off-loading the risk. (If you want to call it &#39;risk.&#39; Maybe &#39;uncertainty&#39; is better.)<br><br>So I guess the main point it... if it&#39;s a currency, I&#39;ll be fine as long the dollar doesn&#39;t go crazy, or I have assets that protect against the dollar going crazy... and on the other side, I&#39;m much more secure investing in things I know 100% to actually be assets and having physical value as opposed to virtual value. <br><br>So.

To better understand what I mean, imagine there was a cryptocurrency based on the randomness of the smoke-particles after burning oil. In this case, we would start feverly burn all the oil we could get to just generate a currency. If I were alien and discovered Earth suddenly, I would certainly think hunams are not too clever to bother getting in contact with them. Cryptocurrency is good, but it&#39;s still a currecny which has only virtual value, like any money. So, why spend so much resources on just generating this currency. There must be other ways for it. Or, if we still take the proof-of-work concept, the work must not be just &quot;burn more resources than others&quot;.<br><br>People just need to turn on their imagination. There are lots of examples of usefull work that could be done. If we still take compuations: there are a lot of scientific projects for distibuted computations where everybody can participate.

Etc etc. Just some thought-efforts need to be done.<br><br>The example with oil above was not random, though still pretty demonstrative, I believe.

The bullish breakout that took DOT all the way up to $43 in mid-February seemed to be taking shape again in the form of another solid ascending triangle, at press time. In fact, the altcoin\u2019s price has already tested the upper resistance line of the pattern thrice since the end of February.

But what if by chance 50 different miners, find their block at around the same time, so the block chain forks 50times. Now if I have over 50% of the computational power in the protocol I could pick which miner I like most and elongate the path where he forked the blockchain faster than any other path could elongate, eventually rewarding his work, but if nobody has that power, I assume miners have to organize, saying they all submit their blocks to the same website and whoever comes first gets rewarded and since that isn&#39;t very attractive, they probably share democratically if one miner happens to win the lottery. So they all invest their computational power into the same chain and reward each other. Like playing lottery with a group of people?

PKI or Public Key Infrastructure, is a system that generates both a Private and Public set of keys, that are both born on the server (or lets say the receiving end), of the initial communication handshake, and is ONLY used to secure the communications channel at first then discarded.  A Private key can only decrypt and a Public key and only ever encrypt.  Public Keys and Private keys, go together ( and are generated together) to perform the encrypted or secret transport of another 3rd Key, called the secret key, that is totally born on the client end, (lets say the initiating end), across a now  secure communication channel, made possible by the PKI.  A secret key, is a totally separate key only used for the final encryption and decryption of the data or message, that is passed via the PKI, which is purely for the purpose of encryption and decryption of the actual data or message you wish to send.  It is amazing how many people even in the very technical IT world totally misunderstand this concept and in fact there are many Youtube videos that incorrectly state this, and I just want to make sure people understand how important this is, because this is at the heart of us feeling secure when we pass transaction back and forth. It is commonly thought the the PKI is doing the encrypting and decrypting of the data across the channel when it is not. This is only ever done by the Secret Key and the only point of the PkI pair is to get that secret key across the channel securely.  Hope this helps everyone&#39;s understanding more on this very murky subject.", "comment_date": "2021-03-14T02:53:34Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Guapscotch", "comment_text": "thanks for this, helps me understand the block chain a bit more", "comment_date": "2021-03-14T02:33:11Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Colin Pumpernickel", "comment_text": "WTF?", "comment_date": "2021-03-13T23:02:56Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "JamesPeter", "comment_text": "Sometimes I feel like I want to like a video more than once.

I&#39;m a computer science student and I can tell that if you aren&#39;t one, you&#39;re probably gonna have some trouble in understanding some basic parts of this video (no fault of the creator tho, this video&#39;s awesome!). A few pointers for you guys: A function here (i.e. a function in code) does essentially the same thing as a function in math. It takes some input (given in brackets) and works on it to give an output. Different functions have different types of outputs. So some functions return only True or False, while others return numbers/words, etc. Secondly, in case anyone here thinks that you could just use a very powerful machine to guess the secret key through brute force, just know that you can&#39;t. I mean, you can but it would take decades(if not more) for even the most powerful machines in the world to correctly guess the entire thing (If you&#39;re interested in this, I would recommend for you to check out Dan Brown&#39;s &quot;Digital Fortress&quot; just to obtain some idea about this approach). Also, this is pretty basic but just in case someone is wondering, everything here is given in 0&#39;s and 1&#39;s because those are the two digits that form every piece of data in a computer&#39;s memory. These are called bits (as in bits of data). Every single number, every alphabet in a computer&#39;s memory is formed using these digits (much like every building made using Lego is a product of a bunch of Lego blocks). Hell, even different colors have separate unique codes using 0 &amp; 1 (primarily why the sRGB palette exists, because every color can be made using Red, Green &amp; Blue (RGB), and so every color&#39;s code is formed through combinations of Red, Green &amp; Blue&#39;s codes). If anyone has more questions,  I&#39;ll try my best to answer them. After all, I&#39;m still a student so I don&#39;t know all that much. <br><br>P.S.- In case someone thinks I&#39;m trying to act smart or something, I&#39;m not. I&#39;m just trying to explain whatever I think needs explaining since most of the top comments are about people not being able to understand video.

The one that creates the first blockchain that includes the block with your payment in it, or is the fee passed on to the miner that has the longest blockchain that includes the block where your transaction occurs in? But that would mean that the fee gets passed around from miner to miner since the one with the currently longest blockchain containing your transaction received it? Or maybe the fee is for the miner that first included your transaction AND the correctness of that miners shorter blockchain is later verified by other miners with longer blockchains thereby settling who actually gets the fee. What&#39;s the technical difference when not giving the optional fee, I fail to see that as the payments are stored in a particular order and no payment has priority over another? Also, to find the binary number padded with zeroes, I suppose it&#39;s not done in a particular order as that would mean the fastest miner always wins? If so, how does the process of randomization work? How is it ensured that every miner has equal chance of finding the number, yet every miner looks for the number in it&#39;s &quot;own random order&quot;? The easiest approach would be they all start at their own particular random number and start iterating one by one from there, right?<br><br>Thank you", "comment_date": "2021-01-26T08:24:57Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Stephen Parallox", "comment_text": "As someone who works in banking and cyber security, I don&#39;t think I will ever buy a bitcoin.

I see it this way: when Alice serves someone at the coffee shop, she earns 1$. And the $ is just an agreement. We can call it Pot. So, Alice have earned 1Pot. But she she did something to earn this. She made someone&#39;s life easier and happier. To a larger scale, Vanessa made 10t of meat and she fed some people, and therefore she earned 10Pots. Because she used all sorts of inputs and her labour, she added the value to those inputs. And she fed people.<br>Question: what real value is added in Crypto currency transaction? The way I see it is that it is just another way of diminishing the value of real added value. So, the people who produce will earn less, and people who are &quot;mining&quot; will earn more. And to that matter, what do you use for &quot;mining&quot;? Crypto current, or the real current? Can you add a digital...something to raising a plant or an animal to feed someone.<br>I don&#39;t say that I&#39;m right?

This is the major fact why I can\u2019t let my BTC lay back in my wallet not knowing what tomorrow holds for it, rather I trade with a society tested and trusted firm ( Carolyncrypto&#39;s) who\u2019s strategy has helped me accumulate more Btc and my portfolio has grown so big in a short time of intense trading.Y\u2019all can reach out to her, for her awesome stratagy services on <b>reaconhack on telegram</b> and thank me later \ud83d\ude0a\ud83d\udcaa\ud83c\udffb", "comment_date": "2021-01-05T21:00:35Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Jerry Lisaa ___ Pofind2 on telegram", "comment_text": "Poverty reduces by <b>reaconhack on telegram</b>", "comment_date": "2021-01-05T20:51:52Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Jerry Lisaa ___ Pofind2 on telegram", "comment_text": "Poverty reduces by <b>reaconhack on telegram</b>", "comment_date": "2021-01-05T20:50:31Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "N M", "comment_text": "I love me some 3B1B, no one can explain anything on YT the way this guy does.", "comment_date": "2021-01-05T20:33:33Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Venkat B", "comment_text": "Why settle for less when you can have more by just daring to think.

Between constantly broadcasting, receiving, and checking data, there is a ton of information that needs to be synced between each user in order for the system, as a whole, to work. Right now we only have a few milliseconds of delay between users here on Earth. But, when we eventually do start to colonize the solar system, light delay is going to become a huge problem.<br><br>Interplanetary distances are so vast that even lightspeed communications will have a significant delay in travel time. Just one-way, direct communication between Earth and Mars takes 4.5 minutes at best, and 21 minutes at worst. For Saturn it would take between 1 hour, 6 minutes at best and over 1 hour, 32 minutes at worst. And all of this is without the added time of uploading and downloading the data, relaying it to repeaters elsewhere in the system to boost the signal, or sending any replies or conformations back in the other direction.<br><br>With such a massive delay in communications, computational work might not be enough to validate transactions; and a lot could change on everyone&#39;s personal ledgers while the data is still enroute.

Because given the current very low price, the current market capitalization of as much as $ 85 billion and many other positive announcements and upcoming events, only one can be concluded. Ethereum is a highly regarded system and one of the fastest growing IT projects and companies in general, ready to change the world and part of our daily news. In my humble opinion, investing in Ethereum today is like investing in Microsoft in the 1990s! Ethereum was not originally meant to be a value primarily conceived as a means of payment, but solely as a huge operating system, software platform, and decentralized supercomputer.<br>Soon when ETH significantly exceeds the $ 100 billion MCap, which is very topical now, and in fact it is only a matter of days when that will happen and when we will establish a 100% legal and generally accepted system on WallStreet to be established in the coming months a little nostalgia. . All these current, sickly ridiculous Ethereum prices. In the next 5 years, it will be a global IT company, everyone will accept and use it, and countries will fully accept and recognize this cryptocurrency as a storehouse of value, especially Bitcoin, and then Ethereum, which will eventually and easily improve and explode their value. Many other lesser known and less reliable cryptocurrencies are likely to become extinct in the meantime and go into oblivion. Some other interesting cryptocurrencies will also come to life and get a value of 100X or 1000x, which is currently safe! Namely, BTC will never become extinct. And Ethereum, in fact, ... in 5 years it will be worth at least 25% - 50% or 100% of BTC, no matter how much it will be in the future ..., I will be very sure, and it will be unimaginably much! !! Those who are fresh in these situations and who are now willing to sacrifice a small portion of their earnings and patiently save in ETH, over the next 5 years, will therefore be rewarded a hundredfold. Ethereum will exceed the price of one Bitcoin. It is no longer a question of whether this will happen, but a real question of when it will happen. Everything is very clear and I am convinced of the power of Ethereum for a better future for humanity. I&#39;m going All in !!!<br><br>&quot;And God has given you all to get rich!&quot;<br><br>...

This event and development of KIN will shape cryptocurrency market next year 2021. Regarding to legal status, KIN was sued by the SEC for allegedly conducting an ICO in 2017 while being a security, which is illegal. However, now the judge has ruled that KIN is not a security and it \u201cshould be free to trade on exchanges.\u201d This lawsuit was the reason why KIN has been an underdog in the crypto world, investors stayed away as there was a significant risk of closure of the project. KIN also decided to stop all marketing efforts in order to combat the SEC. However, now that this is resolved, KIN is the only asset besides Ethereum and Bitcoin that is classified as a non-security commodity. KIN now is well-positioned to become most used cryptocurrency in the world. In December 15th 2020, Kin migrated 55mil unique accounts to Solana network and running on Solana blockchain to scale for mass adoption, with high speed transaction of 65k transactions per second, 400mil blocks times, $0.0001 fee. This is the largest move in the history of crypto. Currently, KIN has more than 50 live apps and over 3mil monthly active spenders.

He has hosted the Mad Money program on CNBC since 2005. Cramer is also the co-founder of The Street, where he recently spoke, revealing that he was looking to make his Bitcoin portfolio bigger which is what all in bitcoin business should be aiming to do just like myself with the help of daily trade signals from Mr. Burwell Coleman. I must say, being guided by an expert seems to bridge the hindrance to understanding crypto trading, I would advise every newbie and existing investors also to seek the assistance of an expert before delving into trading any crypto asset. Burwell can be reached on tele_gram (burwellcoleman) and his Wh@tsApp (44 7723 022159 ) for more enquirers.", "comment_date": "2020-12-15T05:08:15Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Lee wong", "comment_text": "you nailed it like always and this is actually my third time watching your clips. i already invested heavily in btc which is  a huge source of my passive income and has been an eventful one for me. i started with less than $10000 and i now have a 1.73btc,courtesy of my miner.

Can we say that about the dollar?\u00a0$1\u00a0from 1913 to<br>2020 is worth ~$20\u00a0according to an inflation calculator. So, which one<br>is really volatile? People need to stop looking at the price through<br>the lens of the dollar. Everyone sees the dollar value of Bitcoin but<br>don&#39;t realize that it&#39;s the dollar that is weak against BTC....that&#39;s<br>why there are huge price swings. People also don&#39;t realize that every<br>time they sell or buy crypto, they are expanding the current monetary<br>money supply. If you know how the current monetary system works, that<br>last statement will make perfect sense. If not, it will go over<br>heads.I take the risk of lower prices on the short term for granted,<br>knowing that the prices will be much higher on the long term. I am not<br>taking the risk of not having invested what I could (because I was<br>waiting for lower prices) and than not take full advantage of the bull<br>run.There is a significant difference between stocks which can be<br>based on professional advice held and currencies (cryptocurrency), and<br>this is because most of them are hypes and highly speculative. I have<br>made over $80,000 in the last two months day trading my BTC which I am<br>sure would be a fantasy if I where hodling. I trade with a platform<br>that is highly skilled in the cryptocurrency business, I was<br>introduced by Mr Eric bishop, I am aiming for higher highs. If you<br>have any inquiries, you can reach him on Gmail(eric.bishop100@gmailcom) I am spreading this for those who<br>are unable to turn in consitent profit in the crypto market<br><br><br><br>I started investing in Cryptocurrency fairly recently. Coming from a<br>non-technical background, understanding blockchain and crypto currency<br>is a little tricky. So to understand it better I invested USD 1000 and<br>started to pay attention to everything related to Cryptocurrency. i<br>made 2 BTC real quick in 2018, later lost 1BTC early 2019, i was still<br>trying hard to understand the market but everything was new to me<br>again (nightmare). I began to read several blog post and following<br>YouTube video tutorials to understand how I can make profit but the<br>more I try, the more I loose more of my Bitcoin. So not until I found<br>a beginners trading post talking about a strategy on how to trade and<br>make profit and I contacted the person in charge, Mr bishop he<br>explained to me the different ways to make profit in this bearish<br>market. I decided to give it a try and I invested 2 BTC of my coin,<br>and it quickly rose to 8 BTC towards the end of December 2019,and I<br>was convinced it is the best way to make a good profit from Bitcoin.<br>If you&#39;re still confused about the steps to take this year I urge you<br>to contact\u00a0Eric.bishop100@gmail.comfor all<br>your cryptocurrency questions, strategy and beginners coaching.?<br><br><br><br><br><br>My best guess is that money pours into crypto during the first 2<br>quarters of the year as people get their tax returns and invest in<br>projects they like. During this time I expect a significantly rising<br>overall &quot;market cap&quot;. I think it will cool off some during the summer<br>and pick back up around the holidays as families and friends get<br>together and reflect on 2020. During this time I believe we&#39;ll see<br>periods with bitcoin gaining faster than alts, followed by times where<br>alts are more profitable. The smart, stress free investor is hedged<br>into several crypto projects as opposed to &quot;all in&quot; on one or<br>frequently switching back and forth between alts and bitcoin. The<br>market will likely remain volatile but I believe with QUALITY cryptos,<br>highs will be higher and lows will be higher.Those with patience<br>who&#39;ve only invested money they can afford to lose will likely<br>outperform most &quot;traders&quot;. I think changing tax laws in first world<br>countries will further embolden the HOLD mindset, as (in the US) there<br>is a huge benefit to investors holding assets over a year, much higher<br>taxes for assets held under a year. I think these changing tax laws<br>will also encourage investors to look harder at projects they are<br>comfortable Holding for over a year, so some of the pump and dump<br>energy will fade. feel free to get in touch with my trusted broker<br>davislingardcrypto11@gmail.com\u00a0and he will be sure to provide you every<br>necessary info you may need to invest wisely in bitcoin and alt coins<br>.<br><br><br><br>When I first heard about cryptocurrency I was not interested because<br>my mindset was what changes will it bring to the world but when I<br>began to carry out some deep research of what it is about I was more<br>than interested because the opportunities it presents is very wide and<br>can equally make someone wealthy. I read several posts and equally got<br>to know about trading and some exchanges that I can equally get this<br>done. I started to buy some bitcoin in early 2020 because the market<br>outburst in December 2019 was more than enough for me to have a belief<br>that yes cryptocurrency is here to stay. I decided to carry out some<br>trading without proper knowledge of how to trade or what trading about<br>and also I lack proper knowledge of how the market trends go because I<br>was thinking that there will always be an upward trend in the market.<br>I invested in some coin that eventually ran out of the market in 2019<br>it didn&#39;t work out the\u00a0 way I thought it will be, I was so sad i<br>wanted to give up on bitcoin I stop trading for some months because of<br>the fear of loss, I came across a youtube video May this year where I<br>saw some individuals showering praises on this trader Davis Lingard,<br>so I contacted him his trading signals are really accurate unlike any<br>signals I ever have seen, he ask me some few questions at first making<br>sure if I was making profit not losing, I put confident on him I bet<br>you his signals are unlike others, he helped me generate my 1BTC into<br>5BTC in two weeks and three days I was so amazing because I was tired<br>of constant losing of my coins here is his contact via Email<br>davislingardcrypto11@gmailcom\u00a0 for<br>inquiries and other insights into trading.", "comment_date": "2020-12-03T20:34:19Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Dao Lao", "comment_text": "Beautiful love u.", "comment_date": "2020-12-03T18:33:03Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Loi Lut", "comment_text": "Yang pilih Allah like yang pilih Dajjal abaikan.", "comment_date": "2020-12-03T17:18:14Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "galleon figurine", "comment_text": "bitcoin was only $2000 when this video was uploaded.

Honestly at my early stage of life as when i just got married, Making money was so tough for i and wife cause i lost my job and i wasn&#39;t able to satisfy my wife needs anymore. She later made her way by running, and leaving three tenders kids behind. It was so terrible if i may say cause i had to hustle up by cleaning the streets so i could put food on the table for my kids and had to also shelter and cloth them. Early these year before the covid19 out break, I went for a church seminar which i saw on a platform so decided to go. Unknowingly the guest of honor was a woman named Mrs Lyra Holt Dean which i have been hearing for about 7 years now. She talked about Blockchain and Forex which i have always kept saying it is scam and forever it is. So as time went on, i kept on hearing testimony about this same woman how she has made a lot of people rich. As time went on the covid19 issue became serious that the Government had to put the whole country on a total lockdown. Things became more worst cause there was no cashflow due to the governments lockdown, Then i gained interest and decided to sacrifice with a very little amount cause i didn&#39;t have much. I reached her at contact@lyraholtdean. com<br>Truly speaking just that first investment made me a very wealthy man and also got me a well nice positioned crib and a brand new car .I was so grateful cause that impacted a lot into my life, I became a very happy man by making a facial smile for my beloved kid.

I feel obligated to recommend him and his great funds recovery strategy, feel free to reach out to him if you having issues withdrawing your funds, via his Telegram: @richardn44 and he will guide you on steps to take and get your invested capital including your bonus refunded back to you", "comment_date": "2020-10-31T04:33:08Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "WHATSAPP #\ufe0f\u20e3 \u24f5\u24f7\u24ea\u24fb\u24f7\u24fa\u24fc\u24f9\u24f9\u24f8\u24fa", "comment_text": "Now is the greatest time to buy and invest in bitcoin especially with the current rise", "comment_date": "2020-10-31T00:15:51Z", "likes_count": 24}, {"comment_by": "Sarvesh EB", "comment_text": "Amazing explanation!<br> Googled how the mining process actually works and spent many hours in understanding; was still disappointed with the answers. <br><br>Just this 1 video cleared up every single doubt of mine!

I don&#39;t understand something ...<br><br>You say that the number of starting zeros to obtain as a proof of work changes periodically so it takes on average 10 min to find a new block. I don&#39;t understand: if you find how to get 1 zeros, 2 zeros, 3, 4 ... all the way to 30, well you can store it and just try these specific values for the next time, because once you found it, you don&#39;t have to find it again (I assume SHA256 is an injective function). And 2^30 attempts are easy to perform, so it will be easy for me to get the value that gives all those 30 first hash (1 zero, 2 zeros , ... 30 zeros) and store them in my personal dictionnary, and reuse them later.<br><br>You will ask me: why would you stop at 30 ? I don&#39;t stop at 30, it can be more, but it cannot go up to 256, which would make the proof of work actually impossible to achieve.<br><br>So my point is : Either the number of zero to obtain is too large so it&#39;s impossible to get the proof of work, or it is more reasonable, but then you can just store it, and for the next time you can just try everything you&#39;ve stored previously. It would take you less than 256 attempts, which is instantaneous for a computer.<br><br>So why does it actually requires work, if there are only 256 possibilities (presumably way less because no one can calculate how to start with 200 zeros) ?<br><br>My hypothesis is that it doesnt have to start with zeros, it can be any sequence of 0 and 1.

This holds especially true when considering that the $12,500 level hasn&#39;t been touched in over 13 months. Currently, analysts are making $16,000 price targets partially due to a CME gap and the expectation that U.S. inflation will rise higher. Bitcoin has racked up a 48% gain year-to-date and there is no evidence of weakness. The largest daily drop over the past five months was -6.4% on August 2. My only advice for investors/newbies is to take advantage of Caitlin Long&#39;s program, a Pro trader who is helping investors AND newbies accumulate more bitcoin through her amazing trading strategy. With her program i went from having 1.2btc to 9btc in less than 3 weeks. You can reach her via email caitllinlong at gmail dot com or via telegram for faster communication at caitlinlong36 for more insight on her program.", "comment_date": "2020-10-14T22:23:07Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Silber Block", "comment_text": "Use Minecraft seeds hash functions?<br>If so we&#39;re doomed", "comment_date": "2020-10-14T16:08:28Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Carl Mannhard", "comment_text": "So basically, this crypto technology is just there to ensure that nobody gets ripped off without having to have a bank there to ensure it. If the trust for governments and their central banks go completely out the window, people are putting their bets on this de-centralized currency. <br>Very cool, but I would still bet on the already established currencies for the time being. This could very well be a good, safe store of value, if it truly is &quot;un-hackable&quot;, but it will only go up in value if demand for it increases. The supply part of it is already established, which is reassuring, but It&#39;s the definition of speculation to buy it as an investment. It&#39;s sort of like a pyramid scheme where those that already own it can only make money if new people stream into it, and where the ROI decreases the higher the price. The technology can be used to create any number of new, equally secure digital currencies. The case for Bitcoin in that case is only that it&#39;s &quot;already established&quot; and popular as a currency which justifies its price, but why would you in that case abandon the dollar, peso or yen? You could say the same thing about those, and since they are already being turned into digital currencies with their own ledgers and keys, why would you swich over? What would be the purpose?<br>This is as far as I get in my reasoning. Am I missing something?

That is a mistake I won&#39;t make again!   My $100 worth of bit coin when it was less that 0.10 per coin would have made me a different man today!  But there&#39;s a reason for everything, isn&#39;t there!\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>I&#39;ve been using the Pi Network App for a good while now and as much as I try to dig for the flaws so far, I have come up empty handed.  I have researched each founder, as well as others that have been involved.  I have read the reviews, which many are speculative in both directions of acceptance.  ultimately, we have an App that does not ask for any personal information, no crazy permissions, does not burn battery, and is easy as Pi (pun intended) to use and build up a decent stock pile of rewarded Pi Coins.  The company is very transparent in the fact that this is still in Phase 1, it&#39;s a beta program, and that they Pi Coin currently has absolutely no value, cannot be traded or used in transactions, but that it will ultimately be up to us users and our involvement and interest that will drive it&#39;s growth as a &quot;Social Currency&quot;.  This shouldn&#39;t be mistaken with a previously released Pi Coin that has failed miserably before and there is not affiliation between the two.  \r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>Ultimately, someone would have absolutely nothing to lose at this time.  Even if it doesn&#39;t take off, then so be it, it was fun to race for coins.  But if it does take off as it seems to be expected to and hoped to, then this could change many aspects of how cryptocurrency is utilized in this world and provide a more fairly distributed wealth system with greater accessibility and a more broad e-commerce adoption for every day simple transactions.  I personally predict that their end game, in order to remain internalized, secure, and to be sure the middle man and governments keep their hands out of this currency, is to ultimately become their own bank.  This can be accomplished easily and I can see them issuing personalized debit type cards to existing users to spend their pi in every day stores and even eventually creating a loan and credit system, all of which will convert the values into whichever currency you are needing to spend it in.  This will be the key to allowing a broad adoption and high frequency of transactions across the globe.  No more limitations for the common user with expensive mining hardware and costs, limited investing knowledge, or fees from third party investment companies and institutions.  They can retain all control to keep the people money &quot;for the people&quot;.  Think of a Paypal type system meets Square Payments, both bucking the trends of typical banks and making life a little cheaper and easier for people.  This is by no means a guarantee and i could go much deeper into details, but that sums up my &quot;idea&quot; and hope for the future of Pi, and it seems like some of their current choices may be leading to this type of end result.

When people trade in Bitcoin, more often then not they aren&#39;t looking for a stable form of currency, rather they are looking to buy low and sell high.  For myself, I might invest in a little VC of one type or another, but I would never accept payment in VC because, among other things, I couldn&#39;t be sure the value wouldn&#39;t plummet any time after I was paid.<br><br>Think of real currencies like a metro pass.  Metro passes are the currency of the metro.  When I hold a pass the metro is in debt to me.  I am owed a ride on a train.  The same idea works for theater tickets, arcade tokens, and another token that can be used to purchase something real and tangible.  Why would a company redeem these paper and plastic tokens for things of real and tangible value?  Societal laws.<br>What about Government fiat?  What is it the promise of?  The answer is that anyone who wishes to participate in society and reap the benefits of it has to pay taxes of one form or another.  Taxes are enforcible by the state and failure to pay them will result in a loss of currency, property or freedom.<br>So it&#39;s not what fiat is redeemable for, but what it prevents that gives it value.  Since we all find ourselves in a similar situation, we trade in fiat.<br>So again, I ask anyone, what is crypto the promise of?  And please, don&#39;t tell me &quot;freedom from government oppression&quot;  Give me a real tangible answer, because the way I see it, crypto isn&#39;t the promise of anything at all.  It is the ultimate Ponzi scheme.  However it&#39;s spread so wide and so far, it may work in perpetuity.  There won&#39;t be any big crash, rather it will just circulate around creating winners and losers.<br>There are other substantial problems of replacing government fiat with crypto unless people here believe that crypto will always work alongside government currency.<br>Thoughts?", "comment_date": "2020-06-12T15:04:11Z", "likes_count": 24}, {"comment_by": "anurag kalkar", "comment_text": "Aren&#39;t they very inefficient this way ? why should we even get into it even if it a fool proof thing", "comment_date": "2020-06-11T17:52:00Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Bal\u00e1zs Uszkay", "comment_text": "Who were those brave 1,090 people who disliked the video?!", "comment_date": "2020-06-11T13:55:42Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Kaithy Berry", "comment_text": "Bitcoin is not  a scam, but lots people use the opportunity to scam people, investors, fake bitcoin website, that will have full details of your bank and card for purchase.

Most people will misunderstand what you highlighted in your video and equally the advantage they have to learn about cryptocurrency at its early stage. I count myself lucky to know crypto at this current era and to also witness the transformation blockchain is bringing to the world economy, and with that effect, if you are not holding as many bitcoin as possible, you are simply missing up on the long run. I have been an investor of bitcoin since 2017, I buy into the fuzz during the bull run, and I was holding because I don&#39;t understand how the market work. During the dip, I was worried because the price I bought it with and the current price are two different things entirely, and so I decided to look for a mentor who will enlighten me about trading and how I can hold more bitcoin. Luckily for me, I met Dennis Stewart, who is a pro trader. he made me understand the crypto market and how he can help me to gain more bitcoin. I started implementing her strategies, and the first month, I gained up to 300% profit. I was so amazed and finally told myself that yes, I have gotten a trader to help me out when it comes to crypto trading. Now I am growing my portfolio daily with him, and I surely know that there are so many people currently into such situations who are looking to change their portfolio status, worry no more because your portfolio status can be changed if you take action today by contacting Dennis on the telegram App @dennistewart for inquiries into profitable trading systems. and WhatsApp (+16193248338), and surely your portfolio status will be very well organized again.", "comment_date": "2020-05-26T19:29:25Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Daniella Moris", "comment_text": "Trading has always made a way for me, since I started using the services of Mr Gabriele, I have not lost a single day.

It mentions that fraude is very difficult unless you have 50% of the computing power of all miners, but that doesn&#39;t make it impossible.  Let&#39;s say I first pay lots of bitcoins buying real life stuff, ex. lots of rigs to do bitcoin mining.  All that is legit (but delivered anonymously so that I remain anonymous even for the people I bought the stuff from), but now I start from a block before all those payments and recalculate all the blocks, but replacing my payments with ones with a lot lower value and I use my rigs to do the work for each of those blocks and ensure I get the longest chain by adding tiny transactions between multiple accounts I (anonymously)  have.  In the end I then would have the longest chain and hence be the reference and in doing so have changed the amount I paid for my huge rigs to peanuts and having taken over the entire block-chain (as other miners will have shorter chains, they have to pick up mine at some point, so I don&#39;t have to keep the faking up forever).  As long as the crypto currency is very active, reaching that level of over-poweredness may be impossible, but not if transactions start to drop.  And that&#39;s not even touching the big question-marks on exchange rate between the crypto currency and any other currency.  That might hold for any currency, but at least most normal ones are in some sense backed by a country which has some reason for it to behave in a certain way.  With a crypto currency you have no idea who could influence it or have a reason to want to and you don&#39;t have a country behind it that could initiate steps to stabilize it.

An anatomy of online deception.</b>  The originating organization provides an individual that has given it money with a <i>password</i> to an entry on a public ledger that serves as his <i>receipt</i> so that he may view the record of this transaction at any time. This contribution is essentially a gift. Contributions are sought in discrete amounts, such as fifty cents. The password to access the receipt for each of these fifty cent gifts is titled a <i>key</i> and employing a misnomer the record of the amount of the gift is titled a <i>crypto coin.</i> <br><br>These are not deposits, the amount may not be withdrawn and the individual is not entitled to a refund. Members of the originating organization may in turn again gift the money that has accrued to them to their own organization in order to issue receipts to themselves and may do this as many times as they wish. No regulations hinder them and it costs them nothing. Crypto is <i>not</i> currency even if a merchant accepts it in barter.<br><br>In order to recover part, all or even more than his expenditure the individual may sell the right to view the entry for his transaction that serves as his receipt for the gift that he has made and provides the new purchaser with the key. The new purchaser in turn may likewise sell his right to view this entry to the online ledger to someone else. That is what is being traded. The right (password titled a key) to view a receipt (record of the amount on an online ledger titled a coin), nothing more that in itself is of no intrinsic value.<br><br><i>At its inception crypto currency enabled persons engaged in illicit activity to make payments to each other avoiding government scrutiny.</i> Each dollar entry to the ledger is publicly visible while concealing the name of the individual. Only the individual has the key. If this is lost he cannot bring up his transaction, as the key is not retrievable. Nor can anyone else. The relevance of block chain technology to this scheme is that it prevents hacking as well as discovering who made a particular payment.<br><br>The originating organization continues to issue the right to view receipts for contributions, euphemistically titled coins, without anyone actually having sent it money, to the party that correctly guesses the characters by which each receipt is identified. The party to whom the keys are awarded must update the ledger. They are compensated for their <i>mining</i> service by selling their keys. <br><br>More money may be squeezed out of the process. Exchanges have been set up in order to facilitate trading of these receipts called coins and to store in a wallet the passwords, called keys. If you lose the password you cannot view the ledger entry that serves as a receipt leaving you with nothing to sell.<br><br>That anyone is willing to pay money to view a receipt for which the original holder received nothing defies rational logic. That others purchase this right from them for huge sums of money is even less credible. The system crashes when it runs out of gullible victims to whom the right to view a ledger entry may be sold.<br><br><br><b>Footnotes:</b><br><br>The above discussion provides a <i>conceptual</i> analysis so that details do not obscure the process. The block chain is a shared public ledger. In practice, an individual installs a crypto wallet on his computer that generates a crypto address and includes a private key with which to sign transactions.

We know gold is scarce, but we&#39;ll never know how many ounces will ever be mined.  Somebody could hit a pocket of pure Gold the size of Texas and there goes the scarcity argument.  That cannot happen with Bitcoin.  Plus, Bitcoin is easily transported and easily stored which is not true of Gold.  Bitcoin beats all other world currencies in that the purchasing power actually increases over time instead of decreasing like Dollars.  If you put 10 Bitcoin or 10 one dollar bills in your sock drawer 10 years ago which will buy you more today?  That is an excellent store of purchasing power.  If you buy 1 Bitcoin today for $7,500 or put $7,500 one dollar bills in a box under your bed, which do you think will be able to purchase more ten years from now?  I have to believe Bitcoin will continue to increase in purchasing power whereas the dollar will continue to be inflated away.  Also, each Bitcoin can be sub-divided into 100 Million smaller money units called Satoshi after the creator of Bitcoin.  What happens when 1 Satoshi = 1 penny?  It means each whole Bitcoin is worth 1 Million Dollars.  What if 1 Satoshi reaches 1 Dollar?  Then every Bitcoin now has the purchasing power of 100 Million Dollars.  Seeing the past decade track record of Bitcoin why would anybody NOT put a couple hundred dollars into Bitcoin and just sit on it a few years?  You can buy over 1 Million Satoshi for less than $75 right now.  10 Million Satoshi for less than $750 right now.  A lot people piss away that much in pizza and beer.

About HEX... Everyone holding Bitcoin at the December 2, 2019 snapshot can claim FREE HEX tokens, 10,000 HEX tokens per Bitcoin (without compromising any private keys or any risk, and as always, it can be fractions of a Bitcoin - you can claim even one satoshi if that&#39;s all you had).  Yes, HEX might be a poor investment in some peoples eyes (although I honestly feel enough people haven&#39;t researched it deep enough yet), but if you use the &quot;Bitcoin Claim&quot; option on the HEX website, it costs you nothing, with zero risk, and yes, HEX could go to zero, like many projects have, or, the HEX token goes up in price in a year or two and you trade it back for ETH and make a decent profit from your free entry and zero risk &quot;investment&quot;.  It&#39;s actually a very interesting project.  <br><br><br>It&#39;s the ONLY referral program I know of that actually rewards BOTH the &quot;referrer&quot; AND the new person signing up.  The referrer gets 20% and the new HEX token holder receives and extra 10% of HEX tokens simply by using ANY referral link!  It&#39;s a great marketing tool, and great for adoption.<br><br><br><br>Why not claim some free HEX?  It might go to zero, it might go to the &quot;moon&quot;, only time will tell.

Ik begon met hem te werken rond april, ik moest stoppen met mijn baan in mei toen ik wekelijks ongeveer 27 duizend Amerikaanse dollars verdiende vanuit mijn slaapkamer. Dit is niet zo goed om waar te zijn en ik werd niet betaald om dit te schrijven ... Ik gebruik dit alleen om hem dankbaarheid te tonen voor zijn hulp. Ik, mijn familie en vrienden zullen voor altijd dank aan hem blijven omdat hij ons de juiste weg heeft gewezen. Ik zal hem aanbevelen aan iedereen die ge\u00efnteresseerd is in het leren mijnen van bitcoin, het terughalen van gestolen crypto-portefeuilles en het optimaliseren van uw bitcoin / crypto-inkomsten.

I have just one problem with the example you used : &quot;Alice pays Bob $100&quot;, saying that Bob can replicate the message over and over and will benefit him is wrong... It&#39;s the opposite ! Giving $100 to the pool means the pool owes you a $100. So replicating this message benefits Alice not Bob. As if she (for example) replicates the message 5 times, the other participants will think that she is $500 down and so they must compensate this at the end of the month. Am I crazy or not ?

The graphic show that the Alice signature changes from one message to another message is not quite what you showed. Here is correct sequence of event:<br>1 - Alice use an hash algorithm tool - SHA256 - for example to produce a hash from her message.  The hash copy is called &quot;message digest&quot;.<br>2 - Alice then signs the &quot;message digest&quot; with her private key.  The result of this is a digital signature.  Now keep in mind Alice always uses her private key to sign any &quot;message digest&quot; and there private key never changes.  Your animation shows that the signature Alice keeps changing from one message digest to other is quite confusing and technical speaking is not correct.  In other words, you short cut the step of how Alice produces the &quot;message digest&quot;.  No, Alice does not sign a message with her private key.

Would that not make it possible for a transaction to just accidentally be left by the wayside? How do the miners know what transactions have been broadcast? Wouldn&#39;t leaving a transaction out while someone else includes it in their block create forking blockchains? One fork for each individual way transactions are organized? Or is it that miners know that it has already been included in a block, and therefore everyone computes the others without it? And the overtaking of fradulent chains would then happen, because the others have a different list of ransactions already included and yet to be included. So you can&#39;t just leave out a single transaction out of yours, because it would autocorrect on the blockchains of the others.<br>Wouldn&#39;t this also mean that whenever a block is completed, every other miner has to stop working on their block?<br>So i guess having a big transaction fee would help with having it included sooner or something? Because everyone wants to have the blockchains with the highest transaction fees to them...<br>But that would mean that if someone right now included a transaction with 0 transaction fees, it would be left by the wayside indefinitely, because everyone else would want to pick better transactions to include.<br>Unless of course you have less transactions happening than it takes time to mine a block, so you actually can fill up blocks and leaving transactions out wouldn&#39;t matter, since it doesn&#39;t change the work you need to do and there&#39;s still room for more.<br>But that would make the incentive system meaningless, since everyone includes all the transactions in the block anyway.<br>And what happens if the number of transactions permanently exceeds 1700 per 10 minutes? Wouldn&#39;t that just lead to an infinitely growing backlog of transactions that need to be included in a block?<br>Both lead to problems, so the only solution is to have often less, but sometimes more transactions per ten minutes, but that can&#39;t be guaranteed.<br>What will happen if bitcoin grows too big, and 1700/10min just doesn&#39;t cut it any more?

You can mail him** (jameslong241 @ Gmail. com) if you need his assistance too. A word of caution, never mix emotion with coins if you want to succeed and you have to be brutal as well i.e sell, buy, and trade when you have to follow the rules and always seek help if you are not already a master trader and are not making good and consistent profit on your own already.", "comment_date": "2019-03-02T10:42:27Z", "likes_count": 8}, {"comment_by": "Brodiot", "comment_text": "Thank you so much!

All 4 miners have roughly equal computing capabilities. Alice and Bob are not miners and cannot contribute computational work. We&#39;ll say Alice and Charlie are secretly two accounts belonging to the same person, although that is not critical to the situation.<br>Let&#39;s say Alice is attempting to commit fraud. Alice is paying Bob $100, and broadcasts that transaction to Bob, and only 2 of the miners. Alice broadcasts a fraudulent transaction, say Alice pays Charlie(Alice&#39;s own account) $100, to the other 2 miners.<br>Now Miners 1 and 2 have a correct block and Miners 3 and 4 have a fraudulent block that they think is accurate. 2 blocks with proof of work will be broadcast, one block with the correct transaction and one block with fraudulent transaction. We now have a fork in the road. The Miners will continue working on their current blockchain. However, since each side (Miners 1+2 and Miners 3+4) both have roughly the same amount of computational power, they can both contribute the same amount of work, and therefore the same amount of blocks. Because of this, no one fork will outpace the other, and both will maintain somewhat equal length.<br><br>This is where the confusion, especially for the Miners, sets in. Each fork will have roughly the same amount of blocks, and therefore, no one will know if they were working on the correct fork, or are still working off of the fraudulent transaction. Bob might know which is correct if he was expecting a transaction; he can look through the blocks at the beginning of each fork and determine that the block where he gets paid from Alice is accurate. But even then, since Bob has no computational power, he cannot contribute work to the correct chain in an attempt to prove that is the correct chain. To top it all off, Charlie can even claim he was expecting a transaction from Alice.<br><br>So even if Bob picks up what is happening, how will the Miners? How can they settle which fork is correct?

Why are there so many different ones, and why do so many companies want to jump into the cryptocurrency market?<br>- Why does the conversion rate keep going up? I understand supply and demand as taught in school, but why do people place such a high value on cryptocurrency to the point that Bitcoin is a five-figure conversion to USD?<br>- What is to stop a large set of miners from collaboratively gaming the system and placing large values of crypto to themselves in a hash? In fact, are there large mining operations or is it more of an individual miner operation? &lt;-- Sheer scale of mining a SHA 256 hash (2^256 is LARGE)<br>- Can you dive into the actual uses of cryptocurrency? What does it mean to use it to pay for a haircut or cars? Is it a recognized cash form if I was to walk into a car dealership or a barber, or is it that I have to know someone&#39;s crypto address and pay them, and then we mutually understand (recognized on the ledger) that the service or item has been paid for?<br>- Since it takes nearly 6 blockchains for your crypto transaction to be considered trusted as recognized, doesn&#39;t that make crypto a bit flimsy for large purchases?

At <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBC-nXj3Ng4&amp;t=21m00s\">21:00</a> you give an example of Alice paying Bob 100 LD and not broadcasting it to the rest of the network.  She was able to add this block because she found a number that generated a hash with say 30 0&#39;s in first 30 digits before the others.  The thing is, how can we trust the other miners on the network?  What if, on top of Alice, Bob or some of the other miners were also a fraud.   So, can&#39;t it be possible that both block chains are false since other users are also broadcasting incorrect transactions?   You state the protocol just simply says to trust the longest blockchain, but I just can&#39;t see how it guarantees that the longest one can be trusted.  Are you saying that someone who comes with malicious intent will always either eventually give up or lose in trying to screw the blockchain up because they lack the computational power to do so?  And for that reason, they will simply just be honest instead?  What if you have a case where 10% of the miners are being honest, and the other 90% (which are many different people) are broadcasting incorrect transactions intentionally?  What happens then?  Does the system somehow guarantee that the blockchain follows the 10%?  Or is just mathematically unlikely that we encounter a situation where 90% are dishonest.

First is fees.<br>So a miner decided what transactions are on the block it&#39;s working on, so most will just add the top 2,400 transactions with the highest fees. Alright. <br>But where are the transactions stores in the meantime? Not a &quot;Block&quot; in the blockchain, I presume? Is there a bit of data in between the blocks, with all the new transactions waiting to be put in a block?<br>Assuming there are more than 2400 transactions per block with fees, and this continues for years, all the transactions that haven&#39;t made the cut yet must be held somewhere, right? <br><br>Secondly, I feel that per transaction verification was just glossed over. A miner will take the 2,400 transactions it thinks it wants, checks the hash on each to make sure it&#39;s legit, if so adds it to it&#39;s desired block and starts chipping away at it. Everyone&#39;s mining their own version of the block, presumably with &quot;Pay 12.5 coins to me&quot; and the most fees in it. Cool.<br>But once a block is mined, and added to the blockchain, how do the other miners know if it&#39;s safe to keep mining based off this block? How do they know it doesn&#39;t have bad transactions in it?<br><br>Do they go &quot;Well, let&#39;s check the transactions in there, ah, this one&#39;s bad, must be a fake block, I&#39;ll ignore it and keep mining&quot;?<br>Thus all the &quot;good&quot; miners keep only bothering with the good chain, and an &quot;evil&quot; miner group would have to keep toe to toe with them forever to keep up?<br><br>So, all this proof of work isn&#39;t checking how legit the transactions are, it&#39;s just saying &quot;I checked them, they&#39;re all cool&quot;? Literally proof of your work.<br><br>I&#39;d ask why not just have the users run checks on the transactions themselves then, but &quot;mining&quot; is just a way to sync the blockchains, not verify transactions, as transaction verification is just a simple hash check anyone can do.<br>(I do assume both the signature and public key are published with each transaction, yes?)<br>But that&#39;d be so laborious that we use mining to perform both tasks.<br><br>How about balances? When do we check if someone actually has the balance to send you something? Is this more work for the miners, in the pre-block stage? Check not only that the transaction&#39;s signature is valid, but that the sender had the available funds to do so?<br>Are they going back through the entire history to check this, or, at the end of every transaction, do they just write a little &quot;Now alice has 0.21 bitcoins available&quot;, so you only need to check the last block they sent or received something with?<br><br>Thanks to anyone who bothers taking the time to explain this shit to my stupid little head, I really appreciate it.", "comment_date": "2017-12-17T12:15:53Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Zahaid Rahman", "comment_text": "Can you please explain other designs.", "comment_date": "2017-12-17T11:37:56Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Roberto Boateng", "comment_text": "Subscribe + Like + Share + Multiple comments + A great THANK YOU for this video and all your other works.

The coin is now in it\u2019s Initial Coin Offering phase, but it is anticipated that the price will increase considerably when the coin launches on 1 November 2017.   <br>Reasons why Electroneum is a great investment right now:<br>It\u2019s developed with the mobile user in mind, meaning that 2.2 billion phone users around the world will be utilize it.<br>It introduces mobile mining, meaning that you can use your own phone to check transactions in the blockchain and earn additional coins.<br>The mobile mining app will function like a game - allowing users to compete against peers, invite their friends, and see who can mine the most coins. This all helps to spread the word and get more users on board.<br>Users will be able to send Electroneum coins to another user quickly and easily using only their phones.<br>Electroneum has a great team! Most of them are well-known in the tech industry and have worked on various social media applications in the past.<br>Great marketing! According to their white paper, a considerable amount of the raised funds will go towards marketing Electroneum to the world. More users = more transactions = an increase in value!<br>Electroneum brings together the best of both decentralized and centralized worlds. The blockchain will be decentralized, meaning that all transactions will be checked by a network of mining computers around the world, while the app is centralized, allowing it to function as a marketing powerhouse to introduce Electroneum to the masses!<br>It is still cheap! Right now Electroneum is selling for around $0.01 per coin. This price will increase considerably when the coin goes live on 1 November 2017.<br>Electroneum is still in its infancy, but has all the right ingredients to go viral.

Electroneum<br><br>GO HERE TO PARTICIPATE <a href=\"https://my.electroneum.com/join/37C9BB\">https://my.electroneum.com/join/37C9BB</a><br><br>The Electroneum ICO is well under way with their website currently displaying sales of over 569 bitcoins. What is Electroneum? They\u2019re aiming to target the globes 2.2 billion smart phone users with their new coin that can easily be mined on smartphones. It\u2019s been built on its own blockchain and has now launched its ICO to gain funds for the project. They\u2019re aiming to make crypto currency easier to understand for the average person. They feel that its far too complicated for the average person to get involved with crypto and hope to make crypto accessible to all.<br>Users will be able to control all aspects of the new currency from their smartphone. The new platform will use the CryptoNote algorithm, used by popular currencies such as Monero and ByteCoin. Mining electroneum 2.jpg The new crypto currency will be available to mine with a simple app. Rather than the user being presented with an option of either buying an expensive mining rig or sending their ID to a random exchange to buy coins all you\u2019ll need to do to get started with Electroneum is download a free app. Installing the app (from Apple or Android) means that the user can start mining the currency instantly, even when the app is running in the background you\u2019ll still be gaining coins.<br><br>They claim that the app will use very little bandwidth so will be cheap for the user to mine and won\u2019t require any technical ability. High coin supply They\u2019re going to have a total supply of 21 billion coins, they claim this is so that transactions will be based on just 2 decimals, so that transactions will have a similar feel to FIAT transactions. Rather than with bitcoin you often see transactions such as: 0.000472 which can look strange to users with little knowledge of crypto currency. One of their main selling points seems to be that the new currency will be much easier to understand with the simple 2 decimal place payment system and the easy to use app for mining. Target Market The team claim that they have 2 main targets for their marketing: Gaming (computer gamers) The retention rate of multiplayer online games after the first 30 days is just 20%. They\u2019ll be targeting this market so that gamers can use the new virtual currency to transfer some of their earnings to new games by monetizing their in game currency. The new platform will target game company owners by offering them a commission on any exchanges they generate when players exit their game.<br><br>Gaming (gambling market) Many gaming companies now accept bitcoin as a form of payment. The problem is many people find bitcoin complicated and hard to purchase. Over 2 billion people in the world still don\u2019t have a bank account, this is a market that gaming companies are desperate to target. Electroneum state that their new currency will help to solve this problem by allowing users to mine coins from their mobile phone which could then be used for gaming. Winnings can then be paid back to the users wallet.<br><br>The team decide to start developing a crypto currency that improves on what is currently available.<br>Mining pool software: To make mining easier, with open source so that others can develop their own pool. Blockchain explorer: Used to verify payments on the blockchain. Third party API: So that third parties can accept the currency as payment. Why should you invest? Electroneum state that their new currency will be much easier to use than those currently on the market and aim to appeal more to the mass market.<br><br>The team behind the currency have a history of founding successful companies and are already a properly registered British company. Duncan Logal, he CEO of Rocketspace who helped huge companies such as Uber and Spotify has also publicly tweeted that this will be the first ICO that he\u2019s investing in. Roadmap The official roadmap will depend on the amount of funds that is raised but they say that the general roadmap will be as follows: Global translations of the app. Integration of a global SMS system authenticate users and make the transfer of coins even easier. International promotion of the new platform. Development of a GUI CPU miner that is capable of running in Windows and a more accessible GUI wallet for Windows. They\u2019ll be building a virtual currency exchange app.<br><br>Conclusion They have a solid team behind them with a great track record. The high token supply may be an issue for some but their point on making crypto payments similar to FIAT with a 2 decimal point system does make sense.<br><br>Links: GO HERE TO PARTICIPATE <a href=\"https://my.electroneum.com/join/37C9BB\">https://my.electroneum.com/join/37C9BB</a><br>Whitepaper: <a href=\"http://electroneum.com/overview-white-paper.pdf\">http://electroneum.com/overview-white-paper.pdf</a>", "comment_date": "2017-10-14T10:25:33Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Isaac Serafino", "comment_text": "Are you sure &quot;private key&quot; is synonymous with &quot;secret key&quot;?", "comment_date": "2017-10-12T20:06:54Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "susannah britcher", "comment_text": "Everyone interested in Crypto should watch this.

It is very difficult to open accounts on South Korean exchanges if you do not live in Korea. Phone number and a bank account is needed along with proof of identity. I want to take full advantage of this opportunity because it is so real. I will take 50% of profits after fees for withdrawal, trade fees, and fees for sending your money back. We will only trade when we both are in agreements on everything. Really the only thing we need to build is trust to make easy money. I have a couple ways in mind for the both of us to build trust.

It&#39;s not that nobody has found a way yet, its because it is impossible. The reason is, that there is no 1-to-1 relationship between the elements of the set of inputs (pre-images) and the set of output (hashes) of the cryptographic hash function, or in other words: It&#39;s because a hash function is never bijective. This means that information is lost during the transformation, which prevents the reversal. <br>To clarify with an example: The SHA-256 function has a hash of 256-bit for all inputs, this means that there are overall just 2^256 hashes which is roughly 1.16*10^77. That&#39;s all there is and can be.<br>Now lets take a simple passphrase made up of 35 ASCII characters. Such a message length alone carries 256^35 or roughly 1.94*10^84 bits. And you can insert input of any length into SHA-256, not just 35 characters. The set of pre-images is thus practically infinite, while the set of hashes is limited to 1.16*10^77 elements. Thus information loss occurs, which can not be reverse (retrieving information from nothing doesn&#39;t work). It&#39;s thus not because nobody has yet found a way, but because it&#39;s impossible to reverse a hash function due to loss of information.", "comment_date": "2017-07-08T10:28:48Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Varun D", "comment_text": "Love the shout out to Welch Labs @<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBC-nXj3Ng4&amp;t=13m09s\">13:09</a>", "comment_date": "2017-07-08T10:12:54Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "David Andersson", "comment_text": "Great video.
