Here&#39;s what I wrote, when I wrote it (which hurts to read because of the cringe, but it shows how interested young me was in math, which I think is cool).<br><br><br><br><br><br>&quot;I came to this conclusion by first looking at the differences between the perfect squares, specifically the difference between the &quot;current&quot; perfect square and the &quot;next&quot; one, and how this came out to be the sequence of 1, 3, 5, etc. Using this, I found that 1+3+5...n is equivalent to perfect square (n+1)/2, or rather, that this odd sum always produced a perfect square that was in the same place in the sequence as n. For example, 9 is the 5th odd number greater than 0, and the sum of all the odd numbers from 1 to 9 is 25, which is the 5th perfect square (starting with 1).\r<br>\r<br>This is more formally expressed as:\r<br>\r<br>Let n = a positive odd integer.\r<br>\r<br>((n+1)/2)^2 = 1+3+5...+n\r<br>\r<br>I used this equation to pull a fun mental math stunt on my other math nerd friend, being able to spit out the answer of this &quot;odd number sum&quot; nearly instantly. But, I wanted to do better, and I wanted to find a function that would find the sum of itself and all of the positive integers before it. I figured a rough estimate for this sum would be the equation that produced the &quot;odd number sum&quot; multiplied by 2. This overshot the original sum, however. I just did trial and error for a bunch of odd inputs, until I figured out that the value of the number I needed to subtract was exactly equal to (n+1)/2. I was pretty happy at this point, I believed that I&#39;d created an equation to find the sum of all integers up to a certain odd number, and it looked like this:\r<br>\r<br>Let n = a positive odd integer.\r<br>\r<br>2((n+1)/2)^2-(n+1)/2 = 1+2+3...+n\r<br>\r<br>I started the same base equation with even numbers, except changed (n+1)/2 to just (n/2) so it would have an integer solution. Plugging this in for all instances of (n+1), the base equation reads:\r<br>\r<br>2((n/2)^2)\r<br>\r<br>This equation was undershooting, however, so I decided to test a bunch of inputs, and following the pattern from the previous test, I reached the conclusion that I needed to add (n/2), which makes a lot of sense. What it essentially does is adds 1 to every other term. I believed I&#39;d reached an equation for the sum of all integers up to a certain even number, and it looked like this:\r<br>\r<br>Let n = a positive even integer.\r<br>\r<br>2((n/2)^2)+(n/2) = 1+2+3...+n\r<br>\r<br>And, basically, I&#39;m an idiot because these two equations map onto each other identically... which I honestly should have checked, before I actually decided to graph the points. Go figure. Anyway, the cleanest, simplified equation from the last one looks like this:\r<br>\r<br>(n(n+1))/2&quot;", "comment_date": "2019-11-17T23:18:24Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Aquablast", "comment_text": "<b>video starts</b><br>3B1B: &quot;Suppose you love math&quot;<br>Me: &quot;Alright this is getting pretty difficult already&quot;", "comment_date": "2019-11-17T17:56:04Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Mustafa \u00dcnal", "comment_text": "Excellent!

You&#39;ve just shown a proof, that it is an ellipse. But we know that from any other proof. The answer to the specific question, why one thinks of an egg-shape in this case, is given by the picture at <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQa_tWZmlGs&amp;t=4m12s\">4:12</a>. If you only show one focus point, there is an optical illusion of one porkier side. What one doesn&#39;t consider is the fact, that the ellipse has to be more massive downwards the cone to get the extension to the other focus point. So, in contrast to a sliced cylinder, where everything stays symmetrical, so that the two foci depart from each other symmetrical, when getting more elliptical, the first focus point at the cone-example stays where it is: it&#39;s the middle of the cone. The other focus point has to move with the doubled speed downwards, so creating a big, bulky part of the ellipse. As one always thinks about this sliced cone in terms of the symmetry of the cone itself, it always seems to be asymmetrical, how the ellipse is constructed on or in it. That is the optical illusion, that makes you think, the thing apprearing at a sliced cone must be asymmetrical.", "comment_date": "2019-08-24T08:18:28Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "tim314", "comment_text": "Video suggestion: Show a transformation from a conic section into a cylindrical section, in a way that leaves the shape of the ellipse unchanged -- demonstrating that both give the same shape.

But this particular video inspired me. I was studying for my finals after recently watching this and came across a geometry problem and was unsure how to solve it. I needed to find some point so that a right angle would form in some way (I don&#39;t recall the details), so I let my mind wander and the Theorem of Thales came to mind. Normally I would have just ignored that thought as there was no circle in the problem, but then I remembered that video and thought: Well, if there&#39;s no circle, I could just put one in there. So I defined a circle with some given points and used it to solve the problem. Later I looked into the solutions and saw that it was correct, they proposed a different way of getting there, but mine worked and was not even slower or more complicated, it was just fine!<br>And that was such a great moment for me. It made me feel like I could do more than just learn the rules and follow them, it was fun and it felt so rewarding. <br>If everything goes to plan I will attend university this fall and study physics. People warn me that it&#39;ll be lots of maths, especially in the beginning, but I&#39;m actually looking forward to that, and your Youtube channel definitely takes part in making me excited for it. &lt;3", "comment_date": "2019-06-21T15:54:16Z", "likes_count": 140}, {"comment_by": "Juvival", "comment_text": "No.", "comment_date": "2019-06-20T15:41:31Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Paul C.", "comment_text": "Loved the demo, but loved even more your discussion after it.

Secondly, they are extremely useful for me at pinpointing exactly how and why I learn certain things so strongly, something which I have been trying to figure out for years.

At this you are doing a phenomenal job. For those who are interested, I want to add finally that I find it very helpful to decompose the final problem into it\u2019s logical parts and kind of learn the parts separately as isolated facts, which are then connected to each other. As an example from this video, I \u201disolated\u201d facts such as \u201da sphere inscribed inside a cone touches the cone tangentially around the cone\u201d and \u201dtravelling any length of line tangentially from a sphere, the lines from that end point and tangent to the sphere are of equal length\u201d, which when combined together mentally produce a pleasurable sense of coherence.

Great work with the visuals - as always. <br><br>Germinal Pierre Dandelin - I am a little disappointed (no extremely disappointed) that you said no one cares about his name. First thing is this thing was not discovered/proven until 1822. Which is a huge deal! Things like calculus were discovered by 2 different people by the 16th century. And Germinal Pierre Dandelin is the one who most probably discovered that. He is most probably the reason why we call ellipses and hyperbolas and parabolas as conic sections. If it was not for him, maybe we would not have discovered that by changing the angle of the slicing plane, we can start from an ellipse, go to a parabola, and end with a hyperbola.<br><br>It is due to him I understand that parabola is an limiting case of an ellipse with one of its focal points at that curve and the other at infinity.<br><br>If that is true, then we happened to know about parabolas and hyperbolas due to him, and that deserves some respect. Not only was it disappointing, it was disrespectful to math, in general. My thoughts only.

Then author noticed that some of these lines would be better explained as being the sides of right angled triangles, simplifying the proof from using angle identities to using triangle properties. Then they realised these infinite collections of right angled triangles could be even better explained as sections through those two spheres, making the proof simpler still.<br><br>This is still an &quot;ah ha&quot; moment at the end, but a lot less magic than it seems.

Like I feel like there must be many real and converging functions that overlap over some range but that doesn\u2019t mean we can just say they are therefore the same over all ranges, yknow? And like i know, we have come across things in science that have allowed us to believe what was said about diverging series, but mathematicians like euler and ramanujan were like totally on board well before there was experimental confirmation. Why? Why were they so ok with this? What am i missing about this whole analytic continuation thing that lets people accept it and be comfortable with it?

(A 3D solution can be done with two such 2D solutions: XY and XZ.)<br><br>From that I defined the geometry in analytical terms, in order to find the point(s) of intersection, and finished it off with having a single dot product to remove the absurd intersections that sometimes go in opposite ways from the original speed vectors.<br><br>In my opinion, the most interesting situation I&#39;ve learned about while doing this, is having a bullet that is slower than the target, as it can typically intercept the target in two places (especially if its trajectory gets near the shooter), one of which appears to be as if you&#39;ve planted something on the target&#39;s path, instead of intercepting it in the sense we&#39;re more familiar about. Think of the banana skin. You could aim for the runner on his approach, while he&#39;s farther away, and try to throw it there, or you could wait a bit and drop it in front of him on his closest approach.<br><br>So that&#39;s what the quadratic equation did for me in this case, letting me also know in advance whether you could actually hit a disc moving at a certain speed away from you, even if you had a much faster bullet, for example. Maybe you couldn&#39;t rotate as fast, so you&#39;d have to wait for it to gain some distance (and diminish the angular delta). Or maybe you could still get it if you were shooting form a fast moving car? All worthy questions. In the end you get a nice and a very quick mathematical reality check, all based on two circles and just one line.<br><br>Therefore, spheres and circles are very elegant props to use when measuring Euclidean space from a mathematical standpoint. We can intuitively grasp them, as they perfectly visualize equidistance. For that reason, calipers or compasses are essentially memory devices, necessary for replicating distances in a rotational frame of reference (which isn&#39;t as intuitive for us).

Well, if you put a basketball in the floor of a dark room and use a spot light (a lantern, a match...) this light constitutes the vertex of the cone of light rays tangent to the basketball, and you can see, by the adequate angle, that the shadow forms an ellipse on the ground (varying the angle, it can be cast a parabolla or a branch of hyperbola, too.)

There is a correlation between the radii length and the eccentricity, but only because the radii length is determined by the distance. The beauty of science is that, given the finished construction of the spheres and cone, you could figure all this out by eliminating the variable radii of the regular conic sections, i. e. by turning the cone into a cylinder.

I find the diagonal proof of Cantor to be something which I find interesting  because it deals with infinity, a subject both scientific and philosophical in nature. Pure math is often only interesting to those who enjoy numbers and puzzles. I feel that to truly convert someone over to enjoying mathematics you need to show how math relates to other things and WHY it is important to understand the methods of mathematical proofs. When we make a leap in thinking we can&#39;t often put our finger on why at that moment we realize something which a moment ago we did not understand, but should have been obvious. For me, that is the moment I truly appreciate math..............it is when I realize how obvious something should have been to me all along...........but also that there are real world applications whether in science or other fields that I can now understand BETTER as a result of my understanding certain mathematical ideas. Something might apply to a particular thing you might be interested in such as abstract mathematics, but it is not until you show how that same thing makes my trip to the super market easier, by only taking left turns.
