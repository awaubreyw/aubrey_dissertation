It may be difficult to describe the frequency of a clap because it is too short but you can amplify it through an analogue system and play it back through a speaker with fidelity, however you will struggle to mathematically model it. A radar operator may find it hard to measure the speed and the position of an approaching object but it does have a precise speed and a precise position. Are quantum states probabilistic or just impossible to measure certain attributes externally? We can work out probabilities of picking a particular card from a deck but once we have picked it, probability disappears and reality is set. If you flip a coin you never get half heads and half tails you actually get one or the other, probability is just an averaging of many unknowns before they are realised or before they are measured.

It turns out that, contrary to our intuition, we never <b>observe</b> a reality &#39;out there&#39;, rather we <b>construct</b> a &#39;virtual&#39; reality within our mind that we have learned to rely on when interacting with our environment.  This interplay is illustrated brilliantly with Veritasium&#39;s video &quot;Why No One Has Measured The Speed Of Light&quot;.  For the epistemology of physics- and science in general - this seems to imply that a successful theory is an <b>assembly of mental constructs</b> with a narrow range of high credibility scores assigned to some narrow range of tenets or principles.  This image is eerily reminiscent of a wave packet - and consequently potentially can be modelled by some form of Fourier transform.  The emergence, by whatever drives physics, of such a scientific &#39;consensus&#39; necessarily means the construction of low entropy configurations in the minds = brains of the &#39;believers&#39; (used in a non-sarcastic sense) and by the second law must be paid for by a larger increase of the universe&#39;s overall entropy.  Since the second law is these days widely accepted as the origin of time itself, the increase of (relative) certainty and the existence of evolving embodied self-contained &#39;selfhoods&#39; the maintain their integrity as entities persisting over time (= going upstream on the entropy gradient in order to stay put and reproduce) may well turn out to be two sides of the same coin.  To coin a phrase: learning is staying alive.<br>This may explain to some extent the otherwise rather puzzling phenomenon that we want to understand a reality that is &#39;out there&#39; with our minds that evolved to hunt big game, avoid becoming some other creature&#39;s lunch and learning to co-operate with more-or-less like-minded others to become better equipped to maintain homeostasis in an aging universe (due to the relentless second law),  Why do hunter-gatherers invent QM and GR?  What possible survival value can that have?  <br>In my mind these possible paradigms almost force on us the realisation that our linguistic abilities and our ability to share information with each other through learning and teaching are evolution&#39;s most powerful technologies.  Since the dawn of &#39;civilisation&#39; we have become drivers of our own non-biological evolution and shapers of our own fate to a certain extent.  Since the recent times&#39; exponential growth of communication and information sharing which shows no signs of slowing down any time soon, our collective responsibility to maintain a high-fidelity of the quality of shared assemblies of mind patterns (memes, ideologies, philosophies, religions) becomes an urgent concern.  As long as a technology has limited range, its dangers are equally limited.  Once its range increases exponentially, its potential dangers can threaten its very survival.

There is no valid solution to Maxwell&#39;s equations that involves even a moderately straight beam of light with a width of the beam of 1 wavelength. If the width of the beam is that small, it will immediately start spreading out in all directions. Thus it is only because a laser pointer beam is many thousands of wavelengths in width, that it is possible for a moderately straight beam. But this means that the wider the beam gets, the more columnated the beam can theoretically be made. If you wanted to shine a laser to the moon and not have it diverge to be a mile wide on the moon&#39;s surface when it gets there, a laser pointer won&#39;t do.... oddly enough, if you give up having it be a very narrow beam in the first place, that makes it possible to make it narrower when it actually gets there. So a beam that is 1 wavelength in width must spread out in an angle thereabouts of a radian, but a beam that is 10/(2*pi) thousand wavelengths in width, can spread out in an angle that is thereabouts of 1/10000 of a radian. Which means a 632 nm wavelength red laser beam that starts out 632 micrometers in width at the beginning, 2/3 of a millimeter, and 1000 wavelengths,  can&#39;t be columnated better than a divergence of about 1/6283 radian, so after traveling for 1 kilometer, it will be 16 cm in width...... but if it starts out  6.32 millimeters in width at the beginning, the theoretical minimum divergence after traveling 1 km will be 1/10 as much, so it can spread out from .63 cm to just 2.2 cm, and the narrowest beam it can be after traveling 1 km will be possible if it starts with a width of just a bit more than that.... but that will be optimal for traveling 1 km.... after traveling 400 thousand km to the moon, it will be 6.4 km wide. So you would want it 6.3 meters in width, and then after traveling 400 thousand km, it would be possible for it to be much straighter and only spread out from 6.3 meters to twice that by the time it gets to the moon.<br><br><br>But what does this have to do with the heisenberg uncertainty principle? Well the wave nature of light, it having to satisfy maxwell&#39;s equations, places limits on how straight a beam can be given how many wavelengths wide the beam is..... but the individual photons themselves, have momentums. And where in the beam is any given photon, is more uncertain if it is a 6.3 meter wide beam, than if it is a .63 cm wide beam, which allows for its forward momentum to be more certain, in other words for it to be more precisely moving forward and not to the side, and remain columnated. And there you have the 2 parts of the heisenberg uncertainty principle, momentum and position. The wider the beam is, the more uncertain the position of a single photon can be within the beam, and therefore the straighter it is possible for it to be, the less the beam spreads out further with distance.... but constrain the beam to be a narrow beam to begin with, and that makes its momentum more uncertain, and it can&#39;t help but spread out more as it travels.", "comment_date": "2019-09-14T02:38:40Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "konjaleo", "comment_text": "at <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MBnnXbOM5S4&amp;t=12m42s\">12:42</a> you depict all masses attached to a spring as having the same frequency.

He writes: <br>&quot;To make the last point more precise, consider a mechanical comparison, perhaps a bit crude, but that speaks to one\u2019s imagination. Consider a large, horizontal circular disk, from which identical weights are suspended on springs. Let the number of such systems per unit area, i.e., their density, diminish rapidly as one moves out from the centre of the disk, so that there is a high concentration at the centre. All the weights on springs have the same period; let us set them in motion with identical amplitudes and phases. The surface passing through the centre of gravity of the weights would be a plane oscillating up and down. This ensemble of systems is a crude analogue to a parcel of energy as we imagine it to be.&quot; So there are all different oscillator but their density is higher in the center.

Motion the vector creates mass my causing movement of fluid space. Mass is a wave from creating structures with those amounts for given structure and as we say in programing higher and lower over view structures are particles of those masses that have had emergence patterns define certain particles such as relative amount of size and energies of electrons. So when forming an atom you have the prime matter theory that an particle managed to stretch out the inward facing poles of prime matter fluid space of space time allowing the poles to attract a nucleus. The surface of every particle is a wave holding all of the information about that wave which can be wrapped in multiple dimensions around another point a higher lever over view particle in this case the electrons energy can start wrapping their energies around a nucleolus. Looking at the Fourier transforms yo showed in 2d but in 3d as sheets of energies until the shell is so full of electrons then electrons can begin to wrap around the next shell to hold them together you need more attraction of mass from the nucleolus as well. Given they are normal forms the energy defining the vector that give the particle shape tends to break off in similar particle shapes but also given inefficiencies particles can loos energy while moving through space as heat, neutrinos, decay, I&#39;m sure there are others and you get things like shifting neutrinos adding and loosing mass. In any case each shell fits over each shell and break apart as equal amounts approx. of energy as that may neutrinos. Determining the side of the wave forms like in your Fourier transforms that are highest and intersected at that time in the waves motion or unequal distribution of the mass on the surface area of the wave is hard for reasons discussed in this video you also do no t know where that transforms spirograph shaped waves started tracing and what other particles bounded off of them. Say a light wave squeezing up and down between atoms or laser light carrying an entangles particle to a spooky distance and bouncing off of the sheets edge creating ripples allowing them to turn the spin of the atoms or some other structure all at once to cause action at a distance without need of time as they spin together. I&#39;ve also been watching PBS for years and I know my fringe idea since I was at central seattle that the wave edge of something cam from my trying to rethink the double slit and to me it all makes perfect sense but is difficult to describe with my language and I&#39;ve have to refine it with lessons but I had a guiding principle a few years ago that a particle is a portion of energy traveling as a vector that give the vector shape. Now how does the in motion wave shell get effected by red shift and blue shifts and how if you are closer to the part of a wave and because of a small amount of relativity further away from the next part when viewing it as a whole. I like o submit that they are moving and interacting within their physical space with the same rules as the part you are closest to and not that observing changes it unless that form of observing adds variables and energy but that it you are simple unable to be in all places so it appears different. It also makes measuring things like how entanglement can be effecting all the particles and spacetime as it travels but to me there is always a physical mechanism that is not to complicated to imagine and not just magic.", "comment_date": "2019-06-20T19:32:27Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "CommissionerSleer", "comment_text": "Excellent video as always but one minor criticism:<br>At  <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MBnnXbOM5S4&amp;t=10m52s\">10:52</a> &quot;...the momentum of any moving particle is going to be proportional to the spacial frequency of that wave&quot; and at <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MBnnXbOM5S4&amp;t=11m25s\">11:25</a> &quot;Why... should the momentum of those particles... have anything to do with the spacial frequency of that wave?&quot;. <br>That phraseology and the general layout (p = hv rather than hv = p) is implying that the momentum of a particle is determined by its spacial frequency, which would be mind-boggling but isn&#39;t true: WE can determine the momentum of a particle from its spacial frequency but it is not determined by it.

It is in the nature of wave propagation. For instance, from straight-up wave equations, not involving particle-wave duality nonsense, but just from maxwell&#39;s equations, you can&#39;t have a finite width wave just propagate in one direction without spreading out. So for instance a laser beam meets physical requirements on how little it can spread out over distance as a function of the number of wavelengths the beam is wide. There is a fundamental limit to how columnated the beam can be. And so the effect this has, on individual photons works out to be the uncertainty principle as you know it in quantum mechanics..... the wider a beam is, the less determined a photon&#39;s horizontal position within the cross section slice is known, but the more precise its momentum can be (the more directly straight-forward its direction can be), but the narrower the beam is, the more you confine its position, the less straight-forward it can be, the less constrained its momentum is. Another duality pair is momentum and energy, and another is time and frequency (like WHEN a sound occurs within an audio recording, and what frequency it is at - the fourier transform has a given frequency component represented as a constant sinusoid throughout the recording, but what does that mean if you have a tone that lasts for 1 second in the middle of a 10 minute recording).", "comment_date": "2019-01-21T03:55:20Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Adam Lindell", "comment_text": "I found your channel via the numberphile podcast.

Anyways, I find interesting nonetheless the implication of maybe realizing that we somewhat always look at the past for stars as much as for anyone else around us, just a very slight scale in the past as of the time the light took to reach us. =]", "comment_date": "2018-11-14T05:21:01Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Ryan Perrin", "comment_text": "The general uncertainty principle requires a bit of Lie Algebra as well.

So, you could see a measurement of 40 mph when the car is actually going 60 mph on average. The opposite happens when you take a longer recording; the length of the interval of positions will be quite large, so it would be hard to say where it was during that time, but the velocity measured over the interval would be very close to the true average velocity of the vehicle.

My previous comment on this got buried in the stream, so I&#39;m yelling in the hope to spark a few comments or even a &lt;3 from Grant ;-). Guitarists use beat frequencies sometimes to see if two strings are relatively in tune by listening for the beats when they play the same note simultaneously. You can adjust the tension on one of the strings while listening to the beats that emerge. If the two notes have a difference of 1Hz then you will hear a beat once every second. If they are 2 Hz apart then you will hear a beat every half second. In general, the beat frequency = 1/(f1-f2). Now here&#39;s the big connection: if you want to know exactly when two strings are in tune, how long would you have to listen? 1/0 a.k.a. infinitely long! In other words, the closer the two frequencies are the longer you have to wait to hear their beat frequencies. You can&#39;t ever know that two notes are exactly the same by listening to beat frequencies, but you can be more certain the more time you spend listening.

And if they are 2 Hz apart then you will hear a beat every half second. In general, the beat frequency = 1/(f1-f2). Now here&#39;s the big connection: if you want to know exactly when two strings are in tune, how long would you have to listen? 1/0 a.k.a. infinitely long! In other words, the closer the two frequencies are the longer you have to wait to hear their beat frequencies. You can&#39;t ever know that two notes are exactly the same by listening to beat frequencies, but you can be more certain the more time you spend listening.

This is necessary if you want your physics to be valid in all inertial reference frame. If interested, this is discussed in the Feynman lectures here (I_34-7 : <a href=\"http://www.feynmanlectures.caltech.edu/I_34.html\">http://www.feynmanlectures.caltech.edu/I_34.html</a> )<br><br>As a major in physics, here is my understanding of the story of quantum weirdness :<br>1) the Schrodinger equation translate the fact that a state with a definite energy obeys : f(t) = f(0)exp(-iEt/(hbar)),<br>    that quantum states can superpose (linear algebra), then adding H(q,p) = E and you get the most important formula of physics<br>2) for your physical laws to be consistent with special relativity (Lorentz invariant), this f(t) = f(0)exp(-iEt/(hbar)) in your system              rest frame (it may be a single particle) becomes f(r,t) = f(0)exp(-iEt/(hbar))exp(ipr/(hbar)) in a reference frame moving with a momentum p with respect to the system<br>3) because of the presence of the exp(ipr/(hbar)), the position &quot;r&quot; and the momentum &quot;p&quot; are conjugate variables (as for time &quot;t&quot; and energy &quot;E&quot;), and plays the same role as the exp(i2.pi.f.t) in your Fourier transform, thus leading to the same &quot;unsharpness relations&quot;<br>4) you see that, to get the impulsion p, one just need to take the derivative of f(r,t) with respect to the position r, and to multiply by hbar/i. This means that you no longer need to specify both position and momentum to predict the dynamic of your system. If you know f(r,t), then you can get its momemtum thanks to the procedure presented just above.<br>5) If you try to compute r.p - p.r for each direction of space, getting p by applying hbar/i.(df/dr), you will see for example that hbar/i.(x.df/dx - d(x.f)/dx) = i.hbar , which means that in quantum mechanics (position x momentum) is different from (momentum x position), which is weird in a classical physics view point.<br>We note this relation [q, p] = i.hbar, and say that position q and momentum p along the same direction of space does not commute. This comes from the fact that p can be extracted from f(r,t) with a derivative, which itself come from the exp(ipr/(hbar)) bit, this exp(ipr/(hbar)) leading to Fourier-like behaviour and to &quot;unsharpness relations&quot;.<br><br>This is the link between the Heisenberg relations, the wave-like factor , and the commutation relations.

Light is extremely fast compared to the speed of rain drops/clouds/airplanes, so the shift in frequency due to the doppler effect is too small to be measured by our sensors. We can do it with stars because they are moving VERY fast. Instead, doppler radar sends out multiple pulses and radar measures the phase of the return signal in each pulse. A moving object will reflect a different phase on the second pulse because it moved between pulses. That difference in phase divided by the time between pulses is the phase velocity in deg/s. Multiplying this by the wavelength (~10cm) divided by 360deg will give you the velocity in cm/s.<br><br>You are correct that this creates a dilemma though because the faster the object, the more likely it will cause such a large phase shift that the direction relative to the radar cannot be deduced.

Firstly, yes, the unsharpness relation is a far better term for it and the layman understanding is way off. It makes far more sense to consider the relation as a trade-off that is inherent to the fact not all observable quantities can be measured jointly. <br>The version of the relation that you described would best be considered a &#39;preparation uncertainty relation&#39; (PUR) in the sense that a state cannot be sufficiently localised for two incompatible observables (that is, ones that cannot be jointly measured). Hence, by comparing the standard deviations of the ideal measurements of these two observables on systems prepared in this state would have a product (or sum, depending on your preferred form) that fits a Heisenberg-like PUR. (Note that each of these systems would only have <i>one</i> of these measurements performed on them, as the resulting measurement would result in a collapse of the state and so subsequent measurements would lose any context to what has happened beforehand.)<br>However, there exist other forms of uncertainty/unsharpness relations that describe the situation of either a joint or sequential measurement scheme (technically also a joint measurement but most people won&#39;t have read this far anyway and I don&#39;t want to further exclude readers); in these relations we are having to see what compromises (i.e., to the sharpness of the observables) must be made in order for us to measure two incompatible observables such that we can deduce some information about both of them. In some cases this can be linked back to the PUR for these observables (assuming an appropriate measure of error, which is not so obvious in these circumstances), but that is not always the case, nor should we expect it to be.<br>Finally, I&#39;d mention that this tie is of course due to the fact that position and momentum form a canonically conjugate pair of observables, so one is the generator of evolution of the other. In such cases we do find a link to their mutual Fourier transforms and yes this reasoning can be made with regards to their ideal (or discretised) measurements. However, this is no longer true when one starts to consider additional observables, which are not Fourier transforms of one another. (A quick technical argument would come from considering a 2-level quantum system, where each ideal measurement can be described as a unit vector on a 3-dimensional real sphere, known as the Bloch sphere; any such pair of vectors that are not antipodal are incompatible but will in general not be related via discrete Fourier transforms.) These cases far outweigh those in which the above arguments can be made, though I concede that they would not have been at the forefront of Heisenberg and de Broglie&#39;s minds at the time. <br><br>As I said before, another lovely video, but I felt some clarity may have been needed, as the uncertainty relations are ultimately a non-classical aspect of the theory (and of general probabilistic theories too).", "comment_date": "2018-02-25T08:54:32Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "1hdsquad", "comment_text": "In Germany we like to eat a soup called Einstein-Heisenberg soup.

When people say &quot;you can&#39;t know the position and momentum of a particle&quot;, you really need to bring the probabilistic interpretation of quantum mechanics to make sense of that. It certainly does not mean that you can&#39;t measure both quantities. If you have a certain localized quantum state (with low position uncertainty) and measure its momentum, you will get a definite result in your detector. It is only when you prepare the same localized state and measure its momentum again that you realize the result is now different than before (and repeating this process many many times you&#39;ll conclude indeed that the uncertainty of the momentum is large). This has to do with particles in quantum mechanics not being described by its classical state (which is characterized entirely by its position and momentum) but by its wave function.

This means that no matter how precise our measurement is there must be an error associated with it because if it weren\u2019t \u0394\u0391\u0394\u0392 = 0 which violates Heisenberg\u2019s uncertainty principle. <br>If A is position and B is momentum this means that (for example) if we have a very precise measurement of A then \u0394\u0392 must increase by a large amount (which is basically what you said in the video). The thing that I would like to add here is that this principle in fact states that randomness is a property of nature, we can never be exactly sure about our measurements and what other way do we have to check if our theories are right other than measuring what we\u2019re studying?
