So he does that and it is now there, walking past the area of the wall.<br><br>Now when he goes back to his dimension he is on the other side of the infinitely tall wall, and he did not go through it, he went around it.<br><br>So this is what someone in the 4th dimension would think for an example of this for us, we have a wall covering the x, and y coordinate. So we travel to the dimension of ours that is beside us, and take a few steps. Then we go back to our dimension and we are behind the wall.<br><br>But the thing that is hard to imagine, is what the person in the 4th dimension looks like, because they live in multiple of our dimension stacked on top and beside eachother. Just as we live inside of a bunch of 2d dimensions stacked on top of eachother.<br>---------------------<br>Now what about the 1st and 0th dimensions. <br><br>Well for the first dimension it is just a noodle like line, all they have in there view is a dot. They travel around that dot by going into the noodle beside them, going forward, and going back to theirs. <br><br>As for the 0th dimension, it is just a 0 cube.

This is a great reference for medical students, residents, and for continuing medical education.  <br><br>The following is only indirectly related to the video, it may only be interesting to those interested in Bayesian inference and medical decision making.   I think your instruction on prevalence, and predictive value would also be a good instruction for medical AI researchers.  Reports on successful applications of AI in medicine are often accompanied by claims of outperforming expert physicians.  There are some pitfalls to that conclusion, one of which is the failure to consider prevalence of disease in the population of patients versus prevalence of disease in the dataset used to develop and test the deep neural network.  The decisions made by expert physicians is shaped by the prevalence of disease in the population (that the expert physician serves), and the risk (in terms of patient suffering) of a false negative result versus benefit (in terms of avoiding patient death or suffering).  The experts prior will be based on a population separate from the dataset (it is also an intuitive or fuzzy prior, rather than a measured value).   If the test cases used to compare the experts decision to a deep neural network decision are derived form a random sample of the dataset (splitting the dataset into training, validation, and test cases), then the deep neural network will  have a better prior (a measured prior likely to be close to the random sampled test subset).  The deep neural network has a head start on the expert physician.    It is also hard to eliminate the bias of an expert physician to place more importance on false negative errors rather than false positive errors.  The consequence of a false negative error are more negative for patient outcomes (patient may die of breast cancer, or require harsher treatment to survive) than a false positive error (anxiety, discomfort of a biopsy).  The expert has learned to error on the safe side for the patient&#39;s sake.   Deep neural networks can incorporate the negative effects of false negative versus false positives in the threshold for classification, but I haven&#39;t seen much use of that adjustment. Usually, the deep neural network will mathematically optimize the threshold for the greatest &quot;accuracy&quot;.  The deep neural network is being compared to the expert physician with a process for which the deep neural network was programmed for, whereas the physician is programmed by experience with patient outcomes.  There are some research results where the AI has been applied to true patient populations rather than rely on public datasets in which there may be some selection of cases submitted to the dataset.

Another thing to consider is the gold standard. If your test looks for breast cancer you can cut out the lump and look at it under a microscope. Some diseases aren&#39;t as easily clarified. For instance, since we don&#39;t have a highly accurate, easy test for pancreatic cancer we rely on imaging, demographics, blood markers, symptoms (or lack thereof) as multiple things that form a conglomerate test to increase our Bayes factor. Despite all these things we can&#39;t always get a great prediction on whether that scar in your bile duct is cancer or just a residual scar from pancreatitis you had 10 years ago. So we offer the patient a huge surgery to remove the head of their pancreas and duodenum only to find that it wasn&#39;t cancer. You can imagine the patient is happy it&#39;s not cancer but not so happy they don&#39;t have half their pancreas and have abdominal pain and maybe diabetes. Medicine is a tricky thing. Another tricky thing is operator error. Some tests depend on the skill of the lab tech, radiologist, or surgeon.

Like 99.99% of passengers are not a terrorist.  So if you had a simple &quot;test&quot; or &quot;model&quot; that simply classified each passenger as Non-Terrorist, that test would technically be very accurate:  an accuracy of 99.99%.   Sounds great right?  Everyone agrees it&#39;s a great model with such high accuracy.  WRONG!  That test would naively miss Every.  Single.  Actual.
