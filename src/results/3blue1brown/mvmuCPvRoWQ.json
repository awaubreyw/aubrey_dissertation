Starting out that way is misleading. The essence of group theory is Combinatorics, which in turn comes from (the mathematical subject of) Counting. Group theory is an heuristic of sorts to grind out the simplest and clearest proofs, and also to categorize large messy sets of things, based on similar combinatoric characteristics. Group theory is at the centre of modern mathematics, and has become a bit of a religion, albeit a useful and beautiful one. Cayley Graphs and  NxN Arrays  capture the visual heart of it and should be used much much more in conveying the ideas. Read, Pinter: A Book of Abstract Algebra; Concurrently with, Grossman and Magnus: Groups and their Graphs. Both books are very lucid expositions of the subject. They are the gateway books to understanding all 3rd and 4th year math.  Along with, R. L. Simpson: Essentials of Symbolic Logic.

The hangup is with the &quot;pure&quot; qualification of the rotation. A pure imaginary number as an additive action is a pure vertical slide... but a pure imaginary number as a multiplicative action is a slide AND a stretch, for every point on the imaginary axis except for i itself.

Do they do the same thing to every other point in the plane?  It seems like a natural conclusion is that all negative numbers (from a multiplicative view) are a positive number multiplied by i twice, and negative numbers are only a consequence of symmetry.

You just made me realize something. <br>So addition can be associated to translations and multiplication to rotations for 2D. But this is due to a strange definition of the complex multiplication. In order to preserve the multiplicative 1D structure one would expect that complex multiplication should be defined as follows: For z=2+2i, 2*z = 4+2i and 2i*z =2+4i. But then we realize that this is not interesting. What we want with complex numbers is to define an algebra such that i*i = -1. And that is what gives this particular geometric format to multiplication. So by adding a dimension, or a set of numbers linearly independent to the real line, and by adding the constrain i*i=-1, we realize that we have extended our algebra by defining a more complex multiplication. (sorry if the terminology is not correct, I&#39;m just an engineer)<br>Now what I&#39;m wondering about is as follows: It should be possible by adding a dimension and preserving the 1D behaviour of the multiplication to build a generalized algebra by redifining addition no? But then in that case addition would have to be associated to rotation and translations since multiplication would only be squeezing. Is that possible? Sounds really weird at first glance, but I&#39;m sure the answer would provide insight to the constrains that we could physically ask of one algebra.<br><br>Edit: Obviously in that case the constrain would have to be something like i+i =&quot;something&quot;, which seems always possible within the real numbers for all possible &quot;somethings&quot;.  Thus we would not need rotations. Due to the very basic structure of the action of addition the only constrain that I can imagine of, which would require rotations would be: positive number + positive number = negative number. For example x+x= -2*x or prime1+prime2 = -sum. This seems way to twisted to be definable in a coherent way I guess or at least it wouldn&#39;t have a geometric meaning.

Seems to me that once you get a 2d group, you would have actions that applies to either axis plus rotation actions. <br><br>Thus for the additive group, you could have both x-axis and y-axis slides and rotations. Not that you&#39;d need all three but you could do any of those three, just like a 2d square can use rotations but can also do just flips. <br><br>Likewise, the multiplicative group could do an x-axis stretch and a y-axis stretch. Of course, you might immediately consider that stretching the y-axis would not move the points on the x-axis at all, at which point I ask why you look at a point of focus, the 1, only on the x-axis, when it makes far more sense that going to 2d multiplication would require a focus point of non-origin for both axi, logically, it&#39;d be x=1 and y=1. <br><br>Besides, once you go 2d, you realize that a number can be 2d, in which case the number is a line, or rather four of them. A 2d number is all points where the area of the rectangle defined by the point and the origin as opposite corners equals that number. So 4 in 2d is all points where the origin and the point as opposing corners of a rectangle has an area of 4. These points are infinite and all lay on a symmetrical line in each quadrant. The lines being asymptotic to the axi of the graph.<br><br>For ease of use, you could look at only the points where the rectangle is square, in which case you have a single point in each quadrant.  Either way, whether looking at just the point of being square or the whole line, just like how with 1d number line we pick just the positive number unless we specify it to be negative, likewise here, we can assume the ++ quadrant unless we specify one of the other three.

The Schrodinger equation is literally this, and Heisenberg&#39;s Uncertainty Principle uses the Fourier transform, which also makes use of complex exponentials to approximate functions. I didn&#39;t really understand the ideas behind complex exponentials, and I kinda just took it on faith that e^(ix) = cos(x) + isin(x). I did want to learn it eventually, but I could understand the physics principles pretty well without having to deeply understand complex exponentials. One I saw this video, I happened to decide to find the general form of what that particular transformation equals. When I saw that it equaled cos(x) + isin(x), I just couldn&#39;t stop laughing. I was legitimately giddy for several minutes, because of how amazing it is that group theory and symmetry  can show that we can&#39;t know the position and momentum of a particle exactly at the same time. The relationship between those seemingly incredibly disparate fields in math is so beautiful and profound, and I&#39;m so excited not that I figured out the general form (it was very trivial), but that I had the sense to wonder what that general form is, and that that question led me to finally understand something I had been wondering about for months.

In that case, the additive and multiplicative groups would converge to the same group.<br>In terms of such thinking one could also extend the real numbers beyond negative infinity by reversing this process, i.e. &quot;invent&quot; new numbers which will then be the logarithms of nonpositive real numbers, such as ln(0):=negative infinity...<br>Unfortunately, this could lead to problems with the extension to complex numbers, but I like the thought of real numbers as fractals.", "comment_date": "2017-03-03T23:02:19Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Jens de Vries", "comment_text": "It makes so much sense now.
