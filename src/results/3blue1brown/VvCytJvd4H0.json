[{"comment_by": "3Blue1Brown", "comment_text": "For the question at the end, the intended answer is not &quot;the handle lets you go in three dimensions&quot;, because for that matter a sphere is three-dimensional, but you could never solve it there.  Think about what makes the surface of the mug (or a doughnut) distinct from that of a sphere, and how <i>that</i> affects the argument.  I think I went years knowing that Euler&#39;s formula looks different on different surfaces but had never really thought through why.  In particular, the exercise will set good intuitions for learning about homology, if that&#39;s something in your future.<br><br>Also, my apologies for two names typos here: Veritasium, and James Grime (evidently I accidentally pluralized him to &quot;Grimes&quot;).  That&#39;s what I get for throwing on titles late at night, my bad!<br><br>To everyone saying &quot;I can&#39;t believe the math guys hadn&#39;t heard of this puzzle before&quot;.  I agree that would be surprising!  It&#39;s a very famous puzzle in math circles.  Maybe I accidentally obfuscated this too much in the editing, but all the math guys most certainly were familiar with the puzzle.  I mean, three of them make and sell the thing!  This is why their contributions were either direct explanations or jokes.

I originally thought &quot;well, it&#39;s because of the genus, duh&quot; and left it at that. The genus counts the number of holes in a space, informally. But what I realized looking back at it is that the argument presented in the video for the Euler characteristic relies on the fact that returning to a vertex MUST close a region. We can think of our surface as made of construction paper and the edges as cuts. Returning to the same vertex then corresponds to closing a loop, and closing a region corresponds to that loop making a removable piece of paper--it disconnects the space. On a genus 0 surface, this happens with any loop--any closed cut in our construction paper splits it into 2 pieces. But on a torus, and therefore on a mug, exactly one full loop can be made before the next cut disconnects it. Thus returning to a vertex (closing a loop) on a torus (or mug) does not necessarily correspond to closing a region (disconnecting the surface), so the argument fails. This is directly connected (no pun intended) to the formal definition of genus: the maximal number of closed loops that can be removed in a space without rendering it disconnected. However, I can&#39;t see how it directly relates to the Euler characteristic of the torus being zero (without resorting to 2 - 2g) from this argument.

I tried for hours at the time to find a way to solve it, before realising it was impossible. The game was coded so that every time 2 lines cross each other, every single line you&#39;ve drawn would disappear, but if you somehow managed to beat the thing, a victory screen would pop up. As a matter of fact, it was possible to beat it by exploiting tools at hand to trick the memory of the game into thinking you didn&#39;t release the click, and linked the last source to the last house, even tho it went straight through one of the other lines. The idea was to draw every line but the last one, making sure those never crossed, and then for the last one, hold the click, draw till you&#39;re realy close to the line you need to go through, and while holding the left click, press the right click so the window with options would pop up. Once it popped up, release the left click, and simply move your cursor to the last house, and click it. This method was the easiest, but didn&#39;t work consistently, so another method would have you clicking on the &quot;zoom in&quot; option in the right click pannel instead of going straight for the house. It tricked the computer more consistently, but this time the issue was that the zoom would sometimes move your cursor right into the line you were trying to go through (or sometimes another one), overlapping both lines, and resetting the game. It was pretty fun for me as a child to realise it was impossible, even tho I didnt understand the reason at the time, and it&#39;s realy cool to revisit this problem through this video.

In my solution I only have 3 regions and it actually looks like each region has every node at its border. So I think that is part of the solution. Also note that this checks out with the euler characteristic of the torus being 0, so with 6 nodes and 9 edges, we indeed expect 3 faces.<br><br>Like in the showcase following <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvCytJvd4H0&amp;t=7m40s\">7:40</a>, when we connect the bottom middle node to the top left node, if this was on the torus, we could go around one of the cycles of it. We then split the drawing area into two regions again, but actually due to the other ends of the torus being connected, they are one and the same surface! We can actually do the same trick once more going around the other cycle of the torus, again splitting the drawing area in half, while not really splitting that region into two. So basically for each cycle of the torus we get an &quot;out of jail&quot; card to draw an edge to a lit up node without enclosing a region. You can actually see this even easier, if you just consider one nodes on the torus, then you can connect it along the cycles and you just end up with one face overall. The euler characteristic then gives 1-2+1=0 as expected.<br><br>Another way you can make sense of it is also that those edges you draw are then not bordering two surfaces, but just one, so that also messes up with the way of counting we have employed earlier.<br><br>What is somehow really important here, is that if you draw a node corresponding to one cycle, it&#39;s the other cycle that allows this trick. So on a cylinder for example it doesn&#39;t work because you have only one cycle. The only edge you could draw there that would not resulting in a new face would be the one connecting both boundaries of the cylinder, so that doesn&#39;t really help us.", "comment_date": "2021-12-08T11:01:59Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "All Waizeright", "comment_text": "It&#39;s not - It&#39;s actually quite easy.", "comment_date": "2021-12-08T08:28:42Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "sorrow", "comment_text": "This is an easy puzzle", "comment_date": "2021-12-08T02:32:12Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Jane Ross", "comment_text": "Thankyou, just ordered one, will make a lovely christmas present!", "comment_date": "2021-12-07T04:07:14Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "The mighty eagle", "comment_text": "Did it, my hint, use the handle like a bridge<br><br>Edit: I did it without the handle, nice<br><br>Edit 2: forgot edit 1, I\u2019m a moron", "comment_date": "2021-12-07T00:08:55Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Defined", "comment_text": "Didnt watch the video, but if its the same puzzle as the thumbnail then its possible", "comment_date": "2021-12-06T19:41:39Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "VNIT [NAGPUR, MAHARASHTRA]", "comment_text": "Love from india", "comment_date": "2021-12-05T20:16:35Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "David Djuran", "comment_text": "I know it took me 3 years, but i solved it", "comment_date": "2021-12-02T13:53:57Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "fccgrnp", "comment_text": "I draw notes full with this stuff two decades ago <br>What means there are many actors, cuz they must have know the stuff since long time lol", "comment_date": "2021-11-30T06:57:25Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Bram Mestdagh", "comment_text": "This puzzle is possible on paper i do not get it how it is impossible", "comment_date": "2021-11-29T20:16:56Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "brin ds", "comment_text": "i figured it out on the first try its not impossible what??? its so easy", "comment_date": "2021-11-29T19:55:30Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Autistic game And watch", "comment_text": "Would the lines technically be crossing if you used the handle", "comment_date": "2021-11-29T18:28:22Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Starboii", "comment_text": "Vsause?", "comment_date": "2021-11-29T09:22:20Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Satyr jpg", "comment_text": "i was shown this puzzle when i was a kid and i spent years coming back to it and trying it and i\u2019ve always wanted a way to prove it was impossible. this is a everything i\u2019ve ever wanted in life.", "comment_date": "2021-11-29T03:01:56Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "xXJackirBlackBloddXx", "comment_text": "sadly it wont because i just realise a 1d line in a 3d plane can go around a fuckton of ways while on a 2d plane it closes places off", "comment_date": "2021-11-29T01:18:31Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Great Tesoros", "comment_text": "It&#39;s possible.. i solved it 1 min into the video.

If we incorporate the idea that the mug is a 3d shape or simply a sphere with a handle the answer becomes obvious.<br>For me it took 2 sheets of paper to figure it out. I stopped watching around the second chapter of the video to try it out myself cause I was curious. My solution was simple: make the mug a sphere. Instead of making the lines of each house( triangle) connect to the utility ( circle) nearest to them on the middle and take the long way around it would have the way to the answer. Then have the 2 outer triangles have lines that goes up within the outer lines so that they are now in-between the middle and outer triangles you can now connect them to the middle circle. Now that leaves the middle triangle unconnected to the outer circles, hense making use of the inside space. (Yes it is possible to make the middle triangle connect to the opposing circle immediately but it will make it harder visually on what we are trying to see.) Now because the 2 opposite sides of the triangle (houses) hasn&#39;t connected with the exact opposite side of the circles (utility) they would cross out (on paper do a diagonal line towards the corners of the paper) to the exact opposite side. <br>I realized after folding the paper into a cylinder multiple times that no matter what these last 2 lines will cross. Then I saw the handle of the mug and the rest is I the video.<br>I like the puzzle. Just commenting that it is interesting that it is possible to solve the problem just by emulating it on paper made it simpler to solve the &quot;impossible puzzle&quot;. It was fun even though this comment is 3 years late.

There are always two regions created which share three vertices (both numbers and a letter) and thus they share an edge. (in i. the shared edge is 1B2, in ii. it is 1A2, and in iii. it is 1C2) Notice that the letters that are vertices for only one of the regions are always found outside the region they are not a vertex of. Because these are the same outcome, we can rename the letters in each to unify them into one diagram.<br><br><br>            <i>_______________________</i>\r<br>            |                  x                   |\r<br>A  <i>___</i> 01 <i>____</i> B <i>_____</i> 02  <i>___</i> C\r<br> |                  y                  |\r<br> |_____________________|\r<br><br><br>STEP 3: Because they share an edge, the two regions (now labeled x and y) can also be thought of as one large shape (A1C2, or x+y). There are three shared vertices (1, B, and 2) and because B is between points 1 and point 2, B will always lie somewhere on the shared edge, and thus will be enclosed within the singular large shape x+y. If we temporarily restrict our focus to only x+y, the space is separated into two sections, within the x+y and outside of it. If two points are connected, they must both be within the shape or both be outside. The final vertex to add is 3, which will have to connect to B. B is contained within x+y, so 3 must also be inside x+y. Therefore point 3 will be in region x or region y. If we temporarily restrict our focus to only x, the space is separated into two sections, within x and outside of it. A is outside of x. 3 must connect to A. Therefore 3 is outside of x. If we temporarily restrict our focus to only y, the space is separated into two sections, within y and outside of it. C is outside of y. 3 must connect to C. Therefore 3 is outside of y.<br><br>So the conclusions we have drawn are:<br>   -   Point 3 must be inside either region x or region y<br>   -   Point 3 must not be inside region x.<br>   -   Point 3 must not be inside region y<br><br>Contradiction", "comment_date": "2021-02-22T08:08:40Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "C\u1edd R\u00edp T\u00f4ng", "comment_text": "Connect all ultilities to one houses and then connect 3 houses together.

That is not to say I do not believe it is likely a proof, it seems like it may well be, but I have no idea what the behavior you are trying to describe is as the explanation of that seems lost in the rampage to a derivation of Euler&#39;s formalism on the subject.

I might believe one over the other, but so long as you do not claim that the length of a day or any of the other facts of its existence are different, it does not matter to me.

If they differ by 0 it&#39;s trivial and if they differ by 2 we can let S3 act on the element by exchanging the two places that differ so the orbit of the g is precisely the set of all states with an odd number of gold sides.", "comment_date": "2018-02-28T00:42:17Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "NetAndyCz", "comment_text": "<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvCytJvd4H0&amp;t=15m04s\">15:04</a> lol:D:D", "comment_date": "2018-02-27T22:25:27Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "NetAndyCz", "comment_text": "You got some really superb YouTubers for this one!", "comment_date": "2018-02-27T22:14:28Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Necron3145", "comment_text": "There are (V-E+F) types of viewers<br><br>n i c e .<br><br>btw for the &quot;homework&quot; you gave, the handle is basically a bridge, which allows lines to cross over once (basically giving you one mercy for crossing), and it breaks your proof by allowing a new edge to be connected to an old vertex without creating new region, so it&#39;s no longer an &quot;either or&quot; situation", "comment_date": "2018-02-25T15:16:49Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Saptarshi Sarkar", "comment_text": "Where can I buy a cup like this?", "comment_date": "2018-02-25T09:03:24Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "yuyurtrtrt2", "comment_text": "WAIT A MINUTE THIS IS JUST FLOW BRIDGES!!!", "comment_date": "2018-02-22T05:22:58Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Pranav Garg", "comment_text": "My answer to that question over the end was that 4 points, that enclosed a whole region in a plane like you explained in the vid, does not in the torus.

Can you solve it on a (mathematical) M\u00f6bius strip? ;)<br><br>P.S. By a mathematical M\u00f6bius strip I mean a mathematically thin one where points on both &quot;sides&quot; are actually considered to be the same points. For many properties of M\u00f6bius strips it doesn&#39;t matter if you make it out of paper and travel on the surface of the paper (a physical M\u00f6bius strip), or if you consider the mathematical version, which would correspond to traveling <b>inside</b> the paper; but for the posed puzzle it matters profoundly. Specifically, you have to circle the physical M\u00f6bius strip &quot;twice&quot; to return to the starting point, i.e. the curve on the surface has to sweep out 720 degrees in 3D space to return to the starting point (because after 360 degrees you end up on the other side of the paper from where you started), whereas the mathematical M\u00f6bius strip has to be circled only once to return to the starting point (i.e. after 360 degrees in 3D space you are back to where you started, and you didn&#39;t end up on the other side of the paper - you were inside the paper from the get go).<br><br>So, to attempt the puzzle: glue yourself a real physical M\u00f6bius strip out of paper, but allow yourself to tunnel through the thin sheet of paper to its opposite side at any point (or points) you wish to (this is equivalent to being on a mathematical M\u00f6bius strip). Happy puzzle solving! ;)<br><br>P.P.S. Extra extra: could you solve it on a physical M\u00f6bius strip without tunneling?

We first need to think away of the vertices and only think of connected edges.<br>On a flat plane or a sphere, creating a connected edge means creating a new plane. On a torus, however, this isn&#39;t always the case. If you create a new edge without using the hole i.e. the edge neither go around nor through the hole, you get a new plane.<br>However, once you incoorperate the hole (e.g. going around or through the hole), this doesn&#39;t work properly. You only get a new plane if you already have an edge if you add another edge of the same kind.<br><br>That means, we have three kinds when you create a connected edge:<br>- It goes around the hole (edge A)<br>- It goes through the hole (edge B)<br>- Neither of the above (edge C)<br>This gets even more complicated since edge A and B don&#39;t really affect each other. This means, if the torus already has got an edge A. This means, if you don&#39;t use edge C then the amount of planes you get is A * B unless the result zero in which case it counts as one.<br><br>This anomaly allows you to solve the puzzle. One edge has to go around the hole (or in this case, use the cup&#39;s handle as a bridge), some others through the hole/ handle and the rest don&#39;t go near the hole/ handle.<br><br>A similar problem occurs on a 2D Torus, a circular plane with a hole in the center. If you make an edge which doesn&#39;t touch both, the outer and inner edge at the same time (i.e. edge A or C on a torus), you always get a new plane. However, if the edge question touches both already existing edges, all you have done is to add an edge without getting a new one (as long, as you don&#39;t touch an edge C or there already exist a such edge, that&#39;s it).<br><br>I mean, this isn&#39;t the full explaination but I have feeling, it goes into that direction.", "comment_date": "2017-12-24T10:13:06Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "yfev", "comment_text": "wut i think i just solved it on paper(well, on paint actually)... probably i made a mistake somewhere.", "comment_date": "2017-12-24T10:01:45Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "PlaystationMasterPS3", "comment_text": "this is clever.  recognized it as the three utilities problem, but thought it was impossible, until I realized that the mug is topologically a funny shaped torus. you need at least one hole to solve it since k[3,3] isn&#39;t planar, so any solution on the mug must use that handle to good effect", "comment_date": "2017-12-24T10:01:23Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "multi misa", "comment_text": "Yeah..in 3d it&#39;s no problem..so that&#39;s where the rule breaks down?", "comment_date": "2017-12-24T09:57:42Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Doomy", "comment_text": "Nice.

Then you can run a second edge the rest of the way around the torus back to the already-lit original vertex. This is where you&#39;d pick a side of the edge you just drew and start painting in your region on a plane, but on a torus you&#39;d find that by following the paint through the hole, you come straight to the other side of your edge. So both sides of the equator are the same color, and the same region, i.e., we have the same number of regions (1) that we started with. This means that, unlike a plane (@<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvCytJvd4H0&amp;t=11m20s\">11:20</a>),  a torus allows you to add a new edge WITHOUT adding a vertex or creating a new region. <br><br>In particular, this means that we don&#39;t have to try to use our guaranteed 9 edges to try to make a whole 5 regions. In other words, the number of regions will be 4 at the most. So, by the same logic in the video, 4 regions with 4 edges each (@<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvCytJvd4H0&amp;t=9m50s\">9:50</a>) means 16 edges, and since this tally double-counts the edges (@<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvCytJvd4H0&amp;t=10m35s\">10:35</a>), we only need 8 edges (at the most), so we have 1 to spare!

So every time you draw a line across a torus, going through vertices in a way that makes you return to your original location (creating a &quot;region&quot;) you are actually creating <b>two</b> regions by splitting your finite area in two parts.
