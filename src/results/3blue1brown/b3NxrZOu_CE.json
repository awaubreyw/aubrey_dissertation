However, <b>none</b> of the Hamming Codes are  blocks of data+parity that are powers of 2.  This is apparent briefly when the narrator mentions the (7,4) Hamming Code; the 7 refers to the size of the block, and the 4 refers to the amount of data.  The next larger Hamming Code is (15,11).<br><br>The narrator also glosses over the reasonable question, &quot;what if one of the parity bits is where the error occurs?&quot;<br><br>The best thing in the video was the brief hint about the Hamming Distance, which really does explain how this all works, including the Reed-Solomon codes,.<br><br>------<br><br>It&#39;s also worth pointing out that block codes (e.g. Hamming, Reed Solomon) are only half of the universe of error correction; the other half are the convolutional codes.", "comment_date": "2021-08-30T05:35:26Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Florian Sommer", "comment_text": "Danke!", "comment_date": "2021-08-27T01:39:50Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Jesin", "comment_text": "This was great.

What is obvious to one person might be agonizingly, obliviously unobvious to another, and vice versa. Honestly, when I watched Matt&#39;s video, the idea of splitting the chess board into binary sections seemed completely intuitive, especially because it was involving coin flips (binary) and a chess board (an eight by eight square). It&#39;s more like the quote you point out. Luck favours a prepared mind. So does obviousness. The idea of something being obvious or not is a lot more dependent on context, which can change. It seems obvious now because it <i>is</i> obvious now. It wasn&#39;t then. It isn&#39;t that it fundamentally &quot;is&quot; or &quot;isn&#39;t&quot; obvious, because, really, it&#39;s the same with all mathematics. Negative numbers weren&#39;t always obvious. The concept of 0 wasn&#39;t always obvious. What&#39;s obvious is based on a changing context of collective conception of mathematical ideas. It&#39;s that the collective conception of these types of ideas has grown in humanity, and, <i>now,</i> these concepts <i>are</i> obvious. That doesn&#39;t mean that we can&#39;t appreciate and recognize that they weren&#39;t then, because the ways of conceptualizing these mathematical notions hadn&#39;t been as thoroughly explored and codified. Which is all to say that, personally, I think it&#39;s important and beautiful to recognize how and why that it <i>is</i> obvious, <i>now,</i> rather than to say people are tricking themselves into thinking they&#39;re obvious. Nobody is tricking themselves into thinking that the idea of the number 0 is obvious. I mean, the notion of obviousness isn&#39;t a finite feature of reality. It is certainly obvious now. The fact these ideas now are more intuitively apparent shows a change to humanity&#39;s conceptualization of deeper mathematical ideas that&#39;s worth knowing is has happened. It means the appreciation for these ideas has grown and changed <i>to where</i> they can be more obvious, because the backdrop of understanding has developed. It can simultaneously be true that these ideas are now obvious, and that they weren&#39;t before, and that they remain brilliant innovations. I think it&#39;s wonderful that people are now afforded an intuition of these ideas by the foundation of brilliant innovations that changed how we think of mathematics. It doesn&#39;t really mean people are thinking that these ideas are simpler than they really are. I mean, I think it&#39;s really beautiful that understanding <i>has</i> grown and changed that much for the better.", "comment_date": "2020-09-05T00:49:26Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "The Bard", "comment_text": "I can&#39;t help but hear &quot;parody&quot; when he says &quot;parity&quot;", "comment_date": "2020-09-05T00:47:48Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Alex Koz", "comment_text": "I don&#39;t know if I could love a video more.

You can&#39;t really fix laziness, after all it has lead to a lot of problem solving in its own right.  But the fear of being wrong, I am willing to bet you can at least help.  This fear can stem from a lot of internal problems but this doesn&#39;t stop us, we just make it easier when the student is wrong.  We still have to say whether they are wrong or right, but really look at the reasoning behind their solution to a problem.  Hence why, as much as it pains the average student, story problems/open ended math problems are probably the best kinds of teaching points.
