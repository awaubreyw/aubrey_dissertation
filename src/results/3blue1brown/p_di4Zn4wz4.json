[{"comment_by": "3Blue1Brown", "comment_text": "Some notes on the intended use of this series.  I was deliberate in using the phrase &quot;tour of differential equations&quot;, as opposed to &quot;introduction to&quot; or &quot;essence of&quot;.  I think of the relationship between watching this series and taking a course as being analogous to the relationship between touring a city vs. living in it.  You&#39;ll certainly see a lot less with the tour since you&#39;re spending less time overall, but the goal will be to walk around some of the most noteworthy monuments and town centers with helpful context given to you by a guide.  And just as someone who lives in a city may very well have never gone to visit some of the historical sites of their town, despite living there for years, many differential equations students may not always get the chance to zoom out and appreciate the central cornerstones of the subject amidst all the computations they are learning.<br><br><br>I hope you enjoy the tour, but at the same time know that it is, by design, very different from taking courses on the subject.", "comment_date": "2019-08-30T17:56:33Z", "likes_count": 2253}, {"comment_by": "Briitch", "comment_text": "god, i love this channel.", "comment_date": "2022-08-28T22:02:33Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Ryan Neuman", "comment_text": "phase space makes me happy :^)", "comment_date": "2022-08-16T08:11:31Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "El_Glu", "comment_text": "This is exactly how math should be taught", "comment_date": "2022-08-15T21:45:36Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "El_Glu", "comment_text": "This man literally just derived all of introductory kinematics in under a minute lol", "comment_date": "2022-08-15T21:11:56Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Sanubar Taskeen Khan", "comment_text": "Your efforts are undifined...!!!!!!!\ud83c\udf3c\ud83d\udc9c", "comment_date": "2022-08-11T09:42:47Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Saul Rayon", "comment_text": "waooo", "comment_date": "2022-08-11T02:36:57Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "\u0410\u043b\u0438\u0445\u0430\u043d \u0420\u044b\u0441\u043a\u0435\u043b\u044c\u0434\u0438\u043d", "comment_text": "\u0436\u0434\u0451\u043c \u043f\u0435\u0440\u0435\u0432\u043e\u0434 \u043d\u0430 \u0440\u0443\u0441\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0439\ud83d\ude34", "comment_date": "2022-08-04T14:59:58Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Aryan Neel", "comment_text": "Thank you for everything.

I add the thing which realized it by the imagination of own brains and convey the truth. The world moves for the will of God and the devil. God let the world employ a saint in order to tell the will of God to a human being. It is Prince Shotoku and is Christ, Buddha. The picture that they were shown in meditation is our future event. The future is never fixed, but, in the domain that I can change in human beings, is accomplished a prophecy street of God small. For a before the fact period, I am listed in the Apocalypse in cipher. <br><br>  The flood of Noah is a true story, and we are the survivors. The judgment of God is strict. God finally cuts maximum permissible level, and the ogre of the obstacle of the heaven establishment is exterminated. There is the story by the act of the angel listed in the Apocalypse. <br><br>\u203bOnly the earth is the material world, and 1m or more above the ground are God world. Therefore the alien does not exist because space is a spiritual world.  The moon is the soul health, but becomes the material when a human being is going to touch it. The soul body becomes the material in God and a human conception. The evidence that it is the soul body that changes color in a red color such as the yellow pale blood that the moon is white as for the evidence. Because the principle of constancy of light velocity of Einstein is a lie, and the light is the soul health, I move to an end of the space at a moment. This is because a material makes that a human being <br><br>\u203bThe most stupid one is a scholar of winning the Nobel Prize, and the first genius is Prince Shotoku of the medium of the wisdom that excelled in intuitive power.<br><br> We are delivered from it from brainwashing of the science (mathematics, physics) got by a lie, and let&#39;s regain true study in our hand. <br> <br>The science is the fiction which I made because the devil denies God, and what is listed in a Japanese old legend and the Christian Bible is true. A stupid scholar all overturned this truth and built it to a convenient system of Mason. Thus, the people believe the trickery of the devil than words of God. Darwin&#39;s evolutionary theory, the Copernican theory of Galileo, the theory of relativity, quantum mechanics, mathematics, the medicine of Einstein are all errors. A ghost, a UFO, supernatural power, the miracle of God to be said to be the occult are rather true. A thing and a ghost (God) exist in the world, and space is active by spiritual power (conception) of God. As for God, all things were created by the soul of language. It is clear if I read the Bible. Because the present scholar mixes the logic thoroughly in human wisdom, it cannot arrive at the truth. It is intuitive power to be important. Why does a child seem to be? The thing which cannot answer this is a mistake. Our common sense is more right than a stupid scholar. The creation of God comes loose only by a fate. Everything becomes the material by a conception of God (person).<br> <br>I cannot prove 1+1 = 2 in a numerical formula. I can prove only a physical phenomenon to say that it is in two apples when I match another one apple with one apple. It is not 0+1 \u2260 1. As 0 (nothing) is not quality, you must not handle it for a number. Because quality is different even if I match a mandarin orange with an apple, there is not a meaning of the addition. Because it does not exist other than God when I define God as existence, no (0) does not exist. Because the mathematics defines 0, negative number, imaginary number, \u221e which do not exist in the world, it is an error and is a fiction. A number is to count quality. When I am separated from a physical phenomenon, the mathematics does not have the significance of being.<br><br>\u203bIf 0 exists by a definition of the mathematics, 0 of the infinity must exist. However, the infinite space, infinity do not exist. In other words, because the mathematics defines 0, negative number, imaginary number, \u221e which do not exist, it is an error and is a fiction. Therefore it is an error because a zeta function, the numerical formula of the second oiler product deal with this infinity. That it becomes sum of series \u03a3 = 1+2+3+ ... = - 1/12 of the natural number, or the product of all prime numbers is 4\u03c0^2. It turns out that it is an error if I think for common sense. It is limited, and the mathematician seems to get a wrong this, but uses the sophism when I calculate this endlessly if right. This is a mistake of the definition of 0 or \u221e and is the evidence that mathematics gets a wrong. It is definition f&#39;(x) = limh of the differential calculus that must not divide it by 0 \u2192 0 {the same as it being 0 that says that I bring h close to 0 without a limit, and dividing it by a numerical formula of f(x+h)-f(x)}/h. I divide it by 0. The mathematics is trickery not study in this way.<br><br> All the origins of the scientific theory are random, and a bottom is broken. For example, in the theory of elementary particles, an electron joins atoms together and becomes the molecules. A thing joining a proton and a neutron together is a mesotron, and three quarks connect the proton, and there is it. An electron and a positron (antimatter) occur from a photon. An elementary particle to tie the elementary particle to whenever a new elementary particle is discovered is necessary and loses the relations with an elementary particle and the elementary particle more and more. Though a proton and the neutron are the same mass, why does a difference occur in having electric charge or not? The science has no answer with it in these questions. An electron is a material so that I think, and the positron is not a material in the hole of the material loss that the circumference was surrounded by in the soul children. In other words, the antimatter is an illusion. The scholar is going to examine it logically and loses sight of the truth. The structure of built nature of God is simpler, but is the thing which it is hard to understand in the human wisdom. A photon seems to have a particle and the two characteristics of the wave, but, in fact, the light has the property of the wave with the soul body.<br><br> Message from the spiritual world of Einstein <br> When oneself saw a scene of heaven through a tunnel of the light in the meantime, the person who experienced suspended animation well is you after the revival. The moving speed of the soul does not receive gravitational restraint anymore, and, as for the law of the speed of light immutability that I discovered during the lifetime, there are none in the world of the consciousness. In other words, I will say that it just moves to say that I think. Furthermore, it is just handed down to a partner to have thought. The life of all of us shares what one interiority. And the material is to say that it was actually consciousness. There are all things in your heart, and, also, you are existence to live in a heart of all life. When all of this space watches it with eyes, it is seen like the outside world, but is to say that the world to be actually seen outside is your interiority. The relativity disappears in here, and this space consists based on &quot;universal truth to certainly say to call God&quot;. <br><br> Near future to read from revelation and illuminati card of God of days, and to untie it in Japan<br> April, 2020 xx day The United States bombs North Korea. North Korea adds nuclear attack to a big city of Japan and a U.S. base as the retaliation. Japan swats it to a bog of the war, and they are dropped by a plot of the United States. There are China, Russia after North Korea and becomes the fight with Japan, American allied powers and drags the world into World War 3.<br> x moon xx Japan and the United States country attacks it in Japan with the Allied Forces in 2021<br> World War 3 begins in 2021 on xx moon xx day<br> Mount Fuji erupts very much on xx day in October, 2023. Major earthquakes occur in a row in all parts of the world. <br> An asteroid collides on the earth on xx moon xx day in 2023, and the earth becomes muddy sea <br> The world (heaven) of the Maitreya is built on xx moon xx day in 2024<br><br> Final note<br> The human being denies violence and war, but is it not violence and killing each other I kill a cow pig, and to eat meat? I conquer the world in the life of the hell of the cruel survival of the fittest and am useless even if only oneself is going to be saved. Because a killed animal retaliates for a human being, cancer occurs. The meat which I ate becomes the blood, and a vindictive spirit dwells in a cell when blood does formation to a cell. A human being is cruel, and a fornication, a falsehood, committing theft, the habit of the evil deed of the luxury are not stopped. Eating meat is indirect killing. Why is God that existence of the evil is permitted? It lets you compensate for a human crime by the devil. A disaster, an epidemic, the war damage are the wrath of Heaven. Because a Japanese savior buys the crime of the world people, it is sacrificed. I fall in the trees and plants in spite of the pains then even if I writhe with a hell if it is just and changes the heart and does not straighten an act to measure up to hearts of God. Mason finally leads the world to the World War 3. it is started with nuclear attack to Japan as a pilot light.

So a line segment connecting them through them will have angles that total 180 degrees, just like in a parallelogram.* (You rotate one way, then rotate back around). The cyan vector a tangent line to the circle (due to physics), making a right angle, or 90 degrees from L.

I realised that I could find acceleration at every angle on the pendulum&#39;s path, but I couldn&#39;t translate that equation into one for position/amplitude over time. I struggled for days and says with identifying if and how acceleration as a function of time could be derived from acceleration a function of position, for a changing acceleration (kinematics equations couldn&#39;t be applied, under the basis that the acceleration was not constant).<br><br>Can somebody please explain to me an intuitive approach to getting from a(p) to a(t), or v(p) to v(t)? In other words, if we know the velocity or acceleration at each physical position on a journey, how do we create a function/relationship that represents at what time that physical position was passed? It feels like there must be a really simple answer, but nobody will tell me.<br><br>I think I&#39;m struggling with the concept that time is a dimension rather than just a variable and I feel like I&#39;m messing with scale every time I manipulate the formula.

You dont explain how you can graph the  phase space just from the ODE. Please can someone explain this? All I see is that he got the exact analytical solution from somewhere and used that to produce his phase space (vector field?). But then I ask how can one produce the vector field without the analytical solution? Becuase later in the video he says that sometimes it&#39;s not possible to get an analytical solution. In which case, how can he just skip to drawing the vector field??

It is because fundamentally, a constant is already an equation, and should be \u201cunsimplified\u201d.. it\u2019s like Pi, slowing down the progression of measuring arbitrary curves or perimeters of ellipses. When you\u2019re dealing with constants, it\u2019s important to note that very likely, you will enter a \u201czone\u201d where for a little while, your calculations will stray and become less accurate for abit. Just like how in one of the latter examples in the video, the pendulum orbited more than once before it started swinging  and fell into another \u201ccyclone\u201d further away, that is because the initial force surpassed a \u201cthreshold\u201d.. A good example of this is the golden ratio, it is \u201cnumber 1\u201d on 2 different basic scales.. and that constant appears in many other scales as well.. the 1/x scale (metallic ratios) so it moves by 1 when u 1/x... (silver ratio, square root of 2 + 1, moves by 2 when u 1/x.) And then you have  the x^2 (squared) scale,. the problem lies that it\u2019s on 2 scales, but also that it\u2019s part of the squared ladder.. meaning when you\u2019re computing if ever you fall close to an opposing root it will \u201cstray\u201d u away for a little while... the second number on the squared ladder is 2 , but also -1.. because both squared add \u201cplus 2\u201d to the answer.

But infinity can also be a word, a word, a name such as YouTube or private signal television channels or it can also be a geometric figure whose surface is not Infinite since there IS a specific mathematical formula to be able to calculate and solve it. The Infinite does NOT exist, what happens in some cases is that it becomes UNDETERMINED due to lack of advanced science and technology. Previously they said that the universe or space was Infinite currently in our Human Evolution with the &quot;aerospace science and technology = Satellites, space telescopes such as hubble, kepler, etc and more etc&quot; from the 21st century we have determined that the universe is not Infinite and it has a size limit and a time limit and is no longer indeterminate but it was never Infinite. We have already quantified the size of the sun and how many years of life it has left previously, they said that the sun is infinitely eternal and it is demonstrable that it is totally false. And I am only exposing 2 cases &quot;macros = large size&quot; of supposedly infinite real life, but there are also millions of cases &quot;micros = microscopic size&quot; that were believed to be infinite but are not and are already determinable as is the case of the atom. And as the human being evolves, everything becomes determinable and useful for the human being. Saying it is Infinite is a BANAL quick fix when something that is not understood or cannot be determined. And to give a single mathematical example, you have 8 chocolates squared and you have no woman to give it to consequently you still have your 64 chocolates that you will end up eating by yourself and your 64 chocolates WILL NOT BE INFINITE since they will run out when you eat them all. Another example would be if you do not have anything and you are going to divide it by nothing or no one does not believe that you will have something INFINITE, the answer would be simply &quot;NOTHING&quot;, so use Logic to solve any scientific or everyday calculation. We must rewrite or re-edit most of our calculations, theorems, or mathematical, physical, chemical principles, etc. based on the data of the scientific and technological advances of our 21st century. It is NO longer justified and stop being stupid or mediocre in our studies and professionalism and continue to apply the word Infinite obsolete or in a banal way when we do not understand something or we cannot solve it quickly and if you do not believe me, apply those equations or mathematical calculations to real domestic, scientific, aerospace, industrial, military life, medical, chemical, physical, etc and more etc. If the value of the INFINITE were applied to the construction of a huge and long bridge or a huge skyscraper a while ago they could not even have started their construction since nothing infinite can be left and its true applied meaning of Infinity would be &quot;indeterminable&quot;, since its construction is made on the basis of calculations with certainty, known, determinable or firm. Numbers were born with the need for human beings to express and order themselves and thus be able to evolve and the four basic rules of mathematics that we all know which are addition or summation (+), subtraction (-), multiplication (*) and division (/) of them always derive or support all the more advanced or complex calculations &quot;such as derivatives, integrals, limits, matrices, logarithms, potentiation, factorization, roots or rationalization, etc&quot; and are easily misapplied with the word INFINITE and on 07/15/1969 the human being could not have reached the moon leaving mathematical, physical, chemical calculations, etc. wrong applying Infinity to them for their prompt or quick resolution.

It is the simplest system showing all forms of chaos, because it has a 3-dimensional phase space, the phase of the sinusoidal driving force being the third dimension. It is topologically easy to see that a two dimensional phase space does not allow chaos, because the phase trajectory must escape intersecting itself and therefore can only spiral in, eventually, when it has a damping term. The damped driven pendulum has an exponentially contracting phase flow, but it settles on a strange attractor that has it moving in a never repeating but also never stopping bounded motion: a great definition of chaos.

I&#39;m in a sort of love-triangle with two other guys, and our dynamics are.. complicated. Previously I lacked the language to describe the strange patterns by which our shared affections increase and decrease, but now I&#39;ve gained a little insight. It&#39;s a little like three planets orbiting each other; the magnitude and direction of my feelings for one person are affected by the connection they have with the other person. There&#39;s this emotion that&#39;s kinda the polar opposite of jealousy; like a shared happiness, the pleasure you experience when you recognize something good existing between two other people. I always thought it was wacky that this feeling could coexist, or at least cycle somehow, with a completely opposite reaction; the neglect and exclusion that you get when you observe a seemingly stronger connection between two other people, than you personally have with either of them. But now I feel like I grasp the shape of this relationship; it&#39;s like a phase space, where the tendency of your reaction towards either supportiveness or jealousy is just another axis. At any give point in time, one of us generally has a radically different value with regard to this tendency, while the other two generally have more similar values. Rarely, however, we all match up. It seems correlated some compound variable, related to the amount of affection and time spent together, of each pairing out of the three of us. It&#39;s FASCINATING. Thank you so much for this video ~ I&#39;ve been considering majoring in Psychology, but now I think I&#39;m going to dual-major in psych and math. Who knows?

I just wanted to give an advice to anyone aspiring to learn all this stuff. What they often teach you at school/uni is how to solve these equations analytically : sure, this is sometimes useful. However, in most real applications, it&#39;s more productive to be able to write a program to solve them rather than to do that &quot;manually&quot;. Even the simplest explicit solver that&#39;s literally 2 lines of code, instantly covers 95% of all differential equations, even though its performance and accuracy are not the best. It&#39;s kind of a brute force solution.<br><br><br>One might even start thinking that &quot;hey, if my computer can just solve all these equations, why even bother studying them?&quot;. And the reason is very simple: by applying knowledge of certain types of DE&#39;s and by using more advanced solvers, one can increase performance and accuracy of these solvers by orders of magnitude. Which might make a huge difference: physics simulation in your game becomes more stable, your rendering algorithm can run your effects 60fps instead of 5fps, you can render your image in higher resolution on the same hardware, etc. My idea is, don&#39;t think of your computer as a replacement for your knowledge.

Synchronization of the state space to the physical system means the the state space model now acts as a Kalman filter and the synchronization through a classic control loop keeps the state space model always in convergence with the physical system.

Additionally, the blue and purple vectors form a right angle. Therefore, the new position of the string is parallel to the purple vector (Converse of Alternate Interior Angle Theorem). By the Alternate Interior Angle Theorem, if we extend the yellow vector indefinitely, the angle it makes with the string facing upwards is theta.
