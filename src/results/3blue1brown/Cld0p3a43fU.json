Any movement, even the apparently more straight movement, is at some point a sinusoid or imply some sinusoidal behavior. Think about an extremely smooth cube sliding on an extremely smooth cliff. Macroscopically the cube looks simply sliding straight down the cliff, but if we look closer we&#39;ll notice that the friction between the microscopical asperities of their respective surfaces will cause the cube to microscopically bounce up and down. This fact plus the forward moving, it&#39;s exactly what a sinusoid is. Furthermore, that exactly coincides, obviously perhaps, with the sound the event will produce on its happening.<br>If it&#39;s true the Nature choose always the optimum path, the sinusoid path is the best path, it&#39;s the Brachistochrone. Anyway:<br>Observing free waves such light, we can trivially say that they doesn&#39;t slide trough any surface: they are themselves the sinusoidal movement they make.<br>Thus, the perfect sinusoidal movement it&#39;s not the movement of a ball through a sinusoidal sliding path, but the movement of an oval through a curve of undefined eccentricity. <br>A wave it&#39;s not strictly an object, thus the important it&#39;s not the movement of the object itself, but the movement the object barycenter will make on its way down, since a barycenter is an immaterial energetic body same as waves are. <br>So, if the object barycenter draw a sine of amplitude bigger or smaller then the amplitude of the curve-cliff, intended as period of a bigger wave, the velocity of the object will be slower or faster.<br>The movement of a ball rolling through a cycloid it&#39;s a specific case of the upper generalization: it&#39;s the case of barycenter sine movement with amplitude limiting to zero. <br>I suppose then the only way to do it faster its the case of an oval body whose barycenter sine amplitude shrink from &quot;1&quot; to 0 during its way without losing mass, rising thus it&#39;s own momentum. That&#39;s would be probably the case of an oval spool losing its thread behind or better perhaps, the case of a malleable oval which gradually shifts to a circle shape on its way down.<br>Thank you for the video, very interesting!", "comment_date": "2022-02-16T15:36:31Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "emmanuel carretero", "comment_text": "What a brilliant solution converting the problem like that \ud83d\udc4d", "comment_date": "2022-02-11T08:32:59Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "miklevideo", "comment_text": "La estrategia com\u00fan es dividir en partes peque\u00f1as algo grande para lograrlo, la fuerza que nos desencadena el peque\u00f1o logro nos da impulso para el siguiente.

I think the same approach can be used to solve the last problem you gave. To prove the angle theta increases uniformly in time, I considered the angular speed w (time derivative of theta) and used it to express the speed of point P: since the point C is the instantaneous center of rotation, the speed of P equals w times the length of CP, so v=w*D*sin(theta). At the same time, v is proportional to the square root of y, which in turn is proportional to the sine of theta, as you showed. So we have w*D*sin(theta)=k*sin(theta) for some constant k.

Acknowledging that the time-minimizing trajectory is linear in the theta-t space, one of the big implications is that angular velocity is constant. BIG. Another property to consider is that, as was mentioned previously in the video, energy is proportionate to the square of velocity, or in most differential cases acceleration. If theta-t is linear, the theta-dot is constant, this means that there is no rotational acceleration being imparted on the system and all of the energy gained from gravity can be focused on tangential velocity, which is what gets us from point a to point b. In this way, like removing friction from a system, we are  removing rotational acceleration from the energy equation thus increasing our tangential velocity and, given a path of constant length, this allows us to arrive at the destination the quickest. <br><br>Note, I think I&#39;ve been saying tangential through this, I guess what I mean more is cartesian.

If the left point is the same height as the right point, anything rolling down from left to right does not reach the right tip as the weight of the thing rolling down is controlled by gravity and immediately pulls it down upon reaching bottom dead center. If the object rolling down is weightless it will not roll down any faster and it will not roll up at the right any faster either. Gravity is intense by mass. On Earth, this is the gravity mass we have, but on the Moon the gravity is less intense and this explains a different story if we had the Moon&#39;s gravity. And, again this would be a different subject if we were on Jupiter which it could have a heavier gravity. That, we don&#39;t know for sure the gravity intensity, may make you feel heavier, but to what extent? A steel ball rolling from right to left in an even level of drop may roll faster than a glass ball, but not as fast as a Lead ball. If one end is lower than the starting end, then of course that doesn&#39;t chance anything and any balls of same size but different weight will roll out of it, no matter in what planet you are. So, this entire experiment is a waste of time. Any planet, no matter what size, material or composition they are, vary in gravity. Jupiter for example, i.e. its size and unknown composition may have a very strong gravitational pull to an extent and power we never knew but was thought to be stronger after we spotted a comet (Shoemaker - Levy 9) impacted with Jupiter, which demonstrate the power of gravity pull this planet has for its size. Shall we talk about the Sun and other giant heavenly bodies? Here on Earth it has been known for a long time about matters and its weight is recognised as gravity being equal down pull at both start and finish. But the weight of an object cause it to roll faster downhill than uphill, and when returning back to the start, it reduces the full climb back up and back again where it rolled before,  until it stops at the bottom center. That&#39;s gravity assisted in this way because of the gravity intensity of this planet.

Xdot/thetadot must be constant for the wheel to have constant radius and the linear relationship between theta and time. From the previous solution, this relationship would imply that y=D-xdot/thetadot or dx/dtheta=y-D. There is a couple of interesting things I noticed about dx/dtheta=y-D. First, at t=0, D is essentially infinite and y=0, which means that 0-infinity=costant (weird), which is probably a boundry issue. Second, at the highest velocity in the curve, y=D and dx/dtheta=0.

An object characterized by mass moves slower, an object characterized by energy moves faster. The mass-less move instantly with no perception of time. This would be equivalent to a cycloid with a diameter 0, and a path that spirals around throughout an imaginary plane. An outside perspective would observe a series of mass-less periodic motions propagating through some field. But while Information propagates at c as a waveform, time is relative to the frame of reference and size of the system, forming a scaling dipole moment.<br><br>I see no dissonance between general relativity and quantum mechanics. While photons are massless, their probability curve propagates through the field as a function, but so do low mass objects like electrons, and very high energy particles in accelerators. Their thing is, since they do have mass their speed may only approach the likes of a photon. To allow quantum mechanics to scale up from a particle coming into existence spontaneously, it would be an interesting thing to imagine. If you were to observe a circle of light in an infinite vacuum, you wouldn&#39;t know if it was a sphere or oblong, or maybe a collimated beam extending to infinity away from you. Of course, while this may be allowed by math, it only exists in a probability space until it is observed, which consequently compactifies the phenomenon into a finite but unbounded region - breaking one symmetry and creating another two. Unobserved however, it can only give you a frame of reference to go by. Our new particle may perceive this as opposing regions of positive and negative pressure. Positive pressure from the emission of photons, and negative pressure from the absorption of photons. Any more information to whittle down the actual shape of the light circle must come from outside its area. Likewise, any more information about ourselves if we&#39;re a newly born particle must come from outside ourselves, though we would perceive ourselves as changing due to inertia. From the outside, until we make contact with another light circle, our physical properties might as well be a veneer of probabilities.<br><br>It is possible to find that simply by defining a single bit of information as a frame of reference rather than a location, then absent any more information from outside (like observing the light circle) you can&#39;t have any concept of pressure, mass, or spin. Now if you pick a frame of reference large enough to encompass a wide variety of probabilistic expression from a moving object, many complete wavelengths can fit in the diameter of the reference frame, but you will also observe many more properties about the reference frame. And in this act of observing you compactify the probability space into a finite result based on the momentum from the previous interval.<br><br>The point of it all, is that by defining dimensions of information in a shape such that every unique bit of information is potentially its own frame of reference, a three dimensional object with every vertex observing 90 degree angles to all others creates a sphere. The pattern they form may take several different sized spheres and they all exist simultaneously as a probability until a fourth bit is offered to compare to them. If you understand classical time as the collapsing of potential superpositions of all the forms of energy in the universe across all reference frames, you must conclude also that time does not exist below the dimensions of information that define it, and the relationship between the dimensions defined previously does not exhibit time&#39;s spherical symmetry.", "comment_date": "2016-12-08T23:55:04Z", "likes_count": 2}, {"comment_by": "Ethan C", "comment_text": "awesome video, thanks!!", "comment_date": "2016-12-08T04:42:58Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "giacomo passetti", "comment_text": "thanks for what you&#39;re doing, your videos are awesome", "comment_date": "2016-12-07T17:18:28Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Andrew Kay", "comment_text": "Here&#39;s an interesting curiosity hidden in this explanation.<br><br>Light can change direction when it transitions between media of different densities.

The process is reversible so it should be symmetric under time. I&#39;m not sure the reason to start straight down is completely justifiable, but it&#39;s clear that once we determine the beginning and ending angles of motion, the shortest path in the configuration space from point (0,0) to (pi,t) is a straight line in that space.

My first instingt was to use calculus, but I didn\u00b4t do very good. However this is how far I came and if someone could help me to continue this calculation it would be really nice. <br><br>The variable that we want to minimize is the time, and the variable we are looking for is the function between the two points. So we need a relationship between the time and the function. We know that t=s/v, there is a general way to work out the distance between two points on a function. And it says that the distance from the point x=a to x=b on the curve f(x) is the integral from a to b of the function sqr(1+(f\u00b4(x))^2). The distance between the points doesn\u00b4t really matter so I\u00b4m going to say that it is one just to make things easier. This means that s=0integral1(sqr(1+(f\u00b4(x))^2))dx <br><br>We know that v=k*sqr(f(x)) in any given point, but since the speed changes over time we can not plug it in to the formula. Also I\u00b4m going to say k=1 just to make things easier. It won\u00b4t affect the final curve any way. Correct me if I am wrong but the average speed between x=0 and x=1 is going to be 0integral1(sqr(f(x)))dx.<br><br>So if we plug this into our formula t=s/v we get t=(0integral1(sqr(1+(f\u00b4(x))^2))dx)/(0integral1(sqr(f(x)))dx). So I have a formula for the relationship between the time and the function. Now I just have to find the derivative and set it equal to zero I guess, it will probably end up with i differential equation. There is just a little problem, I have no idea of how to take the derivative of that function, and I don\u00b4t even know if it is right for that matter. Is there even an algebraic way to do it? If not, then I have no idea about how to solve this problem algebraically.

Congratulations. I wish I had every math and physics class like this.<br>As for the first part of the challenge, I imagined that we can describe the movement of the particle from two different perspectives. Firstly, from a reference frame that would be moving horizontally along with the center of the circle that rotates under the horizontal line to form the cycloid. In this reference frame, the particle simply describes a portion of circle and the points A and B move horizontally. Well, if we suppose that this circle rotates at a constant speed, then the acceleration of the particle would obviously be pointing towards the center of the circle and  constant,  mv^2/(D/2), where v is relative to this reference frame. The second frame would be static relative to the cycloid curve. So, in this second frame, the particle would be subjected to its weight (mg) and the normal force (mv^2/r), where now, r=D sin(theta) is the instantaneous curvature radius. Well, it happens, that if we calculate the resulting force, taking the weight and the normal force that we observe in this second frame, considering the geometry and trigonometry, we will see that it is also constant, mg, and all the time pointing towards the circle center too. Since both frames would be inertial and the observed force could be the same if we choose a convenient angular speed omega for the circle, then we can say that the movement of the particle would be the same either if it describes a circle with constant rotational speed equals to sqrt(g/2D) or falls on a cycloid curve under gravitational force, mg.", "comment_date": "2016-04-14T21:59:00Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "William Kern", "comment_text": "::Likes video::<br>::Smashes monitor::", "comment_date": "2016-04-14T18:12:10Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Godot", "comment_text": "This sounds very similar to Feynman&#39;s path integral formulation of quantum mechanics, especially the angle being proportional to the time taken.
