I don&#39;t seem to go really far enough in the math, and get lost in all the symbols...  Ironically, the math I do use most often, I most often I have a fairly well developed concept visually of that mathematics, as it relates to physics, and that&#39;s as far as what I know goes... But, extending that, I find difficult nowadays, and though sources like Wikipedia are replete with, what I want, nay, need. Symbolic knowledge, and information, without the additional definitions of all the symbols and what they represent in those concepts, gets me I get lost... and at 63 years of age... I look back, and wistfully to the future, and just (sigh) oh to be in school again... pick up what I missed in math, I think, I could go so far in my physics.  Convert visuals, images, and concepts into the appropriate language I need... mathematics.  Mathematics can be so succinct, where words so verbose. I yearn for succinct.<br><br>That said, and the few videos I&#39;ve seen here... I say, YOU are the freakin genius.  I so look forward to mass consumption of your videos...  Thank you so much.  Theres still so much for me to learn... in fact, I&#39;ve forgotten more than I currently know.  But, what I retain is concepts, and as I age, I lose symbolic recollection, but concepts remain.  And, oddly enough, I manage to retain or regain the symbols, at least for fairly long periods of time, even after lost and regained.  So, I see a way for this old dog to still learn a few tricks...  My primary love is physics... and I&#39;ve always lacked the tools to express mathematically what I conceptually observe.  This is going to be a wonderful journey.
