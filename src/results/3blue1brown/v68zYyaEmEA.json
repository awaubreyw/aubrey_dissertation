A few follow-up questions come to mind as to how one could adapt this approach to some of my favorite wordle variants:<br><br>1) What if you&#39;re allowed to guess ANY five-letter string? Certainly some obscure, meaningless 5-letter combination should get you better results than, say CRATE or SALET, but with 26^5=11,881,376 allowed guesses you couldn&#39;t possibly brute-force that in a reasonable amount of time. Is there any efficient way to search for a 5-letter string which gets as close as possible to a uniform distribution, given a set of remaining possibilities and corresponding weights? And just how much of an advantage would this be?<br><br>2) Dordle: how can you adapt this approach to optimize two simultaneous wordles? Here&#39;s some of my thoughts:<br>- It&#39;s pretty reasonable to assume the two wordles are independently distributed (even though they&#39;re guaranteed to be distinct, the difference in results should be negligible). As a result, the expected information of the 2-wordle system can be very well-approximated by the sum of the two expected-infos. And the entropy of the 2-wordle system can be very well-approximated by the sum of the two entropies. In fact, by tracking the intersections of the two possibilities-sets, you should even be able to make this exact.<br>- Total entropy seems like a fair heuristic, but let&#39;s say I wanted to refine this to approximate expected remaining guesses like Grant does here. How could you derive some estimate for the expected score that takes into account the way entropy is split between the two wordles?<br>- The question then extends to n-ordles - for large n you&#39;ll probably start seeing a brief exploratory phase that can perhaps be optimized, followed by a series of guesses which are pretty much layups. I suspect the independence assumption would be optimal to avoid tracking large numbers of intersections. And perhaps an approach based on weighted averages of entropies might be appropriate as well.<br><br>If you&#39;re still reading this, lmk your thoughts. I&#39;m in the process of making a wordle-bot, and I&#39;m hoping to adapt it to also handle some of these variants.", "comment_date": "2022-06-08T17:45:55Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Dharlith", "comment_text": "<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v68zYyaEmEA&amp;t=1m45s\">1:45</a><br>benis :DDDDD", "comment_date": "2022-06-06T05:40:31Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Dark Warrior", "comment_text": "ok so I don&#39;t know wordle and most of my idea is on presumption that all English words are used<br>1 (creating a database for all words) download the English dictionary and write a program to identify all 5 letter words<br>2 (1st word) identify the average consonance to vowels <br>3 let&#39;s say the consonance to vowels is 3:2 so we get the 3 most common consonance and 2 most common vowels<br>4 identify if/all words with those 5 letters (if no words math, replace the least common of the 5 with something else, keep repeating until a word or more is found)<br>5 compare all selected words to the other  words, this is to see which word is most likely to have latters in the same position as others (you can technically just do this with ALL the words and find the best word, but that sounds like an impossibly long wait for the computer to process all that)<br>6 (Other word) depending on whether we are trying solve the puzzle as quickly as possible , we can start by choosing a word dependent on our previous word&#39;s results .Excluding certain words and following the same rules as for the first word, continuously until end<br>or <br>As accurately as possible, picking another word with the 4th ,5th, 6th most common consonance and 3rd, 4th most common vowels follow same process for the first word, for the 3rd and 4th words do the same or similar to the 2nd but with the correct letters in the right place. for the 5th and 6th it would best to start picking words most likely to be the right one", "comment_date": "2022-06-05T15:21:47Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Valentina Karamazova", "comment_text": "I am a PhD student in astrophysics, using information theory to reconstruct the magnetic field of the Milky Way.

Have you ever contemplated the application of the thermodynamic physics of cyclic heat engines to hypothethical analygous &quot;information&quot; engines? Consider that as you solve a wordle puzzle, from the perspective of the app software, which knows the answer ahead of time, shannon entropy remains constant throughout - there is only one answer to the puzzle. However, from the perspective of the player , a game starts at the minimum level of shannon entropy, increases as bits of information are radiated to the player through the process of solving culminating in the high shannon entropy state of the player &quot;knowing the answer&quot; . Then the slate is wiped clean, back to the original minimum level of shannon entropy as a new game is started and the player is hooked - Can Work be extracted from this cyclic &quot;entropy drop&quot; just as it is from a carnot engine? By working to develop &quot;the ultimate algorithm&quot; are you increasing the efficiency of the engine&#39;s operation up to the physical limits?

In thermodynamics, entropy is actually not a measure of chaos (as it&#39;s often believed) but rather a measure of chaos-ability. Every system has some amount of energy (=information in your case), and the more ways of distributing energy exist, the higher the entropy. A bunch of pencils laying on the floor has higher entropy then the same number of balls, as the pencils chaotically thrown on the floor can assume more different patterns then spherical balls. It is just as you have shown at 13-minute mark: for 3^5 possible patterns the entropy is high, because the information (=energy in physical sense) can be distributed in various ways. But when there are only 8 possible patterns, the number of possible words (or in physics, the number of energy states that can be assumed) is limited, and as a result the entropy is low.<br>After this long introduction, in this sense I wanted to point out that the Figure presented at <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v68zYyaEmEA&amp;t=12m38s\">12:38</a> is in my opinion wrong: since in both cases there are 70 red and 70 blue circles, the number of states (placements of circles) each figure can assume is the same, and thus entropy of both pictures is identical. Left and right figure are just different realizations of the same system, differently thrown pencils. BUT if you were to add some rules (which in chemistry would be interactions between gas/solid molecules, while here you could have rules like &quot;red must always neighbor other red&quot;, with pencils it could be connecting some of them using string), the entropy would actually change.<br>I hope I made it clear, though it is difficult to do that with only text!

If your first guess hits the letter T, then you are more likely to see the letters H, R, S in the word. Etc. As well, if you pick a guess word that includes letters that make up half of a digraph, and that letter is not a &quot;hit&quot;, then you can rule out all words containing the digraph incorporating the missed letter.  For example, if you pick the word &quot;DOUGH&quot;, and you don&#39;t get a hit on D, G, or H, then you know you can rule out words that have the common digraphs: LD, RD, GR, GL, ING, CH, CHR. <br><br>Also, some letters occur much more frequently at the start or end of a word.

I think an alternative version of this algorithm could be made using meta information about English word structure rather than a set list of possible word choices. When I play I prioritize vowels and always start with ADIEU, because there are only 5 vowels, most words have 1 or 2, and the number and identity of the vowels give you more clues about the word. For example, if there is one vowel it will most likely be in the middle, and with two vowels they will most likely be in position 2 and 4. Some combinations commonly go together, such as EA or OI, and others are less likely such as EU. If I get no vowels on ADIEU then my second guess is MOORS to eliminate the OO, identify the most likely location of the O, and S, R, and M are all common letters. Some letters are highly positionally dependent, such as S likely being in the 1 or 5 position. Q will almost always be in the 1 position, and is always followed by U. There are also common syllables and consonant clusters in English; SH, SL, ST, SP, and SN are all very common but SV, SM, SJ, SZ, and SX are not. To combine this together in an example, an O in position 3 would help me narrow down the end of the word to sounds like OLE, OCK, OTH, OGH, ONS, OWN, etc. Having one additional consonant would narrow down the possibilities much more, for example an H would always go at the end (O-H) and not adjacent (OH-).<br>I play on hard mode and can typically solve in 3 guesses, but this strategy has weaknesses such as the IGHT ending; you can solve this on round one and still not win due to many possibilities for the first consonant (L, R, T, F, S, M, N, W). Anyway if you&#39;re looking for a challenge and want to dig into the &quot;rules&quot; of the English language, that&#39;d be my recommendation.", "comment_date": "2022-02-13T22:08:05Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "PringleV2", "comment_text": "my first word is always &quot;Audio&quot; has 4 vowels so you can judge those out!", "comment_date": "2022-02-13T22:05:18Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Susan Melichar", "comment_text": "Also instead of doing this I just use arise and mount for my first 2 words bc it has all the vowels and it\u2019s has common letters", "comment_date": "2022-02-13T22:01:18Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Paul Sophocleous", "comment_text": "<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v68zYyaEmEA&amp;t=7m22s\">7:22</a> What about WORRY?", "comment_date": "2022-02-13T21:57:25Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "1lymaya alt", "comment_text": "Unfortunately for us in Ireland and the UK, where we speak English, we spell words correctly.

We would have to make sure that the letters line up with what we&#39;d expect if it were a random sample for the most part, because otherwise, it might be the case that uncommon letters are actually a fair bit more common than the letters we&#39;d most expect and then this algorithm wouldn&#39;t be as optimal. For example, if the person choosing the words each day is generally tricky, they might use repeating and uncommon letters more often than if the word were randomly selected from the list, or if they&#39;re more accommodating then words with double letters might almost never appear and they might not think about which words would be interesting to have people guess so they&#39;ll be much more common words on average.<br><br>What this boils down to is that if there&#39;s a human element to the chosen words, then there could be an algorithm that gives a much better score than the one in this video (as excellently crafted as it was). I&#39;d be interested in a program that studied the words that have actually been given on Wordle and compared the frequencies of those letters with the frequencies of all the possible answers (or all the possible 5-letter words) and then trained itself on the set with the new letter frequencies in mind, which would probably give it significant predictive power for new words if the same person is selecting them. A good machine learning algorithm could probably enable a fair number of 2-round wins in that case, no? <br><br>(With that said, this consideration could&#39;ve already been dealt with in this video and it was just too unimportant to mention, or if the selected word frequencies already match with the actual frequencies in English then all is good and I like the algorithm a lot so my post isn&#39;t really relevant. It&#39;d still be cool to see other people&#39;s algorithms and see if there are ways to even better improve it though.)", "comment_date": "2022-02-13T03:19:34Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "1 of 7.8 billion", "comment_text": "I got it in 2 tries once, no I\u2019m not capping here", "comment_date": "2022-02-13T03:11:51Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Crankedbot", "comment_text": "I usually start with stare I think it has most common vowels and consonants", "comment_date": "2022-02-13T03:09:09Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Irenic Cryogenic", "comment_text": "<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v68zYyaEmEA&amp;t=5m38s\">5:38</a> <br>Wigga is a word, lmfaoooo", "comment_date": "2022-02-13T03:07:10Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Xpearyinse", "comment_text": "I like to start with the word &quot;STARE&quot; it has the most common letters that appear in words.", "comment_date": "2022-02-13T03:06:10Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Justin Thyme", "comment_text": "I\u2019m in strong belief that \u201cadieu\u201d is the best opening word coz you knock out almost every vowel", "comment_date": "2022-02-13T02:58:44Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Trout Haven", "comment_text": "OILED &gt; CRANE", "comment_date": "2022-02-13T02:55:27Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Gojira Edits", "comment_text": "nerd", "comment_date": "2022-02-13T02:53:15Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "monique", "comment_text": "ik it\u2019s not rlly important but regarding ur comment on using nails vs snail, snail would actually be the better choice bc wordle doesn\u2019t use plural words", "comment_date": "2022-02-13T02:49:01Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Niamh-Creates", "comment_text": "I start with &quot;ADIEU&quot;, then usually a &quot;ST*CK&quot; word depending on the information ADIEU gave me.

(I am pretty sure I am reading too deeply into it, because the real reason he picked &quot;favor&quot; instead of &quot;tares&quot; was probably because it happened to work out particularly nicely for the example he wanted to describe, but let\u2019s pretend that that wasn&#39;t the case \ud83d\ude0a.) Keep in mind that he hadn&#39;t finished optimizing his algorithm, so it\u2019s not like he was distrusting the laws of mathematics in his choice to pick \u201cfavor\u201d instead of \u201ctares.\u201d Also, even if he had finished optimizing his algorithm, I don&#39;t agree with the rules that he used to optimize it. (I think that he should have optimized his algorithm to win within 3 (or 2) guesses the most often, rather than optimizing to have the lowest average score (the difference is subtle, but important to me), but that is besides the main point I want to make in this post. LOL) He had probably picked &quot;tares&quot; as his first choice many times before, so that was probably already a well explored path. By picking &quot;favor&quot; instead, it might be that he was using his intuition to explore a different path. Often, we get so used to just doing what we think is supposed to be the most optimal path that we forget to listen to our intuition or forget to listen to God. Sometimes when we ask God a question, through prayer, we get an answer that seems much less than optimal, but that may just be because our optimization algorithm is flawed, compared to God&#39;s optimization algorithm for our lives.<br><br>But then, do we do the opposite? Do we always trust God and never trust in the optimization algorithms we made with our own mental strength (the plans we made ourselves for our lives)? Well... that is a tough question, for a bunch of reasons, one of them being that the question is worded deceitfully. When that question said &quot;do we always trust in God...&quot; that gave the impression that God always has an opinion on what the best choice is for every decision that we do. That is a false assumption. There are many things that God wants us to get the correct answer for from Him, through prayer, but for most decisions in our life, He doesn&#39;t care one way or the other. We will not know which He cares about and which he doesn\u2019t unless we pray, study the scriptures, and listen to the promptings of the Holy Ghost speaking to our mind/heart (which promptings many people just think of as just being part of their intuition).<br><br>Also, the question of, &quot;do we always trust in God, instead of our own thoughts,&quot; is deceivingly worded, because it implies that following God&#39;s answers to our prayerful questions will remove our responsibility to think for ourselves. In actuality, most of the answers I get from God come to me as I am researching to find the answer to a question, especially if I pray to ask for inspiration before the start of my research session. Also, when I am praying, most of the answers I get from God come in the form of, &quot;did you think to research or check that one thing?&quot; I do sometimes get answers that say &quot;yes&quot; or &quot;no,&quot; and sometimes, to my shame, I have lived to regret ignoring those answers, but &quot;yes&quot; or &quot;no&quot; answers are rarer for me, personally. Also, God often does not immediately give answers to questions in the form of &quot;what should I do about this?&quot; because often God wants us to try to think of a solution for ourselves and then go back and ask a Him a question in the form of, &quot;Heavenly Father, I have such and such problem and I think I should do such and such plan to fix it for such and such reasons. Should I do that plan? What do you think about it?&quot; To ask a question in that form often requires a lot more thought (and personal growth) to ask, compared to asking a simple question of &quot;what should I do about this?&quot;. He is our Father in heaven so he wants his kids to grow.<br><br>It is important to God&#39;s plan for us that we try different things, sometimes make mistakes, learn from our mistakes, use the Atonement of Jesus Christ to have our sins be washed away, and learn to trust God&#39;s plan through our own experience. God doesn&#39;t want mindless robots in heaven with Him. Heavenly Father wants his children (us) to trust him, in heaven with Him, not because we are forced to trust Him, but because we have decided, on our own, through experience, that we want to be the type of person/people who trust Him. Unlike mindless robots, we can make decisions for ourselves and choose to follow God&#39;s will, because we trust Him, when God&#39;s will is applicable to the situation.", "comment_date": "2022-02-12T01:48:03Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Toothy36", "comment_text": "I have a maths degree and looked into this.

Wordle, not so much,<br><br>* The misspelling of words is horrific. &quot;Color&quot; &amp; &quot;favor&quot; are not words, they are bastardizations of words that have lost all practical meaning in the spelling.<br>* Words which should not exist by the &quot;no proper nouns&quot; rule are allowed, such as &quot;genoa&quot;.

If you&#39;re going to allow one set of disambiguations, you have to allow ALL disambiguations.<br><br>Best opener I&#39;ve found so far,<br><br>* OPALS into LAHAR if L &amp; A, into HORSE/SONET if S &amp; O. No consistent rule for handling P &amp; L, but getting an R &amp; E in the second word are really good.<br>* The basic assumption is that E exists so commonly in English, it&#39;s easier to come up with a word that includes E than does not. Therefore we assume E exists for the first guess, and focus instead on the other common vowels. <br>* P, L, &amp; S are often conjunctive consonants, so knowing if they are <b>not</b> present is super meaningful.

It seemed like your algorithm was following prior right answers. <br><br>If you have a 2 word starter, say CRANE - JOUST (just an example), you would be covering nearly every vowel and common letter.

But not all and I would caution that CRANE leaves essential letters in spots that make a lot of syllables. A and E can nearly go anywhere and be a part of sound. It might be smarter (for a human brain) to use a word like AISLE that isolates the A and E from each other. You&#39;d still have the information on the 2 most common vowels and as a bonus add a 3rd and get the S, one of the most common consonants. <br><br>Anyways, given the proclivities of the human equation, I think less common starter words (less common in structure, sound and even appearance) will help most people. <br><br>This isn&#39;t about efficiency, just not failing.

The best I manged to do each step of the way is cut in half the number of possible men<br>2. The seesaw is binary - it only tells you if a given group contains or not the unique person<br>From those two points I realised  that the second point proves that the first is correct, because of the second point you are limited to learn 1 guaranteed bit each step. imagine the problem was with 16 men then each men can be coded with one 4 bit number and we will need 4 bit (or measures  of the seesaw) in order to find the men. since 12 is bigger then 8 then it requires more than 3 bits and therefore the puzzle is impossible to solve!!! Intrestingly enough if you knew if the man is heavier or lighter then the seesaw will have 3 options and it will give you log2(3)=1.585 bits and you need log2(12) =3.585 bits and therfore since 3.585/1.585=2.262&lt;3 you will be able to find the person in 3 uses of the seesaw!<br>Hope you liked it, it was fun to me:) great video!", "comment_date": "2022-02-10T07:40:28Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "TrainingBen", "comment_text": "I, and a few others spent some time making PHP scripts in attempt to find not only a best possible guess but also trying to completely recreate the game, (The idea was fun at the time I suppose).

Coming from someone who has been studying entropy in Physics, I say that this video can give us a real push about questioning entropy as statistical mechanical variable for small system.<br><br>One could use this program to describe the influence of initial states (in classical systems) on the production of entropy. I&#39;m not sure, though, if that would be possible via your code, since it may require some refinement for its inner workings such as describing space or trajectory to have relevant probability amplitudes to infer most typical trajectory or even most probable trajectory, say, in the case of stochastic thermodynamics. For now, I leave that as a thought, because it may need more thinking than just saying it could be used. <br><br>By the way, I love the way you explained entropy and information, because even after years of using it, that was also illuminating and deep to me. When I first stumbled upon entropy, I was very skeptical, because it sounds a bit arbitrary, at least, the way Boltzmann initially defined according to textbooks. After a few years, I understood that he was looking for a probabilistic description to the dynamics of small parts of a macroscopical object and with Gibbs&#39; help both constructed the basis of thermodynamics via statistical mechanics. However, it is still intriguing when we are speaking of non-equilibrium thermodynamics when trajectories of small systems comes to play as parameter for probability amplitudes and, for instance, we can come up with a definition for the second law in nanoscale that does not violate the second law in the macro scale, but it does hold a probabilistic meaning.

For each SuperList:<br>        get the sum of:<br>             the absolute difference in size between the count of each its sub-lists and &quot;SixthTL&quot;.<br>    iii. The DV equals that sum.<br><br>10. Pick the SuperList with the smallest DV and use its found word(s) as your first guess.<br>   -The SuperLists with the smallest DV have the &quot;best&quot; word(s) to start with, and the lists with the largest DV have the &quot;worst&quot; word(s) to start with.<br>    -You should save the &quot;top&quot; SuperLists with for later testing.<br><br>11. Once you make a guess, you will select the relevant sub-list from the SuperList that was used, and save all of the &quot;Confirmed&quot; letters (and their positions) and all of the &quot;Excluded&quot; letters. This is done by searching for &quot;Confirmed&quot; letters (letters confirmed to exist in the answer) in order of how the SuperList was created.<br><br>For Example:<br>Starting with you::<br>    The SuperList used was &quot;SuperListLABDE&quot;.<br>    The guessed word was BLADE.<br>And the game tells you::<br>    The letters B and D were confirmed to be in the answer.<br>    B is in the proper position (e.g. &quot;P0&quot;).<br>    D is in the wrong position (e.g. &quot;P3&quot;).<br>Then you would save::<br>    The sub-list &quot;SansAListB&quot; (as B comes before D in the chosen SuperList &quot;SuperListLABDE&quot;)<br>Confirmed letters: B (and its position), D (and it&#39;s NOT position)<br>Excluded letters: L A E<br><br>Example 2:<br>None of the letters are &quot;Confirmed&quot; then the sub-list &quot;SansLABDEList&quot; would be selected.<br>Confirmed letters:<br>Excluded letters: L A B D E<br><br>12. Now you will efficiently make a new &quot;TotalList&quot; from the selected sub-list and the saved letters.<br>    \u00bbExclude all words that have letters that are &quot;Excluded&quot;<br>    \u00bbOnly include words from sub-list that contain the &quot;Confirmed&quot; letters, being sure to include what&#39;s known about their position as well.<br><br>13. Repeat the whole process over from step 2 to step 10, with this new &quot;TotalList&quot; starting point, in order to find the next guess, based on the results continue the process.<br><br>FINAL NOTE: Because the second round of guessing will be directly influenced by the first round of guessing, it is probably worth testing all the &quot;top&quot; first words (saved in step 10) many, many, many times to see how this algorithm performs with each of them.", "comment_date": "2022-02-09T17:36:58Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "BradiKal61", "comment_text": "I play Wordle starting with RATIO as my &quot;killer first word &quot;.

If none of the vowels are green or yellow we know that A and I must be in the word, with the slight exception of maybe some rare words like CRYPT. We also know some positional things, such that if a vowel is in the center, then its likely to be preceeded by a consonant digraph.

It seems sigmoid functions are just intuitively applicable to a lot of things. In my case, arctan probably popped into my head because of a history of having tried to use it for an aim bot AI, which unfortunately hadn&#39;t worked due to the context it was for requiring quaternion math (before I knew what quaternions even were, some 15 years ago).<br><br>It may be worth mentioning to other readers that the sigmoid function you chose appears to be the logistic function, and that other functions are considered &quot;sigmoid functions&quot; as well, including arctan(x) and even tanh(x). It seems referring to the logistic function as the &quot;sigmoid function&quot; is popular, however, at least when discussing NNs. I actually just checked my old (also around 15 years) NN code from when I was first learning about them, and it actually uses tanh for its sigmoid function.", "comment_date": "2022-02-09T09:44:36Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Leo Official", "comment_text": "hi", "comment_date": "2022-02-09T09:43:59Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "UND3RCUT 53", "comment_text": "information is acttually multiplying to we are just using logarithms so it looks like it is adding but in fact is is also multiplying too", "comment_date": "2022-02-09T09:32:48Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "\u00dcber\u015bmieszek", "comment_text": "I didn&#39;t watch the full video yet, but won&#39;t the algorithm be very similar to ones used for solving Mastermind?", "comment_date": "2022-02-09T09:30:33Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Da Phenomenalz", "comment_text": "<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v68zYyaEmEA&amp;t=30m22s\">30:22</a> so many Johns", "comment_date": "2022-02-09T09:28:05Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Paymon", "comment_text": "Do a video on hard mode please", "comment_date": "2022-02-09T09:27:56Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Peter Erichsen", "comment_text": "<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v68zYyaEmEA&amp;t=18m37s\">18:37</a> fine, take my like.

Discard any words that have repetition of the same letter (like 2 S\u2019s or 2 P\u2019s, etc.) Would not this strategy maximize both \u2018frequency analysis\u2019 and \u2018positional analysis? <br><br>I agree with you that utilizing the list of possible answers would be too much like cheating.

However, I haven&#39;t found a way to formalize the optimal way to play the game. It&#39;ll be great to know your take on it. The concept of the game is like that: Suppose you are in an exam and you have to answer a set of True or False questions. Also, suppose you do not know the correct answers to any of the questions. In this situation, all you can do is random guessing and normally your chance score will be around 50%. Let\u2019s say the teacher who marks your work gives you many more trials to answer the same set of the questions and you can peek at your total score at the end of each trial. What is the optimal way to maximize the information gain from your past trials to reach the perfect score with a minimal number of trials?<br>The obvious answer is to mutate the choices one by one and peak at your total score after each trial until your reach the perfect score. In this case, if you have 100 true and false questions. First, set all your choices to false and by chance you may get 50 correct answers. Then, change each of your false choices one by one to true and peek at the the total score again to see if your change increased the total score. This way you might need up to 100 trials to reach perfect score! However, if you mutate more than one question at the same time before peeking at your total score, it&#39;s possible to gain more information and reach the perfect score with less trials but it gets trickier as you mutate more questions at the same time.

God sent his Son, Jesus, to Earth as a perfect sinless sacrifice. To take on all the sins of the world; both past, present, and future sins. Shedding his blood on the cross as a blood atonement for all sins. After dying on the cross, he rose from the dead on the 3rd day and rose to Heaven. To show life after death. To show everlasting life through Jesus&#39;s sacrifice. John 14:6 states: &quot;Jesus saith unto him, I am the way, the truth, and the life: no man cometh unto the Father, but by me.&quot;. Romans 10:13 states &quot;For whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved.&quot;. \r<br>\r<br>   Eternal life in heaven is just one prayer away. All you have to do is believe that Jesus Christ, the Son of God, died on the cross for your sins. As an atonement for your sins. And rose from the grave on the 3rd day. Ask Jesus to save you of your sins and give you eternal life in Heaven. Salvation is a free and everlasting gift from God. Please don&#39;t let pride drag you into eternal punishment in Hell, but ask Jesus to give you eternal life in Heaven. If you&#39;re getting a strong feeling of resistance while reading this, it&#39;s because Satan doesn&#39;t want you to get saved. He wants you to resist, and think it&#39;s not real. He wants you in Hell for all eternity with him. Hell is not a fun place, like worldly people like to imagine. It&#39;s everlasting torture with no relief. I&#39;m only taking the time to text this, because I want to get the message out. There are so many distractions in life keeping people from witnessing to other people. Keeping people from thinking about salvation. Keeping you from thinking about life after death. Please, ask Jesus into your hearts to save you of your sins and cleanse you from all unrighteousness.

Mine purely uses frequency analysis and foregoes entropy. Given that I knew it wasn&#39;t really possible to get it in 2, I knew I had to optimise the first 2 guesses as much as possible, so I generated all possible pairs of two words, and filtered them to only have the 10 most common english letters in. This gave me a shortlist of about 700 choices, I just had to work out which was best. The frequency analysis portion optimised my selections for yellows, now I just had to optimise for greens. I did a frequency analysis on which letter was the most common in each position of the words, then scored every pair based on how common their letters were in their respective spots. This let me score each pair, so just sort by the score, and I have my preferred starter.<br>spoilers<br>spoilers<br>spoilers<br>spoilers<br>spoilers<br>So in the end, the top answer I got was &quot;caret loins&quot;. This optimises both for greens and yellows, but ignores what might come next, and doesn&#39;t take into consideration the first result before giving the second, so it will be less efficient than the entropy-based one. However, I also made a quick script that filters by the results of the first two words, and just gives me all possible words that match the results, and I can usually make a decent guess based on how common I think the words are, and can usually get it in 3. Sometimes there will only be one word left anyway, which is fun.

I have a fair amount of input on the linguistic side of this. Namely that your first mistake was using the results of Mayzner&#39;s letter frequency analysis. For a start, it used a very small sample size (of about 20,000 words) that ended up getting <i>close</i> but not <i>accurate</i> to the true letter frequency of English. We&#39;ve done way better since then. In particular, Peter Norvig used Google corpus data to get a sample size of hundreds of billions of words.<br><br>And even though that one is more accurate, it is also <i>very</i> important to point out that that is an <i>absolute</i> frequency; not the <i>variant</i> frequency. There are 3 types of letter frequencies. The absolute frequency is that of usage, where, for example, &quot;the&quot; being a common word with high repetition means that it increases the frequency of T, H, and E. That isn&#39;t applicable to Wordle, because Wordle only considers each word once, and each is equally probable (discounting that previous words won&#39;t appear again). Instead, the <i>variant</i> frequency is the one that would apply to Wordle. The variant frequency is that which looks at all words in the language, including each variation of the word (e.g. &quot;bright&quot; and &quot;brightly&quot;), and each only once. It gives a different distribution. The third type of frequency is the root frequency, which looks at only root words without prefixes and suffixes (e.g. &quot;bright&quot;, but not &quot;brightly&quot;), to take out the effect that regular plurals and gerunds and so on have on the letter frequency.<br><br>The other problem though, is that those letter frequencies aren&#39;t looking at only the 5-letter words in the language. The list of 5-letter words has a different distribution than <i>all</i> words.<br><br>I actually ran letter frequency analysis on Wordle&#39;s list of answers, and there are two to consider:<br><br>1.) The basic, upfront letter frequencies, which is:<br>EAROTLISNCUYDHPMGBFKWVZXQJ<br><br>and 2.) The frequency not of the letters, but of the <i>words</i> that contain those letters, which is more <i>useful</i> for Wordle&#39;s mechanics, and is:<br>EAROTLISNUCYHDPGMBFKWVXZQJ<br><br>This is actually the strategy I use, <i>mostly</i> because it is very <i>easy</i> to reference. It keeps it a casual game without having to do a lot of calculation each round, or each game. And it works beautifully. I use &quot;orate&quot; as my starter guess. I haven&#39;t gone higher than 5 guesses yet. Personally, I also play on hard-mode, with additional self-imposed rules, like requiring that correct letters in the wrong space not be guessed in that same space again on subsequent guesses. Because it is known to be incorrect. Default hard-mode doesn&#39;t impose that. I also <i>only</i> play using Words in the game&#39;s answer library. I reference it to be sure. I&#39;m aware that it is possible that <i>both</i> of these rules (and even hard mode rules) could be preventing guesses that would convey more <i>information,</i> but I&#39;m a bit of an all-or-nothing minmaxer, and, to me, a guess that <i>can&#39;t</i> be the answer is a <i>wasted</i> guess.<br><br>I also came up with a hypothetical way to find an - arguably - best word, but it would require programming skills that I don&#39;t have. It would be to match each word as a first guess against every word as the answer and look at all of the possible outputs each guess-and-answer pair would generate, and then to tally how many possible words each of those outputs <i>could</i> be, and then choose for the first guess whichever word has the lowest <i>maximum</i> number of possible words that its possible outputs would reduce to, and if multiple have the same lowest maximum, take whichever has the lowest <i>average</i> number of possible words it can reduce the list to. It may not be the <i>statistically</i> most optimal strategy, but it would be more pleasing, and I believe probably less likely to run out of guesses. But again, my extra-hard-mode rules might effect that.<br><br>EDIT: Apparently, &quot;orate&quot; wasn&#39;t in the list of possible answers this whole time. I presumed it was, because it is a pretty normal word. I didn&#39;t even think to check that one before deciding to use it as a starter. Huh.

If the two signals you&#39;re quantifying as entropy have any correlation (or more formally covariance), then their entropy is reduced, possibly to no more than one of the signals because the other is redundant. For example, if in a very silly language every word that had an &quot;a&quot; also had a &quot;b&quot;, then the entropy of the two does not add together; when we know a word contains &quot;a&quot; there is no entropy required to know it also contains &quot;b&quot;.<br><br>I&#39;m not a mathematician and this is probably not the correct formal way to express the idea. I learned this limitation from the old days of Bayesian machine learning (e.g. the very first spam filters) where &quot;naive Bayesian classification&quot; assumes that all signals are independent. It explicitly acknowledges that this is an approximation with inaccuracy you can&#39;t quantify without computing all covariance between all combinations of all signals, which quickly becomes computationally intractable with diminishing returns.<br><br>Modern methods like deep neural nets strike a balance where the most significant informational relationships can be captured implicitly, while the finite complexity/resource budget cuts off the long tail of measurable but unjustifiable connections.<br><br>That said, massive kudos for saying you don&#39;t want to use the answer list in your analysis.

Essentially, letters that are weighted towards appearing in certain types of words or in certain letter combinations should be more valuable guesses than their simple frequency should predict. C is probably at a sweet spot where it&#39;s not too uncommon a letter, and enjoys a big boost from giving you a lot of bonus information if you do find one.<br><br>Further to this, if you have, say, two certain letters that often appear in combination, it makes sense strategically to include one of these letters and not both in an early guess, as the odds of these letters appearing in the word are far from being independent odds, so guessing one gives you information on the probability of the other - bonus information from just one guessed letter. Hence, since CH and CK are very common associations of letters in common English words, guessing a C but not an H or a K in your first word seems to make a lot of sense from an information standpoint, and I&#39;m not surprised that an algorithm found that guessing a word containing a C first was smart, despite C being quite a way down the letter frequency list.", "comment_date": "2022-02-07T02:37:53Z", "likes_count": 94}, {"comment_by": "Slow Flight", "comment_text": "<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v68zYyaEmEA&amp;t=18m40s\">18:40</a> golden", "comment_date": "2022-02-07T02:35:44Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "vara vashtul", "comment_text": "Tares is a normal word to me.

It can be used as-is for a vegan option, but tends to be a tad one-dimensional; often another method of making dashi is included. This can be katsuobushi (also known as bonito flakes; essentially fermented fish flakes) which is done essentially the same way (you take the already heated kombu dashi and add your bonito flakes, heating again until the flavor has seeped into the dashi and then removing the flakes afterward), but I tend to prefer cold brew (less washing up!) so I combine it with shiitake dashi instead. This is as simple as adding dried shiitake mushrooms to the cold brew alongside the kombu; as a bonus, the mushrooms will rehydrate and can be used in whatever dish you&#39;re preparing (I&#39;m an Udon fellow myself, but there are a lot of ways to use dashi; it&#39;s very much a staple of Japanese cooking)<br><br>For more information visit Just One Cookbook, a Japanese cooking site that finally got me into making decent meals.

I played around with writing a solver myself and got very close to those numbers, although I didn&#39;t make the cognitive leap to think about it as entropy - but I felt the main optimisation from there would be to consider the extra information you get from letter placement, and picking words that give you more information by trying words with specific letters in specific slots.

Information theory comes from trying to measure the efficiency of communication of information. <br><br>So the key idea is that, if we want to quantify information, really what we&#39;re doing is trying to measure how well one actor is communicating to another actor about an event. <br><br>So the two actors need to come up with some dictionary, or what is often called an &quot;encoding&quot; in order to communicate events to one another. <br><br>The the second key idea, is that It takes more energy to communicate with more symbols (&quot;symbols&quot; could be words, bits, smoke signals, whatever is your base unit of information). <br><br>Therefore, our objective is to assign the least amount of symbols to all the possible events, so we should encode according to how common different events are. More common events, should use less symbols.<br><br>The inverse of a probability has this great name, called &quot;the surprisal&quot;, the idea is that the higher the number, the more &quot;surprising&quot; an event is. Like if I were to tell you the sky just instantly changed from blue to magenta, that event would have a wildly high surprisal, because it has a really low probability. <br><br>The reason we put a log on the surprisal is to get &quot;how many symbols do we need in order to communicate this event?&quot;, the base of your log determines the number of symbols available to you, most commonly we use base 2 because we&#39;re usually thinking of this in bits. <br><br>The entropy of a probability distribution is the average number of bits required to communicate events in said probability distribution. <br><br>Hope someone else found that interesting!

I think that this video merely proposes the mathematically optimal greedy algorithm for wordle, and not the absolute best. The analogy to information theory is great. The way I view the optimal algorithm for Wordle is one that takes all Wordle states as a graph, and connects them such that A points at B if the word you guess at A could lead to the state B, and all leaf nodes (full word state) are part of the graph. Then you rank each possible graph based on your criteria for what makes the optimal graph (smallest maximum depth, average depth, etc). This is similar to compression algorithms in that it could be viewed very similar to how a huffman table is, except instead of binary 1s or 0s, it&#39;s each 5-letter word. And these huffman trees are usually built by a greedy algorithm similar to the one you&#39;ve proposed in this video, but it doesn&#39;t necessarily mean it&#39;s the optimal one overall.

I think it&#39;s the wrong choice, and I think why explains something about the algorithm a human player uses versus what the machine is doing.<br><br>For me, when I try and look at a word given specific possibilities, I am not looking at it as a string of text but as a string of sounds, which is important here. Crane is difficult to start with because it doesn&#39;t narrow many things down phonotactically: the two consonants at the start are only a valid consonant cluster in a handful of words, and putting the vowel in the 3rd position doesn&#39;t provide any information about whether there is a consonant cluster at the beginning. This is why I like to start with &quot;paste&quot;, because if the A is in the word and placed correctly it negates any word starting with a consonant cluster. On the other hand, if it is not, the s-t-p combination provides two valid consonant clusters and their order: if s-t or s-p is in the word, it&#39;s likely that they are at the beginning or end in that order. On the other hand, if t-p is in the word, there is very little likelihood that they are together at all. <br><br>This strategy also extends to the letter C in general, which can be pronounced in several ways which also leaves several sets of words open which are difficult to search through mnemonically.<br><br>Because of these factors I think that the question of what is the optimal word to start with is different for a computer compared to a human - a computer in general has a great ability to search for all words that could be the answer, but needs to be told what the probabilities are. On the other hand, a human is much better at predicting what words might be next but can have trouble interpreting the data it gets from its previous guesses unless the guesses are formatted to be easily interpreted.<br><br>I think it would be interesting to try and build a computer program that uses a human-like algorithm that works using phonetics and letter clusters instead of the string-focused approach used here, I would be interested to see if the average score could be improved by that sort of process.", "comment_date": "2022-02-06T18:52:58Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "sbyrfang", "comment_text": "Interesting video, real good stuff.

Not having all the mathematical and theoretical tools at my disposal, I initially tried keeping track of how many (remaining, valid) words contained a letter at a position. For example, at initialization, there are 141 answers with &quot;A&quot; in the first position. To select a guess, I perform a greedy search over the remaining possibilities by summing these values for each letter in the guess candidate at the according position. So, SLATE (which happens to be my code&#39;s first guess choice) is 1437=[366,201,307,139,424]. My reasoning here was that if I could guess the most common letter at each position, it&#39;s either likely to be correct (get a green, get closer to the answer fast) or rule out many words (with a black). This naive solution wound up with an average of about 3.681 turns to guess all the words, but the max guesses is 8. I was able to tweak it to solve them all in under 6 and keep a similar average (3.689) by taking a guess intended to disambiguate similar words.<br><br>I feel like there are some underlying ties between the approach you describe and my intuition here (in particular, my mental intuition valued selecting for flat distributions for some vague definition of that), but I&#39;m not sure what causes them to differ so much in outcome; I wonder if there is something interesting to tease out here?", "comment_date": "2022-02-06T16:38:52Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "TeEmZe", "comment_text": "<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v68zYyaEmEA&amp;t=27m44s\">27:44</a> why is the uncertainty not subtracted by the information anymore?

It assumes that maximising entropy is always the best thing to do. Now for a matter of practical implications it is basically the best approach. But in an ideal world, a word with less entropy might actually be a better choice. (By better, I mean results in fewer average remaining guesses to reach the answer). The reason for this is that because of the restricted possible guesses in wordle, certain word sets may be easier or harder to get information out of. I assume this is what Grant was trying to address in his approach looking two moves ahead. E.g. a guess might give you 5 bits of information, but on the next guess you expect to only get 3 bits. Whereas another guess might give you 4 bits now, but you expect to be able to get 5 bits on you next guess. To really have the optimal strategy you would want to look all the way to the end of the game to account for all of this, but that would probably be to intensive for a computer program so perhaps a different approach is needed.

Since most files are constructed through rules, there usually is a certain regularity to those bits, ex: 00000111110000011111. There is a clear pattern in that sequence, if it continued on for 20kb I could just say (5x0+5x1)x2000, of course it would be in binary so a bit longer, but still waaay shorter than 20kb, essentially what I did is compressed my file. I remember in class learning that the theoretical limit for compression is maximum entropy, or in other words the bit sequence is so &quot;random&quot; it is 100% information, no pattern.<br><br>Ok now I want to think of the heads or tails problem in terms of bit. There is a common trend amongst probability teachers to ask &quot;which is more likely? 00000000000000000000 or 101000100101001011111&quot;, and then everyone picks the 2nd one and they say &quot;AH sucker, they are both equally likely&quot;.<br><br>My question is: is that really so?? Because the second sequence contains way more information than the first one, it&#39;s &quot;incompressible&quot;. So if you think about it in terms of information, when we detect patterns in the output, we intuitively associate this with a lower likelyhood, cause I think we do understand on an intuitive level that entropy [almost] always increases. So if instead of calculating the probability of a specific sequence, but instead calculate the probability to yield a certain quantity of information (which is how I think we all understand that problem the first time we hear it) I think  there is an answer to this question. Maybe this is all a wording issue, maybe it would be correct to say that even if both sequences are equally probable, one is more &quot;plausible&quot;, anyways, is there any truth in what I&#39;m saying or am I just completely lost?", "comment_date": "2022-02-06T16:03:25Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "TheRatorX", "comment_text": "I&#39;m unsure about one thing, and that is if that optimizing for the maximum expectation information of the current try is optimal, instead of optimizing for a sequence of tries.
