What I did to make it understand easier is take the area/definite integral of sin (x) between 0 and \u03c0 which is 2  as a rectangle region rather than the given region with curved bounds. It is fine as long as the value of the area is the same. Then when you divide 2 by \u03c0 which is the same as what is done on the video, I visualize it on my rectangle version that there is height*width=2 and width is \u03c0 so height = 2/\u03c0 which is the average. What made my rectangle work out is the fact that I know that the average of any given set of values is the value of all of the  total values of those number sets when distributed equally. Say for average of 2 and 4 is 3 because the values given are distributed to make the given number of items equal amount of values. This made what I thought of seeing as a rectangle as an already distributed values each item even infinite set of items because i have converted the same area of a curve-bound region to a simple rectangle.

I found a simpler way to think about it from Prof. Gilbert Strang&#39;s video (<a href=\"https://goo.gl/qFFqW1)\">https://goo.gl/qFFqW1)</a>. If a function f(x) is a derivative of another function F(x), then any point in its curve (=height) captures the changes in F(x) at that point. Therefore, the cumulative change in F(x) [=F(b)-F(a)] between points a and b will be equal to the sum of all the points on f(x) between those two points (=area under the curve). Now if we are able to find F(x) then we can find the area under the curve f(x) between any two points a and b by calculating F(b)-F(a).

This, in the cases that we&#39;ve always seen in algebra, works perfectly fine, but is not the most general concept of an average.

So when I later though about averages of functions, I thought okay, I can draw the average somewhere, and the same amount of stuff will be over it as under it. So the area of the rectangle where the interval is the width, when multiplied by the average value will equal the integral over that interval.
