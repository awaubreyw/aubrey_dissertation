All I want to do is learn the definitions that make up the mathematical scaffolding that allow access to think within these complex ideas. The first time my mind was blown was when I learned what a vector was... just a number, but this number is actually a magnitude made up of an x and y component. Who knew!? What an expanded way of thinking about it! But what exactly is a number?....... I am so totally compelled to build this mathematical lattice because I just want to be able to to explore and think within it.

(So I clicked, and voila, I was right to assume this).<br><br>As far as raising kids go, you could put it another way next time someone asks your opinion: &quot;People who don&#39;t have children raise them well&quot;. (Not sure who owns that epigram, but it&#39;s not me.)<br><br>My own opinion on this is that we should be playing to childrens strengths. When they&#39;re very little, they&#39;re little language acquisition machines, so we should forget the math for a while, and focus on making them polyglot/ growing the parts of their brains that want to grow wildly at that age. And then to make up for the lack of early maths (a word one should abbreviate in both of the ways, to subvert the dictatorial tendencies of the standardizers), later on you can drop the language acquisition part of eductation, and give more time to math. (I might be wrong about this, but it&#39;s my opinion, so it&#39;s pretty whizzbang all-spectacular and should form the basis for current curriculum planning just on that account).<br><br>Another thing one could perhaps use to motivate the more venal pupils (that would be most of them, I suspect, but maybe I&#39;m just projecting) would be to offer the ultimate reward to anyone setting about educating themselves well: an early parole from school. Details would get complicated, but one thing I think would be necessary is to quite finely modularize everything (instead of figuring out a middling years&#39; worth of subject matter). So instead of calculus number whatever, you have a limits module, a differentiation module, an integration module, and so on. Let learners finish these more or less in their own time, and more or less according to their own preferences. (I think it would quickly become necessary to have some &quot;college math&quot; available at school for those who rapidly move through their school math before completing their other &quot;educational essentials&quot;.<br><br>(You&#39;d have to decide what the essentials of a well rounded initial education should be, as well. Allow kids to follow their hearts, but also put barriers between them and their progressing in the fields they love, in the form of &quot;essential modules&quot; that need to be completed first).<br><br>As for the pass mark? Well done this way, you could just make it 100%? Then keep an eye out for whoever needs help. (Those who don&#39;t need help would be nice and low-maintenance, so it&#39;s an opportunity to learn what it might be that&#39;s impeding progress in various fields. And that might be English literature, for instance. (I have a cousin who quality-checks statistics PhD&#39;s from around the world who struggles to express himself on paper, even now, for instance. The struggles of someone like him with a &quot;barrier course&quot; in English might be something an educator with the time to devote to this might learn something fundamental from? And meanwhile his struggle is character-building. Life&#39;s going to dump a whole lot more struggles like that on him, so it&#39;s good to get some experience in a safe environment.", "comment_date": "2019-11-23T18:52:23Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "St\u00e9phane Melan\u00e7on", "comment_text": "You look like a guy who gives relaxing massages just using your voice.", "comment_date": "2019-11-23T18:49:54Z", "likes_count": 2}, {"comment_by": "Sanju Kumar", "comment_text": "My favourite mathematician is Narendra viswnath", "comment_date": "2019-11-23T18:44:54Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "John D\u0142ugosz", "comment_text": "I want to know how you held the camera.

Math teaches problem abstraction and solving and that&#39;s a skill I expect of entrepreneurs/CEOs and also of politicians, in short, any person with more influence and power over others.<br><br>I don&#39;t know how this is in the UK or USA, but one often cited narrative of people working in HR departments here is testing candidates for simple math as the rule of three. It&#39;s said to be a key indicator and then there&#39;s that interesting aspect that teaching the rule of three changed in the curriculum at a point, so the solution approach of some generation of applicants was considered wrong when it was just differing from what the generation of HR personnel knew.  <br><br>And that specific story doesn&#39;t only seem wrong but is anecdotal from the perspective of even just my own job interview experiences, and they also include one on the side of the interviewer.<br><br>Anyway, it still seems extremely awkward when a question like the following in Germany&#39;s &quot;Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?&quot; special edition for charity meets a politician - our minister for Labor and Social Affairs. And he can&#39;t apply common knowledge on the question, for which number the checksum is not larger than the square root: A) 16 B) 36 C) 64 D) 121. He used the &quot;Ask the Audience&quot; lifeline and they gave the correct recommendation of 90%. They did not have much time to think, because there only was about 1 minute of talking between that minister and the show host.<br><br>At least a good impression for the general audience and I&#39;d obviously not take this as a measure of how much more the general population knows more about math and logic than politicians. Its a situation of stress and the psychology of anxieties about sciences, but indeed that makes a bad impression and it&#39;s a good example of how using such indicators can backfire on you when you&#39;re tested instead of testing.<br><br>So while I agree there has to be more than simple memorized knowledge or just the need for math to do a job to come to revolutionary insights and be founder and explorer of new areas, I see the premise of enthusiasm as an important motivational factor as a wrong premise. It&#39;s a nice extra quality, that a topic motivates you when you&#39;re enthusiastic about it and it&#39;s a much better idea about importance than what I also already saw taken as an important factor: To think against current norms to revolutionalize instead of aiming for evolutionary changes. It&#39;s one argument I hear for flat-earthers, just as one pseudoscience.<br><br>The foundation of any scientific area should not be the kind of enthusiasm alone, it&#39;s always a tool for the progress of life quality and just like knowledge about healthy nutrition the enthusiasm is often off-center to the progress, you&#39;re not enthusiastic about cooking healthy but tasty food. And so the premise why math is important and how you make people realize that is about the importance of it being a skill you need even in topics you don&#39;t connect with mathematics. We&#39;re actually relying too much on intuition one of which is the intuition that expertise on a topic like the political ministries is giving someone an overview and confidence in right decisions just as intuition could be seen as what a neural network learns from observation alone by deriving a model that doesn&#39;t explain itself very analytical anymore, thus labeled as intuition. Most viable decisions to make don&#39;t work based on intuition alone but from analytical modeling. And that&#39;s what makes mathematics the topic of analytical problem-solving skills that is an obligation for anybody wanting to have responsibility for others and not a right.<br><br>If you think about how much people the economy needs in STEM-related professions the topic of making students enthusiastic is another point of view, but I doubt aiming for that results in a good overall outcome, as much as you can be convinced about a good society and progressive civilization resulting from overall enthusiasm of people about their work and profession. Your work-life compares to household chores in many aspects. If enthusiasm was the main goal the economy would mainly consist of entertainers and artists, even considering not everybody is an extrovert. Enthusiasm or more general motivation about anything, not only your job is an important driver, but it can&#39;t be the only one. Also not money. Enthusiasm doesn&#39;t need to be an inherent factor of any work, you should always keep in mind anything you do is about helping others and contributing to the society like you take a lot of things being done for you and granted to be available for a portion of the money you earn as a perhaps too generic mean of purchasing power for the equivalent services and products all others contribute.<br><br>So, in short, we should attribute enthusiasm as a quality of life we acquire by our work. It&#39;s just an extra when you also find joy in your work itself, so when you don&#39;t that&#39;s not something that should drive you away from it, especially not in such fundamental building blocks of any profession as mathematics is. No profession only consists of steps you enjoy. <br><br>In that sense valid critic of the mathematical curriculum in schools could be, students are face learning far too detailed tools of problem analysis and too little about problem abstraction and creating models before they decide to specialize in a specific study at university or vocational training. But that reaches into the topic of education policies and what is considered common school education to start off with into any further education.", "comment_date": "2019-11-23T13:44:03Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Voiced Gaming", "comment_text": "Regarding looking up maths on something like Wikipedia, an alternative resource I&#39;ve used is MathWorld, which I&#39;ve described to friends as &quot;The Wikipedia of maths&quot;.

Your answers were quite entertaining &amp; enlightening! As for the teenager question, I (Speaking as a high school junior) tend to find the major math problem among teens is not such extreme hatred, but instead the question of why they have to take multiple years of math. Heard everyday in my pre-calculus class is the question of, &quot;What am I ever gonna use this for? I&#39;m not going to take calculus next year because it&#39;s stupid and I&#39;m never gonna use it.&quot; My usual response comes from personal experience as someone who does use math every single day. I always feel to respond with how mathematics can be used in any application any day. There is always a way to include mathematics. The example I give comes from a time I made lollipops myself, in my own kitchen. The recipe called for a quarter tablespoon of flavoring extract. My 1-tablespoon measuring spoon was in the shape of a hemisphere. A quarter of the height filled is not a quarter of the 1-tablespoon volume. I then asked myself what fill height corresponds to what volume. I integrated for the volume of a sphere cap and got to work. At this point, people look at me like I&#39;m crazy, but that isn&#39;t the point. Math at any level can be applied in any situation. Most jobs nowadays use mathematical modeling at some level, even if only basic functions. Higher math concepts can help to re-visit, re-derive, and make more efficient these methods. It doesn&#39;t even have to apply like that; calculus in the kitchen is legitimately a use of mathematics. Anyways, I&#39;m rambling, so I&#39;ll wrap up. My point is, I agree with your idea about introducing the everyday connection. Math can always be applied in the everyday; the only way it can&#39;t be applied is when you strongly avoid applying it.", "comment_date": "2019-11-23T04:41:44Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Lag Duck", "comment_text": "What a great person you are.
