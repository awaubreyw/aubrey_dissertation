This is the same notion as maintaining the scalar multiplication and vector addition properties in the definition of linear transformations i.e if x and y are vectors and c a scalar then T(cx) = cT(x) and T(x+y) = T(x)+T(y).

However, I must confess that having seen explanations such as yours, along with a few other math pursuits of mine over the past year, has made me somewhat provoked about the way math is generally taught in the US. I&#39;m 52 and currently have time to pursue some interests of mine for which I previously didn&#39;t have time. When I was young, I had a love/hate relationship with math. I was perplexed and annoyed with myself that I could often solve complicated problems (like in calculus, for example), but had so much trouble with more mundane ones (like logs). Well, I&#39;ve come to the realization that when I asked many teachers if they could explain how they solved certain problems, they answered merely by reiterating algorithms and mnemonics. Matrices have made this quite vivid. Though usually superb, Khan Academy left me very confused. I spent several dozen (yes!) frustrating hours trying to square matrix multiplication (the algorithm, that is) with linear transformations, and it wasn&#39;t until I finally used that method side-by-side with what you have so brilliantly taught here that I realized the mnemonic algorithm (for solving what x and y vectors become when i and j are transformed) of &quot;line/row&quot; is actually devoid of intuitive content. It&#39;s much like telling someone that the way to spell &quot;math&quot; is to &quot;place an h on the right, an ma on the left, and insert a t between the two.&quot; Sure, it comes out right at the end, but is contrived and doesn&#39;t help in understanding what is being spelled, or why - if that analogy makes any sense. I have had several other experiences - while relearning math I never fully understood - that have led me to believe that the reason I never fully understood some concepts is because they were never actually explained. Instead, in both high school and college, we were taught merely algorithms to churn out correct answers. I&#39;ve had conversations with others from the US and Canada who have expressed the same sentiment. Interestingly, on several occasions, Russians have expressed that their learning experience with math was quite different. Whatever the case, I find it ironic that it took not being in school to properly learn (and understand) a lot of math. Sorry to ramble for so long; I was interested to see if any others have had the same experience. I also want to reiterate my thanks for these lessons.

A linear transformation will flip the basis vectors/space (such that i hat will now be &quot;to the left of&quot; j hat) iff the 2nd coordinate of i hat and the 1st one of j hat (that left-right bottom-top diagonal) are both strictly greater than at least one of the other 2 remaining coordinates (the right-left-top-bottom diagonal). You can even define a flip that way in case you get confused by the visual. Try it out with all the examples, and use it to explain to yourself why the shear example didn&#39;t result in a flip: it&#39;s because the 2nd coordinate of i hat ofc can&#39;t overtake the 1st one, since neither change and it was 0 (which is &lt; 1) to begin with, and then it can&#39;t overtake the 2nd coordinate of j hat either so long as j hat stays within the positive (1st) quadrant, since that coordinate will just keep growing; and even if it goes to 0, it won&#39;t be strictly less than i-hat&#39;s 2nd coordinate until it goes into the 4th quadrant, at which point the basis vectors will flip in this example as long as the 1st coordinate of j hat stays positive (specifically, in this example, stays greater than the 2nd). Anyway, it&#39;s easier to just take the rule and apply it to the visuals yourself! And thinking about things yourself in this way instead of trying to interpret a wall of text is a much better way of internalizing these things.

Actually, we can look at the linear transformation from another different angle too, a passive way. For example, let&#39;s stop at <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kYB8IZa5AuE&amp;t=4m27s\">4:27</a> and look at the screenshot there. There are two different grid systems here: the regular square grid ---Let me call it Bob&#39;s grid; another grid system is the tilted larger grid ---Let me call it Rachel&#39;s grid. That yellow vector&#39;s coordinates are (5, 2)b and (-1, 2)r in Bob&#39;s grid system and Rachel&#39;s grid system respectively. Please note: it is the same vector. It has different coordinates with regards to two different reference systems. How do we convert from (-1, 2)r to (5, 2)b?  By the linear transformation.  The basis vectors in Rachel&#39;s grid are:  (1, 0)r=(1, -2)b   (0, 1)r=(3, 0)b  So matrix A=(1  3, -2  0)   det(A)=6.  The matrix A converts (-1, 2)r to (5, 2)b.  The inverse of A is: 1/6(0  -3, 2  1), which converts (5,  2)b to (-1,  2)r.  In conclusion, the linear transformation is converting the vector&#39;s coordinates from one grid system to another. The vector itself doesn&#39;t move or change at all. One analogy is: I walked 1 mile this morning, or 1.6 kilometer. The distance I walked this morning is fixed.

The same linear transformations can be applied to 3d space as well as 2d planes, and since there exists a transformation which, for every point in 3d space, would bring that point to the origin, that means that every point in space has a potential transformation  matrix that would overlap it with any, every, other point in space, simultaneously. To teleport we would just have to pick the transformation matrix that would align the 2 points. Of course, the actual doing is a feat of its own, but the thought is neat.

Thank you for making these. <br><br>Linear algebra entered my life as I started to try and learn about machine learning. A basic operation in artificial neural networks (large statistical models used for classification, prediction, and many other cool things) is s(W*x+b), where W is a matrix, x a vector (representing a particular data point), b a vector, and s the sigmoid function (a nonlinearity). You can imagine each data point x as part of a cloud of points which we want to tease apart according to some rule. I imagine the cloud of points being stretched, rotated, and skewed by W, though still remaining jumbled, then b shifting the transformed points. Finally the visual perspective also makes clear why adding a nonlinearity, which can bend and warp space, can be very helpful in separating points that would otherwise remain entangled. <br><br>Machine learning has made linear algebra, calculus, and other mathematical concepts come alive for me.
