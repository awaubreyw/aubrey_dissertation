[{"comment_by": "3Blue1Brown", "comment_text": "Some added notes (copied from the pinned commend to the next video):<br><br>1) Some people have asked about if the tan(x) \u2248 x approximation, being off by only a cubic error term, is actually close enough not to affect the final count.  It&#39;s actually a very interesting answer!  I really went back and forth on whether or not to include this in the video but decided to leave it out to better keep things to the point.  This difference between arctan(x) and x could be problematic for our final count if, at some point when you&#39;re looking at the first 2n digits of pi, the last n of them are all 9&#39;s.  It seems exceedingly unlikely that this should be true.  For example, among the first 100 million digits of pi, the maximal sequence of consecutive 9&#39;s has length 8, whereas you&#39;d need a sequence of 50 million for things to break our count!  Nevertheless, this is quite difficult to prove, related to the question of whether or not pi is a &quot;normal&quot; number, roughly meaning that it&#39;s digits behave like a random sequence.  It was left as a conjecture in Galperin&#39;s paper on the topic.  See sections 9 and 10 of that paper (linked in the description) for more details.<br><br>2) A word on terminology:  I tend to use the word \u201cphase space\u201d to describe any space like the ones described in this video and the last, encoding some state of some system.  You should know, though, that often in the context of mechanics, this term is reserved for the special case of a space which encodes both the positions and the momenta of all the objects involved.  For example, in that setting, the \u201cphase space\u201d here would be four-dimensional, where the four coordinates represent the position and momentum of each pair of blocks.  The term \u201cconfiguration space\u201d, in contrast, just refers to one where the coordinates describe the positions of all the objects involved, which is what we do next video.", "comment_date": "2019-02-09T02:01:39Z", "likes_count": 2009}, {"comment_by": "Glitcher1", "comment_text": "i would love school if it was like this", "comment_date": "2022-08-18T03:06:15Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Travis Carlisle", "comment_text": "Is there a simulator that I can use to simulate this with?", "comment_date": "2022-08-15T20:06:33Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Darcy Whyte", "comment_text": "My brain fell off.", "comment_date": "2022-08-14T15:13:03Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Ravi Vadali", "comment_text": "A proof that math is beautiful !", "comment_date": "2022-08-14T03:07:03Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "valiant", "comment_text": "this is fucking fascinating. as a physics + maths student this is so exciting and also way beyond what I could do atm. but explained SO well. :)", "comment_date": "2022-08-13T23:08:28Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "\u1107\u110c\u1112\uc790\ub77c\ub098\ub77c \uba38\ub9ac\uba38\ub9ac", "comment_text": "\uc601\uc7ac\uace0 2\ucc28 \uc804\ub0a0\ubc24\uc5d0 \uc774\uac70\ubcf4\uace0 \ub5a8\uc5b4\uc84c\ub294\ub370 \ub2e4\uc2dc\ubcf4\ub2c8\uae50 \uc7ac\ubc0c\uc5b4\uc11c \ud6c4\ud68c\ub294 \uc548\ub428", "comment_date": "2022-08-07T13:00:49Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "123Maths School", "comment_text": "I didn&#39;t understand the concept but I liked the sound when those two blocks collided tr trr trrr trrrr trrrr ttttttt", "comment_date": "2022-08-06T14:32:01Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "JupiterGD", "comment_text": "I\u2019m waiting for him to talk about burning cheesecakes in calorimetry.

I only know about its German term, but I guess it is called the couchproblem.

I could just evade the angle of the L in the direction it came from until it is through, which would take an infinite amount of time. I would bump into the corner pi times I guess ;) This only shows that the perfect circle like the dot is a mathematical construct, an ideal, that is actually not found in its definition in physics. We in that regard tend to apply pi on circles, which actually are only an idealization of roundness, which reflects on the shore paradox (or what it is called anyway): the more exactly you measure, the longer the shore becomes...", "comment_date": "2021-06-23T00:23:55Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "yoav ba", "comment_text": "wow!<br>by the way, what tool do you use to simulate and animate those topics?

We can look up at their king that governs them by its own rules - entropy. We can see it from perspective that each collision is happening at special critical points when entropy falls down under some boundary limit and it happens to correct behaviour of the system in order to decrease concentration of density of information at some points / intervals which is equivalent to increasing entropy. So that each collision demonstrates local minima of entropy, something like quantized states and when no collisions are possible to happen, we reach the continuous states of increasing entropy with time in the best way - it is corresponding to minimizing functional of action what we know from theoretical mechanics. Then there is some parallelism between description of system by collisions or by energy levels that happens for particle in potential hole.

Hmm... Fun to consider.  <br>Further simplification by only counting collisions until the larger mass velocity changes direction/sign or is 0.

And also found it was computationally useless as a method of easily calculating pi. What I got was this (reading off the little scrap of paper I wrote it on): So if you start with mass m moving to the left at speed v2, and mass 1 moving to the right at speed v1. So ostensibly m is some large integer power of 10 the way you presented it. And with simple physics where kinetic energy and momentum are non-relativistic and conserved, I got that it results in the mass 1 moving to the left (assumed, but on the last bounce it could be going to the right) at speed u1=(2*m*v2+(m-1)*v1)/(m+1) and the mass m still moving to the left (assumed, but of course eventually it turns around) at speed u2=((m-1)*v2-2*v1)/(m+1). Now you can see that this is just defined by a 2x2 matrix from R2 onto R2 which represents a change in magnitude and a rotation. The m+1 in the denominator doesn&#39;t MATTER, it just changes the magnitude since it is the case for BOTH of them, so you can leave that out. Remember u2 is negated when it hits the wall at x=0. And you are left with just the 2x2 matrix:<br>[  m-1         2m<br>    -2           m-1]<br><br>Which for large m, is APPROXIMATELY:<br>[1     2<br>0      1]<br><br>Which unfortunately isn&#39;t really a very well conditioned matrix. But it&#39;s not REALLY bad. Nevertheless, for a LARGE number of iterations, this APPROXIMATION isn&#39;t good enough and precision is REALLY the key.<br><br>And so the question is, when you ITERATE this, i.e. you take this matrix to a high POWER, at what point does the ANGLE SHIFT of the original vector of [0 1] (the mass of 1 motionless and the mass m moving to the left at velocity 1, it doesn&#39;t matter what it is as long as it is something) get past 90 degrees (that&#39;s the point where the mass m changes direction - you might as well just find the point where it changes direction and assume that to be the halfway point)? Well if you were just using the 2nd thing, the approximation, it would NEVER happen, it would NEVER get to 90 degrees (this shouldn&#39;t be a big surprise as it means m is infinite and the mass 1 can&#39;t affect its velocity by impacting it, so it would just turn the 0 1 vector into 2 1 and then 3 1 and then 4 1 and then 5 1 and just keep going like that). Each time you&#39;re just doing this transformation, pretty soon you&#39;re just going to be doing a very slight angle shift as it just gets closer and closer and closer to being the eigenvector on [1 0], however if you stop using the APPROXIMATION, the eigenvector won&#39;t be exactly [1 0] but SLIGHTLY past that, so that it eventually crosses the 90 degree shift point but also important is that it&#39;s numerically going to be really LOUSY and the errors will add up if you try to use the method where you take the matrix to a high power.<br><br>It&#39;s not really a good way of finding pi then.", "comment_date": "2019-01-20T21:52:54Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Vineet Kumar", "comment_text": "Best YouTube of this generation so far!

Put in whatever masses you what and round down and you get the number of bounces. But why? This total area is defined as the (area of 1 wedge) * (the number of wedges that fit). But I would have thought the number of wedges that fit would equal the number of bounces, not the total area of the ellipse. So it must be true that the number of wedges of angle=2(theta) that fit in the ellipse is equal to the area, but why? What about the construction of this phase diagram makes that true.  Further, I feel like you should be able to show this at least geometrically without calculating theta, but maybe my intuition is wrong about that. And a geometrical argument for the area being the number of bounces is what I&#39;m really after.

They didn&#39;t give an explanation on why this happens, and they said that &quot;it has nothing to do with circles&quot; (but 3Brown1Blue always finds a way to relate ANYTHING with Pi with a circle). However, what called my attention is that, while 3Brown1Blue presents a solution that works ONLY if the big mass is 100^N times the smaller mass, the Numberphile video (based on the same paper) says that it works ONLY if the big mass is 16 times 100^N times the smaller mass. So when starting with N=0, Numberphile gets a big mass of 16 times the smaller one to get the 1st digit of Pi: 3. While 3Brown1Blue gets 1 (m1=m2) to get the same first digit 3. Another difference (that I thought explained it all) was the Numberphile is counting ONLY the impacts between the 2 masses, while 3Brown1Blue is counting both the impacts between the 2 masses and between the small mass and the wall. And, finally, the last difference is that 3Brown1Blue is counting until no more impacts are possible, while Numberphile is counting the number of block to block impacts until the big block stops advancing towards the wall (there can and will be more impacts after that) I also could not help but notice that, in this 3Brown1Blue video, the first set up shown has a big mass 16 times the small mass. I counted the collisions between the blocks only and only until the big block stops making progress towards the wall, and it is 3 indeed (1st digit of Pi). SO WHAT ON EARTH IS GOING ON HERE?????

There are three collisions, with the last leaving one block stationary. On the diagram, this would look like a 45 degree line, one vertical &#39;jump&#39;, then one more line ending on the x axis at exactly (1,0). The lines are 45 degrees because the blocks&#39; masses, and therefore the rise and run, are both equal. The arctan of a 1/1 slope is exactly equal to pi/4. Thus, the maximum integer in the case of equal block mass can actually be 4 while still not being <b>above</b> pi- just equal to it. Thinking back to the diagram, what would a 4th collision even look like? If the 3rd line is diagonal and lands on (1,0), the next line would be a &#39;jump&#39;, or reflection, across the x axis...

In a &#39;1/0 = infinity&#39; kind of way, there &#39;would&#39; be another collision &#39;after infinite time&#39;, but just how 1/0 does not equal infinity, there&#39;s never another collision because the block isn&#39;t moving.", "comment_date": "2019-01-20T18:15:42Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Pathagas", "comment_text": "I would love to see a graph of how much the collisions/second changes over time.", "comment_date": "2019-01-20T18:15:39Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Tapabrata Mukherjee", "comment_text": "First liked the video, and then started watching.", "comment_date": "2019-01-20T18:15:30Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Viola Buddy", "comment_text": "<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsYwFizhncE&amp;t=12m43s\">12:43</a> &quot;The error between the actual value of arctan(1/100) and the approximation of 0.01 just won&#39;t have a change to accumulate high enough to be as big as an integer.&quot;<br><br>This kind of bothers me.
