You are using the prime number theory, that says N/ln(N) is the asymptotic number of primes up to N.

To start with, there was the question of what a number raised to the power of x meant if that number happened to be irrational e.g 2 raised to the power of sqrt(3). Powers made sense when the numbers were rational but you had to go around that for irrational numbers - and it was typically assumed that we could approximate irrational numbers as rational and hence you could get a reasonable enough value for that exponent. This is to say exponentiation was continuous over the reals. But how such an assumption came to be was often overlooked. So instead of starting with exponents, the lecturer started by defining ln(a) as the area under the y=1/x from 1 to a. Since this area function is continuous, then we can start playing with some interesting properties of such a function and show that it satisfies our logarithm laws, where it is eventually revealed this function has an inverse which is none other than exp(x).", "comment_date": "2020-05-10T03:38:33Z", "likes_count": 6}, {"comment_by": "Matmagix", "comment_text": "I saw the gorilla!", "comment_date": "2020-05-10T02:55:00Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Dean Calhoun", "comment_text": "please talk more about primes (and maybe more number theory in general?) because that topic is so so interesting", "comment_date": "2020-05-10T02:37:44Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "gidi", "comment_text": "Does the video jump at 27?

And this is why I find math to be so expressive! You can see it on paper but you can most definitely hear it in the awe of music! I played the trumpet for over 10 years when I was in school so I understand music, musical notation, etc. as I can read and play sheet music for that instrument. And since sine and cosine are wave functions and we use them to graph and map objects in nature that have waveforms such as energy, sound, light and more... we can express what we hear in music not only in a score or in terms of sheet music, but also in beautifully written summations of integrals and derivatives of sine and cosine wave functions expressed as geometrical polynomials such that you would see in different types of series such as Taylor Series, Laplace Transforms, Lorenze, Eulers, and FFTs. If you ever stop to read and break down the file structure of MIDI files, you&#39;ll begin to understand the power of mathematics to express the world - environment around us. Physics and Math are embedded within Energy, Mass, and Matter through motion and they are constructed on the simple principles of mathematics. For me, it is this duality that drives the COSMOS as they are the self-perpetuating engine! This is coming from the Mathematic - Physics - Chemistry perspective of the physical world.  <br><br>Now as for the Spiritual side of things, I like to make the connection between everything above from basic addition (1+1) = 2 which generates the unit circle located at the point (1,0) on the XY-plane, and once you have the unit circle, you have every other function such as multiplication, powers their inverses, logarithms, constants such as PI and e, the trig functions and all of their properties and so much more... And since I&#39;ve already stated that we use the cosine and sine functions to map the behavior of things that act, operate, or have the properties of being rotational, oscillatory, repeating, recurring, sinusoidal, periodic, etc... I like to make the connection with all of mathematics, physics, chemistry even concepts in biology and general engineering and that of Genesis Chapter 1 verses 1-5 but most specifically verses 1-3.<br><br>The more I study physics, chemistry, biology, and the complexity of nature and the physical world around us there is 0 doubt in my mind, conscience, heart, and soul that there is Intelligent Design Written all over everything we observe, witness and experience. To this degree, I make the statement and claim that everything we experience and witness is a product primarily of Sound and Light. These are two of the 5 most basic senses that we possess. The other 3 are touch, smell, and taste. Our vision comes from light, our hearing from sound, but as for our sense of touch, it is a combination of both. We feel the vibrations of things moving, friction, change in energy and temperature, textures between different states of matter, and so on. Now as for smell and taste they are related as they come from the product of chemical reactions, the aromas produced in the form of heat. We know through physics from Newton that F = ma and through Einstein that E = mC^2. We know that matter and energy can not be created nor destroyed... Sound and Light are Energy and their waveforms are governed by the properties of the Trigonometric Functions which are defined by Triangles and Circles. We can rewrite m as m = F/a and we can substitute that into Einstein&#39;s equation to get E = (F/a)*C^2 we can do the reverse and state that m = E/C^2 and put that into Newton&#39;s equation F = (E/C^2)*a  if we look at E and F we can see that there is something that is common between both of them... E = (F*C^2)/(a)  and F = (E*a)/(C^2)  the have in common the acceleration of an object and the area of light in a given time frame. Don&#39;t think of C^2 as being velocity or the speed at which light travels in these equations as that would be misleading. Think of C^2 as C being the distanced traveled within that time frame (typically in physics the standard time for velocity and acceleration is m/s and m/s^2. So you have to as yourself what is the distance that light travels in 1 second. Take that distance and square it. This gives you an area. This area and the amount of acceleration an object have determines the amount of energy that is within that object and the forces that are being applied to it. If you take a look at the scale or octaves of music and you look at the color spectrum of light as octaves you will see that there are parallels between them, yes they have a different frequency range, but there is a mapping between specific colors and specific sounds or notes if you care to examine them close enough.  There are no mistakes in these concepts. <br><br>So when I go back and read Genesis and make the connections. It&#39;s quite simple to see that when God said, &quot;Let there be light&quot; and it was so... It was his voice that shook the heavens and it was the sound of his voice that brought light into existence and from there the Cosmos was born. I believe that Sound and Light drive everything to move and that we are a part of their products! So when God said, Let there be Light... He painted the Universe with his Song and Poetry because Music is Colorful! Don&#39;t think of this as me trying to preach as that&#39;s not what this is about. I&#39;m only stating the connections that I see and what I believe in. I just share what I know and understand and from there, it&#39;s up to the reader to do what they want and what they will with it. I believe in and support Free Will, so I say, take the information and make up your own damned mind about it! Yet, I will still argue and debate my position based on my knowledge, and the ability too understanding, ability to see patterns and to make the connections between them.  If we consider the fact that the very first geometrical shape that has a defined area and three interior angles that add up to 180 degrees or PI radians from 3 intersecting line segments that can be expressed in the form of y = mx + b where we would have three different lines: y1 = m1x1 + b1, y2 = m2x2 + b2, and y3 = m3x3 + b3 and understand that from this Triangle we can define the sine wave that is used to map sound and light waves is no coincidence, just consider the Trinity as in the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit with the understanding that they are 3 different parts but are all one and the same such as the properties of a triangle with 3 different vertices and 3 different angles yet giving you a solid geometrical shape with a defined area! At the same time, knowing that the sound of his voice drives everything into motion including light is the E in Einstein&#39;s equation, and the Area of light is bounded by a 45-degree right triangle that is reflected over its hypotenuse. This is why the Pythagorean Theorem and the Equation of a Circle are basically one and the same and this is also why the Trig functions have an Identity - Property that involves the Pythagorean Theorem. The complex numbers are more real than you can imagine including concepts such as infinity because of the ability to create which is no different than the ability to count, compute, or enumerate...  When you can take the expression (1+1) and generate 2. That is being Creative! According to his words, we are created in his image therefore we are creative beings! This is why we are able to understand and to do discover and invent the concepts you find within mathematics, physics, and chemistry. <br><br>We are creative, and because of that, we can make something that once didn&#39;t exist to now exist and we see this all the time throughout the course of history within mathematics, physics, chemistry, biology, and engineering. We possess and inherit all of his traits! This is why I love numbers, mathematics, physics, and equations, they do not lie, and when you study them enough and begin to truly understand all of their connections is when you will be able to open your eyes and see what I see, that there is Intelligent Design Written all over Creation! I don&#39;t believe that we are here from some spontaneous random chance explosion! I believe we are here due to an intentional perfectly planned explosion! Did the Big bang happen? Yes, it did! Is it the reason why everything is here? Directly, no. Indirectly, yes. Directly it is not responsible for everything. Indirectly it is what propelled everything into existence. You see, there are cause and effect. The big bang was the effect and not the cause! The cause of it all is from Sound a voice Shouting: &quot;Let there be Light!&quot;.", "comment_date": "2020-05-09T03:58:10Z", "likes_count": 2}, {"comment_by": "theosib", "comment_text": "I did see the gorilla suit.", "comment_date": "2020-05-09T03:43:40Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Jumpy the Hat", "comment_text": "OK but why gorilla though", "comment_date": "2020-05-09T03:41:33Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Hexed Decimals", "comment_text": "I think Grant&#39;s little tirade against e goes to show that e&#39;s superpower is facilitating simplicity.
