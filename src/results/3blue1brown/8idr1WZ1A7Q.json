I was added to the IQ baseline reference group by the Tavistock Clinic during the extension of IQ testing to kids in the 60s, but they never told me why they were so interested. My only takeaway was that I could never test again, which is normal maths, it results in an indeterminate calculation (the denominator is the product of the difference between the test subject and every member of the baseline group, so Me-Me=0 wipes out the rest). That&#39;s fair for a can of beans, not so for a human being, however much they resemble Mr Bean. He&#39;s funny because he&#39;s not neurotypical, and that&#39;s pure prejudice, in passing. I was born the way I am. The medics had a duty to tell me of their findings, but were so excited by me turning up by accident in a valid baseline cohort they likely forgot. Must have been like finding a mermaid in the catch of a North Sea trawler!<br>When some really high performer comes along, similar issues appear: they have no measure to be compared to, so either they&#39;re given 163, the top marker, or an imputation&#39;s made, which isn&#39;t objective. I know my original score now, because you decline as you age: Me(60) &lt; Me(12), so I could test, scoring 153-4, implying mid-160s at peak. So, who&#39;s in that bracket in the group I&#39;m part of? As you&#39;d expect, not many, just 2, both 163: I wonder who the first one was? So statistically, nobody was smarter, in reality, maybe a dozen were. It&#39;s an approximation. Is there corroboration? Yes, the team I was part of won the 2012 Nobel Peace Prize. I wasn&#39;t a spear-carrier, either, the major reason given was my work, recognised when I was detailed off to welcome the Eastern European diplomats on the first morning on their pathway into Europe - I&#39;d given the heads-up on the imminent implosion of the Iron Curtain. Also, the only hard data I had from the Tavistock allows me to perform the pre-Binet calculation, based on the General Knowledge test used in the cohort acceptance profiling: I scored GK14 aged 8y6m, 14/8.5=165%. I&#39;m not the first in the family to have been on a Nobel Prize team, either.<br>My CV isn&#39;t credible as a result. Tough. I&#39;ve done things of legend, made things happen which didn&#39;t happen of their own accord. Led the team which restabilised the Albanian economy after the pyramid banking crash in 1997, done the pathfinding to Malta&#39;s accession to the EU, completed Gandhi&#39;s work, and much more. I don&#39;t claim the credit, because my diagnosis includes observed hyperperception, I&#39;m a seer medium, whih means I credit the Almighty, it being very hard not to score when all the opposition&#39;s been cleared out of the way for you! That too affects the statistics, having a thumb on the scales. As the Koestler Institute&#39;s discovered, it&#39;s not a constant, so can&#39;t be factored into the equations, with the possible extension of the probability of the improbable implicit in the Poisson distribution as an influence on cusp events in chaos theory forming an exception.

An idea: Most college students who took a non-STEM stats 101 course already know what confidence intervals are, at least asymptotically.

Not to mention how these days reviews are always vetted / censored in order to prevent review bombing and such.

Also, niche customers might review the product first and rate it highly, but a broader audience might later review it with lower ratings. For example, many well liked comedy and horror films receive low film critic scores, even if horror or comedy fans strongly like them. Also many niche video games score highly, but large releases often receive much more mixed ratings.

Years ago, probably a decade at least, I read a simple article about how to build an email spam filter using Bayesian statistics.  It seemed pretty straightforward, taking the different words and other information that comes with an email (header information), looking at how often those &#39;terms&#39; appear in both spam and non-spam (typically called ham) emails to learn the prior probabilities, then using that you can evaluate incoming emails to give it a likelihood of being spam score.  I wanted to be able to categorize a large collection of ebooks I had based on their topic, like math, biology, computer science, etc, so I extended it just a bit to get probability scores for being in each category.  After feeding it only a few books of each category, it got very good at guessing the category of the books.<br><br><br>Review systems online are a very complicated problem, because all of the existing ones are actively gamed.  Any sort of &#39;rating&#39; or &#39;evaluation&#39; online is.  I&#39;ve always wondered why they treat reviews in a sort of &#39;all reviews are created equal&#39; sort of way.  If I am looking to buy a book, and I have reviewed/rated a bunch of other books I have previously read, it would seem to me that if the system were setup to heavily weight reviews posted by other people whose reviews of other books most closely matched my own ratings, it would insulate it against gaming.  10,000 glowing reviews written by people who are gigantic fans of books I hate are worth less than a single positive review by someone whose tastes line up closely with my own.  But existing review systems don&#39;t tend to treat reviews that way at all.  Netflixs recommendation system does, and it is remarkably accurate as a result, but it&#39;s in a bit of a different context.

If they are issues I find inconsequential to me, such as slow shipping or, in the case of used products (say, books) then slight imperfections may not matter. In other words, if they are based on unmet, unrealistic expectations, I don&#39;t pay them any attention. But, if they have to do with product operation, quality or bait &amp; switch, I choose another vendor. Especially when there is no public response from the original supplier. I give starting companies with low reviews a chance if they have no serious infractions. Everybody needs to start somewhere and the practice of only buying from sellers with a lot of reviews only encourages false reviews. Another tactic I employ before buying from a newbie is to ask a prepurchase question (doesn&#39;t matter what the question is about, the more mundanne is probably better) and use the speed and thoughtfulness of response to help me gauge the likelihood of a good overall transaction. If the seller is really slow, unapologetic, and especially curt in their response, I&#39;ll pass. I figure I&#39;ve given you an opportunity normally not available to online suppliers (the opportunity to interact with your customer) and you&#39;ve taken the single most desired aspect of sales and thrown it in my face, then you don&#39;t deserve my business. Sellers, remember: buyers ALWAYS have a choice. Always. If you want their business, act like it at every point of the transaction. Want to know the best way to communicate with customers? Go wait tables in a decent restaurant for a while. There is no better, immediate, and measurable response to your service and communication skills than the tips you receive. In my youth, I knew many servers who blamed their shitty tips on shitty customers (and that happens, for sure) but if they&#39;re ALL shitty tips, it&#39;s not the customers. You&#39;d be surprised how much difference just the genuine willingness to make a good experience for the customer can vastly improve their impression of you, even when stuff beyond your control goes wrong.

This is especially true for misguided students, who mistakenly buy an advanced math book for graduates, rather for beginners. Or machine learning coders, who are just looking for coding books, rather than the real math behind machine learning. A third type of review is about the quality and delivery. When I look for reviews, I am mostly interested about the content and quality, not that you had a bad time with delivery, or because you can&#39;t do basic research about the shit you&#39;re planning to buy.
