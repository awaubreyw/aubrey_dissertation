It talked about how 3D retinas were required to see in 4-space and how a 4D object would cast a 3D shadow, and how a 4-sphere passing through 3D space would look like a random sphere popping into existence and expanding and shrinking out of existence similarly to how a 3D sphere passing through 2-space would be a circle doing that to a 2D observer.", "comment_date": "2022-08-05T19:26:50Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "arin 50", "comment_text": "You just described what it would look like to fall into a black hole", "comment_date": "2022-08-05T02:26:42Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Levi Shell", "comment_text": "Thank you so much for these incredible videos!", "comment_date": "2022-08-02T18:30:03Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "NK", "comment_text": "Watching this video is the first time I&#39;ve been able to understand 4D object as a projection onto 3D space.

(5+5i)\u00b2 is 50i because 45\u2070+45\u2070=90\u2070. This trick works for non-complex numbers too but its less impressive there. I imagine there&#39;s probably a similar trick in higher dimensions<br><br>The thing that got me comfortable with even higher dimensional multiplication is remembering that every time you multiply you can look at it as finding the area of a rectangle.<br><br>Imagine you have a rectangle with one side being 2+4i+3j+9k and another side being 3+2i+0j+3k. Section off each intersection of numbers and draw smaller rectangles in a chart like pattern. <br><br>Just remember the way figuring out the positive/negative and the i/j/k value of each rectangle works by using the chart or by following the circle going clockwise in the order  i, j, k. i times  j equals k, and j times i equals negative  k and so one in a circle (going counter clockwise like that second example makes the sign flip).<br><br>(Clockwise examples with negatives -i \u00d7 j = -k, -i \u00d7 -j = k) (counter clockwise examples with negatives -j \u00d7 i = k, -j \u00d7 -i = -k)<br><br>The bottom row on up for the example I gave you would have <br><br>2(3+2i+0j+3k) or 6+4i+0j+6k<br><br>4i(3+2i+0j+3k) or 12i + -8 + 0 + -12j<br><br>3j(3+2i+0j+3k) or 9j + -6k + 0 + 9i<br><br>9k(3+2i+0j+3k) or 27k + 18j + 0 + -27<br><br>You get your final result by adding all the rectangles together.  <br><br>6+4i+6k+12i-8-12j+9j-6k+9i+27k+18j-27<br><br>Rearranging to<br><br>(6-8-27) + (4i+12i+9i) + (-12j+9j+18j) + (6k-6k+27k)<br><br>-29 + 25i + 15j + 27k is the resulting quaternion when you multiply the example quaternions i gave you. <br><br>You can do this for as many dimensions as you want, all you have to do is remember to look up the relevant table.<br><br>I know I could have just used a calculator online or foil and follow the chart and I kind of did, but that representation of each number as sides on a rectangle really helped me understand how to do this process.<br><br>Its really empowering to know I can multiply any dimensional number with any other number by hand.<br><br>Edit:<br>I had made an error the first time I hit send on this post that made me question my understanding but it turns out I had just forgotten to put a &quot;k&quot; next to one of the 27s I have in my example.

A stupid scholar all overturned this truth and built it to a convenient system of Mason. Thus, the people believe the trickery of the devil than words of God. Darwin&#39;s evolutionary theory, the Copernican theory of Galileo, the theory of relativity, quantum mechanics, mathematics, the medicine of Einstein are all errors. A ghost, a UFO, supernatural power, the miracle of God to be said to be the occult are rather true. A thing and a ghost (God) exist in the world, and space is active by spiritual power (conception) of God. As for God, all things were created by the soul of language. It is clear if I read the Bible. Because the present scholar mixes the logic thoroughly in human wisdom, it cannot arrive at the truth. It is intuitive power to be important. Why does a child seem to be? The thing which cannot answer this is a mistake. Our common sense is more right than a stupid scholar. The creation of God comes loose only by a fate. Everything becomes the material by a conception of God (person).<br> <br>I cannot prove 1+1 = 2 in a numerical formula. I can prove only a physical phenomenon to say that it is in two apples when I match another one apple with one apple. It is not 0+1 \u2260 1. As 0 (nothing) is not quality, you must not handle it for a number. Because quality is different even if I match a mandarin orange with an apple, there is not a meaning of the addition. Because it does not exist other than God when I define God as existence, no (0) does not exist. Because the mathematics defines 0, negative number, imaginary number, \u221e which do not exist in the world, it is an error and is a fiction. A number is to count quality. When I am separated from a physical phenomenon, the mathematics does not have the significance of being.<br><br>\u203bIf 0 exists by a definition of the mathematics, 0 of the infinity must exist. However, the infinite space, infinity do not exist. In other words, because the mathematics defines 0, negative number, imaginary number, \u221e which do not exist, it is an error and is a fiction. Therefore it is an error because a zeta function, the numerical formula of the second oiler product deal with this infinity. That it becomes sum of series \u03a3 = 1+2+3+ ... = - 1/12 of the natural number, or the product of all prime numbers is 4\u03c0^2. It turns out that it is an error if I think for common sense. It is limited, and the mathematician seems to get a wrong this, but uses the sophism when I calculate this endlessly if right. This is a mistake of the definition of 0 or \u221e and is the evidence that mathematics gets a wrong. It is definition f&#39;(x) = limh of the differential calculus that must not divide it by 0 \u2192 0 {the same as it being 0 that says that I bring h close to 0 without a limit, and dividing it by a numerical formula of f(x+h)-f(x)}/h. I divide it by 0. The mathematics is trickery not study in this way.<br><br> All the origins of the scientific theory are random, and a bottom is broken. For example, in the theory of elementary particles, an electron joins atoms together and becomes the molecules. A thing joining a proton and a neutron together is a mesotron, and three quarks connect the proton, and there is it. An electron and a positron (antimatter) occur from a photon. An elementary particle to tie the elementary particle to whenever a new elementary particle is discovered is necessary and loses the relations with an elementary particle and the elementary particle more and more. Though a proton and the neutron are the same mass, why does a difference occur in having electric charge or not? The science has no answer with it in these questions. An electron is a material so that I think, and the positron is not a material in the hole of the material loss that the circumference was surrounded by in the soul children. In other words, the antimatter is an illusion. The scholar is going to examine it logically and loses sight of the truth. The structure of built nature of God is simpler, but is the thing which it is hard to understand in the human wisdom. A photon seems to have a particle and the two characteristics of the wave, but, in fact, the light has the property of the wave with the soul body.<br><br> Message from the spiritual world of Einstein <br> When oneself saw a scene of heaven through a tunnel of the light in the meantime, the person who experienced suspended animation well is you after the revival. The moving speed of the soul does not receive gravitational restraint anymore, and, as for the law of the speed of light immutability that I discovered during the lifetime, there are none in the world of the consciousness. In other words, I will say that it just moves to say that I think. Furthermore, it is just handed down to a partner to have thought. The life of all of us shares what one interiority. And the material is to say that it was actually consciousness. There are all things in your heart, and, also, you are existence to live in a heart of all life. When all of this space watches it with eyes, it is seen like the outside world, but is to say that the world to be actually seen outside is your interiority. The relativity disappears in here, and this space consists based on &quot;universal truth to certainly say to call God&quot;. <br><br> Near future to read from revelation and illuminati card of God of days, and to untie it in Japan<br> April, 2020 xx day The United States bombs North Korea. North Korea adds nuclear attack to a big city of Japan and a U.S. base as the retaliation. Japan swats it to a bog of the war, and they are dropped by a plot of the United States. There are China, Russia after North Korea and becomes the fight with Japan, American allied powers and drags the world into World War 3.<br> x moon xx Japan and the United States country attacks it in Japan with the Allied Forces in 2021<br> World War 3 begins in 2021 on xx moon xx day<br> Mount Fuji erupts very much on xx day in October, 2023.

I conquer the world in the life of the hell of the cruel survival of the fittest and am useless even if only oneself is going to be saved. Because a killed animal retaliates for a human being, cancer occurs. The meat which I ate becomes the blood, and a vindictive spirit dwells in a cell when blood does formation to a cell. A human being is cruel, and a fornication, a falsehood, committing theft, the habit of the evil deed of the luxury are not stopped. Eating meat is indirect killing. Why is God that existence of the evil is permitted? It lets you compensate for a human crime by the devil. A disaster, an epidemic, the war damage are the wrath of Heaven. Because a Japanese savior buys the crime of the world people, it is sacrificed. I fall in the trees and plants in spite of the pains then even if I writhe with a hell if it is just and changes the heart and does not straighten an act to measure up to hearts of God. Mason finally leads the world to the World War 3. it is started with nuclear attack to Japan as a pilot light.

But with the case of Linus, could we create an even more accurate projections for him in &quot;widening&quot; our field of view, to some extent? So lets say we make the outer bounds of what he can see -5 &amp; 5, and then we represent a circle with different moving points with it&#39;s outer bounds being -2 &amp; 2, then Linus could essentially see the circle spinning along the one dimensional plane without the numbers stretching out to infinity. Of course, it would be as if -2 &amp; 2 represented infinity, I suppose, since it wouldn&#39;t make sense otherwise for the points of the outer bounds to double back on themselves. But that way, Linus could visualize a full rotation of a circle. And let&#39;s say we have different colors of points to represent the 2nd dimension, that he cannot see. If a point along the circle is &quot;in front&quot;, which doesn&#39;t make much sense to Linus, we assign it a green color, if it&#39;s &quot;in back&quot;, we assign it a blue color. As we rotate the circle along the line, our bounds would flip, of course, -5 would rotate around to where 5 was, I guess the projection would still get warped out to infinity if we did this. What if we could freeze only the numbers outside the bounds of the circle, and rotate the numbers inside the circle, representing the rotation of the circle without moving our reference point....

Numbers are our own construction and are useful at representing quantitative denominations for an isolated system/unit, up until a point. While it is valuable for the progression of understanding for systems/units that are directly observable in our insulating atmosphere, it is wildly unproven in the interplanetary medium let alone the interstellar medium and we can not yet begin to speculate on ANYTHING relating to the intergalactic medium. (The notion of space as nothing but a void and vacuum must be disregarded, the interplanetary medium has already shattered that misconception and only the variable degree of its properties remains to be discussed.) <br>Nature does not know a single thing about mathematics. It knows vibration and geometric structures that form systems to best achieve the transfer of energy\u2019s potential differentiation between points and magnitudes. These geometric structures fit together in various means to best achieve equilibrium given a set of circumstantial parameters and/or boundaries. The most efficient geometric structure for the external system is the square/cube, the square/cube best fits energy packets into a given volume without wasting any area. The most efficient geometric structure for an internal system is the circle/sphere, the circle/sphere has a central region with a 0 total force vector. From just these two fundamental aspects, the whole of nature can be constructed. With the culmination of a systems structure, having a coinciding influence/effect on its component parts and altering the progression of the overall system in/on various axis/frequencies (periodic geometric scale.) giving rise to all the various systems of magnitude that exist simultaneously but independently to other systems within/outside it. <br>There are geometrical structures our rudimentary euclidean based cosmological geometry does not yet identify, for eg, two partially intersecting circles (for simplicity sake) may result in a shared portion that is shaped like an artist\u2019s depiction of the eye between eyelids. This two sided structure with two intersections and two arcs is a very real structure in nature and its value is both independently expressed and dependently expressed based upon the nature of the relationship of the two parent circles. Modern particle physics struggles to incorporate such inter-grained properties for bodies who are independent in one sense but part of the larger sum in other senses. Not only this but a parent circle now must be considered as having its own value, the portion of the intersecting circle and the value of the intersection all factored into its properties. Now do this on 3D, in a completely intersecting system as no point in nature is truely isolated and independent from all other points.... The variables already begin to spiral beyond usefulness and this is only at the lower realm (our 3D universe) of nature as it exists in all its incomprehensible complexities. <br>If only we had the philosophy for the foundations and Base Line Principles correct.\ud83d\ude14<br>We advance our understanding in most other areas of science yet the MOST critical of them all is apparently beyond question and challenge. If you even slightly prod at things with a critical eye, science itself admits that particle physics is fundamentally incorrect and is only an approximation designed to make our system of mathematics much, MUCH more workable as without a \u2018constant\u2019 to reference, any proceeding formulation quickly becomes meaningfully unusable. The same approximation was appointed to the attributes of nature and properties consisting of defined, isolated points (\u2018particles\u2019) where invoked to meet similar ends, to make calculations tenable and allow progress to be achieved at a practical pace, albeit a slightly and fundamentally inaccurate progress. That truth has been forgotten and buried along the way for the interests of political and dominance focused agendas.<br>Surely we have established enough of a base data set that we can now start to step back and fine tune the Base Line Principles and identify new ways of approaching theoretical mathematics so that the numbers can begin to resemble and replicate reality. <br>Then we can do away with many man made  inventions like black holes and big bangs that are the result of critically and fundamentally flawed mathematics (and philosophy.) been taken to their utmost extremities. <br><br>We can\u2019t even truely validate many (if not all) our \u2018irrefutable\u2019 and \u2018known\u2019 Laws ffs.

When the quaternion you multiply is on the unit sphere, the sphere gets projected to a plane.<br>   b. When the quaternion you multiply has  a magnitude of 2k with k being a natural number, then you get a sphere.

In the changing graph of the quaternion exploding and reversing around the static circle, to me it appears like we are simply shrinking ourselves at the same rate as the circle as it goes from wrapping around a sphere at the widest area, all the way to the smallest area (or point) on the sphere. This circle would instantaneously pop out the opposite pole of the sphere, as we are now perceiving it&#39;s path of wrapping being smaller than the point unit we are measuring on the sphere. I would be curious to see how this could be better rationalized in our universe by applying motion and spacial friction to this measurement, and seeing how that affects the sphere, now being an active waveform in space.

Time is itself the rate of change between 1,0 and a point in space?\r<br>9. Time could theoretically be turned backwards but you would have to change the rotation of space, practically impossible except at the smallest scale. \r<br>10. But even in this case the future and past would just swap? So on a linear time line the object would still be moving forward into the future that recreates the past as long as it was isolated from other influences?\r<br>11. If Time is nested you have the delicious concept that seems quite reasonable that larger time is just a bigger version of smaller time which means time 1,0 is larger for bigger time and can enclose smaller 1,0 times. This makes sense in that time rolls out in front of you in widening spheres. Of the \r<br>12. Same time.\r<br>13. Since widening spheres of time exist around everything it implies an intertwining of time holding the universe together without dictating that everything is on the same time? The further out or more microscopic another object the less effect the time of the original object has. \r<br>14. Could the Interaction of time act like gravity?\r<br>15. If energy is applied to an object sending an object off in a straight line it\u2019s circle of time while not disappearing a straight line projection with infinity at either end. \r<br>16. (Its still a circle, just a projection so if tending towards -or + infinity just approaching -1,0)\r<br>17. It\u2019s ultimate past and ultimate future are next to each other even though possibly separated by the universe. \r<br>18. If the object is small enough it would be too small like gravity to be affected by other objects if the energy was sufficiently high? \r<br>19. If another object was sufficiently large and close it could pull the object out of its projection bending its time path.\r<br>20. If you fire an object at a wall and it\u2019s stopped by the wall the object will come out of projection and it\u2019s time will collapse from projection to its immediate area.\r<br>21. What if you make TIME a universal 4D object in a moving 3D SPACE?", "comment_date": "2020-02-13T05:20:03Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Olaf98", "comment_text": "Imagine watching the full video, and then realzing, just at the end that it was 30 minutes long because the pi said it", "comment_date": "2020-02-12T13:33:31Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Peshang Ahmed", "comment_text": "... and that is how Felix learned UV unwrapping", "comment_date": "2020-02-11T18:46:52Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Atomic Rust", "comment_text": "felix&#39;s viewpoint is pretty easy as it really is just how our eyes see 3d", "comment_date": "2020-02-10T22:19:47Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Paul P", "comment_text": "Grant, I have benefited so greatly from the unbelievably rich content you have so generously gifted us (the curious of the world) with.

Of course we would need to find out how that system would be able to project figures in that kind of 4D-projected space, because it  must also be able to represent 1D, 2D and 3D figures in a clear way. For example a 1D figure could be the intersection of the 3 spheres in a point, the 2D could be the intersection of the 3 spheres in a circle (or only to of the spheres ?), and a 3D figure would be the movement of the 3 spheres to have the same radius and coordenates of its centers.

I think the way its written has been causing a lot of confusion, because it makes it look like it&#39;s &quot;real math&quot;, when the reality is that it&#39;s just as much &quot;real math&quot; as concatenating strings. Yes there are similarities, but really it&#39;s just doing its own thing, and that&#39;s why the order matters, just like if you &quot;added&quot; strings in another order it wouldn&#39;t come out the same. What I&#39;m seeing right now is that it&#39;s not really a formula, so much as a set of operations. A (and then do) B (and then do) C (and then do) D. It would make more sense to me as 4 lines of code, rather than a bunch of letters and numbers pretending to be ordinary math, when it&#39;s more like an algorithm or multiple function/method calls in a particular order.<br><br>(Disclaimer after writing this up: Just thinking out loud and trying to piece it together here, but this is making more sense than it ever did before, for me.)<br><br>So it&#39;s doing one thing after another, representing a number of relative moves/translations/changes, not simply an absolute position. You could think of the end result after all changes are done as an absolute position, the way you can think of a string after concatenation in terms of its final result, eg:<br><br>&quot;You&quot; + &quot; can &quot; + &quot; do&quot; + &quot; it&quot; = &quot;You can do it&quot;<br><br>But this isn&#39;t ordinary addition, it&#39;s really saying add these letters on to the end of the other string, it&#39;s not &quot;true addition&quot; even though it is really &quot;adding on&quot; in a certain sense. You can think of the overall thing as an &quot;absolute string&quot; (if that makes sense), being the final result after all &quot;additions&quot;/concatenations, but in reality it&#39;s a set of operations/changes that affect it relatively based on where or what it is currently at each step. So changing the order of things changes the recipe so you get different results, just like if you changed the order of string concatenation: &quot; it&quot; + &quot; can &quot; + &quot; do&quot; + &quot;You&quot; = &quot; it can doYou&quot;<br><br>In other words, it&#39;s a series of relative changes to its position, which won&#39;t come out the same if you treat it like an x,y,z absolute position or rotation where you can modify individual parts independently, because in that case each part of the x,y,z is a statement in its own right about how far in that direction something IS, like individual traits, even though you would also be fine treating it as 3 different moves too in that case.<br><br>In other other words, &quot;right 5, then up 2&quot; is the same as &quot;up 2, then right 5&quot;, which is the same as the result and absolute position of &quot;5,2&quot;. Quaternions just don&#39;t work that way.<br><br>The nice thing is that if we only care about rotations, we don&#39;t have to get into this 4th dimension nonsense and it seems to ends up being closer to what I thought rotations always were or were supposed to be in the first place, when I couldn&#39;t understand how gimbal lock would be a problem. I always asked how it could be, until I realized people are moving the axes separate from each other instead of altogether, which might be all you can do for certain things in the physical world, but makes no sense if it&#39;s all digital, and doesn&#39;t necessarily have to be that way for everything in real life. I imagine instead of rings that only rotate the rings inside them, you have a sphere with 3 little motors touching, where each one moves it along one x/y/z axis. That way they don&#39;t get all weird and overlapping, they just rotate the thing a certain amount on a set axis, the way moving on a coordinate plane just moves the thing on the one axis.<br><br>I&#39;m still a bit hazy if that&#39;s exactly what quaternions are doing (without the scalar, in a unit sphere), or if it&#39;s just similar. Or if I&#39;m just getting confused altogether because quaternions are distilled evil.

However, that is not stopping me to throw random (most likely very silly) ideas. Here&#39;s one...<br>Are we all, in fact, Linus the Linelander when it comes to perception of TIME? Is it possible to remake this whole video with the premise that we would consider 3 xyz (or 4 or 8, ahem, octonions...) dimensions and vectors and rotations etc. not in spatial but in temporal sense? Maybe it has already been done, and, if so, I would very much appreciate if anyone could help me find it. One of the challenges would be to properly associate the properties of Y and Z (at least) axis. We perceive time linearly (past-now-future much like behind-here-in front), but... while we also spatially recognize Y down-here-up and Z left-here-right - do we have an idea what would be temporal parallels to this? At least in 3D-Temporal... Would it be slow-normal-fast tempo for one of the temporal axis? Something outside of our capacity to witness and grasp as a concept? Let us also not forget that even when we consider ourselves not moving (like when sleeping) we are actually moving extremely fast, but on a planetary and cosmic level. So much like in time we also constantly move in space. And if we can go forward, sideways and up... Well, shouldn&#39;t there be a relatively comparative &#39;movement&#39; in temporal plain of existence? At least mathematically sound, if yet not possibly physically proven or detected... So... What is up or sideways in temporal dimensions?<br>Has this been discussed anywhere before and where can I find it to learn more? Sorry, if I have offended anyone with my ignorance?

This makes it easy to lift any unary operation on complex numbers to an operation on quaternions, as you can just manipulate the a + b\u00fb representation just as you would a + bi.", "comment_date": "2018-12-21T04:45:00Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Duarte Silva", "comment_text": "How I wish this man would be my Maths professor.", "comment_date": "2018-12-20T16:52:34Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "\u0421\u0435\u0440\u0433\u0435\u0439 \u041d\u0430\u0432\u0440\u043e\u0436\u0438\u043d", "comment_text": "And Quinternion would be a rotation around a direction at certain time? \ud83d\ude01", "comment_date": "2018-12-19T19:33:35Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Ismael Zeidan", "comment_text": "Thank you for all the educational videos.", "comment_date": "2018-12-19T00:56:34Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Maj Smerkol", "comment_text": "How do you the animations?

It is better to see this if one describes quaternions as paravectors in 3-dimensional space.<br><br>Let V be a vector space and F be the scalar field under V. Let P be the direct sum of F and V, such that if p is in P, s is in F, and v is in V, then p = s + v. Now define an inner product on V such that v\u2022v = ||v||^2, and v\u2022w = 0 if w is orthogonal to v. In other words, the inner product is Cartesian. Then the multiplication operator of P is defined by p*q = s.t + s(v) + t(w) + v\u2022w, where p, q are paravectors, s,t are scalar elements, and v,w are vector elements, with * being the paravector multiplication operator, and . denoting the multiplication of scalar elements in F. Define the magnitude operator by ||p||^2 = p\u2019*p with v\u2019 = -v and s\u2019 = s being the conjugation operator, such that p\u2019 = s - v if p = s + v.

The spacetime element, which is usually described as the square of the Lorentz invariant magnitude of the 4-position, is equal to the quaternions square (or paravector square) of the 4-position with itself.

But I question whether it\u2019s all that useful to explain quaternions via spherical projection into lower dimensional, and hence more \u201cintuitive\u201d spaces.  Perhaps it\u2019s a useful visualization if you already know something about quaternions.  But as an \u201cintro to rotation via quaternions\u201d there might be a much more intuitive approach, which I\u2019ll supply below.<br><br>I should mention, as the video alludes to, that this discussion only applies to unit quaternions, the subset of quaternions whose norm is one, the subset of quaternions which correspond to 3-D rotation.  [The norm of a quaternion is the \u201cdistance\u201d of a quaternion to the origin:  sqrt(w\u00b2+x\u00b2+y\u00b2+z\u00b2) given the quaternion w+xi+yj+zk.]<br><br>When you work with quaternions for any period of time in practical graphics applications where they appear (such as the popular Unity gaming/simulation development environment), you quickly discover that it\u2019s best not to peek too much \u201cunder the hood\u201d to examine the actual quaternion coefficient values: w, x, y and z.  There are two alternate representations of unit quaternions, one three dimensional, and the other four dimensional, which are far more intuitive.<br><br>The older approach is to describe an arbitrary rotation in three dimensions via Euler angles, a series of three rotations, usually first around the x-axis, then y-axis, then z-axis, thus resulting in a 3-element tuple,  usually (\u03b1, \u03b2, \u03b3), or (\u03c6, \u03b8, \u03c8) represented in radians or degrees.  Each set of Euler angles translates to an equivalent unit quaternion.  Each unit quaternion can be represented by a particular triplet of Euler angles with the angles specified within some periodic range (usually \u2013\u03c0 to \u03c0 or 0 to 2\u03c0).<br><br>Euler angles have their disadvantages in that the underlying computations are relatively inefficient and can be inaccurate on computer system.  In particular, you have to watch out for gimbal lock when applying successive rotations with the rotation state described via Euler angles.[2]  When you represent the rotation state via quaternions in successive rotations, you don\u2019t encounter either of these problems.<br><br>An alternate way to visualize a unit quaternion is to specify an arbitrary axis of rotation, represented by a unit vector  v\u20d7, and a scalar angle \u03b8 specifying how much rotation occurs around that axis.  The tuple (\u03b8,v\u20d7) is four dimensional: the three real coordinates describing v\u20d7, and the fourth value from the angle \u03b8.  For any unit quaternion w+xi+yj+zk, with sqrt(w\u00b2+x\u00b2+y\u00b2+z\u00b2)=1, there is an equivalent tuple (\u03b8,v\u20d7) and vice-versa.<br><br>To a certain degree, this alternate representation of quaternions is analogous to Cartesian versus polar coordinate systems in 2-D space.  The cartesian and polar representations of conic sections such as circles and ellipses have roughly equal complexity.  But as you represent other curves in space, it\u2019s often the case that a polar representation will be easier to express than a Cartesian one (or vice versa).  By my way of thinking about it, this (\u03b8,v\u20d7) alternative \u201cpolar\u201d representation of quaternions may be simpler to understand, in the sense of being more intuitive than the raw representation of quaternions which is by definition Cartesian in nature (with four mutually orthogonal axes).<br><br>You can intuitively visualize this polar representation of rotation by sticking your right hand in the air with the thumb pointing along the axis of rotation v\u20d7, and the fingers curling to indicate the angle \u03b8.  Four dimensions represented by use of one hand!  [Use your right hand to represent left-side application of rotation using quaternions, use your left hand to represent equivalent right-side application of quaternion rotations.]<br><br>Unlike Euler angles, you don\u2019t end up with gimbal lock problems if you apply several rotations in a chain, though it still ends up being more efficient (though less intuitive) to work purely within the realm of quaternions on computer systems.  The Unity package displays quaternions via nine values, actually:  three translation values along the x,y and z axes, three scaling values along the same axes, and the three Euler angles around the same three axes.  But this doesn\u2019t suggest a nine-dimensional space, per se, since a (non-unit) quaternion can describe all three operations simultaneously using just four real coefficients.<br><br>The video below describes the alternate (\u03b8,v\u20d7) representation quite nicely, though it delves into the specifics of OpenGL and a \u201cQT\u201d software packages in a course relating to computer graphics using these specific software tools.[1]  Interestingly, although the presenter makes numerous mathematic and factual errors in the presentation, such as referring to the originator of quaternions as Heisenberg, not Hamilton, the concepts presented are quite spot on.  The presenter shows the tuples in a slightly different form, {cos \u03b8, (sin \u03b8) v\u20d7}, but this is a representational detail not worth going into.  It\u2019s fairly straightforward to derive (or find online) the formulas to convert between unit quaternions and Euler angles, or unit quaternions and the (\u03b8,v\u20d7) or {cos \u03b8, (sin \u03b8) v\u20d7} representations.<br><br>[NOTE:  This comment was first posted to my Science vs. Universe group on Facebook.]<br><br><i>______________________________________</i><br>SOURCES<br><br>[1]  &lt;<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHVwd8gYLnI&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=1457%3E\">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHVwd8gYLnI&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=1457&gt;</a><br><br>[2]  &lt;<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N5PDboNJwks%3E\">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N5PDboNJwks&gt;</a>", "comment_date": "2018-10-16T05:16:03Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Relationship Chat TV", "comment_text": "Try doing split complex numbers for us", "comment_date": "2018-10-16T01:55:42Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Lionel Mart\u00ednez", "comment_text": "Subtitles!!!

I somehow prefer 3-4 hours explanion in videos found when you put &quot;njwildberger quaternion&quot; into search box. First deals with complex numbers and concept of reflections (interesting idea to thing about rotation as pair of reflections), 2nd deals with adding rotations, 3rd with quaternions and 4th optional with using them. It&#39;s mostly boring algebra, but it helps to grasp basics and I guess last 10 minutes of first part dealing with mapping rotations into line 1+i*t and parametrization of circle helps a lot. It took me watching each two minutes five times however, but it&#39;s basically about projections. Actually backwards ... how to find any point of circle from the line. <br>Another good stuff is practical use and mapping rotations around vector into quaternions (surprisingly this is enough to describe any spatial orientation in two possible ways). I&#39;m quite interested in seeing why rotation is done by q*v*conjugate(q) - is it reflection into 4d space and reflection back into 3d?. Another interesting concept is using quaternions for finding misorientation angle and for generating random rotations by using sphere of diameter pi, generating random points inside and taking length of the vector a rotation angle and normalizing it into rotation axis.", "comment_date": "2018-10-05T18:24:11Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Cesar Uriel Ray\u00f3n S\u00e1nchez", "comment_text": "[Secci\u00f3n de comentarios en Espa\u00f1ol]\ud83c\udf0e\ud83d\udea9\u00bfSoy el \u00fanico que habla espa\u00f1ol y que le encatan estos videos?", "comment_date": "2018-10-05T05:22:08Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Alex Leach", "comment_text": "Can you please make a video about Tensors?", "comment_date": "2018-10-05T04:33:19Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Alexis Amico", "comment_text": "linus should have been named Richard cause he uh,, *coughcough*,,..,,.,,, nvm", "comment_date": "2018-10-05T00:29:46Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "NModds", "comment_text": "Thank you for this.", "comment_date": "2018-10-04T23:41:38Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "deepak B", "comment_text": "I really respect this channel has really brought mathematical concept very well .Simply good.

The double angle or half angle controversy was blown out of all proportions for political reasons , but the development of the dot product and the cross product relied heavily on this aspect of the quaternions product elucidated by Grassmann and Clifford. .

I have a question about 3d perception. Could someone verify the follow  statements?

Also movement through the game helps us see in depth. Now in reality we perceive 3d because both eyes have a slightly different image, a mechanism called parallax. If I have never seen an object and stay perfectly immobile I can map it in 3d. Right? Here is where I want to get to: we have left/right differential but not up/down. This means we can see the difference in distance between two objects floating side by side in space (ie with no other reference) but not on on top of the other! Geddit? Our 3d perception is not perfect... Wow! OK now for visualising 4d we need maybe colors, time, sound?? Basically a lot of your visualisations involve a kind of film morphing the object.

It requires the abstract concept of higher dimensional geometry to understand how you&#39;re getting that projection, which is no more intuitive than the original problem.

The concept of redefining multiplications as &quot;x acting on y&quot; is very helpful. One thing you didn&#39;t mention though, one of the main reasons quaternions are so useful, is  that they can be easily interpolated with the SLERP formula. If you have a starting orientation represented by quaternion A, and a final orientation given by quaternion B, this formula can generate a quaternion for every infinitessimal step in between, giving a smooth path from one to the other.

With direction in mind, its easier to picture a sphere with north pole pointing on the positive side of the z axis (i use webgl, so z is forward for me). From there its easy for me then to think of an axis and angle of rotation to apply to the forward direction to create a new forward direction that when applied to a mesh, does exactly that, change its forward direction... but again... this is how I&#39;ve come to imagine it to help me use it when doing graphics programming, I may be wrong.<br><br>I did like the 1D visuals on how to imagine sliding and scaling.

I <b>own</b> <a href=\"http://quaternions.com/\">quaternions.com</a>, so I guess that makes me a descent of the Quaternion Society. Your visualization is a great accomplishment for analytic geometry. The problem with it is the same one that has plagued complex numbers: why is the reflection of real numbers different from the reflection of imaginary numbers? Quaternions add the kicker that there are three more imaginary flips and no more for the reals, so unfair. Search for &quot;quaternion baseball&quot; on YouTube for my explanation. But it is simple: Real-&gt;Time, Imaginary-&gt;3D Space. The world of analytic <b>animations</b> has to be born. Everything necessarily has to be a short film, no paper paper or book will suffice. Real reflection requires memory: that was in the past is now in the future. Imaginary reflection uses mirrors: it is now her and over there. There is one past, one future. There are three mirrors for space. Hamilton gravitated to &quot;pure quaternions&quot; or vectors instead of inventing space-time 60 years before Einstein, what a missed opportunity! Hamilton got freaked out by the square of a quaternion. I bought the domain because the square has the Lorentz invariant interval of special relativity and that is no accident. It took me 17 years to put the dtdR to good use, but that is another story. And just a warning: in quantum mechanics, folks always toss in an extra factor of i which makes the result not be a division algebra, a form of cheating.
