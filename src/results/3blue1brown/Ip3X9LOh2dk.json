The area of a parallelogram between two vectors can be calculated as the magnitude of the cross product between those two vectors. But since the cross product is only defined in 3 dimensions, we can think of two-dimensional space as a plane that sits at 0 on the z-axis. That way, we can extrapolate i-hat and j-hat (and thus any other vector in two-dimensional space) into three dimensions by simply putting 0 in the last line. We can now calculate the determinant of a matrix [ a b (new line) c d ] as the magnitude of the cross product of the transformed versions of i-hat [a c 0] and j-hat [b d 0], which ultimately turns out to be the square root of (a*d - c*b)\u00b2, since both the x-axis and the y-axis of the resulting cross product yield a value of 0 (which kinda makes sense if you think about it, since the cross product of two vectors is defined as another vector being at right angles to both, so if we enter two vectors that both do not move along the z-axis, the resulting vector will move only along the z-axis).", "comment_date": "2021-12-18T14:43:32Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Anuar Maa", "comment_text": "Im gonna code my own minecraft", "comment_date": "2021-12-18T03:18:43Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Brenno Moura", "comment_text": "Comparing this to the tradictional way i was tought, i am really starting to think my former teachers not even knew all that stuff", "comment_date": "2021-12-16T17:36:14Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Owen Talabi", "comment_text": "I Love this channel. im 2 hours away from my linear algebra exam and i feel like my brain has opened up just from watching a few of these videos", "comment_date": "2021-12-14T10:56:12Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Max Gao", "comment_text": "what is the program you are using, would it be possible to link it? thank you", "comment_date": "2021-12-14T10:12:57Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "TheGreatLumos", "comment_text": "no fucking way thats what a determinant is", "comment_date": "2021-12-13T07:10:34Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Afshan Ali", "comment_text": "This man right here is a sorcerer!", "comment_date": "2021-12-13T05:31:27Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "cjcfs140", "comment_text": "When I first watch the video it seems that I as the viewer am fixed in space and space is scaling/flipping.

If the x and y values of this rectangle (ad) are displaced by a larger amount than the y and x values of the rectangle described by the opposing transformation of i hat (y value AKA c) and of j hat (x value AKA b), then I hat will point mostly x and j hat points mostly y.

But since a determinant of 0 for a 3D matrix can result from not only squishing space onto a point or line, but also sheet. And for a sheet, 2 columns would actually have to be linearly independent. After all, how are we producing the 2 dimensions of a sheet without the existence of 2 linearly independent  vectors.  But then of course the third column would have to be linearly dependent.  So I am just saying that while it is possible for all three columns to be linearly dependent , it is ALSO possible that 2 of these columns are actually linearly independent and the third, linearly dependent.

But I think you should mix abstract knowledge with history. <br>I mean at some point someone asked a specific question about something and determinant was the answer. Every single thing in math when initially invented was an answer to some question, then abstracted, generalized and put into textbook with the context omitted. When you start to dig in math history and find those initial motivations for things everything become so clear and understandable. No one just invents abstractions out of the blue. People solve problems, then abstract solutions, then look for more applications for a newfound problem-solution system. And people shouldn&#39;t learn abstractions without context, yet university textbooks are like this and it&#39;s the reason they are so hard to get trough. <br>Honestly, math taught to engineers (basic calculus, algebra and so on) isn&#39;t terrible complicated when you move from one concept to another. Books just written in a hard to grasp way and you spend too much time wrapping your head around simple thing presented in a complicated manner. I have relatively good textbooks that explain some of the required intuition, but not all of it. It was better with calculus, when they spent 3 pages of graphs to explain how logic of the limits work before presenting formal definition. Linear algebra books lack in this regard.

It is able to do this because it introduces eigenvalues before introducing determinants. As for why most other texts don\u2019t do this, it is, in some ways, pedagogically reasonable to introduce determinants before eigenvalues, because they are relevant to many powerful results that you are otherwise fully equipped to work with relatively early in your linear algebra education, but once eigenvalues are introduced they really should all redefine the determinant in this way. The fact that they don\u2019t is why most professors don\u2019t teach this. Unfortunately in my experience (top 10 math university), most undergrad professors just regurgitate the exposition, definitions, and proofs in the assigned text without offering a shred of their own understanding or observations, and this is particularly true in linear algebra.

A vector space is defined over a field, and R is a really good example of field. But R is also a complete metric space, a set with an important optional: a distance defined between any of its elements. So, a vector space of a certain dimension over R (possible, since R is a field) is a metric vector space (since R is a metric space we can define a norm), in particular an Euclidean vector space. In this scenario, it is natural to talk about volumes, areas and lenghts, since we can always literally &quot;measure&quot; things. But think a moment about more abstract vector spaces, such as spaces of functions: can you, with the same simplicity, define a norm, in this case? Another example is the determinant of a permutation matrix: it can only be 1 or -1 and represents the parity of the permutation associated with that matrix. But makes any sense to talk about the &quot;volume of a permutation&quot;? So i think that, usually, this beautiful and elegant interpretation of the determinant is sacrificed, for the sake of strictness and generality. Pretty sad though.

Between these set of videos and my current class, I can say I\u2019m truly grasping the reason why mathematics it\u2019s not only truthful, but also beautiful.<br><br>P.S. for the determinant of two matrixes multiplied, you can first analyze the determinants of elementary matrixes (notated as E) multiplied by a matrix C, which corresponds to det(EC)=det(E)\u2022det(C). <br><br>Then, for det(AB), assume that both A and B are invertible, which implies that the columns are linearly independent and the determinant is non-zero. Because of this, matrix A can be defined as a set of elementary matrices (Ek...E1) that are equivalent to A when multiplied with one another. This goes to the first statement that det(EC)=det(E)\u2022det(C). Do that for each elementary matrix that represent A, then det(AB) = det[(Ek\u2022...\u2022E1)\u2022B]= det(Ek)\u2022...det(E1)\u2022det(B). Combine the elementary matrices again, which says that det(Ek\u2022...\u2022E1)\u2022det(B) = det(A)\u2022det(B). <br><br>Now, when at least one matrix is not invertible, then it is linearly dependent. Assuming without any loss of generality that A is non-invertible, then det(A) = 0 and AB will be a linearly dependent matrix, and thus, non-invertible as well. Since AB is linearly dependent, then the det(AB) = 0 = 0\u2022det(B) = det(A)\u2022det(B).<br><br>Therefore, det(AB)=det(A)\u2022det(B)<br><br>For this, I assumed that it is known that det(EC)=det(E)\u2022det(C) where E is an elementary matrix, and I also assumed the first theorem that det(A) is \u2260 0 iff A is invertible.", "comment_date": "2020-02-18T02:56:58Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "babak taghavi", "comment_text": "Awesome explanation!

The intuition I got from my statistics class was that the mean is the &quot;center of mass&quot; of a set of data, and that the variance is roughly a measure of how concentrated data is near that center of mass. But as for how it relates to higher-order moments, or how it relates to the skewness of a set of data, I&#39;m completely clueless.

I recently learned about the Wronskian determinant in Differential Equations, and while it&#39;s not a particularly hard thing to _do_, I didn&#39;t really understand what the Wronskian being zero had to do with solutions of an ODE being linearly dependent (bearing in mind that I haven&#39;t taken Linear Algebra; all I knew about the determinant was 1. how to compute it and 2. that it&#39;s useful for cross products). Then <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip3X9LOh2dk&amp;t=3m12s\">3:12</a> happened and it clicked! Solutions to a differential equation are just a vector space, and for a 2nd order equation, it&#39;s a two-dimensional solution space. If two solutions are linearly independent, their span is the entire plane, and thus all solutions (which are vectors) are a linear combination of those two solutions (which are the basis vectors). The determinant - the Wronskian - is useful here because it allows us to check if these solutions are linearly dependent or not. If the Wronskian determinant is zero, it means that the solution space is being squashed onto a line, and you&#39;re losing solutions.<br><br>I&#39;m still not 100% sure why the Wronskian matrix is what it is, but this was a great insight.

There is another meaning of the 2x2 determinant formula, related to the cross product: Think of one column vector as a wind force blowing onto a paddle given by the other column vector.

Decompose both vectors along x and y, then only components at right angles generate torque: so the total torque is<br><br>(x component of L(i)) * (y component of L(j)) - (x component of L(j)) * (y component of L(i)) = ad - bc<br><br>The minus sign stems from the opposite orientation of that second contribution.<br><br>2. The cofactor expansion for calculating the determinant, as arcane as it may appear, also has geometric interpretation: It amounts to shearing the parallelepiped along the components of one of its spanning vectors, making use of the shear invariance of volume (which is simply Cavalieri&#39;s Principle). The paralleleliped is thus sheared and decomposed into right prisms, each of whose volume is just base * height.
