(I guess it&#39;s because A: I was looking for the minimal solution in both cases, which is clearly less steps in the unlimited version, though I didn&#39;t prove that I found it in either case, and B: because I had already solved the previous version my own way, and seen your explanation when I watched the previous video.) Also, the connection to ternary counting seemed much more obvious this time than the connection to binary counting in the last video (which I still don&#39;t entirely understand) did. The only issue is that the solution to the constrained version takes so long that I forgot which way I was trying to go halfway through. (Specifically, I thought I knew which way I was going, but then I became unsure when I had to move the bottom book backwards as an intermediate step. Now I think about it though, I really shouldn&#39;t have had to do that, so my solution probably wasn&#39;t actually minimal. I probably made it take much longer by doing that.) Unlike my solution to the unconstrained version, though, no real thought was required while performing the solution to the constrained version, so all I really had to do was wait and see where it ended up.

To get s1, go through your rules and replace every instance of a symbol with whatever&#39;s on the right-hand side of its rule. So in the example above, s0 is the string A, and s1 is the string B-A-B. Then we get s2 by doing the same thing with s1.<br><br>s2, then, is A+B+A-B-A-B+A+B+A, and so forth. This gets out of hand pretty quickly doing it manually, but with a computer it&#39;s easy to expand this string as far as you want or have room in memory. Then what you&#39;re left with is basically a <b>set of instructions</b> to one of those LOGO turtles you may have encountered if you&#39;ve ever taken an intro CS class.

And more extensively, is there a way to link that fractal dimension and counting in ternary. Because in my view after watching this video is that this could be used to a really awesome application, either in computing or in networking, etc. imagine using a fractal as a sort of map reference: where you could index data, based on location or visa versa. As mentioned, the configurations would all be used to create the final Hanoi tower, and so all information is needed; but by using this method, one could index the data points (the configurations) in a manner that relates to each other data point most significant to it.
