It involves tetration of negative numbers and I broke my tiny brain trying it with -2 just 4 times let alone square root -sqrt2 infinite times. But while doing that for -2, I got &#39;i&#39; somewhere. And then I thought, what if instead of doing all this, on the original function we used log? So i tried doing log function on teration of 2 where 2 repeats 4 times. And a bunch of things happened. I got confused as to how the log function here would even work. can we even take log of positive tetrations? Because tetration is supposed to work top down when solving power and log kind of works down to up. I tried it anyway and after just two tried, I realized,  you cant take log of negatives unless it is complex numbers. And then I realized, we used ln for the graph. So maybe we ahould have worked the whole thing using log(z) to begin with.  I don&#39;t know, my head hurts, so I am gonna stop.

What you are actually considering is convergence properties as it relates to fixed points. Fixed points are points on a function where the input maps to same output. Fixed points are a really cool piece of math that are incredibly important to an incredibly large number of areas in math. They are not something that is normally covered at the k12 level or even in early calculus classes though they definitely should be particularly in calc 2. These become highly important in advanced math. Arguably one of the most beautiful proofs in mathematics was the first proof of the Brouwer Fixed Point Theorem, which, among showing this for any convex and compact subset of a Banach space (all Euclidean spaces are notably part of this set) , showed that any continuous mapping of the closed unit disk to itself has at least 1 fixed point.", "comment_date": "2020-11-29T17:03:18Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "CellarDoor1729", "comment_text": "@<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=elQVZLLiod4&amp;t=19m21s\">19:21</a> to be explicitly clear about the error in logic here. Something happened that doesn\u2019t normally happen when we\u2019re dealing with normal equations. You don\u2019t normally plug an equation into itself in order to solve it. Most of the time, this will just result in something like 0 = 0,  but, in this case, we did do that. The mistake is really subtle, but, by plugging an equation into itself you have just assumed that the equation has a solution. If it were to have no solution then we can simply think of the equation itself being invalid since there is no value for which it is true, so plugging it into itself in cases where there is no solution will result in a concrete answer since you just assumed that the equation had to have one, but since the logic is circular it does not prove that that answer is actually correct. Notice how we also ignored the negative solution that spits out of our logic. This solution quite obviously doesn\u2019t solve our equation considering that we are taking decimal powers of a negative number, but it comes out anyway since we assumed the equation converges. What you have, however, is something really useful which is the conditional statement that if the equation does converge for the value that our logic spits out then the resulting answer is a solution.", "comment_date": "2020-11-29T16:39:21Z", "likes_count": 8}, {"comment_by": "\ua9c1 Abraham \ua9c2", "comment_text": "I am gonna guess you keep on nearing square roots of 4 which will approach one.", "comment_date": "2020-11-25T23:42:37Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Van Eyck", "comment_text": "ok MATH.", "comment_date": "2020-11-25T14:50:34Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Marc Nu\u00f1ez", "comment_text": "Real nice!

Then, I would create the function f1(x) = f0(f0(x)), and the list F2 = join(F1,f1(F1)), and then create the function f2(x) = f1(f1(x)), and the list F3 = join(F2,f2(F2)), and so on.

This reminded me of my approach to find real solutions to powers.<br>For instance by my calculations I can find this example for a real solution with a base of (-\u221a2) and an exponent that is not real:<br>(-\u221a2)^(1/5-3/10\u03c0+3/ln\u20612\u00b7i) = -2^((2\u03c0-3)/20\u03c0-15\u03c0/(ln\u20612)^2)<br><br>But start at the beginning:<br>Let&#39;s say we have the complex numbers w and z. If we consider all the possible solutions for w^z in the complex plain, under what conditions will the solution be real?<br>Here are variables:   w,z\u2208C,   r,\u03c6,a,b\u2208R,   n,k\u2208Z<br>And define w and z like this:   w=r\u00b7e^(i\u00b7(\u03c6+2n\u03c0))\r,   z=a+b\u00b7i<br><br>By calculating w^z I find two options for real solution: The fist one is trivial: If w=0 then w^z is 0, which is real, for all complex numbers z. (But consider for z=0: 0^0 is an indeterminate form.)<br>The second option is this condition:   b\u00b7ln\u2061r+a\u00b7(\u03c6+2n\u03c0)=k\u03c0<br>So if we find a combination for integers n and k with the given values of r,\u03c6,a,b to satisfy this condition, the result will be a real number.<br><br>Here is a proof for conditions we knew already, but can be confirmed now:<br>Let&#39;s see what we will have if z is a real number. The condition goes down to this:   z\u00b7(\u03c6+2n\u03c0)=k\u03c0<br>If additionally w is a positive real number, we get   2zn=k.   That means we can choose n=0 regardless of the value of z, and get k=0. So if the base is positive and the exponent is real, we will always have at least one real solution. (For example: In this consideration of all possible solutions, 4^(1/2) has two: +2 and -2)<br>If on the other hand w is a negative real number, we can solve for z:   z=k/(2n+1).   That means: If the base is negative, the result can only be real if the exponent is a rational number with an odd denominator. (For example (-8)^(2/3)=4)<br>This also means: A negative real number raised to the power of an irrational real number has definitely no real solutions whatsoever.<br><br>Now I want to find a complex number z, for which (-\u221a2)^z is real. The condition ends up like this:   b\u00b7ln\u20612=2\u03c0(k-a\u00b7(2n+1)).

And as we know with roots of unity (I think you called it something different in the lecture about it but that what I learned in A level further maths) that has 4 evenly spaced solutions which lay on a circle in the complex plane. However the circle is no longer a unit circle because we aren\u2019t evaluating when x**4=1. To prove this is a lot of work but for z**n=a where n is an integer, the solutions lie on a circle of radius   |a| *</b> 1/n. In our case a is 4 so modulus of a positive real number is itself, so the radius of our circle is 4**1/4 which we saw earlier is square root 2. Roots of unity also shows us that if a is real the first root will lie on the real axis. So our first root is square root 2. By the nice symmetry of 4 and knowing that the roots are evenly spaced on this circle we know the other roots are square root 2*i, -square root 2 and -square root 2*i. I\u2019m not sure how these complex numbers fair with the fractal pattern as to whether they converge or not, but we can rule out -square root 2 because it\u2019s out of range, and square root 2 we already saw converges to 2 instead. Although on the topic of that, something cool I noticed is that while it only converges to 2, because at 4 the slope is too steep, the lines y=b**x and y=x do intersect at 2 AND 4, which I believe is why 4 may seem like an acceptable solution in principle because it satisfies b**x=x, however it doesn\u2019t satisfy the prior condition of the power tower.", "comment_date": "2020-05-12T22:32:19Z", "likes_count": 3}, {"comment_by": "siquod", "comment_text": "My record on the puzzle so far is 2^(2^^(2^^16384)+1) coins.

In his popular math book published 1995, Rudy Rucker used the notation \u207fx = x^(x^(x^(...x^x))...) with n copies of x. He seems to be the person to first popularize the name &quot;tetration&quot; for this operation, first introduced by Goodstein in 1947, and he would read this notation &quot;the nth tetration of x&quot; (by analogy to &quot;the nth power of x&quot; for x\u207f). He also gives further notations, like \u2099x for the nth pentation of x (defined recursively as above), x\u2099 for the nth hexation of x, and then using overlines for further iterations, like x\u207f\u0305 for heptation, \u0305\u207fx for octation, etc. Past decation, Unicode is no longer capable of typesetting this, but TeX has no trouble.<br><br>Knuth notation is also shown, and that notation is far more practical. You have xn for x\u00b7n, x\u2191n for x\u207f, x\u2191\u2191n for \u207fx, etc. The biggest advantage of Knuth&#39;s notation (apart from being easier to type and read) is that it can be indexed. For instance, x\u2191\u00b9\u00b2n means x\u2191\u2191\u2191\u2191\u2191\u2191\u2191\u2191\u2191\u2191\u2191\u2191n.
