Consequently, this means that there will be no temperature change in time for any point along the length of the rod (this is a consequence of the heat equation). However, this contradicts my intuition, which tells me that heat will always flow from hotter to colder spots and, eventually, the hotter places will decrease in temperature, while the colder ones - increase.

Should it draw at a fixed velocity, always drawing the same proportion of the line with each time step? Should it accelerate and then decelerate, like the one you use? Maybe it should start moving quickly, but end slowly? I have no idea! I don\u2019t think anyone could just pop into whatever animation software, draw a nice velocity curve, and say \u201cyes, this is what I want because I have solved the problem of animating lines.\u201d Humans can\u2019t pull that arbitrarily out of a hat, and math doesn\u2019t have those answers.<br><br>But then I realized, if you look at an example animation - well, everything changes. That animation is way too slow; I think it would look better faster. Going at a constant rate is boring, add some energy with dynamic speeds.<br>Humans cannot just generate numbers like that and expect them to work. But what they <b>can</b> do is look at a preexisting condition and say if it\u2019s too high or too low, if it\u2019s too fast or too slow - indeed, we are differential equations generators ourselves!<br><br>Thanks for helping me see math in yet another area of our lives", "comment_date": "2020-06-23T02:09:12Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Mgcini Wata", "comment_text": "I needed this in varsity.

Otherwise they&#39;re the same -- by definition of things not physically moving. <br><br>Once things DO move, however.. they are not. You need to know what the material derivative is, or at least the distinction between the total derivative dt (changes due to any change with time, including changes caused by having a velocity for a moving thing) and the partial derivative \u2202t (changes due just to that variable alone).<br><br>This comes up in fluid dynamics, but it is most irritating in electrodynamics, where the dt terms in Faradays&#39; Law of induction and the implicit velocity of net charge in Ampere&#39;s circuital law are neglected in the most commonly taught form of &#39;Maxwell&#39;s Equations&#39;  (which are actually Oliver Heaviside&#39;s nondimensional rewrite of Maxwell&#39;s actual Equations). Consequently they need to have the Lorentz force law tacked on before also applying ye olde Newton&#39;s equations. Numerically you have to use a really ugly &#39;back and forth&#39; method if substantial charge is moving, ie, enough that the thing(s) whose motion you are trying to solve itself/themselves cause a change to the spatial charge density rho, or the spatial current density vector J, <b>as</b> they move. <br><br>Maxwell was interested only if there was a solution which would enable electrical energy transfer between disconnected wires over an intervening space, without any physical velocities allowed. <br>In this case only is it reasonable to simply assert that only partial \u2202/\u2202t terms are needed, and are equivalent to the total derivative. This works out well when you also discover/consider typical electron drift velocities in wires --- practically motionless! mm/hr etc.<br><br>So it&#39;s good for antenna design (you can solve for a time-dependant current in different [but fixed in space] wires, without going &#39;back and forth&#39; with Newtons -- you can link it to a circuit equation using circuit inductance to eliminate worrying about inertia), and hopelessly useless for electric motor / solenoid design. (Unless you  &#39;cheat&#39; numerically, by swapping back and forth between M-E and Newton&#39;s laws of motion on every timestep -- but even there, it&#39;s only really good for equipment design where significant vibrations of similar frequencies to the EM waves don&#39;t occur, or where there is moving charge, but it&#39;s an insignificant proportion of the total unbalanced space charge, as in high energy particle accelerators and vacuum tubes of not-too-high beam currents). <br><br><br><br>Interesting further reading: Hertzian Electrodynamics also Weber&#39;s Electrodynamics, which also collapses the electrico/magneto-static fields down to a single unified force field (parameterized in phase space, as the force depends on the velocity of the charge which experience it, at every position coordinate).<br><br>Especially also Thomas E. Phipps Jr&#39;s books -- where he points out in great detail that Einstein was totally wrong to try to apply relative motion to Maxwell&#39;s Equations, and the contradictions and paradoxes that result should come as no surprise. <br><br>He also points out that time dilation is certainly a thing, but that there&#39;s no reason all observers couldn&#39;t agree to use the one clock -- modulo some relativistic correction factor, and this is indeed the case (or GPS would probably not work). He also shows that with any optical continuous wave interferometry system you should not expect to observe any &#39;frame dragging&#39;, but that with a ring configuration, excited with brief counter-propagating pulses, you sure can build a laser-gyroscope without moving parts -- very sensitive to rotation about an axis perpendicular to the plane in which the ring area is. <br><br><br>Pick any engineering text book on electric motor mechanical design, and you&#39;ll probably find the relevant math hasn&#39;t actually changed at all in the last century -- it&#39;s still Faraday&#39;s / Ampere&#39;s, and not M-E.<br><br>Yet Phipps couldn&#39;t get papers published on this -- was too &quot;Heretical&quot;. Hence the books &quot;Heretical Verities&quot; and &quot;Old physics for new&quot;. <br><br>I&#39;m not sure about all his conclusions, in particular I feel that electrodynamics needs to break down into a Quantum-compatible &#39;covering&#39; model, but I could see how that might work.", "comment_date": "2020-02-16T13:05:47Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Akshay Sachan", "comment_text": "At <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ly4S0oi3Yz8&amp;t=7m13s\">7:13</a> i just paused the video for 5 minutes and just stood there admiring the beauty of the heat equation and Grant Sanderson.", "comment_date": "2020-02-16T12:38:21Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Kevin Brower", "comment_text": "This is my first 3Blue1Brown video.

It seems to me that the laplacian of a multivariable function is the sum of its partial derivatives.

From a physical viewpoint it&#39;s obvious that these are different things but from a purely mathematical viewpoint what makes the time dimension special for this equation?

Which means that the change in the temperature (T) will be the minus of T times another constant (alpha*w^2). For such an ODE, the solution is an exponential decay(C*exp(-alpha*w^2*t)), so you can guess that the solution to the heat equation in this case will be Asin(wx)*exp(-alpha*w^2*t), and you can try and see that it satisfies the heat equation. And if the initial state is the sum of two different sine waves, the solution will be the sum of the solutions of each individual sine wave (because of the linearity of the PDE). So if I represent a function as a series of sine wave, you get a solution (which can still be an infinite sum of sine waves, multiplied by exponentials, so I don&#39;t know how it really helps, but still, this is the how far I got, without actually knowing too much about PDEs specifically, and DEs in general), so if you have anything else, I will be glad to hear it, because I don&#39;t have the patience to wait for another week, I will probably lose my sanity before then.", "comment_date": "2019-04-21T18:24:26Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Dragrath1", "comment_text": "I have always found it quite fascinating how everything in physics in one form or another can be traced back to partial differential equations or their higher dimensional analogs, mathematics describes everything around us so neatly  that it is effectively a language of the universe, which makes it all the more despairing how little most people seem to know.

As for the derivation - The derivation using <a href=\"http://1.st/\">1.st</a> law of thermodynamics, the definition of the Fourier heat flux and the divergence theorem is rather straightforward: the time rate of change of the internal energy accumulated in a infinitesimal volume of the substance, is equal to the net efflux of heat through the surface of this volume element. The later can then be turned into its divergence with the integral on both sides being over the infinitesimal volume,  then both sides integrals can drop as the infinitesimal volume is arbitrary, and you are left with the differential equation.)", "comment_date": "2019-04-21T17:43:35Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "KitagumaIgen", "comment_text": "Baby-faced, poodle-haired?

For example, some of you ask if a function with constant non-zero slope is stable.  Indeed, this is something that needs to be specified for a well-defined solution, so good question!  The heat equation as described here only describes the interior.  The easiest boundary condition to work with is when each endpoint is held fixed, e.g. if the ends of the rod were somehow constrained not to change temperature.  In that case, straight lines are a stable solution.
