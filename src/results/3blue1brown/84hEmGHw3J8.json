Each point that it adds, it adds a line to each point. Each line, adds: one new section plus the number of points on one side of the line times the number of points on the other side of the line. The number of points each line adds, can be written in as a formula given number of points on either side (or total points, and which point it goes to), and the sum of all the lines for each point added can be a sigma of all the lines that point adds. The number of sections for any number of points on a circle, is just the sum of those sigmas added together (a sigma of sigmas).<br>I wrote a formula for it using Mathematica: 1+Sum[Sum[n*(C-2-n)+1,{n,0,C-2}],{C,2,T}]<br>1 because a circle with no points has 1 section, T for the total number of points, C for the current number of points being calculated, and n for the number of points on one of the sides.<br>(Try it by plugging in values for T at: <a href=\"https://sandbox.open.wolframcloud.com/\">https://sandbox.open.wolframcloud.com/</a> )<br>Works quite nicely, and works for all of the values in this video.

I was wondering why I recognized this sequence, and then it clicked. A few months ago I worked on a similar problem (maybe the same one just in different context), I thought of it this way: \u00a0<br><br>Consider cutting n-dimensional space with (n-1)-dimensional slices and then observing the number of segments/sections/pieces that result when this process is maximized to produce the most pieces. For example: cutting lines with points, planes with lines, 3d-space with planes, and so forth. The premise of this video, curiously enough, seems to relate the 4d (yes 4 dimensional) instance of this problem. I may not be able to answer all your questions but here are some insights...<br><br>Let Pn(x), be the maximum number of pieces produced when cutting n-dimensional space with x (n-1)<del>dimensional slices. The way I went about this problem was to first consider the trivial, 1d case</del> cutting the line with points. This yields the sequence P1(x) =(1,2,3,4,...) (P1(0) = 1, P1(1) = 2,...). Now we consider the 2d case, also pretty easy to figure out- to maximize number of pieces, all we need do is make our new lines intersect all of our previous lines. Just by counting the segments created, we see that the number of pieces created when cutting the plane with lines follows this sequence: P2(x) = (1,2,4,7,11,16,22,...). It may not be immediately obvious, but interestingly, the number of pieces produced for the 2d case, is recursively defined in terms of the number of pieces produced for the 1d case. That is to say, P2(x) = P2(x-1) + P1(x-1) given\u00a0P2(0) = 1. Although it gets tough to visualize, the same can be done in three dimensions- when adding in planes, we still just need to make sure that each subsequent plane intersects all those preceding it. We end up with the sequence, P3(x) = (1,2,4,8,15, 26, 42,...). We can also observe that P3(x) = P3(x-1) + P2(x-1), given P3(0) = 1. As you might suspect, in general, Pn(0) = 1, Pn(x) = Pn(x-1) + P(n-1)(x-1). And if you don&#39;t like the recursive definition: Pn(x) = Sum(from k=0, to n) xCk. It&#39;s a slice of Pascal&#39;s Triangle (you can figure that one out).\u00a0<br><br>So here are the sequences:<br>P1(x) =(1,2,3,4,5,6,7...)<br>P2(x) = (1,2,4,7,11,16,22,...)<br>P3(x) = (1,2,4,8,15, 26, 42,...)<br>And here&#39;s the winner...\u00a0<br>P4(x) = (1,2,4,8,16,31,57,...)<br>As you can see, they all flirt with the powers of two for a little while.\u00a0<br><br>It&#39;s fascinating to me that premise of this video relates to cutting 4-space, with 3-space.
