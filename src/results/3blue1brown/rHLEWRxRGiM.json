I love maths! But I find it so difficult to ground. The difference between convention and fact was never taught to me, and so the grammar of mathematics overwhelmed me.

As a scientist, thinking about change geometrically allowed me to see graphical representation in wholly new ways. <br><br>This way of thinking helped me through my undergrad and masters, and will surely help me during my upcoming PhD, and Im currently reading mathematics books to push my learning further.

I think the visualisation of which transformation is first algebraically by representing the multiplication of matrices as A*B should be A matrix is applied first and then B is applied second. I know it sounds crazy, but it works out right.<br><br>The thing is that if we were to transform the standard [ 1 , 0 , 0 ; 0 , 1 , 0 ; 0 , 0 , 1 ] matrix re-defining it&#39;s basis vectors we would take the Matrix B as the function (a matrix containing 3 vertical vectors - according to Computer Scientist Convention), and use each values of those vectors x,y,z to scale the basis vectors of the system A (standard system).<br><br>Taking that analogy to matrix multiplication, we would have already transformed standard matrix from the previous example (Matrix B), and we would like to re-define it again, by redefining the basis vectors, but this time the vectors of Matrix B. We would then take 3 vectors put together in a matrix C, to use the Bassi vectors of matrix B to create a composition final matrix. <br><br>So if we look at the order, the way the transformations were applied, would be first to the standard matrix A we would apply B and then C, which should be written:<br><br>A * B * C, and not the other way around, as we are basing the new system on the basis vectors of the previous one. While in the video you showed that operation for the inside is applied first, which would make the whole scaling of the basis vectors of the matrix on the left invalid, as the matrix on the left should be the one that we are applying the transformation to.<br><br>I was figuring it out watching the videos meticulously from the beginning of the series, and understanding each component.
