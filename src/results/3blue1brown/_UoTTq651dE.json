This continuous velocity change creates vortex, which also produces pseudo centrifugal force. The vortex which is particles flowing in continuous change in velocity has an interesting property in which  the speed compared to its size (in ratio) will be surprisingly constant. The velocity is direct and positively proportional to the size of the vortex. <br><br>The vortex in this context is similar to centrifugal force but it&#39;s radius will get smaller as time passes, for the reason why, centrifugal force radius will stay constant and it&#39;s velocity slow down overtime. This will be due to the change in velocity forms a circle at which the distanced traveled at full turn will be 2*pi*r, the circumference of a circle. Removing the radius would give 2*pi, in radians, this is 360 degrees. Dividing it in half would still form a circle if many of it is put together. That&#39;s why centrifugal force is relatively stable, but for the vortex found in turbulent force, it would be quite unstable. Centrifugal force at 1/4 turn would have a 90 degrees or pi/2 in radians but vortex at 1/4 turn would be 95 degrees or 5/3 in radians. The particles at the edge of the vortex would get knocked of making the radius of the vortex get slower overtime.<br><br>This can be observed in turbulent flows at which a particle would change its velocity potentially hitting another particle and that other particle will also change velocity in which the number of collisions increases exponentially and there would be particles forming vortex which could start at any size and slowly decrease in size, or collide with other vortex. The particles that is knocked out of the vortex could potentially form smaller or larger vortex. <br><br>But it might seem that some vortexes would get bigger but it is not really getting bigger. The force is just strong enough that knocked out particles have their velocity change differ quite slightly compared to those particles found in the vortex due to inertia. <br><br>By this, turbulent flow is a state of flow that the velocity of the particles changes continuously and the number of collisions increases exponentially producing vortexes that dissipate over time as long as there&#39;s no significant energy being added/harnessed. <br><br>What you might find mind-blowing in this is that centrifugal force is stable in which at 1/4 turn is 90 degrees, vortext is unstable because it&#39;s more than 90 degrees so it&#39;s radius slowly decreases. So what if the degree is lesser than 90 degrees? The opposite will happen, the radius will increase over time and all of the particles would reach the center, sounds mathematically impossible but it exists, the black hole.", "comment_date": "2022-07-13T09:18:46Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "HeRo TuRtle", "comment_text": "I come to notice, this video is surprisingly &quot;ignored&quot; compared to the usual exposure his videos typically get.", "comment_date": "2022-07-03T03:30:40Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "HeRo TuRtle", "comment_text": "worth pointing out how he&#39;s American, yet consistently uses the metric system even in more &quot;informal&quot; parts.", "comment_date": "2022-07-03T03:25:15Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "HeRo TuRtle", "comment_text": "<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_UoTTq651dE&amp;t=3m48s\">3:48</a> how can it be possible, this airfoil entirely lacks any noticable downwash??", "comment_date": "2022-07-03T03:17:13Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Bijou Smith", "comment_text": "@<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_UoTTq651dE&amp;t=19m04s\">19:04</a> &quot;... suggests there is some predictability...&quot;  is too much of a hedge.

Use of a plane of laser to visual turbulence is similar to an old technique called Schlieren, which examined the shadows of that the eddies (smoke) makes.  It has been used to formally study certain terms in the reduced Navier-Stokes equations.  As to when turbulence is initiated, the Reynolds number is used (in honour of Osborne R.).

The characteristic length term that is within the expression for the Reynolds Number (ratio of inertial forces to viscous forces) is chosen according to the situation or object being studied.

I love this! Ever since I was able to recognize that I had thoughts I saw this &#39;chaos&#39; as beautiful patterns. Nothing is ever the same as something else. You don&#39;t see the same sunset as I do; I am sitting to your left and I have you in my peripheral vision and on my mind and I feel a shoulder on the right side of my chest while I have my arm over your other shoulder. You do not. My molecules share a history with yours, but ever so slightly different. The path for every particle to where it is now is different and all combinations are unique, despite obeying the same natural laws. Those natural laws are what bind us, the paths are unique.<br><br>Another example: The branch of a tree doesn&#39;t &#39;happen&#39; to be there and have that shape and color and composition. It&#39;s the result of genes, wind, sunlight, temperature of the ground and surrounding air, nutrients, water, how much of which was where at what time in what combination and the damage and help that other flora and fauna gave it. All of those are unique, not just for every tree or branch but for every cell and cell division, giving each tree its own unique &#39;character&#39;, showing it&#39;s entire history, all the interactions with all life around it and all particles, the climate, the weather.<br><br>Take a step back and look at the species as a whole and how it developed through time with changing climate and surrounding flora and fauna. Take another step back and see how the planet formed. Step back and see the universe too shape. All the way back to just after the beginning when hydrogen was all there was. - That picture of the background radiation is the earliest baby picture of all of us together that we have; think about that for a second -<br><br>Every leaf and every branch is a logical result of all of our histories and every particle has its own history that&#39;s interconnected with other particles. Every human has their own history that is interconnected with everything else. We&#39;re not random, we&#39;re a logical result. We&#39;re not chaotic either, we are a logical result. Hard and often impossible to predict, yes. There are too many variables for accurate predictions. We simply don&#39;t have and probably will never have perfect knowledge of the initial conditions. That&#39;s also why we still have the relative freedom to make decisions and the responsibility to gather information to make the best possible decisions, while most likely being in an absolutely deterministic universe, where true chaos simply cannot exist.<br><br>All patterns are simply the logical result of our history and I don&#39;t know if the laws of nature are a part of that history or only a cause of it. Maybe there are other universe where at the beginning something was different that resulted in different laws of nature and possibly some of those laws couldn&#39;t work and the universe collapsed and some worked well and went on existing. Who knows? What we do know is that the laws of nature in <i>this</i> universe made everything to be the way it is now, including your thoughts at this very second.<br><br>The history of the entire (visible) universe (and to a lesser extent that of what is not visible anymore but once was connected to the part of the universe we are causally connected to) is in everything you see and think. The entire history of the universe and the history of the person, including everything they ate and the love they received is in the colors and the seemingly chaotic, but definitely unique patterns of the iris of the person you love most. What that history looks like is a mystery, but it is definitely there. You now know the color of the eyes of the person you love and where the specks are in the iris of the person looking back at you. Now take a step back in your mind and look at how you&#39;re interacting with each other and at what you want to do next. Your future is as unique as your history. Choose something. Choose a general direction you want to pursue and choose an action as a step on the path in that direction and do it.", "comment_date": "2018-11-09T07:24:59Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Professor Hasina Banu", "comment_text": "<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_UoTTq651dE&amp;t=8m07s\">8:07</a> Lewis F.

All fluids are compressible, even water (though it&#39;s compressibility is on the order of steel). Air, while highly compressible, can be treated as incompressible in a lot of fluid flow problems. An incompressible flow simply means that the  difference in density at the highest and lowest pressures of the fluid is negligible (as in if the change in density is around 1%, it doesn&#39;t have a significant effect on the flow). <br><br>The generally agreed barrier between incompressible and compressible flows is around 0.4 Mach. This is true because A) Mach and fluid compressibility are integrally related to each other and B) the flow speed of a fluid system represents the lowest pressure (free stream) and highest pressure (stagnation pressure, ie. the pressure when you turn all the fluid&#39;s kinetic energy into pressure). 0.4 Mach generally means it&#39;s around 5% maximum possible change in density, though it could be significantly less depending on the fluid system.<br><br><br>Edit: Great video!
