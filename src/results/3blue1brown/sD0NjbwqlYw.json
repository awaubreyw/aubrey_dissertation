They had seen nothing else. One day, they had the idea to formalize what a human could be. So they looked at the humans directly at their fingertips, and listed different properties to try to characterize them. Since they had living examples of humans satisfying all these properties, it was clear that their properties characterized the humans of Paris. Which meant, in their minds, humans at all (having seen nothing else). One of these properties was &quot;A human necessarily likes cheese&quot;. All humans in Paris satisfied it. But a far-sighted scientist thought that this property did not necessarily seem to be attached to the intrinsic notion of human itself, and that the choice of this property to characterize a human seemed arbitrary. So he tried a new list of properties by removing this property (&quot;like cheese&quot;). He unrolled the implications, and found with surprise that nothing in his calculations opposed the existence of such &quot;objects&quot; (humans not liking cheese). However, the shocked Parisians claimed loud and clear that it was &quot;absurd&quot;, that one had never seen &quot;someone who didn&#39;t like cheese&quot;, and &quot;that these people couldn&#39;t exist&quot;. It was also heard that &quot;they couldn&#39;t really be human&quot;. The idea was proposed to burn the scientist at the stake. To save his life, he had to flee his hometown and settle elsewhere.\r<br>Time passed, and our scientist finally met humans in distant lands who did not like cheese. So he had found an example of existing objects, satisfying the properties he had posed. He returned to his city and presented them to the Parisians. The skepticism was palpable. They looked at them very fixedly. Then, after several days of observation, they finally had to face the facts: there were real humans who did not like cheese. Although this property seemed intuitive and natural to them, the facts seemed to show that their intuition (probably conditioned by their environment) was wrong. It now seemed very unreasonable to redefine the notion of human, to exclude those who did not like cheese. Because in them, everything worked almost like the humans they were used to. Time passed, and it was finally accepted that these individuals were indeed humans. They settled down and eventually settled in Paris. With even more time, it turned out that these humans even made an important civic contribution (through their work, knowledge and skills, ...) to this new, and richer, beautiful city of Paris. \ud83d\ude43", "comment_date": "2022-08-03T20:28:30Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Yonatan", "comment_text": "Now that you beautifully explained it to me, i can go ahead solve the big question.", "comment_date": "2022-07-31T22:25:06Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Tletna", "comment_text": "This is a great video.

A stupid scholar all overturned this truth and built it to a convenient system of Mason. Thus, the people believe the trickery of the devil than words of God. Darwin&#39;s evolutionary theory, the Copernican theory of Galileo, the theory of relativity, quantum mechanics, mathematics, the medicine of Einstein are all errors. A ghost, a UFO, supernatural power, the miracle of God to be said to be the occult are rather true. A thing and a ghost (God) exist in the world, and space is active by spiritual power (conception) of God. As for God, all things were created by the soul of language. It is clear if I read the Bible. Because the present scholar mixes the logic thoroughly in human wisdom, it cannot arrive at the truth. It is intuitive power to be important. Why does a child seem to be? The thing which cannot answer this is a mistake. Our common sense is more right than a stupid scholar. The creation of God comes loose only by a fate. Everything becomes the material by a conception of God (person).<br> <br>I cannot prove 1+1 = 2 in a numerical formula. I can prove only a physical phenomenon to say that it is in two apples when I match another one apple with one apple. It is not 0+1 \u2260 1. As 0 (nothing) is not quality, you must not handle it for a number. Because quality is different even if I match a mandarin orange with an apple, there is not a meaning of the addition. Because it does not exist other than God when I define God as existence, no (0) does not exist. Because the mathematics defines 0, negative number, imaginary number, \u221e which do not exist in the world, it is an error and is a fiction. A number is to count quality. When I am separated from a physical phenomenon, the mathematics does not have the significance of being.<br><br>\u203bIf 0 exists by a definition of the mathematics, 0 of the infinity must exist. However, the infinite space, infinity do not exist. In other words, because the mathematics defines 0, negative number, imaginary number, \u221e which do not exist, it is an error and is a fiction. Therefore it is an error because a zeta function, the numerical formula of the second oiler product deal with this infinity. That it becomes sum of series \u03a3 = 1+2+3+ ... = - 1/12 of the natural number, or the product of all prime numbers is 4\u03c0^2. It turns out that it is an error if I think for common sense. It is limited, and the mathematician seems to get a wrong this, but uses the sophism when I calculate this endlessly if right. This is a mistake of the definition of 0 or \u221e and is the evidence that mathematics gets a wrong. It is definition f&#39;(x) = limh of the differential calculus that must not divide it by 0 \u2192 0 {the same as it being 0 that says that I bring h close to 0 without a limit, and dividing it by a numerical formula of f(x+h)-f(x)}/h. I divide it by 0. The mathematics is trickery not study in this way.<br><br> All the origins of the scientific theory are random, and a bottom is broken. For example, in the theory of elementary particles, an electron joins atoms together and becomes the molecules. A thing joining a proton and a neutron together is a mesotron, and three quarks connect the proton, and there is it. An electron and a positron (antimatter) occur from a photon. An elementary particle to tie the elementary particle to whenever a new elementary particle is discovered is necessary and loses the relations with an elementary particle and the elementary particle more and more. Though a proton and the neutron are the same mass, why does a difference occur in having electric charge or not? The science has no answer with it in these questions. An electron is a material so that I think, and the positron is not a material in the hole of the material loss that the circumference was surrounded by in the soul children. In other words, the antimatter is an illusion. The scholar is going to examine it logically and loses sight of the truth. The structure of built nature of God is simpler, but is the thing which it is hard to understand in the human wisdom. A photon seems to have a particle and the two characteristics of the wave, but, in fact, the light has the property of the wave with the soul body.<br><br> Message from the spiritual world of Einstein <br> When oneself saw a scene of heaven through a tunnel of the light in the meantime, the person who experienced suspended animation well is you after the revival. The moving speed of the soul does not receive gravitational restraint anymore, and, as for the law of the speed of light immutability that I discovered during the lifetime, there are none in the world of the consciousness. In other words, I will say that it just moves to say that I think. Furthermore, it is just handed down to a partner to have thought. The life of all of us shares what one interiority. And the material is to say that it was actually consciousness. There are all things in your heart, and, also, you are existence to live in a heart of all life. When all of this space watches it with eyes, it is seen like the outside world, but is to say that the world to be actually seen outside is your interiority. The relativity disappears in here, and this space consists based on &quot;universal truth to certainly say to call God&quot;. <br><br> Near future to read from revelation and illuminati card of God of days, and to untie it in Japan<br> April, 2020 xx day The United States bombs North Korea.

I conquer the world in the life of the hell of the cruel survival of the fittest and am useless even if only oneself is going to be saved. Because a killed animal retaliates for a human being, cancer occurs. The meat which I ate becomes the blood, and a vindictive spirit dwells in a cell when blood does formation to a cell. A human being is cruel, and a fornication, a falsehood, committing theft, the habit of the evil deed of the luxury are not stopped. Eating meat is indirect killing. Why is God that existence of the evil is permitted? It lets you compensate for a human crime by the devil. A disaster, an epidemic, the war damage are the wrath of Heaven. Because a Japanese savior buys the crime of the world people, it is sacrificed. I fall in the trees and plants in spite of the pains then even if I writhe with a hell if it is just and changes the heart and does not straighten an act to measure up to hearts of God.

A stupid scholar all overturned this truth and built it to a convenient system of Mason. Thus, the people believe the trickery of the devil than words of God. What is called brainwashing without expressing brainwashing in this? Darwin&#39;s evolutionary theory, the Copernican theory of Galileo, the theory of relativity, quantum mechanics, mathematics, medicine, the genetic engineering (the gene is the soul of language as for the gene a tool) of Einstein are all errors. A ghost, a UFO (as for the alien a lie), supernatural power, a miracle, telepathy of God, the moment movement to be said to be the occult are rather true. A thing and a ghost (God) exist in the world, and space is active by spiritual power (conception) of God. As for God, all things were created by the soul of language. It is clear if I read the Bible. Because the present scholar mixes the logic thoroughly in human wisdom, it cannot arrive at the truth. It is intuitive power to be important. Why does a child seem to be? The thing which cannot answer this is a mistake. Our common sense is more right than a stupid scholar. The creation of God comes loose only by a fate. Everything becomes the material by a conception of God (person).<br><br>I cannot prove 1+1 = 2 in a numerical formula. I can prove only a physical phenomenon to say that it is in two apples when I match another one apple with one apple. An apple becomes extinct suddenly and does not become 1+1 = 2 like an operation of the other self if a number is quality to increase. It is not 0+1 \u2260 1. As 0 (nothing) is not quality, you must not handle it for a number. Because quality is different even if I match a mandarin orange with an apple, there is not a meaning of the addition. Because it does not exist other than God when I define God as existence (integer), no (0) does not exist.<br><br>If 0 exists by a definition of the mathematics, 0 of the infinity must exist. However, infinite space is infinite (\u221e) and does not exist either. In other words, because the mathematics defines 0, negative number, imaginary number, \u221e which do not exist, it is an error and is a fiction. Therefore it is an error because a zeta function, the numerical formula of the second oiler product deal with this infinity. That it becomes sum of series \u03a3 = 1+2+3+ ... = - 1/12 of the natural number, or the product of all prime numbers is 4\u03c0^2. It turns out that it is an error if I think for common sense. It is limited, and the mathematician seems to get a wrong this, but uses the sophism when I calculate this endlessly if right. This is mistake definition of 0or \u221e and is the evidence that mathematics gets a wrong. It is definition f&#39;(x) = limh of the differential calculus that must not divide it by 0 \u2192 0 {the same as it being 0 that says that I bring h close to 0 without a limit, and dividing it by a numerical formula of f(x+h)-f(x)}/h. I divide it by 0. The mathematics is trickery not study in this way.<br><br>It was done that Einstein who hit the contradiction of the uncertainness theory that became the quantum-mechanical basics returned by contradiction of own theory of relativity and defeated it. When Mitsuko of the one of the boxes of a theory, the light jumps out of a shutter, a spring shrinks, and a box lightens, and true time becomes uncertain because time advances if mass by the theory of relativity lightens. Therefore I concluded that an uncertain theory was right. The principle of constancy of light velocity of Einstein is an error, and the special theory of relativity from it is a mistake, too. Thus, the quantum mechanics is blague.<br><br>I find out a lie of Einstein<br><br>UFOA took off in speed of light C from 0 spots to the right direction, and UFOB took off at the same time in speed of light C from 0 spots to the left direction. In A, B arrived at the point of Ckm from 0 spots to the left at the point of Ckm from 0 spots to the right one second later. The distance of the meantime is 2Ckm. The speed to see UFOB becomes double speed of light C from UFOA. This is right than it is measured in a speedometer. The principle of constancy of light velocity is an error. In other words, the theory of relativity is a lie. I know it even if I think about such a thing for common sense. A law of the addition of the speed is why and is applicable to a material, and is it not applicable to light? Naturally it is applicable to light. Time stops when I exercise in speed of light, and mass becomes infinite. Why is so; cannot examine it. In other words, such a thing is a lie.<br><br>Message of the spiritual world of Einstein <br><br>When oneself saw a scene of heaven through a tunnel of the light in the meantime, the person who experienced suspended animation well is you after the revival. The moving speed of the soul does not receive gravitational restraint anymore, and, as for the law of the speed of light immutability that I discovered during the lifetime, there are none in the world of the consciousness. In other words, I will say that it just moves to say that I think. Furthermore, it is just handed down to a partner to have thought. The life of all of us shares what one interiority. And the material is to say that it was actually consciousness. There are all things in your heart, and, also, you are existence to live in a heart of all life. When all of this space watches it with eyes, it is seen like the outside world, but is to say that the world to be actually seen outside is your interiority. The relativity disappears in here, and this space consists based on &quot;universal truth to certainly say to call God&quot;. <br><br><br>The scientists equal to my younger student arrive at an outbreak point of the space named the BIC barn from my formula and seem to argue variously, but, as for it, do not have a meaning too much. This is because it is in one, and an infinite opening and all properties that a phase contradicts it at all called at the infinite end and the eternity exist in this space. In other words, it includes the whole (God) at the same time that it is 1, and it is a religious concept to say that the whole is 1 (God) at the same time.<br><br>\u203bLet&#39;s prove that the Copernican theory of Galileo is a lie<br><br>I should be able to observe movement to rotate of the earth from a flying airplane, but seem to hardly move. The atmosphere and the airplane are at one with the earth and do not rotate. Because the wind blows from all directions of north, south, east and west, the atmosphere is not restricted on the earth. Because freedom can navigate the airplane in the atmosphere, I am not restricted by the atmosphere. The botfly flew lightly when I observed the state that threw a botfly in the airplane which was surely flying, and flew without being affected by the inertial force that the weight of the botfly by the speed of the airplane brought about. This is evidence to say that I do not produce the inertial force in the airplane shut in. In other words, mind (even if I make a vacuum like) of the space before and after the horsefly denies an inertial force. An air pocket after the object exercises creates the inertial forces. Therefore an inertial force acts forward if an inertial force acts after the airplane and slows down suddenly. However, the atmosphere on the earth flows in the state that is not pasted on the earth freely. Therefore the driving force of the airplane damps by just that much if an airplane navigates it against the inertial force (by the centrifugal force) to the east direction by the rotation of the earth to the west direction. As for the inertial force that the rotation of the earth of 1,700km per an hour produces, it is thought about with a considerably big thing enough an airplane not being able to move.<br><br>The speed of the rotation of the earth of the neighborhood of equator is 1,700km per an hour. If the ground moves at this speed when an airplane lands, the airplane is completely demolished by the shock. The reason why it is not completely demolished is that the earth does not rotate.<br><br>The ball draws a righthander and can bend into the partner on a merry-go-round of rotating it anticlockwise when I pass a ball. If shoot a mark, can bend with a rifle in the same way; and there is not the thing equal to the mark.<br><br>All the origins of the scientific theory are random, and a bottom is broken. For example, in the theory of elementary particles, an electron joins atoms together and becomes the molecules. A thing joining a proton and a neutron together is a mesotron, and three quarks connect the proton, and there is it. An electron and a positron (antimatter) occur from a photon. An elementary particle to tie the elementary particle to whenever a new elementary particle is discovered is necessary and loses the relations with an elementary particle and the elementary particle more and more. Though a proton and the neutron are the same mass, why does a difference occur in having electric charge or not? The science has no answer with it in these questions. An electron is a material so that I think, and the positron is not a material in the hole of the material loss that the circumference was surrounded by in the soul children. In other words, the antimatter is an illusion. The scholar is going to examine it logically and loses sight of the truth. The structure of built nature of God is simpler, but is the thing which it is hard to understand in the human wisdom.

All it really means is that we are defining the existence of a value outside of a single dimension in which it does not exist.  When we process a vector (one dimension) with another vector (one dimension) that is defined with parameters that do not exist for the first vector, we add another dimension to our understanding of each vector to create a space in which we can parameterize both vectors.  This higher dimensional understanding comes with newer processes that are similar to processes in a single dimension.  This process leads to naming each new dimension with basis vectors called i-hat, j-hat, k-hat, etc.<br><br>The use of i to denote a new dimension outside of the real number dimension is the same thing as using j-hat to extend understanding from i-hat.  It is clunky to use i in one context to denote a SECOND dimension while using i-hat to denote the FIRST dimension in another context.

The real number graphs (certainly Cartesian coordinate planes, at least for the type of math you do in high school) that deal solely in real numbers are 2 dimensional because you have 1 dimension of input (for example, in the Cartesian system, X) and 1 dimension of output (Y). We can easily see 2 dimensions at once in our 3d world, so we can draw out a function like Y = X^2 and visually observe its essential 2d behaviors - for example, the way it curves upward.<br><br>Just as the 2d function Y = X^2 has a different derivative at each point, so that at smaller values of X it curves more slowly, and at larger values, more rapidly, we&#39;re observing here the differing rates of change in the 4d curvature of the 4d complex function based on differing inputs. Because you&#39;d need 4 dimensions to represent these graphs fully - both the input and output have 2 dimensions each (the real and imaginary components of a complex number). All we can do is show them side by side. The 2d analogue of this would be to represent the function Y = X^2 with two lines; one line for the input values, and one line for the output values.<br><br>With these two lines you would observe that, for smaller inputs, the output doesn&#39;t move away as quickly (e.g. at X = 1, Y = 1, so it didn&#39;t move at all) but for larger values of X, you&#39;d see the value on the output line moves away much more rapidly (e.g. if you have X = 2 on the input line, for the output line you would be at 4, which moved away more rapidly). So we&#39;re observing two distinct sets of one-dimensional movements - the first, the movement along the input line, testing different input values; and the second, the movement on the output line, to see how the outputs behave relative to the inputs.<br><br>In the same way, for the 4d complex function, 3blue1brown&#39;s diagram here shows two distinct sets of two dimensional movements, because we have to break single 4d function into two 2d graphs, one for the inputs, and one for the outputs, just as I cited the example of breaking a 2d graph into one 1d line for input, and one 1d line for output. So this 2d &quot;spiralling&quot; movement as he goes from the 2d input plane to the 2d output plane is analogous to the 1d &quot;stretching&quot; we&#39;d see as we went from the 1d input line to the 2d output line, for Y = X^2 in this example.<br><br>I suspect that just as, for the 2d function Y = X^2, we&#39;d see more &quot;stretching&quot; as X gets bigger (like I said before, at X = 1, there&#39;s no stretching at all, because the value on the output line is Y =1, because 1^2 = 1; then at 2 on the input line, we stretch to 4 on the output line, then at 3 on the input line we stretch to 9 on the output line, and so forth - increasingly rapid &quot;stretching&quot;), the increasingly rapid spiralling as we go from certain parts of the 2d input plane to the 2d output plane corresponds to the 4d curvature that&#39;s actually going on. This is the same way Y = X^2 exhibits a 2d curvature, that you can easily see, the way it curves upward precipitously at an increasing rate for increasing values of X.<br><br>I might be wrong on this next part, but I would guess we can observe the effect more easily by focusing on one distinct point at a time in the 2d input plane, and seeing how it translates to the 2d output plane (well obviously that much is correct; it&#39;s his own recommendation). So (and here&#39;s where I might be wrong but I think I&#39;m right) we see when inputting the imaginary value i into the function f(s) = s^2, we get a 90 degree curvature over to the output, which is -1. Then, when s = -1, putting it into the same function instead gives us a 180 degree curvature, over to +1. I believe this is just like how going from 1 to 2, in the 2d example, we see greater stretching from the input line to the output line with bigger input values. Whereas before it was a difference in 1 dimensional &quot;stretch&quot;, here it&#39;s a different in 2d rotation. The 1 dimensional stretch was used in the representation of a 2d function; this 2d rotation is used in the representation of a 4d function.<br><br>The reason I felt I might be wrong is because surely you don&#39;t just spiral along this one unit circle, because that might suggest that you get the same degree of movement dependent only on one dimension of input (the imaginary dimension in this case?) so that even with inputs that have different real components, it&#39;s the same rotational movement from one input to another. Clearly, of course, the &quot;real&quot; component (or whatever it is I&#39;m missing) also influences the transformation from the 2d input plane to the 2d output plane. Perhaps I&#39;m correct in supposing that one of the dimensions of the transformation from the input to the output planes is rotation, and maybe the other is a &quot;stretching&quot; component predicated on the real components of the inputs, as in how an input with a certain real component maps over to the output plane compared to another input with a differing real component?<br><br>That last paragraph was convoluted, I don&#39;t quite understand my own confusion and I&#39;ve already typed too much. But I just think it&#39;s really fascinating how what we&#39;re really describing here is a 4d function. I have no doubt mathematicians have extensively tried to describe the 4d nature of this function, e.g. its qualities such as curvature and so forth, and whatever else (if anything else) may exist in 4d that isn&#39;t simply an embellishment of principles that already exist in 3d. But it sure would be way easier to study these if we could only perceive 4d somehow.", "comment_date": "2021-02-21T20:42:14Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "hghfd grrrgd", "comment_text": "The past spleen concurringly guard because humidity socioeconomically remove beneath a smiling deer. impolite, juvenile geography", "comment_date": "2021-02-20T18:35:31Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Great Awakening", "comment_text": "Can someone help me?

His point of view and presentation is flawless and up to the point. 3Blue1Brown nails the gap between rigor and inspiration. His work is monumental to say the least. Math is not about bursts of sudden creativity. Math is about rigor, details, hard work and deductive reasoning. If we want to see math in full detail we simply read books for it however we must communicate that rigor and that clean way of thinking. People need to get rid of the notion that mathematics is hard and impossible to grasp. A well written book and full derivation of the theorems gives the right idea of what mathematics is about. Brown illustrates with pure accuracy the beauty of mathematics. There&#39;s no boring video in his channel. <br><br><br>The right balance of development of theorems, proofs, full derivations and clean deductions should be intertwined with illustration inspiration and comprehension of these concepts. 3Blue1Brown established a precedent and quality that will remain unmatched in decades to come. His contribution to the community is beyond anything we&#39;ve seen in modern times. His work inspire others to illustrate, prove and combine images on those long cryptic proofs on the books. The education of mathematics is of vital importance for the advancement of technology, problem solving in all branches of engineering and architecture. 3Blue1Brown became an institution on itself. An institution that deserves the attention and recognition for all the hard work this community of mathematicians invested in us. <br><br><br>What his channel does is something so wonderful and well known called EDUCATION.

You noted how the Zeta function, of the kind shown, maps the argand grid into orthogonal geodesics &quot;in the plane&quot;. So why, in the pursuit of a proof of Riemann,  do so many folks want to jump into the higher space of quaternions? Is it because the plane is so well arithmetized that the Riemann &#39;hypothesis&#39; is just a Godel sentence that while true cannot be proven within that space and logic? If so, where does anyone get the assuring sense that adding arithmetical dimensions in a continuation of consistency will push the Godel sentence into the status of a non-Godel sentence in that domain? The constraints of analytic continuation may be the very thing that always ensures the sort of consistency that keeps the Godel sentence unprovable whether in an S symmetry or E8 . Maybe someone needs to think outside the box of analytic continuation and think of the &#39;anomalous&#39; roots (prime numbers) as key elements of a buried probability theory. To me a clue in that direction might be that the most efficient primality tests seem to compete as probability estimates (which I guess is where theory of distributions may get you). The observed fact that the number of primes  up to n approaches n/ln(n)  is rather suggestive of the related roots of entropy and information theory (again, probability theory for coding).

Pin the common point of the two unit circles at (1; 0)<br>such that this point is restricted from moving.<br>5. Reduce the diameter of one of the unit circles by half.<br>This creates an inner circle of diameter i vertically and<br>diameter x horizontally, which is pegged/pinned to the<br>larger unit circle at point (1; 0):<br>6. This pegged inner circle is identical in every respect to<br>the larger parent unit circle except it has been scaled to<br>half the size of the larger unit circle.<br>7. The origin of the parent unit circle assumes various<br>equivalent values<br> Cartesian: zero, plus or minus 1<br> Fermatian: zero, limit, derivative, maxima, minima,<br> plus and minus 1, one half, i<br><br> Newtonian: zero, shrinking the 2i secant to zero= i = limit = derivative = maxima = minima:<br><br> Inner Circle shift: The (-1; 0) point of the reduced<br> circle now occupies the origin of the larger         parent   circle.<br><br>8. The origin of the reduced/inner circle is identical to the<br>origin of the larger parent circle. They differ only in<br> location.<br><br>9. Thus since i = 0 then the entirety of the i diameter of<br>the reduced /inner circle is, and must be, zero.<br>10. The same result may be obtained by shrinking the 2i<br>diameter/secant of the parent circle to the length of the<br>i = zero diameter/secant of the inner circle.<br>11. Thus the i diameter comprises the critical line and since<br>its entirety is composed of zeroes then these zeroes are,<br>obligatorily, non trivial zeroes.<br>12. Given step 7 and Figure 2.0.1, i is equivalent to the  tangent = m = slope.<br>13.

That is what this 30 is asking for the Ramon&#39;s at the function wants to know literally creation how the black hole and how does matter changes from one state to another. The only math I did do was very simple to prove that the system really is symmetrical and conservative. Once I calculate exactly 1 proving that there was no power loss in the change of state and the system really is symmetrical I came across your video and realized but this is exactly what I have done it already had the graph drawn the and it matches yours almost exactly except yours is wrong because you don&#39;t have the right numbers and every prerequisite that you mentioned I believe I have met accidentally.

Why would you think that 1 + 2 + 3 + ... is not -1/12? What proof do you have? You must add axioms to the finitely lengthed sum axioms - so you&#39;re obviously not dealing with something that should even be called a sum to prevent misleading. For example, a proof involving the right side being greater than 1 or 2 because there are no negatives being added to it would have to use some made up axiom for infinitely many inductive addition expressions being transitive, which has no mathematical reasoning except human bias with algebraic notation. Convergence is a statement about error and provides a definition for a misleading enumeration called &#39;infinite sum&#39; in traditional math, which obviously isn&#39;t actually a sum, but a convergence statement. (hence the quotes) If you don&#39;t believe me then just look it up on wikipedia. The formal definition is listed there. Then we have this video asserting continuity and we also have Ramanujan adding simple axioms to get a finite result of -1/12. So, nature points in apparently multiple ways, but they&#39;re all just one, that it&#39;s -1/12.

So, back to the video, when they take the function that is defined on a domain where it &quot;works&quot; and extend it to the rest of the complex plan , where it isnt defined , does that make any sense , or is it just pure imagination?<br>(and i&#39;m not speaking of how they extend it, that i understand, but i&#39;m realy asking about the meaning of it all) <br>Thanks for taking the time to read and reply.", "comment_date": "2017-02-20T23:29:23Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "specific impulse", "comment_text": "why cant you just reflect the function?", "comment_date": "2017-02-17T00:43:11Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Stephan Kuerner", "comment_text": "Forgiveness - but it lacks the half", "comment_date": "2017-02-16T17:51:19Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Wren", "comment_text": "If I had to imagine it being anything, it would spacetime. but that&#39;s my scifi brain at work", "comment_date": "2017-02-16T10:48:39Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Warren Fletcher", "comment_text": "As a Control Engineer.

No matter what your exponent is, a base 1 will be 1 raised to any power. Therefore, the first term of this is always 1/1, which simplifies to 1. If the first term is 1, and you add anything, you will get a number greater than one, because 1/n^s cannot be negative without n being negative. And n starts at 1 so n will never be negative.

In this sense, convergent series are just as &quot;evil&quot; as divergent series. You need to come up with the &quot;partial sums approach a limit&quot; construct to get your answer. In fact, there possibly endless such constructs we can come up with (ex: Fourier methods) to get an answer from a convergent series and they all seem somewhat artificial to me. However, they all generally agree on the answer (when they work) which gives merit to the whole framework. I feel like there is something deeper about infinite series (convergent or divergent) that we are all missing the point of.

In the video, it is mentioned that the function is defined at s=-1 not by the original sum, but by the analytical continuation. However, the analytical continuation simply extends the definition of the sum so that it is also defined at -1. Remember, the exponential function f(x) = exp(x) is only originally defined for real arguments. Notwithstanding, we know that exponentiation is now an operation defined for all complex numbers, and we know that e^\u03c0i=-1. Mathematicians do not say that the analytic continuation of the exponential function for x=\u03c0i is evaluated to be -1. Instead, they use the continuation to extend the definition of exponentiation itself and then claim that exp(x)=-1. The definition of infinite sums is not defined in principle for divergent sums. However, we can extend the definition so that infinite sums can be defined also for divergent sums, and rather than saying the evaluation of the analytic continuation of the function that expresses the sum equals a certain value, we prefer to say that the extended definition of the sum allows to say that such divergent sum simply equals such value by said extended definition. Therefore, -1/12 = the sum of all natural numbers because Riemann-Zeta(-1) = -1/12 by its extended definition. The definition itself is extended by the analytical continuation, not just the mapping of the function, in the same way that exponentiation has an extended definition rather than simply an extended mapping from continuation. Because, to say otherwise, it would mean that exponentiation at complex numbers is still not meaningful, yet we can assign numbers to the analytic continuation of exponentiation for all numbers. And that is actually very different and very painful. That would mean that the identity e^\u03c0i=-1 is false since exponentials for complex numbers are undefined. For this type of reasoning to be consistent, we either need to give that and many other identities, or we have to declare that the Riemann-Zeta Function has an extended definition which makes divergent sums meaningful within the context of finite complex numbers. The latter is simply preferable due to mathematical convenience.", "comment_date": "2016-12-23T07:46:11Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Laff700", "comment_text": "Saying 1+2+3+4+5+6+7+...=-1/12 is like saying the position of an object whose initial position on a line and velocity were 0m and 0.5m/s respectively would have the position of -1/12m after \u221e seconds have passed where the object is accelerating at 1m/s^2.

Its a great animation, so its just a thought i have.", "comment_date": "2016-12-09T18:24:02Z", "likes_count": 2}, {"comment_by": "Yash Pandey", "comment_text": "understanding it is way more beautiful and mind blowing than that million dollar prize!!", "comment_date": "2016-12-09T18:22:23Z", "likes_count": 326}, {"comment_by": "Philip M", "comment_text": "Amazing!!!", "comment_date": "2016-12-09T18:22:12Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "perivesta", "comment_text": "These animations are nuts!

Even I don&#39;t know exactly how it works but it relates a lot to vector transformations and also parametric equations. If you take a set of connected line segments that make up an open polygon and connect their midpoints, including the start and end points of the first and last line segments, respectively, you get a new set of line segments that make a new open polygon. Continuing this process, a curve is created that begins to approximate some curve relating to the original open polygon, but I don&#39;t really now EXACTLY what it says about the original polygon. All I can really say so far is that it represents something about the tendency of movement of the polygon from start to end. Seeing this process happen in real time is really cool and if you&#39;d like to talk to me about it, I can tell you what I have discovered so far about the process and what the curve represents.", "comment_date": "2016-12-09T18:07:30Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "mechwarreir2", "comment_text": "Here&#39;s a challenge, try doing a visualization video on a topic of Abstract Algebra or Algebraic Geometry, these fields are just so impenetrably abstract.", "comment_date": "2016-12-09T18:06:08Z", "likes_count": 151}, {"comment_by": "coulie27", "comment_text": "fantastic, thanks for making", "comment_date": "2016-12-09T18:03:19Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Max Buskirk", "comment_text": "Ye 2nd?", "comment_date": "2016-12-09T17:52:05Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "The Physicist Cuber", "comment_text": "first...or  not?", "comment_date": "2016-12-09T17:51:40Z", "likes_count": 0}]
