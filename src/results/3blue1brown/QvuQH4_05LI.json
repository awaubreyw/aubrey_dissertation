It&#39;s not an equation with a problem on one side and a solution on the other.  Yo solve problems correctly you need to be able to see and understand the relationships between all the interacting parts of the environment that the problem exists in, you then alter the environment so that the problem disappears.  Solutions always make the problem disappear.  This is also different from solving a puzzle which is also not a problem.  Please do not describe puzzles as problems because they are not.  It&#39;s very important that you understand that solving a &quot;puzzle&quot; is not solving a &quot;problem&quot;, and finding an &quot;answer&quot; to a mathematical &quot;equation&quot; is also not solving a &quot;problem&quot;.  It does confuse people though so its important that it is clarified.

Of course exploiting the format is not good problem solving, but in this case it&#39;s valid as the real question is not what the exact value, but what range it falls in. As such, there are legitimate problem solving techniques to answer this question. What you&#39;d do is also define an infinite series describing the probability of it being odd, so that partial evaluation of it defines an upper bound, while partial evaluation of the original series gives a lower bound. You only need to evaluate a finite number of terms in both series before the bounds fall in one of the given ranges. As a result, one can avoid actually finding an exact solution to the infinite series, which requires much more powerful mathematical tools like analysis. In practice, such approximate solutions are enough for many real world problems, and in mathematical problems as well as something like ln(2) is just symbols, but knowing you can compute an arbitrary close upper and lower bound makes it well-defined. Lastly, it works a rigorous check. If the means for computing the bounds were logically valid, than it&#39;s guaranteed to be able to confirm if the calculated value is within bounds, while the Monte-Carlo simulation only give a probabilistic estimate.", "comment_date": "2021-05-12T19:41:49Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "CAG2", "comment_text": "So I worked out the exact value of p for the first question.

I don&#39;t know if anyone else has struggled with this, but my very (at times problematically) literal-definitions-oriented brain decided to experience a moment of cognitive dissonance.

Took me about ten minutes of inner yelling to realize that you had mentioned the floor function, and that your explanation considers &quot;rounding down&quot; and the floor function to be at least analogous.

But once I&#39;m done with that and get the solution, I like to come back to the point where I deliberately chose one side of the equation as describing a quantity, and not some other thing, so as to look at it in two different ways. And then, I ask myself the equation that I&#39;m after never told me to treat both sides as the same quantity..  It just means, that any interpretation of the two sides of the equation have to be equal. For example,  even if one side is treated as area and other as length, if the equation holds, they must have the same magnitude... <br>Note that I am NOT saying that area and length can be equal, they are totally different ideas, but the the ones to choose them are we and unless we restrict us to not including the notion of ONLY MAGNITUDES..<br><br>  Just for an example, consider a seemingly simple equation 3 \u00d7 4 = 12 <br>Consider both sides as lengths... You can imagine 3 being a scale factor for 4 m that gives out 12 m ( You have 3 rods of length 4m placed right after each other and you have total 12 m of rod)<br>BUT<br>Another way you can look at it is take LHS to be area of a rectangle of sides 3 m and 4 m, and RHS as just length, just because the equation also says &quot;magnitude of length of a 12 m long rod and the magnitude of an area of a 3 by 4 rectangle also MUST be equal&quot;..  Just another way of looking at it...  All I really want to say is an equation tells more truths about nature if we break the barrier of treating both sides as the same quantity though it may not be directly helpful in solving the particular problem or decoding what it means.<br><br>And this can be generalized to more complicated looking mathematical equations not just the one I mentioned above...  <br>I believe the more ways we have to look at the same thing, the more beautiful it appears in maths...<br><br>I&#39;d love to know others&#39; views on this too..<br><br>By the way, Grant, You do an unbelievably amazing job explaining mathematical ideas and concepts...", "comment_date": "2020-06-07T12:33:34Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Renz Aclan", "comment_text": "I didn&#39;t know Conan O&#39;brien can do math lol", "comment_date": "2020-06-07T09:19:17Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Gireesh Bhat", "comment_text": "Sir your lectures are really great please teach for IIT Jee Advanced Mathematics", "comment_date": "2020-06-07T03:49:56Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Fernando Henrique Matos", "comment_text": "I wish I was high on pot enuse", "comment_date": "2020-06-06T15:43:27Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Merveil Meok", "comment_text": "Awesooooommmme.", "comment_date": "2020-06-06T06:54:54Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Creative Club", "comment_text": "Make a video on competitive mathematics \u2665\ufe0f", "comment_date": "2020-06-06T06:45:56Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Creative Club", "comment_text": "Make a video on competitive mathematics \u2665\ufe0f", "comment_date": "2020-06-06T06:45:32Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "be TRUE", "comment_text": "\ud83d\udc8b\ud83d\udc8b\ud83d\udc8b", "comment_date": "2020-06-06T04:41:13Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Steven", "comment_text": "I&#39;m interested in producing videos for teaching this fall.

I won&#39;t describe the actual problem here, but it was one where I had to find a way to arrange a bunch of objects in a grid such that given constraints were satisfied. Imagine that it was related to something one might study in combinatorics.<br>What initially made the problem difficult was having an overwhelming number of options to try. There were so many ways to arrange the pieces, almost all of which fail to meet the constraints.  I keep trying to use trial and error, but over and over and over kept running into dead ends: given how I already tried to place half the pieces, there was no valid way to place the remaining pieces.<br>Then I changed my approach. I tried assuming the solution would be as beautiful and symmetric as possible. That meant assuming additional constraints on the problem, beyond those originally given. This could well not work, simply leading to the new version of the problem having no solution at all. But having no other clear way to proceed, this was worth a try. In my case, assuming those additional constraints served to quite significantly reduce the number of possibilities I&#39;d need to try. It reduced the possibilities so much that I was able to use trial and error to find a working solution within just a few more minutes. That was satisfying.<br>This is probably not a problem solving approach that in general will work very often.

When I started college, I dabbled into competitive programming. Which is essentially solving math problems through coding. And we had thia little group where we would solve problems together, contest-style, and then at the end everyone would explain problems they managed to solve. I was one of the new guys in the group, and because I wasn&#39;t a very good student in highschool, I was among the worst problem solvers there. And there wad this one guy in that group who was visibly better than anyone else. He had these absolutely crazy ideas of applying some seemingly completely unrelated concepts for certain problems and I remember looking at him at the blackboard and thinking &quot;How the hell is this guy getting these ideas? He is so smart&quot;. And then one day I decided I wanted to become good, too. And I started solving problems on various sites. I solved over 2000 problems that year. And as I was solving them, I found myself reading about a lot of theorems and algorithms, which were needed to solve these problems. And eventually I became one of the best competitive programmers in my country, with some decent international results too. I remember I got to team up with that guy I was talking about for some contests, and I felt extremely honored. I felt like I&#39;d achieved my goal of getting to his level. And I feel like the problem solving skills I gained along the way helped me a lot in real-life decisions. This whole deal happened about 5 years ago, and I had plenty of time to notice how I have taken a very different approach to what I do when faced with a life-altering decision than how I used to do it back then. Anyway, the moral of the story is: if you want to become a good problem solver, just solve a lot of problems.

I never really knew where most the different trigonometric came from. I didn&#39;t have to really, remembered them or looked them up. I even studied a heavily math centered subject and later informatics with a focus on 3d graphics, so i use trigonometrie a lot. I might know some things by heart but that&#39;s usually just because something is computationally quicker, not because i actually know how to proof it by fiddling around in a unit circle like  you did today.

By following a systematic and disciplined method one can make sense of a complicated practical system and solve for all kinds of unknowns. We always define our system, draw a diagram, look for symmetry, find alternate expressions for variables, plot data to look for connections and so on. And the teaching process is designed to take us from simple problems to more complex ones, but often the key to a tricky problem is to imagine a simplified or extreme case (&#39;what it [x] were zero, or infinite?&#39;) and generalise from there.

And so it might have been nice to point out at the very beginning, that it&#39;s already proven that such a procedure cannot exist (precise formulation of the problem was to find a formal procedure, that for any statement in a mathematical theory would indicate whether the statement is true or false), so tips is all that we can ever hope for.

One of them was Alan Turing (who imagined the famous Turing Machine and used it for this very proof) and Alonzo Church (who used his own invention of Lambda Calculus). They actually met later and together proved that both solutions are equivalent to each other (if I remember correctly it was Turing&#39;s PhD thesis and Church was his supervisor), laying foundation for modern computer science, especially programming. Actually all modern programming languages are in one way or another based either on Turing Machine or Lambda Calculus.", "comment_date": "2020-05-22T20:44:36Z", "likes_count": 50}, {"comment_by": "Rohit Rawat", "comment_text": "I wonder how long did it take you to think through and prepare these lectures.", "comment_date": "2020-05-22T20:40:52Z", "likes_count": 11}, {"comment_by": "AtmosFEAR", "comment_text": "Are you planning on doing &quot;essence of group theory&quot;?.Since I&#39;m sure it&#39;s filled with geometric intuition that your lively animations can help foster.<br>P.s-PLEASE DO IT.Also just in case you see this comment.Mind telling us about all the books on that shelf?:D", "comment_date": "2020-05-22T20:35:47Z", "likes_count": 432}, {"comment_by": "Alex Fwfwfw", "comment_text": "Question: In the function f(x)=x^x, why the minimum value for the function is 1/e, why &#39;e&#39; appears here?", "comment_date": "2020-05-22T20:35:22Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "manjula mahesh", "comment_text": "Hello, thank you for sharing the lesson, I enjoy it!
