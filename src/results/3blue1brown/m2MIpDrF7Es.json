Maths has always been an intimidating obstacle I&#39;ve stumbled at, I guess, since I never really found a mentor and then didn&#39;t pursue a mathematical subject in university. Recently my interest in maths has been revitalised, and I have been making more progress in &quot;actually getting what maths is about&quot; in a deeper sense. I feel a big part of that is because of resources such as this that are able to point me toward insights I might never stumble across otherwise. I am very grateful", "comment_date": "2020-05-23T20:12:11Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "mary rowe", "comment_text": "you should make a video about the square root of i.", "comment_date": "2020-05-19T00:37:30Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Red Six", "comment_text": "I dont think your formula at <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m2MIpDrF7Es&amp;t=12m48s\">12:48</a> works.

For every interval of size 1, the rate of increase of 2^(1/10)^t is some fixed proportion of itself. But it&#39;s obvious 2^(1/10)^t is simply the curve 2^t stretched out horizontally by a factor of 10 because you can chop that 1/10th into hundredth roots - as fine as you like. That the curve n^t is smooth and always increasing sort of follows from the fact that you can  chop it up in this way.<br><br>But wait - what if the 29th roots of 2 followed a completely different path to the 31st roots of 2? This doesn&#39;t happen, because we can take the lowest common multiple of 29 and 31 and make a curve of the 891th rooths of 2. This has a nice smooth stepwise curve, and the curves traced out by the 31st and the 29rth roots all lie on it. But we are still working only with rational numbers.<br><br>With respect to the value of e, I stated with the idea that if this constant is a constant over the whole curve, then its average over an  interval of the curve must be greater than the value at the sart of the interval, and less than the value at the end of the interval. And the avreage over an interval is simply the slope of the line connecting the two points. <br><br>We can demonstrate by inspecting the curves that the constant of proportionality for 2^t must be &lt; 1, because the average <b>height</b> of the curve 2^t between 1 and 0 is &gt;1, but the average <b>rate of growth</b> of 2^t between 0 and 1 is 1.<br><br>Similarly, we can demonstrate by inspection that the constant of proportionality for 3^x must be &gt;1, because the average <b>rate of growth</b> between 0 and 1 is 2, but the average <b>height</b> is slightly &lt;2 because the curve has a curve to it. <br><br> If we the proportionality constant is a smooth increasing function of the base, then there must be some number between 2 and 3 for which this constant is unity, and there you go.", "comment_date": "2018-12-21T09:07:26Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Paul Murray", "comment_text": "One of the important things about e is that although you can make sense of rational exponents of rational numbers in terms of roots, all the numbers 2^a and 3^b - for rational a and b - are incommensurable.

I think the problem here is that it&#39;s the explanation is &quot;backwards&quot;. I would go something along these lines:<br>&quot;In the last videos we looked at ways of calculating derivatives from given functions. However, very often real problems are stated in reverse: we know the derivative (or some property of it) of an unknown function. This leads to &quot;differential equations&quot;, now thi is a complicated, involved topic in the general case. However, we&#39;ll be looking at a &quot;simple&quot; example now, as an introduction and because this case is related to a very important type of function and its derivative.<br>Now you introduce some example: population, where the more people you have the more may be born, investement, cooling, radioactive decay, ...&quot;<br>In all those cases the more we have of a quantity, the faster that quantity will change (increasing or decreasing). This leads to this differential equation.<br>As usual in this series, we are not going to solve this equation symbolically, we&#39;ll look at what the unknown function may look like.<br>You go on to a nice animation showing that (for integers) we get a quantity that gets multiplied over and over again (exponential). So the mystery function coincides with exponenation for integers (and also rationals) but would be a continuous function that would interpolate irrational numbers. We may decide to <i>define</i> exponentation for irrationals (what we do not know how to do) by means of that function [we&#39;ll need a way to evaluate its value in that case, but this is a topic we&#39;ll go back to later in the series], anyway we do know what its graphic would look like. This is a very useful use of calculus, expanding functions, [note, we can also go on to define exponentiation for complex numbers using a similar idea, link to your nice videos about the topic).<br>So, any differential equation of this particular type can be solved with an exponential in some base, we may ask &quot;what&#39;s the relationship between the constant in the equation and the base&quot;. Trying some values we get very strange answers, for example, for the base to be 2 the constant must be 0,..., for it to be 3, it must be .... There doesn&#39;t seem to be a pattern here.<br>We can get a better understanding if you try a related question: what base would we get if the constant was 1?&quot; In that case, we are looking for a function whose derivative is not only proportional but identical to itself! If we zero in on an answer (by trying values around that point) we get a value of 2,.... Yes! that&#39;s the famous numer e! In reality, this is no coincidence. We may thing that this is exactly what the number e is all about!
