We know it works for N=2 thieves with at most N cuts. So, if I were professor I would now write: The rest will follow by inductive logic and is kept for the reader as an exercise \ud83d\ude42<br>But, seriously, how would that work in reality?<br>I guess, it&#39;s upper bounded to 2 * d * N cuts for N=2^d thieves via a divide and conquer strategies (just group into 2 halfs of the gang, apply original solution and then divide further recursively). I have no real good intuition about how it works if non powers of 2. (Is that somehow connected to the chessboard problem?)<br>We probably also can&#39;t take just the Borsak-Ulam theorem to prove an existence in the N &lt;&gt; 2^d cases. I mean, we would need something proving that N points are mapped to the same origin. Would it work on manifolds with gender of N (wholes?) if we construct a clever mapping to such a surface?<br>For at least in computer science, we probably can ensure to have N=2^d processors or threads in case (not so sure if we regard thieves e.g. as different users and want to find an optimal storage solution for them for different entities), so should be a bit less of a practical problem.

It makes me think of a problem I suggested you do a video about a while ago. That&#39;s the breakdown of calculus when trying to solve problems with too many variables, for example finding the impact location of a projectile including air resistance which itself is made up of temperature, density, humidity etc. All solutions are approximations therefor calculus can&#39;t solve the problem elegantly.<br>Here&#39;s my question: perhaps there is an analogous solution like the Borsuk-Ulam theory if say the solutions to that calculus problem w/ air resistance can be mapped to a N dimensional manifold. Perhaps different regions of that manifold could represent different components of the &quot;ideal&quot; or &quot;pure&quot; solution. Maybe one sub dimension represents air temperature while another humidity. In this way a certain temperature would imply a certain humidity and lead to a cleaner solution simply by finding the antipodal point one variable corresponds to. A solution like this would avoid the ugly approximations using differential equations. To solve a complex trajectory problem you&#39;d just index into this manifold of possible solutions to find the one that works.<br>Then here&#39;s the kicker, would such a solution when taken even further to include changes in temperature and humidity over the entire flight of a projectile imply somehow math had predicted any and all flight paths before hand?

They did x and y separate, first finding a continuous curve/loop of antipodal points where x(p) - x(-p) = 0, then going around that to find at least one antipodal pair where y(p) - y(-p) = 0. Very Intermediate Value Theorem. I was trying to decide quick in my head if one proof had a more restrictive setup than the other, or if the proofs are equivalent.<br>One of my favorite Intermediate Value Theorem proofs is with the square table with uneven legs and/or an uneven floor. I blew away my coworkers in the break room with that one. It\u2019s even more fun because we have circular tables, with the legs in a square, so the balanced table isn\u2019t even out of orientation with the room. It\u2019s also true that a rectangular table can be rotated to be balanced, but the proof is harder and I don\u2019t know it. The IVT is my favorite theorem because it is obvious to most people, because we understand continuity instinctually from experiencing the physical world, even if most people can\u2019t describe it precisely.

I would think that a trip around the Earth (like the equator as shown) only ensures that any increases/decrease have to cancel out by the time you get back to the starting point (Kirchoff&#39;s law), but doesn&#39;t make a statement about the antipode of the starting point--you could decrease both temp and pressure all the way around until the very end but then quickly and continuously rise back up to the initial values.    My guess is that there must be SOME closed path that satisfies g(-p)=-g(p) since that was the theme, but maybe the equator was just conveniently chosen to satisfy but doesn&#39;t necessarily have to?
