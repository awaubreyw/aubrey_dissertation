Quaternions are often called the space of rotation, but it is worth mentionning that quaternions are more specifically the space of rotations up to two full turns. Why two? Quaternions are often used to represent the orientation of a 3D object, but an orientation represented by a quaternion is not unique: for example (0,0,0,1) and (0,0,0,-1) represent the same orientation yet these quaternions must be squared to come to that conclusion. The number two of full turns embedded in quaternions finds its origin in the history of their invention, and the arbitrary value of two full turns puts in question the practicality of the representation. Squaring quaternion reduce that arbitary number to a single full turn, and the simpler axis-angle representation defines a space where the number of turns can be infinite and is in fact the space used to interpolate quaternions. Despite the simpler representations, we will probably keep using quaternions for a very long time simply because we have invested too much in them already, and because the word quaternion sounds really cool, and because we lack imagination for naming squared-quaternions or axis-angle.", "comment_date": "2022-07-04T23:30:49Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Hecher", "comment_text": "At <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjMuIxRvygQ&amp;t=2m30s\">2:30</a>, that wasn&#39;t a GImbal lock, that was him styling for a header..", "comment_date": "2022-06-10T15:59:05Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Bowie mtl", "comment_text": "I swear to god I&#39;ve tried understanding quaternions 4 different times now I think. after watching this video for the 5th time IT JUST CLICKED! it makes so much sense, I was wondering if I really had to think in 4 dimensions but wow it can be thought of so much easier than that!", "comment_date": "2022-06-09T19:49:01Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "mark hughes", "comment_text": "Would a rule \u2018One axis only in rotation at any one time and two independently either projective or retractive\u2019 lines referred to the three internal polar axes of an octahedron get over the difficulties of \u2018the gimbal method\u2019 for defining points within a volume/sphere; (one \u2018compass\u2019 angle + the usual x and y co-ordinates)?", "comment_date": "2022-05-31T09:31:11Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "TheyNamedMePlayer", "comment_text": "Unity...

Today, I was going over them again (taking another shot at learning some graphics programming) and I had a startling realization that was not accessible to me the first time around. The process for utilizing quaternions to rotate a point/vector depicted in this video (q p q^-1)  is not only similar to rotations in linear algebra using linear transformations in matrix form, like R A R^-1 for a rotation matrix R (something I realized the first time) but the specific form of the acting quaternion q and its inverse q^-1 are eerily the same as the form of the rotation operator/transformation for the spin state of a quantum particle. In the video above, the rotation quaternion q takes the form of cos(t/2)+sin(t/2)*(x*i + y*j + z*k) where (x,y,z) is the unit vector describing the axis of rotation and &#39;t&#39; is the angle of rotation. The spin rotation operator is cos(t/2)*E - i*sin(t/2)*(x*sx + y*sy + z*sz) where (x,y,z) is the unit vector describing the axis of rotation,  &#39;t&#39; is the angle of rotation, E is the identity operator (in matrix form it is a diagonal matrix of 1&#39;s), and (sx,sy,sz) are the Pauli spin operators for the x,y and z directions respectively. <br><br>In fact, while writing this comment, I realized that the two things (quaternions and quantum spin mechanics) are, nearly algebraically identical. Just like the quaternions, the set of Pauli spin operators are anti commutative (i*j = -j*i, sx*sy = -sy*sx), the product of 2 components equals + or - the third (i*j=k, sx*sy=sz); the only significant difference I can find is when one element is multiplied by itself: i*i=j*j=k*k=-1, but sx*sx=sy*sy=sz*sz=E, not -E.<br><br><br>Basically, undergraduate quantum mechanics was apparently a prerequisite to quaternions for me.", "comment_date": "2020-07-29T22:02:59Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Martin Lym", "comment_text": "Hey, if anyone could clarify, after thinking super hard after the videos and the iteractive quaternions.
