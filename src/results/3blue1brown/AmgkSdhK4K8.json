For every point of a 2D loop, there are infinitely many deltoids inscribed into the loop which contain that point.<br>2. There is at least one inscribed rhomb for every point of the loop, so that the point is a vertex of the rhomb.<br>3. If one can show that by continously moving our arbitrary point around the loop, the rhombs undergo a continuous transformation, then there must exist an inscribed square.<br><br>Proof of 1:<br>For each point of the loop, there are at least two points the same distance d (less than the maximum distance) away from that point (can be shown by drawing a small enough circle). Then, draw a straight line from our first point, which is purpendicular to the line connecting the two points mentioned above. It has to pass through another point of the loop! The four points form a deltoid. The same method gives different deltoids for each distance d.<br><br>Non-rigorous proof of 2:<br>Start with an arbitrary point A. Then, consider points of the loop &quot;on the left&quot; of A and &quot;on the right&quot;. For every point B &quot;on the left&quot; there is a point C &quot;on the right&quot;, so that |AB|=|AC| (see Proof of 1). Let one of the points the furthest from A be &quot;o.t.l.&quot; and &quot;o.t.r.&quot; at the same time, so that it&#39;s the only point except A with this property; let&#39;s call it M (from &quot;middle&quot; or &quot;maximum&quot;). OK, here it gets a bit tricky.<br>Let d_l(B):=|AB|, d_r(C):=|AC|, where the domain of d_l is the set of points &quot;o.t.l.&quot; and dom(d_r) is analogous. By moving point B&#39; from A to M, we see that d_l(B&#39;) has its local minima (starting with |AA|=0) and maxima (ending with |AM|); same thing with d_r(C&#39;).<br>Now, let&#39;s move both B&#39; and C&#39; from A to M, keeping them on respective sides of the loop. Is it possible to do so while preserving d_l(B&#39;)=d_r(C&#39;)? Yes :) bc each time we hit a local maximum on one side, we can proceed further by going back on the other. Then, when we get to a local minimum on the side where there was a local maximum before, we again switch directions on the other side. We go further and further by kind-of-zigzagin, having d_l(B&#39;)=d_r(C&#39;), until we get from A to M &quot;o.t.l.&quot; and &quot;o.t.r.&quot;.<br>Why do we need this? It means we can continously change two, and in concequence three of the vertices of an inscribed deltoid with a &quot;constant&quot; vertex A. Now, let&#39;s focus on the segment B&#39;C&#39; - it moved from &quot;near A&quot; to &quot;far from A&quot;, which means it must have been the same distance from A and from the 4th vertex of the deltoid at least once; somewhere there we got an inscribed rhomb.<br><br>Proof of 3:<br>Imagine an inscribed rhomb ABDC, |AD|\u2264|BC|.

So what is a loop? A closed loop on a 2-D Cartesian plane can only contain certain parts especially if loops cross their own path. Straight lines, angels, and curves. So on a 2-D Cartesian plane any vertical line could be said the be the radius of an infinitely large circle. We know what makes a circle a circle is that all points are equally the same distance way from the center. So you pick 4 points equality away from each other to make a square in a circle. Since you can do this with one circle you can do  this with any circle no matter the size.<br>   No back to the other parts of the loop. If you have a vertical line you are already 1/4 of the way there to making a square no matter what you do with a the vertical line. If you make an angle with two lines you are 2/4 of the way to making a square no matter what you do.  Curves are just a small more visible slice of a circle which we know we can always inscribe a square in. <br> So here is the proof you really only have three kinds of loops if you can&#39;t cross over your own lines. A loop of all straight lines, A loop of all curves, or a loop that is a mix of straight lines and curves.<br>  Since we know when we make any angle with 2 lines it gets us to half of the square no matter what we do It stands to reason any loop that is all lines will always allow you to make a square. A loop that is all curves is just a distorted circle and even if you warp a circle it still maintains its properties of having 4 points equally away from each other even if  you can&#39;t see or graph those points. A mixed loop is just 2/4 of the square from any angle you can make and the other two can come from any set of curves.<br>  Heck It may be reasonable to say any loop on a 2-D Cartesian plane no matter how you draw it is just a really jumbled up circle and the circle still retains its properties of inscription even if it is warped to the point of not looking like a circle.", "comment_date": "2020-05-20T19:37:02Z", "likes_count": 2}, {"comment_by": "E D", "comment_text": "the loops shape looks like germany before ww2", "comment_date": "2020-05-18T10:20:36Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "CapitalistCrusader", "comment_text": "While taking linear algebra I found matrices uninspiring.

Thanks for your generosity of knowledge and clarity in sharing it. I\u2019m just beginning to grasp some of the rules the behind the beauty and the beauty in the rules of math in more depth, as an artist with a consistent string of math misdemeanours on my long-distant high school record, having avoided the felony of diplomatic failure by the skin of my teeth. Please pardon the ignorance in my probable misuse of forthcoming terms and tenuous grasp of concepts from math and physics. I\u2019m interested in whether, in your animation, if you were to stabilize the inscribed square at the centre of the dynamic diagram, so the closed loop moves around it, is it correct to think of the differential iterations of the loop as the possibility space or phase space of the inscribed square, and the shape of the surrounding scribble as its attractor, for that given loop topology? I\u2019ve been introduced to these concepts through digging into dynamical systems / chaotics a little, but understanding how an attractor is produced has eluded me until thinking about inverting your animation. I\u2019d love to see such an animation, as I think it will help visualize the inscribed square as a metastable continuity of form (subject to the variation in the structure of the loop) and an emergent (square) form of organized complexity amid the chaotic scribble of the loop. I also wonder if we were to take this approach of centring the square, and average over the shape of iterations for any given loop structure, would there be a homeomorphism across all averaged loops, creating a generic attractor for square-shaped metastability/metastable squareness (if this is a correct application of \u2018attractor\u2019)? A final question in the string: please can you advise what software you use to create and animate your diagrams and if you can recommend any basic, non-specialist versions with a gentle learning curve?

Perhaps because some of the operation like mapping the the curve to the unit square  which seems to lose topological features like self intersections or knots and introduces two point which are one, why not use half open intervals. Also the mobius strip which arises seems to an artifact of how we eliminated the order this operation does not seem a legitimate step in the proof. - i.e. when and how is one permitted to cut and splice a set created by an equivalence relation on some point. Finally it would be nice if there was some references to the proof in say a paper or a textbook where one could read the missing parts. Finally the film mentions another point - the intersection which we intuit taking place when juxtaposing the edge of the mobius strip. But there are strange maps e.g. continuously inverting a sphere in differential geometry so can we rely on intuition here ? What is the curve winds on itself - it might be a perfect fit for a mobius strip that should allow for a mapping to the edge of a Mobius strip.", "comment_date": "2020-01-04T17:38:23Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Ultra Sexy Chipotle", "comment_text": "I watch this videos as if I understand<br>Like i do<br>But I don&#39;t<br>But I do", "comment_date": "2019-12-30T00:58:13Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "mischief?", "comment_text": "don\u2019t care. didn\u2019t ask.", "comment_date": "2019-12-28T11:53:11Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "TheblackNight", "comment_text": "I love it", "comment_date": "2019-12-28T00:03:00Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "BoysOurRoy", "comment_text": "One day, a game designer thought, &quot;How can I implement topology into Mario Kart?&quot;", "comment_date": "2019-12-27T10:13:42Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Timothy Sheridan", "comment_text": "You might want to see how close that comes to the traveling salesman problem.

But two parts of a surface do not just cross at a point, rather their crossing describes a line, along which rectangles will center. Now I&#39;m not a topologist so I can&#39;t do a formal proof, but I think this line I mention would have the A and B points touching at one end (along with the C and D points touching, which is still a rectangle with only one dimension), and the B and C points touching, along with the A and D points touching at the other end. Now the definition of a square is the same as that of the rectangle, except AC and BD are perpendicular. With the center marked as O, we would say that the first end of this intersection line would have AOB at zero degrees, while the other end would have AOB at 180 degrees. Since this is continuous line then there must be at least one point on the line where AOB is 90 degrees, a square.", "comment_date": "2018-11-14T02:41:18Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "xrl80", "comment_text": "can we find a relation between the middle point of the rectangle and the middle distance between the base and the high point of the 3D object or its completely random the relation between them??", "comment_date": "2018-11-14T01:27:51Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Shobhit Maheshwari", "comment_text": "So if a circle has infinite inscribed  squares, then the 3d plot of the circle should intersect itself an infinite number of times.....shit.", "comment_date": "2018-11-13T11:33:12Z", "likes_count": 71}, {"comment_by": "Tamra Nebabu", "comment_text": "+3Blue1Brown In general, isn&#39;t the surface above the closed curve multivalued?

You can imagine taking a line, held at a particular angle, being moved through the curve. Where it intersects the curve, the line segments drawn between pairs of points correspond to individual points on the surface. Holding the line at that particular angle determines that those points on the surface have the same colour, even as you vary the position of the line through the curve. When the line just begins to meet the curve, a streak of that colour will move up the surface. These streaks will be continuous, and must always go back to the curve at another point. For a given angle, one can picture some streaks over the odd surface, all some particular colour.<br>Varying the angle slightly will vary the colour and position of those streaks continuously, except occasionally at the curve. Where streaks intersect correspond to either &#39;zeroes&#39; where many very different colours intersect, or lines on the surface where it intersects itself, which correspond to rectangles on the original curve.<br>To create a square, one needs a rectangle whose diagonals meet at pi/2 radians. This corresponds to points on curves of self-intersection on the &#39;coloured distance surface&#39; whose colours are pi/2 radians apart.<br><br>Depending on the nature of such intersection lines, different things must happen. An intersection of one point indicates a strange and lucky coincidence, and probably cannot be guaranteed to correspond to a square under simply definable circumstances.<br>An intersection of an open curve may include a point corresponding to a square if the difference between angles on the curve goes through pi/2, which can be determined concretely through certain combinations of values at the endpoints of the open curve. It may be possible to determine how these characteristics generally with the direction the colours change in.<br><br>An intersection of a closed curve, or possibly a curve which also intersects the original curve, indicates that we need to consider the direction the colours change in, along that intersection curve. If, for the different parts of the surface, the colours change in opposite directions, and if the colours go through the full range of colours and the &#39;winding number,&#39; similar to as in your 2D equation solving video, is non-zero for both those different parts of the surface on the intersection curve, then one of those points on that curve will correspond to a square, guaranteed. If this characteristic cannot be proven generally, then weaker solutions must be carefully crafted, and will probably be much more difficult to prove.<br><br>A good start to working with certain parts of this framework would be mapping these colours on the surface to the complex plain, and perhaps considering a function of z whose output angle corresponds to twice the output angle on the surface.<br>Remapping the colours back to the m\u00f6bius strip may, or may not, provide helpful insight, but this is terrifyingly difficult to visualize. A note about that coloured m\u00f6bius strip is that the edge will not, in most cases, be coloured simply, but must have a &#39;winding number&#39; the same as for the case of the circle.", "comment_date": "2018-04-09T07:07:05Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "tynil krust", "comment_text": "YES!

What if we used the same method of plotting distances and midpoints not to create one surface, but two? Knowing ? Say we have rectange ABCD. One surface for the distances of AC and BD, where it&#39;s intersections mark midpoints where the distances are equal. Since we know that the diagonals of a square are perpindicular, we just need to find instances where the A/C is equal to -D/B. If we plot a second surface, where the height is equal to (A/C)/(-D/B), we just need to prove that at least one point where that the height is equal to 1 will be colinear with the intersections of the first surface, parallel to the z axis. To put it simply, we need to prove that where the midpoints of two equal-length segments, there are points where the quotient of the negative reciprocals of the slopes of those same segments are equal to 1. Once we have those 3d points mapped, we just have to prove that the x and y values of those points are the same. In your opinion, would this get us any closer to a solution? I&#39;m inexperienced in topology, but i feel there may be a way to retain the slopes of ordered pairs while mapping them onto a surface the same way we map unordered pairs. Thoughts?

But upon further reflection, I find I&#39;m still confused a bit.  The central problem comes at the end, involving the mapping from a M\u00f6bius strip to the plane of the loop.  It is clear that the space of the M\u00f6bius strip must fold atop itself in order that the single (red) boundary map to the loop in the plane.  Thus there will be regions on the plane that have two points from the M\u00f6bius strip and thus two different line segments joining different points (a,b) and (c,d).  But I don&#39;t see why this mapping guarantees these two line segments must share the <b>same</b> mid-point, and (more importantly) the line segments be the ones yielding the <b>solution</b> (i.e., have the same length transepting the loop).  After all, the M\u00f6bius strip must be deformed and warped to fit within the loop and I see no guarantee this required deformation forces lines sharing the <b>same</b> mid-point to overlap.  There must be some implied fixed-point theorem invoked in this step, but I don&#39;t see it explained in the video.  Even if there were some fixed-point theorem invoked, such a theorem typically ensures that there is <b>one</b> fixed point.  But for the inscribed rectangle problem, the overlapping must be for the particular <b>solution</b> point.  I don&#39;t see how that is ensured either.<br><br>I may go look at the original Vaughan (1977) paper to answer these, but I wish I were just a bit more convinced by this lovely video, which is clearly the result of extensive and diligent work.", "comment_date": "2017-07-21T17:38:15Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Dali Metzker", "comment_text": "I wish I can give this video a thousand likes!!

Another idea would be to draw a cross sectional plane at the point of overlap on the folded mobeus and find 4 points whose arc length to the overlap would be equivalent, which might yield the result of finding 4 ordered pairs with equal magnitude and whose midpoints share a common distance to the midpoint of the rectangle, in essence proving that there is a square which can be drawn on that closed loop. <br><br>Another strategy would be to take the midpoints themselves and apply the same strategy as with the unordered pairs. Find the distance between them, their midpoint and project another line from that midpoint to create a second mobeus geometry related to unordered pairs of midpoints from the original set of unordered pairs of points on the closed loop. Now you&#39;d need to find a relation between 4 of these new midpoint and the overlapped midpoint represented on the original mobeus strip. Now what sort of shape this would form and whether there would be some recognizable pattern between these 4 points and the center is beyond my limited knowledge of topology. I think, though, if you could find 2 or 4 of these midpoint relationships which fall directly under the midpoint fold of the original mobeus strip, you may very well find a square there. Then if you could expand this pattern and find that it exists for all possible closed loop geometries, you may very well prove the existence of a square on every closed loop. <br><br>I&#39;m still a few years away from topology, so I&#39;m not sure how the magnitudes and distances of these points would relate to the mobeus after it is connected back to the edge of the closed loop, so it might all be nonsense. <br><br>What I would like to see, if you read this, is a short clip of the same process you did in this video for the rectangle applied to a closed loop with a known square. I&#39;d like to see the midpoints of the 4 edges of the square projected onto the geometry formed by the connected mobeus. Maybe apply that methodology to 2 or 3 different shapes to see if there is any discernable pattern existing on the original mobeus geometry, all related to the common midpoint represented by the fold.

The m\u00f6bius stip represents points that are a mid-point to any two points of your choice on the squiggly line, and the edge of the strip represents that line. The fact that you folded the plane and transformed it into a m\u00f6bius strip and not a torus means that you&#39;ve eliminated all excessive variations of any two points (meaning (a,b) and (b,a) is now the same thing, and therefore can&#39;t be used as two distinct lines). When you then map the strip onto the weird mountain shape and you still get intersections, it means that there are two distinct lines that have the same mid-point, and that they have the same length (if they had different lengths, then not only it wouldn&#39;t be a rectangle, but their mid-points mapped onto the 3D thing wouldn&#39;t share the same z coordinate, so there wouldn&#39;t be any intersection). Therefore, all intersections show a presence of a rectangle, and since mapping the edge of a m\u00f6bius strip onto a flat surface MUST lead to an intersection, it means that all squiggly lines contain a rectangle. Is that correct?<br><br>Also, to find a square, I guess you would have to verify whether lines (a,d) and (b,c) are the same as (a,b) and (c,d), meaning there would have to be a quadruple intersection in the 3D graph, since a square has a 4-fold symmetry.
