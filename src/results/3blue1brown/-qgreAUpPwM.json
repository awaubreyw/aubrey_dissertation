Starting very simple a circle or an ellipse or hyperbola can be plotted with almost no deviation.  But is is not just smooth changes in the slope of the curve that explain deviations because sharp points like in the Seattle skyline are plotted precisely as well as smooth curves.  The Fourier series has to plot the entire figure, so maybe if the rate of slope change--slope acceleration--is common within the figure there will be better precision in matching the desired curve.  But even areas with an unusual slope acceleration visually seem to plot with small deviations if the change in slope acceleration--slope jerk--is low.  So my best guess is that if the slope acceleration is unusual within the figure and the slope jerk is high, there will be an area of higher deviation from the desired curve.
