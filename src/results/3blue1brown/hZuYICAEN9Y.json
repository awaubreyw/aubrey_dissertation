A lot of really interesting things happens in 3D and 4D, possibly because low dimensionality constrains its properties. As a physicist, I&#39;m wondering if this is not a coincidence... No known law of nature, either empirical or following from a postulate underlying a consistent theory, requires the Universe to have blown up out of the Big Band with 4 spacetime dimensions, separable in the weak field limit into 3 space and 1 time dimension. In fact, GR equations are way too symmetric not to describe also a universe with 3D time and 1D space in the same weak limit.

Unlabelled graphs (also called networks) are nice simple ways of specifying a pattern of connectivity between individually indistinguishable things, for example &quot;10 things connected in a cycle&quot;.<br><br>Graphs can have disconnected regions, but then they look like separate graphs and describe multiple different systems of things, so lets make sure are graphs are &quot;connected&quot;.<br><br>Uniform polyhedra are interesting because they&#39;re (sort of) maximally symmetric, no corner is special, you can never communicate where you are on them other than to point because every corner looks the same.<br><br>Regular graphs exist but they can easily be very messy and non-symmetric, the equivalent in graph theory to the property that uniform polyhedra have seems to be vertex transitivity. These graphs include the skeletons of all the uniform polyhedra, but also many interesting grids that loop back on themselves, the skeletons of all the &quot;abstract polytopes&quot;, lots of discrete configuration spaces (uniform discrete systems?), and products of these things under various different kinds of multiplication. They&#39;re all a bit limited at small sizes because there aren&#39;t enough nodes in the graph to do much with, when the number of modes is prime, such as with 11 nodes, then it seems that all such graphs are circulant, however 12 is highly divisible and suddenly there are enough nodes for a vast plethora of possibilities, the well of possibilities here runs incredible deep.<br><br>Exploring discrete configuration spaces (small ones without too much connectivity) have also yielded some quite spooky results. Many of the ones I&#39;ve found look like uniform polyhedra with a couple of the faces missing, with a few small trees stuck on and a few huge cycles. It reminds me  of group theory, with all the nice infinite families of prime groups, and then the super-bizarre sporadic groups, it also reminds me of the surreals, with lots of nice, tidy, uniform order, and then a family of strange values such as whole families of transfinites and the &quot;it&#39;s zero but it&#39;s not equal to 0&quot; value that often get random goofy names, and come across as if they are put together at random.", "comment_date": "2022-06-09T16:00:21Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Stan Downer", "comment_text": "This is it everyone!
