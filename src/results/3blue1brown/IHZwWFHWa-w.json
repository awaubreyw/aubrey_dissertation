It is easy to think they are because the action potential itself is all or nothing. The professor who taught me always described it as flushing a toilet in that once it starts it can&#39;t stop. Because of that &quot;all or nothing&quot; aspect, they get described as binary, on/off signals. The issue though is single signals aren&#39;t how neurons transmit information. <br><br>The information transfer is actually a lot like artificial neural networks for most neurons. They fire at some rate within a range of rates which indicates a strength of something. Very similar to how artificial neurons hold some number between 0 and 1. Each neuron can fire very quickly or very slowly to indicate a range of values. <br><br>One clear example of how this affects you is with visual perception. Most of the receptors, as well as neurons in your cortex fire at some base rate which indicates no stimulation. If you stare at some color or a spinning wheel or really anything for a long time they will be firing at an increased rate and get fatigued. When you look away you will perceive an after image of the opposite colors or the opposite motion. What&#39;s really going on is those neurons are fatigued and no longer able to fire at the same rate or release the same levels of neurotransmitters as they normally do at the base rate. Your brain perceives this change as a &quot;negative&quot; of what you had been looking at making you see that illusion of the opposite colors or motion. <br><br>I&#39;m watching this video and all I&#39;ve been thinking is, yes it&#39;s super complex going by number of connections and values, but also it has made me realize just how elegant of a solution to these problems a brain really is.

That particular pattern detection isn&#39;t uniquely specified or constrained by this particular set of weights on the first layer; rather, there are infinitely many ways that the pattern detection scheme can be encoded in the weights of this single layer. <br><br>These infinite other solutions can be thought of as the set of matrices that are row-equivalent to the 16x700ish matrix where each row is the set of weights for each of the neurons on this layer. You can rewrite each of the rows as a linear combination of the set of current rows, while possibly still preserving the behavior of the whole NN by performing a related transformation to the weights of the next layer. In this way, you can rewrite the patterns of the first layer to try and find an arrangement that tells you something about the reasoning.

And neg. as opposed to the AI computational function of desparity of the intricate degrees of yes or no\u2019s (or basically including the strength and likelihood of predicting the gray area of maybe). Ergo, given this synopsis so far of being half way into the video I\u2019ve concluded that If you were to neurologically implant this algorithm in our brain it would be directed to the memory assortment and consolidation function of our brain= hippocampus! So when it is sorted it will be routed to the necessary areas in the brain needed to store such combined info to actually remember the memory itself. So instead of having simple binary function of 1s and 0\u2019s to distinguish between pos and neg. neuron activation we make use of this algorithm of fine tuning it so that there is more detail of the binary function we occupy so basically being in decimals within our 1s and 0s to help us better sort this sensory info in our hippocampus using protein and sending it to more better fit places that are more exact for remembrance!!!! This could potentially be the algorithm to solve the Alzheimer\u2019s Disease!!!!!!! Bc it would shorten the process of forgetfulness and given the billions of neurons we posses and also given some time to acclimate to this fine tuning we can make this a genetic pattern and have this algorithm imbedded in the coding of our DNA so that our later generations will be less susceptible to Alzheimer\u2019s Disease and shoot if we apply this same algorithm to other complexities of the brain we can solve motor function as well bc there will be less energy wasted to stimulate motor function bc the neurons will know exactly where to go in the most efficient manner.

How do we get around that?", "comment_date": "2019-03-02T10:36:29Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Travis", "comment_text": "Speaking as someone who has zero mathematical knowledge these videos are the clearest explanation of DL that I have found, amazing work!<br><br>I have a question that probably won&#39;t make much sense: Is the local minimum that is calculated the same for all of the digits being classified or does each digit have its own local minimum?

If so, would a programmed implementation just require a hardcoded check whether any node values are still changing? And if not, would the network be given a certain amount of time, be it measured in actual time or in a number of &#39;steps&#39; (a step here being information being passed along from node to node once), after which point the network is forced to send its information forward only to the next layer/to the output layer?<br><br>(*)  Not so much for what I think Wikipedia calls a finite impulse recurrent neural network, which only passes the information in a given layer forward in one direction (and so can also be represented in principle as a feedforward neural network, just possibly with very many hidden layers), but at least for an infinite impulse one, where nodes within a layer are connected in both directions so that you can get infinite loops of information, hence, I suppose, the name.", "comment_date": "2019-01-31T22:20:38Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "DamnStupidOldIdiot", "comment_text": "Wait, if you label the data differently, then would it not still learn at the same rate?

In principle - 255 spikes over 255 steps = 255/255 = 1, whereas 128 spikes over 255 steps = 0.5, etc. Its all about the activation frequency of the neuron.", "comment_date": "2018-04-21T18:55:16Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "gus bisbal", "comment_text": "&quot;Put yourself in the networks shoes here...&quot; great now I have to designs shoes for it too..... this is getting hard", "comment_date": "2018-04-21T00:51:08Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Kristoffer Jonasson", "comment_text": "Really cool video, as always. :) I have a question about the weights from the 784 input pixels to the first hidden layer of the 16 neurons..

First, is it even reasonable to expect single isolated features? Consider the case where you train on a set of faces; You don&#39;t get individual features like an eye or a nose or a mouth, you get a set of eigen-faces. So are the resulting patterns some form of eigenfunctions, an orthogonal set of features that do actually capture small features but in a more nuanced way? Second question: suppose you preloaded the first  weight matrix with the small features you hoped to get. When you do the multiplication of the input layer times these feature rows, the dot product is basically correlating the two vectors and should match the features if they are there. Given 784 weight rows, you can easily represent all the small features you want.

That&#39;s not true. Every synapse has several receptors (pores) into which chemicals signals plug. Two main chemicals that direct this function are serotonin and dopamine (there are others). Each chemical opens, closes, pauses (slows), or outright blocks messages. The transmitter has output pores, and the receptor has input pores. The transmitter sends the chemical signals through the pores, and receptor accepts those &quot;messages.&quot; There is a third mechanism that is often overlooked: it is the synaptic gap. It too functions to pass or impede messages. When the gap gets &quot;crowded&quot; with chemical messages, the chemical response between transmitter and receptor wanes: it gets &quot;tired.&quot; A common chemical, caffeine, plays a role here. It opens up the synaptic gap, allowing more or sustained messaging despite the &quot;crowdedness&quot; of the synaptic gap. That is why when the caffeine wears off, the subject often gets a headache. Back to the transmitter/receptor/gap interfacing.<br>The transmitters sends chemical messages; the gap accumulates messages; and the receptor collects the messages. The transmitter sends <b>different</b> chemicals, and the receptor has receptor pores for each chemical. (Psychiatry works directly with this operation.) The receptor does not <b>fire</b> really; instead is it more like a tipping cup: flow begins, accelerates, then ebbs. There is no binary on/off. In fact because there are different message receptors the operation is far more complex in that the neuron distributes its messages based on the cumulation of specific or combined incoming messages.

After watching this video twice, a little detail bugged me, and that is that &quot;random noise&quot; example you give, it popped out a lot of questions in me. And I want some &quot;expert on the subject&quot; to shine some light:<br><br>There&#39;s a TL;DR at the bottom!<br><br>In all the examples from which the NN learned, almost all of them had the outer layer&#39;s pixels set as 0.00, so that means that there are a lot of neurons that were 0 through the entire learning process. And how does this affect the network? well, correct me if i&#39;m wrong, but no matter what weight relates those neurons, <b>the output will still be zero</b> . And this means that those weights are irrelevant to the cost function, meaning that they were never adjusted. This is terrible for the learning process because the biggest weights could indeed be the most irrelevant, AND <b>totally random</b> (if the biggest weight was assigned at the start to one of those neurons, when they were randomly chosen, that weight will almost <b>never</b> change throughout the entire learning process). <br><br>Considering that, when you feed a &quot;random noise&quot; image to the network, which if you look closely <b>has an important activation on the outer layer</b> , the layer that was never actually adjusted, those values will by random chance, affect the result much more than the ones near the center, which were narrowed down in the learning process.<br><br>How do you fix this? well, I could have started by mentioning this, but: The NN never actually learnt what <b>isn&#39;t</b> a number.<br><br>So <b>TL;DR</b> here: This is the question that I can&#39;t get out of my mind, I believe you could fix this not even touching the network&#39;s structure, you just feed it a bunch of examples of &quot;random noise&quot; and set the desired output to nothing at all. This will affect the cost function much more if the network is certain about <b>any</b> output, and even more important: <b>the network will adjust every pixel of the input layer, and not only the ones near the center</b> .<br><br>My belief is if you add those learning examples, you could even force this primitive network to search for more reasonable patterns. And get one that can also classify something as &quot;not a number&quot;.

In such a case, the learning would definitely not result to be any different than if the 1:1 mapping was correct. The part of the video in question should bring out the fact (as intended in the concerned paper) that, after random shuffling of labels, the image class to label mapping was 1:Many i.e. two dog images can have labels &#39;cow&#39; and &#39;lion&#39; respectively and the network would still be able to achieve very good training accuracy, showing that it is failing to learn features general to dogs but memorizing the image to labels mapping (which does pose a very potent argument to re-think generalization)<br><br>Thanks for making these. :)", "comment_date": "2017-10-17T20:57:58Z", "likes_count": 4}, {"comment_by": "Fradin Etienne", "comment_text": "Something I don&#39;t really get is how the gradient is calculated.

What, as human, we like to think as neighborhood is just the set of neurons for which the activation shows a statistical correlation. It just happens that looking space related things (like an image), this correlation is seen between points close to one another, but rather than hardcoding this last fact (introducing our understanding of space by declaring that only neurons close to one another should be melt into the same pixel of the next layer), we can let the more general fact (the statistical correlation) drives this neiborhood selection process. The neural network could make itself convolutionnal, based on this self taught neighborhood &quot;consider only the neurons above a given threshold of correlation to the parent reference neuron of the previous layer&quot;.<br>Yes it wont necessarily perform better on our example, but it get rid of a supervised aspect, and the same system can adjust by itself to any kind of input (1D input,  2D input,  3D, ND inputs or even strange topology like hypertorus in 4D,) without any change because it deduces and build the topology of the data space based on statistical correlations from the input training data set", "comment_date": "2017-10-17T13:41:57Z", "likes_count": 25}, {"comment_by": "Richard Servello", "comment_text": "And large neural networks can start to form it&#39;s own training data and &quot;learn&quot; faster!", "comment_date": "2017-10-17T13:11:09Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "postvideo", "comment_text": "Try visualising the second or third layers.

It is true, that if a neuron &quot;fires&quot;, i.e. emits an action potential (AP), the amplitude of the electrical signal will always be the same (so basically no amplitude = 0, high amplitude = 1). However, by changing the frequency or firing rate of emitting these action potentials (basically the rate of emitting 1&#39;s and 0&#39;s), different stimulus intensities can be encoded (more frequent APs correspond to a higher intensity stimulus, less frequent APs correspond to a lower intensity stimulus). I would therefore argue that the &quot;activation&quot; of a biological neuron is also continuous and not necessarily binary.<br>Of course this has nothing to do with the content of the actual video, which is a really good (and intuitive) explanation on Gradient Descent (way more intuitive than when I learned that in university :D).", "comment_date": "2017-10-16T17:27:19Z", "likes_count": 18}, {"comment_by": "Lukas Eisele", "comment_text": "how does the program proceed when its stuck at a local minimum, that is not the global minimum or even close to it?", "comment_date": "2017-10-16T17:25:52Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "NotaWalrus", "comment_text": "But how do you actually compute that gradient?", "comment_date": "2017-10-16T17:24:03Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "nukedkaltak", "comment_text": "WOO BEEN WAITING FOR THIS", "comment_date": "2017-10-16T17:23:37Z", "likes_count": 53}, {"comment_by": "Anshul Gupta", "comment_text": "That XKCD comic is how a lot of people consider neural networks to work :P<br>Great video again, 3B1b!<br>Edit: Waiting eagerly for your ConvNets and LSTMs :D", "comment_date": "2017-10-16T17:19:54Z", "likes_count": 39}, {"comment_by": "petrolhead88", "comment_text": "F*** Siraj this is way better content than he has, I just love 3Blue1Brown.", "comment_date": "2017-10-16T17:19:42Z", "likes_count": 65}, {"comment_by": "Tarzan", "comment_text": "I was looking forward to this video all week.", "comment_date": "2017-10-16T17:19:14Z", "likes_count": 6}, {"comment_by": "Joilson Rabelo", "comment_text": "Please create some videos about generative models", "comment_date": "2017-10-16T17:18:50Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "kebien6020", "comment_text": "Notification appears. <i>Click</i> . 4 Views. <b>4 Likes</b> .
