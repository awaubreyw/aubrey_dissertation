The probability of having the sum of these 2 larger then 90\u00b0 is 1/2. \r<br>Maybe this can be related to Bertrand&#39;s paradox, since the distribution is different if you start with the circle and then chose a triangle inside it, compared to when you just define a triangle randomly and then state something about its circumcircle.\r<br>however as the result of my thinking the 3D case is way easier to progress. For any tetrahedron there exists a sphere on which all four vertices lie, I do not start from the circle, I only examine the surface triangles of the tetrahedron.

There is no way, that you can chose 3 dots, that can not be on the same half of the sphere. The only unknown factor is the 4th dot.<br>The tricky thing is, you dont know where to split the sphere until you have all 4 dots.<br>Just imagine having all 4 already and knowing where to split the sphere. Then you can split the sphere in half and you know for a fact, that on the surface of one of these two parts are at least 3 dots. You dont know where, and you dont know on which part, but you know they are there.<br>What you dont know, is where to find the 4th dot. But then you start thinking and realize, that it has to be on the other side, for the tetrahedron to include the midpoint. Then you think:<br>Ok, but where on the other side does it have to be, so the tetrahedron includes the midpoint?<br>Answer: It doesnt matter! It feels like it matters, but it doesnt, because you already split the sphere in the right place. The 4th dot either is or isnt on the same side as the others.<br><br>The tricky thing about this is, that it feels like you have to determine every one of these 4 dots, but only the positioning of one of them decides if the tetrahedron includes or excludes the midpoint.

A stupid scholar all overturned this truth and built it to a convenient system of Mason. Thus, the people believe the trickery of the devil than words of God. Darwin&#39;s evolutionary theory, the Copernican theory of Galileo, the theory of relativity, quantum mechanics, mathematics, the medicine of Einstein are all errors. A ghost, a UFO, supernatural power, the miracle of God to be said to be the occult are rather true. A thing and a ghost (God) exist in the world, and space is active by spiritual power (conception) of God. As for God, all things were created by the soul of language. It is clear if I read the Bible. Because the present scholar mixes the logic thoroughly in human wisdom, it cannot arrive at the truth. It is intuitive power to be important. Why does a child seem to be? The thing which cannot answer this is a mistake. Our common sense is more right than a stupid scholar. The creation of God comes loose only by a fate. Everything becomes the material by a conception of God (person).<br> <br>I cannot prove 1+1 = 2 in a numerical formula. I can prove only a physical phenomenon to say that it is in two apples when I match another one apple with one apple. It is not 0+1 \u2260 1. As 0 (nothing) is not quality, you must not handle it for a number. Because quality is different even if I match a mandarin orange with an apple, there is not a meaning of the addition. Because it does not exist other than God when I define God as existence, no (0) does not exist. Because the mathematics defines 0, negative number, imaginary number, \u221e which do not exist in the world, it is an error and is a fiction. A number is to count quality. When I am separated from a physical phenomenon, the mathematics does not have the significance of being.<br><br>\u203bIf 0 exists by a definition of the mathematics, 0 of the infinity must exist. However, the infinite space, infinity do not exist. In other words, because the mathematics defines 0, negative number, imaginary number, \u221e which do not exist, it is an error and is a fiction. Therefore it is an error because a zeta function, the numerical formula of the second oiler product deal with this infinity. That it becomes sum of series \u03a3 = 1+2+3+ ... = - 1/12 of the natural number, or the product of all prime numbers is 4\u03c0^2. It turns out that it is an error if I think for common sense. It is limited, and the mathematician seems to get a wrong this, but uses the sophism when I calculate this endlessly if right. This is a mistake of the definition of 0 or \u221e and is the evidence that mathematics gets a wrong. It is definition f&#39;(x) = limh of the differential calculus that must not divide it by 0 \u2192 0 {the same as it being 0 that says that I bring h close to 0 without a limit, and dividing it by a numerical formula of f(x+h)-f(x)}/h. I divide it by 0. The mathematics is trickery not study in this way.<br><br> All the origins of the scientific theory are random, and a bottom is broken. For example, in the theory of elementary particles, an electron joins atoms together and becomes the molecules. A thing joining a proton and a neutron together is a mesotron, and three quarks connect the proton, and there is it. An electron and a positron (antimatter) occur from a photon. An elementary particle to tie the elementary particle to whenever a new elementary particle is discovered is necessary and loses the relations with an elementary particle and the elementary particle more and more. Though a proton and the neutron are the same mass, why does a difference occur in having electric charge or not? The science has no answer with it in these questions. An electron is a material so that I think, and the positron is not a material in the hole of the material loss that the circumference was surrounded by in the soul children. In other words, the antimatter is an illusion. The scholar is going to examine it logically and loses sight of the truth. The structure of built nature of God is simpler, but is the thing which it is hard to understand in the human wisdom. A photon seems to have a particle and the two characteristics of the wave, but, in fact, the light has the property of the wave with the soul body.<br><br> Message from the spiritual world of Einstein <br> When oneself saw a scene of heaven through a tunnel of the light in the meantime, the person who experienced suspended animation well is you after the revival. The moving speed of the soul does not receive gravitational restraint anymore, and, as for the law of the speed of light immutability that I discovered during the lifetime, there are none in the world of the consciousness. In other words, I will say that it just moves to say that I think. Furthermore, it is just handed down to a partner to have thought. The life of all of us shares what one interiority. And the material is to say that it was actually consciousness. There are all things in your heart, and, also, you are existence to live in a heart of all life. When all of this space watches it with eyes, it is seen like the outside world, but is to say that the world to be actually seen outside is your interiority. The relativity disappears in here, and this space consists based on &quot;universal truth to certainly say to call God&quot;. <br><br> Near future to read from revelation and illuminati card of God of days, and to untie it in Japan<br> April, 2020 xx day The United States bombs North Korea.

I conquer the world in the life of the hell of the cruel survival of the fittest and am useless even if only oneself is going to be saved. Because a killed animal retaliates for a human being, cancer occurs. The meat which I ate becomes the blood, and a vindictive spirit dwells in a cell when blood does formation to a cell. A human being is cruel, and a fornication, a falsehood, committing theft, the habit of the evil deed of the luxury are not stopped. Eating meat is indirect killing. Why is God that existence of the evil is permitted? It lets you compensate for a human crime by the devil. A disaster, an epidemic, the war damage are the wrath of Heaven. Because a Japanese savior buys the crime of the world people, it is sacrificed. I fall in the trees and plants in spite of the pains then even if I writhe with a hell if it is just and changes the heart and does not straighten an act to measure up to hearts of God.

Our triangle will only contain the center, if the third point will go into a specific arc out of the four presented. The probability of the third point going into any of the four arcs is 1/4, therefore the probability of it going into the arc that we want is also 1/4. This number corresponds to the number of circular arcs we created with the two lines going through the center.<br><br>If we now take a look at the sphere we can apply similar logic by taking three random points and drawing lines between them and the center. This will create eight separate segments. The tetrahedron created by the three chosen points and the fourth point will contain the center of the sphere only if the fourth point is located within a specific segment of the eight we have. Quite similar to the circle, no? So the probability of our intended tetrahedron can be calculated in the same way \u2013 1/8.<br><br>Disclaimer: this probably can\u2019t be used as an actual solution, but it probably makes the problem much easier to visualise and document if you already know the answer.<br><br>P.S.

I didn&#39;t think I could keep similarly extending it, but if I halved it two more times for the other two dimensions, that would have given 1/8. Now I&#39;m wondering whether my method actually had merit or if it was just lucky.<br><br>So here&#39;s what I did. You can make a plane out of any three points, so I decided to assume that the fourth point is centered above this plane (that is to say that the line that passes through the fourth point and the center of the sphere is normal to the plane formed by the other three points). Imagine the fourth point as being at the top of the sphere. The plane containing the other three points (which form the opposite face of the tetrahedral) can only move up and down given the constraints I set earlier. There&#39;s a 50% chance that this plane ends up above the centerline of the sphere, which would cause the tetrahedron to not contain the center, and there&#39;s a 50% chance that this plane ends up below the centerline of the sphere, which would cause the tetrahedron to contain the center. From here, I said &quot;ok well since the tetrahedron could also be too far to the side or to the front/back, then I can say confidently that the odds that the tetrahedron contains the center is less than 1/2. Possibly 1/8 if we just multiply another half for each dimension.

You use this fact to replace the x in the base with e^lnx.  Then the problem becomes e^(x*lnx), and it is a simple chain rule that uses the product rule along the way.  The derivative of e^x is e^x, so the derivative of this problem will simply be x^x times the derivative of x*lnx according to the chain rule.  Then you use the product rule to find the derivative of x*lnx, which ends up being lnx +1.

The solution is 2^(-n) where n denotes the dimension of the ball. We can see this in both examples in the video. In the case of the disc, the probability is 2^-2 = 1/2^2 = 1/4.

I took that and moved on and found that the whether the third dot lands on one side or the other of this plane, it can be inverted without changing anything (before the fourth dot is placed). So, it would always land on one half of the sphere and where is the average point there? the center of that hemisphere. the fourth dot must land within the spherical triangle that the first 3 dots created which ultimately, if the second and third dots were at their average points, the fourth dot has a 1/8 chance to land on the other side. this means that, on average generically, the fourth dot will create a tetrahedron which contains the center 12.5% of the time.<br><br>also, the brilliant problem at the end.<br><br>suppose that we focus on one student and disregard who they are cheating off of. there is a 50% chance that just the person to their left is cheating off of their test and a 50% chance that just the person to their right is cheating off of their test. that means a 25% chance that both are cheating off their test, and a 25% chance that neither are cheating their test. this means that there is a 75% chance that any given person has someone else cheating off of their test. so, 1/4 people should be left without their test being cheated off of. also i did consider it, but the states of the people beside any student doesn&#39;t matter.", "comment_date": "2020-12-29T21:38:53Z", "likes_count": 320}, {"comment_by": "Mateus Silva", "comment_text": "Algu\u00e9m do Brasil?", "comment_date": "2020-12-29T17:30:38Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Deathwish", "comment_text": "We all know.<br><br><br><br><br>You did not watch the whole video:)", "comment_date": "2020-12-29T15:56:09Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "wats in ur freezer", "comment_text": "50percent Chance", "comment_date": "2020-12-29T07:39:19Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "TastyGoose48", "comment_text": "What the hell", "comment_date": "2020-12-29T05:47:04Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Akhilesh Dwivedi", "comment_text": "<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OkmNXy7er84&amp;t=8m55s\">8:55</a> acute angles will be the only possiblity", "comment_date": "2020-12-28T20:01:01Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Akhilesh Dwivedi", "comment_text": "The case I applied worked for octahedron but not for tetrahedron", "comment_date": "2020-12-28T19:52:21Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Arssam Basha", "comment_text": "<b>NICE!</b>", "comment_date": "2020-12-28T12:18:42Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "ferdi ko\u00e7ak", "comment_text": "Hi <br>\r<br>Which program do you prepare the animation with?", "comment_date": "2020-12-28T08:14:28Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Diego N", "comment_text": "This video is amazing just amazing.", "comment_date": "2020-12-28T05:14:12Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Tanya", "comment_text": "i aint able to get the intuition of how the average size of the arc is 1/4 when hes talking bout the circle :(", "comment_date": "2020-12-26T15:33:43Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Big Koi 101", "comment_text": "I Hate math <br><br>Also me:", "comment_date": "2020-12-25T10:38:03Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "luck yang", "comment_text": "why u call 3blue1brown", "comment_date": "2020-12-24T05:40:34Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Jorge Garcia", "comment_text": "Me in 8th grade not even knowing what a tetrahedron is \ud83d\ude02", "comment_date": "2020-12-24T05:32:42Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Alastair C", "comment_text": "I like how the median score of the test is just 1-2/120. <br>It&#39;s just so mathematician", "comment_date": "2020-12-23T14:41:16Z", "likes_count": 52}, {"comment_by": "boop", "comment_text": "<b>&quot;It&#39;s just a triangle, it couldnt be THAT har-&quot;</b>", "comment_date": "2020-12-23T14:33:40Z", "likes_count": 42}, {"comment_by": "vic", "comment_text": "I actually got the first question right wtf im impressed with myself", "comment_date": "2020-12-22T11:29:52Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Rojo", "comment_text": "It&#39;s just 1\u00f74 \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02", "comment_date": "2020-12-22T03:18:01Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "vDaBest", "comment_text": "3b1b should collab with DDOI.

Taking four points (if they don&#39;t contain the center) one of them is separated from the center by the plane formed by the other three, so if you zip it to the other side you are guaranteed to contain the center.", "comment_date": "2020-11-03T22:51:10Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "jill", "comment_text": "i dont know what ANY of this means, but its sounds math-y, and I like.", "comment_date": "2020-11-03T22:13:57Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "\u0417\u0435\u0440\u043a\u0430\u043b\u043e _", "comment_text": "Can anyone translate it into Russian?

And this video also shows something that can be applied in a much greater range of situations. A lot of problems may seem very, very difficult, and it may seem that the solution is going to take hours or days to come up with, but sometimes it&#39;s just a matter of thinking about it from a completely different angle. This in and of itself can be hard to do, but many of history&#39;s famous geniuses were merely people who were good at doing just this: changing their perspective. I imagine this is also why certain topics, like Calculus, can be hard to learn, as they were developed by somebody thinking outside the box, so unless a student can replicate that out-of-the-box thinking, they&#39;ll have a tremendous struggle.

As was shown in the video all that matters is whether or not P3 is in the cone. Hence, we can just forget about P3 and look at the different configurations of the cones. In fact as we can always just rotate our circle without changing anything so we can keep one of the lines vertical and spin only the second one. Next we can look at the surface area between the two lines (it helps to shade it) including both cones of the double cone the two lines generates. If we set the surface area of the circle to be 1 then the area delimited by the line is equal to the probability of being in that surface. Next we can use the fact that the probability of an event that is 0 or 1 is equal to the average of that event (think of heads or tails with heads being 1 and tails being 0). Spinning around the line the surface varies between 0 and 1 and thus on average the surface is 1/2. This means that if we stop spinning the line at any point and we randomly throw a point onto the inside of the circle the probability that it will be in the shaded area delimiting the two lines is 1/2. Finally as we are interested in the probability of only one sector of the double cone there is an extra coin toss to know which sector to take thus the probability 1/4.", "comment_date": "2020-10-19T14:13:13Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "hey wrandom", "comment_text": "The video was great as always. For me it was easier to understand the probability 1/4 for the triangle in the circle by replacing the circle with a set of N points along the circle and then take the limit of very large N. Given a point P1 the probability that the point P2 will be at some other point on the circle is 1/(N-1). Next the conditional probability given point P2 to obtain P3 is k/(N/2)=2k/N where k varies between 0 and N/2 because of the Pi and not 2Pi thing (N will be taken as always even so that N/2 is always an integer) . Then we just sum the probabilities which leads to 1/4 when N is taken infinitely <br>large.

And the same would go for the third and fourth point. Therefore in my head the probability of all 4 points being on just one sphere half and the tetrahedron not containing the center would be 0.5 * 0.5 * 0.5 = 0.125 which in turn would mean that the probability of it containing the center would be 1 - 0.125 = 0.875.<br><br>Same principle would apply to the simplified 2D example, and I would end up with 3/4 instead of 1/4.

Now if we tend to move the movable point to such a coordinate, where the form just enclaves the center and fixing the radius there and taking the center for the arc as the centroid of the three fix points. Now if we move the radius line on the sphere it will form a circle of particular area which comes out to be dependent on the positions of the other 3.

So much so that there is a correlation. So when we&#39;re taking in to consideration the amount of points and lines i assume as the dimensions get larger and more complex the amount of points required would too. Basically with n representing dimensions the points needed would be n+1. Simple. Not if every time we keep n amount of points fixated to lines and for both we have 2 options so basically 2^n options every time. Now if we take in to perspective that only one of these satisfy the probability then we have a formula for the probability. 1/2^n.<br>However does this stay that way in higher dimensions. Although in both 2 and 3 dimensional worlds we have only two options for the line to be does this correlate with other dimensions. so if we have a 4 dimensional sphere and we have 4 lines do these lines have only 2 possible correspondents. And if so how do other variables factor in. Also maybe in any of them do the options instead of being only 1 of the points working maybe in a another dimension more work. So basically could you make a formula for this type of question like 1/2^n or for n&gt;3 1/2^(n+1) because maybe every time we increase dimensions after three we get another possibility.

It looks, but it isn&#39;t. I didn&#39;t watch the entire video. Just the question part. But I know how it can, be done. Or to say, appropriately. The methodology, of solving this type of problems.<br><br>Let us try, with something simpler. I ask you more simple question. What is the probability, that a point; lies in a square. There are 4 different points, which form a square. Points are written in the form of Cartesian Co - ordinate system. So, what is the probability? The answer is simple. If both of the co-ordinates of the point. Are within the mathematical limits(in the form of real numbers) set by any (There will be 4 sets of points here. 4 sets. Each set defining the edge of the square) sets of points( sets of two points) , then it will lie in the area enclosed by the square. <br>Then we can calculate, by the typical probability method. The probability, that the point will lie. In the square, will be 0 or 1.  Though, that wouldn&#39;t be applicable here. Since the set is infinite here(the point could, be anywhere in the space). But what about an enclosed square , in a square? Then, it will be easy to calculate.<br><br>The same logic, goes for the given problem. Given problem, in the video. What if there were 5 points on that sphere? And then, we had been asked. To calculate, the probability. That wether the centre will lie, in that closed surface?<br><br>Do remember, people. One point. Is only a point. When two points, are joined. You get a line. When three points, are joined. You get a plane. When 4 points are joined. You get a closed surface, having a definite volume(and the same goes for 5,6,..... N points.).<br><br>I have described the methodology. Now, it is just a numbers game. For simplicity, take all of the points. In radial form, rather than the Cartesian form. All of the points, I mean.

Without loss of generality, we can consider any two vertices of the triangle formed by the geodesics to lie on the x-z plane, with the first one on z-axis. To calculate the surface integral, the most important part is choosing the limits through your visual imagination (\u03b8( measured from z-axis)\u2208[0,\u03c0] and \u03d5\u2208[0,\u03c0/2]). Having chosen the first three points, the probability of choosing the fourth such that the tetrahedron contains the center is (1\u2212cos\u03b8)\u03d5/4\u03c0. Now, EITHER you could say that since each value of this expression is equally likely given that the first three points are chosen as such, the answer is the average of its maximum and minimum value (You need the LIMITS) i.e. (0+1/4)/2=1/8 OR double integrate this and divide by an additional factor of (\u03c0\u00d7\u03c0/2) to normalize, and there you have it. Now that he told the former method in the video, I felt quite stupid for doing the latter earlier. I was like, Why am I summing equally spaced things to calculate the petty average :p<br>PS: Am I correct in thinking that the sides of the spherical triangle are geodesics because we are getting its vertices by drawing straight lines through the already chosen points (P1, P2, P3) and the CENTER of the sphere to meet the sphere if extended? Had any other point than the center were to be contained in the tetrahedron, we couldn&#39;t have joined those vertices by geodesics. The surface integral would have become a pain in the a*s but the &quot;line choosing approach&quot; would have yielded the same answer and saved our a*s.

So if the 4th point falls to the same side of any of them, you will be able to draw some great circle around the sphere keeping all points on the same side. So the tetrahedron only contains the centre if the 4th point falls on the opposite side of all 3 already constructed great circles, ie in the region directly opposite the triangle defined by the three points.<br>So the question reduces to, what is the fractional area of the sphere contained by a (spherical) triangle defined by 3 randomly chosen points.<br>Ok place the first point at the north pole, you can always do this. The triangle can be defined by the arc lengths of the two sides touching this vertex, and the angle between these lines, which is randomly distributed between 0 and pi. (if angle greater than pi, we actually want the area of the complimentary spherical triangle, so we can ignore)<br>So we want the sum, for every possible triangle, of the area of that triangle multiplied by its probability, or the expected value of the triangle area. If we restrict ourselves to triangles with a certain angle at one vertex, ie those made by cutting a wedge in two, clearly by a symmetry argument the expected value is one half times the angle over 2 pi. Since we should get a uniform distribution between 0 and pi, the expected value of the corner angle should be pi over two. Subbing this in we get an expected value for the fractional area of the triangle of one eighth, which should be the probability of finding the centre point inside the tetrahedron.<br><br><br>How did I do?<br><br><br>EDIT: Aaawwww fuck, I love being brilliant.

It kind of correlates to black holes, in regards to the fact that all of the information resides on the surface of the sphere. This must mean that a black hole is a simplex of infinite dimensions, thus generating a spacetime that has no relevance to ours because it is 90 degrees out of phase with our linear flow of time. Although the infinite probability of points will never cross the center point of the sphere, the points in themselves perfectly generate this hollow-sphere that is a black hole, which generates infinite space inside the hollow shell, and and thus a flow of infinite time perpendicular to our linear flow.

Think of a number line from negative infinity to infinity. For a number chosen at random there is an equal chance it is negative or positive. So half the time, the two numbers will be both negative or both positive, but the other half of the time, one is negative and the other positive.

First let&#39;s forget about the sphere constraint for the moment and consider uniformly distributed vertexes.<br>Notice that the volume of a n-simplex can be interpreted as the sum of &quot;volumes&quot; of n+1 simplexes, each constructed from the original one by replacing one vertex by the origin. If the resulting simplex is not fully contained within the original one, i.e. the origin is outside of the original simplex, the &quot;volume&quot; would be negative, vice versa. The &quot;volume&quot; of those simplex is given by the determinant of the position of the vertexes relative to the origin. Given n+1 vertexes and n+1 determinants we are sure that the determinants are fully independent of each other, and since each determinant has 50/50 chance of being positive or negative the chance of determinants all beibg positive or negative is 2^-n. Finally since moving vertexes radially couldn&#39;t make the origin to be within or outside of the simplex the additional constraint is actually irrelevant.

We could make a rough approximation by knowing the probability-distribution of points on the x-axis. To simplify things we can always orient the sphere such that one of the random points is always located at (0, 0, 0.5) above the x-y origin. (sketch a tetrahedron) We then rotate the sphere along the z-axis such that the point furthest from the origin is on the far left. We designate this as the second point, with our sphere and its four points oriented such that the first point is still at (0, 0, 0.5) and the line segment connecting the first and second point lies on the plane y=0, such that the second point&#39;s x-coordinate is the lowest possible value of x. Substituting the definition of x\u2081 being the leftmost point on the x-axis, we realize that the second point&#39;s x-coordinate equals x\u2081. Now to find the chance of the tetrahedron covering the sphere&#39;s centre! Because of our rotations we already know that x\u2081 &lt;= 0. Therefore the chance of the sphere&#39;s centre being covered equals the cubed probability that x\u2082 &gt;= 0. Since the spawn points of the third and fourth points are random, we know that their x-coordinates must also be random! We have defined x\u2081 &lt; x\u2082 and x\u2081 &lt;= 0, so if the statement x\u2082 &gt;= 0 is false then x\u2081 &lt;= x\u2082 &lt; 0. To continue, we would need to prove that lines converging on (0,0,0) in all three planes would form a tetrahedron covering (0,0,0). Because of our sphere&#39;s orientation this is greatly simplified!! We have oriented the sphere such that the first two points lie on the plane y=0, so we can calculate z-axis convergence and x-axis convergence through symmetry and leave all the burden of proof on the y-axis convergence. The chance of the third point having an x-coordinate greater than or equal to 0 is 50%. (With infinite possible values of -0.5 &lt;= x &lt;= 0.5, the chance of x = 0 is negligible.) The chance of the third or fourth random point having x &gt;= 0 is 50% plus 50% of the remainder, and 50% of 50% is 25%, so the chance is 50% + 25% = 75%. Remember that the first two points are on the plane y=0, therefore for the tetrahedron to converge at (0,0,0) we require that the third and fourth points have y-coordinates on opposite sides of the plane y=0, or that one of them has a y-coordinate equal to zero (in which case a face formed with it and the first two points will intersects (0,0,0)). Now that we have constrained the possible x-values of the third and fourth points, the y and z values may not have a random distribution, but for the sake of approximation let&#39;s assume they do, since sphere&#39;s are radially symmetrical, and leave the burden of proof to the z-axis analysis. Let&#39;s call the points a, b, c and d (from first to last). Looking at the y-coordinates of points three and four, let us designate them as y(c) and y(d). If y(c) &gt; 0 then we flip the sphere on the plane y=0, such that y(c) &lt;= 0. Our next constraint for convergence is that we require both y(c) &lt;= 0 and y(d) &gt;= 0, or either of them equal to zero (a negligible chance). Remember we are leaving the burden of proof for later. So the chance of y(c) &lt;= 0 is 100% because we flip the sphere on the y=0 plane if it isn&#39;t, and the chance of y(d) &gt;= 0 is 50% by symmetry! Now the burden of proof has caught up. Thus far we have managed to discard all cases where NONE of the tetrahedron intersects the y=0 plane at the origin due to the third and fourth points both being on one side of the plane and the first two points being at y=0. Therefore we have a lower bound for the chance of no convergence! Multiplying our possibility, we have a subset of 50% of 75% of all possibilities =37.5% chance that a and b are on plane y=0 and that c and d have y-coordinates on opposite sides of the plane y=0 such that for some values of z(c) and z(d) the tetrahedron intersects the origin. 100% - 37.5% = 62.5% therefore we KNOW from the orientation of our sphere that the chance of convergence being IMPOSSIBLE is AT LEAST 62.5% of the time, therefore when analyzing the z-coordinates in our remaining subset, we know that the upper bound for the possibility of the tetrahedron converging with the origin is 37.5%. Without knowing the probability-distribution of z-coordinates for points c and d, we know from orientation and the y=0 plane that the subset of possible values for convergence only includes 37.5% of all possibilities therefore the chance of convergence is 37.5% or less. That&#39;s about as far as I can reason. I do not know how to find the probability of z-coordinates spawning in our subset, or how to prove that the all z-coordinates from -0.5 to 0.5 have an equal chance of spawning for points c and d. Looking at our constraints, is it possible to re-orient the sphere without breaking our constraints? If we rotate our sphere and points around the x-axis then we break our constraints that a and b lie on y=0. But if we rotate around the y-axis then y(a) = 0 = y(b) holds true AND c and d remain on opposite sides of the plane y=0. EXCITING. Now we need to orient the sphere such that the tetrahedron intersects the origin... But we can only rotate on the y-axis which won&#39;t move the tetrahedron any closer to the origin. We started with point a at (0, 0, 0.5), so we know that one of the other points has to be at least 0.5 units down on the z-axis. The chance of that is around 50% plus 50% of the remainder plus 50% of that remainder since we have one chance for b, one for c, and one for d. So with even probability-distribution on the z-axis, there&#39;s about a 50% + 25% + 12.5% chance of one point being below the origin on the z-axis or 87.5% chance. (Otherwise the entire tetrahedron would be above the origin on the z-axis.) Then we&#39;d have to look to see whether it falls to either side..? But so far we know that our remaining subsets are 37.5% * 87.5% = 32.8125% of all possibilities. The chance of convergence is 32.8125% or less, and we need to know which tetrahedrons with c or d below origin on z-axis aren&#39;t convergent. Actually that&#39;s inexact because we know that point b only forms a line segment. Perhaps if we re-orient the sphere such that the z-axis is perpendicular to the line segment formed by points a and b, then we can designate z\u2081 as the z-coordinate of a and b but then x and y all transform. The point is that from triangles we know the origin to a and the origin to b is 0.5 (sphere&#39;s radius), so we could probably calculate the height of the line segment above the z=0 plane by looking at the coordinates of points a and b and then repeat everything over again from scratch to ensure that points c and d fall on opposite sides of the re-oriented x=0 plane, and we already know that our subset has them on opposite sides of the stationary y=0 plane after rotation about y-axis. We hope that if the re-oriented c and d fulfill this condition then we multiply with remaining subsets to get final chance of convergence. We don&#39;t need to calculate the height of a and b segment on re-oriented z-axis because c and d spawning above this segment would not form a tetrahedron passing through origin, whereas if c spawned above segment and d spawned below z=0 plane (flip sphere on y=0 plane such that that z(c) &gt;= z(d)) then the tetrahedron can pass through the origin (draw example) when c and d are on opposite sides of re-oriented x=0 plane.<br><br>Regardless of how we orient the sphere by rotating around the z-axis, the probability of two points spawning on opposite sides of a plane which passes through the origin is always going to be 50%, because the chance of one point spawning on the plane is negligible, and the other point as a 50% chance of either side. After re-orienting to get z(a) = z(b) = z\u2081 we want z(c) and z(d) to be low values. And a tetrahedron would probably need x(c) and x(d) on opposite sides of the new (post re-orientation) x=0 plane, and we need to calculate convergence on the y=0 plane. Choose d such that z(d) is the lowest point on the z-axis and call it z\u2082. We need a c that is low enough to pass the origin on the y=0 plane because a and b source from y=0 z&gt;0. (draw picture of shaded triangle under a shaded rectangle) The triangle must include the point (x,z)=(0,0) on the y=0 plane. Therefore we require that either z(c) &lt;= 0 or that z(c) &lt; |z(d)|. If z(c) not &lt;= 0 then z(c) and |z(d)| are random real numbers from 0 to 0.5 and the chance of z(c) &lt; |z(d)| = 50%. By radial symmetry the chance of z(c) &lt;= 0 is 50% so 50% + 50% of 50% is 75% chance that the triangle includes (x,z)=(0,0) is 75%. Lastly, we require that to look at x(c) and x(d) or on opposite sides of the newly transformed x=0 plane. Again as demonstrated twice, the chance of spawning on opposite sides of a plane running through the origin is 50%. Alternatively we could&#39;ve oriented to exchange the x and z axes and covered the (z,x)=(0,0) point, and the probabilities would be the same. Thus we have a subset of 32.8125%, with 50% of its possibilities being valid on the newly-oriented x-axis, and 75% of its possibilities being valid for the 2D rectangle+triangle formed by a,b,c,d on the y=0 projection.

First, notice that for the tetrahedron to avoid the circle&#39;s center, you need to have all 4 points within one hemisphere. If it is not possible to draw a great circle to define a half-sphere (aka hemisphere) that includes all 4 points, then the tetrahedron must include the circle&#39;s center. Let&#39;s call the points p1, p2, p3 and p4. If we can define a great circle passing through one of the points (call it p1) and one other point (either p2, p3 or p4) such that this great circle leaves the other two points in two opposite sides (i.e., opposite hemispheres defined by that great circle), then the tetrahedron will include the circle&#39;s center. Otherwise it won&#39;t. Because the points are positioned randomly, the chance that the 2 remaining points will be on opposite hemispheres is 1/2. There are 3 possible great circles, one passing through p1 and p2, another through p1 and p3, and another through p1 and p4.

So this is just conceptual and spatial reasoning.<br><br>But the way he explained the two dimensional triangle with the arc between the two points is how I visualized the problem first as well. The key here is that the average measure if that arc is 90 degrees. If you divide the circumference of a circle into 90 degree segments, you get 4 segments. If you divide a sphere into a bunch of perpendicular circumferences, you will end up with 8 sections. By similar logic used to explain the probability of the center point lying within the area of a two dimensional triangle, my guess would be that a sphere/tetrahedron relationship would be similar. And if that&#39;s the case, the answer would be 1/8.

Also I noted the word &quot;on&quot; (4 random points &#39;on&#39; the sphere). For the the center of the sphere to be encompassed  within the area of the tetrahedron, two of the four points have to have a distance between each other equivalent to the diameter of the sphere. Now I want to focus on the word &#39;contain&#39;. For the center of the sphere to be contained within the tetrahedron it cannot lie on the surface of the tetrahedron, but instead has to lie within the area. So, how do you say quantitatively that two of four points have to be equivalent to the diameter and that the other points have to be formed in such a way as to have the the center of the sphere lie inside of the tetrahedron instead of on the surface. Well, I now start to think of the other two points. Points A and B are the two points that have a distance between each other equivalent to the sphere&#39;s diameter and C and D are the points I will now discuss. I first think that &#39;well ok this is simple, the points C and D just have to have a distance between each other greater than that of the center point of the sphere&#39; and then I realize it gets complicated. I remember the word &#39;on&#39;. All of the points have to be on the sphere. So, the distance between the points C and D have to have a distance between each other greater than that of the center point of the sphere and also lie on the surface of the sphere. That doesn&#39;t simplify anything. I now start to think of points C and D in relation to points A and B. I then think one of each point (C and D) have to be higher and lower than the height of the points A and B. Ok so, point C is higher than point A and point D is lower than point A (**point A and point B are at the same height in this scenario, imagine a straight line being the diameter of the sphere, where each endpoint is A and B). This works so far, but because the four points are random you can&#39;t always guarantee that point C is the high one and point D is the low one- so to put things in a more widely applicable manner: For the center of the sphere to be contained in the tetrahedron 2/4 points have to have a distance equivalent to the diameter of the sphere and the other 2/4 points have to have a distance greater than diameter. Ok makes sense, but still not complete. So now we&#39;ve got two lines that stab through out sphere, one line with a distance equal to the diameter (with endpoints A and B) of the sphere and another line with a distance greater than the diameter (with endpoints C and D). Back to the question I posed earlier, how do you represent these statements in a quantitative manner? Position the sphere on a 3d graph in your head. Where the origin (where the x, y, and z axis meet) is the center of the sphere. Now plot the points. In this scenario points A and B lie on the x axis (points A and B can lie anywhere but in order to describe the relation of points C and D, points A and B will be permanent). Where can points C and D lie for the center of the circle to be encompassed by the tetrahedron?<br><br><br>Okay here I got lost for a while so I decided to watch the video and from the video I tried to make sense of the direction I was going. Great video by the way, really fun. <br><br><br> We know that the distance between them has to be greater than the diameter, but what does that mean for the positioning of the points. I&#39;ve just realized that I&#39;ve been wording this incorrectly. It is impossible for points C and D to have a distance greater than the diameter, what I mean to say is: the line between one point (out of points C and D) has to be greater than the distance between one endpoint and the center of the circle on the diameter line. Actually meaning that the line contained endpoints C and D has to be less than the diameter of A and B, but by how much until the center is not encompassed. Here comes the part about each point (of points C and D) having to be higher and lower than points A and B. For the center of the sphere to be encompassed the two lines have to intersect at an angle less than 90 degrees. So, line AB can be positioned on the going up and down, or going left to right. Line CD can be positioned going corner to corner. This divides the sphere into 8 equal sections (where line CD has two possible positions like this: / or like this: \\). This means that the center of the circle will be encompassed when line AB is equivalent to the diameter and line CD is positioned in such a way as to have each point higher and lower than the endpoints of line AB. So, when can this happen and when does it not happen- what is the probability of the points being positioned in such a way as specified above. Due to the sphere being divided into the 8 equal sections it means that on a 3d graph these conditions will result in an even chance. But because points C and D have to be higher and lower than points A and B- these conditions can only be met in 1/8 sections of the graph.", "comment_date": "2019-07-09T14:01:05Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "SG _15", "comment_text": "Is this some kind of joke youtube??...

The third point has to land inside of the reflected distance between the two original points. The arc length between the two original points as ratio of the circumference can be used to determine the probability. Translating this to 3D requires x and y components (spherical) on the circle and knowing the area of the arc between the three original points. With this area over the total area of the circle you can find the probability. Another possible way to translate to 3D is adding the other point to the calculations which causes an exponential decrease in probability over a 3D object: The 2D answer is directly related to the 3D answer. The variation lies in the variable&#39;s exponent in the formulas for circumference and area of a circle and sphere.

Start with a circle with radius r and origin O1. Draw a chord randomly at points P1 and P2. Draw lines  connecting the origin  O1 of the circle to these two points, extend these lines until they touch the circumference, mark the points on the circumference as P3 and P4 such that line (P1,P3) and (P2,P4) are both diameters. If a point M1 on the circumference is connected to chord (P1,P2), the triangel (P1, P2, M1) contains the origin IFF M1 lies on the arc (P3 ,P4). Therefore the total area occupied by such triangles is given by the sum of areas of :<br>triangle(O1,P1,P2), <br>triangle(O1,P1,P4), <br>triangle(O1,P2,P3), and <br>area subtended by the O1 origin and Arc (P3,P4)<br><br><br>If angle (P1, O1, P2)=\u03b8 (in degrees), then the total area of the region described above is given by [3*(r^2)*sin(\u03b8/2)*cos(\u03b8/2)]+\u03c0*(r^2)*\u03b8/360<br>To get the probability that my triangle (P1, P2, M1) will contain the centre I simply divide the above sum by the total area of the circle \u03c0*(r^2).<br>The Probability becomes: [(3/\u03c0)*sin(\u03b8/2)*cos(\u03b8/2)]+\u03b8/360<br><br><br>Its a function of \u03b8. <br><br><br>The choice of arc (P1,P2) subtends an angle with degrees \u03b8 at the origin.

Take the perspective of one of the points looking inward, into the sphere, facing the center.<br>2. The tetrahedron contains the center of the sphere iff the triangular face opposite the chosen point passes behind the center from that perspective.<br>3.

The probability of this is 1/2 the probability of a triangle passing through the diameter of the circle corresponding to the random radius, since it is symmetric and the probability of the random triangle passing through both radii of the diameter is 0 since the face of the triangle would have to be perfectly aligned with the diameter.<br>5.

So the probability of any single student not being cheated on is P(student to the left doesn&#39;t cheat on them) x P(student to the right doesn&#39;t cheat on them) = (.5)(.5) = .25. At this point we can treat each student as a Bernoulli trial where p = .25, and thus all 8 students as a binomial distribution where n = 8. Then the expected value of this binomial distribution is np = (8)(.25) = 2.<br><br>For those who don&#39;t know what a binomial distribution is, imagine 8 weighted coin flips, where each coin is biased to land heads with probability .75 and tails with probability .25.

A sphere is symmetrical, so the average is the median, which is half of a wedge slice!)<br><br>Then to get that average, I just integrated over all values for the vertical angles (\u03b82 and \u03b83) and the azimuthal angle (\u03c6). I also limited the azimuths to one hemisphere, arguing that angles greater than \u03c0 would just move the orange wedge symmetrically to the other hemisphere (EDIT: integration is not necessary! You can fix P2 to the prime meridian, and since hemispheres are symmetrical, the average \u03c6 is its median). Knowing that the vertical angles \u03b82 and \u03b83 are distributed as sin\u03b8, and weighting the integral appropriately, you get an average solid angle of \u03c0/2.

I wet back to the circle as well. The triangles contain the center if all angles of the triangle are smaller than 90\u00b0 (obviously). In the range from 0 to 180 degrees at one angle the probability of being under 90 is 0,5. But the three angle values are linked together, if we define two angles, the third is no longer variable. So we must take two angles that has to be under 90\u00b0 with a 0,5 probability, and that makes 0,5*0,5=0,25. At a tetrahedron you can do the same with the sides, leaving out one angle on the first side (first triangle) then leaving out two angles at the next one, as those are aready defined, then leaving out three. So you get the 0,25 from the first side, then 0,5 from the next one, 1 and 1 from the rest. That makes 0,25*0,5*1*1=0,125 which must be correct. :)", "comment_date": "2019-01-02T14:07:16Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Mohammad Faisal", "comment_text": "i love your approach...

These 2 points are theoretically infinite, but for each point of the tetrahedral you add it becomes exponentially more finite, 2^-1 makes it  .5 etc. Until 2^-3 makes it .125 My reasoning for the base being two, is that it represents one point of the tetrahedral, and the other the center of the circle.

Thank you.  It seems to me that you could bring it down a dimension further, too, which would be choosing 2 point on a line segment, and what is the probability that both points are on opposite sides of the central point of the line segment (or, specifically, that they are the same point, as we are talking about a 1 dimensional sphere, which is just 2 points on opposites sides of the centre).  This would be 1/2, as the coin-flip would only be done for one of the points.  So it seems that the probability will decrease by a factor of 2 for each dimension (or, at least, each point) added.  Hence, doing this on a hypersphere would result in a probability of the 5 points creating a hypertetrahedron (?) containing the centre at 1/16.

And if you would like to translate this to a 1d plane, the answer is \u221a(INFINITE), and in a 4d plane, the solution is (INFINITE)\u00b3.<br><br>Well, let&#39;s see what is the correct answer.<br><br>Note: Because i don&#39;t have the infinite symbol, i wrote the infinite symbol with letters and on a parenthesis.<br><br>Edit: Damn, i failed :&#39;v", "comment_date": "2018-09-26T00:22:14Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "poempedoempoex", "comment_text": "I have a physics test tomorrow... why am I watching this?", "comment_date": "2018-09-25T20:37:00Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "lol", "comment_text": "I guessed 25% i was right\u00d72", "comment_date": "2018-09-25T20:32:41Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "lol", "comment_text": "Head painy", "comment_date": "2018-09-25T20:30:07Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Trippin on the clouds", "comment_text": "this video helps me to sleep more early thanks<br>3blue1brown", "comment_date": "2018-09-25T17:56:20Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Gamzer Man", "comment_text": "<b>Class:</b><br>1+1=2<br>2-1=1<br><br><b>Test:</b><br>You have 5 red cars and 2 green lorrys.

I started with three dots that formed a plane just to one side of the center, and concluded that this configuration gave the fourth dot a 50/50 chance of including the center. From there, I noticed that, if you start with the center within the tetrahedron, the center stops being inside the tetrahedron at the point where any of the three connected surfaces passes through one of those planes. This states that for any one dot, there must exist a plane that divides that dot from the other three dots that forms a hemisphere. That gave a 50% probability per dot. At first, I thought that all four dots have to have this quality, thus making the probability 1/16, but then I realized that all possibilities could be transformed around a fixed dot, reducing the probability to 1/8th.

The question presented two polyhedra and asked how many faces would be on the result if you created a union by joining the face that was congruent on both polyhedra. The answer key had as the answer the sum of the faces of the two polyhedra minus the two faces that were joined. However, that was the wrong answer, because the choice of polyhedra used in the question resulted in faces on the outside of the union to be coplanar, and thus collapsing into a single face. A student who was scored wrong on this test challenged the result after receiving the score sheet. The result of the challenge was to admit the mistake and require the change of students&#39; scores.<br><br>This had me wondering how often this scenario happened on the SAT, where we don&#39;t get to see which answers we got wrong and so there being no opportunity for a challenge.

On a line graph from 0 to 3, if we choose 2 different whole number points at random, there&#39;s a 2/3 chance of getting a line passing through the middle at 1.5. It doesn&#39;t matter what the first point is. Moving up to 2D and 3 points, I thought, &quot;Are there any possible first two points that make it impossible for me to include the center with the third point?&quot; And the answer is no, because I can always pick the center as the 3rd point, and it will always be included. Therefore, I figured that for any dimension level D, and D points on the surface  of a shape(S), and for each point draw a line that passes through each point and the center, it creates the basis for another shape L(S), which includes all points on and between the lines made through the points and the center and the surface of the shape. If we separate L(S) into two parts, one C(L(S)) including from the surface and the original points up to but not including the center of (S), and the other F(L(S)) including the center and out to the other side of the surface, F(L(S)) Represents the space in which a D+1th point could be placed so that if a shape was drawn connecting all D+1 points, it would include the center of (S). I know that the location of each point in the first D points affects the Volume of F(L(S)) based on their distance between each other. However . . . I don&#39;t know how to calculate that.

The third point needs to be opposite of both points on those lines: so (1/2)*(1/2). next 3d: 4 points that&#39;s 3 lines and one point needing to be opposite the others on those 3 lines: (1/2)to the power of n....", "comment_date": "2018-02-01T19:51:57Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Chelonia Mydas", "comment_text": "lol 2^3", "comment_date": "2018-02-01T17:36:20Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Hanics Mih\u00e1ly", "comment_text": "If you think this is hard, look up the actual hardest Math Competition in the world, the Schweitzer Mikl\u00f3s competition from Hungary.

Remember that the center must be on the center of the line, meaning that your 2 points must be able to get double the distance between eachother as the distance from either one to the centerpoint. Now imagine going down another dimension. This leaves you with 0 dimensions and 1 dot to place.<br>The 0 dimensional &#39;object&#39; has a 1 on 1 chance of the dot being on the centerpoint.<br>if you take the 1 dimensional object (the line) and lock one point as far away from the centerpoint as possible, you&#39;ll see that the other point has a 50% chance of intersecting the center.

For any such plane the remaining 2 points have to be on opposite sides of the plane for the tetrahedron to include the sphere&#39;s center. <br>While there are 6 such plains for a tetrahedron (4 points), the 4th point is constrained by the remaining 3 and we don&#39;t have to worry about these plains. This leaves 3 plains to worry about.<br><br>In the 2D example this reduces to lines through 1 point and the center and then it pretty much follows your video. Again, the 3d point is constrained by the first 2, so we only have to worry about 2 lines:<br>Pick 2 random points P1, P2 on a circle. Combined with the center M , they construct two lines A = [P1, M], B = [P2, M], each cutting the circle in half. Line A only requires P1 and M meaning that P2 is &quot;left over&quot; and lies on one of the half circles. The (constrained) point P3 has to lie on the opposite side of P2 to include the center. As P3 is chosen randomly there is a 0.5 = 50% chance of this happening. Similar for line B, P3 has to be on the opposite half-circle of P1. Further, this happening for line A or line B is independent of each other, thus the total probability is: P(center included) = 0.5 * 0.5 = 0.25 = 1/4<br><br>For the Sphere it is similar: Choose 3 points P1, P2, P3 arbitrarily on the sphere. Combined with the center point M we can construct 3 plains that divide the sphere in half A = [P1, M, P2], B=[P1, M, P3] and C = [P2, M , P3]. For each such plain we are left with 1 (unused) point that lies on one of those halfs (with probability 0.5) and we want P4 to be on the opposite side, so that the plain separates the two. What is the probability of this happening, if the 4th point is chosen at random on the entire sphere?

I found this by turning the students into corners of regular shapes then checked it using shapes with less corners, starting with a square. Using bit of educated guessing I decided that the highest number of people that could go un-copied(starting to wonder if that&#39;s a word) would happen if everyone, instead of looking randomly, looked to the person closest to a single point, by using shapes the point would be a corner and the person at that corner would copy the person next to them, then the maximum amount of people that could possibly go uncopied would be grouped on the opposite corner due to everyone looking away from them. After doing the same test with a few regular shapes I discovered that the maximum amount of people that could go unnoticed (&quot;uncopied&quot; was bothering me) would always be 2 (apart from the triangle and semi-circle). Finally I made it to the octagon. Just to be sure I did the test and as I expected the amount that went unseen (ok, &quot;unseen&quot; feels right) was 2. A few seconds of thinking and I realised this could be done roughly 8 times on an octagon, few more seconds of thinking and I realised getting one person to go unseen was impossible, and my final few seconds of thinking were spent finding the total amount of times you could get everyone copied, turns out it was 3, 1 if everyone&#39;s vision goes in a circle, another if the circle is reversed and the last one is when you split it into pairs and then the partners copy each other. A few nanoseconds of thinking and I found that the probability was out of 11. 8&gt;2 so the probability of 2 unseen students, which was 8/11 meant it was most likely.

So I will attempt to walk you through my 3 dimensional analysis of the problem. <br><br>4 points on a tetrahedron which all have to touch the surface of the sphere. We know that only one of the points has to lay on the opposite side of the sphere to pass through the center however there is also a large probability that that point will not pass through the center. 1 point out of 4 is 25% but we know that there are many points that are in that probability that will not pass through the center. So I cut the circle in quarters knowing that each one of those 4 pieces contains the center of the sphere. Meanwhile we have to take our 25% and divide that by 4 to account. Giving me 6.25% probability. However this piece still contains areas that could form a tetrahedron that still would not cross the center. For that I take the surface area of 1/4 of a sphere. we know the surface area of a sphere is 4pi*r^2 so 1/4th of that is just pi*r^2. <br><br>So I would recon 6.25% of pi*r^2 would get me through center. Since the radius is always included in the part of the sphere that the tetrahedron passes through you can substitute 6.25% for the radius.<br><br>So that would effectively be 3.14x0.00625^2 which is equal to 0.000122 or 0.122% A very small number, which I figured it would be less than 1% considering the infinite amount of points on the surface of a sphere to choose from. let alone ones that pass through center. <br><br>Again I have no idea if this is correct, I just figured I&#39;d try to to quick maths with the old noggin. 2+2 is 4 -1 thats 3 quick maths.", "comment_date": "2017-12-17T00:42:19Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "carlo orioli", "comment_text": "This track is straight fire", "comment_date": "2017-12-17T00:30:17Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "VALRINA", "comment_text": "The fun thing is that if you already have the answer for the circle , you can just square it.", "comment_date": "2017-12-17T00:20:46Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Daniel Wilkowski", "comment_text": "<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OkmNXy7er84&amp;t=8m23s\">8:23</a> &quot;so one and only one&quot; - where did you get that assumption?

Because the 1-D case is that the 1-D sphere (S^1) is a segment on the number line [-1, 1], and the &quot;triangle&quot; is just a sub-segment. Then it&#39;s obvious that the probability of a randomly chosen sub-segment is 1/2 (the probability it contains 0, the center).<br><br>Then I thought about random planes, sheets of paper tossed &quot;randomly&quot; onto a circle and having a 1/2 probability of including the center, but couldn&#39;t really get much farther than that since each random plane has to align in a certain way to the previous planes that were tossed.<br><br>I then fast forwarded to the answer and was triggered by the fact that it was 1/8 = (1/2)^3. Not really sure where I&#39;m going with this, but the 3D case could be thought of as, the first 3 points determine a random triangle (a plane), and if we pick the points so that we get a consistent result for the half-space associated with the 3 points and the plane, there&#39;s 1/2 chance that it contains the center (reduction to the 1-D) case.

Thus, you realize 1 over 2 to the first power (1/2) solves the first dimension problem, 1 over 2 squared (1/4) solves the second dimension problem, and therefore (assuming you&#39;re running low on time on this test), you can reasonably infer, rather than prove, that 1 over 2 cubed (1/8), solves the original spherical problem using visuals a junior high student could comprehend. <br><br>And...<br><br>If you really wanted to feel confident in this conjecture, you could also look at a 0 dimensional singular point which of course has a 100% probability of a random point intersecting it&#39;s &quot;center&quot;.

For any student (so pick one and call him &#39;A&#39;) there are two students that might cheat off of them, each one has a 50% chance of not choosing &#39;A&#39; to cheat off of. So there&#39;s a 25% chance that neither will choose &#39;A,&#39; and with 8 students we expect to see .25 * 8 = 2 students on average who have nobody cheating off of them. But this is a trivial problem, let&#39;s make it more interesting. <br><br>Obviously any student who leans over to cheat off of another student would be put off if THEY were cheating off of HIM, so let&#39;s assume that no pair of students can use each other for answers. To arrive at a unique configuration we&#39;ll do this in 2 rounds. In round 1 each student randomly selects one student to copy off of. Then we pick a student at random and label them &#39;A&#39; and &#39;B&#39; and &#39;C&#39; and so on, going counterclockwise until we run out of students. <br><br>Round 2 starts with &#39;A,&#39; who examines his cheatee to make sure they aren&#39;t cheating off of him. If they are, then &#39;A&#39; attempts to switch to the other person. If they are ALSO cheating off of &#39;A,&#39; then &#39;A&#39; gives up and decides not to cheat. Then we move on to &#39;B,&#39; who applies the same rules. once we&#39;re done no two students should be cheating off of each other, but some may not have anyone cheating off of them, and some may not be cheating at all.<br><br>So what is the expected value for each group?

All triangles that do NOT contain the center have all their points within a semicircle (2D) or a hemisphere (3D). This is pretty clear in the 2D case, wherein you can always draw a diameter that divides the circle into one half that contains the triangle and one half that does not, in cases where the center of the circle is not within the triangle (this is actually a fairly obvious observation).<br><br>So then the problem becomes: What is the probability that three random points on a circle can be contained a semicircle, and so on for higher dimensions. Sadly, this is where it gets a little more complicated. If anyone has a nicer way of doing this, feel free.<br><br>For the 2D case, the first 2 points will always be in the same semicircle as one another (edge cases aside), so those are placed randomly and independently. Let&#39;s call these 2 points A and B, and they are on the top of the circle A being left of B (this is for orientation purposes only). Point C: in order for all three points to be in the same semicircle, Point C can be in a semicircle that has it&#39;s rightmost edge at B at one extreme (called &quot;B semicircle&quot;) or it&#39;s leftmost edge at A at the other extreme (called &quot;A semicircle&quot;). If C is outside both of these semicircles, then all three points will NOT be in the same semicircle. The probability of C being in either A semicircle or B semicircle is 1/2, and if we just add them up we get 1. However, these 2 semicircles do overlap, so we need to remove that. Since A and B were picked  independent of one another, the overlapping area in the average case will be 1/2 x 1/2 = 1/4. So the chance that all three points can be contained in any semicircle is 1 - 1/4 = 3/4, and the converse is 1 - 3/4 = 1/4.<br><br>For the 3D case, there&#39;s a slightly easier way of counting the probabilities. Instead of just adding up all the probabilities for each new &quot;hemisphere&quot;, we only add the components that are non-overlapping. So the hemisphere for point A adds a 1/2 to the probability that all 4 points are in the same hemisphere, but the hemisphere for B only adds 1/4 (since half of this hemisphere is already contained inside the &quot;A&quot; hemisphere). And the one for C adds 1/8 only. Doing the same process, we get 1/8 as the probability that not all 4 points can be contained in the same hemisphere.<br><br>The initial intuition works very well for me on this solution, but the math clearly is a little more complicated.", "comment_date": "2017-12-10T16:53:24Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Pi", "comment_text": "Would the probability be 1/16 when using 5 dots on a 4d-sphere?", "comment_date": "2017-12-10T16:42:43Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Andrew Wang", "comment_text": "Brilliant is the best!", "comment_date": "2017-12-10T15:26:01Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Waltz Ng", "comment_text": "Very good video!", "comment_date": "2017-12-10T15:19:13Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Peetiegonzalez", "comment_text": "The weirdest thing is once you lay out the conceptualization, the result is obvious.

Should have just taken YouTube video tutorials from Mexico since that&#39;s how I ended up learning everything since my professors were mostly useless. <br><br>Seeing things like this makes me think perhaps the undergraduate studies in the US are just plain terrible - not because this problem is &quot;simple&quot;, but it shouldn&#39;t be a problem for &quot;geniuses&quot;. <br><br>I can really guarantee this is something I could have well been asked to solve in a regular 1st to 2nd semester class in Mathematics in Mexico - it might have ended up as the problem who fucked almost every student in the class - but it certainly wouldn&#39;t have been a problem reserved to the &quot;elite&quot; of our college. <br><br><br>Why is this all relevant?

The sphere can be rotated such that the plane these three first points lie in is line with the viewing plane, such that the triangle appears as a two dimensional line and the sphere appears as a circle, see: <a href=\"https://imgur.com/a/VQxPe\">https://imgur.com/a/VQxPe</a> . Considering the line p1p2 can span from an infinitesimal point at the base, to the diameter of the circle, where the likelihood of a point above the diameter creating a triangle spans from zero to one (bearing in mind that if p2 moved up the circle, for example, the circle would rotate such that p1p2 is once again parallel with the bottom of the image), I intuitively believed that the probability of a point in the upper half of the circle forming a triangle would also be one in two, given that this point is in the upper half to begin with. This gave me the same result as in the video for a 1 in 4 chance of the triangle in a circle containing the midpoint, though without any reasoning other than aforementioned intuition. It was then just through intuitive extrapolation that the odds of the third dimensional aspect also being viable in this instance would also be one in two, yielding a probability of 0.125<br><br>I should stress that none of this is meant to be a rigorous proof, this was just my first intuitions which I would attempt to build into a proof were I actually taking this test, and I was incredibly surprised to find that my answer was correct, despite spending over an hour visualising spheres and trying to think of whether the jumps I was making would be valid, especially as I&#39;ve already identified a couple of problems with what I did.<br><br>I must confess I hadn&#39;t heard of this test before this video, but I&#39;m pleased I was able to fumble my way through to an answer, which I probably wouldn&#39;t score very highly for, yet am still somewhat proud of.", "comment_date": "2017-12-08T20:05:07Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Sighmaniac RotMG", "comment_text": "A friend and I solved this problem as a research project this summer.

This revelation can be obtained ofcourse in two ways, the dimensional upgrade of the 2d realisation of the same fact (all three points must lie on the same semicircle) or the 3d way. That is assuming an arbitrary plane A (whose points of intersection  with the plane assumed to be a locus of 3 random points) that passes through the sphere, preferably not through the centre (coz if it did the all possibilities of the third point will contain the centre) and a plane O parallel to said plane passing through the centre. It is easy to notice that all the points on the same side of plane O as plane A, do NOT contain the centre. Now you might argue that there are points on the other side of plane O which still have the centre outside the tetrahedron(or cone since we considered the locus of all points though the plane), but that simply means you&#39;ve found another another planeB passing through the new point and some other new points, which is CLOSER to a parallel plane passing through the centre than plane A was.

Each of those 2 students chooses that predefined direction with 50% chance. So, each student has 50%^2 = 25% chance that nobody is reading off of their test. As there are no edges (students that only have 1 neighbour), there are no special cases to consider.<br>o) There are 8 students in total. 8*0.25 = 2. On average, we&#39;d expect 2 students that have nobody reading off of them.<br><br>Bonus:<br>o) The minimum is 0 students (e.g. all students look in the same direction, or alternating left-right looking i.e. making them cheat in pairs)<br>o) The maximum number of students should be 4.  <b>R</b> &gt; R &lt;&gt; L &lt; <b>L</b>  <b>R</b> &gt; R &lt;&gt; L &lt; <b>L</b> (L and R indicate the looking direction, &gt; and &lt; are the arrows showing in which direction the student looks, the letters/ students in bold are the ones who&#39;s test nobody is looking at) We are looking for a L  <b>X</b>  R pattern (where X means the direction does not matter) and each student can either be the L or the R in that pattern. Thus, each L <b>X</b> R pattern can&#39;t overlap with translations of the same pattern. Each pattern we place on the circle defines the looking-direction of 2 students. Thus, we can place a maximum of 8 (students) divided by 2 (students per pattern) = 4 patterns. Each placed pattern leads to one student who fits the criteria. So, a maximum of 4 placed patterns means that we can have a maximum of 4 students whose test is not cheated off of. There is at least one possibility to place those 4 patterns (shown above), thus it is possible to have 4 students who are not cheated off of, but not more.<br><br>Edited for formatting problems", "comment_date": "2017-12-08T18:45:41Z", "likes_count": 11}, {"comment_by": "Sachin Shukla", "comment_text": "<b>3b1b notification comes in ...</b><br> &quot;Today is a good day&quot;", "comment_date": "2017-12-08T18:39:30Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "xenontesla122", "comment_text": "I got the right answer, but through the wrong reasoning.
