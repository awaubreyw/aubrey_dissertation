The amount of this bend depends on the ratio of the speed of light in water (slower) compared to air (faster).  The amount that light is slowed down by any media is called the index of refraction, n.  For example: vacuum = 1, air = 1.0+, water = 1.33, glass = 1.5, diamond = 2.42.  Sounds pretty generic, right?  Just a simple number.  Not so fast!    Because of the imaginary terms in the quantum mechanical equation of a light wave, if you add a complex component to the index of refraction, it will act as an attenuation (absorbing) of the light in the medium.

When your money is real and positive, you can withdraw it and the bank cannot use it.  When your money is imaginary and positive, you can borrow against it (and pay interest to yourself).  When your money is real and negative, you have to pay back any borrowed imaginary funds and increase your real principle (that is, save more!).   When your money is imaginary and negative, the bank can borrow against your account and will pay you back in the same manner as you just paid yourself previously.  Finally, when the cycle is over you can withdraw your principle or let it continue on another cycle.

Let&#39;s represent 2x2 matrices as [a b; c d], where [a b] is the 1st row &amp; [c d] the 2nd. Also, represent the conjugate of z as z*.<br><br>First, complex arithmetic is equivalent to that of 2x2 matrices of the form [a -b; b* a*] for real numbers a &amp; b. (Here the *s are vacuous, but harmless.) Each such matrix can be decomposed as a\u2022I + b\u2022K, where I is the 2x2 identity matrix &amp; K = [0 -1; 1 0]. Note that K\u00b2 = -1\u2022I, and that K as a linear transformation is a 90\u00b0 rotation in R\u00b2. (Thus we could have obtained the complex numbers as the algebra of scaled rotations in the plane, if only linear algebra had been developed before the theory of polynomials; nothing &quot;imaginary&quot; about it.)<br><br>Next, define complex numbers z = x+iy &amp; w = u+iv, and create the matrix Q = [z -w; w* z*], by analogy with the previous matrix. Then Q = [x+iy -u-iv; u-iv x-iy], and can be decomposed as Q = x\u2022I + y\u2022J + u\u2022K + v\u2022L, where I &amp; K are as before, J = [i 0; 0 -i] &amp; L = [0 -i; -i 0]. Now we have matrix products J\u00b2 = K\u00b2 = L\u00b2 = JKL = -1\u2022I, which are the defining equations of the quaternions expressed in complex 2x2 matrix form.

Since the x^3 terms arise from picking x/n for any three of the terms in the expansion and 1 for all the others, we get n choose 3 copies of x^3/n^3. Adding those together, the term is nC3*x^3/n^3, meaning the coefficient is nC3/n^3.<br>Now by the formula for nC3, we have nC3/n^3 = n! / (3! * (n-3)!) /n^3.<br>n!/(n-3)! is the same as n(n-1)(n-2), so it&#39;s a cubic polynomial. This means that we get:<br>(n^3 - 3n^2 + 2n) / n^3 * (1/3!)<br>For large values of n, all of the lower degree terms in the polynomial become negligible, and (n^3 - 3n^2 + 2n) / n^3 converges to n^3/n^3 = 1. So all that&#39;s left is the 1/3!, which is the coefficient of x^3 in the infinite series.<br>All of the same reasoning goes for the coefficient of x^k. The ratio n!/(n-k)! ends up simplifying to a polynomial with leading term n^k and a bunch of negligible lower terms. As n gets very large, this will cancel with the n^k term on the bottom, leaving us with a coefficient of 1/k!.", "comment_date": "2020-05-02T06:17:37Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Georgios Varvoutis", "comment_text": "I am curious.

This has the interpretation that we start at 1 at x=0, and earn a very small interest of 100h% in each successive time interval of h seconds, for x seconds. Hence, computing exp(x+y) is just like multiplying 1 by (1+h), approximately (x+y)/h times, which should be approximately the same as multiplying 1 by (1+h) x/h times and then multiplying the result by (1+h) y/h times (This suggests that exp(x+y)=exp(x)exp(y)). As h tends to zero, the approximations should turn to equalities (I guess?). To compute exp(ix), we multiply 1 by (1+ih), approximately x/h times. (1+ih) corresponds to an angle of arctan(h) which is approximately &#39;h&#39; for radian &#39;h&#39;.

What I saw you\u2019d want the square root if you halved the interval, and the 12th root if it was 12 times as often.  It annoyed me that they were shoving this linear reasoning peg into an exponential-shaped hole. And then that forces you into talking about getting interest \u201ccontinuously,\u201d which doesn\u2019t make sense in this context. I definitely get interest in my bank account only every month.  Like, I\u2019d think about, say, you\u2019re getting a certain rate every month, you could ask what is the effective rate each year.  If it were 1% each month, then after a year, you\u2019d have C*(1.01)^12= C*1.1268... so you\u2019re getting 12.68% each year. I think that would give you a path to doing it the other way around. 12% per year means you\u2019d multiply by (1.12)^(1/12)=1.0094888, so 0.9488% per month.<br><br>For example, this is the reason why, in pianos, to get the next key up, you multiply the frequency by 2^(1/12), so that once you\u2019ve gone up a whole octave, it\u2019s twice the frequency of the original note.
