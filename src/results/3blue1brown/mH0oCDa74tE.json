Cayley&#39;s theorem: &quot;Every group G is isomorphic to a subgroup of a symmetric group&quot;.<br><br>What that means for us (well, kind of) is that every form of beauty that has pleased our eye, anything and everything that we find symmetric has a mathematical representation. This is very powerful. Because of groups, we can abstract out the actions and objects across domains and study them.

That cute little fact allows the entire subject of group theory to be introduced, talked about, and be awed at by just studying the symmetry of snowflakes (among other things).<br><br>This realization after the fact is enlightening, but to have thought of it, and create a video this beautiful is sheer genius.

Viz., at 11 mins the claim that a permutation of 4 items is dual to the rotations of a cube. Since this is clearly untrue, the narrator loses a sensible viewer at this point. <br>Of course, the entire subject of group theory proves so incomprehensible and so obviously counterfactual that it quickly grows clear we&#39;re dealing with the equivalent of feng shui or chi or orgone energy. Like most advanced mathematics, group theory quickly becomes so riddled with evident gibberish, incapable of  being explained to any reasonable person, that it&#39;s rapidly self-evident that we&#39;re dealing with a scam. Like orgone energy or elixirs of immortality, we&#39;re dealing with nonsense cloaked by jargon which can&#39;t be made clear. The lack of clarity isn&#39;t a bug: it&#39;s a feature, necessary to cloak the essential meaningless of the discussion. <br>This becomes exceptionally clear around the 15 minute mark where the assertion that polynomials beyond degree 5 have no close-form formulaic solution that we&#39;re dealing with a con job. The narrator can&#39;t explain why this is allegedly true and can&#39;t provide any concrete evidence for it. The bafflegab quickly becomes so dense that multilevel marketing pitches and astrology come irresisitably to mind. <br>Obviously I&#39;m too stupid to understand advanced math, but least I&#39;m bright enough to realize it. People who spew this kind of jargon don&#39;t even seem to have that going for them. <br>The older I get, the clearer it becomes that if a smart person can&#39;t explain something to you in simple terms no matter how hard they try, you&#39;re dealing with a crude con job. No one has ever been able to explain group theory to me, or eigenvectors, or a tensor. Whenever I ask about details (&quot;Is a tensor a matrix of vectors?&quot; &quot;Oh, no, no, no,&quot; &quot;Is a tensor a matrix of derivatives?&quot; &quot;Oh, no, no, not at all,&quot; &quot;Is a tensor a continuous operation on a vector field?&quot; &quot;Haha, no, absolutely not,&quot; and so on ad infinitum) the response magically changes. No one can explain what group theory or a tensor or an eigenvector actually _is_, only what it is _not_.  Which of course means that the object under consideration can never be defined at all. <br>And if you can&#39;t define something at all, but can only spew jargon, in the slippery manner of a snake oil salesperson fum-fuhing and what-aboutism-ing, the only reasonably conclusion is that it&#39;s all a frantically failed attempt to distract us from the evident reality that what the person is talking about is fraudulent drivel and has no discernible meaning.", "comment_date": "2021-04-08T02:32:16Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Jonathan Engwall", "comment_text": "Here are a few interesting numbers: <br>GCD 196884 144 = 36<br>GCD 1000001 196884 = 1<br>196884 * 4 = 787536<br>GCD 787536 144 = 144<br>1000000 - 787536 = 212464<br>787536 * 212464 = 167323048704<br>GCD 167323048704 36 = 36<br>167323048704 / 36 = 4647862464", "comment_date": "2021-04-08T02:25:48Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Antonio A", "comment_text": "1,000,069", "comment_date": "2021-04-07T22:06:18Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "TinyFoxTom", "comment_text": "So 8.08*10^53 is the number of group actions that can be performed on a 196883 dimensional hypercube?", "comment_date": "2021-04-07T20:52:59Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Narret", "comment_text": "So this is what lovecraft was talking about...", "comment_date": "2021-04-07T16:57:45Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Christopher Brennan", "comment_text": "<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mH0oCDa74tE&amp;t=4m28s\">4:28</a> .......

The name JOHN should also have great meaning when new ML decoding is mastered by some very clever people I have come to follow recently !<br><br>The whole reason elliptic curve cryptography exists is because UNCERTAINTY is the foundation of the reality itself. We cannot do 5th degree polynomials because only the nonphysical reality is in the 5th dimension. That is, answers to measurements by you and me, are given to us as needed. JIT compiled to our mind. 5th dimension ? would be outside the computed framework we experience in. So restricting us to FINITE reality (anything FINITE is real), IN FINITE is FANTASY, IMAGINARY, a TOOL, a CONCEPT used to discover other things. If INFINITY was a real thing, damn would it be heavy. The simulation could quite easily have allowed us to keep playing god, smashing open reality like apes &quot;APE WANT KNOW, TELL NOW !&quot; but this becomes a source of rapidly increasing entropy and problems. Just as our population and social structure started to become a massive and exponentially accelerating problem a few decades ago. No surprise that Tom tells of an &quot;executive change&quot; in &quot;the big cheese&quot; and &quot;how things are done&quot; if I remember.. pseudo quotes.. but well worth discovering for yourself.. the few bored.. curious enough people out there do exist.. so I do not care that to 99.9% of people, and probably almost all of you for sure.. think I am a complete waste of space and would never entertain such a notion. As the legend himself puts it. Our entire problem is that of entropy, and fear. Fear manifests here as ego, belief (and disbelief), expectation.. and of course, that which we call fear.. noticeable fear.. fear at the forefront.<br><br>Fear to define it however, is the opposite of love. Fear is being SELF focused, and Love is OTHER focused intent. The only &quot;force&quot; is intent !<br>(LOVE is always UNCONDITIONAL), or it is lust, ego, desire, whatever. This is a very hard one to &quot;live it not just talk it&quot; when it comes to relationships, and it is no coincidence that those who matter most to us, are those who push our buttons most easily.

It just wont be the impossible dream he hopes it will be. Actually conveying meaning, information itself, from one person to another. The problem is of course, in a simulation there is only data, and interpretation by the PLAYER who could of course not actually be the avatar. It would have to be some entity, like a video game player like me, sending data to a server (in the same reality frame as Tom puts it) and receiving updates that change the data, allowing me to interpret the new worldview, make new choices, input new mouse movements and keystrokes.. and send that data back, etc etc.<br><br>So if you are working with virtual brain, and virtual hardware.. you are still 1 link REMOVED FROM THE SOURCE.

These groups tell us the number of ways objects can be symmetric within certain, different rules. Some of the rules will define the amount of dimension i.e. there&#39;s a group that encompasses 2D objects such as squares or prime polygons and all the ways they can be symmetric etc. Some don&#39;t have dimensions as the rules define the objects in relation to another like orders and such. Some groups are stricter than others, some have partly same rules and some have no common rules with each other at all. The groups get bigger and more complex as new ways of symmetry are allowed, such as adding one more dimension to allow symmetries through that dimension as well and that always increases the possible symmetries because there&#39;s more axis to play around with. And then they do this mind-boggling difficult maths, and play with rules and add dimensions and at some point, they noticed that even though they add one more dimension after 195,403 (presumably 195,404) and try to flip along this new axis...They can&#39;t create anymore ways to make the objects symmetric. Flipping the object, doesn&#39;t work. It isn&#39;t symmetric anymore. Even though they just added an axis and should by all accounts be able to flip it, but can&#39;t. <br>  I&#39;m sorry, obviously I&#39;m not a mathematician and even less qualified to understand anything about anything. This just sounds so fascinating and I wanna know more but I have no idea how to even approach this and most likely understood nothing. Did I get anything even remotely something along the lines of what you were trying to explain? Or am I just lost completely? Is it possible to ask for more content around this topic or do you have any source that tries to explain some of this in a bit more approachable way than just link to all the 4 giga files of the elements or whatever?

The teacher also noted rotation groups with orthogonal matrix ofc, but we didn&#39;t spend that much time into doing arithmetic with it :) I think teachers systematically don&#39;t like groups to more practical things due to the need of knowledge in fundamental maths class (You have to prove everything) and the fact the time is limited.

I don&#39;t know if you already know about Professor Mark Ronan and his interest in the Monster, but, if I may, a perfect pair of followup videos for this would be about (1) the dimension-24 kissing number 196560 and the Leech Lattice, and then (2) the largest Heegner number 163 and the character table of the Monster group.<br><br>Regarding the former video suggestion, on Mark&#39;s website, he writes:<br>&gt; The existence of the Monster was proposed by Bernd Fischer, immediately after he discovered the Baby Monster, and it was later constructed by Robert Griess as the symmetry group of an algebra structure in 196,884 dimensions. His work split the space into three subspaces, and his main task was to show there were symmetries intermingling these subspaces. The dimensions of the subspaces are:<br>&gt; 98,304 + 300 + 98,280 = 196,884<br>&gt; The first number 98,304 = 212 \u00d7 24 comes from the Golay code in 24 dimensions.<br>&gt; The second number 300 = 24 + 23 + 22 + \u2026 + 3 + 2 + 1 is the dimension of the space of 24-by-24 symmetric matrices.<br>&gt; The third number 96,280 = 196,560 \u00f7 2 comes from the Leech Lattice in 24 dimensions, where there are 196,560 vertices closest to a given vertex, forming 98,280 diametrically opposite pairs.<br><br>As for the latter video suggestion, I thought 3Blue1Brown style visualizations would be perfect for it. Since division on the complex plane looks like rotating+shrinking, factoring a (Gaussian) integer into its prime components means finding a set of path from the integer&#39;s gridpoint (a+bi) to the identity gridpoint (1+0i) where each path consists of integer-jumps to another gridpoint (i.e. division by a prime factor), and unique factorization means that the paths all contain the same set of integer-jumps, merely in different orders. That is to say, each gridpoint has a single set of numbers corresponding to its jump options (prime factors). However, for some reason, unique factorization is no longer guaranteed when the complex plane is vertically stretched, unless the amount of stretching is the square root of one of the 9 Heegner numbers (1, 2, 3, 7, 11, 19, 43, 67, 163). In other words, when the stretching is by any amount other than those 9, there will be gridpoints with multiple sets of numbers corresponding to jump options (prime factors). Now, the fact that there is only a finite number of options for preserving unique factorization is already pretty interesting, but that the largest amount of stretching is the square root of the dimension of space spanned by the functions generated by character table of the largest sporadic group makes it even more so. I wonder if the fact that 1+2*3^4=163 has anything to do with it, too.<br><br>Anywho, thanks again for your time and effort!
