But I feel like I just put it together algebraically, and not really intuitively.  So maybe I\u2019ll go back and do it just for 2x2. <br>To find an inverse, you want to find vectors x_1,...,x_n which map to standard basis vectors e_1,...,e_n.  So let\u2019s do the thing for each vector x_j.   And the i-th element in vector x_j is x_ij, because that\u2019s how notation works in a matrix.  So, the parrellelopiped spanned by e_1,...,e_{i-1},x_j,e_{i+1},...,e_n (which has volume x_ij) maps to the paraleopiped spanned by all the vectors of the first matrix A with a_i replaced by e_j.  Since the volume of that is x_ij * |A|, we can find x_ij by finding the determinant of A with the i-th vector replaced by e_j. <br>And what\u2019s neat-o about determinants and co-factor expansion is that you can do it across or down any row or column you like, which means let\u2019s do cofactor expansion down the column that\u2019s almost all zeros. So, because of this, the determinant of the thing is the same as (plus or minus) the determinant of the (j,i) minor of A (note that its ji not ij). <br>So, the ij-th entry in the matrix inverse of A is (+/-) 1/|A| * |M_ji|. Which is what Wikipedia says what the Cramer rule for matrix inverse is. <br>(I\u2019m not keeping track of pluses or minuses because I.

Thanks for the awesome video Grant! You should do a video on differential forms and the generalized Stokes&#39; theorem. That would just be fantastic! I just finished reading Vector Calculus by Hubbard and Hubbard and would love to see some geometric intuition into the crowning theorem of that text.

Actually, the standard terminology is to call them &quot;orthogonal&quot;.  The word &quot;orthonormal&quot; typically describes a set of vectors which are all unit length and orthogonal.  But, if you think about it, dot-product-preserving matrices <b>should</b> be called orthonormal, since not only do they keep orthogonal vectors orthogonal (which, confusingly, several <b>non</b>-orthogonal matrices due as well, such as simple scaling), they also mush preserve lengths.  For example, how confusing is it that we can say the columns of an orthogonal matrix are orthonormal, but a matrix whose columns are orthogonal may not be orthogonal.  GAH!  Maybe my casual mistake here can help nudge the tides of terminology towards something more reasonable, though of course that wasn&#39;t the intent.", "comment_date": "2019-03-17T04:31:15Z", "likes_count": 1323}]
