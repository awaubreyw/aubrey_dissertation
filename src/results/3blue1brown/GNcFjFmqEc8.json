I&#39;m not a student, I accidentally got into engineering. I just needed to replace my speakers power supply/cord, which a new cord would be expensive in relevance to the cost of the speaker. I decided to look up a little bit about electrical, math, and some science to repair it. 6 months later and some help from amazing sources like you I was able to work with an Arduino UNO! Math is a rabbit hole and so is all the subjects its beautifuly displayed in. It helps us to understand this abstract world.<br>I see that school and I were not very capable. In fact I did not understand any of it. Failed alot but I have my GED.  There is a lot of ways of learning and I found that I do not &quot;space out&quot;. Im a visual person and that works for me when i let myself apply that type of learning and problem solving style. I find engineering is pretty visual and I don&#39;t think I&#39;ll ever be able to stop asking questions upon many subjects.

If I use Grant\u2019s idea of projecting a curved rectangle placed on a sphere on to a cylinder, but visualized it in different way: a sphere can be \u201cdeformed\u201d as a cylinder. I don\u2019t if this counts as visual calculus, but when I drew the transformations of different area elements around the median, the top and bottom caps, I had found that if I turn these rectangular elements into just mere squares and construct the projection, the areas visually are the same. Hence forth, I found out that if the cylinder has a height of R and radius of R as well, the total surface area results in 2*pi*r^2 + pi*r^2 + pi*r^2 = 4*pi*r^2. This is really amazing because the fun doesn\u2019t stop here: <br><br>Now for volume calculations, when you look into how the wedges are projected during the \u201cdeformation\u201d process, you\u2019d find out that the differential pyramids that consume the sphere deform into triangular prisms. The volume of the triangular prism from basic geometry yields 1/2(bh)*R where b and h = base and height of the triangle and R is the height of the prism itself. This can be written as A*R where A is the longitudinal cross section of the prism. The pyramid on the other hand can be written and 1/3*A*R. By geometry, it can show that the \u201cdeformation\u201d process yields 1/3*A*R volume addition, which means that the volume ratio of the deformation of the spherical \u201cdifferential wedge\u201d/Cylindrical \u201cdifferential wedge\u201d is 4/3, which hence proves that the volume of the sphere to the projected cylinder therefore is 4/3, which proves the volume formula.", "comment_date": "2022-02-18T09:07:38Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "\u2063 \u2063", "comment_text": "You teach me more in 16 minutes than school has in 10 years.", "comment_date": "2022-02-17T23:56:43Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Galactix", "comment_text": "Nice lies dude....

If you start with a square module im the sphere (lets say, theoretically small enough to be considered not distorted by curvature, or, tending to zero per zero side lenghts) and always turn its heigh to horizontal in the plane cilinder, as the division of latitudes are in degrees they will keep one side steady. The other side, stretches to zero as to the poles,  just like the projection, following the inverse of tangent value. By flipping all rectangle simce the equator until the poles, will always have right correspondent widht at the open cilinder, and height just like the medium value of the longitudinal division that tends to zero as it approaches the pole. So you just have to follow sin/cos/tang math to finish it, to get the rectsngle height, as if were derived from an integer tunction search of the modules.... This is why the height of the rectangles in the cilinder get smaller, following the width of the square approaching the sphere pole, while &quot;latitudes&quot; still divided by degree, fixed, steady, correspondent to longitude im the cylinder.

You start at a and go to b but you wrre always at b, but it looked like a but it now only feels like a but you see it as b<br> So maybe there is no reality but ones own. Maybe the only books are those which were created by artists. But then again the one power that created such beuties as mathematics and geometry must be some kind of an artist on their own. Try telling something for 40 times and look if it turns into reality. Then try hearing the same thing for 40 times and then look in the mirror and see if it is reality. But if it does happen, who really came up with the idea of telling it 40 times in fifferent bodies under different circumstances and who really knows who started the idea and for what reason? Who wished for ill who woshed for heaven? And what happened to you, wqs it a good wish or a bad one? Who spread the idea in whose mind? So the actual question is not how, it is who, for there is. Look at time when imam is calling for prayer. It has a timeline qnd a timesheet. Look atyour watch when everything seems to going wrong. Like everything you touch is useless everybody says the same thing. Maybe the time flows only for you and you only. Maybe a choice is nearby. Maybe your choice will affect the whole of universe. Maybe time is against you for one reason. The watchmaker cannot keep it any more. And maybe does not know why himself. Then who was making sure the time was flowing at that hour? You need 1 person, 1 thing that reminds you of what is real. It is only a person actually because you are a person. When you feel like death is nigh trust the hand that is nearby for that hand was also put there for you to stay on the path you have chosen. Some things were never the way they appeared and some were even worse. But the one person who understood that we were all in prison a madeup world where everyone had certain roles to follow. Only to give the torch to the next one. If by any chance he was in control, he had to play his hand openly and he had to show true vulnerability and never hide his true emotions and whatever that was real with the only person whom he knew was real. And that person showed everyone that metaverse is the next life path we all chose for all of us. The end was really near. And it took a lot of suffering and a shock doctrine of highest oreder to convince us all that life on earth was precious. Everyone we knew to be great on earth was pointing to the same person. Because she was the collector of moments. The only real moments she never underrstood or pushed her to choose something. And the only questions she kept on pondering were the only questions to be asked. Whenever a genuine question comes up in a classroom never dismiss it. Never dismiss the student who asked that question. Because every crucial moment in history might have happened for her. So that she would change the minds of those who are in control. For nobody owns anything. Only time seemed real. That too can be lost. Or made again and again and again. When a pregnant cat shows up at your door accept it to your home, when a child asks for something try to give it to her if you will not or cannot give that thing, never shout never be angry about it. Whose fault is it? The blaming game runs deep to the depths of time. If there will be a day of judgement and a day of reckoning then all the greats will come and ask for forgiveness or will come to a verdict. This is what we call a butterfly effect. It is a collection of moments. Memories. Intentions. But the highest ordeals always. Carrying an unwanted child is nothing if you can carry the weight of the whole world. Perspective is what matters. Isnt it curious she knew all the answers? Maybe it was us who put them there. We saw joy but also true originality true spirit. That made all the difference. It will not happen again. Because she will not be convinced. We are sure of it. She knows the details. Look for her signs. We are all afraid of her. \ud83e\udd70\ud83e\udd70\ud83e\udd70\ud83e\udd70\ud83e\udd70\ud83e\udd70\ud83e\udd70\ud83e\udd70\ud83e\udd70\ud83e\udd70\ud83e\udd70\ud83e\udd70\ud83e\udd70\ud83e\udd70\ud83e\udd70\ud83e\udd70\ud83e\udd70\ud83e\udd70\ud83e\udd70", "comment_date": "2022-02-03T21:41:24Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "AvoirJoseph | 50 Subscribers challenge with videos", "comment_text": "I&#39;ve always wondered how those formulas are created because back then, I just accept it as a fact", "comment_date": "2022-02-03T14:43:54Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Kgfcccv Vhbbbc", "comment_text": "Thank you.

Having retired from math olympiads for less than two years at that point, I took it as a personal challenge to solve this problem without looking at the solution. \r <br><br>After about 40 minutes of struggle, I &quot;found&quot; the solution, and after watching the video I was even more proud of myself since my solution was quite different from the one presented in the video. Alas, recently I stumbled upon this video again and while thinking about my solution I found a serious flaw in it. I started working on it again, and found a fix, albeit much less elegant than what I originally thought.<br><br><br>Since my approach is quite a bit different from the one presented by Grant I decided to write my thought process as I remember it in hopes that whoever reads this will learn something new, mostly about mathematics but also maybe a bit about arrogance and humility. \r(also spoiler alert: there will be a surprising connection to a different video by 3b1b!)<br><br><br>\r<br>So, my first idea was quite similar to what was done in the video, I tried to reduce randomness by fixing one of the points and in a similar fashion quickly realized that we need to find the average area of the sphere triangle formed by 3 random points on a sphere.\r After playing with it for about 10 minutes I didn&#39;t find anything useful and got slightly annoyed that this problem doesn&#39;t succumb to my power (I was quite overconfident back then as you can see!). <br><br>\r<br>Anyway, as a diligent student I decided to look at lower dimensions. Similarly to the video, I computed the probability in the 2D case by doing an easy integral, and then, for a good measure, did a 1D case which is really just 4 cases since 1D-circle is discrete\r (I think this might have been a good thing to mention in the video, as to show that considering the simplest case is also fruitful even if it seems somewhat artificial). So, I got 1/4 and 1/2, and my intuition told me that the answer should be 1/8 and there might be some induction involved, although so far I had no idea how to prove it.<br><br><br>\r<br>Here, I came to the first main idea: if fixing one point isn&#39;t enough, let&#39;s try to fix two points! So, let&#39;s say we&#39;ve fixed points P_1 and P_2. What can we say about the other two? If we denote by S the plane through P_1, P_2 and the origin O, then, with a bit of convex geometry/linear algebra it&#39;s quite easy to see that the tetrahedron contains O if and only if the triangle P_1 P_2 P contains O, where P is the intersection of P_3P_4 and S. That is, P lies in the &quot;opposite&quot; triangle to the triangle P_1 P_2 O (it might be useful to draw some pictures here, but alas I can&#39;t do this in the comments for obvious reasons).<br><br><br>\r<br>But how to compute the probability that S is in this triangle? Here is the second idea: I claim that this probability is proportional to the angle P_1OP_2! \r<br>Indeed, by rotational symmetry it&#39;s obvious that it only depends on this angle and if you put two such angles side by side then the probabilities, as well as angles, will add up, so by cutting the angle into n equal pieces and passing to the limit it&#39;s not hard to convince oneself in this proportionality.<br><br>\r<br>But what is the proportionality constant? To find this let&#39;s pass to the extreme case, when the &quot;triangle&quot; P_1OP_2 is the whole plane S. Then the intersection lies in it if and only if P_3 and P_4 are on the different sides of S, so it is 1/2 (since hemispheres both have measure 1/2).<br><br>\r<br>So, it remains to integrate the average value of the angle P_1OP_2. But didn&#39;t we discuss just a few paragraphs above that this is just an answer to the 2D case?! So, we just have to multiply the 2D answer by 1/2 and get 1/8! And the same surely works for all dimensions by induction.<br><br>\r<br>\r<br>I was so blinded and amazed by these ideas that I thought &quot;this must be it&quot; without being too critical of my own work. Do you see the mistake in the above argument?<br><br><br><br><br><br><br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>The mistake is that I was too shameless in my use of independence. After we condition on the points P_1 and P_2 lying on some plane S, they are no longer independent and so the reduction to the 2D case doesn&#39;t work! The easiest way to see this is that if they were independent the probability that they were at most epsilon away from each other would be of order epsilon, but in reality \rit is of order epsilon^2 (the area of a small spherical cap with radius epsilon).<br><br>So, if they are not independent, then how are they distributed? To find it, we need help from our good old friend Archimedes, who more than two thousand years ago discovered that the area of a spherical cap is proportional to the height of this cap! (see 3b1b video &quot;But why is a sphere&#39;s surface area four times its shadow?&quot; to learn more about this piece of mathematics). And this height, up to some factors, is nothing but a cosine of a half of our desired angle P_1OP_2. So, the problem is basically reduced to integrating arccos(x) from -1 to 1. <br><br><br>At this point if I was on the real exam I would probably notice the symmetry x-&gt;-x, but this feels like the same kind of symmetry as in the video, and I wanted to avoid it, although one can say that I already used it back when I was computing the proportionality constant (by the way, here this symmetry can be visualized quite nicely by patching two complementing spherical caps to get the whole sphere).\r Thankfully, the antiderivative of arccos can be computed explicitly, if a bit painfully, and we can finish off the problem and get the correct answer 1/8 without the ingenious trick of considering point and its opposite altogether.<br><br><br>\r<br>This turned out to be not quite as elegant as I have hoped for, and it really only works in dimension 3, but I still hope you can learn something from it.", "comment_date": "2021-11-06T14:49:32Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Droid Android", "comment_text": "A sphere by definition has multiple face per any distance.

The ring at the top of the dome shades the circle to 100% of it&#39;s surface.  The ring at the ground/equator shades the circle 0% of it&#39;s surface, since it is edge-on to the light.  Splitting the difference, since the circle/sphere is completely symmetric, by definition, we get that the circle only &#39;uses&#39; 50% of the shade, relative to the surface area.

Area of the shadow ring = 2\u2022(pi)\u2022R\u2022sen(@)\u2022R\u2022d@\u2022cos(@)<br>\u25aa\ufe0ethe reason is the proportion from the width of the sphere&#39;s ring to it&#39;s shadow is cos(@), you can find it doing the same process as he showed earlier. And since the radius of the circunference is the same as before (R\u2022sen(@)), we just need to multiply by cos(@);<br><br>III.Which ring has double the area of any shadow ring&#39;s area ? The one that has double its angle <br>\u25aa\ufe0esince sen(@)\u2022cos(@) = sen(2@)/2, we can write the formula from last answer as 2\u2022(pi)\u2022R\u2022sen(2@)\u2022R\u2022d@/2 = A2. If you noticed, the formula is very similar to the aproximation of the area of a sphere&#39;s ring, the differences being the 2@ and the 1/2. With that we can reason that the area of a shadow&#39;s ring at any angle ( from 0\u00b0 to 45\u00b0 but i wont get too especific ) its half the area of a sphere&#39;s ring with double the angle.<br><br>IV. How the shadows relate to every other ring ? For very small angles any given shadow ring has half the area of its corresponding sphere&#39;s ring area.<br>\u25aa\ufe0e If you divide the area of a shadow ring (A2) by the area of a sphere ring (A1) you get  A2/A1= 0.5 \u2022 sen(2@)/sen(@) . Now the smaller the angle @ gets, sen(2@) getss closer to sen(@). In other words, when  @&lt;&lt;1, sen(2@) = sen (@) or sen(2@)/sen(@) = 1 if @ is different from 0 =&gt; A2 = 0.5 \u2022 A1 or 2 \u2022 A2 = A1 . (I know this kind of goes against answer 3, but i believe its correct and its more a matter of perspective);<br><br>V. Why does this imply that the area of the circle is 1/4 the area of the sphere ? <br>Well to make a perfect shadow circle you only need half of the sphere, but the area of the shadow circle is half the area of whatever makes the shadow. THEREFORE  1/2 \u2022 (area of the sphere ) = 2 \u2022 (area of the circle) or (area of the sphere ) \u2022 1/4 = (area of the circle).", "comment_date": "2021-01-17T18:11:57Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "KARAN CHOWDHARY", "comment_text": "Due to direction effect four direction north south East and west", "comment_date": "2021-01-17T13:58:06Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "f.\u3061\u3087\u3074\u3093", "comment_text": "\u306a\u308b\u307b\u3069\uff01\u308f\u304b\u3093\u306d\uff01", "comment_date": "2021-01-14T00:12:31Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Krzysztof Filip Maksymilian Stypu\u0142a", "comment_text": "I think it all would be more simple if we at start know that there is no rectangle at all and if we would calculate it all by polygons, not using pi.", "comment_date": "2021-01-12T07:55:35Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "der muck", "comment_text": "<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNcFjFmqEc8&amp;t=04m20s\">04:20</a> : No I would&#39;nt...<br>simply because there are no rectangles to begin with.<br>The shape of the tiny surface-parts of the sphere alters from close to a square (@ the equator) towards close to a triangle (@ the pole)...<br>Now I hope that you are getting the curve.   ^.^   , \u00b0[ Nice wording, muck! ]<br>...<br>&amp; <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNcFjFmqEc8&amp;t=06m28s\">06:28</a> ...<br>a tangent to a circle meets how many points on the circle?*<br>Sorry...

The measure of an (n-1)-sphere of radius r in n-dimensions is (\u221a\u03c0r)\u207f/(n/2)! using the convention that (-\u00bd)! = \u221a\u03c0 (so +(1/2)! = \u00bd\u221a\u03c0, +(3/2)! = \u00be\u221a\u03c0, etc.). You can verify this for the 2-sphere in 3-dimensions and the 1-sphere (or circle) in 2-dimensions. The perimeter for the (n-1)-sphere is 2\u03c0r(\u221a\u03c0r)\u207f\u207b\u00b2/((n-2)/2)!, so the ratio of perimeter for (n-1) sphere to the measure of (n-2) sphere is 2\u221a\u03c0 ((n-1)/2)! / ((n-2)/2)! ... which for n = 3 is 2\u221a\u03c0 1!/(\u00bd)! = 2\u221a\u03c0/(\u00bd\u221a\u03c0) = 4.<br><br>So, whatever explanation the video is presenting should explain <b>all those other cases</b> too!

It&#39;s gotta explain that too. Or else, something specific to 3 dimensions has crept into the explanation.

Being picky though, there are some significant gaps in the proofs which are very technical to fully rigorously cover.<br>In each proof, we end up approximating areas using certain, simpler geometric shapes, such as approximating the rings with annuli (the actual rings are on a curved surface). Of course, these approximations get very close in area as the d-thetas get small, but then you&#39;re also summing up more and more of them. How do we know that summing up lots of these little errors doesn&#39;t cause a mistake?<br>As an analogy, put a circle with radius 1 in a square grid of paper (grid as fine as you want). Approximate the circle by the zig-zag of lines following the grid, just outside of the circle. Even if your grid is very fine, the length that you&#39;ll work out for your approximation of the circumference is always at least 8 (and exactly 8 if the fineness perfectly divides the diameter, such as if you take squares in your grid of length 1/2^n). So your &quot;approximation&quot; never approaches the correct 2pi.<br>This doesn&#39;t happen here. It&#39;s intuitive &quot;why&quot;, since the normals of our &quot;approximating surfaces&quot; are in some sense getting closer to the actual normal to the surface so are &quot;better&quot; to some higher degree.

Although, this was perhaps meant to be hidden under the rug for simplicity&#39;s sake. This is totally fine but I provide an explanation below.<br><br>The approximation of the sphere does not consist exactly of rectangles but of trapezoids. So what is meant by the statement &quot;the sphere rectangles have the same area as the cylinder rectangles&quot; and depicted in the diagram is not exactly true. What is true is: if the area of the &quot;sphere rectangles&quot; is off from the area of the sphere by E_S &gt; 0, the area of the &quot;cylinder rectangles&quot; is off from the &quot;sphere rectangles&quot; by E_CS &gt; 0, and the area of the &quot;cylinder rectangles&quot; is off from the area of the cylinder by E_C &gt; 0, then as the &quot;coverings&quot; get finer, each error goes to 0 so E_S + E_CS + E_C goes to 0.<br><br>The fact that E_S and E_C goes to 0 is of course believable (this is how area of surfaces are defined). However arguing E_CS goes to 0 is slightly less trivial. Here is the idea without going into the math. The error between the trapezoids and its corresponding rectangle is small in the &quot;band&quot; around the equator. This band of well behaved trapezoids get thicker as the &quot;covering&quot; gets finer. This error is much worse near the poles but the error is trivially at most the area of the two &quot;caps&quot; which fit on the top and bottom of the &quot;band&quot;. But as the covering gets finer the band gets thicker, so the area of the caps go to 0.", "comment_date": "2019-10-15T20:17:01Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "ala olivier", "comment_text": "\u0647\u0630\u0627 \u062c\u062f \u063a\u0628\u064a \u0641\u064a \u0627\u0633\u0647\u0644 \u0645\u0646 \u0647\u064a\u0643 \u0628\u0631\u0647\u0627\u0646", "comment_date": "2019-10-15T20:16:33Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Buddhabr0t", "comment_text": "so did anyone actually manage to prove it? i failed completely.", "comment_date": "2019-10-15T19:41:45Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Yugantar Bhasin", "comment_text": "Is it aphine transformation", "comment_date": "2019-10-15T07:42:14Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "\ud558\ucc3d\uc6b0", "comment_text": "please support koreans :D", "comment_date": "2019-10-14T22:46:52Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "MiChaeTzu Twice Jjang", "comment_text": "Isn&#39;t the differential of spheres volume it&#39;s surface area?", "comment_date": "2019-10-14T21:05:06Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Sumant.

Take reptiles like crocodiles and snakes. When they are dealing with their environment, especially with humans are their movements random when trying to defend themselves or catch a prey? <br>The reason I am asking is that humans who have studied these animals know how to safely handle them. Is there\u2019s a geometry of their movements (depending of the species), meaning angles at which the reptiles can or not move? Is there a mathematics of the movements: safe zones vs unsafe zones (even if you factor in the personality of the creature). Can mathematics provide limits of the movements defined by the movements of the head, tails, etc, their maximal reaches, etc. Can someone totally figure them out? In other terms, is there a general mathematics of classes or species of animals, insects, etc, and how they do what they do. Maybe people know this movements by empirical modeling (like when are producing a CGI, cartoon) or maybe there could be a way of knowing for sure by using limits of body behavior. What man? How about the man of man in sports? Can science mathematically determine the area where the human body can do certain things (given a position) and limits that determine what is outside of the body capabilities (mechanically). An example would be the mathematical modeling of boxing, track and field (and all the Olympics disciplines).", "comment_date": "2019-06-25T07:45:13Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "TG_IlIllI", "comment_text": "\uad6c\ubd84\uad6c\uc801\ubc95 \uc4f0\uba74 \ub418\ub294\ub385 \uc774\ub77c\uace0 \ud560\ub824 \ud588\ub294\ub370 \uacb0\uad6d \uad6c\ubd84\uad6c\uc801\ubc95\uc73c\ub85c \ud480\uc5b4\ubc84\ub9ac\ub139", "comment_date": "2019-06-25T02:42:24Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Stars-drifterwurst", "comment_text": "Why only English?", "comment_date": "2019-06-23T13:06:14Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Gabriel Rolszt", "comment_text": "It&#39;s 1:37am wtf am I doing here, I don&#39;t even study math in my college...", "comment_date": "2019-06-23T04:38:33Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "\ub0b4\uac00\uba39\uc5c8\uc5b4", "comment_text": "\ud55c\uae00 \uc790\ub9c9 \uc554\uc784;;", "comment_date": "2019-06-23T04:32:14Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Vi\u1ec7t C\u01b0\u1eddng", "comment_text": "I think it shoul be 2n2R2 not 4nR2 n is pi", "comment_date": "2019-06-22T11:30:14Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "alex Lo", "comment_text": "Find surface area by projection 3d surface to 2d plane is still contrast to common sense.", "comment_date": "2019-06-21T21:01:36Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Vi\u1ec7t C\u01b0\u1eddng", "comment_text": "I love you video but i need vietnamese sub it.

The idea was that the exercise should be done by the student, in their free time (which was a bit of a problem with 8 other courses treating you a similar way, but that&#39;s a different story), but there was just no link to what I was supposed to learn. I usually was fine with exercises and I understood the algorithms to solve the various problems, but I rarely understood <i>anything</i> from the theory. I barely passed the oral exams, coming in with a top math score from high school that year.

The circumference length of each ring is 2*pi*R*sin(theta), since the distance from the ring to the axis is R* sin(theta) (trigonometry). Hence, the area of a ring is 2*pi*R*sin(theta)*R*d_theta = 2*pi*R^2*sin(theta)*d_theta (1)<br><br>2. To calculate the area of a ring&#39;s shadow, I used some trig relations as well. In this case, the thickness of the ring shadow is R*d_theta*cos(theta). Therefore, the area of the ring shadow is 2*pi*R^2*sin(theta)*cos(theta)*d_theta (2)<br><br>3. Multiplying by both sides expression (2), we get 2*pi*R^2*2*sin(theta)*cos(theta)*d_theta<br>I&#39;ve put the number 2 right next to sin(theta)*cos(theta) to explicit the trigonometrical relation:<br><br>2*sin(theta)*cos(theta) = sin(2*theta)<br><br>That specific angle is 2*theta.<br><br>4. So, this means that the area of the shadow of some ring with a corresponding angle of theta is equal to the area of a ring which has double of this angle.<br><br>5. Notice that, when theta ranges from zero to pi/2, we get to form all of the rings related to their shadows in the superior hemisphere. The total area of the shadow is the sum of all the thin ring shadows. Thus, that is equal to half the area of the hemisphere. That is, the area of the shadow (pi*R^2)  is 1/4 of the surface area of the sphere.

(As if you put the sphere in the cylinder and sliced thru both, directly crosswise with a knife).\u00a0 Say, maybe the cylinder is 1 meter, sliced into 1000 1mm slices, and the corresponding 1000 slices of the sphere.<br><br>Notice that at the equator the surface area of a slice of the cyl is exactly the same as the surface area of the slice of the sphere, obviously.\u00a0 So to prove the whole cyl area is the same as the\u00a0 sphere are, all we need to do is demo that any sphere band has the same area as any of those 1mm cyl bands<br><br>(Let L = the length of the cyl band).\u00a0( Let W = the width of the cyl band).\u00a0\u00a0 Obviously, at any chosen latitude, the length of the sphere band is\u00a0\u00a0L x (cos of latitude).\u00a0 The width of the sphere band is W / (cos of latitude).\u00a0\u00a0 L x W = area.\u00a0\u00a0 Obviously the 1/cos and cos cancel each other out in the area calc, leaving\u00a0 any sphere band exactly the same\u00a0area as any cyl band.<br><br>In practice for the given case:\u00a0\u00a0 A\u00a0cyl \u00a0band area is simply 1mm x 1000mm x pi = 3141.6 mm^2.\u00a0\u00a0 So, say for example at 60 deg latitude, the sphere band width is 1mm / cos60deg, and the sphere band length is 1000mm x pi \u00a0x cos60 deg.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The cos of 60 deg = 0.5.\u00a0 \u00a0(1mm\u00a0/ 0.5) x (1000mm\u00a0x 3.1416 x 0.5)\u00a0\u00a0 =\u00a0 31416.6 mm^2, which, notice, \u00a0is exactly the same are as any cyl band\u00a0\u00a0 <br><br>So every cyl band is exactly the same size as its corresponding sphere band, so obviously the cyl must be the same surface area as the sphere.", "comment_date": "2018-12-09T20:29:46Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Dmytro Voskoboinyk", "comment_text": "\u041f\u0440\u043e\u0441\u0442\u043e \u043f\u043e\u0442\u0440\u044f\u0441\u0430\u044e\u0449\u0435. \u041d\u0430 \u0433\u0440\u0430\u043d\u0438 \u0444\u0430\u043d\u0442\u0430\u0441\u0442\u0438\u043a\u0438 \u0442\u0430\u043a\u0438\u0435 \u0443\u0440\u043e\u043a\u0438!", "comment_date": "2018-12-09T20:15:37Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "turra_schmidt", "comment_text": "Integral", "comment_date": "2018-12-09T20:14:54Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "mohamed ouhibi", "comment_text": "can someone please answer me this:<br>why does greenland on the map seem almost the size of africa while the world map is a projection of earth on a cylinder <br>shouldn&#39;t greenland conserve its area after projection?", "comment_date": "2018-12-09T20:14:31Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Pablo Palafox", "comment_text": "Hey!! awesome video, as always! <br>I was just wondering, in <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNcFjFmqEc8&amp;t=8m13s\">8:13</a>, shouldn&#39;t the Height Squish Factor be d/R instead of R/d? <br>Thanks for this material :D", "comment_date": "2018-12-09T20:05:32Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "dpfphd95e95dpz", "comment_text": "I hate aids, especially in my problem solving toolbox.", "comment_date": "2018-12-09T19:55:06Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Brian Plotkin", "comment_text": "How does this guy consistently produce the best videos on YouTube?

Once we got to the shadows, we started reasoning that the shadows correspond to 1/2 of every second ring of the whole sphere. Unfortunately, this means that the outermost shadow has apparently nothing to do with the widest ring on the sphere but is 1/2 of that last ring (which is not a ring anymore). All this looks too similar to the SPHERE -&gt; CYLINDER mapping shown earlier in the video, where we were intuitively hoping for 90 deg rotation, which was not guaranteed but was possible and showed later. So, is it possible (I did not have time to work it out alone and give results ... maybe I am not even capable, but I&#39;ll know when I try) to do other mapping so the shadows really do correspond to the rings that are casting the shadow?", "comment_date": "2018-12-06T13:01:57Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "whocantexplain", "comment_text": "This is heavy", "comment_date": "2018-12-06T13:00:45Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Jesse", "comment_text": "zzzzzzZZZZZZZ", "comment_date": "2018-12-06T12:22:27Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Suresh Kempaiah", "comment_text": "Try shadow for cylinder and cone it Varies .then\u00a0work out for Sphere ....", "comment_date": "2018-12-06T12:13:22Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Mary Pusineri", "comment_text": "On <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNcFjFmqEc8&amp;t=5m49s\">5:49</a>, the width scale factor is R/d.

When we sum up all the projections coming from rings of the upper hemisphere, we get an area of \ud835\udf0bR^2.\u00a0<br>But this turns out to be equivalent to a quarter of the total sphere surface.\u00a0<br>We have the factor 2 from the sinus rule, as explained above, but also a factor 2 due to the jumps between consecutive summations of the equivalent 2\u03b8 rings.<br>\u00a0<br>The factor from the jumps becomes clear when we just do the following. First we take a ring in the upper hemisphere between angle \u03b8 and \u03b8+d\u03b8. This gives a projected ring which has half the area of the ring between 2\u03b8 and 2\u03b8+d\u03b8. The consecutive ring in the upper hemisphere lies between \u03b8+d\u03b8 and \u03b8+2d\u03b8. The projection has half the area of the ring between 2\u03b8+2d\u03b8 and 2\u03b8+3d\u03b8. We observe that we have skipped the ring between 2\u03b8+d\u03b8 to 2\u03b8+2d\u03b8. This happens for every following step. In a way we  are jumping to conclusions :-). When we finished all the rings of the upper hemisphere from \u03b8=0 to \u03b8=\ud835\udf0b/2, we have integrated not half the value of the rings areas (from \u03b8=0 to \u03b8=\ud835\udf0b), but also one half of the rings between \u03b8=0 to \u03b8=\ud835\udf0b).

Since each semicircle projects down into a circle of area (pi)r^2, this implies the area of the projected circle is exactly half the surface area of the semicircle that projects it.\r<br>\r<br>Define (d) as the distance from the vertical plane to the bottom of each semicircle strip. For strips of small width, each strip has area 2(pi)(d)(width), while their projections have the limit area 2(pi)(d)(projected width). The ratio of the two areas is then exactly the proportion of the two widths. Taking the height (h) as the distance from the x-y plane to the bottom of the strip, we can show  (<a href=\"https://imgur.com/a/BRRQc72\">https://imgur.com/a/BRRQc72</a> ) that the ratio (projected width)/(width) equals (h)/(R). \r<br>\r<br>As we take more strips, splitting the sphere more and more finely, the values of (h)/(R) going up the circle from the middle plane increase evenly.

And vitally, with enough strips, any strip at (h)/(R) will have a &quot;partner&quot; strip very close to 1 - (h)/(R) such that their average 1/2((h)/(R) + 1 - (h)/(R)) approaches 1/2.\r<br>\r<br>Thus in the limit of fine strips (more and more strips have a partner,) the average value of (h)/(R) = (projected width)/(width) = (projected circle area)/(surface area) approaches 1/2, and the projected area (pi)r^2 is half the surface area of the semicircle.<br><br>EDIT: Oh, that&#39;s clever.

Here goes: Take that label cilinder and mark half of the top and bottom circumferences with a marker alternating equal parts marked and blank. ( theoretically this works only as the length of each mark approaches zero, but practically go with 20)<br>Also beneficial is to stagger the marked areas of the top circle with the ones directly below it on the other circle. Next for each of the blank segments top and bottom, mark the point on the center circle (the one touching the sphere) directly above or  below the middle of the segment. After this you can cut out equilateral triangles from the ends of each of the blank segments towards these points halfway along the cilinder. In our case 20 triangles. These triangles you can flip upwards and attach to the marked portions of the original circles. You end up with a kind of spiky bracelet, but if you then fold the points of those spikes together until the edges are flush, you should approximate the sphere you started with.

This is why books that &quot;leave the details of the proof as an exercise to the reader&quot; are infuriating to most students from elementary school all the way to my colleagues in grad school. It has nothing to do with the usefulness of the explanation in general but idea that you are trying to tease an explanation from <i>that particular person</i> through a manner that you are not guaranteed that they click well. The cylinder is fine. The shadows are stupid. Triangulation of the surface is more interesting (to me) because unlike the rectangles explanation, the triangles do not get deformed at any angle of theta/phi. There is no point in leading a student along a line of reasoning they do not care for; the best way to learn math is to sandbox it on one&#39;s own or to get a personal Aristotle who can react in real time to the student&#39;s line of reasoning.<br><br>Here&#39;s my question:<br><br>Consider the 1/8 slice of the sphere (theta and phi run from 0 to pi/2). Now have a plane intersect the sphere at three points: the pole and the two vertices along what would be the equator. The plane-sphere intersection is an equilateral triangle. The area of said triangle is an estimate for the area of the slice. Now cut theta/phi into n pieces and let the rays from the center of the sphere to the surface pass through vertices of new equilateral triangles i.e. refine the triangular mesh on the sphere slice. When n = 2, there will be 4 equilateral triangles of side length Rsqrt(2-2cos(pi/2/n)) by the Law of Cosines, n = 3, 9, etc. If we add up all these triangles as the mesh becomes finer and finer...<br><br>we do <i>not</i> get pi/2 R^2. Considering we can get arbitrarily close to the surface of the sphere, the limit should converge to the area of that slice (4piR^2/8).

We have a right triangle with an angle of theta and a hypotenuse of R.  In this case, d is opposite from theta.  Using the above mnemonic, we can remember that O/H = sin(theta), ergo d = R sin(theta).  The circumference of a circle is 2 pi R, so the inner circumference of the ring is <b>2 pi R sin(theta).</b><br>Thus the ring&#39;s area is approximately <b>2 pi R^2 sin(theta) d(theta).</b><br><br>Q2: The good news is that our inner radius d is the same as it was for the ring on the sphere, ergo the inner circumference will also be the same: 2 pi R sin(theta).  What we need to figure out is the thickness of the ring&#39;s shadow.  By drawing another right triangle where the hypotenuse is the thickness of the ring, R d(theta), we can see that the thickness of the shadow is adjacent to theta in our new triangle.  Using the mnemonic above, we can see that A/H = cos(theta), ergo the thickness of the shadow = R cos(theta) d(theta).  To finish off, we multiply these two to get an area of <b>2 pi R^2 sin(theta) cos(theta) d(theta).</b><br><br>Q3: Using the identity that 2 sin(theta) cos(theta) = sin(2*theta) reveals that we can rewrite the area of the shadow as <b>pi R^2 sin(2*theta) d(theta).</b>  This is the same as the area of the ring except that we&#39;ve dropped the 2 from in front, signifying that we&#39;ve cut the value in half, but we&#39;ve also doubled the value of theta.  This means that the shadow at a given value of theta has half the area of the ring at double that theta value.  For example, the shadow at theta = 30 degrees has half the area of the ring at 60 degrees.  Thus, as we go to the next shadow, we skip past one of the rings and jump two rings ahead instead of one.<br><br>Q4: Partially answered above, but as we compare each shadow to a ring on the sphere, we have to skip every other ring, jumping two rings ahead for each shadow.  The other half of this puzzle is to remember that we only generated shadows from one hemisphere rather than the entire sphere.  Since we skip one ring for each shadow, that means we need to use all of the rings from the entire sphere (except for the ones we jump over), instead of just using the rings from one hemisphere.  An easy way to see this is to think about the last shadow, at theta = 90 degrees, which corresponds to half the area of the ring at 180 degrees, which is the last ring on the sphere.<br><br>Q5: The area of the shadows sums up to the area of a circle of radius R.  However, each shadow is only <i>half</i> the area of one of the rings, and only half of the rings have been accounted for.  A half of a half is one quarter.  Ergo, a circle of radius R only has half the area of one hemisphere of the sphere, which in turn only has half the area of the whole sphere, and thus the area of the circle is one quarter that of the entire sphere.", "comment_date": "2018-12-02T22:32:37Z", "likes_count": 575}, {"comment_by": "Gammon", "comment_text": "Can I have you as my math prof?

The circumference of the circle is 2*pi*R*sin(theta).\r<br>3. The area of the ring is then 2*pi*R^2*sin(theta)*d theta\r.\r<br>4. Construct the small right triangle used in the first solution and translate it so the side opposite theta is touching the shadow of the ring.\r<br>5. It follows that the thickness of the shadow is sin(theta)*R*d theta.\r<br>6. The circumference of the shadow equals that of the ring because of the way the shadow is projected.\r<br>7. The area of the ring&#39;s shadow is then 2*pi*R^2*(sin(theta))^2*d theta\r.\r<br>8. The ratio of the shadow to the ring becomes simply sin(theta).\r<br>\r<br>Part II\r<br>1. The ring we need in question 3 has two times the area of the given shadow, or 2*sin(theta) times the area of the given ring.\r<br>2. Using the trig identity given in the video (sin(2*theta)=2*sin(theta)*cos(theta)), it is clear that the area of this new ring is sin(2*theta)/cos(theta) times the area of the given ring.\r<br>3. Therefore, the circumference and in turn the radius of the new ring is also sin(2*theta)/cos(theta) times the circumference of the given ring, or the radius is R*sin(theta)*sin(2*theta)/cos(theta), due to the method of approximating the area.\r<br>4. Dividing by R, we find that the sine of this &quot;new theta&quot; is sin(theta)*sin(2*theta)/cos(theta), or using the identity again (2*sin(theta))^2.<br>5. After graphing (or maybe otherwise solving), it is clear that for all values of theta until pi/4, there is an angle which corresponds to it such that its ring is twice the area of the shadow of the ring at angle theta. Past that, there is no such angle.<br>6. Pi/4 as an angle corresponds to a shadow with radius sqrt(2)*R/2. All of the rings&#39; shadows smaller than it together correspond to the entire hemisphere.<br>7. The area of the total shadow covered by these ring shadows is half of the total.<br>8.

Using the trig identity from the video, we see that the correpsonding shadow with half area must be the one at angle theta/2. So picking a ring of the shadow, gives us a ring of the sphere which has two times its area and two times its angle which means its two times further away therefore we only get every second ring. We need two full shadow discs to match the area of every second ring, so we need 4 shadows to match all rings. In the limit i suppose it does not matter if its every even or uneven ring.
