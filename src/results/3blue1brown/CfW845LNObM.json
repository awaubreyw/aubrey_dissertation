I get students who simply accept the principle first time and don\u2019t like for me to over analyse the subject. <br><br>Saying all that I pretty much get it up to 5 minutes in this video and then lose it but that\u2019s progress ...thank you sir .", "comment_date": "2020-10-10T21:29:19Z", "likes_count": 5}, {"comment_by": "Squeeze", "comment_text": "this video should be retitled &quot;useless things you will most likely never use in your life&quot;", "comment_date": "2020-10-10T00:04:49Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Albert Jackson", "comment_text": "What a stupid ass title!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!", "comment_date": "2020-10-09T07:56:24Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Block Deichmann", "comment_text": "very elegant videos, thanks for the efforts!", "comment_date": "2020-10-06T16:27:25Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "theseal12", "comment_text": "Episdoe 13 of this series never came ;c", "comment_date": "2020-10-06T15:35:25Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Anton Ladan", "comment_text": "Poor -0.618..., always left out", "comment_date": "2020-10-06T14:02:08Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Glep", "comment_text": "you make me want to go back to college and learn advanced math. thanks.", "comment_date": "2020-10-05T07:49:59Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "temoku", "comment_text": "Good one!!", "comment_date": "2020-10-04T13:31:32Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Melon", "comment_text": "i love chocolate", "comment_date": "2020-10-04T11:53:25Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Ajay Kumar", "comment_text": "\ud83d\udc4d", "comment_date": "2020-10-01T12:32:00Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Matthew Murdock", "comment_text": "Is this another trick into learning math? \ud83d\ude02", "comment_date": "2020-09-29T11:43:54Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Involved Observer", "comment_text": "I  do not understand that 1K who disliked this video.", "comment_date": "2020-09-28T20:01:02Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "The Garden of Eatin", "comment_text": "Forget calculus class.  Nothing worthwhile lays on the other side.  I think we&#39;d be better off as a species without schools.<br>You think you go to school to gain knowledge.  Well, they can trick you into thinking you&#39;ve gained knowledge by having you rote memorize lots of stuff.  Like a parrot, or post-it note.  You&#39;re still just as useless because you will always be more expensive than a post-it note.  They rarely impart skills or abilities because that takes actual work to do. <br>School is more treated as a filter.  Instead of helping people become capable of the skills they&#39;ll need in life, schools dump a load of &quot;work&quot; on the students and see who can and who can&#39;t accomplish it.  Those who can get through school are the ones who are innately capable of whatever station your degree will let you hold, those that don&#39;t pass obviously shouldn&#39;t be given those positions.  Okay, except that school &quot;work&quot; seldom resembles the actual job they&#39;re seeking.  We never once fixed a broken airplane in mechanic school.  It&#39;s like passing building blocks through a triangular filter when you want to have rectangular blocks, those who are good at whatever school &quot;work&quot; is might not be good at the actual job that eventually matters.  And the vast majority of it is completely pointless.  Why did the state require me--a pilot and mechanic--to read Romeo and Juliet, Hamlet and Much Ado About Nothing?

May god strike you down to the deepest, ass rapiest pits of hell for trying that argument.  &quot;People with well rounded educations make better citizens in general as they&#39;re better equipped to participate in discourse, commerce and politics.&quot;  That statement is not only 100% right, but it is also 100% correct.  But here&#39;s why it&#39;s a bad argument:  There&#39;s this thing about Maslowe&#39;s hierarchy of needs.  School needs to prepare people to take care of their needs FIRST, so that they aren&#39;t hungry and freezing.  THEN make them into characters from Star Trek TNG where everyone has 9 Ph.Ds in theoretical literature and sit around in their spare time pondering math equations.  Ability to reliably take care of themselves first.  Schools are broadly speaking failing at that.

I seek clarification as I have done in every area of math that has remained obscure since it was (supposedly) taught to me in school. I don&#39;t consider math &quot;hard&quot;; I have come to realize that many of my teachers simply didn&#39;t understand my queries and I hadn&#39;t the skills (at the time) to explain precisely what eluded me.<br><br><br>You haven&#39;t DEFINED a function, and I&#39;m at <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfW845LNObM&amp;t=3m45s\">3:45</a> in the video. When I took a year of freshman calculus 45 years ago, I never grasped what a function actually was, so telling me that &quot;x squared&quot; was a function was meaningless. Defining a derivative as the slope of a curve, but without admitting that it&#39;s really the slope at a given point on that curve, isn&#39;t exactly helpful here, unless those watching this video already have a thorough understanding of the term &quot;function&quot;. Defining an integral as the area under a curve isn&#39;t helpful when we&#39;re not dealing with curves.  Finally, speaking of integrals and derivatives without having yet defined &quot;function&quot; is useless. All the examples in the world (of a function) are of no help without defining that word. <br><br><br><br>At approximately <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfW845LNObM&amp;t=5m10s\">5:10</a>, you mentioned considering functions as &quot;transformations&quot;, but OF WHAT? The word &quot;function&quot; has yet to be defined. In my experience 45 years ago, the frustration level was enormous as the professor kept writing &quot; f(x) = &quot; on the board, followed by an alphabet soup of equally incomprehensible letters and numbers, meaningless without understanding what a function was. Clearly he pulled the alphabet soup out of thin air, somehow magically arriving at an answer. <br><br><br><br>Listening at <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfW845LNObM&amp;t=6m08s\">6:08</a>, I can only wonder WHY anyone would think of calling the expression &quot;x&quot;. Why only take part of that mess to label as &quot;x&quot; ? I listened for another 90 seconds but everything became more muddled. <br><br><br><br>I tried taking the &quot;pre-calculus&quot; version of algebra, thinking that perhaps improving my fluency in algebra would help, but it did not. For students watching this video, I hope you&#39;ve already taken a year of calculus and earned at least a B in the course. If you&#39;re struggling in your calculus class and happen to be watching this video, you need to find someone who understands how you think and can fill the gaps in YOUR understanding. I had to change majors as I was unable to find any such person on or off campus.

Your example is a calculus problem, but what you are using is Newtons method to show us the solution (A numerical analysis solutiong). And the only reason why you can do this, is because you choose 1+1/..=x. This way of thinking is natural for a young student, but we all know that this is only true because the infinite series converges toward something. By showing without explaining the methods at hand, you give people a misunderstanding of how calculus work. The newton method can only approximate, since it uses the taylor theorem (around the root f(r)=0) wich gives us:<br>0=f(r)=f(x+h)=f(x)+h*f&#39;(x)+O(h^2) where h=r-x. For newton method to work we have to let x be an approximation to r. And then if f&#39;&#39; exists and is continuius (C^2), then the previous formula is true and we have: x_{n+1}=x_n - (f(x_n))/(f&#39;(x_n)) where (n &gt;=0). When you are talking about it as a funktion acting as a transformation, it does exactly the same thing. So from my viewpoint, you haven&#39;t actually given a new way to think about calculus. You have only given them a way for how functions can be &quot;solved&quot; with numerical analysis.<br><br>Still a great video as always :) (Sry for my bad english.)", "comment_date": "2018-08-15T11:08:59Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Tamoor 622498", "comment_text": "I start calc 1 in a month.", "comment_date": "2018-08-14T12:55:01Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Lambda Function", "comment_text": "This was obvious to me when learning calculus.

Cosmological constant is clearly a complete lapse in brain function. <br><br>Why do you need such complicated math for a binary system.

If you can&#39;t do that pick a different field.<br><br>Gravity and spacetime act dynamic as opposed to the &quot;progressive flow we imagine in human perception&quot; <br><br>Direction is subjective, so why do you think there could be rate of change?

I just figured since you just might hear me this time.. With the rate of ocean temperature, sea level won&#39;t be an issue on it&#39;s own. It&#39;s weakening of the plates due to the ocean reaching a limit on how much heat it already has. Water that is hot is dangerous. A large gas/ashe release just might flip albedo. Good Luck. Your only hope is a 180\u00b0 south. Use nuclear power, and end your construction before 2022. We&#39;re in overtime.. Whatever happens is no longer reactionary. It was not me who was wrong, it&#39;s everyone else. Except this time, we all lose because of the mistakes of the narrow view you all seem to share. You should have tracked and respected ground water in the Sahara, Sonora, and whatever is on the opposite side of the planet from the russian borehole. Any similarities with aridly stressed climates is a dangerous mark. The heat comes from the core, not the sun. We would be frozen otherwise. So, when the sun heats the air, the oceans heat up, and since the ocean was already absorbing 90% of our heat? Well, it&#39;s unable to heatsink.<br>You already know.

Two measurement tools working in tandem.. Row, then column. The space.. Is FILLLED.. Not empty... That alone is something you can&#39;t measure. So you use PROBABILITY, but consider what it means if you don&#39;t apply value. The universe has value in some places, calculate it.<br><br> Logic only zones, you dunce. You never measured classical physics with abstract values. What&#39;s a newton? Admittedly, they had far more to worry about since they already had one thing nobody seemed to care was wrong.. Yet broke the system.<br><br>Victorian bullshit. <br>You don&#39;t deserve what I could have done.. <br><br> I am waiting to die, while I examine the joy that I get, knowing that I will withhold my work and take it to my fucking grave..

And when you study theory, you understand why graphical intuition is not good enough to make you understand mathematics. <br>It can get you started, it&#39;s even great in some (but it&#39;s a limited amount) of cases (for example the multiplication of complex numbers as a rotation).<br>It&#39;s not a case if in Italy they teach Mathematical Analysis, not Calculus, at universities. The subject is the same, but it&#39;s a more modern version of it. Calcus is what mathematicians did up to like the 19th century, after that they started making math more rigorous and thus the Mathematical Analys became a thing.<br>And while some things are still good to be connected to graphical intuition, others are not.<br>For example, while you can introduce the derivative as what it was for Leibniz and Newton (the slope of a graph), you should clearly state that in the current state of Mathematics it is defined through its formulae, and after that we can give a graphical interpretation of it. Same goes for the Riemann integral, and many more things. <br>But when you start to study Linear Algebra for example, graphical intuition is just a relatively weak supplement.<br><br>I hope I explained myself !", "comment_date": "2018-05-20T09:34:15Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Work Guy", "comment_text": "Math is logical voodoo", "comment_date": "2018-05-20T09:31:05Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "meddelhed", "comment_text": "Your pronunciation of &quot;phi&quot; fills my heart with joy!", "comment_date": "2018-05-20T09:28:34Z", "likes_count": 4}, {"comment_by": "D F", "comment_text": "I discovered this in 10th grade by my own.

But some equilibria are stable because if you go slightly off that point the force would push you back towards it (compressing the outputs) while others are unstable because the force pushes you away from that point once you leave it (spreading out the outputs).", "comment_date": "2018-05-19T16:07:16Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Soepler", "comment_text": "I saw this in Analysis 2 and Numerical Linear Algebra..

There are two angles of stability in which the magnet can come to rest: the first (phi) arising from any initial angular orientation of the magnet. The magnet will rearrange itself to be aligned with the field. The second (phi&#39;s little brother) originates from the unstable angle that is exactly 180 degrees out of phase.
