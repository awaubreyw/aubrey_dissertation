So the patterns just tell us how points on the plane converge relative to other points.

E.g., a geometric series converges for |r| &lt; 1 and diverges for |r|&gt;1 and when |r| ~= 1 it may or may not converge or more complex formulas(so things that are quasi-geometric may have complex convergence patterns around |r| ~= 1). The mandelbrot boundary really is just the convergence of an infinite polynomial that twists and turns as it is &quot;twisted up&quot; by repeated iteration. Because it is symmetric(by the squaring) it creates a very obvious pattern that we think is interesting(but really it is no more interesting than any other except it is one of the simpler patterns).<br><br>What is more important is that all recursive formulas have innate structure and that is what is far more important than any fractal itself. There is little point in studying the Mandelbrot fractal for it&#39;s own sake... but indirectly one can learn about recursion itself and recursion is the key to life.

Also through Lambda Calculus any number system N where N is the base to some Logarithmic function with an infinite amount of digit placements is said and proven to be Turing Complete. It has or possess the ability to count and do to repetitious cycles and being repeatable through transformations or rotations also provides the ability to have an inverse as well as being able to be recursive in nature. Once you have all of these properties because of the nature of Associativity especially within addition, multiplication, function composition, logical And, OR and XOR, as well as Group Theory it is inevitable that a fractal will emerge. The Graph of the Mandelbrot Set alone which is based on the properties and relationships of numbers within a given iterative function does in fact possess the properties of being able to count as it can perform both addition and multiplication. How and why? Without first glance, the identity equation y=x or its function form f(x) = x which is a diagonal line that bisects the XY axis in the 1st and 3rd quadrant has the three trigonometric functions tan(t), sin(t), cos(t) embedded within itself. <br><br>Let&#39;s compare the identity equation with the slope-intercept form of an arbitrary given linear equation y=mx+b. Here m is the slope and b is the y-intercept. Within our identity equation y=x we can see that m is understood as 1 due to the multiplicative identity and b is understood as 0 due to the additive identity. As these two identities does not change the solution space. So where does the trigonometric functions come into play?<br><br>We need to understand the definition of slope first. It is defined as rise over run or rise/run and it can be calculated from any two points on a given line by the formula m = (y2-y1)/(x2-x1). This can also be understood as the change in y over the change in x or simply dy/dx and you will see this notation all through Calculus and within Physics and other sciences that pertain to rates of change. So far this is still all Algebra, but where does Trigonometry come into play?<br><br>We can take any given line of the form y=mx + b and substitute it with y=(dy/dx)x + b. We haven&#39;t changed anything nor its behavior. How does this relate to the trigonometric functions? Here the (dy/dx) or the slope of the function is also the tangent of the angle that is produced by the line y=mx+b and the (+)x-axis. We can now write this as y=tan(t)x + b. Through trig substitution we can now write this as y = (sin(t)/cos(t))x + b. We know that the x and y-axes are orthogonal, perpendicular to each other as they create a right angle making them either 90 degrees or PI/2 radians from each other. We know that the line y=x bisects this angle which is the same as 90/2 = 45 degrees or PI/2/2 = PI/4 radians. For simplicity of numbers I will use degrees within this example. <br><br>Now we can see that y=x is the same as y = tan(45)x + 0 = x since tan(45) = 1, and the same is true for y=(sin(45)/cos(45))x + 0 = x since sin(45)/cos(45) = sqrt(2)/2 / sqrt(2)/2 = 0.7071... / 0.7071... = 1. And here we haven&#39;t even performed any operations to our variables. We only identified them. This works because y=x is or has perfect symmetry. <br><br>I&#39;ll take this even one step farther and show that the first and simplest of all arithmetic equations 1+1=2 satisfies and defines the Pythagorean Theorem. We know that the Pythagorean Theorem is based on Right Triangles from the equation A^2 + B^2 = C^2. So how does addition of 1 onto itself that produces 2 both satisfies and defines this? We first have to establish the fact that the equation 1+1 = 2 is also a definition to the Unit Circle. Yes, it is, but first we need to understand the General Equation to any Arbitrary Circle. This is defined as (x-h)^2 + (y-k)^2 = r^2 where (h,k) is the center point of the circle, (x,y) is any point that lies on the circle and r is the length distance or magnitude of the circle&#39;s radius. The normal unit circle is typically has its center at (0,0) and its equation is reduced or simplified to, (x-0)^2 + (y-0)^2 = 1^2 == x^2 + y^2 = 1 and this is how the trigonometric functions end up having Pythagorean Identities. In our case of 1+1 = 2. This is still the unit circle only that it has been horizontally translated 1 unit toward the right along the (+)x-axis. The equation for the unit circle generated by 1+1= 2 has its center at (1,0) with a radius of 1 and is defined as (x-1)^2 + (y-0)^2 = 1^2 == (x-1)^2 + y^2 = 1. How does this work? If we take the equation to the unit circle at the origin (0,0) we can see that x^2 + y^2 = 1 is a specialized case of the Pythagorean Theorem since x^2 + y^2 = 1 is a form of A^2 + B^2 = C^2. <br><br>Another property that exists from the Pythagorean Theorem is the fact that it is the governing Theorem or basis to the Distance Formula which can be applied to any spatial dimension N where N is the degree of a given polynomial x^N where each spatial dimension of that order has exactly N orthogonal - perpendicular coordinate elements where each and every element are perpendicular to one another. <br><br>Dimensionality:   Polynomial Function:   Vectorized Coordinates<br>0D - Constant      Non-Zero Constant       {}<br>1D - Linear:          f(x) = x                            {x} <br>2D - Quadratic:    f(x) = x^2                        {x,y}<br>3D - Cubic:           f(x) = x^3                        {x,y,z}<br>4D - Quartic:        f(x) = x^4                        {x,y,z,w}<br>5D - Quintic:        f(x) = x^5                        {x,y,z,w,v}<br>6D - Sextic:          f(x) = x^6                       {x,y,z,w,v,u}<br>...<br>ND - Approximates to a Circle or Sphere like structure: f(x) = x^N  {x,y,z, ... N-2, N-1, N} where N approaches Infinity. <br><br>And if you notice each spatial dimension above and below a given polynomial order are vaguely its derivatives and integrals. For example, the derivative of f(x) = x^2 is f&#39;(x) = 2x. And the integral of f(x) = x^2 is F(x)dx = (1/3)x^3.  Here we can drop any constants or coefficients and see that 2x is of the order of x, and that (1/3)x^3 is of the order of x^3. <br><br>All of this is possible not only from 1+1 = 2, but it is embedded within y=x due to the fact that the identity equation has perfect symmetry!", "comment_date": "2021-10-16T18:57:27Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "fleh6390s", "comment_text": "Very beautiful and fun to watch, wow!", "comment_date": "2021-10-16T18:55:28Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Armands Arseniuss Skolmeisters", "comment_text": "Expanding points?

Additionally, at local minimums or maximums of P(z), we should expect points with P&#39;(z_n) = 0, such that any choice of P(z) with such local minima/maxima ought to necessitate the existence of some set of complex numbers u (for which P(u) != 0), where z_0 = u, and as n goes from 0 to infinity, P&#39;(z_n) = 0.<br><br>My question is this: does it make sense to consider the &quot;size&quot; of this set u? By this, I mean, can we make statements about which function P_1(z) or P_2(z) has a greater boundary length?", "comment_date": "2021-10-16T17:03:14Z", "likes_count": 6}, {"comment_by": "Star Lord", "comment_text": "Been a while since I&#39;ve thought about Complex Analysis, but is there any clear relationship between Montel&#39;s Theorem and Picard&#39;s Great Theorem?", "comment_date": "2021-10-16T16:58:27Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Uvais Hassan", "comment_text": "I envy people who get all this.", "comment_date": "2021-10-16T16:49:28Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Arthur C", "comment_text": "<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqbZpur38nw&amp;t=23m20s\">23:20</a> Is it possible that this one cycles between the central region and a side region rather than between the side region +1 and the side region -1 ?", "comment_date": "2021-10-16T16:48:03Z", "likes_count": 2}, {"comment_by": "Screambmachine", "comment_text": "please consider pronouncing c differently than z", "comment_date": "2021-10-16T16:44:10Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Yaitz 331", "comment_text": "So why is it that the Mandelbrot set is so intricately tied to fractals of parameter spaces?", "comment_date": "2021-10-16T16:35:10Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Rhizometric Reality", "comment_text": "When will Humans figure out how to seed fractal self constructing molecules", "comment_date": "2021-10-16T16:30:40Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Fai Phei", "comment_text": "<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqbZpur38nw&amp;t=3m44s\">3:44</a> \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02", "comment_date": "2021-10-16T16:30:13Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Hagop Ket", "comment_text": "The wages of sin is death as it says in the Holy Bible.
