I figured out the inductive one myself once but had no idea of this one. I can&#39;t help thinking of a Zen-like comment: &#39;Every line has two ends&#39;! More seriously, can  this proof be extended to more than 3 dimensions? The more usual proof gives zero on the right-hand side of the equation for polytopes in all even-numbered dimensions (think of Vertices - Edges = 0 in polygons), and 2 for all odd-numbered ones.  I&#39;m impressed that you&#39;ve been able to detach the proof from any particular 3-D shape and consider the graph by itself. <br><br>I&#39;m wondering what would correspond to &#39;objects&#39; and &#39;things that connect&#39; in 4 and higher dimensions? Or could it be done starting with just the edges and vertices and noting how these define higher-dimensional sub-shapes in 4,5,6...N dimensions in the way that here the 0-D vertices and 1-D edges define surfaces and ultimately the single 3-D shape... and remembering that the N-1 dimensional &#39;facets&#39; enclose the shape (polytope with convex hull) in N dimensions. <br><br>Although intuition and visualization are not much use in more than 3 dimensions, you can perhaps get some feel for higher-D by seeing an object in N dimensions as being infinitely thin in N+1 dimensions. For instance, if extending a tetrahedron to 4-D - visualize it as an infinitely thin hyper-surface in 4-D, then add just one more vertex outside the tetrahedron in the 4-D space - and join the dots, i.e. new vertex to the existing four in the 3-D plane (well, hyper-plane).<br><br>I think the above is correct as far as it goes but please let me know if not!", "comment_date": "2018-02-01T22:15:03Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "legotechnic27", "comment_text": "I am somewhat confused, I thought you couldn&#39;t have multiple edges between the same vertices.

Mart\u00ednez", "comment_text": "+3Blue1Brown First, thank you, your videos have a quality and elegance that are almost impossible to find on youtube. For instance, I watched your &quot;Crash Course on e^x&quot; a number of times (if only they showed that approach at my uni), and I think &quot;What does it feel to invent math?&quot; is beautifully encouraging. I really hope you continue to make videos like these.<br><br>I had watched this video before, but today I revisited it and started playing with dual graphs and I have learnt that they are not unique in general, since they depend on the embedding of the graph, which may not be unique. This means that the assertion &quot;original graph &lt;-&gt; Dual of dual graph&quot; is not true in general. For example, the dual of the dual of a tree is easily dependent on the embedding of the dual. I proved that if it is 3-connected (implying a number of nice things among which I used that its dual is unique), then the dual of its dual is indeed the original. Now, some questions come to my mind:<br>Is it always possible to find an embedding of the dual such that the dual of the dual is the original?<br>Is it possible to find a sequence (original, dual(original), dual(dual(original)),...) such that the period is different than 1 or 2? It certainly cannot be different each time since the number of edges is constant and the number of graphs with k edges is finite. And the most general question,<br>What conditions are necessary and sufficient for the dual of the dual graph to be unique and equal to the original?<br><br>Anyway, rather than correcting one second of your video, I wanted to show that your videos are very inspiring, so please keep it up.", "comment_date": "2015-10-31T23:25:12Z", "likes_count": 24}, {"comment_by": "Lucas Monteiro", "comment_text": "I am astonished by this proof", "comment_date": "2015-10-14T13:19:59Z", "likes_count": 9}, {"comment_by": "SynthRose", "comment_text": "I&#39;m confused as to what happened to the outer face of the graph or outer point of the dual.
