A Hilbert curve&#39; is a particular space-filling curve which, besides possessing aesthetic qualities, seems to have some applications in computer graphics. &#39; Such a curve is defined by a function which maps a parameter t onto pairs of values (x,y), where t is the length along the curve. Cardinal B-splines have knots that are equidistant from each other. B-splines can be used for curve-fitting and numerical differentiation of experimental data. In computer-aided design and computer graphics, spline functions are constructed as linear combinations of B-splines with a set of control points. A B\u00e9zier (pronounced &quot;bez-E-A&quot;) curve is a line or &quot;path&quot; used to create vector graphics. It consists of two or more control points, which define the size and shape of the line. ... The shape of a B\u00e9zier curve is calculated using interpolation, a method of approximating the path of the line between each control point. A long run average cost curve is known as a planning curve. This is because a firm plans to produce an output in the long run by choosing a plant on the long run average cost curve corresponding to the output. It helps the firm decide the size of the plant for producing the desired output at the least possible cost. Wait was this too many facts?

As long as the limit of iterated segmentation hits every point in the original shape, then the limit of the partial spacefilling curves will converge to a spacefilling curve   This way you can make really funky space filling curves, like defining one which can fill a circle (divide into seven internal circles and a bunch of roulux triangle-esque shapes which can given a space filling curve in a similar manner to actual triangles by using arbitrary curve segments instead of line segments, the partitions will just get super distorted).", "comment_date": "2017-07-24T05:21:32Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Jared Hicks", "comment_text": "yo i had to make one of those koch snowflakes in cs class using gpdraw in java", "comment_date": "2017-07-22T03:24:38Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "TheRedstoneTaco", "comment_text": "What would a pi-dimensional fractal be?", "comment_date": "2017-07-22T03:13:58Z", "likes_count": 6}, {"comment_by": "Muzik Bike", "comment_text": "The subtitles are Spanish for some reason", "comment_date": "2017-07-21T21:44:45Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Tristan Frodelius", "comment_text": "You wrote the music?
