I think it requires a lot more math, ie, a few more variables, but the basic function can be conceptualized neatly in your one set of factors.

I mean, in this sense, in a real, physical system Romeo and Juliet would need time to know about each other\u00b4s feelings, so they could recalibrate their own ones. But the graph suggests instantaneous simultaneous knowlegde about each other&#39;s feelings, wich would violate causality, theoretically. In this case, how the graph woul look like?<br><br>PS.: one way to solve this by a physical mening would be giving them a correlation, but not a causality, right? So, if the cause for Romeo to like more Juliet is the same for juliet to dislike Romeo (let&#39;s say, Juliet&#39;s family fortune). So when the fortune increases, Romeo get more interested in Juliet, but Juliet get more interested in oher guys - and vice-versa. The last condition is that both Romeu and Juliet know the value of the fortune at same time. So the graph would match with the system, right?<br><br>What I mean in the end is that, in logic, could be a great correlation graph, but not a causality graph.

The reason is simple when you look at A^2 = (P^-1 D P) (P^-1 D P) = P^-1 D^2 P since P P^-1= I. If A doesn&#39;t have unique eigenvalues, it gets a little trickier. We can use the Jordan form A = P^-1 J P = P^-1 (D+N) P where D is diagonalized and N is nilpotent with the same order as the algebraic multiplicity of A (let&#39;s call that n). And the Taylor series of N would have a n terms, which in most cases is finite.

I&#39;d like to add that there&#39;s another way to visualize how e^{At} gives you the evolution when A is the derivative (in the sense dx/dt = A x), which is based on the other well-known relation involving e: e^x = lim_{n-&gt;inf} (1 + x/n)^n . First, note that this is also valid when x is a matrix! Let&#39;s use A*t. Then, if we look at n=1, we have  e^{At} ~ 1 + At  , which multiplied by the initial state x(t=0) will give us a very crude approximation to x(t)  (since A is the derivative, and in the limit t-&gt;0 that&#39;s what it means!). Now, for n=2, e^{At} ~ (1+At/2)(1+At/2) , which can be seen as using the derivative to take us to an intermediate point at t/2, and then again from that point to t/2 later. That is a better approximation to x(t). You see where this is heading... n-&gt;inf will be like using the derivative infinite times to make infinitesimal (dt ~ t/n) update steps of the original x(0)... which gives x(t).

We start from the proof, go through it, take what we need, and then go back to prove the theorem pretending that it is where we started.&quot; It is utterly frustrating that the contemporary educational system presents information in such a counter-intuitive progression. Each time I learn a new concept from the textbook, I have to painfully grind through the definitions and theorems without any context, then reverse-engineer the proof to figure out what motivates their formulation in the first place. It seems to me that such a format is encouraged in school so that the genius may come across smarter than everyone else. It also scares people off, especially those who aren&#39;t passionate about math. It makes them feel like math is not for them and there is no way they can comprehend such abstraction.
