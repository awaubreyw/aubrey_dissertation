But I think there&#39;s something wrong. <br>I don&#39;t know much about game theory, and I don&#39;t know how well game theory fits the Wordle challenge - probably it&#39;s not a natural but a forcible fit, workable but not ideal. But one idea from game theory that I think works here is the idea of a mixed strategy.<br>Essentially, you&#39;ve established a correspondence between a &#39;vocabulary&#39; or &#39;corpus&#39; (let&#39;s call it) and a starting word: given a set of possible target words what one word provides the maximum reduction in uncertainty for future guesses. You then label this as the best starting word.<br>Now if the &#39;corpus&#39; were different - say, words with no double letters, or words without &#39;e&#39; - then your method might choose a different word that would reduce uncertainty. <br>The catch is that whether you &#39;know&#39; what corpus the target word comes from. You&#39;ve set up the problem thinking that you DO know the corpus, but the Bayesian in me suspects that you do not. <br>So maybe you have a 50% certainty that the word has an &#39;e&#39; in it, and there&#39;s 50% chance that it has no &#39;e&#39;. In the first case, perhaps the initial guess that provides the maximum reduction in uncertainty is WORD1 and in the other case the initial guess is WORD2, and WORD1 &lt;&gt; WORD2. Wouldn&#39;t the best strategy be then a mixed strategy: flip a fair coin and use WORD1 if and only if heads comes up, and WORD2 otherwise?  I think so. Not sure, though. Maybe if the reduction in uncertainty for the two starting words is very different.<br>Effectively this is why even the best Wordle players vary their initial words: they are reflecting their uncertainty in the collection of words.<br>Now yes there IS an established corpus of answers, but it&#39;s very very large. One can partition it into two sets a much larger number of ways. Does this matter? I don&#39;t see how. I think that acting as if the corpus were unknown is a prudent way of acting.<br>I also think that it matter how one defines success: is it the probability that you&#39;ll guess the right answer in six guesses? Or is the &quot;objective&quot; is to minimize the number of guesses? There are probably five words that incorporate 25 different letters, so that by putting in those five words you might discover all the letters in the target word, so with some skill at anagramming, you can determine the target with a high degree of certainty. This would maximize the likelihood of getting the target by the sixth guess, but it feels wrong to me. The objective of WORDLE seems to be closer to the second - minimize the number of guesses - but it&#39;s probably somewhere between these two objectives, and my reaction to the presence of uncertainty is to pursue a mixed strategy.<br><br>Anyway, I admire the work you do, and look forward to your future productions.

But I wonder if there is yet another &#39;bit&#39; of information that could be used in the analysis.  Not all letters have the same &quot;value&quot; - there is a need to identify the vowels and simultaneously to identify the consonants.  <br><br>I tend to pick my first word at random (I even started one game with &quot;FUZZY&quot; just because I felt like it, and with no apparent reduction in my ability to solve the puzzle within 4 guesses) with the caveat that I generally want a word that has two different &quot;vowels&quot; (A, E, I, O, U, and Y).  If I use a word that has three vowels, I will be wasting a letter in future guesses because I will need to use a vowel that I already know is or is not in the solution.  If I choose a word with one vowel, the result divides the vowels into two categories - the vowel I guessed is either in or not in the solution, and I know nothing at all about the remaining vowels.  An alternative strategy that I have not tried (tomorrow is another day) would be to choose &quot;ADIEU&quot; as my first guess to minimize the uncertainty about the vowels and then use subsequent guesses to look for the correct position of the known vowels.<br><br>At the same time I am working on the vowels, I use my remaining guesses to identify consonants.  I tend to divide consonants into three rough groups - the common (e.g., R, T, P, S, D, L, N, M), the uncommon (Q, W, J, Z, X, V), and everything else (F, G, H, K, C, B) consonants (informed by vague recollections of the values of the letters in Scrabble).

There might be an interesting point to be made from the best theoretical analysis to develop a solid strategy in wordle. I believe the best theory would be one from a linguistic standpoint.<br><br>For example, we know that (in the English language) nearly every word needs a vowel. So early words that eliminate all the vowels are handy - adieu, ouija, etc. For a 5 letter word, you can probably expect 2 vowels, frequently 1 vowel, but rarely 3 or more. Clear follow up words that eliminate any remaining vowels (if necessary) as well as picking up on letters that commonly form consonant blends are useful. In a 5 letter word with 1-2 vowels there will have to be a consonant blend or two. S, R, L, H, and rarely w are our letters commonly used to form consonant blends.<br><br>You might decide that it&#39;s unnecessary to eliminate all the vowels in the first 2 guesses, and that it&#39;s better to eliminate the more common vowels and letters used in consonant blends on the first guess instead. Therefore, SHARE is actually a very useful word as a first guess. It picks up 3 of the most common letters used in consonant blends, as well as the common A vowel - and perhaps the most useful vowel, E.<br><br>Of course, a curve ball can always come your way. You need to remember the use of double letters, and there are the consonant digraphs that are tricky such as KN, NG, or MB. A linguistic analysis may not get you the absolute best starting word, but it can give you the tools needed to beat the game better.

Part of what\u2019s  great and enduring about card games is a sorted deck of cards should have a uniform likelihood of each card being drawn, and while the rules of the game make some sets of cards rare and valuable,  we don\u2019t ever know the strategies and hands of our opponents until we begin to play, and even then we can never be so sure things aren\u2019t changing at every moment. That\u2019s when we have to choose what to believe, in order to decide how to play the game, and that\u2019s a lot of fun and emotion (think family uno nights and poker). Humans are kick Ass at statistics, and concepts like \u201cEntropy\u201d are just really really powerful ways of expressing our introspection about our learning strategies and the statistics and likelihoods of our environments.

But my (a humans) use of the start words is to give me the best possible chance at revealing as many letters hits as possible and then a human takes over without any additional tools. For this, I calculate the most likely chance of letters hitting. This is my list of letters (most probable to least) [e, a, r, o, t, l, i, s, n, c, u, y, d, h, p, m, g, b, f, k, w, v, z, x, r, j]. Now there are one-word solutions that can give better coverage of the initial letters but that significantly reduces your second-word choices so my calculation balances letters to yield two words that cover the 10 most likely letters. I think humans (or at least my brain) are already biased toward more common words. Anyway, that is my strategy in a nutshell.

Give each letter a rank score for each position - for example, &quot;a&quot; is the 6th most common 1st letter, so &quot;a&quot; gets a &quot;Position 1 Rank Score&quot; of 21 points (26-6+1)<br>4. For each possible word, sum the position rank score of each of it&#39;s 5 letters.<br>5. Guess what the winner is? It&#39;s still CRANE!!! - c=25, R=24, A=26, N=25, E=26 (total=126)<br>6. Actually I lied: CRANE and SAINT tie for the best score of 126.<br>7. Runners-up are BRINE, CEASE, COAST and CRONE which all score 124<br>8. Assuming you get little-to-nothing from the first word, second good words (same method, with no repeated letters anywhere in the word) are:<br>       CRANE, followed by FOIST<br>       SAINT, followed by BOULE or CRUEL<br><br>I like this approach because my meager human brain gets more &quot;information&quot; from greens than yellows.

As such I\u2019ve started deliberately guessing letters which are not the least likely (z,x,q) but letters that are somewhat likely (p,d,h), in hopes that I get a gray or maybe a yellow. This method of eliminating letters is crucial if you play Wordle on hard mode, and helps stop the gears, tears, fears, pears, nears, trap that can make people (and even software) lose. That being said, there was a study out of Cambridge which points out that humans see words as whole entities rather than individual letters. Words are recognized by a first and last letter, but the letters inbetween can be completely jumbled. Therefore if you want to maximize your ability to think of answers it might be valuable to guess the most likely first and last letters, but to guess somewhat unlikely letters in the middle. Anyhow, I thought your video was excellent, and if anything I find the information theory makes Wordle all that much more fun.", "comment_date": "2022-02-19T14:54:04Z", "likes_count": 388}, {"comment_by": "Barry O\u2019Brien", "comment_text": "I\u2019m just gonna stick with crane - typos", "comment_date": "2022-02-19T14:46:03Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Fidel Cashflow", "comment_text": "Notes/Acrid gang, where you at", "comment_date": "2022-02-19T14:29:34Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Nels Anderson", "comment_text": "No, ruining the game is knowing that the source code contains all the Wordle answers in the order with which they appear....

So if I start with &quot;LANCE&quot; and get no hits, I might try something like &quot;SPORT&quot; next.  It has been extremely common to guess by a process of elimination by the third or sometimes fourth guess.  <br><br>Of course, taking this approach requires that you think long and hard to find a possible answer given the clues so far -- you know the right answer has to be a very common word.  And that can be challenging, since it&#39;s not how our brains like to work.  Whenever you find it very hard to think of <b>any</b> word that might fit the clues so far, then you just need to keep trying to think of one until you come up with it and then that will be your next guess, and most of the time, it will be the answer.  You <b>know</b> the answer exists, so don&#39;t make another guess until you figure out what it is by exhaustively imagining every possible combination with the remaining letters.<br><br>If one or more letters turns green, and there are still too many possibilities to guess the answer, then I will omit those if possible from the next guess so as to maximize the information I can gain. But if there are yellow letters, then I will usually try to reuse them in different (and likely) positions in hopes of getting some of them to go green.<br><br>Even at the third guess, if I still have not narrowed it down and can still think of at least 3 possible common-word answers, then I will try to come up with a guess that maximizes the candidate extra letters that can form possible and likely answers, even though this necessarily means that this next guess cannot possibly be the answer.  Then I can be sure to find the answer in only 2 more turns instead of wasting 3 or 4 by swapping out a single letter repeatedly in an effort to guess the right answer.<br><br>Using these techniques, I got my stats for 200 games down to the following:<br>1 guess:  0 times<br>2 guess: 4 times<br>3 guess: 68 times<br>4 guess: 81 times<br>5 guess: 42 times<br>6 guess: 4 times<br>LOST:  1 time (that was early in the sequence, before I got the hang of it)<br><br>But every single variant I&#39;ve found of this game (on web sites) messes up the replicated letter in a guess, and they ALWAYS show out-of-place letters that are in the target as YELLOW, even after all the actual such letters in the target have been accounted for in the guess.  So if the answer has only 1 E but the guess has 2 E&#39;s, they always show both E&#39;s as yellow or maybe one is green.  Very misleading!  So the &quot;bug&quot; mentioned here is actually how every single wordle game I&#39;ve ever played has done its scoring.  And yes, it is OBVIOUSLY a bug!<br><br>Now I think I&#39;ll start with words like CRATE or PLACE and see if I do any better or worse.", "comment_date": "2022-02-16T03:45:33Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "David Learmonth", "comment_text": "I like to start with Entry followed by Audio.

Are we sure that is always the case? Or if that is the case here? Because  I feel like it shouldn&#39;t. The way I see it, some of the information that a letter is giving you could also be, at the same time, be given by the other letter; and the bits of information would overlap, just like when you sum things from two sets that have an overlap and you have to account for it to not count the overlap twice. For example, suppose a dictionary where there were an unusually large amount of words that start with GR and words that start with DL. If you use an opener word that starts with GR, for example, wouldn&#39;t the R\u00b4s color give you less information that it should? For example, if both G and R are green, the G it\u00b4s giving you the full 3 bits of information, but before you look at the R\u00b4s color, you already now the R is already more likely to be green, because the G was green. So, if a green R in second place it\u00b4s 2 bits of information by itself, maybe a green R AFTER a green G only gives you 1 bit of information. This would work the same if both G and R were grey, or if we had used D and L.

God sent his Son, Jesus, to Earth as a perfect sinless sacrifice. To take on all the sins of the world; both past, present, and future sins. Shedding his blood on the cross as a blood atonement for all sins. After dying on the cross, he rose from the dead on the 3rd day and rose to Heaven. To show life after death.

CRANE (1378)<br>Yep, CRANE is just in the list..., and is the first word that finally uses a different 1st letter other than S. And btw at 7th, SOOTY is the first word to use a different 5th letter other than E.<br>Now, we can go one (or 2) steps further than this for a 2nd (and 3rd word) score, based on the 1st word, eliminating all 5 letters used in that word (or 4 in the case of SOOTY).<br>For SLATE as the first word, eliminating S ,L ,A ,T , and E, the highest 2nd word score is CRONY (1255), with BRINY a close 2nd (1252). Btw, Y is used as the best, 5th position letter, in the top 10 of 2nd words. The top 10 2nd word list number scores is CRONY (1255), BRINY (1252), CORNY (1186), IRONY (1091), PRIVY (1085), BOOBY (1084), BOOZY (1080), GRIMY (1080), PHONY(1076), GOODY (1071), MOODY (1063), CURRY (1063).<br>If we then eliminate all letters in both the 1st and 2nd word, for a 3rd word score search. For SLATE/CRONY, the highest 3rd word score is HUMID (592), giving a total score of 3284.

TA is all well and good but I find it truly baffling that all major crypto youtubers just look at pure TA and completely ignore the bigger narrative of why BTC is pumping and why the future outlook might not be as rosy as it seems. It&#39;s kinda irresponsible to ignore the fact that each ETF launch so far has caused a major dump at the peaks of BTC. We were already on shaky footing with historically low volume and almost pure whale pumps, narrowly avoiding a long-term bear market. This is the worst possible time in history to invest as so many don&#39;t back up their crypto assets.
