But not always computable by the matrix exponentation, so you might still want to solve the original differential equation to get to the values. This then come to preference how you do it but all those will contain in some place complex numbers. Your methods might hide them but they were there whgen t hose methods were concieved. So to learn how to solve linear cdifferential equations of order 2 &amp; higher it is customary always use complex numbers and then show how it is sometimes possible to do what you want to do without them if you want. But in the end you might not want to beacause you realise that the moste elegant solutions are the ones with complex numbers and all other methods are more cumbersome. Except the matrix exponentation. It&#39;s there to give a end in your paper where you want to show that there is a valid way to express explicitely your solution.", "comment_date": "2022-08-21T11:05:51Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Topi Linkala", "comment_text": "Another comment on nomenclature: Complex numbers are complex like an apartment complex and not complex like quantumn physics are. Eg. just two numbers attached together, Imaginary numbers are not imagined more than real numbers are and real numbers are not real. So Real and Imaginary are just complement words used by mathematicians to label these two as unreal  sets of numbers so that you know which set you speak. And don&#39;t get me wrong as I&#39;m a mathematician myself. It is just philosophical point and a fact that you should not read into the names of these sets. So, when learning about these things keep in mind that they are just tools to do mathematics. So there is nothing complex about complex numbers and imaginary numbers are as real as you want them to be.", "comment_date": "2022-08-21T07:11:58Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "T M", "comment_text": "I like \u201cLateral numbers\u201d for imaginary numbers", "comment_date": "2022-08-17T18:31:29Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Sebastian Delgado", "comment_text": "Thanks so much, you make me fall a little more in love with math every day", "comment_date": "2022-08-13T07:14:45Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "curious cat", "comment_text": "Anyone watching this at 2am as me \ud83d\ude09\u270c?", "comment_date": "2022-08-07T17:33:30Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Icen Arsin", "comment_text": "I wish you were my high school math teacher", "comment_date": "2022-08-06T05:04:33Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "V\u0451da\u043fg", "comment_text": "I&#39;ve a confusion about squre roots and i.<br>Ala i know, \u221ax^2 = x, x &gt; 0, and that&#39;s why we say \u221ax^2 = |x|.

After bitcoin reached these highs, the cryptocurrency\u2019s uptrend stalled, with the past few days mainly consisting of consolidation as altcoins begin gaining some momentum once again. This uptrend\u2019s strength seems to indicate that the entire market could be well-positioned to see continuation in the mid-term. However, many analysts still believe that Bitcoin and other major altcoins will post a sizeable correction in the near-term. So we might witness some little correction on the price of bitcoin before 2O21.

When and how we conceptualize and learn about them is a large part of the answer, IMO.  We aren&#39;t introduced to 2-D grids (geospatial math concepts of X-Y coordinates) until after we study arithmetic (counting, addition, subtraction, multiplication, powers, and exponents; basics of numbers); about the time we start learning about algebra (variable manipulation and properties).  Complex numbers are only introduced later when we start investigating a negative number to a power of a non integer.  Function theory has typically been introduced by that point and a belief in determinism is setting in.  I&#39;d point out that in a way, complex numbers bridge the gap between X-Y coordinate systems and trigonometry (although trig is normally when the intersection starts.  Complex numbers just takes it a step further).  My point, I liked how you segwayed to What should the complex numbers be called (rotational numbers -sneaky numbers) and the discussion around the physics i, j, k or geospatial x,y,z (3-D).  Complex numbers focus on rotation in a deep way a lot of trig does not, although polar rectangular transformations are a thing that is glanced over.<br><br>If you consider a number to be real, Which is real?  Which exists?  <br>2     2^.5     (-1)^.5     infinity<br>Numbers aren&#39;t real in the sense that objects are real.  Count are more attributes of how we conceptualize and quantify objects.  Integers are a more obvious manifestation of objects that people have an easy time agreeing on how the system is defined.  Irrational numbers with non finite values, that can only be approached with limit, feels less real.  Same with imaginary numbers.  Infinity is such a high level concept that I hesitate to even consider it a number.  A numerical concept, sure, I can get behind that.  His concession that a application makes numbers real is interesting.  &quot;As real as words are.&quot;  That is a good point.  Happiness feel conceptually as vague as infinity.  Just saying.<br><br>The multi dimensionality of complex numbers (and X-Y coordinate systems) and the information that extra dimensionality is what makes the system so interesting.  It feels orthogonal, not linearly independent.  Or as you said, a number can have multiple dimensions.  From the power grid perspective, it allows concepts to move from the time domain to the frequency domain.  The multi dimensionality, in a sense, allows us to freeze time.  It allows for a transformation of concept (time to frequency domains in this case).  Reactive power doesn&#39;t exist as an instantaneous quantity.  MVAr is a unit or measure of parasitic effects of energy storage devices.  It has impacts on how you evaluate the health, performance, and analysis, but it is not real in the same way that real power is real.<br><br>Renee Decarte coined these as derogatory to make fun of the &quot;imaginary&quot; component.  I&#39;d never heard that.<br><br>Even vector calculus is used in complex numbers, at least the vector part.  Interesting how X-Y coordinates seldom reference vectors.

When a light is 60 kW bulb,  that is an average of the 120Hz power usage where currents and voltages are at 60 Hz.  This is the such that makes math mumbo jumbo feel real.

Like riding a bike, once you see it again, your like, &quot;OH&quot; then it&#39;s al normal again. Math is like that... but first you need to learn to ride.<br><br>Since math is a language it should be taught as; or at least have a simple review system.<br><br>Here are the things I need if its possible for even other commenters or a future video, or if someone knows of a video to let me know.<br><br>Its the operations of factoring, the multitude of ways of breaking down x squared thignswithout using quadratic formula, we were taught so many ways, a binary way, a factoring method, etc... Other fundamentals... in which I am sure I wasn&#39;t taught. Basically short hand method of coming to the same answer as the symbol is integrating a meaning. The meaning is where the problem lies...<br><br>Math and english are pretty much identical in their resolve, even poetic math... SO like, ... Adding.... is denoted as a plus or positive number relation, multiplication is denoted as parentheses or an x (tilted plus; or a central dot) we take these often terms but it is a math slang or bad grammar. Maybe Math in how its taught should have a re-ordered look of the symbols of use for it so their is less ambiguity and more clarity and better retention and movement from class of grades, as new symbols of slang math causes problems when we suddenly are taught one thing of the langaugeand then suddenly for the purposes of speed we don&#39;t put in the grammar at all. So yeah... multiplication is a symbol of adding a multitude of numbers like in order..  Exponents nan geometric sequences, and probability... etc... but... to me, more often we use english tho confuse math and thus creates more problems unless one has a command of english as well.. (bit ranty here) So like counter clockwise.. or clockwise, or widdershins... these terms are meaning and must be taught, where they could be denoted by a symbol of express for direction, which is better then using the english term. Keeping math universal in the symbols of denotation will give arise to further clarity... Since one person could be brilliant at math ,but fail to understand the english written problem.<br><br>I am looking for all the methods of  patterns na association for math and shortcuts, like Khans maths. Which who knows why its called that since it was not that guy, but whatever, lol.  Just the tools of math, like why we havechoosen, BEdmas, or foil. .WHy do we do multiplication first over adding.  Or foil... I know why, we do multiplication first, because it has ghost brackets around it that we no longer write ( slang math grammar) because its set of numbers added in success x terms) the the product of that is added to the + .. I (4+5*3) is really (4+(5x3)) which is really (4+5+5+5), so symbols create sub terms of meaning to create faster ways of adding and subtracting. Thus we use them as such. So taking unknowns and questions can be write-in what i would call grammar correct math, which is long hand way of writing it out in the terms of adding and subtracting as the basis to what the question is asked. Which relates back to how in the 1750&#39;s*.. century we calculated the shape of the earth before sats. <br><br>Help is always appreciated...", "comment_date": "2020-11-23T18:59:46Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Patricia McGeorge", "comment_text": "Can we get a video explaining the practical differences between vectors and complex numbers and why they&#39;re not the same?", "comment_date": "2020-11-23T01:25:27Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Przemys\u0142aw Starczynowski", "comment_text": "Great video, entire channel actually, helps a lot for your maths to sink in.

I challenge you to show me something with a length of i cm.<br>As to their application, I&#39;m well aware that in electrical engineering for example &quot;AC voltage is real and current is imaginary&quot;, however that&#39;s can easily be interpreted as a shorthand for modeling how inductance/capacitance causes phase shift while resistance changes magnitude.<br>In practice, oscilloscope outputs are very much real, an i (or j in this case) is multiplied on because that&#39;s how the equation works.<br><br>We use plenty of mathematical tools.

The Schrodinger equation (describing the time-evolution of the wave function of a particle) relies intrinsically on complex numbers in a way most physics doesn&#39;t. Most people that deal with complex numbers in an introductory physics setting encounter them as a handy tool for dealing with electromagnetic signals and systems.<br><br>A very common place you might see this is when engineers express current and voltage using complex numbers (particularly phasors) as a way of handling differences in phase of the signal representing voltage and the signal representing current. If you have a circuit with a voltage source (AC), and a resistor and a capacitor in series, both of those can be represented using impedances. In that simple case, the impedance of the resistor is a pure real number (R) and the impedance of the capacitor is a pure imaginary number ( -j/Cs). So the total circuit has a voltage-current relationship like V=ZI, where Z=R-j/Cs and V and I are expressed as phasors.<br><br>In this case, the use of phasors and complex numbers is a useful fiction, as everything CAN be expressed using differential equations without resorting to any imaginary components. In the dynamics of a wavefunction, however, we have i*hbar*dpsi/dt = H*psi. In the one dimensional case, assuming low speeds, H*psi is usually written as V(x,t)*psi - hbar/2m* d^2 psi/dx^2.<br><br>If you look at that right-hand side, hbar is a real number expressing quantization of energy, m is the (real number) mass of the particle, and V is the (also real number) potential energy. If the wavefunction (psi) is real, then so is its second derivative, and hbar, and 2m and V... so the whole of H*psi is real. If you now look at the left, we have the (real) hbar, and the real number time derivative of psi... but we have that multiplied by i. So an imaginary number (i*hbar*dpsi/dt) is somehow supposed to equal a real number (H*psi). Fundamentally, the dynamics of wavefunctions demand that they are complex-valued, as otherwise the only solution to their equations of evolution would be if they were for all time and space equal to 0. (0i = 0+0i = 0)<br><br>For most of the places complex numbers are used, yes they are simply a useful way of organizing quantites related in some sense by rotation or to represent factors of irreducible quadratics. In the physics of the atomic scales, however, complex numbers are indeed necessary to correctly formulate how particles behave.", "comment_date": "2020-05-02T03:44:32Z", "likes_count": 2}, {"comment_by": "Carl Hansen", "comment_text": "I like Gauss&#39;s solution to renaming imaginary numbers.

There is one aspect of mathematics that would almost be impossible to work with without the use of complex numbers or the complex plane and that is when you are working with Laplace Transforms. Even FFTs (Fast Fourier Transforms) which is s special case of Laplace Transforms can, in theory, be done without complex numbers and the complex plane but good luck with that! With the properties of the Laplace Transforms, it makes life a lot easier when trying to solve for extremely complex Integrals and Differentials. One of the biggest fields that this will show up in is Engineering. Maybe not every branch of Engineering but many of them. In most cases, you&#39;ll see these in Electrical Engineering, Systems and Controls, and many other fields. Basically, anytime you have complex data sets and complex algorithms that involve rotations of any kind or wave functions in particular that have a phase, these will show up and they come in very handy. It might be hard to grasp or understand Laplace Transforms at first, but if you start to use them to solve equations, it becomes easier and the intuition of what&#39;s happening within the data set becomes more clear.", "comment_date": "2020-04-29T05:07:41Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Bearz314", "comment_text": "&quot;apologies for being mildly scattered throughou-&quot;<br>Wow, the last part is butchered too xD Good lecture though!", "comment_date": "2020-04-29T04:48:34Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "skilz8098", "comment_text": "Well at about <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5PcpBw5Hbwo&amp;t=52m00s\">52:00</a> in the video instead of using the complex form, the identities are fairly easy.

We can worry about the sign of the terms later.<br><br><br>First observation \u2014 cos(a+b) is symmetrical in a and b (reversing the roles of a and b doesn&#39;t change the answer), and so f(a)g(b) is symmetrical iff h(a)j(b) is. WLOG, this indicates that if f = g, then h = j; if f \u2260 g, then h \u2260 j. So, we are able to reduce the problem to two general cases: cos(a+b) = \u00b1f(a)f(b) \u00b1 g(a)g(b) and cos(a+b) = \u00b1f(a)g(b) \u00b1 g(a)f(b), where f,g \u2208 {sin, cos}. (The same goes for sin(a+b).)<br><br><br>Second observation \u2014 cos(a+b) is an even function, so the expression equalling that must also be an even function. This discounts cos(a+b) = \u00b1sin(a)cos(b) \u00b1 cos(a)sin(b) because cos(-(a+b)) = \u00b1sin(-a)cos(-b) \u00b1 cos(-a)sin(-b) = -[\u00b1sin(a)cos(b) \u00b1 cos(a)sin(b)] = -cos(a+b), which is impossible, so cos(a+b) = \u00b1f(a)f(b) \u00b1 g(a)g(b).<br><br><br>Third observation \u2014 cos(a+0) = cos(a), so cos(a+0) = \u00b1f(a)f(0) \u00b1 g(a)g(0), and we can only assure identity if f = cos and g = sin. Furthermore, the first \u00b1 can&#39;t be -, so it must be +.<br><br><br>Forth observation \u2014 when a = b = \u03c0/4, cos(a+b) = cos(\u03c0/2) = 0, so cos(a)cos(a) = \u00b1sin(a)sin(a), but sin(\u03c0/4) = cos(\u03c0/4) = \u221a[1/2] &gt; 0, so cos(\u03c0/4)cos(\u03c0/4) = sin(\u03c0/4)sin(\u03c0/4), so cos(a+b) = cos(a)cos(b) - sin(a)sin(b).<br><br><br>For sin(a+b), the first observation reduces us to one of \u00b1f(a)f(b) \u00b1 g(a)g(b) or \u00b1f(a)g(b) \u00b1 g(a)f(b), as in cos(a+b). We use the observation that sin(a+b) is odd to reject the possibility of \u00b1f(a)f(b) \u00b1 g(a)g(b) because both sin(a)sin(b) and cos(a)cos(b) are even under the transformation a,b \u21a6 -a,-b, and no sum or difference of such functions is odd under a+b \u21a6 -(a+b), and also immediately gives us that f\u2260g, so sin(a+b) = \u00b1sin(a)cos(b) \u00b1 sin(b)cos(a). Symmetry again gives us sin(a+b) = \u00b1(sin(a)cos(b)+sin(b)cos(a)), and sin(a+0) = sin(a) gives us sin(a+b) = sin(a)cos(b) + sin(b)cos(a).<br><br><br>I didn&#39;t need complex numbers to remember this, but complex numbers are easier to conceptualize.", "comment_date": "2020-04-29T00:46:08Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Francisco Domingo", "comment_text": "que tipazo es grant", "comment_date": "2020-04-29T00:18:50Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Diego Pablo Gordillo Varas", "comment_text": "I can&#39;t believe how many times I&#39;ve studied complex numbers, and I&#39;ve never realized why i^2 NEEDS to be -1.<br>I thought it was a lucky definition that somehow turned out fine...<br>So... thank you.

Awesome videos, even watching them later, thank you! Watching this something struck my mind. We define the complex plain by defining the unit of the new dimension as the square root of a number from the original dimension. Even though -1 in this respect is a natural choice it still feels a bit special and generalizable. For example, what kind of numbers or plain we get if we choose the square root of 2 as the unit, or the square root of an arbitrary real number r? This creates a function like relationship between the two dimension. I was wondering what are the features of the complex numbers that are resulting from this function like relationship.

Number systems consists of data structures and operations. Unfortunately, number systems are often designed (at least by syntax and notation) in a way that kind of hides this fact and make it look as if it was only a set of numbers.<br><br>The actual data structure of complex numbers is very simple. It&#39;s 2-dimensional numbers. This is the same data structure as in another number system, 2d vectors. It only differs in the available operations.<br>The main operations are:<br>* component-wise addition (same as in 2d-vectors, so not much to talk about)<br>* RotateAndScale<br>RotateAndScale takes two arguments: The original point and another point which defines the angle of rotation and the scaling factor. The result of the operation is a new 2d point. How an angle of rotation and scaling factor can be defined by a 2d point is explained in the video. One interesting fact from this is that the rotation is given by the angle between (1, 0), (0, 0) and one of the points. Note that this gives one dimension a special meaning because angles are measured towards the horizontal axis and not the vertical one.<br><br>That&#39;s basically all you need to know, but now comes the confusing part: Syntax and naming.<br><br>Lets start with naming: <br><br>The numbers are called &quot;complex numbers&quot;, and that&#39;s a fitting name because it&#39;s a complex of two numbers. Here &quot;complex&quot; has the same meaning as &quot;composition&quot; and is not meant as the opposite of simple. But every other 2d point is also a complex of two numbers. We already have at least two names for this: 2d point and 2d vector. There&#39;s nothing different to justify a new name. Naming not the numbers but the number system &quot;Complex number system&quot; would be better, but that has it&#39;s own problems I&#39;m not going into the details here.<br><br>The components of the 2d point are called &quot;real part&quot; and &quot;imaginary part&quot;. Tbh, this is just confusing and does not add much benefit. The only important point is to know which part is on the axis towards which rotations are measured (see above) so giving the dimensions different names kind of has a purpose. Otherwise, calling it x and y component would work just as fine. Or use the names of the domain in which it is applied, e.g. if you want to use it to describe the relation between the potential and the kinetic energy of a pendulum, one component is called  the potential energy and the other is the kinetic energy. Both have the same unit in this example, but can be different in other examples. One problem I have seen over and over again when complex numbers are applied to real world problems is that the &quot;imaginary&quot; axis is thought of to be abstract anyway, so no unit is given and no name is given to say which part of the real world it describes. Even worse: It hides the fact that you have to start in a 2d domain to even be able to apply it. People don&#39;t know when it&#39;s ok to use complex numbers as a result and when the right answer would be that no solution exists just because they don&#39;t know if they operate on one- or two-dimensional data.<br><br>Syntax/notation:<br>Complex numbers are written like this: &quot;a + bi&quot;. It&#39;s just the point (a, b), but less obvious that it&#39;s a point. And looks even more confusing when your axis have different units like this: 2m + 3Joule * i.<br><br>Syntax of RotateAndScale:<br>RotateAndScale is just a function, so the obvious way would be to write it as <br>newPoint = RotateAndScale(startPoint, pointDefiningTheRotationAndScaling) <br>or<br>c_new = RotateAndScale(c1, c2)<br>or<br>(x_new, y_new) = RotateAndScale((x1, y1), (x2, y2))<br>But it&#39;s actually written with the same operator symbol as the multiplication:<br>c_new = c1 * c2<br>or<br>a_new + b_new * i = (a1 + b1 * i) (a2 + b2 * i)<br>Be careful. It has the same symbol, and it shares some properties (it&#39;s distributive etc.) but It&#39;s still a different operation! The only way to know which actual operation is meant is to look at the arguments. If one of the arguments is a complex number, it&#39;s not just a multiplication. If both arguments are not complex numbers, well you have to guess. Unfortunately, you can&#39;t tell if it&#39;s actually a non-complex number because  the notation for a 2d point (a, 0) is the same as for a 1d point a. That&#39;s because the &quot;+0i&quot; part in &quot;a +0i&quot; is defined as optional. It doesn&#39;t always make a difference in the result, because RotateAndScale with (a, 0) doesn&#39;t rotate and is just scaling (or multiplying) by a.  a1*a2 and  (a1+0i) * (a2 +0i) do not have the same result (because one is one-dimensional and the other is two-dimensional) but both results have the same notation, so it doesn&#39;t matter. Both are just written as whatever a1*a2 is.<br><br>So if the results are the same, why bother with which operation it actually is at all? Because there are cases where the results are not the same. When you want to know which number y multiplied by itself is a given value x, you write it as y=sqrt(x). Well, imagine the actually symbol for square root which I just can&#39;t input here in the text. For complex numbers, the same notation is taken for a similar but different question: Which 2d point c1 rotated and scaled by c1 is c2? Notated as c1=sqrt(c2). The difference is that only one of those has a solution for negative numbers. If for example you have a real life problem where you have to take the square root of -2, there are two possible answers. First: You have a one-dimensional problem and it doesn&#39;t have a solution. Or second: Your actual problem is not taking the square root of -2, but the &quot;square root&quot; of (-2, 0) or -2+0i. And the solution is a 2d point that describes a rotation by a right angle and some scaling.<br>That means that:<br>* There is an actual second dimension involved in your problem<br>* That dimension can be named and has a unit<br>* Your input was a 2d point all along but you didn&#39;t notice<br>* Your mutiplications actually were RotateAndScale -operations all along<br>* Rotation could be applied in a way that makes sense because the values of the dimensions are somehow linked. Like the potential and kinetic energy in the example above which are linked because they can be transformed into each other. The rotation transforms values of one dimension into values of the other dimension. There must be a real life reason why they can be transformed, e.g. a physical law.<br>* The dimensions are scaled in a way that the rotation makes sense. In the above example, measuring kinetic energy in joule and potential energy in calories wouldn&#39;t give you a nice one to one transformation and therefore the rotation wouldn&#39;t make much sense (without more math to fix it)<br><br>All these points are giving you insight into your actual problem.

If you compare the angles and the distance between vector of  (1,0) whit the vector Z, and then multiply both by (c+di) they maintain the same angles and relative distance because they underwent the same transformations (stretching about 0, rotating 90\u00b0 about 0, and translation) and the same applies for for any complex number.", "comment_date": "2020-04-25T07:58:04Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "scott hamilton", "comment_text": "Great lecture.

Several of your videos use complex numbers to explore some concept or another, and there&#39;s always this assumption that the viewer is familiar with them (never stopped me from watching them anyway). Having never formally learned about them, I had this vague idea of what they were, but now I actually feel like I know enough that I can go back to those videos and get something new out of them. \r<br>\r<br>When I was trying to memorize the trig identities for my calc exam, I looked up methods to remember them, and the only thing I got was &quot;rederive them using complex numbers&quot; which was very unhelpful, since I had no idea that trigonometry had anything to do with complex numbers. It&#39;s cool to see how they actually connect in a really fundamental way, and where the identities come from, instead of the teacher going &quot;here&#39;s an identity I just pulled out of my ass, now memorize it&quot;. I&#39;m very excited to learn about how this all ties into exponential formulas and what Euler&#39;s identity is.\r<br>\r<br>Sorry for the long comment, I&#39;m just really glad to finally actually learn what the hell is up with complex numbers after all these years of people talking about them without explaining them.
