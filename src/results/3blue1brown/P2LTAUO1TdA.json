One way is as a linear transformation operator which moves a vector in standard basis to another vector in standard basis. Visually, this is what the previous videos have been showing, that the grid stays the same while the vector moves. The second way is as a change of basis operator, where the vector does not move, but the grid changes. <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P2LTAUO1TdA&amp;t=11m00s\">11:00</a> requires both views to make sense, and an understanding that the rightmost vector of [-1,2] is not in terms of the usual standard basis, but starting from jennifer&#39;s basis.<br><br>To further strengthen the 2 views understanding above, another thing to note was that <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P2LTAUO1TdA&amp;t=7m48s\">7:48</a> treated the inverse matrix transform as moving from jennifer&#39;s basis back to standard basis, with the visualization showing the grid rotating back.(2nd view in previous paragraph). If we didn&#39;t know this matrix was the inverse of a previous transformation, and simply seen it as any other 2x2 transform, the animation would then be starting from the standard grid and rotating it rightwards, with a [3,2] vector becoming [5/3,1/3]. This shows that [5/3, 1/3] can be seen in 2 ways. First way is as the scalars that scale jennifer&#39;s basis vectors to create a [3,2] in the standard grid. Second way is as the new vector that is created when transforming the [3,2] onto 2 new basis vectors [1/3,-1/3] and [1/3,2/3].

So, in &quot;her grid&quot;, V is the combination of 2 basis b1 = [1,0] and b2 = [0,1]. Then, if we transform the basis to see V*, the vector V shown in our coordinate = &quot;our grid&quot;, b1 and b2 are turned into [2,1] and [-1,1]. So the matrix (=transformation) turn V into V*, and it means the matrix translate &quot;her grid&quot; to &quot;our grid&quot;. Well, I might be wrong because I see the grid as perspective.

Implying that the vector will scale up or down and very possibly change direction too - yielding a vector with new physical coordinates.

It does if we stay on Jenifer&#39;s grid or think of the product in Jenifer&#39;s language. \r<br>\r<br>A concept I found helpful for my understanding this multiplication example and reconciling what happens to the the vector after the multiplication is that when the change of basis matrix and vector are multiplied, our grid perspective has to change from Jenifer&#39;s grid to our grid to see and confirm that the vector has not transformed in space at all. It is the same vector, first described in Jenifer&#39;s language, then described in our language by virtue of multiplication with the change of basis matrix.

I mean it could be anything else just generally people think in that ortogonal coordinate system (what i want to mean is the independency and how we think of dimensions, so i would introduce angles too in this video). So the real thing is, for me there&#39;s a missing part in the video that would describe further how exactly should we (or could we) think of basises in the therms of why the matrix of basis change naturally outputs the vector in the ortogonal basis if you input for example Jennifer&#39;s vector cause if we set another basis as default &quot;ours&quot; than its not trivial at all. As a starting point (to make sure you understand what i mean) i would only take a blank black screen and pretend its a plane, then i would display some vectors, then add basises to the picture.
