In the A(BC) example, first you get a new D matrix from applying B to C ( D = BC ), then get a result (R) by applying A to D  ( R = AD ). The same way in the (AB)C example, first you apply A to B then get E matrix ( E = AB ), then get a result by applying E to C ( R = EC ). Notice that you never apply a matrix on the right to the matrix on the left no matter how far from each other they stand. For example neither C is being applied to composition that includes B or A, nor the B is being applied to A. This leads to A(BC) = (AB)C.

If you multiply the two matrices you have like this: M1 * M2, write the first matrix in the lower left and the second in the upper right quadrant. The quadrant in the lower right will then hold the product of M1 * M2.<br><br>For each cell, select the row in M1 and the colloumn in M2 that would get you to that cell (picture the product as a coordinate system, with the collumns of M2 being the x-coordinate and the rows of M1 being the y-coordinate), and start counting at 1. Multiply the n-th cell in whatever row you have selected in M1 with the n-th cell in whatever colloumn you have selected in M2. The increment your imaginary counter, and repeat the process. (n is whatever number you are counting at right now). Add all the products together, and that sum is what goes into the cell.<br><br>I like that schema because it gives a very nice visual way to see how you multiply any two matrices together, and it even shows you when you have messed up, namely when the number of collumns of M1 and the rows of M2 are not the same, because then the schema doesn&#39;t work (which is exactly when a product for the two matrices is not defined)<br><br>I will draw a more visual way of demonstrating Falk&#39;s Schema if I can", "comment_date": "2021-12-11T09:24:20Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Mohit Pandey", "comment_text": "I am the only indian here in comment section \ud83d\ude02", "comment_date": "2021-11-28T14:30:22Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Imad Uddin", "comment_text": "This video is incredibly good!", "comment_date": "2021-11-27T19:12:18Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Deniz T\u00fcrk", "comment_text": "I don&#39;t really know how to thanks!", "comment_date": "2021-11-27T14:55:25Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Annisa", "comment_text": "I was stuck in my machine learning preliminary lessons but this series helped me to think of matrices in a different and intuitive way.

So, ABC can be thought of as the composition a(b(c(x))). Now we can see that if we were to define some other function, q, as the composition of a and b, i.e., q(x) = a(b(x)), then a(b(c(x))) = q(c(x)). Likewise, we could define a function z that is the composition of b and c, i.e., z(x) = b(c(x)), so a(b(c(x))) = a(z(x)). So, q(c(x)) = a(z(x)), and this is pretty much the same as saying (AB)C = A(BC), I think...

Matrices and determinants here are being brought in from THE VERY BEGINNING, when their essence, namely the linear transformations they represent are being introduced all the way at the page 107, and I am not even sure if matrices and manipulations with them are being re-formulated in terms of, once again, linear transformations. Like come on, there is this definition of matrix multiplication: <br><br><i>The multiplication of matrices A with orders m &amp; n, and a matrix B with orders n &amp; p is to output a certain matrix C with orders m &amp; p (following with a formula to compute the elements of C)</i> .<br><br>I am just really curious how many students actually understood this definition the first time they read it - I did not. But when I started thinking about transformations and their compositions I finally understood the whole thing with orders! Namely if we apply a transformation, which maps vectors in p dimensions into n dimensions, and then we apply a transformation which maps vectors in n dimensions to m dimensions, you get a transformation which maps vectors in p dimensions to m dimensions.

I was a little confused until I figured out that what you were saying was the semantics of the expression resulted in the same sequence of transformations regardless of how the parenthesis were placed.  That&#39;s all well and good, but I was curious if the associativity held if the <b>actual</b> sequence of operations was altered in accordance with the parenthesis.  So I did as you advised and played around with it a little bit. I just used the matrix multiplication algorithm mechanically without regard to the transformation concept and did it in both possible sequences to see if it got the same result.  It was, as you alluded to from your earlier school experience, messy.  But I am pleased to report that it did.  Associativity holds regardless of the sequence of operations.

I watched this series out to interest for the first time and not only was it educative, but also entertaining in  certain way. Now I am at uni and taking matrix algebra for the first time. It is called like this for a reason: Nearly ALL of the geometric insight presented in this series is omitted, and matrix multiplication is taught even before the class was introduced to the concept of a linear transformation. For people like me, whose studies involve mathematics on a marginal level, this series gives an extraordinary level of understanding and in fact, I am still multiplying matrices in the way presented in this video (since it makes so much intutive sense) as opposed to using the algorithm presented to us in lectures. It is really quite frustrating to see how academics can gloss over the &quot;essence of linear algebra&quot; completely when teaching it. <br><br>(I am reading biological sciences at the University of Cambridge, and matrices are taught to us mostly as a tool in statistics which is important in life sciences. I am sure that in fields more in line with maths, the educators of the univeristy do focus more on the concepts presented here and can make learning linear algebra just as pleasant as it was for me by watching the series. However, I still think that that the geometric meaning of matrices is a must learn for anyone who tries their hand at linear algebra regardless of the broader field of study.)", "comment_date": "2017-10-30T12:21:14Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "gopal shaurya", "comment_text": "just suberb..!.. tnks... :)", "comment_date": "2017-10-29T10:33:05Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "GaboSouls", "comment_text": "the spanish subtitles are in disphase :( i love this serie! &lt;3", "comment_date": "2017-10-29T03:21:26Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Pro Odermonicon", "comment_text": "<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XkY2DOUCWMU&amp;t=4m25s\">4:25</a> Good news for arabic readers!", "comment_date": "2017-10-29T02:53:51Z", "likes_count": 6}, {"comment_by": "Jorge Monteiro", "comment_text": "Great video!", "comment_date": "2017-10-21T21:44:27Z", "likes_count": 2}, {"comment_by": "Raviraja Mylavarapu", "comment_text": "Awesome!!!!", "comment_date": "2017-10-20T06:43:56Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Eric Bahr", "comment_text": "These are some pretty godamnded good videos, man.
