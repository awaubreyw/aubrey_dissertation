According to this attempt I looked, beside a lot of other math videos a mathologer vid about the Euler product. It was pretty easy to understand, it was really a good video and so I think most people did. But the most important thing to proof that a infinite product of linear factors with the same distance is not only an approximation of a circle function, it is indeed a circle function was not done. Consequently I did some research and found out that the common way to do this is checking holomorphism. Ok, a function that you can dev complex is holomorphic, but what does this mean?? I got no idea. Dev complex and holomorphism seems to my kind of grasp a very powerful tool and a good topic for a vid to push the knowledge of math to a more prolific level.", "comment_date": "2022-05-07T19:59:34Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "\uae40\uc740\uc601", "comment_text": "Until ~B to OPEN <br>HIDEN  PROVE  OF <br>JESUS", "comment_date": "2022-05-03T00:11:33Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "pokeymaker", "comment_text": "There is just one thing I don&#39;t get, maybe someone can explain it to me.<br>He said that multiplying by i (which is 1i) is turning the plane from i by a quarter of a circle (90 degrees).

It&#39;s based on defining a general notion of what iterating to imaginary powers means (so you don&#39;t have to just accept that e^x is a mapper between two specialized sorts of number and instead just continue with the intuitive definition of exponentiation as iterated multiplication), idea requires just a basic understanding of principles of calculus (though the complete proof requires knowing e^x is it&#39;s own derivative to proof it&#39;s the particular base that works for the equation), and the rest of it is just geometry. The basic is idea is that any iterated function traces out as orbital as you raise it to a real power, and changing the function being iterated changes these orbits. The change raising to real power does is just to amplify the derivative of the orbital, and raising to a complex power is essentially the same, it just requires rotating the derivative of the orbital field as well. The key thing iterated multiplication makes rays as orbitals, so imaginary iterated orbitals forms concentric circles. The base of exponentiation is one, so that means the path of imaginary exponentiation will be from one along the circle around the origin passing through one. There is pi length path to get from 1 to -1 along that path, and when the base is e and the distance stays at one from the origin no other factors have to be multiplied in as the magnitude of the derivative stays at one, and that completes the proof.", "comment_date": "2017-12-14T07:41:39Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Alienrookie", "comment_text": "Should have explained the Taylor part...", "comment_date": "2017-12-13T17:37:22Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Jitendra Singh Rawat", "comment_text": "why are values taken in radians, not in the degree or if this equation is true with replacing pi to 180?", "comment_date": "2017-12-11T17:09:08Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Mattia Improta", "comment_text": "Why like this????<br>e like just a complex number!<br>e^(pi*i) is just di angle pi in the gauss plane!

The question I had initially watching this video is... why? This is only muddled by the fact that the &quot;defining&quot; property of e, e^(x+y)=(e^x)(e^y) (and implying that there is something special about e), is in fact just a defining property of any exponential. You later clear this up somewhat by mentioning that all other exponentials satisfy this, but as a result it is hard to see why e is in any way special in regards to this definition. <br><br>For those wondering, the reason why e is special is answered in his second video, and has to do with e^x being its own derivative: &quot;When we zoom in on e^x taking the point associated with a particular adder, to the point associated with some multiplier, it resembles that very multiplier as it does so.&quot; The importance of this point is further examined in the comment section:<br><br>&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;<br>Baumgarten Ralph:<br>then all of the exponential functions 2^x, 3^x, i^x etc can be derived by the defining property of f(x+y)=f(x)f(y); and does that mean 2^i\u03c0,3^i\u03c0,i^i\u03c0,... all equals respectively to -1? cause those functions will also convert adder to multiplier..then why e-specially e?<br><br>3Blue1Brown:<br>Good question, I did not emphasize this point well enough.  All those other exponentials still draw circles when you raise them to an imaginary power, it&#39;s just that they do so at different rates.  This means i\u03c0 might not get mapped exactly halfway around the circle, but would instead map to some other point on the circle.<br><br>The main point I wanted to make in the previous video was that the property f(x+y)=f(x)f(y) can give an intuitive feel for why raising something to an imaginary power would draw circles at all.  In this video, I wanted to show why of all the functions that satisfy this property, the reason e^x draws the circle so naturally (meaning at a unit rate) is because it is its own derivative (whereas the other functions like 2^x, 3^x, etc. are all merely proportional to their own derivative).&quot;<br>&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;<br>tl;dr: e is special because it draws the circle at the unit rate (e^(i\u03c0) = cos(\u03c0) = -1, ie \u03c0 up the complex plane is only one half turn with base e).", "comment_date": "2016-09-11T01:42:57Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "\u0648\u0644\u062f \u0639\u0628\u0633", "comment_text": "you say we should look at addition and multiplication differently<br>is this view similar to transformations<br>when you add you shift the graph<br>and when you multiply you reflect or stretch the graph?<br>and what books explains this way of looking at math in depth?<br><br>your videos are brilliant<br>thank you very much", "comment_date": "2016-09-08T20:30:16Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Juliana Mendes", "comment_text": "you&#39;re amazing for making these videos, thanks!", "comment_date": "2016-09-06T19:59:36Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "D", "comment_text": "Great video.

However, I still cannot grasp the idea of &quot;e^x&quot; turning an &quot;adder&quot; into a &quot;multiplier&quot;.  Following the idea of operation as actions (shifting or scaling) perform to the real line, I would intuitively think that turning one action into another means that, once applied to a number they would yield the same result. This is not the case of e^x.  Since adding 2 is not the same as multiplying by e^2. I understand you meant something different, e^x is a function that fulfills a very particular property. f(x+y)=f(x)*f(y). Here it is clear that a sum was tuned into a multiplication, but it is still very confusing in terms of what it means to apply e^x  as an action of shifting, scaling or something else to the real line. I must admit that after this point I am lost. Once you generalize these concepts for the real plane, I find it very hard to understand how e^x works in the plane, even though I really like how you explain how multiplication and addition work for complex numbers.  Actually, your video helped me to finally visualize i as something very real and not an artifact, created to work with sqrt(-1).

Then applying this to the 2-D plane. A 2-D plane is just two number lines perpendicular to each other. If he&#39;s working in the Cartesian plane (x,y) adders would move the plane right/left or up/down and multipliers would stretch the plane. At <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_0yfvm0UoU&amp;t=4m06s\">4:06</a> I felt his logic stayed intact. He put in a 1 adder to the y and a 2 adder to the x. But then at <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_0yfvm0UoU&amp;t=4m12s\">4:12</a> he adds a rotation property to multiplying. He multiplied the point (2,0) by some numbers in order to get (4,2). I find this weird. Even if you stretched the plane while keeping things evenly spaced (if you stretched in the x direction only the vertical lines move and if you stretch in the y direction only the horizontal lines move) I don&#39;t know how you would reach the point (4,2) from (2,0). Only by adding the rotation property is this possible which to me doesn&#39;t make intuitive sense with his number line analogy. If instead you think about the point (4,2) not as a point in the Cartesian plane but as a vector magnitude root(20). Root(20) is your multiplier to 1. Although there is a infinite amount of points that are root(20) distance from the origin in a perfect circle. So if root(20) is my multiplier how do I know how much to rotate it to arrive at the point (4,2). I feel in order to satisfy the graphical representation at <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_0yfvm0UoU&amp;t=4m12s\">4:12</a> you would need not only the multiplier root(20) but also an angle in order to define it properly. He later provides that this rotation is defined by i. This concept is really what I came here to understand more. Although after re-inventing addition and multiplication and explaining them thoroughly he just adds this rotation in without really explaining it. This makes sense if you know euler&#39;s formula although this does not help explain euler&#39;s formula itself. <br><br>I feel the only way to fully explain the formula is to look at it numerically in the conventional way. e^x, sin(x), and cos(x) are defined by similar infinite series. When the e^(x) includes &#39;i&#39; which is e^(xi) all the even terms become real and the odd terms become imaginary and amazingly the real terms correspond with the sin(x) infinite series and the imaginary with cos(x) infinite series multiplied by i. It&#39;s not really a hard formula to understand, what is amazing about it is the fact that all these unique terms, functions and ratios are related to each other.", "comment_date": "2015-10-07T05:40:46Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Mircea Nistor", "comment_text": "I love your animations.

Then you measure the distance from the pointer(our final &quot;1&quot; position) to 0, using something akin to an unstretched ruler(a ruler that maintains the original dimensions), to get the final product?", "comment_date": "2015-07-17T02:46:34Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "jzar eva", "comment_text": "Would it be an insult to ask you to make this same video again?
