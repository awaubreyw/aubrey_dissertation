[{"comment_by": "3Blue1Brown", "comment_text": "Some added notes (I may come back to add more later):<br><br>1) There&#39;s a slight error in the video where I say the answer is floor(pi/theta).  Really it should be ceil(pi/theta) - 1, to account for the cases where pi/theta is an integer.  For example, when the mass ratio is 1, theta will be pi/4, so pi/theta is 4, but there are 3 clacks.  As stated in the video, though, you still think about this is &quot;how many times can you add theta to itself before it surpasses (or equals) pi?&quot;<br><br><br>2) What I animate here as I say &quot;angle of reflection&quot; and &quot;angle of incidence&quot; differs a little with convention.  Typically in optics, you look at the angle between the beam and a line <b>perpendicular</b> to the mirror, rather than with the mirror itself.<br><br>3) Some people have asked about if the tan(x) \u2248 x approximation, being off by only a cubic error term, is actually close enough not to affect the final count.  It&#39;s actually a very interesting answer!  I really went back and forth on whether or not to include this in the video but decided to leave it out to better keep things to the point.  This difference between arctan(x) and x could be problematic for our final count if, at some point when you&#39;re looking at the first 2n digits of pi, the last n of them are all 9&#39;s.  It seems exceedingly unlikely that this should be true.  For example, among the first 100 million digits of pi, the maximal sequence of consecutive 9&#39;s has length 8, whereas you&#39;d need a sequence of 50 million for things to break our count!  Nevertheless, this is quite difficult to prove, related to the question of whether or not pi is a &quot;normal&quot; number, roughly meaning that it&#39;s digits behave like a random sequence.  It was left as a conjecture in Galperin&#39;s paper on the topic.  See sections 9 and 10 of that paper (linked in the description) for more details.<br><br>4) A word on terminology:  I tend to use the word \u201cphase space\u201d to describe any space like the ones described in this video and the last, encoding some state of some system.  This is common in the context of math, but you should know, that often in the context of mechanics, this term is reserved for the special case of a space which encodes both the positions and the momenta of all the objects involved.  For example, in that setting, the \u201cphase space\u201d here would be four-dimensional, where the four coordinates represent the position and momentum of each pair of blocks.  The term \u201cconfiguration space\u201d, in contrast, just refers to one where the coordinates describe the positions of all the objects involved, which is what we did here.<br><br>I hope you enjoyed this little sequence.

It\u2019s the other way around. Y\u2019all dumb and I just don\u2019t know. Took awhile to grasps this process. Math will keep being done wrong and carefully selected for the path chosen. Lol you all know it. What if the math selected and the path don\u2019t match lol. WHO/WHY is math being done? I wonder what would happen to the dimensions who fails to see that. This is a Conscious collective choice for those already in dimensions. A world of problem is coming your way magicians. You\u2019ll have children doing math that have no core of understanding in imagination(your way) or lack how to enter lol. They were given a shallow vague answer some wouldn\u2019t care and still want to participate but I see this view or idea will give birth to a child who will \u201cHURT\u201d society sooooo it\u2019s funny. Math is being used in \u201cWORDS (spell), selected ideas, societal norms, mind selection in kids, intelligence guided programs and intelligent feed selected minds.

I see the patterns I just don\u2019t care no more. Movies and tv show already showed me the threat. Waking up a dangerous child from their own self imposed nightmare. I think I\u2019ll let nature handle that problem since 1 of you likes to fuq with the smart kid in the room. Motion doesn\u2019t give birth to (e) careful which (e) you are motioning. Lol. This dimension like to see things only in parts(individualism - a line) but a circle is a line in its proper view of our dimension. Society isn\u2019t doing it for kids because all kids have the \u201cACKNOWLEDGED\u201d they understand. So it has to be the other way around. For Adults because of kids\ud83d\ude08 interesting.

Consider the angle changes from the reference frame of the test mass. The integer part of number of angle changes encountered by the test mass corresponds to the number of bounces by the two masses.

We have computed its value to trillions of digits, but we will obviously never compute (or physically witness) the actual value. Only ever approximations upto n digits.<br>My question: So what if we use Pi as our standard unit to measure. Our Unit. Make Pi the &quot;One&quot; of Math. Wouldn&#39;t that make computation (and in general, every math and every equation) so much simpler? Pi is no longer 3.14159265358979323 of 1.

If we say m1 = 1 kg and m2 = 1 kg, the angle of the slope, theta, will be 45 degrees or 0.7854 radians. If we increase the mass of m2 to 10 kg, the resulting angle is 72.45 degrees or 1.2645 radians. All of the scenarios where we increase m2 by factors of ten result in angles that far exceed the value for theta shown in the video such as 17 degrees or 0.1 radians (5.73 degrees). I don&#39;t see a case where the given masses provide a slope that would result in the &quot;bounces of light&quot; equaling values of pi.

The answer I finally came up with is yes. If you take the result (the number of clicks), then multiply it by sqrt(m2/m1)/(m2/m1), no matter what the ratio of m1 is to m2, you always get a number approaching pi. The bigger the ratio is, the more accurate the result is. This explains why 100 works so well - it will always be a factor of 10 higher. But it also explains why this would work in other base systems. For example, if m1 were 16,777,216 times the mass of m2 (or 0x100000), the resulting number of clicks is 12,867, or 0x3243.
