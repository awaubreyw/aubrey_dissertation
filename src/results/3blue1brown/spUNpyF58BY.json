Consider the man (THE EYE) that actually IS IN what is outer \u201cspace\u201d. Think about TIME, AND notice the associated DOME AND black \u201cspace\u201d AS WELL !!! IMPORTANTLY, now, the stars AND PLANETS are POINTS in the night sky ON/IN BALANCE !!!! GREAT !!! So, of course, consider what is THE SUN ON/IN BALANCE; AND think about the speed of light (c) AS WELL. Great !!! NOW, consider what is the man (AND THE EYE ON BALANCE) who IS actually standing ON what is THE EARTH/ground (ON/IN BALANCE) !!! Time AND SPACE are proportionately extended AND BALANCED, as ELECTROMAGNETISM/energy is CLEARLY AND NECESSARILY proven to be gravity (ON/IN BALANCE) !!!! Accordingly, ON BALANCE, TIME AND time dilation ULTIMATELY prove (ON BALANCE) that ELECTROMAGNETISM/energy is CLEARLY gravity !!! Regarding WHAT IS the man (AND THE EYE ON BALANCE) who IS actually standing ON what is THE EARTH/ground, touch AND feeling BLEND; as ELECTROMAGNETISM/energy is (CLEARLY AND NECESSARILY) proven to be gravity (ON/IN BALANCE). Consider what is the speed of light (c) ON BALANCE, AS the stars AND PLANETS are POINTS in the night sky (ON BALANCE) !! Great. Gravitational force/ENERGY IS proportional to (or BALANCED with/as) inertia/INERTIAL RESISTANCE on balance, as ELECTROMAGNETISM/energy is CLEARLY AND NECESSARILY proven to be gravity (ON/IN BALANCE). This CLEARLY explains F=ma AND E=mc2 ON BALANCE, as this NECESSARILY represents, INVOLVES, AND DESCRIBES what is possible/potential AND actual ON/IN BALANCE. SO, carefully consider why there is something instead of nothing ON/IN BALANCE. GREAT !!! Gravity/acceleration involves BALANCED inertia/INERTIAL RESISTANCE on balance, AS ELECTROMAGNETISM/energy is CLEARLY AND NECESSARILY proven to be gravity (ON/IN BALANCE). This explains F=ma AND E=mc2. This NECESSARILY (AND CLEARLY) represents, INVOLVES, AND DESCRIBES what is possible/potential AND actual ON/IN BALANCE, as ELECTROMAGNETISM/energy is (CLEARLY AND NECESSARILY) proven to be gravity (ON/IN BALANCE). This also CLEARLY explains why the rotation of WHAT IS THE MOON matches it&#39;s revolution. Indeed, get a good LOOK at what is the orange AND SETTING Sun ON BALANCE. In DIRECT (AND proper) comparison, they are BOTH necessarily the SAME SIZE as what is THE EYE. E=MC2 IS F=MA. Carefully consider what is THE EARTH/ground (ON/IN BALANCE) !!! The sky is blue, AND THE EARTH is ALSO BLUE. (Carefully consider what is BALANCED BODILY/VISUAL EXPERIENCE.) \u201cMass&quot;/ENERGY IS GRAVITY. \u201cMass&quot;/ENERGY involves BALANCED inertia/INERTIAL RESISTANCE consistent with/as what is BALANCED electromagnetic/gravitational force/ENERGY, as E=mc2 IS F=ma; as ELECTROMAGNETISM/energy is CLEARLY AND NECESSARILY proven to be gravity (ON/IN BALANCE). Great. Accordingly, ON BALANCE, objects fall at the SAME RATE (neglecting air resistance, of course). Beautiful. It ALL CLEARLY makes perfect sense ON BALANCE, as balance AND completeness go hand in hand. Balanced inertia/INERTIAL RESISTANCE is fundamental. Energy has/involves GRAVITY, AND ENERGY has/involves BALANCED inertia/INERTIAL RESISTANCE. I have explained the cosmological redshift, the supergiant stars, stellar clustering, what is a quasar, the fourth dimension, AND the term c4 from Einstein&#39;s field equations. The stars AND PLANETS are POINTS in the night sky ON BALANCE. It makes perfect sense ON BALANCE that THE PLANETS move away very, very, very, very slightly in relation to what is the Sun. Great. What is a galaxy does consist of invisible AND VISIBLE SPACE in fundamental equilibrium AND BALANCE. Importantly, it involves stars together AND stars apart ON BALANCE. Consider the supernovae AND the birthing of stars together. There is no need for any \u201cdark matter/ENERGY&quot;. ELECTROMAGNETISM/energy is CLEARLY AND NECESSARILY proven to be gravity (ON/IN BALANCE) in accordance with the fact that E=mc2 IS F=ma ON/IN BALANCE. Again, this necessarily represents, INVOLVES, AND DESCRIBES why there is something instead of nothing (ON/IN BALANCE) in accordance WITH what is possible/potential AND actual (ON/IN BALANCE) !!!! Great. Carefully consider what is THE SUN ON BALANCE !!!! Magnificent !!!! It ALL CLEARLY makes perfect sense ON BALANCE !!!!! TIME AND time dilation ULTIMATELY prove (ON BALANCE) that ELECTROMAGNETISM/energy is CLEARLY gravity !!! E=MC2 IS F=MA. Consider what is the role OR RELATION of THE EYE ON BALANCE. Lastly, it is absolutely CLEAR that the tides are ELECTROMAGNETIC/gravitational ON BALANCE.

I have totally outsmarted and exposed the weasel Einstein. Dream experience is/involves true/real QUANTUM GRAVITY. FACT.<br><br>It is a very great truth that THE SELF represents, FORMS, and experiences a COMPREHENSIVE approximation of experience in general by combining conscious and unconscious experience. Moreover, it is another great fact that the ability of thought to describe OR RECONFIGURE sensory experience is ultimately dependent upon the extent to which thought is similar to sensory experience. The integrated extensiveness of thought (AND description) is improved in the truly superior mind. (Thoughts are invisible.)<br><br>THE TRUE MATHEMATICAL PROOF THAT E=mc\u00b2 (CLEARLY) REPRESENTS A TWO DIMENSIONAL SURFACE OR SPACE (ON BALANCE), THEREBY EXPLAINING WHY ELECTROMAGNETISM/energy is gravity ON BALANCE:<br><br>Consider what is THE SUN. Consider what is THE EYE. Consider what is the blue sky ON BALANCE. E=mc\u00b2 represents a two dimensional surface OR SPACE ON BALANCE WITH what is THE FOURTH dimension (and c4), as the stars AND PLANETS are POINTS in the night sky ON BALANCE. E=mc\u00b2 is F=ma. Consider the TIDES in relation to what is the fully illuminated (AND WHITE) setting Moon. NOW, consider what is the ORANGE AND setting Sun. They ARE the same size as what is THE EYE ON BALANCE !!! Consider what is the balanced MIDDLE DISTANCE in/of SPACE. Consider what is the speed of light (c) ON BALANCE. Consider what is THE EARTH/ground ON BALANCE. The sky is blue, and THE EARTH is ALSO BLUE. The stars AND PLANETS are POINTS in the night sky. Think what involves BALANCED BODILY/VISUAL EXPERIENCE (on balance). Consider what is the man (AND THE EYE ON BALANCE) who actually IS standing on what is THE EARTH/ground (ON BALANCE) !!! CLEARLY, gravity AND ELECTROMAGNETISM/energy are linked AND BALANCED opposites (ON BALANCE); as ELECTROMAGNETISM/energy is (CLEARLY AND NECESSARILY) proven to be gravity (ON/IN BALANCE). Consider TIME (AND time dilation) ON BALANCE. E=mc\u00b2 is F=ma. BALANCE AND completeness go hand in hand, as it ALL CLEARLY makes perfect sense ON BALANCE. BALANCED inertia/INERTIAL RESISTANCE is fundamental. CLEARLY, E=mc\u00b2 represents a two dimensional surface OR SPACE (ON BALANCE).<br><br>In dreams, it is you AND other than you are IN BALANCE. Consider what is THE EYE. In dream experience, very importantly, BODILY/VISUAL EXPERIENCE is invisible AND VISIBLE in what is fundamental equilibrium AND BALANCE. Dream experience GROWS/increases. (There is no outsmarting the genius of dreams, in fact.) Dream experience FUNDAMENTALLY DOES improve upon memory AND UNDERSTANDING !! Dream experience is/involves true/real quantum gravity. Consider TIME (AND time dilation) ON BALANCE !! Consider what is the man (THE EYE) that ACTUALLY IS IN what is outer \u201cspace\u201d ON BALANCE. TIME dilation ULTIMATELY proves ON BALANCE that ELECTROMAGNETISM/energy is CLEARLY AND NECESSARILY proven to be what is gravity (ON/IN BALANCE), as E=mc\u00b2 CLEARLY is F=ma (ON BALANCE) as what is a BALANCED MIDDLE DISTANCE in/of SPACE !!! CLEARLY, ON BALANCE, E=mc\u00b2 represents a two dimensional surface OR SPACE. It is mathematically proven.<br><br>F=ma AND E=mc\u00b2 represent a two dimensional surface OR SPACE ON BALANCE !!! This is consistent with the fourth dimension (AND the term c to the fourth power) from Einstein&#39;s field equations. The stars AND PLANETS are POINTS in the night sky. Consider what is THE EYE ON BALANCE !!! CONSIDER WHAT IS THE SUN ON BALANCE !!! GREAT !!! This NECESSARILY represents, INVOLVES, AND DESCRIBES what is possible/potential AND actual IN/ON BALANCE. That&#39;s the answer. Consider TIME (AND time dilation) ON BALANCE !!! Consider what is the speed of light (c) ON BALANCE !!! Consider what is THE EARTH/ground ON BALANCE !!! E=mc\u00b2 IS F=ma. The sky is blue, and THE EARTH is ALSO BLUE. (LOOK UP at what is the blue sky ON BALANCE.) I have also CLEARLY explained why the rotation of WHAT IS THE MOON matches it&#39;s revolution. GREAT.

It is really worth the time to watch many times imo and compare with the math one has previous learned about the several flavors of the FT. One little note though regarding what is said at ~<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spUNpyF58BY&amp;t=15m00s\">15:00</a> in the video: sampling the original signal in time still gives the exact same reconstruction as if the original continuous signal were used as long as we sample it fast enough (twice of the Nyquist freq as the most who are reading this knows). Also, the relative amplitudes of those &#39;undesired small artifact wobblings&#39;  which don&#39;t relate to the real frequencies present int he original signal will also not change with higher sampling rate or if the original continuous signal is used. However, if the original signal is longer, the fact that we will have &#39;more signal thread length&#39; to do more windings around the &#39;unit circle reel&#39; will allow the area below these &#39;artifact wobblings&#39; to get smaller and smaller:  in other words the &#39;center of mass plot&#39; get compressed in its x-axis but their relative peaks with the respect of the main peak will stay. they essentially become delta functions. Maybe I missed a detail or got something wrong in my mind while thinking about this while driving to work today, but I think that is what is going to happen.

Only by the end of the video was it possible for me to deduce that it is neither, and the mass-density is instead equal to the radius times the &#39;dt&#39; infinitesimal of the unit-circle arc length. This confusion made the video 40 min long instead of 20 min.  But I don&#39;t care.  I am extremely grateful for this video.  It was awesome.  I&#39;m a physics-major and I never understood the Fourier transform until now because my university didn&#39;t go over it carefully enough and their continual torrent of homework assignments never allowed me to look into it independently, and yet, they required me to use the Fourier Transform after only giving me a highschool-level explanation of what it did, and this triggered my ADHD terribly because I need to know everything.

So the fourier transform depends on omega. The idea behind this circle wrapping is that if omega is a frequency that appears in the original signal, this average distance to the origin will be large. Otherwise, the average distance will be small. So if you plot it for many omega you can easily see which frequencies are the most prominent in the original signal, because those will have the highest average distance to the origin, corresponding to peaks in the plot. The FT is meant for continuous signals. There&#39;s also the DFT which is the discrete fourier transform, for discrete signals.

These concepts are enormously important to signal processing.  Even the lowly AM radio is better understood with these concepts.<br><br>A &quot;superheterodyne&quot; AM radio receiver works like this: the &quot;winding frequency&quot; (called a &quot;local oscillator&quot; -- local, because it&#39;s in the receiver not the transmitter) is adjusted by the tuning dial to shift the desired radio station&#39;s frequency to an intermediate frequency (&quot;IF&quot;), which is then amplified enormously (it&#39;s easier to build a good, fixed-frequency amplifier than a good, tunable one). Then the amplified IF signal is &quot;detected&quot; using a non-linearity (a diode, which gives the absolute value) essentially using the IF signal itself as the &quot;winding frequency&quot;.  A resistor/capacitor filter acts as the integrator to give the average &quot;center of mass&quot;, which is the recovered audio signal.<br><br>&quot;Oh, but AM radio is so last-century.  Fourier is old tech!&quot;  Consider that audio compression protocols like mp3 use the Fourier transform to convert each time chunk of audio into frequencies, then throw away the parts of the signal that won&#39;t be missed by human ears (due to &quot;auditory masking&quot;).

A pure Fourier transform (as described at <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spUNpyF58BY&amp;t=5m35s\">5:35</a>) would show a &quot;peak&quot; at the tone being played. But since each string instrument has multiple over- &amp; undertones, you would ALSO get a peak for each of those.<br><br>So if we have a recording of a single instrument playing (for example) A0 (A-string, finger position 0), could we somehow use this known signal to extract when in the recording, that instrument plays A0?", "comment_date": "2021-05-14T19:57:02Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "\u304f\u308b\u308a", "comment_text": "why there are not Japanese subtitles?", "comment_date": "2021-05-14T12:36:40Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Fun Kids", "comment_text": "Such videos should be on the beginning of every university class.

They possibly may be  3 dimensional and third dimension is duration  of sampling operation, calculation time  and shifts of back restoration..Time is not mathematical value, affects physics and that is problem with full match. .

This is more about the hysteresis from the magnetic/dielectric perturbations through the medium of air i.e., the loss of inertia from the compressions and reifications that create a contingent manifestation of consubstantiality. Moreover, the geometry identified in the sound produced is a product of the magnetic/dielectric field from non-point source specific emanation. <br><br>Watch from <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spUNpyF58BY&amp;t=2m32s\">2:32</a>mins - <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spUNpyF58BY&amp;t=2m37s\">2:37</a>mins and you will see the toroid (which finishes in a cardioid i.e., Mandelbrot set.

Also, at <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spUNpyF58BY&amp;t=5m37s\">5:37</a>mins you can also see the Mandelbrot set and the precession remains inside the cardioid which determines that the centre of mass is finite as it is precession on the frequency. I would also say that the precession will extend to 42 degrees at the maximum finite frequency from the 0 point (i.e., the centre of mass before the frequency begins pression) around the centre of the mass of that specific frequency, making the signal non-point source specific in determination.<br><br>BTW: That spike in the frequency at <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spUNpyF58BY&amp;t=6m48s\">6:48</a>mins on the chart at the bottom right is a Draupner Wave - remember we do live in a super fluid i.e., oxygen rich/H2O rich environment.

I really like the use of visual diagrams, it&#39;s a good contrast to the more algebraic style I usually encounter. This video and your video about Fourier Series in particular were especially helpful to me. As an IB student, I decided to do my EE on using Fourier Analysis to study music, and I decided on my topic largely because of those videos! I based my paper pretty heavily off of your work so far (and cited you of course!) These videos are a lifesaver, they made it possible for me to fight my way through college-level papers and kind of understand the confusing, formal style because I could connect it to your more intuitive approach. <br><br>I have one small question. In the example of wrapping the sine wave around the origin, we see the &quot;center of mass&quot; or integral shift away from the origin when the frequency of the vector rotation is equal to the sine wave&#39;s frequency. We also see interesting patterns of flower-like shapes when the sine wave&#39;s frequency is an integer multiple of the vector&#39;s frequency. However, what happens when the vector is rotating at twice the frequency of the sine wave? For example, what would the graph wrapped around the circle look like for the 3 beats/second sine wave if the vector completed 6 rotations every second? I wonder if this is connected to overtones and fundamental frequencies, as I have wondered why sometimes when you play a note on a percussion instrument (my PVC xylophone I made for Science Olympiad) I will sometimes hear another quieter note an octave or perfect fifth higher.

The D string is played simultaneously with the A string and the tuning peg is turned and adjusted until a perfect 5th interval is reached, which (with a  bit of practice) is very obvious to the player as it sounds purely in tune.   A similar approach is to use the fact that as the D string gets close to being in tune with the reference A string, an audible &#39;beat&#39; is heard, which changes speed, and then disappears (or is very slow and not noticeable) when a perfect 5th is reached.

I owe you (in part) my Ph.D. in process engineering. This video is my favorite so I hoped to reach you here. I had a suggestion for a video; what is Dimensional analysis (Buckingham Pi theory) and why does it work? I use it frequently at my job and I know how to do it procedurally, but I don&#39;t understand why it works or how whoever invented it invented it. I felt the same way about calculus until I stumbled across your delightful explanation in the calculus series, and was hoping you could shed a light on Dimensional analysis as I feel its a pretty obscure bit of math (at least to the people in my industry: pharmaceutical engineering). In particular, I don&#39;t understand why the relationships of dimensionless Pi groups (Reynolds number, Weber number, Archimedes number, etc.) must fall on the same curve. I find that magical and I just can&#39;t wrap my head around why that was an expected outcome of the person inventing the technique. <br>Great work with the live shows btw, I watched a few, It feels like you are my personal remedial math tutor.

Because we live in 3 dimensions, you can put yourself parallel to the plane that motion is set in a 2 dimensional plane. The fourier transform describes (de encodes) the variation of motion within that 2d plane into it&#39;s different components on the 2 plane, one for each axis, by recursivley sampling infinetly close to that signal.

In all the abstraction much of the visualization and application is kind of lost. Unfortunately the university I attended strictly placed emphasis  on proof through abstraction and considered visualization and application as second fiddles to proof through abstract means and you quickly found out whether you were a fit for the program. I on the other hand saw both the visualization of what was occurring in a structure and applications as a solid basis for how to approach showing a theorem to be valid with abstract means and certainly appreciate what you have done in this video.

The magnet looks like a large soup can with a metal tube running from top to bottom in the center. About 1 in 1,000,000,000 of the hydrogen atoms line up with the magnetic field. You then send a radio frequency pulse into the sample. Some of the aligned atoms absorb some energy from the applied signal. After the pulse stops, these atoms emit the energy as radio waves.

The same you do for the tone D, saying its frequency is 294 Hz. Both are oversimplified statements because both the tone A and D are not simple harmonic signals, they are periodic ones instead having a fundamental frequency of 440 Hz or 294 Hz, but also their harmonics, even with less amplitude.  This also mean that the time signal is not such a simple harmonic oscillation.

I mean it&#39;s really really awful when I can&#39;t find the solution of something specially if it&#39;s stupidly simple. <br>I appreciate the help", "comment_date": "2019-05-02T14:15:22Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Rusbel Hernandez", "comment_text": "why professors do not explain this concept like this?", "comment_date": "2019-05-02T03:15:30Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "w0ttheh3ll", "comment_text": "mega awesome video! left me wondering about just one detail: which part of the output is useful? the real part? the imaginary? both? or the absolute value?", "comment_date": "2019-05-01T22:18:23Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Envy Bartowski", "comment_text": "must have taken so much work :o thanks for the video", "comment_date": "2019-05-01T20:36:02Z", "likes_count": 2}, {"comment_by": "Andre Panossian", "comment_text": "i love you", "comment_date": "2019-05-01T17:53:11Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Archana Verma", "comment_text": "Quick question :) For the wave of 3 beats/s, we see the spike in the &quot;center of mass and winding frequency&quot; plot at 3 cycle/s; what happens at 6 cycle/s?

Its solution seems quite elementary, a bit like a coffin problem. <br><br>The set, D, is defined by twice the distance from the origin to every point on B.  Thus, the x,y and z components are multiplied separately for every point; if a point is 2x as far as another in z, but the same distance in x, x for both points will be 2x, but for one point z will be 2z, and for another, 4z.<br><br>This results in a shell (filled with all the other vectors where the distance between the sample points does not go to zero), which is a proportional distortion of the parent surface, B.

For me, it would be more symmetrical if we talked about distance from the origin. In terms of complex numbers, he uses Re g^ and Im g^, and I&#39;d like |g^| and arg g^ more. Also, it may have something to do with sampling function: he chooses to use sine, not cosine. I guess that sine is coupled with x and cosine would be coupled with y. But this coupling <b>is</b> important - if we look at plot of Im g^, its peaks does <b>not</b> correspond to component frequency (it&#39;s derivative would I think).<br><br>To become independent of this coupling or initial choice of sine vs. cosine, we could start with probing function of the form sin(t + fi), and take average for all phases fi. It would rotate the rosetta about the origin---you can see that by comparison of its complex form, where addition of this phase gives g(t)*e^(2 i pi (t + fi)) = e^(2i pi fi) g(t) e^(2 i pi t) = C g^(t), where C is e to imaginary number, or rotation.<br><br>This averaging has more physical meaning. In these simple examples the probing funtion and the one tested are synchronized, their sines both start at 0. But in real world we might not now that. If we are given some music of 4 notes with high pitch noise, we don&#39;t know (yet) where the start is. My proposed averaging - or simply taking the distance from zero / magnitude |g^| avoids problems here.<br>---<br>Very instructive and smart video.

It seems that no book and no teacher ever explains it as such.  It appears that Laplace and Fourier gave their public lectures, but they were not really fully understood, and the manner in which Fourier and Laplace transform are taught,  does not really produce the outcome that engineers,and laymen really need. It may come as a surprise but we even need to use Fourier and Laplace and other recognition functions when we judge an examination or even in the court of justice........ all examiners and judges need to use a form of Fourier and Laplace and other recognition function to conclude  on how close is the judgement  of an action ( unknown function) to some form of reference ( a known reference or kernel). <br>Let us say that the teacher T is required to judge and examine the standard of a student S. Obviously it is the teacher T who is the kernel or the Reference to which the unknown student S is compared to. So we need an operator which we can use to compare the knowledge of the teacher T  with that of the student S. If we chose the ( --  ) minus sign we can measure the error function between the teacher and the student and this would be  E= ( T -- S ).  Unfortunately this will not do, as we require an operation that will take care of an absolute magnitude of ERROR , or a DIFFERENCE, if it exists  between teacher T and student S.   It would be better to chose an error function operator describes by   E= (  T-<del>S) ^2  which is equal to ,  Error=  T^2 --</del> 2 *T*S  +  S^2   . Now note the following:  ----<br>T^2 is an entity belonging to the Teacher  T alone as  if it was his own &quot;energy&quot;<br>S^2 is an entity belonging  to the Student  S alone  as if it was his own  &quot; energy&quot;<br>But  the product 2*T*S  is an entity which links up the knowledge of the Teacher with that of the Student ,  AND THIS IS EXACTLY IN THE FORM AS BOTH FOURIER AND LAPLACE FUNCTION  where T is  representing the Kernel or the Reference, while  S is  representing the unknown function we are studying and need to be recognised.<br>Putting it in another manner,  if we want a bomber pilot to go and release his bombs over an unknown target (S), we have to provide the pilot with a known photograph (T) of the target, if we want to ensure that the pilot would recognise the target.<br>Also if we want to go to the train station to recognise someone  unknown (S) we need to meet, we need to have at least a memorised face  in our mind (T)  or at least a photograph (T) of whom we are going to meet.<br>Now (T.S ) is a multiplication of the kernel, reference, photograph, memorised face,  musical piece, sport function,  even taste of food or a taste of whiskey (T),  by the unknown scenario  or situation WE NEED TO RECOGNISE (S). The product of the reference by the unknown function is in fact a form of a COMPARISON which could be cumulative or destructive. Now to make sure that we obtain the accuracy we need, if the functions are either functions of space and. or  time then we NEED TO INTEGRATE THE PRODUCT FUNCTION OVER THE DURATION OF THE TIME OR THE SPACE BOUNDING THE FUNCTION. So if we are trying to recognise a time function as seen in this video, or walking through a room to find the door opening, or listening to a piece of music, by Verdi, or any language, which we need to recognise  WE NEED TO INTEGRATE THE PRODUCT  OF T*S  over a long time or over a wider space and not focus only at one point of time or space.  The INTEGRAL IS IMPORTANT TO GET THE RECOGNITION ACCURACY.<br>Now let us apply this to Fourier Recognition function , let us say we have a square wave we need to recognise , This is how we write Fourier or Laplace for that matter.<br> <br>Harmonic content  =  (INTEGRAL  over time or space ) of  (Square wave  (replacing S or unknown target))  multiplied by ( ao  + a1* sin wt  + a2* sin 2wt  ........+ b1*coswt + B2*cos 2wt...... where this  series of harmonics replaces the reference teacher T or what is in the reference photograph or kernel)<br><br>Taking one of them only  say  Harmonic (w) = Integral over time or space of  ( Square wave  (replacing (S or unknown target))*(a1*sinwt.(replacing T  or  photo or kernel))<br><br>With Laplace,  integral of T*S is written as,  Integral over the duration of the  unknown function (F(t) * (e^jwt) where F(t) is the unknown function and  e^jwt is the kernel function we are using for comparison,  where e^jwt is only a pair of sine functions out of phase by 90 degrees to be able to account of any phase shifting of the unknown function.  At this stage it is much healthier if one could think three dimensionally where the unknown is a three dimensional entity while e^jwt is a perfect helix changing its frequency when we write it as     e^( r+jwt)   where we call s=  r+jwt as a complex frequency.   So  e^(r+jwt) plotted in three dimension could be a decaying, a continuous or an ever growing unstable helix.    This e^(st)   is all one finds in the control system <br> and analogue and digital filters and the poles and zeros  are all related to this ! It is a wonderful world of three dimensions and that is WHAT FOURIER AND LAPLACE  MEANT  WHEN THEY SUGGESTED THEIR RECOGNITION FUNCTIONS,  they are meant to be seen in three or more dimensions........... but let is stick to three.    Not that the Kernel need not be seen as helix , sine or cosine, but any kernel we chose even a set of spherical balls of different shape and size.   In fact I would say that we could apply Fourier and Laplace function to a block of concrete to see what size aggregate it contains.  Sound like we walked into a fairy land as Alice in Wonderland............. but if engineering students had to understand the hidden wonders of Laplace, Fourier and the Convoution Integral............ there is nothing much else to understand in engineering.    You know I would even venture to say that if one say,  consider two brothers or sisters, one can compare the two and get a weighting factor of the comparison, through applying Fourier and Laplace in the form as integral of the differences of their contours through the product (T * S).    It is fascinating to think that the error function (T ---S) ^2 contains so much information about T and S as individuals and as linked entities!<br><br>Once again Laplace and Fourier OPERATOR functions are not to be treated as a memorised set of ( s  formulas  or sine and cosine) results to apply in control, communications or for mathematical examinations.   Fourier and Laplace operators are used every single second we look at something or hear something, where what unknown action we see or hear is compared to what knowledge we have in our mind and after being conscious of what unknown we see and hear, we OPERATE IT BY MULTIPLICATION as was shown and the result of the integral of the product over time or the space we have before us. If say we are  walking or driving a car......... then that result is the recognition weighting function which will enable to decide if we recognise a doorway in a room,  or if we would hit an enemy plane if we are a fighter pilot,  or  if we are examiners of students correcting examinations, if we recognise our wife or girlfriend  ( as I am a man)  or if we recognise our friends or children. Note that if our memory does  not  contain the reference  we need then WE CANNOT RECOGNISE WHAT IS INCLUDED  in the language, the music, <br> we hear or the scene  we see in front of us............. and we need to carry a photograph to act as a kernel for comparison. The reason we cannot understand some languages we hear is simply because we do not have  the kernel of that particular language in our memory.  <br><br>Many people driving a car and pilots make mistakes when flying and  people in racing cars have incidents................ BECAUSE THE PEOPLE CONCERNED DO NOT KNOW THAT THE INTEGRAL TO RECOGNISE ACCURATE NEED TO BE LONG ENOUGH BE IT SPACE OR TIME WHICH ONE IS OPERATING IN  , OR BOTH FOR THAT MATTER.<br><br>To live safely in a city or anywhere else, one needs to fully understand  the operating components of both Fourier and Laplace and other recognition functions   and permit the integral to be long enough..............otherwise the &quot; error&quot; will not have time to build up and the comparison will be unfocused and without resolution.<br>I wager that few have ever seen Fourier or Laplace function being represented like that.   I am going to read this again as carefully as I can, but  my apologies if I do not present this to perfection, as it must be.

I came away from the class vaguely understanding that the fourier transform could detect natural frequencies of complex mechanical systems.  There are two math problems (Integrals) that could be solved manually.  One is either the sine or cosine function and the other is the opposite - I forget.  One of them is trivial or can almost be solved by inspection the other takes a bit more doing.  On the test we were given the one that takes a bit more doing which I was given generous partial credit on when graded.  There was a machine that would do this. (a frequency analyzer part of an oscilloscope(?)) It was the size of a small microwave oven and very expensive. After all these years I run across your video and voila! it makes so much more sense!!!!!!

However, knowing the math and the mathematical principles is essential to having more than just a shallow understanding. What is being shown here is a combination of continuous domain and discrete domain Fourier series, convolution, and other principles and ideas. Some of the description, while nice and approachable, is misleading. Why refer to &quot;beats&quot;? It&#39;s all just cycles per second aka Hertz (in audio and EM domains). There is no &quot;chaos&quot;, and using that word is misleading to the student as it implies some aspect of Fourier theory is either very hard to understand or not understood or may indeed be chaos, which has its own definition. Also, the Fourier Transform of a pure sinusoid is a delta function. By ignoring convolution, the visual explanation for what is shown, a Sinc function convolved with a delta, is not only inaccurate and misleading, but fails to capitalize on the opportunity to simplify the whole explanation, which is the point of the video is it not?<br><br>It&#39;s great to have explanatory visualizations and easy enough to do yourself in MATLAB or Octave, so I suggest students try all this for themselves.<br><br>Finally, if you want to really understand the theory, attend the lectures and read the books, do the problems. As some have pointed out, mathematics is just the language to express ideas, much the same as musical notation is the language to express musical ideas.

There are a couple of aspects that stll have not been revealed. The first is - it is true we can now <b>interpret</b> the meaning of the expressions in an intuitive way but we still don&#39;t know which was the intuitive way of <b>constructing</b> these expressions for the <b>first</b> time. For example, all I know is Fourier <b>somehow</b> contructed these expressions when he was researching the transfer of the heat across the metal rod (at least I think so). The next &#39;mystery&#39; is - what makes sine and cosine functions so special that we always decompose the signals to sine/cosine components despite each signal could be decomposed into the series of <b>any</b> polynomials that are mutally orthogonal (e.g. Legendre polynomials)? My intuitive assumption is sin and cos are special because these are the only periodic functions where derivation and integration does not change the function shape - these operations just change sin to cos and vise versa and cos is sin with phase shift so it is in fact the same function. e^x doesn&#39;t change with these operations too but that function isn&#39;t periodic so it can not represent the waves propagating through space. It would be nice if you could describe an intuitive approach of constructing/synthesizing Fourier Transform expressions starting from <b>scratch</b> - trying to replicate the Fourier&#39;s thinking/approach which resulted with these expressions. I don&#39;t think he could visualize these animated winding graphs upon which he would construct the expressions. Or maybe he could?

I really wanted to thank you for all the incredible contributions you&#39;ve given to my understanding of maths.

That was the case with the Taylor series, determinants, the fundamental theorem of calculus, among other examples. <br>There&#39;s a topic I&#39;m really looking forward to see in one of your videos: the Laplace transform. I understand it is a transform with the amazing property of transforming the derivative of an input function into simple algebraic expressions involving no derivatives, allowing us to easily solve differential equations, and I have used it for that purpose quite a bit. However, I have no idea of WHY does it exhibit such properties, and I&#39;m sure there are plenty of crazy graphical intuitions about it&#39;s inner workings that you can enlighten us with. <br>Greetings from Ecuador, keep up the great work, man!", "comment_date": "2018-02-03T03:11:22Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Mark Terrano", "comment_text": "This was excellent - really great graphics and illustrations too!", "comment_date": "2018-02-03T01:50:44Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "mathSci", "comment_text": "wow......", "comment_date": "2018-02-03T01:46:43Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "jmbbao", "comment_text": "<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spUNpyF58BY&amp;t=0m53s\">0:53</a> A=440 beats per second.

I&#39;m pretty bad explaining in technical math terms so I&#39;ll just explain in simpler terms.<br><br>Your convex surface is a continuous surface, so if you choose any point on the boundary, there is bound to be more points around the small neighbourhood which are also on the boundary. D is formed by choosing any two points on the boundary, p and q, and summing up their values. Suppose I choose a certain point p. Then, to maximise the magnitude of the resultant vector, i choose q which is very close to p, let&#39;s say q = p + dx. Then we add them together. We get p + q = p + p + dx = 2p + dx. The actual vectors I use would have 3 coordinates but I&#39;m just simplifying it here and using the magnitude as analogous to the vector itself.<br><br>If you choose any point p and find 2p, you&#39;ll end up with something right outside the boundary of D. If you choose any two points which aren&#39;t very close to each other, you&#39;ll end up somewhere inside the boundary of D instead. But for all points p on B, 2p will be right outside the boundary of D, as the boundary of D actually excludes all values 2p, yet includes the values really close to 2p. Since all p + q is bound by the surface created by 2p, and 2p comes from p on B, given that B is convex, the surface generated by 2p should also be convex. Since the surface generated by 2p just covers the boundary of D (imagine that there&#39;s an infinitesimally small distance which makes it exactly cover all the points in D yet doesn&#39;t touch D), logically D should also be convex.<br><br>Makes any sense?

We know every point on the line connecting 2a and 2b will also be in E (consider 2x for some x on the line connecting a and b in C), which means E is convex.

Most likely, the length of the vector (r-x) will differ from the length of the vector (s-x).

Also, taking a intersecting plane that contains the origin and applying the puzzle on this 2D example, corresponds exactly to the 3D equivalent. Therefore, solving for this planar one, will solve the original. So now the problem consist of solving for the set of points in a convex closed curve.<br><br>Claim: D&#39;s boundaries are similar to C&#39;s by a scale of 2<br>Proof:<br>        For proving that it&#39;s assumed that the origin(O) does not belong to C. This case will create a stronger proof than from the other one. Now, the closed curve is separated in two open curves: one with the concavity to O (concave) and the other not (convex). Those curses were separated in a way that any line coming from O would touch only one point of each. Let r be a line the passes through O and touches the curves. The smallest D vector that falls onto r is the one created with the point touched in the convex curve (A), and the biggest is the one created with the concave curve&#39;s point (B) and itself. It&#39;s going to be proved just one of these statements and the other is easily derived by taking similar steps.<br>        Take any line that passes through A. Any pair of points equidistants from A (one from the left and one from the right), create a vector of size 2A and that fall onto r. Putting that line further or closer  from O, while keeping as reference the point created by it and r, will increase and decrease respectively the size of the vector created by the pairs, while maintaining it on r. Since it can&#39;t be done pulling it closer, the only way is to increase the vector&#39;s size, thus proving the statement and consequently the first claim for the first case (O does not belong to C). For the second case just consider two concave curves sorrounding O.<br><br>Probable a generalization for higher dimensions(?):<br>        This proof might seem a kinda amateur (which i am), or even a bit clumsy, but I liked it by the fact that it easy generalize to higher dimensions. The step of correspondence between the second and third dimension can be applied between the third and the fourth, by considering three-dimensional sections of the four-dimensional set, the same between 4D and 5D, 5D and 6D, 6D ans 7D etc, all nD and n+1D pairs.

In all my years studying math and physics I have never ever understood the Fourier Transform.

I struggled with optics, sound, vibration modes and harmonic oscillators because of things like this.

I like your traditional 2D approach. You made Fourier Transforms surprisingly understandable. I think ALSO looking at a 3D representation and explanation can add some much needed intuition. If you look at a 3D model you begin to see what the fundamental connection is between your frequency (or more specifically sine waves) and the circle in the first place. It gives a reason for WHY we wrap the wave around the circle in the first place. If you just look at a 2D explanation it&#39;s not immediately obvious why we would go from one to the other in the first place.

The plan will cut C into a convex set C_x. <br>Now we want to show that there exist two point p and q in the frontier of C_x such that  x = (p+q)/2, to do so define a function f_x on [0,2Pi].<br>For any y in [0,2Pi] take the line that passes through x and that has angle y with the horizontal line, then take the two points (one ahead of x and one behind it in that direction) that are in the frontier of C_x and in this line, call these points a and b, f_x(y) is the difference of the distance between a and x and the distance between b and x. <br>With this definition f_x is well defined and continuous (because the boundary of C_x is a lace), we also have f_x(0)f_x(2pi) &lt;= 0. This shows that there is a point y&#39; such that f_x(y&#39;) = 0.

Because C is convex, it follows that S is a subset of C.<br><br>Now let x be an element of C. We can define a function f which takes a direction, described by a unit vector, and gives the distance from x to the boundary in that direction. This is where I don&#39;t know how rigorous you want me to be, but for the sake of the idea of the proof I will just claim that f is well-defined and continuous due to the boundedness, closedness and convexity of C. By the Borsuk-Ulam theorem we find a direction v such that f(v)=f(-v). It follows that p:=x+f(v)v and q:=x-f(-v)v are boundary points, i.e. elements of B, such that (p+q)/2=x. Therefore x is an element of S. This proves that C is also a subset of S, so S=C.<br><br>Remarks:<br>That f is continuous actually requires x to be an interior point of C. But if x is not an interior point, then by definition it must be an element of B, which means that (x+x)/2=x already proves that x is an element of S.<br>If you want a rigorous proof that f is well-defined and continuous, then if you ask nicely and convince me you are solid with the epsilon-delta definition, I think I will give you a proof.

This is the kind of stuff I get hung up on a lot; small, minor things that impede my understanding of the equation as a whole.

And Fourier transform has &quot;mass&quot; distributed evenly on the x-coordinate on the original graph or phi-coordinate on winded up graph. In the terms of integration there must be additional multiplier corresponding to the curve length in cylindrical coordinates. So I would be blown away if when you said &quot;One way to do it is to sample points and take average&quot; you commented on the limitations.
