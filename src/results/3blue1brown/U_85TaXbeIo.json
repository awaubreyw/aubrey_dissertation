You go to a technician and he tells you that 80% of the cases of laptop repair that come to him, have the same problem of whirring noise. You assume that the issue is from your hard-drive, and you read online that 20% of all laptop issues are hard-drive related, while the problem of getting a whirring noise from the laptop on boot from a hard-drive related issue is 50%. Given this information, you calculate the probability that you have a hard-drive related issue in your laptop ?\r<br>Answer:This is a simple application of bayes rule. \r<br>Here whirring noise is an \u201cEffect\u201d or symptom,and Hard-Drive related issues serve as a probable \u201cCause\u201d. Then P(cause) = 20% and P(effect) = 80%, and P(effect|cause) = 50%.

The reason is the commutivity of the intersection. The video gives a wrong impression: We are speaking about the probability of the intersection of two sets and not about the probability of an &quot;and assertion&quot;. In fact the probability theory is very missleading. Sometimes you form the probability of sets and sometimes the probability of assertions. Yes there is a straight connection between the assertion of membership and the fact to be a member. But it is not the same. Probability theory is not consistent. P(A|B) is the probability of an assertion (conditioned probability). P(A) and P(A intersects B) are probabilities of sets. The latter are consistent with set theory. Because the intersection is commutative the same intersection can be part of two different conditional probabilities around A and B. You get the identity in only one step. It is completely oversized to make an own &quot;theorem&quot; of this simple conclusion. It complicates instead of simplifiing. A theorem should assemble many steps. BTW: P(A|B) should not be regarded as a probability but as a constant describing the ratio of the the intersecting part with one of the intersecting partners. This would clarify the essence much more. It is clear that such a ratio can always be interpreted as a probability of a partial set.
