In 2022 we now observed that immunity is lost very fast, and that cross immunity is weak from one variant to the next.<br><br><br>The real mechanism for a covid wave extinction is still not a scientific consensus: the heard immunity, either natural or by vaccine is not the only candidate to explain the wave stopping. <br>Very detailled PCR observations over the last 2 years are strongly  suggesting that a variant is genetically weakened during its propagation/replication until it is unable to propagate anymore, thus stopping the wave. And also that eventually new variants comes from recombinations, not really mutations. <br><br>And also that animals such as furets and felines are now endemic reservoirs. All those new experimental facts are game changer for this kind of mathematical models interpretation.<br>The parameters of those SEIR models are very off, the models are forced to fit the real epidemics plot but is is just a false positive result. This is well know issue in chemical kinetics or plasma kinetics models.<br>Sad that the majority of epidemilogists still refuse to admit their errors.<br>Thanks again for your videos.", "comment_date": "2022-08-15T22:19:33Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Michael Essig", "comment_text": "I&#39;d be interested to see how re-infection and increased contagiousness of variants impact these models", "comment_date": "2022-07-21T10:54:22Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "johan wrigast", "comment_text": "The Deep State has been telling you what they were going to do the whole time.

Ideas I would suggest: Splitting the R group into a green Recovered group and a gray Deceased group. Green is temporary and wears off after some time. When a green person gets pinged by a red or yellow person, their timer resets. If they don&#39;t get pinged in long enough time, they go back to being blue. This represents novel strains evolving. Someone constantly exposed to the disease through the evolution of the novel strain maintains their immunity to the evolving strain, while someone who hasn&#39;t been exposed in a while becomes susceptible to those changes. And any yellow people will of course become green instead of gray when the infection runs its course, since not having symptoms means they won&#39;t die. And you could make the rate at which people turn green or gray after being red depend on how full the hospitals are at any moment. Red people who are at risk of dying turn purple, and if they can get into a hospital they have a very good chance to turn green and leave the hospital. But if they can&#39;t then they have a very high risk to turn gray. This makes it actually matter if there&#39;s a long tail or not, and can help compare what approaches are best given that the goal is to minimize the total number of times that people turn purple. It may turn out that various means of &quot;slowing the spread&quot; end up being detrimental in the long run because you&#39;re allowing the strain to avoid burning itself out for longer, so people recover and survive long enough to lose their immunity and get infected again.", "comment_date": "2022-05-25T03:45:20Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "\u5154\u7530\u83ab\u96f7\u62c924", "comment_text": "Thanks!", "comment_date": "2022-05-19T08:49:41Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "SungHa Kim", "comment_text": "\uc774\uc81c \uc624\ubbf8\ud06c\ub860 \ub355\ubd84(?)\uc5d0 \uac10\uc5fc\uc790\uac00 \ub9ce\uc544\uc9c0\uace0 \uce58\uba85\ub960\uc740 \ub0ae\uc544\uc84c\ub124\uc694. \ube68\ub9ac \uc774 \ucf54\ub85c\ub098 \uc0ac\ud0dc\uac00 \uc885\uc2dd \ub418\ub294 \ub0a0\uc774 \uc624\uae38...", "comment_date": "2022-04-26T08:39:49Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "FoxMaster", "comment_text": "From Belgium we had really poor result against covid and it&#39;s easy to explain why :<br>- A tiny area with many people.<br>- Old population.<br>- A lot of obesity.<br>- Extremely good transports, you can reach all key cities by trains (and it&#39;s quick because most cities merge to eachothers).<br>- Many neighboors from France, Germany, Netherlands, Luxembourg that work or study in Belgium.<br>- Students use to come back to their familly during weekends.<br>- Social distance was almost impossible for students that lives in the same house, they only have 1 kitchen or 1 toilet for 3 or 4 student.<br>- Cold country and the covid arrived during the first warm week of the year.<br>- Many covid cases in the cold season, which mean 80% of the year when people doesn&#39;t see the sun and get cold even without covid.<br>- When it&#39;s cold this is hard to open windows<br>- Chrismast is something important.<br>- Europe center, people from everywhere travel and cross the country with trucks and cars, Brussels airport is also a big point.<br>We tried everything possible but the stats are terrible, in fact it was impossible to do better, because there is no way to close a country like that, Belgium isn&#39;t self sufficent and the geography doesn&#39;t help, there is no mountains or anything, also Anvers is the second biggest port of Europe after Amsterdam, both a close to eachothers, the covid was there for sure", "comment_date": "2022-04-25T16:06:07Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Jemal Muhammed", "comment_text": "Really you are very very intelligent .

As we have seen in the meantime the SIR predictions have been completely discredited. Plus there is no way to hide from a virus and it is impossible to stop the people from dying. Social distancing makes no difference to total numbers. You can&#39;t hide from a virus. Slowing the spread will actually make it much more difficult to keep people who are at risk safe. As I pointed out in your Bayes Theorem post it is a lot more sensible to try and build a Bayes model based on the available studies. I calculated the total death rate of 0,2% from the available data in April 2020 using the positive test ratios. I created a Bayes model using a population demographic with risk rates and current understanding of immunity and asymptomatic transmission and the effect of vaccinating people who have low risk and it shows that vaccinating people with low risk is complete nonsense.

Accessing hubs can be controlled, in time and density, before going to full lockdown. Likely it is easier to find a less impacting behavior to stop the spreading of agents because the real  nature of social interaction is so complex, and not in spite of it being so complex. Also, if the agents are mostly causing mild symptoms and affect hard only specific groups, these need to be protected more effectively, and there are no strong reasons to enforce countermeasures which have a so large impact on everybody. Few big &quot;central hubs&quot; can be cut off, smaller hubs controlled (basic rules as masks and handwashing, limited accesses on a larger time - the opposite of what is done somewhere), people at higher risk must limit themselves more than others.

I\u2019d believe that the R on every of these types of hot spots is very different, so to determine what kind of event should be allowed at a given phase of a lockdown phase, it would be interesting to simulate them separately. <br>- Rate of infection: I wonder if asymptomatic people (some of the yellow dots in your simulation), are as infectious as those that have symptoms (and sneeze and caught). Not sure how much this would change the simulations though...<br><br>Finally, I have the feeling that mobility is very hard to model accurately. When I look at the concrete cases around me, I see that people do not move socially randomly like mostly made in simulations I\u2019ve seen. Rather, we tend have a large number of contacts inside our immediate family, then a bit less with the colleagues in same the office, finally much less frequently with our friends/sport pals, finally with the rest of the community (in supermarkets, restaurants, bars, etc). In the of the simulations, it\u2019s as if you create another layer of boxes within each community box. Inside those smaller boxes it is very difficult to enforce social distancing, but between them it\u2019s easier to do it (eg close all restaurants and stop sport events, etc). I would expect that one could relax the social distancing rules inside a \u201cmicro box\u201d (eg family, close friends, maybe office colleagues) while enforcing strict rules for other interactions (eg in those social hot spots that I mentioned before) and still get similar results that one obtain by asking every single person to observe strict social distancing to absolutely everyone (outside own\u2019s household). (Off course, risk persons need strict social distancing from everyone, in my opinion).<br>The purpose of all this talk... is that it\u2019s easier for a society to follow some sort of tolerant social rules for a long time rather than very stringent (and certainly very effective) rules. If the rules are very stringent, humans can only follow them for weeks, not months, and start being careless after some time.

So, if someone who has developed antibodies is present, they will take in a portion of the viral load.

It cause adult t cell leukemia a cancer as we know a deadly desease. It has up to 40 years time before symptoms reveal and if its revelead its certainly deadly as cancer is almost incurable. And htlv1 is itself almost incurable. But its disadvantage that it spreads primarily from mothers milk, blood. Its not as innfectious as hiv variants and if it were scientits probably would have thought of antiviral meds specifically for htlv1 to hulting its spread in bodys tissue. Again what about prions that is the closest to perfect infections agent while not being a virus, bacteria, fungi or parasite. It has low infectios rate but high lagged severity rate and almost 100 % letality. Prions as a misfolded proteins are hard to disintegrate since they can withstand high temperatures up to 600 Celcius and high ultraviolet and radition dosage and almost any chemical/surgical disintegrants which were surprising to scientists. Its not infectious as coronavirus because its not airborne. But coronavirus can be disintegrated using chemicals/soap/septics/70% alcohol. In contrast prions according to some studies ( can google up ) can be embeded into plants as well as animals once introduced into soil. It may have from 10 to 50 years for symptoms to develop but once its developed letality is 100 % no cure or vaccines is available. No immune response. Nothing. Immagine it being airborne. Its a nerve/blood borne deasese that utilizes food transmission and blood transfusion. Its literally unkillable. For almost any rna/dna virus you may get vaccine or cure and there is usually an immune response. There is an immune response for fungi, parasite, virus and bacteria. There is antiviral/antibiotics/antifungi and antiparasitic medication. Prions are like heavy metals that poison people, they are not suseptible to ultraviolet/radiation because its a misfolded building block of life like fat or water or calcium metal. Living organisms immune system does not attack water molecules or proteins or fats or metals, even if it does it will have no effect. Antigens can bind to virus so that it wont enter host cell to replicate or immune t cells can destroy virus but immune system cannot destroy water or metal or fat or protein ( or prion ). In that sense it acts like a any other non organic material. Its like heavy metal poisoning, but there is a big but it ( prion ) can replicate itself like a virus. Heavy metal even if it enters the body cannot replicate itself. Scientists shocked in 80s when they discivered that its the only nonorganic infectious agent that can reshape other closely related agents. Its wasnt a replication like you see in biology class about virus, rather microphysics. Now we know there are might be any type of infectious agents be it living or not, be it organic or not it can have different properties like infectious rate, severity rate, letality rate or resistance properties against meds/radiation/temperature/chemicals. There is no guarantee that new ones will have properties that we think or we desire it to have. Something like high resistance, low severity and high lagged letality and high infectivity may wipe living organisms out", "comment_date": "2020-04-15T20:58:12Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "nick argers", "comment_text": "<a href=\"https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1j7411z7KQ/?spm_id_from=333.788.videocard.0\">https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1j7411z7KQ/?spm_id_from=333.788.videocard.0</a>", "comment_date": "2020-04-15T18:33:47Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Plautus Satire", "comment_text": "Cartoons", "comment_date": "2020-04-15T18:25:47Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Ana Paula Figueiredo", "comment_text": "Unfortunately in Brazil, we have a (de)government and the president&#39;s guidelines are in the direction of exterminating citizens, encouraging them to leave their homes.

Your main point of social distancing is not the only correct answer, as you completely left out any discussion of the way the virus is transmitting and contracted. Droplet transmission is the only way to deliver the virus and to receive it. How do we mitigate getting infected by droplet transmission, the main method of infection? \r<br><br><br>By wearing an approved mask that blocks the micrometer droplets from going through and entering the airways. Plus, using gloves so that things touched on the outside, handrails as an example, or train stability bars in subways, are not virus transferred via skin pores.\r<br><br><br>3.

Now in the same breath, if you outfitted the infected with protective clothing that protects other from them, yet allows them to interact safely with others, it is much more risky than isolation but, I would agree that it is a possibility.\r<br><br><br>4.

I think by then all the people getting the infection and incubating with it, then having mild symptoms being spreaders, now show how that simulation our your is so true to the mark of what happens, when a group of society is so undisciplined in the face for an enormous viral danger.\r<br><br><br>The Taiwanese are examples of a people who knew exactly what to do and they did and have not be hit by the huge numbers of infections the rest of the world has seen because they had the playbook, and they went into action as soon as they knew, going as far as advising the WHO that China had an outbreak and would endanger everyone.\r<br><br><br>5. My favorite example to use which is not better than your visual example is, if 10 people were in a room, sized 10x10, and four of the people were infected, and all 10 were masked up and gloved, how many of the safe 6 would become infected by droplet transmission?\r<br>Zero!\r<br><br><br>6. Your demonstration also has not discussed the actually killing of the virus, as it can be killed, with UV light. Now before you get excited, I know the dangers said of UV light, however there is UVc light that does not carry the danger of UV light.\r<br><br><br>UV light is a known coronavirus killer. If a person is contacted long enough for a UV light to damage the skin and the eyes then obviously that is a major consideration, however and a complete warned area that advises to not stand still in the area and to pass through quickly, a strong UV light presence is a very helpful in killing COVID-19 viruses traveling on the outside of clothing and shoes.\r<br><br><br>Additionally, where people linger, those areas can have UVc light, who has a shorter wavelength and does not endanger the skin or eyes, yet does the job in killing microbes in the air.\r<br><br><br>I have been saying now is the time to prepare to get back to work, describing clothing, masks and gloves to reduce the spread of the infection. If there is not transmission of droplets containing the infection, naturally there will be no people getting infected.\r<br><br><br>So, your social distancing is correct, but it is not the only solution in fact, it keeps the people locked up and suppressed longer with little results as you describe, because of the need to go to those area where other people will be.\r<br><br><br>Our governor in NJ has just cut the capacity of marketplace by 50% capacity to have people inside and has done the same with all public transportation, he has become, in my opinion, maniacal in his treatment and examination of the problem and there is no indication where he is getting his information to take these severe draconian measures.\r<br><br><br>So, I hope I have helped the effort a little, I am a captive with many others, and I have little hope that the minds in charge will become enlightened and begin thinking what to do to come out of this. I will say this, no one has talked about isolation, and that is exactly what China did initially at their outbreak, people were forced to go to infection camps.\r<br><br><br>I saw a video of the Chinese authorities and an infectious disease bureaucrat go to a couple\u2019s home to tell then they were near someone who was infected, and as such, they are targeted for isolation. Now this couple were on an airplane with the person, but had been home for 14 days, before these people showed up on their doorsteps. \r<br><br><br>And that was the couple\u2019s arguments, they knew and said we have been home for 14 days and we are fine. The bureaucrat said that you showed up on the metadata, phone record analysis in China, is able to determine proximity of one phone to another, and that is the metadata that pointed out this couple. \r<br><br><br>The couple were told there are assigned to a hotel in Beijing and that a car will come and pick them up at a certain time. This couple resisted, but they were told they have no choice. Now I think they may have had a fear of not ever returning to their home once they are taken away. By the way, the time at the hotel was to be 14 days and if they presented negatively, they would be allowed to return to their home.\r<br><br><br>America is slow and plodding and never should have put microbe doctors in charge of an economy that cannot operate in quarantine. Well, we are all in this together, however some will suffer greater than others, when it all was not necessary, but for this deadly virus.\r<br><br><br>Look at the numbers of tested and confirmed, following the isolation principle how do you isolate those people and for how long? Also a test is soon arriving that can tell is a asymptomatic has the virus, so that person will be confirmed and eligible for isolation. <br><br><br>In China today, in some places you need a clean card to cross from one zone to another, a green card, which means you have tested negative, or you cannot progress from one are to the net, that has started here with edict of volunteering to self-quarantining for 14 days if you come from and infected area. People are recalcitrant and refuse to obey. Isolation is the only true answer as you have described and it is the quickest to eliminate the virus completely, will there be 100% voluntary compliance? No, and so we will have this problem for a long time. As you have shown there are answers to this viral problem.", "comment_date": "2020-04-12T14:40:59Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "vedant dave", "comment_text": "Great work!, Thank you.

People going to the shops still keep their distance from the others, so I&#39;d say the square should be at least 15 infection areas wide(you can turn on/off the social distancing, but the shop shouldn&#39;t be that small).

Of course the probabilities are lower there especially when people now are taking better care of their hygiene but it sill exists. But there is a lot of these scenarios, like writing your pin code at the supermarket or ATM machine, pushing elevator button, or door nobs. Do you think that would be too hard to simulate? Like keeping track of people&#39;s movement and leaving a trace of the virus which can infect others? of course the probability would be way lower than direct contact as you implemented and of course it should be a fading probability. e.g: 10 minutes after the sick person was there is it 0.1% and one day after it is 0.01% and 0 after 2 days maybe.", "comment_date": "2020-04-04T12:03:35Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "bolin Li", "comment_text": "We should avoid the infected risk.

Your video points out the fact that we already know a lot and what to do in dire situations as well as to contain these things before they get out of hand but because of the poor response of several governing bodies and the tepid response of an international agency this has now been unleashed on the planet and may become another annual disease that mutates and infects every year like the flu. Best case scenario is eradication. We have only ever eradicated one disease globally. This is not going to harm wealthy countries, it is going to harm developing countries, like every disease does. We are in this situation not because we were \u201clearning\u201d we are in this situation because a government wanted to maintain the illusion of control and power at the expense of the lives of now thousands of people.", "comment_date": "2020-04-03T12:23:28Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Noyb", "comment_text": "VERY generalized algorithms here...sorry, this only causes panic, destruction of wealth, economies and excuses governments to strip us of rights.", "comment_date": "2020-04-03T12:19:42Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Bill Igoe", "comment_text": "Good simulation, I do wish you could also include the effects on the economy by giving a GDP number to each individual.

Isaiah <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxAaO2rsdIs&amp;t=55m10s\">55:10</a> thru 11, says For as the rain cometh down, and the snow from heaven, and returneth not thither, but watereth the earth, and maketh it bring forth and bud, that it may give seed to the sower, and bread to the eater:<br>So shall My word be that goeth forth out of My mouth: it shall not return unto Me void, but it shall accomplish that which I please, and prosper in the thing whereto I sent it.<br>This means we can pray God&#39;s word and get what we pray for because it&#39;s His word. Psalms <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxAaO2rsdIs&amp;t=18m21s\">18:21</a> says<br>Death and life are in the power of the tongue: and they that love it shall eat the fruit thereof. <br>This means you have whatever you say out of your mouth.<br>Speak only life over yourself, your loved ones and your world.

I believe they are wrong, but would like to know if there is a mathematical way of demonstrating when a country is testing appropiately. <br>Also, considering that it is imposible to test 100% of the population, it is obvious that official COVID confirmed cases reported by government authorities all under estimate the amount of real cases out there.

Sharing to everyone I can.\r<br>\r<br>One of the thigs that concerns me most is the fact that right now we have a number of confirmed cases that is close to 0.01% of the world population. So, we are way before the point where such plots show what we want to see. If we consider the most popular simulations made so far (and that the general public is using as inspiration for this global lock down) only show relevant facts when contamination reaches values in the range of 10%, 50% or 90% of the population and so on, then it\u00b4s clear that we didn\u00b4t even started to really have in practice what we exercised in the models. Not sure if this makes sense, but if things keep their pace, I believe we shall have such numbers near 5 to 6 months from the beginning of 2020. So, middle of the year. But obviously many factors change every day. From government policies around the world to individual practices (collectively and also crazy individuals) and virus genetics, etc everything changes every day.\r<br>\r<br>All real-life variations that we are being submitted to, with all the behavior changes (and their associated risks) will only show if they are really in the right direction when it\u00b4s probably too late to make any turn. The most important thing, I believe, would be to have a clear vision if we are tracking the right path. Is there a way to anticipate such vision? Do you have any comment on this?\r<br>\r<br>Also, luckily, viruses are highly affected by mutations when they reproduce. I read once that the Spanish Flu had such a change and this was what abruptly changed our destiny. Do you think we can model what is the trend? I am sure that high lethality is a bad option for the virus, but the other one (to infect many before getting nasty symptoms) seems to be a practical way to evolve for them.", "comment_date": "2020-03-30T01:31:31Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "dave oneil", "comment_text": "That was brilliant.

The first one is to measure the real R-value. You showed the effect of infected being removed/quarantined after one day. That is not happening well in real life. Plus also ppl don\u2019t show symptoms for over a week if that. Plus there is way more than just one central spot. Run the experiment as follows. Have one blue dot moving around the box and there is say 5 HUB boxes. One is a company staff meeting held daily. Another is a coffee shoppe. Third and fourth is a bus to and from work. The fifth is a fitness gym for daily squats. Now have the blue dot turn red and have it visit the 5 hubs daily and check how the virus is transmitted. Run the simulation which no further transmission meaning the one infected can only get others infected. they don\u2019t spread it further. Run that simulation for 14 days and then see what the R-value is. It&#39;s going to be WAY WAY WAY higher than \u20182\u2019. That value is a joke. Plus you also need to include a way to simulate lingering virus spread. Not only does one infect another with socializing but also through lingering virus left behind. The person may go the coffee shoppe or fitness center and leave, but the virus is still there airborne for an hour and stays on uncleaned surfaces for close to two weeks infecting other blue dots way way way more than that R=2. The second run of the simulation would be with these same parameters but now with the contagion spreading from infected to infected, again for 2 weeks before they are found to be infected and quarantined. How then does the virus spread? This last one is a \u201cRead World\u201d realistic simulation. AH! Now let\u2019s include the travel of the red dot from one box to another without restrictions. Then run the same simulation with restricting travel from box 1 to box 2, between the two boxes 30 days after the first 10 infections are found in box 1. In reality that would be ~44 days after infection. 14 days of patient 0 moving around infecting others, then the 30-day clock starts. Ignore the fact that the infection is already moved to box 2 way before the travel is limited or cut. Then change the simulation to have the travel cut after 1 day of detecting the virus. That is ~15 days from the first infection. it\u2019s a bit much but can you accept this task?", "comment_date": "2020-03-29T18:04:46Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "NeptunianNarwhals", "comment_text": "This is a really excellent video, Grant.

Ergo it would be good to see what would happen if you had a distribution of infection radii over the whole population, to see how this would work (thus one could simulate a society where the majority of people follow social distancing protocols, in contrast to one where most people ignore it).", "comment_date": "2020-03-29T16:58:39Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Micha\u0142", "comment_text": "Amazing work!", "comment_date": "2020-03-29T16:55:25Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Puligesi Tamilarasan", "comment_text": "3b1b getting 1.6Mn views in 1day is the best thing i witnessed in my life.", "comment_date": "2020-03-29T16:53:59Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "smartjocklv", "comment_text": "Shoot this video to the front page!", "comment_date": "2020-03-29T16:46:57Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Michel Raveyts", "comment_text": "6min17 what happens when you add a few susceptiple nurses (low probability) in the quarantine-zone, who travel between the mass and the quarantine.", "comment_date": "2020-03-29T16:45:36Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Sci Fry", "comment_text": "Unfortunately, this pandemic is going to make the history books :(", "comment_date": "2020-03-29T16:42:58Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Lars Menken", "comment_text": "This is amazing video!<br><br>I was really curios to see how travelling between communities affects this all.<br>Would it make a difference if these communities are treating the virus differently?

This virus is unpresented in it&#39;s unbelievably long incubation time, and it&#39;s why standard policies for new viruses haven&#39;t been working. Covid has a contagious incubation window of on average 6 days (and up to two weeks). This means that 100% of people will spread the virus for a week on average before they can &quot;identify and isolate&quot;. I think it&#39;s VERY important to get these details correct because these types of videos spread virally and honest mistakes in modeling can completely distort the final message. (In this case identify and isolate is pointless for any location that has even 1 untraced case). Secondly I&#39;d recommend a more accurate model where groups are not all jiggling, but are instead contained in little &quot;clusters&quot; representing homes. Populations are infected because they go to Central locations and occasionally other homes. But, realistically speaking, my neighbor having covid has very little effect on me getting covid.

But, can this parameter correlate to a late start of quarentine measures, such as it&#39;s happening in the UK or the US?", "comment_date": "2020-03-28T23:03:30Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "VABIS", "comment_text": "how do you animate your videos?<br>Great content by the way!", "comment_date": "2020-03-28T23:00:23Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Cem Saydam", "comment_text": "Send this to every president", "comment_date": "2020-03-28T22:59:45Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Gfx Grafix", "comment_text": "This guy should head the WHO", "comment_date": "2020-03-28T22:59:39Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "xaero76", "comment_text": "This is what Governments/Politicians need to be taught... or in fact have a branch of Government that Steps in and overrides decisions made by Governments/Politicians....", "comment_date": "2020-03-28T22:53:32Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "loveistruth 5*7*", "comment_text": "I&#39;m in the high-risk group.

I loved how you worked on so many different scenarios and combinations of those scenarios. I am writing this from India, where the government has declared absolute lockdown on all business and central hubs. No vehicle movements and nobody is allowed to get out of the house. BUT as you mentioned, TOTAL lockdown is not possible. Stores are open for selling essential commodities. These stores can act as a central hub. However, social distancing is being maintained in those stores. For example, they made circles on the ground where people are supposed to stand while waiting to enter the store or to pay for the stuff they brought. The circles are 1 meter apart. Also, people are aware so as to wash their hands and sanitize their hands periodically. For example, I made a trip to the grocery store yesterday and I was made to sanitize my hand before entering the store and after exiting the store. I sanitized my hands after entering the house and I wore a face mask all the time while outside.<br><br><br>The government is also identifying and isolation all the suspected and confirmed cases. All public transports are stopped. No-one travels anywhere in India currently. Flights, trains, buses you name it. Public awareness is very high. People are avoiding touching each other consciously. I am sure this combination of social distancing, lockdown, isolation the cases will really lower the slope of the curve. I don&#39;t really believe that we will be able to eradicate it, Eventually, everyone will get infected, we are just trying to control the contagion so that the health system is able to treat all the incoming cases.<br><br><br>When I am typing this comment, India has 906 cases and 20 deaths. 83 people have recovered.

For instance, say the virus undergoes a mutation that confers enhanced spreading and severity (greater binding affinity to receptor sites, novel modes of host cell entry, accelerated viral load production, etc.) In which scenario, one being lacking or ineffectual containment measures resulting in a sharp spike and the other being those that &#39;flatten the curve&#39;, does this new variant have a greater chance of gaining a foothold within the host population? Does the rapid spike make it more difficult for such a more severe strain to spread given that there are few remaining susceptible hosts and it essentially has to compete with the older, less severe version of itself? (An exhaustive r-selection) Could flattening the curve actually create an opportunity for the new strain to potentially exceed containment measures geared towards the weaker version, and infect the sizeable portion of susceptibles without any competition of the sort?

Commuting to a central hub is like a store or commonplace is a form of traveling, which your simulation showed produced detrimental effects; however, why wouldn&#39;t travel between states and communities be as extreme? People don&#39;t really randomly transition from one place to another, so, in theory, movement between one community and another can be seen as a central place. <br>4. People don&#39;t have enough test kits to truly identify and isolate everyone that is contaminated: NY&#39;s strategy seems to be faltering, which is essentially that method; there are far too many people to pluck out the right ones in communities, so wouldn&#39;t that have a higher impact on commuting between different ones? If a community isn&#39;t doing enough testing and people are fleeing to there from infected outbreaks since it might be safer, wouldn&#39;t that exponentially drive up the rate?<br>5. Once the cities correctly identify people, how wouldn&#39;t travel restrictions not have a bigger impact? How are you going to correctly identify new asymptomatic people? Wouldn&#39;t it just blow up again like when everyone returned back to their normal life? <br><br><br>It would be interesting to see a simulation where travel restrictions were in place that prevented travel across communities when they had a higher probability of A. Going to denser areas; and B. Being infected. It would also be interesting to see how commuting would factor in tourist attractions and common areas that people visit due to their appeal: I would imagine that this would resemble what is occurring when people were asymptomatic, even to the extent of not taking social distancing seriously, right now.<br><br><br>Restricting travel sounds logical/reasonable and like it would be more effective like anti-cross-contamination measures would be in the food industry. <br><br><br>I think you should reexamine the Travel section, also factoring in how close contact through the traveling might factor into it like on airplanes and buses and cars, where everyone travels together but goes to different locations in the communities. <br><br><br>I feel like downplaying the travel restriction solution when outbreaks are widespread might be detrimental if everyone takes it to heart... It should be revisited to make sure if it&#39;s accurate, I think. <br><br><br><b>UPDATE</b> Also, how would the traveling section do with a greater sampling size in your demonstrated, combined with incorrectly identifying and not testing certain subsections? <br><br>Take Care, With Love Through God and Jesus and The Holy Ghost,", "comment_date": "2020-03-28T03:24:44Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "David Fragoso", "comment_text": "I Don\u2019t comment many times and even less for a praise.

The engine consisted of calculating the location of intersection of the travel path of a dot (which becomes a line given some time delta) and a collision surface (a line). So the problem turns into that of finding the intersection of two lines. EZPZ I thought, I did my deal and coded the formula I derived, build a driver program of a dot enclosed within a square. Surprise surprise, the dots were able to escape through the corners.<br><br>My reasoning is not lucid enough to think of solutions through math models or anything of the like, so what I did is that I stepped through the logic cycle of the algorithm manually as the &quot;event&quot; was close to happening. It didn&#39;t take me long to realize that the problem was that the distance traveled after bouncing on the wall was causing the dot to be placed passed the neighbor wall. I also haven&#39;t fixed the problem yet because I thought it was as easy as repeating the collision detection a few times, but then I realized that this is recursive because if the dot collides with enough force or close enough to the corner of two walls then multiple of this &quot;trespassing collision&quot; (as I called them) would happen.<br><br>I think I found a related article in stackoverflow where the asker was pointed to a blog of a programmer who solved this problem, but both the math and the code was beyond me. All I know is that it is not trivial to solve.<br><br>EDIT: the problem can also happen in straight walls (albeit less often) if acceleration is involved.
