But I&#39;d like to cut the teachers and professors some slack. While studying engineering / applied sciences in Finland it occurred to me that for some reason (I guess it all boils down to money) the time spent in class with one&#39;s teacher has been cut down severely. My past professor actually explained me that since the 90&#39;s the lectures (maths, physics, and the like) have been reduced to 25% of what used to be. Of course 3b1b videos are very concise and to the point, but it would be unreasonable to expect all teachers and professors to come up with such material. Or is it? Is that their job? I don&#39;t really know. I do think that curriculums should be updated rigorously, trying to incorporate new promising methods like this that are emerging throughout the webs.<br><br>My point is, while teachers and professors could be required to come up with solutions like these videos to make the teaching more effective, the real culprits are the decision makers. And of course the times we are living in where everything is valued by it&#39;s efficiency in producing material wealth and this is where it all goes wrong. By cutting down the lectures and challenging students to graduate faster and faster leaves little if any space for innovations to rise, when most of the people lack a basic intuition of what is going on in their field.
