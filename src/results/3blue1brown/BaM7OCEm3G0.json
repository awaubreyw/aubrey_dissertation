Intuitively, this makes sense because the more than 2 vectors don\u2019t line up, the greater the signed area/space between them becomes(hence contributing to the increased value of the cross product)<br><br><b>3)Numerical Meaning:</b><br>The difference in vectors is measured as a product of different dimensions(Example: X x Y), which produces another perpendicular dimension(since perpendicularity, in a sense, represents the extent to which a vector doesn\u2019t line up with another vector). For a simple example consider:\u00a0<br>Example:<br>X x Y = Z:<br>(1,0,0) x (0,1,0) = (0,0,1)<br><br><b>4)Directional Analysis &amp; Why Vector Result:</b><br>              <b>a) +/-:</b><br>If you remember from Grant\u2019s Determinant video, we concluded that the orientation of basis-vectors(\u00ee, \u0135) determines whether a linear transformation reserves space orientation or flips it.\u00a0        <br><br>              <b>b)Directional Implication for Cross Products:</b><br>Based on point 4a), we conclude similarly that cross-products involving x * y * z* x * y * z(as reading from left to right) maintain a positive orientation while x * y * z * x * y * z(as reading from right to left) change to a negative orientation while taking the cross-product:<br>Example(+): (1,0,0) x (0,1,0) = X x Y = (0,0,1)<br><br>Example(-): (0,1,0) x (1,0,0) = Y x X = (0,0,-1)<br><br>              <b>c)Why Vector:</b><br>As seen from 4b), vector cross products are not commutative(since the direction of crossing determines the orientation of our output vector). Differences between two vectors require consideration of not only numerical differences but also orientational differences. Consider this example:<br>Example:\u00a0<br>X x Z != X x Y. We know this because we intuitively understand that Y and Z point in different dimensions, but how can we account for that fact with a singular number? We can\u2019t acknowledge both the difference in magnitude and orientation with a singular number, so we utilize a vector representation instead of a singular scalar as we did with dot products.<br><br><b>5)Ultimate Calculation:</b><br>To find the cross product between 2 vectors, create a third vector of equivalent size. Then fill each dimension(x,y,z) with the combination of differing dimensions(xy, yz, etc.) where orientation(xyzxyz) determines whether you make a positive or negative contribution. This will produce a perpendicular z-vector with a magnitude equal to the signed area of our original two vectors. Example:<br>(1,2,3) x (4,5,6) = (yz - zy, zx - xz, xy - yx) = (2(6)-3(5), 3(4)-1(6), 1(5)-2(4)) = (-3, 6, -3)<br><br><b>End: What this means:</b><br><b>1)</b> The cross product tracks cross-dimensional interactions(how much they don\u2019t line up) between 2-vectors as represented by a new vector orthogonal to our original 2 vectors and with a magnitude equivalent to their signed area.<br><b>2)</b> Cross products use a vector to track changes in magnitude and orientation! Dot products use a scalar to track overlap between two vectors as a singular number<br><b>3)</b> The determinant calculates the signed area of our original two vectors, allowing us to find the magnitude of the cross product between them.", "comment_date": "2022-07-25T16:40:12Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "B0scov", "comment_text": "I think this might make more sense if there was an animation showing how those 2 vectors collapse into the number line.

Two ways:<br>(1) just take determinant of the 3 vectors:  det([X V W])<br>(2) (parallelogram base) area \u00d7 (perpendicular) height: det([V W]) \u00d7 (perpendicular) height <br>This can be represented by the dot product P\u00b7X.  Why? Recall that P here is the vector that has two properties, it is perpendicular to the parallelogram V and W, and it happens to also have the length equivalent to det([V W]). And also recall that taking dot product A\u00b7B, is to make a 1D transformation of B onto A, such that we can have &#39;comparable&#39; length of B to A, and then multiply this length to length(A). So imagine we have a vector X, taking dot product P\u00b7X means we project X onto the perpendicular vector to get the length of the projected X, which is essentially the (perpendicular) height, and then we multiply this height with the length of P, which as aforementioned equals to det([V W]). Hence, P\u00b7X=height (length of projected X) \u00d7 area (length of P which equals to det([V W])).<br><br>So back to the concept of cross product,<br>V \u00d7 W = P <br>Cross product is to spit out the perpendicular vector of length det([V W]) that enable you to calculate the volume of parallelepiped involving any vector with constant vectors V and W. <br><br>The above question can be formulated to below:<br>P \u00b7 X = det([X  V  W ])<br>find the P that enables you to calculate volume of the parallelepiped.<br>If you work this thing out, finding the coordinates of P can reduce to <br>p1 = v2.w3-v3.w2<br>p2 = v3.w1-v1.w3<br>p3 = v1.w2-v2.w1<br>Which is why V (cross product) W can be calculated by ihat(v2.w3-v3.w2)+jhat(v3.w1-v1.w3)+khat(v1.w2-v2.w1)  ...... these ihat jhat and khat are just to pinpoint the coordinates.", "comment_date": "2020-08-17T07:47:47Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Patch Thomas", "comment_text": "This video makes me want to donate via patreon.", "comment_date": "2020-08-13T18:39:52Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "kim yumi", "comment_text": "<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BaM7OCEm3G0&amp;t=6m34s\">6:34</a> <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BaM7OCEm3G0&amp;t=10m23s\">10:23</a>", "comment_date": "2020-08-11T06:39:44Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Akmin Kurai", "comment_text": "how do i-hat, j-hat and k-hat relate to a single vector with the coordinates x y z?

It has nothing to do with plugging in but rather once you understand what p should be, the determinant computation places the unit vector components to the correct places to represent p. The possible motivation illuminating how one could arrive at this connection on their own could be: I want to find a vector that is perpendicular to two other vectors. What do I know to find such a thing. Well if I multiply the parallelogram formed by some height I get a parallelepiped. Ah well that means I have some arbitrary x,y,z vector that forms this parallelepiped. Ok so in relation to this new vector, &lt;x,y,z&gt;, the perpendicular height is some projection of &lt;x,y,z&gt;, onto some other perpendicular vector, we will call it P. What do I know that could help me find such a P. Well, the determinant of the vectors forming the parallelepiped is a constant. And I know that the dot product of two vectors is a constant. So lets define P as the vector that taken as the dot product with &lt;x,y,z&gt; (because I was already thinking about it projecting x,y,z onto the height) to equal the determinant.

One way to think about this is to ask if you lived in flatland, could you drive your race car around the track. If vector algebra is used, the answer is no, since angular momentum requires the cross-product, which is only in three dimensions.

But I did some writing on paper (and some looking around online), and it finally occurred to me that the reason it is perpendicular, is that plugging in the coordinates of v into x, y, and z will return a zero determinant for that function you defined, and so will plugging in the coordinates of w. This would imply that, if the determinant is 0, then the dot product of p and v and that of p and w will also be 0. Since p is non-zero, and v is non zero, then we can take the equation given by the dot product, (p dot v) = (abs(p)) * (abs(v)) * cos(theta)). cos(theta) MUST be 0 to satisfy this, therefore theta must be 90 degrees or pi/2 radians, hence it is perpendicular to v, and therefore perpendicular to w.<br><br><br>Took me 10 watches of this video, but I&#39;m glad it got me to think a little bit about the relevance of duality with all of this.

Consider k for example. The parallelepiped defined by k (and v and w) has volume equal to its height (1) multiplied by the area of its cross section in the x-y plane. The components of v and w in this plane are just (v1, v2) and (w1, w2), giving an area of v1w2 - v2w1. So this is the third (k) component of the map / the dual vector.

Of course, because of what we saw in the first videos on linear transformations, p1 is where i-hat lands after the transformation, so it is L(i-hat). In the same fashion, p2 must be L(j-hat) and p3 must be L(k-hat).<br><br><br>This way it turns out that p1 must be the determinant of the matrix (which we will call &quot;A&quot;) where the first column is i-hat, the second column is v and the third is w (as that&#39;s the definition of L in the video).<br><br><br>But i-hat is [1 0 0]^t, so turns out p1=v2w3 - v3w2 - the other (four) terms you&#39;d get by computing the determinant .tragically die because of the zeroes.<br><br><br>The same applies when we put j-hat as input variable: j-hat is [0 1 0]^t, so four terms die and two survive. Same old story for k-hat, which is [0 0 1]^t.<br><br><br>Putting i-hat in the same place where i-hat&#39;s &quot;1&quot; component would be and formally computing, obviously makes i-hat being multiply by the correct (scalar) expression.

The thing is: I was not convinced that the geometric interpretation of the transformation leads to a direct conclusion that p has to be both perpendicular to the base of the v,w parallelogram with the length equal to its base. The reason is: such a vector is a candidate for p, but is it the only possible option? Are there others vectors that could, coincidentally have their dot product with [x y z] be equal to the volume of that parallelepiped. The answer is: no, there are no other possibilities (keep in mind that p has to be able to fulfill the criteria for any given [x y z]), and the reason is: focus on arbitrary [x y z] and vary it&#39;s orientation in space while preserving its length. The dot product depends on the angle between [x y z] and p, but at the same time, the volume of the parallelepiped depends on the angle between [x y z] and the normal to the base parallelogram. For the equality to hold for any [x y z], it must be that p is in the same direction as the normal to the base parallelogram so the both dot product and the determinant depend on the same parameter, as they are always equal. Once this is realized, it is easy to reason why the length of p has to be equal to the area of the base parallelogram.", "comment_date": "2019-04-18T18:31:44Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "carrapaz", "comment_text": "<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BaM7OCEm3G0&amp;t=1m04s\">1:04</a> shouldn&#39;t j^ be (v1w3-v3w1)?", "comment_date": "2019-04-11T14:19:39Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Eric Ma", "comment_text": "How many linear transformations to the number line are there?

This is the opposite of the dot product which has a magnitude defined as:<br> |v| |w| Cosine Theta <br>which in essence is a measure of the commonality of the vectors v and w. So the cross product itself defines the dimensions in space of a vector which combines the components of v and w which are acting perpendicular to each other.

So the question is : &quot;how can I construct a vector which represent an oriented element of surface (to calculate the flux for exemple) ?&quot;<br><br>1) The first way is to build it from the basic vector (i,j,k) by setting the following rules :<br>i x j = - j x i = k , j x k = - k x j = i , k x i = - i x k = j (so i x i = j x j = k x k = 0) which gives you the good orientation and the good surface for the basic vectors, and we take the cross product ...x... to be linear on each side to allow you to extend this &quot;good properties for basic vectors&quot; to any linear combinaison of the basic vectors (thus extending it to any vectors).<br><br>This set of rules has all the good properties and allow me to find the vector I want from any pair of vectors like this :<br>(a.i+b.j+c.k) x (d.i+e.j+f.k) = ad(i x i) + ae(i x j) + af(i x k) + bd(j x i) + be(j x j) + bf(j x k) + cd(k x i) + ce(k x j) + cf(k x k)<br>= ae(k) + af(-j) + bd(-k) + bf(i) + cd(j) + ce(-i) = (bf - ce)i + (cd - af)j + (ae - bd)k       which is the classical formula<br><br>2) The second way is to decompose it with respect to each direction of space.<br>If I have two vectors perpendicular to the vector i, I want their cross product to be collinear to i and to have a length equal to the oriented surface formed by the two vectors. I know a number which can represent an oriented surface, its just the determinant of the two vectors ! So in this case, their cross product is just the determinant of the two vectors times i.<br><br>For two vectors (0, b, c) and (0, e, f), this gives us : (0, b, c) x (0, e, f) = det([(b,c),(e,f)]).i = ((bf - ce), 0, 0)<br><br>Now I can apply the same reasoning to vectors perpendicular to j or k, and thanks to the linearity of the cross product I can sum up every contribution, which gives us : (a, b, c) x (d, e, f) = ((bf - ce), (cd - af), (ae - bd)) again the same formula<br><br>This last approach can be used for higher dimensions, and is used for example in electrodynamics (electromagnetism + special relativity) to define a 4D vector which characterize a &quot;3D surface&quot;.<br><br>Forword : the important things are the properties of the cross product, and its the only thing that matters for any mathematical tool. Here we have :<br>- anti-symetry : U x V = - V x U<br>- bilinearity (linearity to the right and to the left)<br>- transform two vectors to one vector<br><br>Bilinearity gives &quot;area like&quot; properties ( area of a square of length 2a : (a + a)(a + a) = a\u00b2 + a\u00b2 + a\u00b2 + a\u00b2= 4a\u00b2 ).<br>Anti-symetry gives &quot;algebraic numbers like&quot; properties (the order matters).<br>Bilinearity+anti-symetry gives &quot;algebraic area like&quot; properties, just like the determinant.<br>The third property is about orientation. Determinant associate two vectors to give a number, whereas cross product gives a vector. To form a vector we need a length, an orientation and a sign. The determinant gives us the length and the sign, so we need to add an orientation to have a vector. You can see how these things come into play in the two proofs I gave.<br><br>These properties are also useful to define vectors that represents a rotation (something to do with how to transform such a vector when we reflect everything with respect to the plane of rotation, see pseudo-vectors) and to work with it.
