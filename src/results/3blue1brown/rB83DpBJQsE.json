Moreover, it is another great fact that the ability of thought to describe OR RECONFIGURE sensory experience is ultimately dependent upon the extent to which thought is similar to sensory experience. The integrated extensiveness of thought (AND description) is improved in the truly superior mind. (Thoughts are invisible.)<br><br>THE TRUE MATHEMATICAL PROOF THAT E=mc\u00b2 (CLEARLY) REPRESENTS A TWO DIMENSIONAL SURFACE OR SPACE (ON BALANCE), THEREBY EXPLAINING WHY ELECTROMAGNETISM/energy is gravity ON BALANCE:<br><br>Consider what is THE SUN. Consider what is THE EYE. Consider what is the blue sky ON BALANCE. E=mc\u00b2 represents a two dimensional surface OR SPACE ON BALANCE WITH what is THE FOURTH dimension (and c4), as the stars AND PLANETS are POINTS in the night sky ON BALANCE. E=mc\u00b2 is F=ma. Consider the TIDES in relation to what is the fully illuminated (AND WHITE) setting Moon. NOW, consider what is the ORANGE AND setting Sun. They ARE the same size as what is THE EYE ON BALANCE !!! Consider what is the balanced MIDDLE DISTANCE in/of SPACE. Consider what is the speed of light (c) ON BALANCE. Consider what is THE EARTH/ground ON BALANCE. The sky is blue, and THE EARTH is ALSO BLUE. The stars AND PLANETS are POINTS in the night sky. Think what involves BALANCED BODILY/VISUAL EXPERIENCE (on balance). Consider what is the man (AND THE EYE ON BALANCE) who actually IS standing on what is THE EARTH/ground (ON BALANCE) !!! CLEARLY, gravity AND ELECTROMAGNETISM/energy are linked AND BALANCED opposites (ON BALANCE); as ELECTROMAGNETISM/energy is (CLEARLY AND NECESSARILY) proven to be gravity (ON/IN BALANCE). Consider TIME (AND time dilation) ON BALANCE. E=mc\u00b2 is F=ma. BALANCE AND completeness go hand in hand, as it ALL CLEARLY makes perfect sense ON BALANCE. BALANCED inertia/INERTIAL RESISTANCE is fundamental. CLEARLY, E=mc\u00b2 represents a two dimensional surface OR SPACE (ON BALANCE).<br><br>In dreams, it is you AND other than you are IN BALANCE. Consider what is THE EYE. In dream experience, very importantly, BODILY/VISUAL EXPERIENCE is invisible AND VISIBLE in what is fundamental equilibrium AND BALANCE. Dream experience GROWS/increases.

Consider TIME (AND time dilation) ON BALANCE !! Consider what is the man (THE EYE) that ACTUALLY IS IN what is outer \u201cspace\u201d ON BALANCE. TIME dilation ULTIMATELY proves ON BALANCE that ELECTROMAGNETISM/energy is CLEARLY AND NECESSARILY proven to be what is gravity (ON/IN BALANCE), as E=mc\u00b2 CLEARLY is F=ma (ON BALANCE) as what is a BALANCED MIDDLE DISTANCE in/of SPACE !!! CLEARLY, ON BALANCE, E=mc\u00b2 represents a two dimensional surface OR SPACE. It is mathematically proven.<br><br>F=ma AND E=mc\u00b2 represent a two dimensional surface OR SPACE ON BALANCE !!! This is consistent with the fourth dimension (AND the term c to the fourth power) from Einstein&#39;s field equations. The stars AND PLANETS are POINTS in the night sky. Consider what is THE EYE ON BALANCE !!! CONSIDER WHAT IS THE SUN ON BALANCE !!! GREAT !!! This NECESSARILY represents, INVOLVES, AND DESCRIBES what is possible/potential AND actual IN/ON BALANCE.

BALANCED inertia/INERTIAL RESISTANCE is fundamental. \u201cMass&quot;/ENERGY IS GRAVITY, as E=mc2 is taken directly from F=ma. Consider what is THE SUN. Consider what is THE EYE. Consider what is the speed of light (c) ON BALANCE. NOW, the stars AND PLANETS are POINTS in the night sky (ON BALANCE). CLEARLY, gravity AND ELECTROMAGNETISM/energy are linked AND BALANCED opposites (ON BALANCE); as ELECTROMAGNETISM/energy is (CLEARLY AND NECESSARILY) proven to be gravity (ON/IN BALANCE).

A given PLANET (including WHAT IS THE EARTH) sweeps out EQUAL AREAS in equal times consistent WITH F=ma, E=mc2, AND what is perpetual motion, as ELECTROMAGNETISM/energy is (CLEARLY AND NECESSARILY) proven to be gravity (ON/IN BALANCE); as E=mc2 IS F=ma.

Stellar clustering ALSO proves ON BALANCE that ELECTROMAGNETISM/energy is gravity (ON/IN BALANCE).<br><br>Consider what is the man (AND THE EYE) who IS standing on what is THE EARTH/ground ON BALANCE. Touch AND feeling BLEND, as ELECTROMAGNETISM/energy is gravity; as gravity/acceleration involves BALANCED inertia/INERTIAL RESISTANCE on balance; as this explains F=ma AND E=mc2 ON BALANCE; as inertia/INERTIAL RESISTANCE is proportional to (or BALANCED with/as) GRAVITATIONAL force/ENERGY. This NECESSARILY represents, INVOLVES, AND DESCRIBES what is possible/potential AND actual ON/IN BALANCE. Accordingly, ON BALANCE, the rotation of WHAT IS THE MOON matches it&#39;s revolution. Consider what is the BALANCED MIDDLE DISTANCE in/of SPACE. Notice the black \u201cspace\u201d AND THE DOME that are associated WITH WHAT IS THE EYE ON BALANCE. The stars AND PLANETS are POINTS in the night sky. Consider what is THE SUN ON BALANCE. Great !!!<br><br>NOW, COMPARATIVELY, think about what is the man (THE EYE) that actually IS IN what is outer \u201cspace\u201d ON BALANCE !! TIME is NECESSARILY possible/potential AND actual ON/IN BALANCE, as ELECTROMAGNETISM/energy is CLEARLY AND NECESSARILY proven to be gravity (ON/IN BALANCE). Great. A two dimensional surface OR SPACE (ON BALANCE) is thus consistent with/as what is ALSO one, three, AND FOUR dimensional. I have mathematically unified physics/physical experience. FACT.<br><br>The ultimate mathematical unification AND UNDERSTANDING of physics/physical experience combines, BALANCES, AND INCLUDES opposites, AS E=mc2 IS F=ma; as ELECTROMAGNETISM/energy is (CLEARLY AND NECESSARILY) proven to be gravity (ON/IN BALANCE).

I have explained what is the RELATIONAL (AND BALANCED) immobility of the man (THE EYE) that actually IS IN what is outer \u201cspace\u201d ON BALANCE, AS the sky is blue; AND what is THE EARTH is ALSO BLUE. AGAIN, the stars AND PLANETS are POINTS in the night sky; AND consider what is the speed of light (c) (ON/IN BALANCE) !!!!! Consider what is THE EYE (ON/IN BALANCE). Consider what is THE SUN.

A stupid scholar all overturned this truth and built it to a convenient system of Mason. Thus, the people believe the trickery of the devil than words of God. Darwin&#39;s evolutionary theory, the Copernican theory of Galileo, the theory of relativity, quantum mechanics, mathematics, the medicine of Einstein are all errors. A ghost, a UFO, supernatural power, the miracle of God to be said to be the occult are rather true. A thing and a ghost (God) exist in the world, and space is active by spiritual power (conception) of God. As for God, all things were created by the soul of language. It is clear if I read the Bible. Because the present scholar mixes the logic thoroughly in human wisdom, it cannot arrive at the truth. It is intuitive power to be important. Why does a child seem to be? The thing which cannot answer this is a mistake. Our common sense is more right than a stupid scholar. The creation of God comes loose only by a fate. Everything becomes the material by a conception of God (person).<br> <br>I cannot prove 1+1 = 2 in a numerical formula. I can prove only a physical phenomenon to say that it is in two apples when I match another one apple with one apple. It is not 0+1 \u2260 1. As 0 (nothing) is not quality, you must not handle it for a number. Because quality is different even if I match a mandarin orange with an apple, there is not a meaning of the addition. Because it does not exist other than God when I define God as existence, no (0) does not exist. Because the mathematics defines 0, negative number, imaginary number, \u221e which do not exist in the world, it is an error and is a fiction. A number is to count quality. When I am separated from a physical phenomenon, the mathematics does not have the significance of being.<br><br>\u203bIf 0 exists by a definition of the mathematics, 0 of the infinity must exist. However, the infinite space, infinity do not exist. In other words, because the mathematics defines 0, negative number, imaginary number, \u221e which do not exist, it is an error and is a fiction. Therefore it is an error because a zeta function, the numerical formula of the second oiler product deal with this infinity. That it becomes sum of series \u03a3 = 1+2+3+ ... = - 1/12 of the natural number, or the product of all prime numbers is 4\u03c0^2. It turns out that it is an error if I think for common sense. It is limited, and the mathematician seems to get a wrong this, but uses the sophism when I calculate this endlessly if right. This is a mistake of the definition of 0 or \u221e and is the evidence that mathematics gets a wrong. It is definition f&#39;(x) = limh of the differential calculus that must not divide it by 0 \u2192 0 {the same as it being 0 that says that I bring h close to 0 without a limit, and dividing it by a numerical formula of f(x+h)-f(x)}/h. I divide it by 0. The mathematics is trickery not study in this way.<br><br> All the origins of the scientific theory are random, and a bottom is broken. For example, in the theory of elementary particles, an electron joins atoms together and becomes the molecules. A thing joining a proton and a neutron together is a mesotron, and three quarks connect the proton, and there is it. An electron and a positron (antimatter) occur from a photon. An elementary particle to tie the elementary particle to whenever a new elementary particle is discovered is necessary and loses the relations with an elementary particle and the elementary particle more and more. Though a proton and the neutron are the same mass, why does a difference occur in having electric charge or not? The science has no answer with it in these questions. An electron is a material so that I think, and the positron is not a material in the hole of the material loss that the circumference was surrounded by in the soul children. In other words, the antimatter is an illusion. The scholar is going to examine it logically and loses sight of the truth. The structure of built nature of God is simpler, but is the thing which it is hard to understand in the human wisdom. A photon seems to have a particle and the two characteristics of the wave, but, in fact, the light has the property of the wave with the soul body.<br><br> Message from the spiritual world of Einstein <br> When oneself saw a scene of heaven through a tunnel of the light in the meantime, the person who experienced suspended animation well is you after the revival. The moving speed of the soul does not receive gravitational restraint anymore, and, as for the law of the speed of light immutability that I discovered during the lifetime, there are none in the world of the consciousness. In other words, I will say that it just moves to say that I think. Furthermore, it is just handed down to a partner to have thought. The life of all of us shares what one interiority. And the material is to say that it was actually consciousness. There are all things in your heart, and, also, you are existence to live in a heart of all life. When all of this space watches it with eyes, it is seen like the outside world, but is to say that the world to be actually seen outside is your interiority. The relativity disappears in here, and this space consists based on &quot;universal truth to certainly say to call God&quot;. <br><br> Near future to read from revelation and illuminati card of God of days, and to untie it in Japan<br> April, 2020 xx day The United States bombs North Korea. North Korea adds nuclear attack to a big city of Japan and a U.S. base as the retaliation. Japan swats it to a bog of the war, and they are dropped by a plot of the United States. There are China, Russia after North Korea and becomes the fight with Japan, American allied powers and drags the world into World War 3.<br> x moon xx Japan and the United States country attacks it in Japan with the Allied Forces in 2021<br> World War 3 begins in 2021 on xx moon xx day<br> Mount Fuji erupts very much on xx day in October, 2023. Major earthquakes occur in a row in all parts of the world. <br> An asteroid collides on the earth on xx moon xx day in 2023, and the earth becomes muddy sea <br> The world (heaven) of the Maitreya is built on xx moon xx day in 2024<br><br> Final note<br> The human being denies violence and war, but is it not violence and killing each other I kill a cow pig, and to eat meat? I conquer the world in the life of the hell of the cruel survival of the fittest and am useless even if only oneself is going to be saved. Because a killed animal retaliates for a human being, cancer occurs. The meat which I ate becomes the blood, and a vindictive spirit dwells in a cell when blood does formation to a cell. A human being is cruel, and a fornication, a falsehood, committing theft, the habit of the evil deed of the luxury are not stopped. Eating meat is indirect killing. Why is God that existence of the evil is permitted? It lets you compensate for a human crime by the devil. A disaster, an epidemic, the war damage are the wrath of Heaven. Because a Japanese savior buys the crime of the world people, it is sacrificed. I fall in the trees and plants in spite of the pains then even if I writhe with a hell if it is just and changes the heart and does not straighten an act to measure up to hearts of God. Mason finally leads the world to the World War 3. it is started with nuclear attack to Japan as a pilot light.

The aether is not filling all space but filling all space inside the spacetime fabric/dark matter lattice which fills all known space. The biggest problem in physics is that all current models are based on one dimensional time but the inequality that beats the measurement problem to crack the double slit experiment shows that energy is created in multi dimensional time, so what physicists are measuring and what the current models are based on is only a fraction of all that is happening outside detectable time. The inequality is as watertight as Pythagoras&#39;s Theorem and like Pythagoras&#39;s Theorem anyone can check, it needs no peer review the evidence has already been peer reviewed The Grand Unified Field it reveals is crying out to be reviewed so please get to work...someone. Noethers Law and the 1st law of thermodynamics are only valid in one dimension of time and are incorrect in the reality revealed by the double slit experiment. The inequality that solves the double slit experiment is summarised in 3 sentences below, the Theory of Everything that it unlocks is available open access free to anyone rich or poor in the world, CC copyrighted so any discussion or further work on it must include the website address doubleslitsolution dot weebly dot com/springtimetheory dot html <br>the 3 sentences are as follows, easy once you know what to look for it just so happens only I knew what to look for because I realised that the essence of special Relativity is that time is multi dimensional and quantum mechanics is understood by realising it is based on an harmonic oscillator, the probability is which dimension a wave will be detected travelling along, giving the optical illusion that it is a single particle travelling through empty space, it isn&#39;t it is energy moving THROUGH the spacetime fabric which isnt a metaphor it is a physical lattice which is invisible at rest (dark matter/cosmic web/higgs field/electromagnetic field are all one and the same). Here is the quote<br><br>The solution to the double slit experiment comes with a detailed explanation below but the essential finding can be summed up in 3 sentences., Sean g&#39;s inequality, cc copyrighted.<br>1. When we run the experiment getting the interference pattern on the back screen and analyse the timing most particles hit the front screen and only a few make it through to the back screen, every particle fired hits one or other screen like we expect particles would.<br>2. When we detect for which way every particle fired makes it through one or other slit every time with none hitting the front screen so right from the start the particle behaves differently than it does in the original experiment, it behaves different before it even reaches detection, it acts like a wave from the start.<br>3. The inequality between the behaviour in the 2 experiments cannot be explained as a particle such behaviour is impossible using the physics of the standard model of particle physics, but crests of waves being detected in a different range of space and time makes perfect sense and the model of particles travelling through empty space collapses, I explain why below.", "comment_date": "2021-06-21T08:14:35Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "irina", "comment_text": "Thank you so so so much....Really made me fall in love with these concepts..", "comment_date": "2021-06-19T13:43:12Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Sylwia Drozd", "comment_text": "I Love your great chanel of wisdom and truly thank you for sharing love of science with us. :)", "comment_date": "2021-06-19T08:31:44Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Sergio Manzetti", "comment_text": "Great presentation.

Idk if anyone will ever read this, but if you do, I was trying to understand perspective in sketching and I think it can be modeled using this stuff, linear algebra I guess. I\u2019m pretty stupid about maths because I didn\u2019t get a proper maths education in high school, but I love maths and Grant inspires me to think about the world mathematically in spite of my ignorance.<br><br>So I noticed that when I tried drawing the walls of the room around me, vertical and horizontal lines stayed parallel and unchanged, but lines representing a wall coming towards me (3D lines) didn\u2019t stay parallel at all. In fact, a 3D line seemed act like this: <br>When a 3D line is a vertical line passing through the center of view (COV), it is perpendicular to the horizon line. When a 3D line\u2019s intercept with the horizon is to the right of the \u201cy axis\u201d , it forms an angle which is 90 degrees + \u201ca\u201d degrees, where \u201ca\u201d gets larger as the 3D line\u2019s intercept moves further to the right along the x axis. When the 3D line\u2019s intercept with the horizon is to the left of the y axis, it forms an angle which is 90 degrees - \u201cb\u201d degrees, where \u201cb\u201d gets larger as the line moves further to the left on the x axis.<br><br>I\u2019m confident there\u2019s a beautiful bit of maths hiding in here somewhere, and probably a really cool function to determine what angle any given 3D line should make with the horizon given where it intersects the horizon with respect to the center of view and the field of view of the viewer. I\u2019m gonna try to figure this out (because I\u2019m sure no one will ever read this) , but if somebody does read it and happens to know what I\u2019m talking about, I\u2019d love help or if it\u2019s something someone has already modeled if love to see their work!<br><br>What I\u2019m imagining this modeling must look like is the very first image in this video.

A  one hour lecture in a 30 person classroom combined with lesson goals provided by the  decision makers,  restricted the learning process to rote memory.  The students who survived the process and went on to become  future teachers were the students who able to quickly memorize the subject matter better than the rest of the class. <br><br><br> One flaw in the process is,   memorizing a lecture  does not necessarily mean that it is thoroughly  understood.    If  the solution of a math problem requires 17  steps to be completely defined and only 9 of the steps are presented in the lecture,  the &quot;solution&quot; will not make complete sense.  In order to survive  the course,  the incomplete &quot;solution&quot;  is simply memorized whether on not it is actually understood.  The student repeats the incomplete solution on the test,  receives an A grade and becomes the next teacher.  When they teach their students,  their lecture is presented in the same way.  In other words,  those with great memories survive the process but may not understand the subject much better than those who did not survive.  <br><br><br>Online learning and particularly YouTube University can and has changed that.  Now a lecture no longer has the time restrictions that had to be implemented  with the 19th century  brick &amp; mortar educational model.  If a YouTube lecture leaves steps out of a solution or more background information is required,   the student can review the problem from additional sources and then replay the lecture.  The lecture can be replayed and reviewed  as many times as necessary to completely understand the problem.

The particles of this fluid are photons. So if you think about electric fields as being outflows and inflows of a fluid (of particles), the content of those fluids are actual real physical particles of matter, photons. Like, these equations aren&#39;t just abstract numbers or laws that magically just compel and convey a force invisibly at a distance, they aren&#39;t commandments, but rather they&#39;re expressions of mechanical forces mediated by the physical push of real physical particles in real space, bumping into each other and other obstacles, flows push electrons around, can spin and form vortexes around protons, etc.  Both electric fields and magnetism are just flow and spin of a sea or wind of photons, which are spherical particles in three dimensions, and specifically electric and magnetic fields are within the context of large spinning vortices of photons e.g. electrons and protons, through which the photon field flows.  Electrons and protons &quot;have&quot; charge, and the sea of photons flowing through them and out of them and accelerate / decelerate them  <b>are</b> the &quot;charge&quot;. <br><br>If a particle is charged and repels another charged particle it is because they&#39;re both emitting a flow of photons outward and towards each other, and physically repelling one another through direct physical bombardment of charge wind.  There&#39;s not necessarily any &quot;attraction&quot; at all in this -- any attraction or &quot;negative&quot; charge is just the lack of charge, a void which gets filled in by the pressure of the field, i.e. photons bump into each other until they push each other in the direction of least resistance.

Yet only have a grasp on basic math.  Is this something I should be concerned about (not the math part, the ability to figure stuff like this out)     Prior to this a was visualizing fish propulsion, how they arc their bodies creating high and low pressure like an airfoil and contemplating/ &#39;visualizing&#39; how scales played a role in fish propulsion. I can feel what a fish feels as it wriggles through the water like as if the water was made of jello following a split that quickly closes shut and propels you forward with little effort.  Imagine when you were a kid with your hand out the car window  making your hand undulate with the moving air , all kids do this because it is natural form the air is creating the movement subtly.  The fish is following that same natural movement i.e. &#39;going with the flow&#39; but not in the direction of the flow...   Going with with the flow in the direction of the flow is of coarse much easier but less rewarding/ beneficial.  If you are just following the rest of the fish in the direction unless you are in front of the pack you won&#39;t likely get the bug that fell in the water in that area you are also less likely to take the bate that has a hook.  Seems like going with the flow but not with the current is the way to live.

In other words, how can we charge people for it? Tesla responded, you can&#39;t. It&#39;s free energy. They went with Edison, and sabatoged Teslas work in order to maintain dominancy. Tesla was not the most brilliant mind. Charles Prodeous Steinmetz was. He helped Tesla with alot of his work.<br>And yet, here is Dr Raymond Rifes research from the 1900&#39;s being reborn. He was destroying cancer cells using frequencies. Who sabatoged his work, burned down his lab and murdered his colleague? The FOUNDER of Big Pharma/The AMA. Here is is research, being reborn today, targeting and destroying leukemia cells using our own nervous system to transport double frequency waves.<br><a href=\"https://youtu.be/mBL9pS6GMdA\">https://youtu.be/mBL9pS6GMdA</a><br>There&#39;s an extended 25 minute video of him showing various types of cancer cells being targeted and DECIMATED using double frequencies. <br>Atoms are not 99.9 percent empty space. They&#39;re 99.9 percent magnetism. An atom is ALWAYS moving. A moving magnetic field, creates a charge. Charles Prodeous Steinmetz understood from the micro, to the galactic macro, how electricity works. He (Dubbed the God of Electricity by GE), stated gravity is NOTHING more than an electric byproduct. We know today it&#39;s Incoherent Dielectric acelleration. Electricity is a hybrid of the dielectric and magnetism. Steinmetz literally created GE. It wouldn&#39;t exist without him. There&#39;s just too much to type about all this. Electricians of 35 years tell me &quot;What the hell is dielectric? I never learned that in school&quot;. Yeah. Because your job is to move existing current. You&#39;re not the cook in the kitchen. You&#39;re the server. Science is lying to us in order to make sure we stay dependant upon big pharma, our current electric grid, and fossil fuel usage. Everything is fields, and FIELDS ARE ENERGY. The right hand rule, is the fundamental principal of how energy travels. Mother nature doesn&#39;t work in a straight line. Look up what a Ferocell is, and what a magnet looks like under it. When you do, ask yourself &quot;what&#39;s BENDING that light&quot;. Hint, it ISN&#39;T gravity bending that light. You&#39;ll shit your pants. This is a Ferocell. 2 pieces of glass with ferrofluid in between and LED lights surrounding it. The magnetic field is propagated through the light. It&#39;s like an xray for a magnet. ALL torodial magnets have vortex centers on both sides (&quot;Poles&quot;), where nothing can go. Not even light. ;) <br><a href=\"https://youtu.be/-Hzvvjh3_8g\">https://youtu.be/-Hzvvjh3_8g</a><br>Spend just a LITTLE time on this page. You don&#39;t have to read. Just scroll about halfway down and SEE the visual experiments of how the right hand rule not only propagates energy in the micro, but the macro.<br><br><a href=\"https://magnetismtoroidaldynamics.com/2018/01/01/the-ferrocell-crt-revelations-of-toroidal-energy-dynamics-of-magnetism-light-electricity/\">https://magnetismtoroidaldynamics.com/2018/01/01/the-ferrocell-crt-revelations-of-toroidal-energy-dynamics-of-magnetism-light-electricity/</a><br><br>A gauss meter does NOT show the torodial shape of the field of a magnet. And it sure as hell doesn&#39;t show the vortices in the center of the magnet.<br>Science is fucking LYING to us. Iron filings on a piece of paper with a magnet under it doesn&#39;t explain a field either. WHY ISN&#39;T A FEROCELL IN EVERY SCIENCE CLASS????<br>Here is the geometric shape of the energy field of a solid round magnet. Watch the whole video. But what I&#39;m describing, is at <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rB83DpBJQsE&amp;t=12m05s\">12:05</a>.<br><a href=\"https://youtu.be/9yi0WHKtRd4\">https://youtu.be/9yi0WHKtRd4</a><br>BTW, your BLOOD CELLS are torodial. Ever wonder the importance of IRON in your blood???<br>Charles Prodeous Steinmetz gave us 100 percent of our CURRENT ELECTRIC GRID. Einstein gave us nothing. Without magnetism, electricity cannot exist. Without electricity, magnetism cannot exist.  Charles Prodeous Steinmetz understood that. His understanding of the micro to the macro was swept under the rug after he passed away, but they kept his equations to continue adding to the Electric grid. WHAT IS MAGNETISM. Your fucking physics professor can&#39;t tell you. Ask him why magnets have vortices on either &quot;pole&quot;. He won&#39;t even fucking know about them. Because 90 percent of professors read. That&#39;s it. They read government printed books written by government funded scientists. Parrot what was parroted to them. And if they DON&#39;T parrot what they&#39;re told to parrot, they&#39;re no longer employed, and or government funded to these universities STOP. <br>FERROCELL. Look it up. It&#39;s the FUTURE of magnet study, and should be in EVERY science class.<br>Just for funzies, here&#39;s a Nikola Tesla plasma ball being spun at 4000 RPMS. When subjected to high spin velocity, the tendrils are no longer free floating within. They take order. Notice anything familiar? Take note how hard the south pole tries to form, despite the post powering it being in the way. They put a tinfoil hat on it. Notice how it tries to draw energy from it at the pole??? Northern lights.<br><a href=\"https://youtu.be/Wis_HEa3X84\">https://youtu.be/Wis_HEa3X84</a><br>BTW, your bar magnet at the beginning, is missing the centripetal convergences, aka, vortices at the &quot;Poles&quot;.", "comment_date": "2019-12-09T03:33:22Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Eli Robinson", "comment_text": "So obvious yet so helpful.

Notice that there can be NO direct/FULL/real/true/actual experience of outer space AS IT IS (at all). Outer space entirely and immediately destroys and precludes us and what would otherwise be/constitute our experience of it. SO, importantly and comparatively, FULL INERTIA (outer space) involves NO EXPERIENCE. Outer space has been referred to as &quot;our cosmic habitat&quot;. Wake up. How does a person&#39;s habitat totally kill and preclude its inhabitants? Outer &quot;space&quot; is the total opposite of our habitat. Think.<br><br>The same thing applies to &quot;Mars&quot;. Can you ever experience Mars AS IT IS? NO, YOU CAN&#39;T. If you were to attempt to experience Mars (seen, felt, AND touched), you and all of your experience would be precluded AND permanently eliminated/destroyed. So, if you pump in air on a section of what you think is then really &quot;Mars&quot;, you are not experiencing Mars; as it is impossible for you to truly, actually, and really experience Mars (at all, AS IT IS). So, you then have a totally unnatural, fabricated, and totally bizarre experience THAT YOU HAVE TOTALLY CREATED/MANUFACTURED.

I think a proton is a magnetic monopole and an electron is a magnetic monopole too, one positive the other negative. Are not protons repulsing other protons and atracting electrons? Now, why the electrons don&#39;t collide with the protons? I think it is the same explanation as why planets don&#39;t collide against suns: because in the center of suns and planets there is not just one magnet but two magnets, one inside the other and with poles reversed. That way the orbits of planets is just the place where atraction of the external magnets and then repulsion of the internal magnets, happens. I think same is on protons and electrons, both have a double system that avoids them colliding.

Again, brilliant work and well done. <br>I am an 80 year old engineer and I was born in Malta where swimming and diving and boating and sailing and watching the waves hitting my boats and  breakwater at any angle  and watching the  bow waves and the rear waves of displacement hulls and the water around rotating propellers and rudders, this visible behaviour was very familiar to me. At the Royal Naval Dockyards I worked  at, I dealt with  any electrical machine, and klystrons and magnetrons and wave-guides and antennas and so the invisible  looped curling and diverging  functions in Radio work came into my mind, these were just beautiful and so elegant to deal with, as if they actually spoke to me.  I dealt with propellers and turbines and it was such a lonely feeling to have understood how the gap between the blades of a jet multiblade disc used in a compressor or the turbine  stage , where for a compressor they have a narrower entry than their exist while in a turbine they have a wider entry and a  narrower exit. Many students  found it difficult to understand &quot; the square root of negative numbers&quot;. Again, being used to playing in any of the combinations of the functions  in three space dimension and time, I quickly grasped the  operational meaning of &quot; the square root of minus one&quot;  all due to the fact that to go from positive numbers to negative numbers, one needs not walk on a straight line but one could move/rotate into a  lateral surface area and cover a rotating angle, so a pole can be made to look the other direction by giving it a  two rotations of ninety degrees which is what I call a &quot;minus pole&quot;. Many books call the J operator &quot; imaginary&quot;  but I do not, and never will,  as the ninety degree operator is a &quot; real function&quot; .  I used to speak of a  J(car) or a ---(car)   or a JJJ (car) or a JJJJ ( car)  where the J  is a ninety degree operator.  The world around me was always so fascinating, and such mathematical operator were even better than the symbol operators of the English language which I am now using. All my engineering and mathematical functions were REAL  and like a language symbol their  true function is never found in a sentence!<br><br>The Grad, the Divergence, the Curl operators,  were such Musical and such Artistic harmonious functions,  when I found  what they meant and to recognise  that they were always all around me, was a thrill that lived with me all my life.  The diverging ends of musical  wind instruments,  operated on  the wind just like wave guides operated on their electric magnetic loops,  loops, nothing by curled loops.  I hate it when the electromagnetic field is shown as a few short short vertical and horizontal arrows on two  FLAT sinusoidal functions.   Books and Authors who show electromagnetic waves as two flat functions are just not paying respect to  these  beautiful curling pair which  form what I call the MOLECULE THAT MAKES UP OUR UNIVERSE.  It is a small part of God.  That  curled E/M pair  is what is all contained in  Einstein&#39;s equation  E=mc^2  where both Energy  and mass  are made up of the curling  pair E/M.<br>In the particle world, the  electron , uses divergences, and curls to work all electrical appliances which are  particle bounded ,while in a non particle world,  the curls and divergences around the electron are launched into space, all because they have the  power associated with a  RATE OF CHANGE.   The  &#39;power&#39; that is contained in the operator &quot; rate of change of a function&quot;  is unseen by many . The rate of change of the rate of change of a function , has its own particular powerful phenomena and  proceeding to differentiate a function  brings about a language that should be shown in all schools as &quot; if if one considers a car..... what function could be allocate to the statement, &quot;  The rate of change of the rate of change or  the rate of change of the rate of change of the rate of change of the car!<br>Dealing with Divergences and Curls, as applied to the wedded  couple, as the LOOP that makes an Electric field  curling the LOOP that makes up the magnetic field ,  these seems to be able to breed themselves as when a man &quot;converges&quot; on a woman  to curl with her to produce children who when they grow up they could curl with other counterpart conjugating partners and the   community grows to form its complex  social behaviour, all through humans diverging and curling  with the right partner.   In a power station the innocence of a magnetic loop in an iron loop,  curling with an electrical loop in a copper loop,  is  always fed to the similar equivalent curling E/M loops found in Transformers, where the Primary copper coil and the Secondary Copper Coil are the Electric loops and the Closed Iron path are the Magnetic loop. Leaving  for now, the Divergences that  are formed in the E/M fields of transformers, one can prove that the E/M loops breed themselves in cascaded  transformers if we consider all the substations in any nation including all those linked together and many transformers are connected in cascade or in parallel.   Here the consumer and homes and hotels, very far away, will get their curled Magnetic and  Electric loops in the form of current and voltages, but I shall add a little humour here ,so considering one transformer we can make the following statements.<br>The  the magnetic  field is the CURL of the secondary voltage<br>The primary voltage is the CURL of the magnetic field of the transformer.<br>The primary coil is the CURL  of the  CURL  of the secondary. winding coil!!  Electrically and Magnetically those curls had to navigated through!     <br>So we can say that  what a consumer gets at his home, after it goes through the substations and transmission line is:<br>( what  electric voltage the consumer gets at his home  is  in fact , the curl of the curl, of the curl, of the curl, of the curl, of the curl, of the curl, of the curl<br>  , of the curl, of the curl, of the curl, of the curl, of the curl of the  permanent magnetic loop at the rotor of the alternator at the power station,which in addition to Curling in space, it is changing in time)<br>I would say that Maxwell would be very pleased that we used his third and fourth equation  (CurlE=--dB/dt   and    Curl H=J+dE/dt )  in this expanded form!!!!<br>May I conclude by saying that you are all receiving this information, what I am  typing, through the fact  that the mass and charge of an electron is  made to vibrate in the particle world to create the E/M loop and these then leave the particle world, to enter a non particle space and they breed a few million curl of the curl of the curl and this is the manner the information is reaching your home, through real and displaced or apparent charges/currents,  having gradients, and we can diverge them and curl them in transmission lines and antennas and wave-guides and horns . I shall not repeat it all , but the whole universe  is all gradients of time and space functions and they diverge and curl with each other in space while changing in time .   <br>This video describes the whole universe and I would even say  the video showed us a little of God&#39;s  own behaviour. I wish that many schools, all schools in fact should give a little of  my childhood in Malta  to all their students, playing with the water and the wind  and the sun around me.  All my food I give my family has arrived from the sun&#39;s energy to grow plants  an animals that I eat  eat to sustain us. It all came to us through Divergences and a multitudes of the curl of the curl of the curl of a wedded pair E/M loops curling and coupling and copulating and conjugating with each other............ note the C in the curl,  how it gives so much  colour to a curling human functions.   All our food is a few curls of the sun. If an artist had to read this, he should say, &quot; All art needs to bow its head to all this beauty&quot;<br>Apologies for any language error, I am tired and I am going to sleep.", "comment_date": "2018-08-28T18:26:34Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Gustavo K", "comment_text": "Is the  next video available already ? , or I\u2019m too impatient ? , can\u2019t find it ..", "comment_date": "2018-08-28T16:02:44Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "TREEofLIFE", "comment_text": "\ud83d\udc4d\ud83d\ude07\ud83c\udf33", "comment_date": "2018-08-28T04:31:28Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Jim Batey", "comment_text": "Fantastic video.

I guess this can probably be tied back to my brother&#39;s work as it does involve dynamic systems, but I don&#39;t see how it any connections to the ideas that are useful in graphics like the gradient. The flow analogies are confusing because I&#39;d think of flow as being a sort of derivative in itself rather than the default interpretation of a vector field. I&#39;ve been thinking about it a bit, and I realized that operations were probably only for these sorts of vector fields, not the more general idea, because the formulas involve a direction relationship between the input and output vector spaces (eg. in physics they both refer to physical space, this contrasts with graphics, where the input space is spatial, but the output space is a color), and derivative interpretations of vector spaces strictly enforce a relation between the input and output space, namely the output space being some form of derivative of the input space. I guess I see how this is going to start tying in with complex analysis, as the complex numbers are a special vector space, and the complex derivative relates to functions that map from that space back to itself.

While I was attending class, Grant&#39;s videos on calc 1 (specially integrals but also derivatives) had helped me get a very good intuition as to what was actually going on with multi variable calculus even though the calculus series of 3b1b focused more on calc 1, so I did very well on the tests. But some topics in the final are topics that had not been tested during the course, and that combined with other reasons I ended up never taking the final. Those topics were the integration theorems that involve divergence and curl and also ordinary differential equations. I did learn how to solve the problems, but it always left a bad taste since I just accepted they were true without some level of understanding of the math behind it. And my professors also dismiss the nabla operator as a notation trick, but after 3b1b&#39;s calc 1 series I could not quite accept it. But now it&#39;s all good.

I came up with this: let function f(z) be a complex function where z = a + bi. To take the derivative of this in the &quot;x&quot; dimension (using the plotting system), we would take df(z)/da. Using the chain rule this works out to be df(z)/dz * dz/da. Since z = a+bi, this is equal to df(z)/dz * d(a+bi)/da. Since d(a+bi)/da = 1, this means that df(z)/da = df(z)/dz, which I think is quite an insight. You can do a similar thing with respect to b except an i ends up in there. Someone please correct me if I am wrong.<br><br>Edit: I think I figured it out. If you have a vector field where the x component is the derivative with respect to a of a complex function, and the y component is the derivative with respect to b, this means the curl and divergence will always be 0. Using my above formulas, if we call the function f(z), we get our vector field as &lt;df(z)/da, df(z)/db&gt; = &lt;df(z)/dz, -i*df(z)/dz&gt;. Taking the divergence of this we get d^2(f)/dz^2 + (-i)^2*d^2(f)/dz^2 = 0. Curl is much easier to show and does not require the above insight.

It was very difficult and i almost gave up many times thinking im too stupid for profound level of mathematics. But I couldnt live with myself thinking im a failure or im not smart enough for high level math. needless to say i graduate not with a GPA of 4.0 or anything. far from it in fact. But i did get it done and for the rest of my life i can be a little proud of myself.<br>I said that to get to my next point and prove the fact that even though math almost broke me down, it became my absolute true love and passion. My experience with mathematics and my journey through my years of being a student of ASU, left me wishing for one thing and one thing only. I wish I was smarter. dont get me wrong. in December of 2016 among a few thousand students that graduated with various degrees, there where only 17 single souls that actually graduated with a pure math degree. I was only of the 17. I can completely take pride in that. but instead of being content and satisfied and happy with that (which i sort of am happy) it made me realize something. maybe even something scary and sad for me personally. That moment of epiphany was when i realized how complected and difficult math could get and some people better than me have the mental capacity to understand it, but not me. it made me very sad and i envy and applaude those who understand more mathematics than me. You are the true geniuses. The fact that i might never have the potential to be a mathematics PhD or as smart as one, haunts me everyday. I wish i had a friend or sibling or enough money to hire a full time tutor to just work with me and teach me more math. now that im out of school and into work field (im currently a cyber security analyst) i feel like im not learning more math. not only that, i am slowly loosing grip on some concepts. Some say music and dance and art and literature are magical and require special talent. with all due respect, i think there is nothing more astonishing than mathematics. It is the actual and factual magic that others refer to as not being real. The mathematical concept and the web that it creates from simple concept of numbers to multi dimensional field analysis is simply above and beyond this world. <br>here is an interesting concept to maybe give 5 minutes of thinking. imagine you are a math student and you learned a relatively easy but still profound mathematical concept. say you can solve a differential equation of some order but nothing too crazy or exception cases. maybe better yet, you can solve some partial diff eq problems using laplace or heat or wave equations or do a simple linear trasformation of vector spaces. say you are at that level. imagine you were asked to talk about that to a friend or family member or even a stranger that is your normal average person. notice how difficult it is to convey the information to him or her. notice how strange that conversation would be. then think about what it takes for that person to learn prior to your conversation so he or she can relate. it is like meeting someone at 60th or 70th floor of a building that might be 100+ story tall. imagine if you wanna live in the 70th floor of a building. in order to do that you have to build 69 floors before you can even initiate the 70th floor. you might run out of time, you might run out of budget, you might run out of patience or interest before you get to live where you want. with mathematics (followed closely by phsyics and then chemistry and other sciences) you have to start from the bottom and have to build everything sturdy and correctly and it take hard work, dedication, sacrifice, and genetic smartness. <br>take pride, be mindful of others success, and always help the ones in need. There is nothing more valuable than bringing that enlightenment to others who share the same passion not even life itself. you wont be able to guess what i would give up just to gain more mathematical knowledge but alas, i am not that smart.", "comment_date": "2018-06-22T06:40:11Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Soumyadip Sarkar", "comment_text": "I was just waiting for  lecture series on this topic,,thank u,,<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%233blue\">#3blue</a> 1 brown,,now it&#39;s gonna be a ingenious lesson for all of us in vector calculas,,,let&#39;s start the journey", "comment_date": "2018-06-22T06:39:32Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Andy", "comment_text": "Probably one of the best videos ever created in mathematics education.", "comment_date": "2018-06-22T06:28:23Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Snejpu", "comment_text": "Special for 1 M subscribers?", "comment_date": "2018-06-22T06:27:44Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Pikachulova7", "comment_text": "love the way you explain and emphasize the intuitions, I think it really attracts people to math. lovr the channel as always", "comment_date": "2018-06-22T06:26:19Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Akarsh Kumar", "comment_text": "There\u2019s a donor named \u201cAkash Kumar\u201d \ud83d\ude02", "comment_date": "2018-06-22T06:24:03Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Vladimir Shitov", "comment_text": "I love your videos, they make math so alive!

As mentioned in the video, we analyze the Jacobian, specifically the eigenvalues -- this comes from the Hartman-Grobman theorem. Since the divergence of a function is the trace of the Jacobian, and the trace of a matrix is the sum of the eigenvales, the sign of the divergence will be negative at point attractors and positive at point repellors. However, it obscures some of the information; you may have one smaller positive and one larger negative eigenvalue, which will give a negative divergence, but the point will be a saddle point and not an attractor. The curl is even less helpful, as it only really exists in on orientable 3-dimensional Reimannian manifolds, which limits its use to mostly just physical systems.
