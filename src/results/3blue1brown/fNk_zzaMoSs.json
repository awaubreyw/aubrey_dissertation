The name \u201cIslam\u201d is chosen by God (Allah) and not by man. It is the same unifying Message revealed to all the Prophets and Messengers by Allah and which they spread amongst their respective nations. In its Final form it was revealed to Muhammad (Peace &amp; Mercy of Allah be upon him) as a complete Message to whole mankind. The Lord, Allah, is the True and Only Creator that deserves to be worshipped. No worship is worthy of being given to a stone, statue, a cross, a triangle, Khomeini, Farakhan, Eliajahs, Malcom\u2019s X or Y, Ghandi, Krishna, Guru, Buddha, Mahatma, Emperor, Joseph Smith, Sun, Moon (not to that from Korea too!), Light, Fire, rivers, cows, Rama, Temples, Prophets, Messengers (Yes! Muslims do not worship Muhammad-peace be upon him), Saints, Priests, Monks, Movie Stars, Sheiks, etc.!!! All are created beings or things.<br><br>ALLAH, is the Name of the One True God. His Name is not chosen by man and does not have a number or gender. It is known that Allah is the Name of God in Aramaic, the language of our beloved Prophet Jesus and a sister language of Arabic. The Name \u201cAllah\u201d has been used by all previous Prophets starting with Adam and by the last and final Prophet, Muhammad (Peace be upon them all).<br><br><br>The Innate Nature in man recognizes what is good and bad, what is true and false. It recognizes that the Attributes of Allah must be True, Unique, and All-Perfect. It does not feel comfortable towards any kind of degradation of His Attributes not does it qualities to the Creator. Many who became \u201cdiscontent with God\u201d did so because of the practices of the Church in medieval Europe and because of the claims of \u201cgod dwelling in a son\u201d and the concept of the \u201coriginal sin\u201d. However, they \u201cescaped\u201d into worshipping a new theory called \u201cmother nature\u201d as well as the \u201cmaterial\u201d World. With the advancement of materialistic technology others from different religions adopted the concept of \u201cforgetting about God\u201d and \u201clet us live this life and enjoy it!\u201d, not realizing that they have chosen the worship of the \u201coriginal god\u201d of Rome: Desire!.<br><br>NOW we can see that all of this materialistic and secular progress produced a spiritual vacuum that led to complex social, economical, political, and psychological problems. Many of those who \u201cfled\u201d their \u201creligions\u201d are in search again. Some try to \u201cescape\u201d the complexity of their daily lives via various means. Those who had the chance to examine the Qur\u2019an and Islam, proceed with a complete way of life that relates man to establish a purpose for his presence on earth. This is well recognized in the Attributes of Allah and what does He require from man. He does not want man to be enslaved to any false deity: nature, drugs, lust, money, other man, desire, or sex. He provides man with the proofs that He is the One who can redeem so that man can free himself from the slavery to any form of creation and to turn to his Creator Alone. THIS Creator Has Perfect Attributes. He is the First, nothing is before Him, the Ever Living. To Him is the Final Return where everyone will be dealt with in the Most Perfect and Just way. He does not begot nor He is begotten. Those who attribute Divinity to Jesus forget or ignore the fact that Jesus was in a mother\u2019s womb. He needed nutrition; he was born and grew up to be a man. He was trusted with the Gospel as a Message to the Children of Israel: \u201cFor there is One God, and one mediator (i.e. a messenger) between God and men (the Children of Israel), the man Christ Jesus) (I Timothy 2:5). A man-messenger calling his nation not to worship him: \u201cBut in vain they do worship me!\u201d (Mathew 15:9). A man who needs to eat, walk, sleed, rest, etc.. cannot have Divine Attributes because he is in need and God (Allah) is Self-Sufficient.<br><br><br>AS far as Buddhism, Hinduism, Zoroastrianism, Marxism, and Capitalism,<br>there is the devotion of worshipping created being/things in one form or another. Jews had attributed a \u201cNationalistic\u201d belonging to Allah. They labeled Him \u201cThe Tribal God\u201d for the Children of Israel. Men and women following these \u201creligions\u201d were born with the natural inclination of submission to their Creator, Allah. It is their parents who had driven them into their respective traditions. However, once people are exposed to the Signs of Allah around them, or in the Qur\u2019an or to someone who triggers thei Fitra (natural inclination to worship Allah Alone), the reverting process begins and that is why we see a universal spreading of Islam. In the West and despite tha many distortions of Islam in the Media, many admit that Islam may be the fastest growing Faith. No sense of fairness can be achieved without a genuine attempt to know the Word of Allah in the Qur\u2019an and not on the 30-min-Evening News. This is the real challenge for those who seek the Truth. Man is created for a purpose: to live a life in accordance with Allah\u2019s way. Why Not? Do we posses the air we breath? Did we create ourselves or others? Or were we ourselves the Creators? We are limited and weak. So is our right to ignore our Creator where we all need Him?<br><br><br>ISLAM is the submission in worship to Allah Alone and it is the essence of all the Messages sent to all nations before us. Allah is All-Just and All-Wise. He does not intend confusion for His Creation. The religion accepted to Him is the one chosen by Him. Its essence must be One, because He is One. It is free from geographical, racist, and status oriented concepts. It is Perfect and it is the complete way of life. All these qualities are chosen by Allah in His Only Religion: Islam. Its details are in in the Qur\u2019an, read it and come with an open heart because none can expose better than the World of Allah. The Qur\u2019an was revealed to Prophet Muhammad. He did not author it. He was unlettered. Its translation is available in many languages in bookstores or in an Islamic Center close to you. Take the time to read it and come/call the Islamic Center, or speak to someone who re-verted and submitted to Allah Alone.<br>Prepared by Dr. Saleh As-Saleh", "comment_date": "2022-03-21T07:13:49Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Hoony K.", "comment_text": "I&#39;m so glad as a student halfway through the semester, this video was underwhelming lol, as it should be, but the visuals was real nice to watch.", "comment_date": "2022-03-21T01:23:53Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Kevin -", "comment_text": "<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fNk_zzaMoSs&amp;t=5m35s\">5:35</a><br><b>PINK PI</b><br><br><br><b>BOTTOM TEXT</b>", "comment_date": "2022-03-19T03:05:36Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Zaiden 777", "comment_text": "Why yes YouTube, I&#39;d love to learn about vectors right now!", "comment_date": "2022-03-17T02:44:58Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Varun Nair", "comment_text": "holy shit this makes so much sense now", "comment_date": "2022-03-15T17:40:14Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Aditya Chakma", "comment_text": "25 years and, only now I understood why are they called scalers.", "comment_date": "2022-03-13T16:47:38Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "King Wesley", "comment_text": "The Mathematician, The Physicist, and the Engineer is a triad as old as human history.

A stupid scholar all overturned this truth and built it to a convenient system of Mason. Thus, the people believe the trickery of the devil than words of God. Darwin&#39;s evolutionary theory, the Copernican theory of Galileo, the theory of relativity, quantum mechanics, mathematics, the medicine of Einstein are all errors. A ghost, a UFO, supernatural power, the miracle of God to be said to be the occult are rather true. A thing and a ghost (God) exist in the world, and space is active by spiritual power (conception) of God. As for God, all things were created by the soul of language. It is clear if I read the Bible. Because the present scholar mixes the logic thoroughly in human wisdom, it cannot arrive at the truth. It is intuitive power to be important. Why does a child seem to be? The thing which cannot answer this is a mistake. Our common sense is more right than a stupid scholar. The creation of God comes loose only by a fate. Everything becomes the material by a conception of God (person).<br> <br>I cannot prove 1+1 = 2 in a numerical formula. I can prove only a physical phenomenon to say that it is in two apples when I match another one apple with one apple. It is not 0+1 \u2260 1. As 0 (nothing) is not quality, you must not handle it for a number. Because quality is different even if I match a mandarin orange with an apple, there is not a meaning of the addition. Because it does not exist other than God when I define God as existence, no (0) does not exist. Because the mathematics defines 0, negative number, imaginary number, \u221e which do not exist in the world, it is an error and is a fiction. A number is to count quality. When I am separated from a physical phenomenon, the mathematics does not have the significance of being.<br><br>\u203bIf 0 exists by a definition of the mathematics, 0 of the infinity must exist. However, the infinite space, infinity do not exist. In other words, because the mathematics defines 0, negative number, imaginary number, \u221e which do not exist, it is an error and is a fiction. Therefore it is an error because a zeta function, the numerical formula of the second oiler product deal with this infinity. That it becomes sum of series \u03a3 = 1+2+3+ ... = - 1/12 of the natural number, or the product of all prime numbers is 4\u03c0^2. It turns out that it is an error if I think for common sense. It is limited, and the mathematician seems to get a wrong this, but uses the sophism when I calculate this endlessly if right. This is a mistake of the definition of 0 or \u221e and is the evidence that mathematics gets a wrong. It is definition f&#39;(x) = limh of the differential calculus that must not divide it by 0 \u2192 0 {the same as it being 0 that says that I bring h close to 0 without a limit, and dividing it by a numerical formula of f(x+h)-f(x)}/h. I divide it by 0. The mathematics is trickery not study in this way.<br><br> All the origins of the scientific theory are random, and a bottom is broken. For example, in the theory of elementary particles, an electron joins atoms together and becomes the molecules. A thing joining a proton and a neutron together is a mesotron, and three quarks connect the proton, and there is it. An electron and a positron (antimatter) occur from a photon. An elementary particle to tie the elementary particle to whenever a new elementary particle is discovered is necessary and loses the relations with an elementary particle and the elementary particle more and more. Though a proton and the neutron are the same mass, why does a difference occur in having electric charge or not? The science has no answer with it in these questions. An electron is a material so that I think, and the positron is not a material in the hole of the material loss that the circumference was surrounded by in the soul children. In other words, the antimatter is an illusion. The scholar is going to examine it logically and loses sight of the truth. The structure of built nature of God is simpler, but is the thing which it is hard to understand in the human wisdom. A photon seems to have a particle and the two characteristics of the wave, but, in fact, the light has the property of the wave with the soul body.<br><br> Message from the spiritual world of Einstein <br> When oneself saw a scene of heaven through a tunnel of the light in the meantime, the person who experienced suspended animation well is you after the revival. The moving speed of the soul does not receive gravitational restraint anymore, and, as for the law of the speed of light immutability that I discovered during the lifetime, there are none in the world of the consciousness. In other words, I will say that it just moves to say that I think. Furthermore, it is just handed down to a partner to have thought. The life of all of us shares what one interiority. And the material is to say that it was actually consciousness. There are all things in your heart, and, also, you are existence to live in a heart of all life. When all of this space watches it with eyes, it is seen like the outside world, but is to say that the world to be actually seen outside is your interiority. The relativity disappears in here, and this space consists based on &quot;universal truth to certainly say to call God&quot;. <br><br> Near future to read from revelation and illuminati card of God of days, and to untie it in Japan<br> April, 2020 xx day The United States bombs North Korea. North Korea adds nuclear attack to a big city of Japan and a U.S. base as the retaliation. Japan swats it to a bog of the war, and they are dropped by a plot of the United States. There are China, Russia after North Korea and becomes the fight with Japan, American allied powers and drags the world into World War 3.<br> x moon xx Japan and the United States country attacks it in Japan with the Allied Forces in 2021<br> World War 3 begins in 2021 on xx moon xx day<br> Mount Fuji erupts very much on xx day in October, 2023. Major earthquakes occur in a row in all parts of the world. <br> An asteroid collides on the earth on xx moon xx day in 2023, and the earth becomes muddy sea <br> The world (heaven) of the Maitreya is built on xx moon xx day in 2024<br><br> Final note<br> The human being denies violence and war, but is it not violence and killing each other I kill a cow pig, and to eat meat? I conquer the world in the life of the hell of the cruel survival of the fittest and am useless even if only oneself is going to be saved. Because a killed animal retaliates for a human being, cancer occurs. The meat which I ate becomes the blood, and a vindictive spirit dwells in a cell when blood does formation to a cell. A human being is cruel, and a fornication, a falsehood, committing theft, the habit of the evil deed of the luxury are not stopped. Eating meat is indirect killing. Why is God that existence of the evil is permitted? It lets you compensate for a human crime by the devil. A disaster, an epidemic, the war damage are the wrath of Heaven. Because a Japanese savior buys the crime of the world people, it is sacrificed. I fall in the trees and plants in spite of the pains then even if I writhe with a hell if it is just and changes the heart and does not straighten an act to measure up to hearts of God. Mason finally leads the world to the World War 3. it is started with nuclear attack to Japan as a pilot light.

Stepping first in the direction of the x-axis vector and then in the direction specified by the y axis vector DOES achieve the same ENDPOINT as if we had traveled along the hypotenuse. And if we are teleporting from point to point, or generating computer graphics that only care about how we visualize the endpoint...sure. There is no reason not to treat the matrix of vectors as equivalent to the endpoint. But to me, the animation is head-splitting, because you&#39;re asking me to visualize two identical triangles for two identical formulas, it feels...like a space paradox. It also feels like something worth noting as potential confusion for those of us with less common sense or logical intuition or whatever. Like, the distance of that path cannot be equal to the distance of the hypotenuse, only the squares of that distance can be equal to the square of that hypotenuse. Or something. I should go review that before I post this. But it doesn&#39;t matter, because we aren&#39;t talking about distance in space, we are talking about vectors, the point of calling them something different from lines, the reason we have special words for this, is self-evident. We need to distinguish outlines from lines that just describe invisible motion, lines that describe motion through time...is that what a vector is? Motion through time? and that&#39;s just hard to keep in the back of my head when I look at this. I don&#39;t need to care about the distances because the goal of this math is to represent the scaling of points, not worry about the lengths of imaginary lines.", "comment_date": "2021-07-22T08:50:32Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "dk kanofkash", "comment_text": "<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fNk_zzaMoSs&amp;t=9m20s\">9:20</a> Is that language C?", "comment_date": "2021-07-21T03:47:57Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Alvint", "comment_text": "ffff**k !! where have you been all along huh !?", "comment_date": "2021-07-20T16:50:38Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Tomasz Ga\u0142kowski", "comment_text": "Game programmers being like a weird mix of physics students and CS students...", "comment_date": "2021-07-20T12:24:08Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "EvilSandwich", "comment_text": "Wait wait wait.

It depressed me so much that i couldnt even practice at home, because our script was just so cryptic, not-visual and student-unfriendly that i basically just gave up. All this while having a lot of problems in my private life.<br>Then, after 2 semesters and 2 completely failed LA exams, i discoverd this account and playlist.<br><br>@3Blue1Brown i am infinitely thankful for your work, and that you just teach us all for free here. I am thankful to you, because you put in the extra work to actually understand people, us, and to understand why we do not understand, unlike the most professors at university.<br>I am thankful for your character, how you speak, how you animate the pi&#39;s and how astonishingly simple and beautiful you just animated Linear Algebra.<br><br>If it was not because of you, i would not have passed this Linear Algebra exam (which i was automatically signed up to every semester, without the option to cancel) in my fourth semester. It was my third and last try (was sick in third sem.) as i would have been expelled if i did not pass this last time.<br><br>Out of the 20 points that i needed to pass, i got 19... but i did not accept. I kept fighting. I said to myself \u201eyou have come this far, you will not stop here, you will reach the finish line\u201c. And after 1 hour of discussion, i managed to get two seperate half points.<br><br>And on that day i was the happiest person on this planet. <br><br>Thank you @3Blue1Brown for everything.<br>And to everybody struggling: You have read a small part of my story. You can make it. You can achieve anything, even in the most desperate moments. If you really want it.<br><br>Now to give back to @3Blue1Brown i will buy some of your merch with great pleasure, and look forward to the days where i will look at my @3Blue1Brown shirt or socks and think about how i somehow managed to turn the tables.

Thats what makes people say that mathematics are just simply throwing numbers around and that theyll never even need them so they can just simply forget what they knew at the end of high school. When someone explains all of this to you youre left with a deep enough knowledge to apply it without ever having to forget how it goes because you already know the fundamentals AND youre left with no questions regarding the use or applicability in life. Knowing these things and being this way typically tends to make someone love the subject because they start seeing it as easy because now they understand it at a higher level + the added challenge of the capable difficulty you can come over makes a person being attracted to the feeling of being accomplished when youre really good at something. Its just simply an ultimate letdown that ive not seen any single teacher in my 14 years of highschool experience that explained something to me on a level this deep since the whole &#39;&#39;glossing over the curricula to fit in a year&#39;&#39; thing made me hate most of the subjects that i find interesting and would gladly learn on a level where i could actually understand what they are and wanting to even know more.", "comment_date": "2019-09-14T18:51:22Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "jasia 2001", "comment_text": "great..........inner vector method", "comment_date": "2019-09-12T20:31:11Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "jc Fos", "comment_text": "It&#39;s the better video, in internet, about the vecteur, all over the world!!!

That was about it, due to having dropped out of school.  The only other thing that stood out in my mind years later was the Pythagorean theorem.  These few memories turned out to be hilarious.  Why ???  Well, in my spare time I continued to analyze &quot;Motion&quot;, because I had noticed something odd about it.  My first simple analysis of motion had led me to a motion paradox.  Eventually I did solved the paradox.  Via the use of motion vectors, simple length scalars, and the Pythagorean theorem, I then converted my new understanding of motion, into equations.  I then checked some physics books and found that my equations were identical to Einstein&#39;s Theory of Special Relativity equations, and the Lorentz Transformation equations.  However, the way in which I derived these equations, has apparently not been thought of by anyone else up to this date. The next thing that I discovered was that if I mention this achievement on YT, I get all sorts of rude responses.  I was proud of my accomplishment, especially considering the fact that I had slowly fell into a semi-coma over an 8 year period, and then spent another 8 years recovering and re-learning once the cause was discovered.  And, not to forget, I also had a head injury at age 10, which took me from being 2nd or 3rd in my class, to dropping to the bottom, and later on then actually failing grade 8.  So, overall, I am totally disgusted at the oh so many negative responses that I have received.", "comment_date": "2019-05-16T16:35:03Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "S Malik", "comment_text": "Mistake at 6: 52 , shouldn&#39;t it be X1 + X2 and Y1 + Y2 ,", "comment_date": "2019-05-15T22:21:48Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "U Schu", "comment_text": "Vielen Dank , gut erkl\u00e4rt.

Not necessary, but it helps.<br><br>Also, what software do you use for animation?", "comment_date": "2016-08-06T00:27:29Z", "likes_count": 2}, {"comment_by": "MrBartimeaus", "comment_text": "at <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fNk_zzaMoSs&amp;t=6m51s\">6:51</a> there is a mistake in your graphics, you put x1+y1 and x2+y2 instead of x1+x2 and y1+y2", "comment_date": "2016-08-06T00:26:25Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Haguatchi", "comment_text": "Great video, I love it and can&#39;t wait for the rest of the series! <br>One small oversight though, at about <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fNk_zzaMoSs&amp;t=6m50s\">6:50</a>, the vectors say that <br>[x1, y1]+[x2, y2] = [(x1+y1), (x2+y2)] <br>but shouldn&#39;t it be<br>[(x1+x2), (y1+y2)]? <br>I&#39;m on mobile so I can&#39;t see any annotations so idk if you&#39;ve already clarified that, but great video nonetheless!", "comment_date": "2016-08-06T00:26:12Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Henrique Jungles", "comment_text": "The maths-guys&#39; interpretation of vectors is far superior from the physics-guys&#39; interpretation.
