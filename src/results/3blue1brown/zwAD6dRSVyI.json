I don&#39;t know if anyone here is even interested in philosophy or spriituality, but the connection i&#39;m seeing is just too profound.<br><br>So here we go:<br>In spirituality you have those things I like to call the dimensions of conciousness. (Most people would call those the seven chakras.)<br>Your concoiousness is the inner sphere, your inner universe. The most important aspect of your psyche. (I like to see this as the spiritual realm, you could even call it the &quot;spirit world&quot;.)<br>The outer spheres are the outer world. So everything and everyone else. All the things that are influencing you from outside your own mind. (This is the &quot;material world&quot;.)<br>So as you are climbing up the dimensions of conciousness (or chakras if you want to keep it traditional) your inner world (the inner sphere) keeps growing bigger and bigger.<br>This means your spiritual capacity is growing. Spiritual capacity is equal to willpower, which is equal to your ability to &quot;manipulate&quot; the outer world. In other words your ability to create things. (Creation is the act of transforming something from one state of beeing to another, which doesn&#39;t change what it is made of (the inside) but how it looks like (the outside). On the inside/the smallest level everything consists of the same things (particles and waves).)<br>The craziest thing about all of this is that the teachings of how you should be able to percieve your reality when you reach a certain dimension (chakra) matches with the math.<br>Remember that willpower equals your spiritual capacity? The diameter of the spheres equal willpower.<br>On the lowest 3 dimensions the outer world has more power over you than you have over it. The inner sphere is smaller than the outer ones.<br>On the 4th dimensions you gain enough willpower to not be an &quot;slave&quot; of the outer world. Your inner world equals the outer world in diameter. You can start to decide your path yourself.<br>From the 5th dimension onwards your inner world starts to gain more strength than the outer world. You gain the ability to think outside of the box. You now have left the realm of conventional &quot;materialistic&quot; thinking. You will start to see the connections between EVERYTHING.<br>When you reach the 7th dimension, youre inner world has grown so big that it &quot;swallows up&quot; all of the outer world. The &quot;inner sphere&quot; now contains all of the &quot;outer spheres&quot;. Everything is now part of yourself.<br>This is the point where mind over matter starts to really kick in and the abilities of such people start to seem like magic. (Walking over burning coals without burning your feet for example.)<br><br>I hope i made my point somewhat understandable since it is pretty abstract and a bit offtopic.

There is no way to draw a line from the origin through the square without touching one of the corner circles.<br><br>When you move up to 3D space, you can already see this change. Focus on one square face of the cube. Notice the diamond shape that&#39;s not covered by any of the spheres.

Now, in the same way you can visualise the 2D problem as one of the faces of the 3D problem, think about this solution to the 3D problem as one of the faces of the 4D problem. You can actually see how there&#39;s quite a lot of space there that&#39;s not covered by the corner spheres!<br><br>The visualisation breaks down after this point, but thinking inductively how each solution is a &quot;face&quot; of the problem one dimension higher, and how the space left over creates extra space for the next dimension to use was helpful for me.", "comment_date": "2020-09-23T03:09:58Z", "likes_count": 3}, {"comment_by": "Pierre Fraisse", "comment_text": "Painting the sky in tree blue ..................", "comment_date": "2020-09-19T09:41:22Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Dhanesh Abhipraya", "comment_text": "1D X<br>2D XY<br>3D XYZ<br>4D XYZW", "comment_date": "2020-09-18T15:06:22Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Skyline", "comment_text": "Great video!", "comment_date": "2020-09-15T17:45:40Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "hillary clinton", "comment_text": "Simply take the sphere and roll into a donut in one axis..", "comment_date": "2020-09-15T14:21:39Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Cosmia's Stash", "comment_text": "Also, if you are interested, think about what happens if you have infinitely many dimensions.

The spheres aren\u2019t directly blocking the path to the nearest part of the cube, they are just forming a square around it, and leaving a gap in the middle.<br><br><br>At <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwAD6dRSVyI&amp;t=22m05s\">22:05</a>, he explains that the corners of the box in higher dimensions are actually really far from the centre. The distance to the nearest face is always 2, but the distance to the nearest sphere is the distance to point (1,1,1...) subtract 1 (the radius). (You might think of this also as the distance to the corner of the inner box - 1).<br><br>Because the distance to the corner of the inner box increases with the dimensions, this means the distance to the spheres also increases.<br><br>To take this to the extreme, in very high dimensions, you could have the spheres in the corners be really really far away, while the distance to the face of the box is still just 2.<br><br>At the moment this won\u2019t really make any sense, but we\u2019re getting there.<br><br><br>In the 2D example (<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwAD6dRSVyI&amp;t=9m45s\">9:45</a>), take one of the circles. It is touching 2 of the other 3 spheres. This leaves 1 of the other 3 that it is not touching. It is not touching (or being) 1 of the 4 spheres, or 1/4.<br><br>In 3D (<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwAD6dRSVyI&amp;t=10m35s\">10:35</a>), each sphere touches 3 others leaving 4 untouched out of the 8, or 1/2.<br><br>In 4D, each (hyper)sphere touches 4, but the are now 16 spheres, leaving 11/16 untouched!<br><br>If you increase this up to 10D, a sphere only touches 10 others, and it leaves the other 99.93% of the spheres untouched!<br><br>Because the spheres are so far away, and only linked together by a few, it is kind of like a wire-frame made of spheres!<br><br>To represent how the spheres get further away and the gap in the middle gets larger, I like to imagine instead of increasing the dimensions, that you add more sides to each face. So instead of a square of spheres with a gap in the middle as I described earlier (<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwAD6dRSVyI&amp;t=10m35s\">10:35</a>), you might have a pentagon of spheres, or a hexagon, or a decagon, so on until there is a ring of spheres in a circle. Imagine a cube where each face is instead a ring of spheres. You could also just imagine a wireframe of a cube the is made up of lots of little spheres.<br><br>They are both equally terrible analogies, but they give an intuitive sense for how it is even possible that the sphere can be bigger than the box.<br><br>Imagine this wireframe-like shape, and imagine a sphere in the middle expanding until it is touching the spheres. You can see how the sphere is poking out the edges of this wireframe?<br><br>It is very important to remember that this is absolutely not an accurate visual analogy, it is simply a tool to explain and visualise how in higher dimensions, when gap in the spheres gets bigger and bigger while the spheres get further and further away, it actually makes sense that the sphere can poke outside the box.", "comment_date": "2020-08-27T08:23:47Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Marc Lupinacci Jr", "comment_text": "So as the number of dimensions approach infinity, the radius of the inner circle in that 2 x 2 x 2 x... box is infinity, insane", "comment_date": "2020-08-25T00:57:27Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "JaynMF", "comment_text": "Beautiful", "comment_date": "2020-08-24T05:05:01Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Fuzzy Lumpkin", "comment_text": "How would it work if your box pace with the spheres dimension for dimension pls\ud83e\uddd0 anyone", "comment_date": "2020-08-13T02:54:34Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "FuriousMaximum", "comment_text": "0D Point<br>1D Line<br>2D Square<br>3D Cube<br>4D Hypercube<br>5D Megacube<br>6D Gigacube<br>7D What Am I Even Doing Now", "comment_date": "2020-08-12T18:52:19Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "mason booh", "comment_text": "Its free real estate <br><br>This guy: anger (in 3.14)", "comment_date": "2020-08-12T04:09:23Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Parker Shaw", "comment_text": "The center sphere will never touch the corner of the bounding box and the its volume will be smaller and smaller than the box.", "comment_date": "2020-08-11T04:20:45Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "N", "comment_text": "I have a simpler explanation for this:<br>When the circles are replaced by spheres, and so on, the length between the edge of the inner circle and where the outer circles meet each other stay the same, regardless of dimensions. the volume on the other hand, is increasing with each dimension.<br>Therefore, the space between the shapes grow slower than the volume of the shapes themselves as they enter higher dimensions.", "comment_date": "2020-08-11T02:29:45Z", "likes_count": 6}, {"comment_by": "K\u0131van\u00e7 Tok", "comment_text": "Topologic v0.4.0alpha<br>Topologic v0.4.1alpha<br>Topologic v0.4.2.1alpha<br>Topologic v0.4.2.2alpha", "comment_date": "2020-08-09T17:18:56Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Joshua Susanto", "comment_text": "<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwAD6dRSVyI&amp;t=22m42s\">22:42</a><br>*I may or may not have used an easy-to-compute but not-totally-accurate curve here due to the surprising difficulty in computing the real proportion :)", "comment_date": "2020-08-08T14:09:51Z", "likes_count": 17}, {"comment_by": "Pigwiggy", "comment_text": "10-dimensional cube: exists<br>Sphere: <b>i t s f r e e r e a l e s t a t e</b>", "comment_date": "2020-08-08T13:41:51Z", "likes_count": 3}, {"comment_by": "Philomathist", "comment_text": "The concept makes me think that in higher dimension the idea what is the volume is not the correct question.", "comment_date": "2020-08-02T13:28:43Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "\u03c0", "comment_text": "I can&#39;t believe I am in every single 3Blue1Brown&#39;s youtube videos", "comment_date": "2020-08-01T11:22:28Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Almir Campos", "comment_text": "OMG!

After much reflection and reviewing of this video here are a few of my key takeaways.\r<br>\r<br>For problems in 2 and 3 dimensional spaces, finding solutions is greatly helped by our ability to move back and forth between analytical and geometrical expressions of the problem. For problems in higher dimensions we do not have access to this back and forth sharing of insights. Many if not most problems are formulated in these higher dimensions.\r<br>\r<br>This video provides an example of a counterintuitive insight that did not emerge at all in 2 or 3 dimensions. Namely: in higher dimensions the radius of the inner hypersphere, tangent to all N boundary defining unit hyperspheres whose centers are one unit from the origin as measured along any one of the N orthogonal axes is greater than the distance from the origin as measured along any single orthogonal axis to the surface of the N hypercube that encompasses all N unit hyperspheres. This is indeed counterintuitive.\r<br>\r<br>After grokking how you beautifully and skillfully led all of us to this insight, I was able to distil the following. To make the counterintuitive point, there is no need to introduce the growing inner hypersphere at all.  Even in 2 and 3 dimensions the distance from the origin of any N dimension space to the center of any boundary defining unit sphere is always greater than one and grows as sqrt(N). So already for N=4, the distance from the origin to the center of any boundary unit hypersphere is greater than the distance along any one orthogonal axis from the origin to a surface of the hypercube that contains all N unit hyperspheres.\r<br>\r<br>The final grok (so far): the core insight is about the concept of distance. Not about radii, not about hyperspheres, not about boundary surfaces of all containing hypercubes. Distance from the origin to the centers of unit hyperspheres as you distribute them will always be significantly greater than the distance from the origin along an axis to any one of the containing hypersurfaces as you define them. Except in 2 or 3 dimensions.\r<br>\r<br>In yet another way:  the N dimensional distance from the origin to any  center of a unit hypersphere as you distribute them  is always greater than the distance from the origin measured on an orthogonal axis to a hypersurface defined by your distribution of the centers of the unit hyperspheres. This is true for 2, 3 and higher dimensions.

I have a question. In your sample once we go on fourth or more dimension it becomes difficult to represent the solution because we cannot apprehend more than 3 spatial dimensions. But in my mind, the solution of equation w2 + x2 + y2 + z2 = 1 represents a sphere moving on a line (w, is the position of the sphere on the line and x, y and z are the coordinates of a point of the sphere). The sphere size depend on w value (when 0\u00a0 r = 1, when -1 or 1 r = 0). Adding a 5 dimension, your sphere is now moving on a circle. The size of the circle determine de size of the sphere , (v and w are the coordinates of the sphere on the circle). At dimension 10, you have a sphere A, moving on a sphere B, moving on a sphere C which is moving on an axis D. representing all the solution of the equation should show object moving relatively to each other the size objects changing according to the value. Of course you cannot visualize all the solutions in one look, but animating object you should be able to easily show all de solutions of the equations. Am I wrong ?

You are measuring using your own finite numbers within your own finite space. You&#39;re only measuring toward your own lowest space possible, which is equally amazing to watch. If you want to measure a higher dimension, you must use 0 or \u221e, since these values are equal to your finite space. These two numbers, 0 and \u221e, mean the same thing. You use them to know which direction you are counting, not as a benchmark to reach the beyond. Whatever numbers you find after 0 or \u221e, will be meaningless and without reason, since you can&#39;t comprehend them.<br><br>Picturing or visualizing infinity / \u221e and 0 is not possible either. It is infinite space between finite spaces. It doesn&#39;t take shape or form, because that would be a defined value. So what does that mean? It means that neither can exist without the other. If you didn&#39;t have 0, you couldn&#39;t have \u221e, and vice versa. Picturing infinity as a circled shape is pointless, because that shape isn&#39;t defined, it goes on forever. You can look at a circle and say that it is indeed round, but you&#39;ll never know until you find the last digit. When you give up counting, that is when you get your circle. Defining a circle is like defining infinity. Defining a number below 1 will also equal to infinity, because 1 is the lowest number possible in finite space. Any number below 1 to 0 will be irrational, which is also true for the other direction. Anything more than 1 will eventually lead to \u221e.<br><br>If you didn&#39;t understand any of that. The numbers you find between 0 to 1, will be equally big to the numbers you find between 1 and \u221e.

Just take that new fourth dimension of location and hold it constant. That constrains the radius of the sphere in the three dimensions so you have a larger or smaller sphere to work with. This is essentially like the way the video constrained the x-dimension of the sphere before showing that it constrained the size of the circle around that point x {x = some constant | (x^2)+(y^2)+(z^2)=(r^2)} (read the &quot;|&quot; symbol as &quot;such that&quot; or &quot;given that&quot;).<br><br>The size of the sphere then correlates to the distance away from a dimension that is not able to be visually represented by drawing another line through the coordinate set because at every single point in the three dimensions (x,y,z) there will be an origin point and then a positive and negative direction extending out from that in this new fourth dimension (if this were not the case then there would be some points in the three dimensional space where the fourth dimension would never be able to equal some given real number).<br><br>This fourth dimension here operates much like gravity. Particles move through three dimensional space, but always rest atop &quot;the fabric of space.&quot; So imagine if you would that &quot;the fabric of space&quot; which is a flat surface had observable edges, and that a single particle rested in the middle of that flat sheet of space. Also imagine that this particle resting on space, were the shape of a sphere and would displace the fabric of space until the widest portion of the sphere were in line with the plane of flat space. Now let&#39;s assume that this resting point, where the area of the intersection between the spherical particle and the plane of flat space is maximized, is the origin point in the fourth dimension (call it g).<br><br>Well then as we pull up on this particle the area of the interception (area of the created circle) would have to decrease. This decrease we could then be translated back into a proportional change in the radius of the sphere(x,y,z), so that lifting the particle to the point where it is tangential to the plane of flat space would be represented by a point somewhere in the (x,y,z) dimension. This is akin to saying the size of the sphere in (x,y,z) space correlates proportionally to the observed mass of the object and that lifting the particle off the surface of space so that the two no longer interact then causes the particle to have no observable mass and therefor cannot be represented in (x,y,z) space.", "comment_date": "2019-01-16T07:23:20Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "The Crystal Memes", "comment_text": "It&#39;s nice how the video is over 20 minutes long but he doesn&#39;t put any midroll ads.<br><br><br><br><br><br>Respect man, respect.", "comment_date": "2019-01-15T16:04:05Z", "likes_count": 2234}, {"comment_by": "John Smith", "comment_text": "A hollow 4D sphere projected into 3D is just a massive 3D sphere.", "comment_date": "2019-01-14T20:51:44Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Lucas Johnson", "comment_text": "Sounds like  what u see on a dmt trip hyper dimensonal self transforming jeweled balls of infinity.", "comment_date": "2019-01-14T16:28:10Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Homete", "comment_text": "Found an algorithm to work the radius of the inner sphere by using a point on the corner sphere where the real estate is distributed equally on all axises.", "comment_date": "2019-01-14T15:14:24Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Alfred Inselberg", "comment_text": "This is really beautiful.

The higher you go in dimensions the more complexity you add, but essentially it will always equate to an n dimensional object being constructed of n -1 dimensions. I think I have the answer to a question I have always wondered about. How do you get something infinite from something finite. Answer = you change dimension. As such a 4D object will be finite in 4D space, but the 3D objects it is constructed from will be infinite. By this I mean a 4D sphere is constructed from an infinite number of 3D spheres. So the implication (if I have this right) is that if the universe is (for arguments sake, it is most probably larger) a 4D object, then that is why its 3D component is infinite. Hell, that means there are an infinite number of 3D universes that add up to one 4D universe. Maybe the fact that our universe can be infinitely large and infinitely small is evidence that higher dimensions exists.

But the sun does not move faster. It travels at the same speed during the sunrise, sunset and noon periods. Something else to consider is that the earth is rotating at ~360 degrees a day. That means for the most part, noon is noon all year\u00a0round at a given point at 12 o&#39;clock. But as\u00a0the sub travels around the sun, the noon is still noon even through the earth is on the opposite\u00a0side of the sun which is impossible!! sure there is a leap day every 4 years but that only accounts for the change in the season meaning if those were not done, a day in the spring after 720 years would be a day in the fall (180 days times 4 years) and does NOT change the fact that noon is noon is noon each day.", "comment_date": "2018-04-01T06:50:04Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Wynaut Videos", "comment_text": "Lol so many math channels take away the coma, which is usually in the middle:<br>3blue, 1brown<br>Blackpen, redpen<br>There were a few other, but I forgot", "comment_date": "2018-04-01T03:03:15Z", "likes_count": 2}, {"comment_by": "Titan Thanos", "comment_text": "It needs 100x more views and subscribers", "comment_date": "2018-03-27T09:20:37Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "NoMoreSteaks", "comment_text": "I&#39;ve heard about this 80/20 phenomenon!

I think a better question would be: at what point does the inner circle fully contain the box, or even the outer box? If this point is ever achieved, then the contradiction would become much more clear. For example, the outer circles are required to fit in these boxes somewhere. If the inner circle contains the box, then the outer circles must be contained partially or even fully in the inner circle.

What if the 4th dimension is right here, where we are. The earth is round. Its like a ball. Like the model of the 3th dimension. Keep that in mind! So lets say i live in the 2nd dimension, the earth cant be round. Thats impossible, i cant even imagine that. The earth has to be flat! Doesnt that sound familiar? I have one big question that led me to that theory: Why did people believe so sincerly the earth is flat? I think its because we took it over from the 2nd dimension. Our thoughts, over generations. And at some point we realized it. The earth isnt flat. Its round. Maybe at some point we realize that the earth isnt round but something else. Thats where i get to my point that the 4th dimension is right here, we just cant see it. We live on the same planet with infinit amounts of dimensions. Infinit amount of people. All here, everyone in his own dimension. Im not totally sure about this, because if thats true, then who are the people in the second dimension? Is the 2nd dimension our TV-Shows? Maybe its the cartoons? If thats so then we are cartoons of the living beings in the 4th dimension. Im not so sure but i think its something you can think about. Infinit times, because there are infinit possibilities. <br><br>Right to that i have another point i want to talk about. I know it sounds kind of creepy and crazy, but what if we get to the next by simply dying? That could be another point why we think the earth is round, because we died but had still some minor memories of what the world is and took that over in our new lives. But we found out later that its not the truth. The theory is that time is the 4th dimension specialpoint. So what happens when we die? Thats just my opinion: its like we are sleeping. There is one thing that everyone knows about dreaming. Time goes by at his own pace. It feels like 1 minute or 1 day, completly different. We bring whole stories from 6 hours of sleep every night. Most of them we just forget. But when we die, we might actually be able to enter the 4th dimension. Just like in our dreams but have perfect controll over it. At this point i fail to understand how you can enter the 5th dimension since time is irrelevant, how can you die? I think the whole world as we know is not anything we can consider happening there. It will be something completly new. Its like imagining a new color. Simply impossible, but thats how it is.<br><br>Im kind of excited to see what happens when i die, but still scared.", "comment_date": "2018-02-09T21:20:05Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Mihai Lazar", "comment_text": "It&#39;s so sad that you can&#39;t actually visualise higher dimensions", "comment_date": "2018-02-08T14:44:05Z", "likes_count": 2}, {"comment_by": "Science Hacker", "comment_text": "How can a computer software depict 4 D not possible", "comment_date": "2018-02-06T15:49:03Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Skukkix23", "comment_text": "Its fascinating but I am actually too dumb to understand it halfway. nice video though", "comment_date": "2018-02-06T10:01:38Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Planet McHanic", "comment_text": "Beautiful lesson on the nature of space.

At least, in a non-spatial sense.<br><br>Why is this? Well, consider what a computer display actually is showing you;<br><br>It&#39;s a flat plane broken up into small lights. These are called pixels.<br>Let&#39;s first assume it&#39;s a black and white display.<br><br>If you consider drawing a point with this display, how much data do you need?<br>An X and Y coordinate, right? 2 dimensions.<br><br>But... Actually, no. You are implicitly assuming something here - that the point you are drawing is distinct from everything else on the display somehow.<br>Thus, you are presuming a state value for the display element<br>On a Pure black and white display, the state of a pixel can be black (off) or white (on)<br>But this is still an extra piece of data.<br>So our full specification for a point on such a display is 3 numbers:<br>X coordinate, Y coordinate, and state (on/off)<br><br>Let&#39;s upgrade to monochrome. This changes things from a binary on/off state, to a range of values. Typically on most displays since the 90&#39;s this has been 8 bits, so 256 values, though it can be less (or more).<br>Now, this starts to look very much like a third axis doesn&#39;t it?<br>Yes, all the possible &#39;positions&#39; are discrete integer values, but that&#39;s true of the X and Y coordinate as well, given they represent a 2d grid of discrete elements. You cannot light up a pixel at coordinate 2.5 by 4.8 on the display. You can only approximate this. (by rounding to the nearest integer, or antialiasing the point, which effectively uses our brightness dimension to mask limitations in our spatial dimensions.)<br><br>OK, so maybe you&#39;re starting to see something here;<br>Let&#39;s say we have a monochrome 320x240 display with 8 bit depth.<br>To specify the state of a single pixel fully, requires an X coordinate, a Y coordinate, and a brightness value.<br>So in fact in a mathematical sense our display is the integer coordinates in 3d space in a rectangular prism volume of size 320 units, by 240 units, by 256 units.<br><br>Do you see where this leads?<br>That&#39;s right.<br>Colour displays generally have 3 &#39;brightness&#39; values (one each for Red, Green, And Blue), and thus a point is specified in 5 dimensions on such a display.<br>Now, granted, 3 of those dimensions are representing something you don&#39;t typically think of as a &#39;dimension&#39;, but mathematically it&#39;s clearly analogous. <br>This leads to the obvious conclusion that if you sacrifice all colour data (and thus lighting and so on), you have a 5 dimensional display device sitting in front of you, and could visualise 5 dimensional geometry this way.<br><br>There are some obvious limitations and restrictions here though;<br>While in your two spatial dimensions you can display every integer point within the display bounds simultaneously, our colour data is restricted to defining exactly one point in each dimension.<br><br>This means what you can show this way isn&#39;t a full 5 dimensional structure, but only the &#39;surface&#39; nearest to your &#39;viewpoint&#39;<br>However, conceptually this is true of projecting 3d objects onto a 2d image plane as well.<br>It&#39;s why you cannot see the back side of a cube when looking at it&#39;s front side.

Similarly we can imagine several circles of ascending and descending radius to form a 3D sphere, a point can either move along its circle or jump to the corresponding point on the adjacent circles. Similarly we can draw an array of 3D spheres, it is not hard to picture a point moving around on this 4D sphere and with a little effort one can try holding an array of arrays of 3D spheres in memory. This process can be iterated arbitrarily with sufficient approximation: draw a grid where each box represents 3D space, put a sphere in the middle tile then iteratively put smaller spheres in each adjacent tile; Contain this grid in a bigger box and then make a grid of such containers, and so on", "comment_date": "2017-10-27T08:50:10Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Dill", "comment_text": "<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwAD6dRSVyI&amp;t=20m14s\">20:14</a> Start talking about hyperdimensional portals.

Speaking geometrically, each n-dimensional entity is made up of an infinite number of stacked (n-1)-dimensional entities. Basically, a square is made up of an infinite number of lines, a cube is made up of an infinite number of squares, and so on. Now, each time you stack a number of n-dimensional objects on top of each other, they tangent each other, but never touch. In terms of our world, that would mean parallel worlds are what make up the 4th dimension. Basically meaning, if we were able to move between parallel worlds, we&#39;d be moving along the 4th dimension, or the w axis.<br><br>But let&#39;s take a look at something else. Each n-dimensional entity basically &quot;limits&quot; the number of (n-1)-dimensional entities that fit within it based on the length of its nth dimension. That means that only a certain number of stacked (n-1)-dimensional entities make up an n-dimensional entity, whose size we decide based on the nth dimension of that entity. What that means is that while the nth dimension can&#39;t be perceived by the (n-1)-dimensional entity, the nth dimension still exists for it and goes through it. Now, by going through something, you&#39;re obviously going to decide something in it, and what dimensions are deciding is structure. For example, our 3-dimensional world only allows a fixed amount of 2-dimensional entities to &quot;exist&quot;. We can&#39;t create any new shape that&#39;s 2-dimensional. 2D entities are always going to be some type of polygon. That&#39;s what makes them 2D, it&#39;s their unique &quot;trait&quot;, their structure. I&#39;m using the world &quot;structure&quot; here for a reason. What structure do we have that might differentiate between parallel worlds and make similar parallel worlds able to be grouped up and put on an axis? Logical structure. We can be certain that there is an infinite number of parallel worlds in existence. If there was only 1 singular and rock solid logic, then there&#39;d be no room for any parallel worlds. Each decision we end up making, we make based on our own logical thinking and what we perceive as the best option. In a parallel world, we took the other option, because the logical structure there is ever so slightly different and we thought of the other option as the more logical one. The only thing that could differentiate parallel worlds in general is the logical structure of that world. The law of that world. That would mean that once we start moving across parallel worlds, once we start moving across the w axis, we&#39;ll see extremely similar worlds to our own at first, almost identical, as they are the closest to us by logical structure. Basically, the first quintillions of parallel worlds we go through are gonna have the most minute differences on the atomic level. It&#39;ll literally be a matter of if one single atom is 1e-99999999 m moved to either side of either the x, y or z axis compared to the parallel world you came from.<br><br>This also leads to my thoughts about the 5th dimension being time. Time will move in all of the parallel worlds we go through just the same as it is moving here. But in another set of infinite parallel worlds, time will move differently and that will differentiate the 4th dimensional &quot;universes&quot; from each other. At least that&#39;s my own thoughts on the matter.", "comment_date": "2017-09-02T23:34:45Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "U.N.

With 9 dimensions, the center of the outer spheres, which is centered at the point (1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1), is a distance of sqrt(9), or 3 units in radius away from the origin. Since we know that the radius of each outside sphere is 1, by definition, we know that the furthest point from the origin on any of the outside spheres is 3+1, or 4 units away from the origin. keep this in mind for later.<br><br>Keep in mind that the outer sphere is still centered at (1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1), despite that the distance between the center of that sphere and the origin is 3.<br><br>When looking at the point of intersection between the outside and the inside spheres, we can see that the dimensional component of any one of the dimensions between the point of intersection and the center of the outer sphere is sqrt(1/9). since we know that the total dimensional component of any dimension between the origin and the center of the outer sphere is 1, the dimensional component of any one of the dimensions of the inner sphere must be 1-sqrt(1/9). We can now use this dimensional component to calculate the radius of the inner sphere. Each dimension is 1-sqrt(1/9), so using the formula for distance, we can see the radius of the inner sphere is (((1 - sqrt(1/9))^2)*9). Since we know that the square root of 1/9 is 1/3, we can easily simplify this into (((1 - (1/3))^2)*9). Then we get (9*((2/3)^2)). Then 9*(4/9), which simplifies to 4. So in conclusion, the radius of the INNER sphere is 4. Remember from earlier how I noted that the furthest point from the origin on any of the inner sphere is 4 units away from the origin. The implication of this is that every OUTSIDE sphere is ENTIRELY INSIDE of the INSIDE sphere.

I&#39;m just not sure.<br>1. Is there dimension to a point? So, you have a number line, a simple x axis, you put two points on it and you get a line. But what if you only have one point? does  a point, without height, width or girth, just a point by itself have dimension? Afterall, without points, you have no shapes. <br>2. Is there &quot;negative dimension&quot; (I used quotes because I have no idea what I am talking about)? You take a few points and place them on an axis or two and you have a shape? what is everything else that is not the shape? Potential shape? or is the shape that is the shape finite, and it can only be the shape and everything that is not the shape can never be the shape?<br>3. Further on the negative: say you have a square. The square measure 1X1 of an arbitrary unit of measure. Everything inside of and the perimeter is that square. The square is placed at the coordinates (2,1)(2,2)(3,2)&amp;(3,1). That square is a 1x1 square and will always be a 1x1 square, potentially that square could be anywhere on a grid, but always 1x1. Is there a name for the possible squares it could be? (that last one, I&#39;m totally asking wrong)<br>4. Last question: what is a dimension? isn&#39;t that anything that we can use to measure something by? Height and width (or length) are two dimensions, Yes? and a depth is a third, then time. but what are the rest? mass, volume, weight? what about position and proximity to other objects? or albedo, reflectivity, pressure exerted on an area, translucence? are these dimensions too? what about period of existence? I will only exist for a period of time, it is measurable and (possibly) finite, but unlike time, or an object in motion, I am, then eventually I am not. <br>5.

it):<br><br>Imagine the background tessellated with equilateral triangles of sidelength AB (i.e. the radius of the two circles), using the points A and B as &quot;starting&quot; vertices. You&#39;d see a hexagon inscribed in each of the two circles. The intersection points of the two circles would also become vertices of the tessellation-triangles, because both of these two points are exactly one radius away from A and B. If you only concentrate on one circle, you can see that two inscribed triangles worth of angle get lost in terms of circle circumference. That is one third of the total circumference (2 triangles worth of circumference out of the 6 triangles making up the inscribed hexagon; other way to think: 2 triangles worth of angle are 120\u00b0 which is a third of 360\u00b0). Thus, the remaining circumference for each circle is 2/3 of it&#39;s original circumference. As we have two circles (one around A, one around B),  the red line (L) is 4/3 times the circle circumference. One circumference C=2*r*pi thus the red line<br>L = 4/3*2*r*pi = 8/3*r*pi Now we can plug in r=3 and get L=8*pi", "comment_date": "2017-08-12T16:26:51Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Matrix Master", "comment_text": "<b>Awesome!</b>", "comment_date": "2017-08-12T16:14:31Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Akshara Prasad", "comment_text": "This video is just amazing!

I just wanted to provide a way to still visualize the problem mentioned in the video that helped me to rationalize the size of the inner sphere. One thin that always stays 1-dimensional is the diagonal of one side of the d-dim box. In 2 dimensions this is just the actual edge, in 3 dimensions it is the diagonal of the face of the box and so on. The keypoint is that this diagonal has length 2*Sqrt[d-1] (d = dimension), whereas the outer spheres continue to have radius 1. <br>You can now draw a box with vertical length equal to 2*Sqrt[d-1] and horizontal length equal to 2 (the original length of the box) and 4 circles of radius 1 in each corner. The inner circle touches all 4, as postulated in the problem. It is clear from that picture, that the inner circle becomes larger and larger as the vertical side of the box (=the diagonal of the side of the box) grows with the dimension.<br>I don&#39;t know if it is any good, but this picture helped me to wrap my head around this dimensionality issue.", "comment_date": "2017-08-12T14:05:43Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Erick Lescano", "comment_text": "I think you missed a golden opportunity in calling the podcast 2Ben1Brown.

On top of that your method of visualizing higher dimensional space, while accurate, is also kind of counter-intuitive, at least to me. I repeatedly feel like I should really enjoy your videos, but rarely do I feel like what you do shows the beauty in math. for instance you don&#39;t really explain how your method helps understand the problem, you say you can know it is less than 0.5 for each bar, which I get why, and then you say for the fourth dimension it is at 0.5. Then you claim this is counter-intuitive, but easier to understand with bards than working it out, but really you just worked it out by knowing that 0.5 squared is 0.25 and that if you have 4 that is one, if you have less than 4 that is less than one, and if you have more than 4 it is more. that the radius is always  root n minus one is cool, and that the coordinates of the point closest to the origin on one of those higher dimensional spheres is 1-(2 over root n)+1/n is cool. Essentially I think the cool thing about math is generalizing a concept. First finding an idea, then modeling it, then finding a rule to follow to generalize it, and then determining why that rule works. Things being counter-intuitively related is not interesting to me, because of course they are, everything is counter-intuitive when you don&#39;t understand why it works, and unless I already know about the subject, your videos lose me on some of the reason it works, I can work it out sometimes, but you don&#39;t seem to be interested in the only part about math that kept me interested despite math classes sucking.", "comment_date": "2017-08-12T05:18:12Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Keda Pofeng", "comment_text": "Imagine if this guy was your math teacher...", "comment_date": "2017-08-12T05:10:20Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Dziban Molniya", "comment_text": "Watching this channel makes me think I wasted a lot of time and effort on my geology MS", "comment_date": "2017-08-12T05:09:47Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Younus Dar", "comment_text": "Actually Dimensions are just three we can use 3 and only 3 Dimensions , we can move only in 3 Dimensions all shapes of objects are made in three dimensions even a sphere is of 3 dimensions Directions are six and dimensions are three.
