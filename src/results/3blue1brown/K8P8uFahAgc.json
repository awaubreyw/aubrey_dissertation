So, was connect 21 to 20, that is 4 times 5 that is 20. And 36 that is 4 times 9. so the odd that is 4 as different number yet support next number that is even. 20 as divide that is 10 and 36 as divide that is 18, add all together that is 28, so it matches 7 * 4. So, it is odd and even that work together, so it has to be right even and right odd or can be any number. 4 plus 3 that is 7, so 3 is a fit number to 15. 5 is even to 7 that is 5 as odd number and source number, so out of source and even two with odd and even number. 6 on left and 4 on right. So, I guess 3 is connect to 180 so 3 times 6 that is 18. So, even that add 3 is odd or odd that add 3 is even. Well, the more there is a pattern, the more of deeper pattern that is smaller or different pattern that lead to understanding. So, 3 represent even if three interact. Pyramid math. And there is a pattern to 3 since the last row equal to 64, but 63 can be into 3, so it multiply nicely. And for each add for each row that is more than 3 is 2, 1, 2, 1. So, up to pattern of 3. 64 is not a multiply of 3, but 63 is, I didn&#39;t know but I was just subtract 63, 62 that add to 3 to see if it even out in multiply way. So, 1, 2, 3 are all important since 3 is total and result of previous two that is 1 and 2, 2 is a process of 1. 1 is the source that is odd. Well, it can be series process, series source, series of result, same as fractal pattern that is everything repeat at higher or lower scale. so shape that is square, circle, 90 degree triangle that is even horizontal and vertical and double that is square. So, all has 3 in it. 180 is connect to 3, 90 is connect to 3, 45 is connect to 3. 22.5 is connect to 3. So, divide of 2 that is 1 + 1, and repeat for other 2. 2 is even so it divide even that is two, left and right. 5 is odd so it divide that is odd that is 2, so it has 3. Divide of 5 is 3 + 2 as a side of two that is 5. So, there is logical and pattern, not random, so if it is seemingly random and that random do work so there is a pattern of logical so ya have to look for it. For 180 that is even in multiply and add that is 4 and 2, and between 4 and 2 is 3, so add and subtract 1 of two side that equal less or more than 3. 8 that is divide of two side that is 4 in add in even way, and divide that 4 in two side so it is even in multiply that is 2, 2 times 2 that is 4. 8 has two pattern that is even for multiply and add. 90 is not series of pattern of two, but one, 3 times 3 that is 9. For add that is 5 plus 4 that is 9, so between 5 and 4 is 3. So, 3 is a prime number, right? Or not, there is a pattern for prime number. 22.5 that means 2 is even pattern of two side in divide that is 1 + 1, but not multiply, but can change to add, 1 + 2 is 3. 5 is not even pattern of two that is either multiply and add, so 3 plus 2 that is 5. So, if there is even of two side and odd of two side, it would equal to 90 that is odd number, but has even number that is side of two in multiply of 3. It is about even and odd. Even is more important since circle is even as it seamless connect as external outline and internal lines from center to outward that is radius. So, there is different process for source, process, and result to get answer. So, it seems computer age that make people to love math because of pattern and understanding, without thinking in your mind that show picture in your mind, well, the mind and computer is same as you can see visually, but computer is easier. So, I am sure you can use the pattern of 1, 2, and 3 to get right answer as a correct. 15 is connect to source, the process of two even side that is 7.5, but 7.5 is not even as whole number, but odd, so 3 times 5 that is 15, so even divide of two of either 3 and 5, 3 do not have even process to smaller number, same as 5. So, 14 is not even up to 15, 30, 45, and 90 up to one whole circle that is 180. So, there is even of two side of same number that either can add or multiply. If both multiply and add with same number of two side that would equal to even shape. There are different pattern for different things and those different things can connect perhaps. I was looking at 1 + 2 = 3, that is series pattern, and it is even pattern of two for 3, 1 plus 1 that is 2, and 1 * 1 that is 1, so both total 3 in additional. 3 is connect to 90 as mention already, 2 is connect to 90 because it is even number, 5 is odd but even as double even after odd number, double 5 is 10 and it fit nicely to two, that is two of whole that in divide which is 10, well, it is 9 digits with 1 that is 10. 10 is closest to 9. What is closest is likely to be right. 1 is 1 * 1, even multiply;  2 is 1 + 1, even add; 3 is even multiply and even add. Even is same number; odd is different number, that work well in computer on and off, 1 and 0, even and odd, and so on, and connect to algebra that is balance which negative and positive.", "comment_date": "2018-04-02T01:14:49Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Jordan Croteau", "comment_text": "This is beautiful", "comment_date": "2018-03-31T23:08:55Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Stephen Woo", "comment_text": "Cool!

Excuse my bad English...<br><br>If you add one point to the circle, and connect it with every other point, the line drawn from the new point to a point already on the circle, cuts some amount of lines. And for each line you cross, you add one segment, plus one, which you get even without crossing lines. Since each pair of points is actually a line / every point is connected to every other point, the amount of lines you cross is equal to the count of points left of the newly added line times the count of points right of the line. So when you draw a line from the new point to the i-th &quot;old&quot; point of a total of n &quot;old&quot; points, you add<br>i*(n-i)+1<br>segments. Now sum that up for every n, and you get<br>\u03a3(i=0; n; i*n+i\u00b2+1) = (n\u00b3+5n+6)/6<br>This is the number of segments added by the (n+2)th point. Why n+2? Because we assumed that there were n &quot;old&quot; points on the left and right side, plus one &quot;old&quot; point we are connecting to. To calculate the total number of segments added so far, we have to sum up this number for every point added so far, plus 1, because the circle has one segment without any points on it, which gives us<br>1+\u03a3(i=0; n; (n\u00b3+5n+6)/6) = (n\u2074+2n\u00b3+11n\u00b2+34n+48)/24<br>But remember: this is for the (n+2)th point! If we replace n with n-2, we get:<br>(n\u2074-6n\u00b3+23n\u00b2-18n+24)/24<br>as the finished formula for calculating the number of segments in a circle with n points on it.<br>If you don&#39;t believe me or those weird numbers look unreliable, try putting some values in this formula: it works!<br><br><br>Edit: By now I realized other people got this too...

An embarrassing number of off-by-one errors latter, I got this expressed as: for the line from the new point to the j-th point (with j starting from 0) counterclockwise from the new point, the number of crossings is j*((n-2)-j).<br><br>This gives me that f(n) = f(n-1) + \u03a3 (j=0 --&gt; n-2)(j*((n-2)-j)+1).

Instead, I thought of (starting from a circle with 3 outer points) adding a point to the graph with n-1 points and finding the number of intersections this new point creates with the previous ones. I found that that number is constant over each of the previous points, so the total number of intersections for each of the points is g*(n-1-g) where n is the number of points from the previous graph and g is the grade of separation around the circle between the point in question and the newly added point, starting at 0. If you take the sum from g=0 to n-1 of g*(n-1-g), you get the number of intersection points this new point adds to the graph. Because we want the <b>total</b> number of intersections in the graph, we have to add up all intersections that were introduced earlier (starting with a graph of size n=3). In other words, you take the sum from n=3 to p of the sum from g=0 to n-1 of g*(n-1-g) where p is the number of points in the graph we are looking for. This equals 1/24 * (x-3)(x-2)(x-1)x, which also leads to the correct solution. Of course, the quadruplet solution is way more elegant and simpler.
