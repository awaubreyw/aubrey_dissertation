This set has infinitely many elements. To get the set of the &quot;allowed&quot; projections, you have to subtract the set of those projections, where any of the points and up on eachother. Take a look at every pair of points. Every pair defines a direction, that is not allowed. So buy collecting all of these directions we have a set of not allowed directions, subtract it from the original set. And since the set of not allowed projections was a finite set (it&#39;s easy to see), after the subtraction you still have infinitely many allowed projections.

In as non-rigorous of a way as possible, I&#39;ll see if I can come up with a proof. This is a sort of &quot;forest for the trees&quot; problem if allowed to approach infinity, but it is finite; there is &quot;light&quot; that all points can see that allows the rotation of the line l to change from one pivot to another without conflict (as would exist in a colinear set). Since line l must rotate in a consistent direction, and no more than three points are colinear, l can only change pivot from one point in set S (some Sx, where x is an arbitrary indicator of position) to another. The set S contains points S0, S1, S2... up to Sn, the last point in the set. Given the consistent direction of rotation of line l on any point in set S, there exists a cyclical  (like a deck of cards) sequential set of points in the rotation around any given point Sx that includes all other points in set S (set S-Sx). Because this sequential set S-Sx is unique to each point Sx and Sx is colinear with only one other point at a time, the point that follows in the rotation after a change in pivot point cannot be the previous pivot point. Because set S-Sx includes every other point in set S and the point that follows Sx in the pivot point in the sequence cannot pivot immediately to Sx (in any set with 3 or more points), the pivot must change to another point in the set S following the sequences of each point&#39;s rotations. Due to these being unique, cyclical sequences, the overarching cyclical sequence set must be a composition of each of the sequences S-S0 through S-Sn (sequence set So(S0-Sn)), which includes every point in the set S. This finite sequence is the rotation pattern that line l must follow, based on the rules of its rotation provided earlier. Because line l rotates infinitely many times, following a pivot change along the finite sequence So(S0-Sn), which includes all points in the set S, it must therefore cycle through every point infinitely many times.<br><br>This took about 15 minutes, and I&#39;m probably wrong, which is OK.

Whenever rotation brought a point on the \u03c0,3\u03c0/2 axis it would replace the previous point in the origin and the coordinates of the other points would change accordingly, thus by using complicated calculus, which I am not proficient in, I would prove that for n number of points the system would run through all possible(infinite) arrangements at least once. Perhaps I would use the fact that there&#39;s a finite and smaller subset of S containing all the triangles with the previous, current and succeeding pivot point at their corners...<br><br>Then I read the wording of the problem again looking for some helpful hint and realised there&#39;s much simpler solutions hinted at by the loose parameters given on the properties of S, other than collinearity.<br><br>With that in mind, any point arranged in a straight line along the horizontal axis would prove a deceptively easy solution. But there was the issue of collinearity. A hack of sorts might have been to introduce a small plus or minus deviation on the vertical axis.<br><br>Then, I thought what if the points were arranged in a way that traced the graph of the sine or cosine function but that would only do if the line &quot;l&quot; was of finite length, which again isn&#39;t specifically clarified.

I probably won&#39;t come up with what&#39;s in the video or even a viable solution at all(I&#39;m not very formally trained in math and am pretty young) but we&#39;ll see where it goes. You can continue if you feel like reading<br>edit: just finished the video, my proof works but its a far cry from the elegance of the one shown. <br><br>The first thing I notice is if the points make a convex polygon then the problem is already solved, the line will just rotate around the given points. This immediately means that any combination of 1, 2, or 3 points will follow this rule. The first time we see an instance of a set of dots that may not follow this rule is when we have four points. If three form a convex triangle and the remaining point is inside that triangle and you start at a point on the triangle you will not follow the rule. This of course then means that we must start from the point within the triangle. When we do this we find that it is possible to satisfy this condition. This means all 4 point systems satisfy the condition.   So far I have shown that any set of points:<br><br>*That form a convex polygon<br>or/and<br>*is of length 1,2,3,4<br>must satisfy the condition. <br><br>Here I think the problem can be restated slightly: At all points, there must be a loop through which you can return to your original point, this loop may not hit every point but there must be at least one for every point. So the proof becomes showing that for any set of points there cannot be a point that has no loop back to itself. Another way I may be able to prove this is by showing that if an N dot system has a solution then an N+1 dot system must also have a solution. I&#39;ve got some options for where to go with this proof as of now. <br><br>I&#39;ve been thinking and I&#39;ve realized that any system with N-1 dots making a convex polygon and 1 dot in the interior will also satisfy the condition. To prove this let&#39;s go back to my first statement that if all dots have some path back to themselves the condition is satisfied, I can show that this is true in the setup I just mentioned, firstly all N-1 can reach back to themselves by simply traversing along the convex polygon (remember the path doesn&#39;t have to touch every point there just has to be one such loop for every point) and the center point will have a path back to itself in 3 steps [inner point -&gt; outer point 1 -&gt; outer point 2 -&gt; inner point], therefore the entire system will repeat.   <br><br>I think I&#39;ve found something more general, I need to think a bit but this might be it. Ok, so the only way that a set of points does not satisfy the condition is if there is some convex polygon that the line rotates around and every other point is inside that polygon, there is no other way for the condition not to be satisfied. I can prove this, <br> Imagine a set of points P_0, ..., P_n that form a convex polygon, if a point P_j is added on the outside of the polygon then it will be hit no matter what because in order to hit points P_0 through P_n it must loop, meaning the line will turn 180 degrees and in doing so must hit P_j no matter where it is outside the polygon.<br>So let&#39;s try to prove that every point must have a loop through which it returns to itself. Let&#39;s assume a set of points P_0 through P_n and let&#39;s start at an arbitrary point P_j, from here one of two things can happen either:<br>*The line returns to P_j in which case the proof is done<br>*The line rotates around every point other than P_j in a convex polygon with P_j inside.<br><br>But as I have already shown the setup in which we start at an inner point surrounded by a convex polygon must hit all points.<br>QED <br><br>I don&#39;t think this is 100% solid but it&#39;s alright", "comment_date": "2021-03-12T21:11:45Z", "likes_count": 4}, {"comment_by": "Sorin Jayaweera", "comment_text": "I don&#39;t know why but that ending had me BALLING, crying my eyes out.

When I tried to solve it, I got around to saying : <br>The path the line is likely to follow is manily dependent on 2 things - the choice of the origin point and the orientation of the line. Checking the conditions for which the required result would not hold true:<br><br>1. If the axis of rotation of the line ends up tracing a polygon in the given points, any point inside a cyclic polygon would remain untouched, hence the area of the cyclic polygon should tend to zero, therefore the initial pivot should be as close to the &quot;middle &quot; of the scatter of points.  This &quot;Middle&quot; I tried to define as if graph was drawn such that the x and y axis were drawn in a way that all the points in S fall in quadrant 1, the point that is closest to (ymean and xmean) of all points should be chosen as the pivot. To visualize it take any randome scatter plot of graphs. Connect the outermost points into a polygon, then connect the ones inside, then inside those until the centre ones remain. Picking one of those would generally satisfy our original condition.<br><br>2.  At any point, if the line touches a point in such a way that it shifts into a polygon and remains so. This would happen if the distribution of the dots is such that some are very far away and off to the side and there are some clusters here and there. In such a situation, reverting to our original graph, one might analyze the mean, media and mode and the point closest to the place where all 3 of them tend to converge would give you a &quot;good&quot; starting position.<br><br>Note that, &quot;the number or blue points and brown points remain the same&quot; does not hod true for true for ANY position that has been selected such that the intitial distribution of dots is equal on either side. The point is that the distribution of said dots must remain fairly equal on eother side of the line in ALL orientations of the line one could have at that point. The point is that if you select a pivot on the outside, certain points Will not change colour. The &quot;bottom&quot; part of the line, if there is any such thing of a rotating line, would only touch those points that are outside the polygon traced by the line. Therefore, I Find simply saying &quot;the dots on either side should be equal slightly lacking because that might be problematic in certain kinds of distributions.<br><br>Ergo, it is not about the points on sides of the line but &quot;inside&quot; and &quot;outside&quot; the path traced by its axis. Therefore the path should be such that at least each point falls outside the plygon atleast once. Now how on earth is that possible?<br><br>Lets try an exercise. take five points. start on the edge and start the pivot. The next point it hits, draw a line from the initial point to the second one. When it hits a third point draw a line joining the second and the 3rd. bAsically join n-1th point to the nth point it touches and dont stop when it reaches the first point. This is the path of the axis of rotaion. Do a few rounds. When you start on the outside, it forms a neat little polygon. Now take the same points and pick a point to the middle - you will notice that the line will (cut through/slice through) the neat shape of the polygon at certain places and form a shape like the arm of a star (or a complex polygon) The actual idea is that the line should cut through the polygon and form a star shape continuously. I don&#39;t know the mathematics of this, but it seems like sometimes, you can get the dots divided into two separate polygons and the line might stick to one side after cover the other one only once. Therefore, the more &quot;cuts&quot; you have in the polygon the more &quot;complex&quot; a polygon is, the better chances of the required condition being satisfied. In other words, the line should continue to cut through the potential polygons that can otherwise potentially trap it in a cyclical motion. The more such points are, the better the chances of the requirement being fulfilled.<br><br>And we find that the probability of that happening is the highest when the point is chosen is closer to the mean, median and mode of the points. Imagine it iike this. Let this point be O. And let us draw concentric circles around O. The dots that fall in the smallest circle have the highest probability of satisfying the condition. The points on the outer circles, are less likely to do so. Note, there will be some set of dots where they might satisfy the conditions but the probabiblity would continue to decrease as we move outwards.<br><br>Another way of thiking about this is - when you watch the line rotate through many cycles, you will notice that there are points that it traverses more frequently than others. You will notice that the number of times the line passes through the points at the centre (the number of times those dots change colour) is more frequent than the ones on the outside. If I did a gradient colour (dark blue for the most frequently colour changing and white for the ones that dont), it would form a gradient such that the blue colour would be inside and will get lighter and lighter outside. When you pick other points, as initial pivots, these points will have a different sort of gradient.<br><br>Interestingly, this reminds me of that squared thing tracing fractals for some reason. I mean, to be honest, I think this seems to be useful in maybe trying to figure our random motion of points in space or higher-d geometry or something. maybe like the butterfly effect or something. I don&#39;t know if any of my ramblings have any actual relation to stuff I am talking about though. I am not even close to a mathematician tbh.<br><br>Edit: Just realized - This is very similar to the idea of the pendulum motion in 3d space. If the pendulum traces a circle by its motion, it tends to remain in that circle, if it doesnt. then it continues to follow a random pattern. It is very very similar to that. I mean a circle is nothing but a regular polygon with infinitely many sides. No wonder, I kept calling the polygons I am talking about &quot;cyclic polygons&quot; in my head.", "comment_date": "2021-02-18T16:51:47Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "\u0415\u0432\u0433\u0435\u043d\u0438\u0439 \u041c\u0438\u0445\u0430\u0439\u043b\u043e\u0432\u0438\u0447 \u0420\u0443\u0434\u043e\u0439", "comment_text": "ja, est super", "comment_date": "2021-02-18T11:31:50Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Grizzlybearr0139", "comment_text": "Mathematical Aesop, not a mathematical Don Quixote.

Not that I came anywhere near to figuring this out but have been trying to visualize like 3B1B has taught us well and came up with another visualization. Here goes: Imagine the random set of points are projected onto the surface of a sphere not a plane. The property of a plane makes it such that some points are outsiders and some points are insiders (I am sure that can be expressed better mathematically) but that would cease to be true on a sphere. Now choose a point to begin with and rotate the sphere as if that point were a pole. As a pole, it would have infinite planes that run through it that bisect the sphere. Chose a plane or line of longitude that makes sure half the points are on one side and half on the other (assuming odd number of points). Now rotate the sphere until another point lines up on that line of longitude. Now switch, make the new point the pole and continue rotating <b>in the same direction.</b> This new pole also has infinite lines of longitude running through it that bisects the sphere and one of them, joined with the first point also keeps all the points divided equally between the two hemispheres. Keep rotating and repeating. Now how do we know we can reach all the points this way? Another way of thinking of the rotation is actually shrinking the sphere. I don&#39;t know how to say this precisely but we choose to shrink the sphere symmetrically about the plane that bisects the hemispheres with equal points on each side. We shrink until another points lies on the plane of bisection. Then we turn slightly to release the first point from the plane of bisection and only one point, the new point lies on the plane of bisection. Then we continue to shrink the sphere until a new point hits the plane. It seems to me that because of topology and the nature of the sphere so long as we always release the original point to the same side of the line of longitude, a new point will hit the new plane of bisection. It is the equivalent of saying in rotational logic that if I have points scattered on an X-Y plane, and I pass a line across the plane in any direction except parallel to the line, that that line will touch all the points. Provided that line moves both along a line and then in the opposite direction. The nature of a closed sphere provides that the line doesn&#39;t have to move one direction and then another but all the points can be joined topologically to the other points on a sphere in two directions. It seems to me that this is another way of saying that all points on the surface of a sphere converge if the sphere shrinks towards its center. Does that work? Is this the right place to even discuss this thought? It also seems to me that if we thought about the plane as closed that we could chose any point as our beginning point and the rotating axis would hit all points. One more thought that occurred to me from thinking about this problem is the nature clockwise or CCW rotation. There is nothing in a sphere that would indicate what direction it should rotate. And every time we release point from the plane of symmetry to find a new plane of symmetry we need to release that point in the same direction. But that direction has no indication from the nature of the shape at present, only our memory of the previous action keeps us on track. The CW or CCW rotation being an independent quality maintained throughout the problem. One of those constants Grant was talking about going to the heart of the problem.", "comment_date": "2020-11-08T04:38:45Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Rador Dekeche", "comment_text": "The real question is; is there some region on plane S, that the windmill will not move through?

Let\u2019s assume this statement is false. Then, when a line starts to rotate, it covers every single space in the plane that does not belong to a line between the pivot and the second point. If the third point is not collinear with the other two, then it lays in the space outside of the upper-mentioned line between the two points. If we have a condition, that a line stops when it meets the other point, then, if it covers every single space outside of the between-point line, it MUST encounter the third point (since the third point does not belong to that line). This leads us to an idea, that the line will stop as many times, as the number of elements in the set is (the point does not become a pivot some times in a row, if the pivot is not the only one in the plane; the fact, that if the third point is not collinear to the others, then the line MUST stop at that point). And, if the process continues indefinitely, each point of the set will be encountered by the line infinitely many times.<br><br><br><br>(Sorry for any possible grammar mistakes, I\u2019m not a native speaker)<br>Grant, if you\u2019re reading this, I would be really grateful if you could tell me whether I am right or not.

The pivot change happens immediately, so the area the line covers during that swap is infinitesimal and will only contain further colinear points. Since all 3rd colinear points are excluded, the line can not jump over any points and therefore will hit all of them.

And after 180 degrees, everything must have switched sides of the line, and since the only way to change sides of the line is to be touched, everything was touched by the line. When it&#39;s an even number, you choose a point so that there&#39;s one more on one side, we&#39;ll call that side A (which is continuously defined relative to the line as the line rotates). After rotating 180 degrees, the line has to have shifted to one point over toward where side A was originally so that there will still be one more point on side A now, and since the initial and final points were clearly touched (and all the others switched sides) all must have been touched. And then you can see the line will go back to its oriignal position after another 180 in order to ensure side A still has one more point in it.

Given a distance you want to travel, a maximum allowable jerk, acceleration, and velocity, how do you create a set of points along a trajectory where each point defines the position, velocity, acceleration, and jerk of the particle (I&#39;ve seen you animate such position curves in your own videos)? I&#39;m having trouble understanding how you determine the time required for such a trajectory before generating it, and how to calculate the maximum reachable jerk/acceleration/velocity in the case that they do not saturate to the maximum allowed jerk/acceleration/velocity. I&#39;ve heard of approaches that use two FIR filters to treat such a problem as signal processing, where you give an initial position pulse, and then implement a box-car filter (ie low-pass? I think?) in order to smooth out the position pulse to have smooth velocity and acceleration. I don&#39;t understand how to determine the filter lengths in this case, and how you might deal with a situation where your initial velocity and acceleration conditions are not equal to the final conditions. <br><br><br>This is becoming a rather long comment, but I wanted to ask you something else. I&#39;m not sure if you&#39;ve heard of the following organizations: FIRST Robotics and Vex Robotics. They enable teams of students from schools across the world to build robots that accomplish some game task and then compete against each other. In recent years, motion planning and vision processing have been getting more and more sophisticated within these communities. As a result, the teams with the most resources to people that understand these concepts have a rather large advantage over those who don&#39;t. People have been abstracting such mathematics into libraries that do the motion planning for you, yet these tools can only be fully utilized/extended with knowledge of how they work under the hood. In my opinion, this is ultimately a good thing, but it&#39;s taking the learning out of the robotics organizations with the benefit of equalized resources. It would be awesome if you could do a video series on the theory and mathematics behind different control structures/algorithms. Simple PID, introducing feed-forward terms, how to generate trajectories in 1 and 2 dimensions, how to model motor dynamic, etc. There are hundreds of thousands of students who would benefit greatly from such educational resources. At the moment, the best resources are technical white-papers that are inaccessible to students without experience in the notation of higher-level mathematics or even basic calculus.

I haven&#39;t gone past the problem explanation, and I came up with a solution(not a proof). We&#39;re talking about a finite set of points in space, so each point has a set of coordinates and none of them are off an infinite distance away. this means that the set has a perimeter, or that there is a set of points that make up a polygon with no outward-facing angles which contains the rest of the set of points. the remaining set of points has its own perimeter, and so on until we hit the center set. if we start out crossing the center set or on the center point, then we must have been able to take some path to get there center point. if the path rotating in one direction devolves into a pattern without hitting the starting point, then it cannot in the other direction and have ever hit the starting point. there is a finite number of combinations of points and parts of the space for the line to sweep, and windmilling will always hit the same point next if we are sweeping the same space from the same point in the same set of points, therefore there are not non-repeating paths and any path with a forward pattern must follow the same pattern reversed if the rotation is reversed. this also means that any combination of point and swept space cannot be shared by two paths around the same set of points. for each perimeter shape, there is some starting point and direction which allows us to sweep the entire interior of the perimeter. if we sweep the entire interior of a perimeter, then all of the space will have been swept, and all points will be hit in a repeating pattern. if we place a perimeter set inside of this perimeter set and start without the line crossing the inner perimeter, then the line will sweep the same area, except missing the space contained by the inner set. therefore if we start crossing the inner set the line cannot escape the inner set, and all of the space will be swept. if all of space is swept, then we can repeat this line of thinking to each further inner perimeter. a set with a center point instead of a center set can be swept by starting on the center point.", "comment_date": "2019-09-11T00:44:36Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Naetheras", "comment_text": "I&#39;ve been told that i could do amazing things with my intellect and should apply for mensa and shit. <br><br>I dont understand any of this. <br><br>I knew i was retarded but not THAT retarded x(", "comment_date": "2019-09-10T23:46:03Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "AntiTheory", "comment_text": "&quot;The solution is something that anyone watching this video can understand.&quot;<br><br><br>You&#39;re giving me way too much credit, pal.", "comment_date": "2019-09-10T22:13:16Z", "likes_count": 23}, {"comment_by": "gtgaxiola", "comment_text": "<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M64HUIJFTZM&amp;t=1m32s\">1:32</a> Two points IN the plane.", "comment_date": "2019-09-10T21:21:41Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "BMWE36", "comment_text": "Well?

After some refinement I think it is.  Though the argument gets a bit more complex than what&#39;s needed to solve the problem as stated. But I fleshed this out anyway.<br><br>For simplicity we admit the notion of a slope of infinity, which is the slope of a vertical line. So the set of all slopes is R + infty, which we hand-wavy regard as possessing the topology of a circle. Every pair of points has a well-defined and unique slope. Let L be the subset of slopes that do NOT correspond to the slope of a pair of points. L is composed of a finite number of connected components.<br><br>For each point P in S and each slope t in L define the t-depth of P to be the smaller of the number of the points on either side of the line with slope t passing through P. It&#39;s clear the t-depth of any point is constant on each component of L. Every point has a maximal t-depth that&#39;s about half the number of points minus 1. Define the depth of a point P to be the minimum of its t-depth over all t in L. The depth of a point P is roughly the number of successive convex hulls you&#39;d have to remove from S in order for P to be in the convex hull of the remaining points.<br><br>To guarantee every point is a pivot infinitely many times the starting point doesn&#39;t matter. All that matters is that for the point P you pick, you start with an initial slope t such that the t-depth of P is at least the maximal depth taken over all the points in S. This could be far from dividing the other points into two equal-sized sets<br><br>For instance, if S is composed of 8 points whose coordinates are all signed combinations of (+/-1, +/-1) and (+/-0.9, +/-0.9). The maximal depth is 1. Your starting point could be the point (1,1) but you have to choose a starting line slope that, at least, separates one of the two adjacent big-square vertices from the rest of the points. Such as a slope of 100. So the line always divides the 7 non-pivot points into a set of 6 and 1, but still hits every point every full rotation because every point has a direction that contains at most 1 other point of S.", "comment_date": "2019-09-02T02:28:03Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Just Ed", "comment_text": "Wouldn&#39;t it be easier to graph a circle, select a finite amount of points to that circle to represent S, and make sure that the line P would be a tangent to the original circle?", "comment_date": "2019-09-02T02:17:34Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Renz Rallion Gomez", "comment_text": "I just saw the application of this in my research about algorithms.

Putting enough variants to find the invariance to paper looks like such a difficult task, especially considering the fact that they also need to complete the other 2 problems in the same 4.5 hours. Though I personally believe that in tests giving a set period of time for any more than 1 question is just a flawed concept as some students will get hung up on a specific question possibly missing out on answering easier questions, while you could say &#39;well that&#39;s why you should move on if you don&#39;t know the answer&#39;, but that&#39;s not necessarily good for a lot of students as their thoughts on the skipped parts can interfere with further problems, as well as the fact that moving on might make them lose their train of thought on the excercise which they might have almost solved. It also builds a flaw into a students thought processes where they are skipping solving a difficult problem where they might learn something if they solved it, meanwhile they complete the easy excercises and learn nothing. It&#39;s a complex issue and is very hard to solve of course, therefore I&#39;m glad that there&#39;s at least very few, but hard problems in this competition that scale in difficulty rather than a large amount of random short problems with varied difficulty even if it is hard to determine difficulty in mathematical problems.", "comment_date": "2019-08-29T20:28:20Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Spacenorman", "comment_text": "Does this mean we can get this as a gif?", "comment_date": "2019-08-29T18:57:56Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "ImSupersane", "comment_text": "Is this a tough question??<br><b>Yesnt</b>", "comment_date": "2019-08-29T17:10:43Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "shimona", "comment_text": "ah yes, I understand now, thanks!

The problem is that math curriculum does not teach what math is REALLY ABOUT: problem solving. And I don\u2019t mean rehearsing formulas on a paper to solve problems. I mean videos like these, with creative solutions to creative problems that make you think outside the box. In my experience taking tests, \u201cthinking outside the box\u201d always meant searching my brain for an old formula or rule I was taught a while ago and forgot about. Math classes are too focused on rules and formulas. It\u2019s more like rehearsing lines than learning how to use your brain. It\u2019s no wonder so few people can solve these problems: they were never taught to THINK!

have this non-square procedural generator I&#39;m developing and planning, and as part of that the landscape is generated first with rock that are immovable and doodads that can be removed. Then I generate a city on top of that with buildings with doors. The buildings are on a blueprint with a footprint around each building that must not intersect an immovable rock and must be X number of units away from the nearest building and x number of units away from the nearest immovable rock. The script spawns the blueprint on the possible coordinates of a pre-placed mountains, and then moves the buildings away from the rocks to not intersect. <br><br>Okay, that&#39;s the scatter plot. <br><br>Now each building has a doorway that leads to a parametric path to all other doorways on the local map (so NPCs generated within each building can spawn and travel to all other buildings on the map with no pathing errors.) And most towns have a central well, or common &quot;town center&quot; which all paths lead to. (the paths are just splines that project a dirt or flagstone texture onto the terrain and allow for a navmesh for npcs to prioritize.)<br><br>Each building has a rotation on a pivot, and that pivot needs to, in certain town types (the circular caravan camp with tents all facing inwards comes to mind) match the pivot of the other doorways, so they all more or less point to one another. <br><br>No building that spawns may intersect the path to another building, either. So if a building is placed on the map, displaced by terrain, then moved into the path of another building, moved further away from the central pivot of the town footprint. And if no further point is reachable, that was an error, so I culled the building and removed it from the formlist of building types available in this town (and if the town generated was meant to have a farmer, everyone in this town would stave. :p Oops.)<br><br>So that created this problem.

But. The problem lies in the basic assumption that no three points are colinear. We need to prove that if there was a third point that was colinear, there would exist a point, in which we would stop and start turning arount it and the other points that are colinear, hence never reaching some other point of the set(ideally none other point in the set than those three colinear, which can be done if the three points are super-far away from the rest of the set). How would I approach to this: I would use the proof of contradiction. I would try to say, OK, lets assume, that three points are colinear in the set. Lets prove, that the process stops after a few turns and then starts turning around the same points and there is some point that experiences only a finite number of turns. Lets try to solve this for only three points. They are colinear, so there is the third point, the center point, that never becomes a pivot. Problem solved. Now try to solve it for N points. Graphically, it makes absolute sense for me... Hmmm....<br>edit: oh, well, wording again... My proof of contradiction would be way harder than a constructive proof and I wouldn&#39;t have done it in 4.5h... I guess I lose then... :D Maybe. I didn&#39;t solve it yet.

In the sequel, the word\r<br>collision will be used to denote meeting of exactly two ants, moving in opposite directions.\r<br>If at the beginning we place an ant on the southwest corner square facing east and an ant on\r<br>the southeast corner square facing west, then they will meet in the middle of the bottom row\r<br>at time m\u22121\r<br>2\r<br>. After the collision, the ant that moves to the north will stay on the board for\r<br>another m \u2212\r<br>1\r<br>2\r<br>time units and thus we have established an example in which the last ant falls\r<br>off at time m\u22121\r<br>2 + m \u2212\r<br>1\r<br>2 =\r<br>3m\r<br>2 \u2212 1. So, we are left to prove that this is the latest possible\r<br>moment.\r<br>Consider any collision of two ants a and a\r<br>\u2032\r<br>. Let us change the rule for this collision, and enforce\r<br>these two ants to turn anticlockwise. Then the succeeding behavior of all the ants does not\r<br>change; the only difference is that a and a\r<br>\u2032\r<br>swap their positions. These arguments may be\r<br>applied to any collision separately, so we may assume that at any collision, either both ants\r<br>rotate clockwise or both of them rotate anticlockwise by our own choice.\r<br>For instance, we may assume that there are only two types of ants, depending on their initial\r<br>direction: NE-ants, which move only north or east, and SW-ants, moving only south and west.\r<br>Then we immediately obtain that all ants will have fallen off the board after 2m \u2212 1 time\r<br>units. However, we can get a better bound by considering the last moment at which a given\r<br>ant collides with another ant.\r<br>Choose a coordinate system such that the corners of the checkerboard are (0, 0), (m, 0), (m, m)\r<br>and (0, m). At time t, there will be no NE-ants in the region {(x, y): x + y &lt; t + 1} and no\r<br>SW-ants in the region {(x, y): x + y &gt; 2m \u2212 t \u2212 1}. So if two ants collide at (x, y) at time t,\r<br>we have\r<br>t + 1 \u2264 x + y \u2264 2m \u2212 t \u2212 1. (1)\r<br>35\r<br>C5 Combinatorics \u2013 solutions 52nd IMO 2011\r<br>Analogously, we may change the rules so that each ant would move either alternatingly north\r<br>and west, or alternatingly south and east. By doing so, we find that apart from (1) we also\r<br>have |x \u2212 y| \u2264 m \u2212 t \u2212 1 for each collision at point (x, y) and time t.\r<br>To visualize this, put\r<br>B(t) = \r<br>(x, y) \u2208 [0, m]\r<br>2\r<br>: t + 1 \u2264 x + y \u2264 2m \u2212 t \u2212 1 and |x \u2212 y| \u2264 m \u2212 t \u2212 1\r<br> \r<br>.\r<br>An ant can thus only collide with another ant at time t if it happens to be in the region B(t).\r<br>The following figure displays B(t) for t =\r<br>1\r<br>2\r<br>and t =\r<br>7\r<br>2\r<br>in the case m = 6:\r<br>Now suppose that an NE-ant has its last collision at time t and that it does so at the point (x, y)\r<br>(if the ant does not collide at all, it will fall off the board within m\u2212\r<br>1\r<br>2 &lt;\r<br>3m\r<br>2 \u22121 time units, so this\r<br>case can be ignored). Then we have (x, y) \u2208 B(t) and thus x+y \u2265 t+1 and x\u2212y \u2265 \u2212(m\u2212t\u22121).\r<br>So we get\r<br>x \u2265\r<br>(t + 1) \u2212 (m \u2212 t \u2212 1)\r<br>2\r<br>= t + 1 \u2212\r<br>m\r<br>2\r<br>.\r<br>By symmetry we also have y \u2265 t+ 1\u2212\r<br>m\r<br>2\r<br>, and hence min{x, y} \u2265 t+ 1\u2212\r<br>m\r<br>2\r<br>. After this collision,\r<br>the ant will move directly to an edge, which will take at most m \u2212 min{x, y} units of time. In\r<br>sum, the total amount of time the ant stays on the board is at most\r<br>t + (m \u2212 min{x, y}) \u2264 t + m \u2212\r<br>\r<br>t + 1 \u2212\r<br>m\r<br>2\r<br>\r<br>=\r<br>3m\r<br>2\r<br>\u2212 1.\r<br>By symmetry, the same bound holds for SW-ants as well.", "comment_date": "2019-08-10T01:45:37Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "The Teen Engineer", "comment_text": "Okidoki", "comment_date": "2019-08-10T01:39:23Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Ajay Banstola", "comment_text": "Get this comment to the top so he knows that we want more MACHINE LEARNING videos.", "comment_date": "2019-08-10T01:06:15Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Grant O\u2019Neill", "comment_text": "Why can\u2019t you just make a circle with all the points?", "comment_date": "2019-08-10T00:40:58Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Sebastian Cavanaugh", "comment_text": "Maybe I&#39;m just not smart with this hard math, but when you explain it like that it doesn&#39;t seem like that hard of a problem.

I framed things from a theta definition and searched for some way to construct symmetry or invariants.

I then tried to arrange the components as a boundary problem with three regions and two phases, the latter being the point collision and a travel phase. I parsed the solution as each point has a closest point in theta that isn&#39;t collinear, then considered a full cycle using the obvious corollary that if it goes through each point over a finite number of rotations, it must go through each infinitely. I think what then made it obvious to me was thinking of the problem on the plane at a far distance from all points and what a rotation around a &quot;center of mass&quot; would look like.

Test it for yourself if you don&#39;t already find it obvious. get a bit of paper and put dots on it. Then get a pencil and rotate it on a random point on the paper and no matter where it is it will point to every dot on the paper, if we know this then we know that the position of the line is irrelevant to the question. btw If this was said later on in the video i have no idea I only watched to <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M64HUIJFTZM&amp;t=3m59s\">3:59</a> but honestly its a stupidly simple question that I could answer in primary school.

Studying will give you the known correct method to solve known problems, but will not prepare you for new problems, or even won&#39;t guarantee that you understand the method you learnt, understanding is a student&#39;s own concern. <br>While someone studies, one will rarely also develop things like inspiration, creativity, ingenuity and talent that can&#39;t be studied (although could be encouraged to maximise and develop available potential), and often people that studied a lot don&#39;t have these attributes at all and are mistaken for those that do have them. I knew people that had excellent grades in school, but didn&#39;t really have a clue about most of what they &quot;knew&quot;. And excellent students usually make excellent employees, but don&#39;t make good innovators, or influence change in the society, even make lousy managers.

I suspect there&#39;s a hole in what I did somewhere. If anyone is up for reading through it and pointing out issues, I&#39;d very much appreciate it:<br><br>1. The line will turn forever since we&#39;ve defined no state where it stops turning.<br>2. Once the line has turned 180deg from its starting orientation, its ends will have swept the entire space of the plane.<br>3. For any finite set of points, the set of all ways of traversing some or all of those points must be itself finite. Thus traversing the points infinitely (as our line will do, per point 1) necessitates that the path of the traverse will settle into a loop which it repeats infinitely.<br><br>We can also show that not only must the path settle into this loop, it begins on the loop:<br><br>4. Since as specified, no three points lie on the same line, there is only ever one &#39;next&#39; point for the turning line to hit. It will never strike two at the same time.<br>5. Mirroring S gives a dual space S&#39; which behaves under clockwise rotation exactly as S would behave under anticlockwise rotation.<br>6. Taking 4 &amp; 5 together, there is only ever one previous point for the line to have hit, thus it must not merely settle into a loop, but begin on it.<br><br>7. From the above, we now know that for any set of points S, there is at least a subset of S (subS) for which the criteria of every point being hit infinitely is true.<br><br>8. When completing one traverse of subS, by which we mean both arriving back at the starting point P, and with the line l in in its starting orientation, we know both that l has turned 360deg, and that the point of rotation has traced a path through every point in subS. In the same way that the line rotating 360deg about a single point will sweep the plane (twice), in this case the line has swept all of the plane with the exception of the subspace bounded by the points in subS.<br>9. From this we conclude that for any traversable loop, no points can lie outside the path of the loop and not themselves belong to the loop.<br><br>This still leaves us with the possibility of a point inside the bounds of the loop which isn&#39;t touched. Let&#39;s clear those guys up.<br><br>10. If one or more points exists within the subspace bounded by subS, and it doesn&#39;t belong to subS, we choose one such point as our new starting point P&#39; and begin again.<br>11. As P&#39; lay inside the bounds of subS, all points in subS lay outside P&#39;. By statement 9 we therefore know that any traversable loop from P&#39; also includes all points in subS.<br><br>12. Since there are only finite points, and the interior of the subspace bounded by the new loop from P&#39; is itself a subspace of the original subspace subS belonging to our first choice of P, we can iterate this method finitely many times until we settle onto a point for which no other points lie within the subspace bounded by a legal loop from that point, which it concert with statement 9 tells us that a loop from that point must take in every point, and, by statement 3, that loop occurs infinitely, thus solving our original question.<br><br>(What makes me think there must be some mistake here is that the orientation of l through P doesn&#39;t even seem to matter by this solution.)", "comment_date": "2019-08-07T06:12:44Z", "likes_count": 2}, {"comment_by": "Daniel Jacobson", "comment_text": "Is anybody else really super curious what Question 5 looks like?

I also wrotee about what a good teacher is, and a terrible teacher is.  A good teacher can recognize the errors in the question and rather than giving zero for the assigned question, the teacher attempts to follow the students thought process of the question, which you know the student may be wrong or the question is poorly written. So the concision of a question for the English is more important to be concise and along the terms with math. and so I stated that a solution to remove ambiguity is to have a separate book that states the  definition of each term used and expands the language of the  math question in question. There is no ambiguity to the interpretation of the question then, thus students if stuck not on the question per-say but its meaning can go to the book that expands the question in language that defines what its asking in the question.  Is stated also the current system only finds like minded humans that think around the same terms. Meaning they often have collective blind spots.

Took me about 10 minutes to come up with a workable proof. If I had to write it down it would take a little longer, but still not too long. <br>Thing is, my proof was completely different. Started with a similar process but I went in a completely different direction:<br><br>When there&#39;s only two points then it&#39;s trivial. Every possible line is going to alternate between both points. Expand to 3 points. Since they aren&#39;t colinear they must form a triangle. So now you&#39;re effectively got 2 possible starting lines. From one point, either it goes outside the triangle or it goes between the other 2 points through the middle of the triangle. Coincidentally, both of those lines still cycle through all 3 points. When you get to 4 is when it starts getting complicated. Now your 4-sided figure can be convex (in which case any line still works) or one of the points can make a concavity in which case a line around the outside will miss that point, but any line through the middle, even if it doesn&#39;t start on that point directly, will eventually get to it, and to all the other 3.<br>(At this point I started off on an incorrect path so I&#39;ll skip to the part where I came back to the proof that actually works). As we keep adding points our N-Sided figure expands to become larger and eventually approaches a circle. Well, a really warped, irregular loop that&#39;s not necessarily circular but still conceptually similar. So let&#39;s draw an actual circle. But S had to be finite, so we can just make it a ring of discrete points. If we include the center point and draw a line to any point of the ring, no 3 points can be colinear (initial conditions) so the opposite side of the ring won&#39;t have a point there, and you get a special instance of the set S where all the points form a ring with one additional point at the exact center. It&#39;s not hard to visualize a windmill like through that center point and see that it&#39;s going to hit a periphery point, break off the center and move to hit a point on the opposite side. Then it breaks off the near side point and moves to either hit the center again or to hit the next point on the ring. So consider both cases: if it hits the center point then you effectively return to the initial position and it continues indefinitely. If it hits a ring point instead then it&#39;ll switch and go to the next far side ring point, switch again, and possibly hit the center point again. But is it possible that it will keep hitting ring points and never come back to the center? Well, no. In order for that to happen each time it moves along the far side of the ring it has to go farther along the arc than it does along the near side. Repeat this enough times and the line has to catch up with itself and get to where it&#39;s at two adjacent points, leaving no other option than to move back to the center point again. So here we have proved that in the special case of S where you have a ring of points and the center point there will always be a solution. <br>Now consider taking one point of that ring and moving it out some arbitrary distance from the ring. Does this change the action of the windmill? The windmill moves from the preceding point toward where the ring point would be and again we have two cases. Either it&#39;s pivoting on the center point, in which case distance doesn&#39;t matter because the angle of the line will stay the same, or it&#39;s pivoting from a ring point, so that it might hit another ring point first. But we&#39;ve already seen that it has to hit that center point eventually, so it will then proceed on to hit the extended point as well. So now we see that extending the distance of points out from the ring still allows for a solution.<br>All that remains is to show that for ANY set S, if you pick a point somewhere near the middle (doesn&#39;t have to be the exact center, just far enough in to avoid the possibility of moving only around the outside), then draw line segments from that point to each other point in S. Now you have drawn a starburst figure. Pick a distance less than or equal to the smallest of those segments and trim each segment to that length. Now you&#39;ve defined a ring that is functionally equivalent to S when some of the ring points are extended out. Since no three points can be collinear this will be possible for every set S and thus we have a solution possible for every possible S.", "comment_date": "2019-08-05T13:06:27Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Krithik Sankar", "comment_text": "Solve more interesting IMO problems !! loved the video!!", "comment_date": "2019-08-05T13:05:04Z", "likes_count": 113}, {"comment_by": "Omkar", "comment_text": "I wish i took part in IMO.

The actual math can be reduced to a simple algo to find the outer polygon and then any other point if you ray-cast outward in any direction you will intersect the locus line exactly once you.

A  big problem in both stem fields and pure math in my opinion is that the testing all to often relies on asking questions which purely test if someone has memorised accurately rules or information and not testing the ability to analyse problems and solve them from scratch.

Also I realized the middle thing because in the three point case I noticed that there were basically 2 ways that the line could rotate around, one where it always went between the other two points and one where it never did, I also then quickly noticed when I put a fourth point in between the three that only the scenario where the line was between the points would case it to reach every point an infinite number of times.<br><br>Perhaps if I didn\u2019t care about finishing the video before I slept, and if I actually got out a piece of paper to try it out on, I would\u2019ve been able to solve it myself.

Assuming there are finite points (which there have to be if none are colinear), then there will always be an arbitrary point P about which you can draw line L. Denote another line, M, which is set in place to be equal to line L at t=0. Then, for each point in S, there will be a unique angle \u03b8 between M and that point and the original pivot. Then, given that there are finite points, line L must pass through each angle \u03b8 in a full rotation. <br><br>Given arbitrary point N in S and arbitrary \u03b8 \u03a6, with original pivot P, current pivot P&#39;:<br>    Case 1: If L hits N while rotating (i.e. N is an element of L, ANG(L, M)=\u03a6, or PN=L), then the counter on N ticks up and the next point is denoted N. <br>    Case 2: If L is counterclockwise of N when ANG(L, M)=\u03a6, (i.e. line PN and L are parallel), then denote M&#39;=L. This process is recursive, but given that \u03a6 decreases each rotation (which it would have to given there are no colinear points), and this can occur infinitely many times, at some time t, N must be an element of L.<br><br><br>Then there must be a proof that L returns to the base case M. Not sure how to do that, but I&#39;d argue that something along the lines of Case 2 might work given that ANG(L,M) must be all possible values (0, 2pi] throughout the process.<br><br>Probably going to feel kinda dumb after finishing the video but will update with comments.<br><br><br>Edit: Well that was a simple solution, and I wasn&#39;t close.

Consider the n cases where the line is vertical through a point. Since the line will always eventually be vertical, any cycle must include one of these n cases, thus there can at most be n distinct cycles. In each of the cases the distribution of points on either side is different, but invariant throughout the cycle, thus the cases are from different cycles, (We&#39;ll separate left-right parities for simplicity), meaning there are at least n distinct cycles. Therefore we have exactly n distinct cycles identified by their left-right point distribution. Now consider that it is possible to draw a line through any point separating the n points into the same left-right distribution. All of these states must exist in the exact same cycle, since the distribution is the same. Therefore it forms a cycle where every point is visited, and since it&#39;s a cycle they will be visited infinitely often.", "comment_date": "2019-08-04T22:37:22Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Cem Kaya", "comment_text": "is there a solution which involves graph theory ?", "comment_date": "2019-08-04T22:35:32Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Gold Finch", "comment_text": "which tool is used to produce such animations ?", "comment_date": "2019-08-04T22:31:51Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Spiros Diochnos", "comment_text": "i think this video is one of the best in your channel<br>very well written", "comment_date": "2019-08-04T22:31:09Z", "likes_count": 2}, {"comment_by": "Erin Laura", "comment_text": "I watched and at the end I said out loud: &quot;Wow, that video was f***ing fun.&quot; The sounds and the smooth animations and the little light flash on each point as it becomes the new pivot are all great.

Since this is the first time I&#39;ve actually managed to solve something before seeing any part of the video, I just have to share how I found this out, I started off just picking a few points and just drawing a &quot;snapshot&quot; of the system at each pivot point. Then, I decided to record how the line splits the set in each snapshot, without caring to label each side. When recording the splits on the second snapshot, I saw that most of the points were still on the same side, with only one point which had been replaced. Then, I did it again except this time making the line into a sort of directional line(I called it a &quot;vector line&quot;) to record the points on the left and right sides of the line, mainly so I would have some definitive idea of which side the points are on. Then, I found that when going from one snapshot to the next one, one point was removed from a particular side(which is the point which the line pivots on in the next snapshot), and another point was added(which is the point which the line had pivoted on before). I didn&#39;t actually get much further than this, and decided to watch the rest of the video. When I got to the part where you asked what is the &quot;middle&quot;, and if one can guarantee that the line stays in that middle if it starts off there, I thought about it for a little bit, and made the definition of the middle be when a line divides the set in half(or at least divides it as good as possible). With that I found out that since the points on a particular side gain one point, and lose another point, then the number of points on each side must not change(ie. n + 1 - 1 = n). Therefore, when the line starts in the middle, it will remain in the middle<br><br><br>TL;DR, I discovered that the points on each side of the line are only replaced by another point when it changes its pivoting point. Then, during the video I used that discovery to figure out what definition of a &quot;line in the middle&quot; to use, and proved that the number of points on each side of a line remains constant as it switches pivot points. Thus proving that a line in the middle stays in the middle<br><br>Also,<br><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M64HUIJFTZM&amp;t=8m06s\">8:06</a>-<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M64HUIJFTZM&amp;t=8m09s\">8:09</a> I see what you did there with making the left and right sides blue and brown respectively", "comment_date": "2019-08-04T22:24:38Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Goryllo", "comment_text": "nice video, but 5Blue5Brown1White doesn&#39;t have the same ring, keep your name the way it is!", "comment_date": "2019-08-04T22:21:12Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Paul Paulson", "comment_text": "What if I start with 3 blue and 1 brown point?", "comment_date": "2019-08-04T22:21:11Z", "likes_count": 15}, {"comment_by": "Heberto Alarc\u00f3n Guill\u00e8n", "comment_text": "Quite brilliant.", "comment_date": "2019-08-04T22:21:10Z", "likes_count": 2}, {"comment_by": "Victor", "comment_text": "One of the most beautiful messages from your videos.<br>&lt;3", "comment_date": "2019-08-04T22:19:45Z", "likes_count": 11}, {"comment_by": "Eroraf86", "comment_text": "This video is the embodiment of &quot;obvious in retrospect&quot;.

We have the data to show that this specific group of people trained to think of mathematics in specific ways, for this specific type of test, did not think of the problem in these ways, and there might be a reason they didn&#39;t, despite the solution being, from an outside perspective, relatively intuitive. The ability to solve hard mathematical problems - in the certain mathematically inabstract ways that are trained into these students - doesn&#39;t mean that the question was necessarily difficult in an inherent way. To label every layperson who sees this problem and who visualizes the problem more simply and from a less mathematically strict perspective a &quot;fool&quot; is foolish. Many times over it&#39;s been demonstrated, across many fields, that outside perspectives are able to see problems and tackle them more easily, because a focused study can lead to preconceptions and uniform ways of thinking. Of course, maybe it IS a hard question. That&#39;s possible. But to think all people fools who might consider this an intuitive proof is kind of ironically a bit foolish to say. It could actually be a relatively easy problem. Because when I watched this, before even knowing the proof you&#39;d give, I thought about that problem of two points on earth with the same temperature and pressure, and how rotating means values swap sides in a very similar way to the proof you gave for this problem, and I came to the same conclusion about halves, with a slightly different way of approaching it, mentally, because I saw the fact that it involved rotation and swapping points for each other. So I dunno. I&#39;m not a mathematician, but having the ability, to, from an outside perspective, think of it in an abstract way and draw parallels to thematically similar concepts and simplify the ideas at play can make it an easy problem. What the test results might mean is that the way mathematics are taught and perceived create certain predefined ways of thinking about mathematical ideas. It could be a difficult problem, still. But the results don&#39;t mean that it&#39;s definitively a difficult problem. It means that the ones who took the test, mostly, didn&#39;t come up with ways of looking at it that provided insights into the premise&#39;s behaviour. Maybe I got really lucky and intuited an answer that was unlikely. But I think, probably, it might have more to do with the way math is thought about and taught. I think the data shows more about nature of formal mathematical conceptualization in academia than the problem itself. Because this problem could have been remade into other, mathematically equivalent problems, that might have been more or less difficult to the test takers. I could, obviously, be wrong, and it might simply be genuinely difficult. It might be. But it did seem intuitive to me before you&#39;d even given your proof, because of the fact it involved rotation, and I noticed something similar to other ideas I knew about. And I&#39;m a layperson. So. I dunno. Calling me a fool seems... not right. I think that if a person sees this and thinks it&#39;s intuitive, then it says more about the fact that what&#39;s supposedly intuitive wasn&#39;t intuitive to the more formally mathematically-minded, if that makes sense. The human mind is a very varied and complex thing. So teaching it mathematics in the ways that all these people were taught might create a generally uniform way of thinking about problems like this. Whereas any other person might be able to think of it in more and new, different ways.

G is infinite and describes every point of the plane. My goal now is to mark every point of G as a point of the plane, it doesnt matter if a point is marked more than once, in fact most of them will be marked more than once. To do this i use a line that rotates clockwise (the windmill). A point of G is marked as part of the plane, if the line hits it. In the simplest case with one center of rotation you just have to rotate 360\u00b0 to mark the whole plane. In general you can say that the line needs to rotate at least 360\u00b0 to mark the whole plane. <br><br><br><br>Now i imagine every point of S as the center of its own rotating line. This gives every point of S its own &quot;colored circle of rotation&quot;. In addition to that, all of those circles overlap perfectly, every point of one circle is also a point of every other circle. Thus it should be possible to mark the whole plane via the sum of part-rotations of the single rotation circles of the points of S. So if every point of G is marked, every point of S is also marked, because S is part of G. And because that sum adds up to the whole plane, there is no fear of getting into a loop after a while, where some points are spared, because then you would no longer mark the whole plane, which you did at first, leading to a contradiction.<br><br><br>Im sure this is pretty convoluted, but its very hard to explain my thoughts given that im neither native, nor do i have a maths background.

But basically the way I see it is this, if you position the line on a point such that it bisects any two other points it will be &quot;captive&quot; in the consistent rotation. Always leaving one point and being between the original and the next. As it arrives at the next point it will leave the pivot and be between said point and another point(at the minimum, the previous pivot).

If you graph the &quot;height&quot; of each point as a function of the angle, it gives a sine curve with an amplitude and phase determined by its position. The height of the arm is always equal to the height of one of the points, but it will switch whenever another point&#39;s height is equal to it. So you can represent the height of the arm by tracing along the sine curves, switching from one curve to another every time the new one crosses your path.<br><br>For me at least it was a lot easier to visualize finding a zigzag path between these sine curves than it was to reason about the original geometric formulation.", "comment_date": "2019-08-04T20:36:19Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Tetraedri_", "comment_text": "This was a very enjoyable puzzle! I came up with a slightly different reasoning, which also gives a stronger result (explained below). However, the thumbnail spoiled a major part of the solution - without the thumbnail, I would&#39;ve probably needed to experiment more with the problem before finding the invariant. Just something to be considered in the future when designing thumbnails ;).<br><br>So, what I did was the following. Denote n to be the number of points in S. For a line passing through a single pivot point in S, denote L and R to be the number of points on the left and right, respectively. First, I did the following observations (same as in the video, just slightly generalized):<br>1. During a windmill, L-R is invariant.<br>2. For any pivot in S there exists a line such that<br>   a) if n is odd, L-R = 0<br>   b) if n is even, L-R = 1<br>3. If we fix the angle of the line, L-R gives a different value for every pivot.<br><br>This is where my reasoning diverges. Let b = 0, if n is odd, and b = 1, if n is even. Start at any pivot with a line such that L-R=b. By 2, for any pivot there exists some angle for which L-R=b. By 3, for any angle, if there exists a point in S which gives L-R=b, such a point is unique. Therefore, for any pivot in S, when the line is at an angle such that L-R=b for that pivot, we know that the line must have that point as a pivot. As each angle is visited infinitely many times during a windmill, the claim is proved.<br><br>This solution actually also tells, how many times a point in S is a pivot during a single round of windmill when we fix L-R=d. For a fixed pivot, we say that two lines are equivalent if they share they share the sets of points on the left and the right side of them. Combining observations 1, 2 and 3, it&#39;s not too difficult to prove that during single round of windmill, this point is a pivot the same number of times as there are different lines (up to equivalence) which give the value L-R=d.", "comment_date": "2019-08-04T20:35:48Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Petterson de Lima", "comment_text": "Have I really just cried over a mathematical problem?", "comment_date": "2019-08-04T20:35:27Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Y N", "comment_text": "Matem\u00e1tica \u00e9 impressionante.", "comment_date": "2019-08-04T20:34:33Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Lucas S.", "comment_text": "SHUT UP AND TEACH ME MATH", "comment_date": "2019-08-04T20:33:46Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Y N", "comment_text": "......", "comment_date": "2019-08-04T20:33:03Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "M.

Define the line to be &quot;inside&quot; the triangle if it EVER passes through the interior of the triangle (not just the boundary).  <br><br><br>Observe that as the line rotates, if it is inside a triangle, it will always be inside that triangle.  This can be seen in the following way.  If the line is rotating about a point that is not a vertex of the triangle, then in order to pass through the interior of the triangle, the line must pass between two vertices of the triangle.  Rotating such a line a small amount about any point a sufficiently small amount doesn&#39;t cause it to jump over a vertex.  If the line is rotating about a vertex of the triangle, and is inside the triangle, then it must pass through the other two vertices.  A small rotation of the line does not change this.  Finally, observe that if the line is rotating about a vertex of the triangle, and contacts another vertex, then the rotation of the line about the new vertex will immediately swing the line into the interior of the triangle.  (This last bit takes a little thought, but is not hard to see).  <br><br><br>Similarly, if the triangle is &quot;outside&quot; a triangle, it will never become inside that triangle, through similar observations.  <br><br><br>If a line is inside a triangle, it will pivot around all three vertices of that triangle at least once in a half turn.  <br><br><br>The line will pivot around a point if it passes through a triangle that contains that point as a vertex.  <br><br><br>To make the line pass through all points, you find a set of triangles that have every point as a vertex, that have a common internal point.  If the line passes through this common point, it will rotate about every vertex.  <br><br><br>To see that there is such a collection of triangles with a common internal point, find the smallest circle that contains every point in your set.  To be smallest, there must be a point on the circumference, pick one and call it x.  Draw a line through x and tangent to the circle.  Pivot that line about x (clockwise or counterclockwise, it doesn&#39;t matter) until it first intersects another point in the set, and call that point y.  For all other points in your set, z, z not equal to x and y, draw a triangle xyz.  All of these triangles have a common edge, x-y, and therefore intersecting all of them will give you an interior point near edge x-y (finite intersections of open sets are open).  <br><br><br>Choosing any point as your initial pivot, and orienting the line to pass through this common intersection point will cause the line to pivot through all points at least once.  <br><br><br><br><br>Finally, as an aside, if you imagine that you are performing this process on a sphere, then you can imagine that each set of three points determines multiple triangles (some of which pass through infinity).

I haven&#39;t watched the video yet, that&#39;s just my guess as to why it can keep going forever in the middle.", "comment_date": "2019-08-04T17:22:57Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "GAbitbol", "comment_text": "Huge video !!!", "comment_date": "2019-08-04T17:22:51Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Shrey Rupani", "comment_text": "Such a beautiful video..", "comment_date": "2019-08-04T17:22:10Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "PRZYBYL", "comment_text": "sir would you make chaos theory effects videos series ... thanks ur explanation is beautiful as always", "comment_date": "2019-08-04T17:21:20Z", "likes_count": 16}, {"comment_by": "gonecoastal4", "comment_text": "The answer is ..................<br> <br><br><br>Three?", "comment_date": "2019-08-04T17:21:15Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Maxx Byron", "comment_text": "For your 2M subscriber special, can we see you tackle an IMO problem you\u2019ve never seen before, to see how your brain works without having a ton of time to animate and think?
