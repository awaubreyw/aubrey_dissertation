I always like math from my childhood (may be I was good at visual reasoning) but as I was introduced to more advanced maths I couldn&#39;t link between the rigor of mathematical equations and it&#39;s visual intuitions. At that point I even doubted the very existence a visual intuition (or any kind of intuition)  behind those equations  and formulae I was introduced to( if you know how the Indian education system works before college you would understand my situation). My every  teacher acted as if the Intuition was obvious in those equations and I couldn&#39;t see it and kept on making me understand what those equations were saying on the surface level and they never  talked about the deeper interconnectivity. But still I struggled to find Intuitions even after I doubted it&#39;s existence. And then oneday I stumbled upon one of your videos which gave a intuition to Euler&#39;s Identity ... And man I cried that day....finally I got the validation that my search for Intuition in higher mathematics is not as useless and idiotic ( I cannot get the right word for it) as I was led to believe. Thank you Mr. Anderson, you did a lot more than you know for people like us. Your video helped me a lot but the validation to pursue a intuitive approach ( you guys may think it&#39;s too obvious, but trust me, environment influences your believes even in core science subjects and you need validation, atleast I did) was what changed my life. I am truly indept .

My father was meek and tidy. This was a no brainer for me. Without knowing the  math. The numbers are skewed much differently in my home county. 5 towns with schools. 3 towns with a public library and a library in each school for a total of 8. Population was 7500. Not all were farmers of course, children and women participated in farming but, 99.9 % of farmers were men. I am guessing here sort of: this brings the total number of farmers to approximately 2000.  8 librarians to 2000 farmers equals .004% librarians to farmers. Meek and tidy is another aspect altogether. More messy farmers than tidy farmers is the truth. Exactly how many were tidy is a level of measurement standard which needs to be defined. Some of us call an organized mess tidy. If you can find what you need for a task within 5 minutes you are very tidy. If you give up and go to town to purchase that object you are un-tidy and likely poor.  The comparison of a librarian to a farmer isn&#39;t really fair. The librarian is a one trick pony who deals only with  books in a confined space. A farmer on the other hand has to have skills that are hard to count due to the level of knowing needed to be a farmer. Animal science, soil science, fertilizer, seed germination and planting populations, mechanical understanding and maintenance, lubrication, fuels, engine and motors, grain storage, building maintenance, land conservation, farm programs, marketing of all commodity&#39;s, planning/projections, upgrades and integration of new methods. Finally knowing which way the political wind blows by being active in state and local organizations is fairly essential due to the power of the group information data base. It is safe to say that a farmer has the most variables which must be coordinated in each season while dealing with the randomness of weather, insects, invasive animals, weeds, etc. and political based programs than any other Business owner operator. Since the death of the Democratic Farmer Labor party we have discovered the democrat/socialist/communist party to be an ineffective partner. Republicans try hard but, the representation isn&#39;t as good as for instance The Republican Farmer Labor party would be. That would actually be a nonsensical term.  For a capitalist society to be successful the farmers must remain poor.  The only producer of commodities on the earth who do not set prices for their production is the Farmers. These markets are government run by gambling operations. They bet on futures and losses and even trade commodities at less than half the value to other countries.

The question exists in a vacuum with no context of location, ratio of types of round objects in said location, time of year, where the object fell from, etc. If I were to say, &quot;You are in Indonesia, the country with the highest export of coconuts in the world, and standing on a beach next to a coconut tree during harvest season.&quot; and then ask the original question, then obviously the likely answer is coconut. The answer given is based on personal bias and given information, it doesn&#39;t mean that answering &#39;orange&#39; to the first question is wrong, it just means that the asker didn&#39;t give enough information to start with. <br><br>In the example in the video, Steve is a theoretical person. Does Steve live in America, like we are apparently supposed to deduce? Or does he live in the theoretical land of Libraria where there are no farmers and 1 in every 3 people are librarians? Given that the &quot;Evidence&quot; doesn&#39;t tell us the locations of this theoretical person, both ideas are just as likely and therefore cannot factor in to the answer we give, and so the answer must be delivered based solely on the preconceived notions of how we think a librarian or a farmer would act, regardless of what the ratio of workers in each field are, and therefore, it would boil down to your 40% vs. 10% number that you used, which means he is 80% likely to be a librarian.<br><br>I do not dispute that the math works for real life situations, and honestly, it is quite ingenious. But the fact remains that the question of Steve&#39;s job is designed to make the person answering the question feel stupid when you pull the rug out from under them and tell them &quot;well no, the ratio of farmers to librarians in America is such that he is far more likely to be a farmer.

We don&#39;t think about how many carts it took, or how long it took to scan it all, or whether or not the store would let them buy that much, or how they got that many bottles of OJ into a 1997 Toyota Corolla, because the question doesn&#39;t ask us that, and it is not required of us to answer those questions in order to answer the question being asked of us.<br><br>tl;dr: I don&#39;t like the question about Steve&#39;s job cause the actual answer is pretentious and based on information we aren&#39;t given.

Should we consider the ratio of farmers to librarians for the whole world or just in the country where the question is being asked? If it is being asked in the tiny nation of Monaco then there are probably more librarians than farmers! Steve is a man&#39;s name, if not universally then at least overwhelmingly enough as a to make negligible difference, so should we be considering the ratio of male farmers to male librarians? Steve is an English name, so should we be considering only the populations of English speaking countries?

Needs to use real data on Corona test accuracy, therefore accuracy of infections, the consequence of how many people really die of it, inluding the probability of hidden infections and thus immunity (as studied by Ioannidis) and the plausibility (propability of benefits) of vaccinating a huge number of people that are not at risk such as children and anyone below the age of 50. I built a model and calculated it and it is possibly wrong but if not what we are doing is political madness. I have not yet included the potential risks of the vaccines itself as the numbers of this are most likely highly inaccurate at this time. The politicians and modellers use for their calculations ZERO existing immunity (no or mild infections) and full transmissability of all infected AND potentially infected asymptomatics. Recents studies disprove both and that should be mapped into a Bayes model of the effects of a large scale vaccination of people with no risk of symptoms. HOW ABOUT IT?

This view is borne out by the Linda question--the authors themselves show that all you have to do is phrase it in a way that makes this clear and most people give the right answer.  I saw an article in the NYT years ago that cited a study showing that 15 percent of people admitted to occasionally driving as much as 5 mph over the speed limit, and 5% admitted to going as much as 15 mph over. Incredibly, the study was about traffic behavior and not about the fact that between 85% and 90% of respondents gave a manifestly false answer.  I just drove 60 miles on the Garden State Parkway and passed exactly 0 vehicles despite going just under 80. I was literally the only person on the road who was within 15 miles of the speed limit.

Alternatively, I think if you asked &quot;given group A and group B, and a description of a randomly chosen person&#39;s personality, which group are they more likely to be in?&quot; people would be more likely to correctly understand the question. The example of Linda is a super obvious example of how vague linguistics are confusing people more than human intuition being the problem, reading the blurb, the question seems to be &quot;what are the odds that Linda is a bank teller who is NOT an activist, vs. her being a bank teller AND an activist&quot;. The nonspecific wording, and I think this conclusion is borne out by the fact that people understand the question perfectly in its numerical form, is actually what makes people&#39;s response seem illogical. In both examples, the question is not a natural and normal way to interpret the words that are presented, so yes, human intuition is wrong, but mostly because the person asking the question did so in a poor way.

Moral of the story: do not major in philosophy.  Of course someone could argue, that the only reason she took a job which only requires a GED is because she needs her free time to be an activist in the feminist community.  I am still willing to bet there is a higher chance that she just goes home after work everyday and watches TV.  Most people who were active protesters in college, do not continue once they get stuck in the routine of going to work and going home everyday.   She has a higher chance of NOT being an activist then being one. In order for there to be a higher chance for her to be an activist then there must be a higher percentage of people who protest in college and continue then people who protest in college and then stop.  Calling out people on pure laziness and selfishness, I can assure you, there are more people who stop protesting once they have responsibilities.

But I am too lazy to go the extra mile and actually gather data to update my view. But I am willing to do so, if somebody shows me a paper, something serious which I can assign a high probality to be true. Applying Bayes theorem is easy for things one can check out simply by logical reasoning with general knowledge about the world. But when you need hard facts as well as their context, things get blurry and fuzzy. Therefore I conclude that there is an inherent\u00a0limit to assigning probability to many real-world sitautions. And our brains fail exactly here. They fail to recognize their own limitations and lead us to wrong conclusions. Noone is immune to this. Even the smartest people out there, who teach others, are prone to fallacies. And Bayes theorem is a very powerful tool to show this. From what I observed, people are usually &quot;stuck&quot; with what they learn about the world when they finish their education. But the world changes. Much faster than people notice. And it changes for the better, not for worse. I do not want to get into biology here, but I can imagine why this might have been evolutionary beneficial.

Some arguments:\r<br>- &quot;Very little interest in ... the world of reality&quot; - farmers are knee deep into cow shit, you can hardly get more into reality than that (&quot;but that doesn&#39;t necessarily mean they have an interest in it&quot; - costly actions signaling).\r<br>- An assumption might be that librarians are around people way more often than farmers; in which case, we would more readily apply labels such as &quot;shy&quot;, &quot;meek&quot;, etc to them; whereas for farmers, absence of evidence (lack of humans around to attest it) is not evidence of absence - in other words, we&#39;re probably intuitively less sure of their shyness and meekness (so this is already an apriori information / context (&quot;familiarity&quot;) problem). These points apply to a &quot;librarian vs farmer&quot; comparison.\r<br>\r<br>Now, to unpack the context in which the comparison is made.\r<br>All considered groups:\r<br>- The general populace (population or sample - the &quot;outside&quot;/denominator)\r<br>- % of (population or sample) that are librarians\r<br>- % of (population or sample) that are farmers\r<br>\r<br>This defines the options for Steve as:\r<br>1. Steve is a librarian AND NOT a farmer. (1, 0)\r<br>2. Steve is a farmer AND NOT a librarian. (0, 1)\r<br>3. Steve is a librarian AND a farmer. (1, 1)\r<br>4. Steve is NEITHER a librarian NOR a farmer (&quot;null&quot;). (0, 0)\r<br>\r<br>To me, the question sounds like: &quot;Given Steve, which one is he more likely to be?&quot;. This would limit the &quot;population&quot; to Steve and present a binary choice of 1 OR 2, of which 1 fits the description more closely.\r<br>In contrast, the Bayesian solution includes the other options (or at least the 4th one, in this case). It seems to answer a different question - akin to: &quot;Which of the two options (groups) has a higher prevalence in the population&quot; (1 / (1 + 2 + 3 + 4)) vs (2 / (1 + 2 + 3 + 4))\r<br>\r<br>\rSo possible answers to the (very good) question of &quot;whether people even think to consider that ratio&quot; might be: &quot;they do not consider it based on the given (assumed) context&quot; (null), or &quot;they exclude it based on the given (assumed) context&quot; (1 -&gt; 0). Changing the phrasing seems to shift the results to the &quot;expected&quot; ones. This might indicate that people make different choices based on perceived LACK of information; they &quot;add in&quot; context differently based on how much is missing. It is possible that this process is non-linear, so that having 50% of the context (and assuming the rest) leads to an entirely different answer than having 75% of the context; different methods of evaluations (e.g. heuristic vs formal logic) might be involved in the way gaps are filled in at different &quot;stages&quot;.", "comment_date": "2019-12-27T01:11:43Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "ed simnett", "comment_text": "re first example- I live in a city...", "comment_date": "2019-12-27T00:58:58Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Istvan Kertesz", "comment_text": "This is still hazy, what you call evidence is not really evidence but an observation, it doesn&#39;t prove that Steve is a librarian or a farmer alone.", "comment_date": "2019-12-27T00:27:03Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Billy Kotsos", "comment_text": "The prior will always be a tricky thing to decide.", "comment_date": "2019-12-26T22:27:39Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Anto Graph", "comment_text": "I was littraly reading this part of thinking fast and slow this morning :)<br>Very nice video animations really helps understand the idea better", "comment_date": "2019-12-26T20:55:52Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "AstroTibs", "comment_text": "Steve and Linda sound like a blast at parties", "comment_date": "2019-12-26T20:47:29Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "John L.", "comment_text": "Keep this up and I might learn something...", "comment_date": "2019-12-26T20:16:54Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "thatguy", "comment_text": "yea", "comment_date": "2019-12-26T19:48:30Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "That Scar", "comment_text": "I look at Steve and I instantly know what you are going to talk about because I have been introduced to a similar story by a friend.<br>But holy crap, the stylized portrait is basically an exact match for my friend and I would be roughly 99% certain that it&#39;s him initially :D", "comment_date": "2019-12-26T18:24:34Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Sandpiper B F", "comment_text": "Why is the channel called 3 blue 1 brown", "comment_date": "2019-12-26T18:18:19Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "grovermatic", "comment_text": "dude...", "comment_date": "2019-12-26T18:14:30Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "John Hammer", "comment_text": "<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HZGCoVF3YvM&amp;t=3m25s\">3:25</a> why is P(Librarian given description) is 4 / (4 +20).

Simply, in the first instance, they are answering a different question. True, they are simply asked which occupation is it more likely Steve will be found in, but, in a more or less free society, without any particular impediment to the adoption of either profession, people are assuming that  Steve will have developed a preference for the occupation, of the two, the stereotype of which best fits the evidence constituted by the qualitative report on Steve&#39;s psychological profile, and then followed through on that preference and realised his choice. Rather than a failure to consider evidence relevant to a question the experimenters interpreted as simply one about probability, the subjects took the question to be a normal (and not disingenuous) use of ordinary language - the most rational course - and so one that included the normal context in which one would normally think about the life and life choices of another. In short, Kahneman and Tvarsky smuggled an unnatural use of language into an ordinary and natural conversation. Unsurprisingly, the answers deviated from what appears to be rational if one quite unnaturally imagines the question was actually just about probability.<br><br><br>The same problem, in different form, is illustrated in the case of Linda. In an ordinary and natural use of language, the framing of the choices- &quot;bank teller&quot;, or &quot;bank teller active in feminism&quot;, whatever their strict logical content - and therefore their necessary relation of set and subset - actually suggests, in a conversational context, the choices &quot;bankteller not active in feminism&quot; and &quot;bank teller active in feminism&quot;. This, quiter obviously, is the most likely explanation for the alleged lapse from rationality here.<br><br><br>This all being said, the examples still works effectively to introduce and motivate an understasnding of Bayes&#39; Theorem, which this video explains extremely well :). The problem is not for Bayes nor probability calculus, but for the psychology of judgement formation. The experiment quite literally proves nothing whatsoever about our normal &#39;folk&#39; capacity for an appropriate factoring in of  probabilistic evidence into our processes of judgement formation. It may be that we, as an organism, or as an organism in a culture, have problems in this regard, but these simple experiments quite literallty illustrate or establish nothing along those lines whatsoever.<br><br><br>By the way, the awarding of the Nobel (Memorial) Prize in Economics to Kahneman for the work both he and Tversky did in the sphere of the non-rational cues to the formation of beliefs and judgements is, rather than an assimilation of this part of Psycholgy to Economics (lending itself to a commercially motivated rebranding as socalled &#39;freakonomics&#39;), rather, a recognition that Economics simply grinds to an inevitalbe halt at the spurious notions of rational agents and optimisers and that Economists and all of us are beholden to Psychologists, but not only Psychologists, but also to all those whose work bears upon non-rational influence, from gastro-enterologists to hairdressers, an including poets, drunkards, mediocre politicians, those who ice cakes, and, god help us, journalists.

Let&#39;s assume, the illness is so rare, that only 1 in a million will ever develop it. So, my prior that I have it is 1/1000000. Now, I go to a clinic and run the test, which is super accurate (99.9%). Suppose, I receive positive result.

It&#39;s presented as a question of whether a bank teller who is 31 years old, single, outspoken, very bright, majored in philosophy, was deeply concerned with issues of discrimination, and social justice, and also participates in anti-nuclear demonstrations is more likely to fall under the category of bank tellers who are active in the feminist movement versus how many bank tellers that fit that description are specifically not.

But i do not know whether this is right or wrong.I am very eagar to know whether this is right or <a href=\"http://wrong.so/\">wrong.So</a>,please someone inform me in the reply.And if it is not true then why?Here&#39;s the generalization,fermat&#39;s last theorem is x^n+y^n=z^n where x,y,z is any whole number. We can write it as x^n(1+(y/x)^n)=z^n. Now it is an easy and an already proved fact that   ..................  x^n(1+(y/x)^n)\u2260z^n if (1+(y/x)^n) is  not a nth power of any rational number. Now, It seems useful to look at the (y/x) term. There are three cases to consider,.... ... ..... .the first  case is if (y/x) is a whole number.  If.... ..  y/x is a whole number then it is very easy to show that................ (1+(y/x)^n)\u2260p^n(where p is a rational number) by showing that the powers of fractions could not be a natural number. (I have a proof of this although i am not sure about its rightness or wrongness)  ...... ................................  The second case : the second case is where (y/x) is a non recurring decimal (like.56,.6789 etc.) we can always write these kinds of decimal making the denominator numbers like 10,100 etc.i.e. any number whose first digit is 1 and the rest of the digits are 0.from now on we call these changed denominator <a href=\"http://a.now/\">a.Now</a>, if we multiply the..... (1+(y/x)^n) by a^n then the equation becomes .....   (a^n+y^n where a could be any number whose first digit is 1 and rest of the digits are 0).Now if we can prove that a^n+y^n\u2260z^n (where  p is any natural number) then fermat&#39;s theorem is proved whenever (y/x) is a non recurring decimal.. ............................................   The third case is when (y/x) is a recurring decimal.( like 4/3,8/5 etc.). We can always write these kinds of fractions making the denominator a number whose all of the digits are 9 or the first few digits are 9 and rest of the digits are 0(for example, we can write 4/3 as 12/9 and also write 7/12 as 525/900 etc.)from now on, we call these numbers b.  Now, if we mutiply (1+(y/x)^n) by its changed denominator b, the equation becomes (b^n+y^n). Now,if we can prove that b^n+y^n\u2260z^n then fermat&#39;s theorem will be valid when (y/x) is a recurring decimal.. Moral of the story is if we can prove that x^n+y^n\u2260z^n when x is any number whose first digit is 1 and rest of digits are zero or whose all of the digits are 9  then it is proved for all the numbers. Note that if his theorem is valid for 99 then it is valid for 990,99000 and so on....................................................

They also tested it on grad students who had taken probability and stats courses and would be familiar with how to compute the probabilities of all of these statements -- and they still saw people ranking the less likely statement higher in probability.)<br><br><br>This study has been repeated in various situations over the years.  It&#39;s a very well-documented result, known as the &quot;conjunctive fallacy&quot; or similar to the idea of &quot;misleading vividness.&quot;  To see how it plays out in potentially nefarious ways, consider that it&#39;s a common strategy used by trial lawyers.  Replace &quot;bank teller&quot; (the less probable thing) with &quot;murderer.&quot;  Lawyers frequently tell a detailed story that incorporates facts that seem likely about a defendant, thereby making it easier for a jury to believe that the defendant is ALSO a murderer -- because everything else checks out with what they know about the person.  Similarly, the description here makes people think it&#39;s likely that &quot;Linda is a feminist&quot; and they will rank statements including that supposition higher, regardless of whether you tack on irrelevant and significantly less probable details.", "comment_date": "2019-12-23T09:11:55Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Tyler Matthew Harris", "comment_text": "Wow.
