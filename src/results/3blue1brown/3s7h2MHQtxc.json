Not knowing about the hilbert curve, I developed a curve that, while discontinuous, does map like events in musical space to like events in physical space, in a way that maybe only has the advantage of being easier to intuit for a human, because it doesn&#39;t require rotation of the curve from one order to the next.  At any scale, the traversal is upper left, upper right, lower left, lower right.  There is a discontinuity in the middle of each set of 4, but since humans are used to musical patterns of powers of two, it&#39;s a pretty intuitive mapping.  And if you thread the discontinuity through the &#39;in between&#39; space, you get a properly continuous curve that visually divides space into 4 at every scale.   And although it only maps to positive points, you don&#39;t need to resort to the &#39;cheat&#39; of spiraling in order to keep filling positive space.  I used it to create a kind of music paper that I used for many years, and made it very easy to keep track of where you were in the music.  It obviously works better for music that is more binary (or quaternary) such as folk or pop, and less well for more through-composed music.

There isn&#39;t really anything that says that real numbers should be used in modelling the continuity of a line or curve, especially since we now have a theory of infinitesimals in function. Cantor didn&#39;t believe in infinitesimals, and calculus strictly avoided their existence for a long time, but since Abraham Robinson proved they could be manipulated in a rigorous way, these numbers are indeed legit. This means that a more detailed model than the real numbers of the continuum is possible, one that deals with more precise points squeezed in between the rational points at new places. With a sufficiently strong microscope we can see these infinitesimals spread out around all the rational points infinitelly more numerous than the irrational numbers there, since points are considered as representing the same irrational number if there is only an infinitesimal length between them.<br><br>But there is still room for improvements. Since infinitesimal sizes exist in the continuum, we can also find infinitesimals to the infinitesimal size, infinitely smaller than the infinitesimal &quot;1/\u03c9&quot; units, where \u03c9 = an infinite unit of size Aleph-null. And infinitesimals to the smaller infinitesimal units, and so on...  Which tells us that the reciprocal of Cantor&#39;s infinities are as real as the real numbers, and should be regarded as such, especially if we try to map all the zero size points on a line segment, and using different numbers for points lying on different position, no matter how close.<br><br>I realize now I should also add an example, to enlighten the need for infinitesimals in the modelling of the continuum. Consider the Cantor set (a line segment that has its length reduced by a third in each of an infinite number of steps). The resulting length of what is left will be zero, using the standard methods of infinite series. Using instead &quot;resulting length = starting length x (2/3)^H&quot; where H is an infinite number, the result instead becomes an infinitesimal length bigger than zero. The infinitesimal length of the result depends on the infinite number H used, the bigger H the smaller the infinitesimal leftover becomes. Thanks to the standard methods disregard of infinitesimals we normally don&#39;t need to worry about them  (they can often simply be ignored), but sometimes they play a main role, especially in exact calculations, or at least they should do.<br><br>Another example would be to introduce more precision in other infinite series calculations with the help of hyperreals. The series 1 + 1/2 + 1/4 + ... that has a real number sum of 2 then becomes the hyperreal 2 - 2 x (1/2)^\u03c9, where \u03c9 is the infinite number of all positive integers. This hyperreal number is infinitesimally close to 2. Also divergent series are possible to calculate using hyperreals since they include infinite values, the diverging infinite series 1 + 3 + 5 + ... = \u03c9^2. So, with more precision comes a better insight of standard math objects. The infinitely big and the infinitesimally small shouldn&#39;t be ignored like they used to be in the not so ancient math history.

If you think about this carefully, you will discover that for such a curve to be constructed, it must imply that the perpendicular distance between any to parallel line segments on the curve must be zero. Otherwise there will be points between such parallel line segments not touch by the curve. Now if the perpendicular distance between parallel line segments is zero, it must follows that all line segments parallel to say the x-axis converge to one single line parallel to the x-axis. We therefore have an infinity of points above and below such a line. The same holds for the Y-axis. The conclusion is that we end up with an infinity of points that don&#39;t lie on any portion of the curve.

If all wavelengths were put together we would get a single continuous wavelength that is distinct in sound to any other wavelength corresponding to a different image. We can increase the accuracy of the transcribed wavelength by increasing the total number of pixels AKA increasing the image&#39;s resolution. But if we only associate sound to a defined pixel it would be practically impossible for our brains to comprehend the sound of the image to effectively interpret the image without seeing it. Our brains can not intuitively interpret sight from sound. The image would give us a noise and we would have to elaborate on what that sound is corresponding to whether it is a elephant or perhaps a scenic image of a park in Japan. And no, hearing the wavelength of a respective pixel in a image is not the same as hearing a car driving by and stating affirmatively that is a car, because we can intuitively interpret the sound of the car to a image that directly corresponds with it not a bundle of pixels associated with the car.", "comment_date": "2019-07-17T17:48:33Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Willy", "comment_text": "One practical use for pseudo hilbert curves can be found in video game physics simulations, where one of the biggest problems is to find a fast method to bundle up objects of the game that are close to each other.

With a snake curve for example, every given point has a position and a direction (well one can give it a direction). If you are on the bottom left corner, no matter the resolution of the snake curve, you will always head to the right. A Hilbert curve does not have that. For a pseudo-Hilbert curve of order 1, if  the &quot;direction&quot; of a point in the bottom left corner is to the right, then for a curve of order 2, the direction would be up, 3 right, 4 up, and the limit would not exist, the same way you cannot define the limit of 1010101010101010 etc. If one were to apply something like a derivative test to a Hilbert curve it seems to me that the line from f(a) to f(a+h), as h goes to 0, would be something like an infinite spiral, the slope of that line would never converge to a constant value. In other words, it would be physically impossible to draw a &quot;tangent&quot; line.

Both CPU&#39;s and GPU&#39;s use caches to speed up calculations, because it is expected that if I request data at some location, I will most likely request data close to that location in the near future. Basically, when you ask for a few bytes, they store an entire section of the memory in anticipation that you will use it. Memory is of course just a long line of bytes. Textures, whether they are 2D or 3D, are slightly different. If I request a color from a texture at some 2D or 3D point, the same logic would mean that I would want to store an entire 2D or 3D chunk around that point in anticipation of the future. So in order to reuse the same caching mechanism that already works for 1D arrays, they use a curve, in this case, the Morton&#39;s Curve or Z-Curve. It is not as mathematically optimal as a Hilbert curve in terms of keeping nearby 2D points nearby in 1D, but it is extremely simple to compute from the 2D coordinate by just turning X and Y into binary, interleaving their bits, and then converting back into a single decimal location.

Every single point between 0 and 4 in 1D continuous space should be accounted for, right? Well, wrong! because pi is there somewhere, and so is e, and phi, and the square root of 2, etc. Even though you have infinity divided 1 dimensional continuous space into 0 dimensional points, you still haven&#39;t accounted for all the space/points that actually exist in that region. This is proven as per Cantor&#39;s order of infinities. Similarly, with space filling curves, it&#39;s basically the same thing going on, except just with one extra dimension (and I&#39;m pretty sure you can repeat the pattern for higher dimensional space). So for example with the Hilbert curve, the line is a fractal based on a tessellating square pattern, so it is dividing 2 dimensional continuous space into infinite lines following a pattern of right angles. Can such a pattern, taken to the limit of infinity, fully account for every single point that appears on the curve of a circle? or a natural logarithmic spiral? Or\u00a0curves which cannot be defined by\u00a0a polynomial series?\u00a0I don&#39;t think so. Therefore, the Hilbert curve doesn&#39;t actually account for the complete infinity of continuous 2 dimensional space, it only accounts for those points which can be defined rationally, it cannot account for any irrational points within that space, because the very nature of its propagation through space is rational, and therefore even though you can take its limit to infinity it still will never be able to account for irrational points in the curvature of space, as would be found on the circumference of a perfect circle appearing within the infinite Hilbert curve.

It confines all previous points to a 1/4th area and all but one points (0,0) will be out of place. This method basically adds more points to the ends of the curve.<br><br>2) For point preservation you need to extend the hilbert curve equally at every point. This means that you can only have point preservation if you extend it by 2 times on each side. You can&#39;t use hilbert curves to extend the resolution by an arbitrary amount while preserving positions. It has to be 2^2 and the extention has to be applied the same to every point on the curve to give this property.<br>So the new bits of curve must replace every point in the curve at that particular place and not simply extend the ends. This is what guarantees the points position to not change.<br><br>3) Now to the snake situation. If you replace every bit of the snake by a longer bit of snake (like is needed in the hilbert curve case) and you apply the same restriction of having to upp the length by 4 (2 on each side in the 2D view) then this will ALSO preserve position.<br><br>So this whole explanation of hilbert curve and snake curve is contrived and doesn&#39;t make any sense.<br><br>There may be other properties of the hilbert curve that makes it interesting, but what is shown in the video is not it.", "comment_date": "2018-03-02T12:39:59Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Wafflethorpe", "comment_text": "Infinite math, and the connection between the infinite and the finite is super interesting to me.

If you start your Hilbert&#39;s curving with the three legs being one meter in length it will take an infinite number of itterations to become a &quot;space-filling&quot; curve, but will only take 116 itterations for the legs to become smaller than the planck length. So, although the theoretical or mathematical Hilbert&#39;s curve may involve an infinite series, and infinitley thin lines, the potential for it to be used in physics may be much more attainable than is evident from its mathematic properties.
