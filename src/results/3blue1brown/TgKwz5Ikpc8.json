A vector, the composition of scalars, then carries with it the assumption that those scalars have a quantifiable relation, including the identity for R1, etc.<br><br>If you treat linear algebra like truth tables in deductive logic, the whole endeavor becomes way more interesting imo", "comment_date": "2022-08-19T14:39:57Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Samuel Uziel", "comment_text": "This is a amazing video!!!!! \ud83d\udc4d\ud83d\udc4d\ud83d\udc4d", "comment_date": "2022-08-18T02:39:31Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Harry Taylor", "comment_text": "The odd thing about polynomials as vectors is that they&#39;re no longer just one thing.

If we start making an analogy, we write our vector v as v = Ux, where U is a matrix of basis vectors, and x tells the combination of the basis. So, in the same way, when we have defined basis functions, shouldn&#39;t we write polynomial p as p = Ba, <br>B = [b0 b1 ......bn......upto infinity] <br>and every basis function, <br>bn(x) = [-infinity ...........x^n......infinity].T         and                     a is [a0 a1.........an....a(infinity)]<br><br>So when we take a derivative of p= Ba, using matrix D, it should be Dp or DBa. This is what we do in the linear transformation of vectors. So it essentially should be the application of composite matrix (DB) on infinite constant vector a. <br>or Dp = DBa<br>In linear transformation, we are effectively moving our basis vectors, but the offset matrix here will not change matrix B. In fact, it does not act on B, but on a.  Here, our offset matrix is applied on a, and therefore, <br>Dp = BDa<br><br>Here, we are not changing our basis vectors B. We are keeping them intact and manipulating constant vector first. This really make me spin around, but finally, I came to conclusion that both are possible. <br><br>If we go p = DBa approach, our <b>derivative matrix D</b> will simply be difference matrix not offset matrix. It will do numerical differentiation of every column of b and transform say x^2 into 2x for all the infinite x&#39;s.<br><br>DB = [Db0  Db1   Db2....Dbn....] --------------&gt; [0 b0 2b1 3b2....]<br><br>Which is equivalent to result we get from applying the offset matrix to a. <br><br>I think of it as instead of changing basis vectors as we do in the matrix on vector operation, we <b>keep basis vector same and change the combination.

For example, suppose you&#39;re going down the street with a friend of yours. All of a sudden, you say &quot;Look at that yellow car&quot; and you say whatever you wanted to say about the car in question. Now, a car has many properties: it can be big or small, fast or slow, etc. But of all the properties it has, you asked your friend to focus on one of its properties - in this case, the colour of the car. And that, is abstraction: you have an object (or a bunch of objects) and you focus in one or part of the properties that the object(s) has(have). In the case of Linear Algebra, you start with the following objects: vectors, matrices, functions, etc. On each of these objects, two operations are defined: a sum and a product of those objects by a scalar. This operations have several properties: the sum of two vectors (or matrices, or functions, etc.) is yet again a vector; the sum is commutative, etc. Of all the properties that this objects have, you focus on only 8 of these properties. What you get is an abstraction - an abstract vector space; and, in the reverse sense, each of the examples given is a concrete realisation of this abstraction. The next thing one should ask is: why bother doing such an abstraction? There&#39;s a quick result that motivates and justifies powerfully such an idea: let v be a vector of a vector space V (in the generalized and abstract manner just discussed; that is, you&#39;re not longer focusing on any particular example, but, rather, you change your point view and focus only on properties); given the (abstracted) properties of any vector space, it follows easily that 0.v=0 (I won&#39;t go through the proof). What this example shows, is that, instead of proving such a result first, for vectors, then for matrices, then for functions, if you start seeing things from an abstract point of view, all the results proved in an abstract manner will obviously also be proved for any concrete case! Imagine that! That&#39;s very, very smart and it allows you to save a lot of time. It also allows one to see the real nature of these objects. Abstraction then, is something very powerful and completely justified.", "comment_date": "2020-03-04T21:40:30Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Martin Bisca", "comment_text": "Wonderfully explained, great atmosphere, visually awesome, applauds", "comment_date": "2020-03-03T22:25:20Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "spenser", "comment_text": "having to mentally disassemble what my idea of a vector is is DIFFICULT", "comment_date": "2020-03-02T23:47:09Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Jin Wang", "comment_text": "Amazing serie!

We thought every one might benefit, but along the way towers of intellectual power served to deny to humanity its birthright, and hold this beautiful knowledge behind a one way mirror of entitlement.  Any well-taught subject is understandable to most people.  The Internet is finally making mathematics accessible to everyone.  Yes, in plain English, mathematics is a good ole boys club.  There are tiny enclaves of geniuses clutching the scraps of their Riemann Hypothesis proof unwilling to explain their work to anyone for fear of ridicule, or the off possibility that someone else will get the glory.  There are many socialization problems among mathematicians which are never spoken about.  The whole field needs the light of modernity to break in and revolutionize both our understanding and our estimation of its importance.  Augsburger\u2019s and other mood disorders run rampant among professors, and many students are put off by the inaccessible definitions and undesirable culture.  Though few will agree that that odd math professor who can\u2019t get into her garage because she never takes out her garbage is actually mentally ill because she\u2019s a genius, it might actually be time for the sake of education and the further progress of mathematics to have that discussion in all seriousness.", "comment_date": "2019-10-08T13:26:31Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "ali gerami", "comment_text": "Thank you so much!&lt;3", "comment_date": "2019-10-08T05:20:42Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "John Byrne", "comment_text": "Now do tensors!

One of the things I appreciate, beside of the very high quality content and &quot;worked&quot; videos (i.e. some good graphic and fine tuned animations, which take time to make, not just some idiots filming their cats), is the missing of full-screen advertising. I watch most of the videos in high speed (not only in this series, I mean generally, all subjects, including funny cats and dogs :P), and I only pause, rewind, or go to slow speed when I can&#39;t understand something or need a longer comprehension time. I know many people doing that, because the time is precious and many materials won&#39;t justify wasting it. However, as youtube works now, it will switch to normal speed (and generally lose all the custom settings) after full-screen ads are shown. Which means additional time wasted (and nerves) to set everything again. Therefore, videos showing full screen ads will usually end in a thumb down in the following 20 seconds, close tab, and switching to other tab where other videos are waiting to be watched, and that&#39;s the best thing greedy youtubers get.", "comment_date": "2019-06-30T07:19:51Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Fitim Zenuni", "comment_text": "if it was for me i would give you nobel prize for....<br>.<br>.<br>.<br><br>goodness<br><br>From the first  time i saw your a video of yours my soul is healed and i startet falling in love with math.<br>You are like Euler lvl:17<br>&quot;Euler lacked only one thing to make him a perfect genius: He failed to be incomprehensible.&quot; -Frobenius", "comment_date": "2019-06-28T22:13:38Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Alexander Bell", "comment_text": "Keep your work up!", "comment_date": "2019-06-28T19:36:27Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Arshdeepsingh Sandhu", "comment_text": "i fucking love you grant", "comment_date": "2019-06-28T14:56:03Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Roshan\u2019s School of Thoughts", "comment_text": "Thank you very much for a very good series on Linear algebra.", "comment_date": "2019-06-27T20:32:17Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Matt Raymond", "comment_text": "I&#39;m sorry but this is just dank", "comment_date": "2019-06-27T09:59:36Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Chen", "comment_text": "I watched 15 episodes in 1 week non-stop<br>It just... beautiful<br>Thank You", "comment_date": "2019-06-26T11:13:57Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Linux Authority", "comment_text": "&quot;pause &amp; ponder for a moment&quot;<br>That&#39;s what I&#39;ve been doing!<br>Thank you!", "comment_date": "2019-06-25T17:38:31Z", "likes_count": 97}, {"comment_by": "Yibei Huang", "comment_text": "I stood up and applauded!!

I&#39;ve never known what a determinant actually was! And what the heck was &#39;k&#39; ? I have a couple of years of civil engineering and commonly used matrices to solve multiple sets of equations to solve force diagrams. I just thought of it as math magic without knowing what was actually going on! How you tied it all together with functions and calculus at the end of your lectures, I found stunning in how it\u00a0was all related! Excellent graphics and a nice choice of enter and exit music.

A new video that focuses on a real world application and demonstrates a practical use for linear transformation principles might make everything much more clear (with maybe a few secondary applications). For instance, showing a side-by-side view of a python IDE where you highlight sections of source code, for some sample animation or video game, and perhaps make an alteration which you could probe and test live to demonstrate a math concept further (you a very similar thing to what I&#39;m describing, although only in passing, in at least one of the videos in this series). <br><br>This way, it is clear for both Physics and Computer Science students how each seemingly pedantic topic is applied in the real world. However, to highlight the math it would be best to focus less on the syntax and grammar of the computer language in favor of the showing how the math translates to some visual phenomena like animation. Another good example of what I feel would be interesting and valuable is something similar to the following &quot;beauty of mathematics&quot; video which shows the live movement of values in math equations that fluctuate as we see the real-world phenomena occur. <br><br><a href=\"https://vimeo.com/77330591\">https://vimeo.com/77330591</a><br><br>Even though most of the examples do not appear to be depicted accurately, the message still comes across clearly.

By using phasors (e^(jwt) where j = imaginary i, w = frequency in radians/second, and t as time) we are using e^jwt as a basis for some space that describes the magnitude, frequency and phase of the components of interest (voltage, current, speed, acceleration, etc) of an oscillatory system. <br>For describing these systems in the time domain we use differentiation, itself a linear operator. The peculiar property of the exponential function to output an scaled version of itself upon differentiation is what makes it a good choice for a basis. Suppose f = e^jwt, and we use f as an input to the differentiator (a system). The output will be y = jw*(e^jwt) = jw*f. This expresses the input as a scaled version of itself. So e^jwt is an eigenvector, the system (e.g. differentiator) is an eigenfunction, and the eigenvalue is jw. <br><br>So this is why eigenbasis are useful? The fact that the output can be described as some scaled version of the input?<br><br>Would a non-linear or time-variant system be like a matrix where eigenvalues don&#39;t exist? and if so, would there be some higher dimensional or imaginary solution (for example in the case of a matrix applying rotation) where eigenvalues don&#39;t really exist but you kind of make them exist in another space to make the math work.<br><br>If so, could we make descriptions of non-linear or time-invariant systems using the same process as a rotation matrix?
