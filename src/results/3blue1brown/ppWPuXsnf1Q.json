You don&#39;t understand the math. I don&#39;t care for your lockdown math at all. Before I even watch this video I&#39;m going to show you the REAL lockdown math. Firstly, from 1940 to 1950, possibly due to the war ending, there was a 43% increase (in the UK) in the number of births per year by the end of the decade. It&#39;s now 2021 and we&#39;re already starting to see the  knock-on effect from that. There was an 8% increase in deaths in 2020 compared to the 5 year average based on data ONLY going as far back as 2015. What&#39;s also interesting to note is the fact that these excess deaths were all attributed to covid19 and the median age of the people who died of covid19 was 80. These were generally, people who were war babies reaching the predicted age of life expectancy which, on average, is 80. If you ACTUALLY do the math you can calculate that the number of deaths per year from 2020 to 2030 is going to increase by 43%, and that the median age of the excess deaths will be 80. Secondly, given the INEVITABILITY of the forecasted &quot;global pandemic&quot; of the war-babies reaching the age of life-expectancy now, the liar politicians and their fake news associates have an opportunity to invest in the big businesses set to inherit all the turf from all the small businesses that they can illegally force to shut down under the pretence of a harmless little &quot;coronavirus&quot; literally as harmless as the common cold or flu, which they can easily track with PCR testing (business opportunity there) and blame (by association) all the &quot;excess deaths&quot; on, and use to scare people into taking a &quot;vaccine&quot; against which is the global market for soul-erasing genetic-modification technology worth trillions of [insert name of global currency here], ESCPECIALLY if they FORCE people to have it. Thirdly, now that you see how easy it is to predict the crimes of the scum who are behind this scam and above the law, it&#39;s MUCH easier to predict REALITY. Here&#39;s the reality: It&#39;s a virus so harmless that the only way to know if you&#39;ve got it is by taking a test. It&#39;s a virus so harmless that the only people who died from it were the people who reached the average age of life expectancy, so it&#39;s impossible to know if the &quot;coronavirus&quot; is what killed them or whether they are just the &quot;excess deaths&quot; expected from the war-baby boom 80 years ago?", "comment_date": "2021-02-22T13:38:07Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Shivaraj Nidavani", "comment_text": "why does it look like he has lipstick on. not being nasty im very thankful for his teaching", "comment_date": "2021-02-10T22:25:40Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "fox hong", "comment_text": "wow! you are so awesome~", "comment_date": "2021-02-05T13:27:41Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "gurjot singh bedi", "comment_text": "You are great Grant", "comment_date": "2021-01-31T03:39:42Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "stephane leroi", "comment_text": "First thanks so much for your wonderfull videos !<br>I have a question for you : <br>I have a child of 5 years, do you know a good youtube channel or other stuff where he can learn good geometrics and calculation ?", "comment_date": "2021-01-25T08:03:38Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Tal Adiv", "comment_text": "Should Grants voice be sampled for analysis and future use?", "comment_date": "2021-01-24T23:00:07Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "liamthedevastator", "comment_text": "No filler words, absolutely fantastic to listen to.", "comment_date": "2021-01-21T05:54:27Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Yaz Belinskiy", "comment_text": "There is something T1000 ish about Grant.

While those are pretty good tools, I think the development of technology, and the consequent increase in quality and quantity of tools to do math, allows for people to focus more on the theory, and even for development, while letting the computer do the demonstrations.<br>For instance, a few days ago I made a function that draws the tangent of any given point of a polynomial function. The function itself is kinda big, and it requires a lot of calculations, not to mention some of the process was more trial and error - just a couple tweaks. It was tedious and frustrating.
