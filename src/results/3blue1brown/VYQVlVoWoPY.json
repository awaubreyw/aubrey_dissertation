I can&#39;t seem to really understand it. Nr. 1 and Nr. 3 were easy enough, but Nr. 2 seems to be not fully explained/it seems like i&#39;m missing something.<br><br>As far as i understand, for the length of the limit: The limit refers to what the curve approaches through the various iterations. So what is being done is to first figure out what the curve approaches through the iterations( a circle), then figure the length of said circle.<br><br>The limit of the length on the other hand refers to measuring the length during each iteration. <br>len(initial curve) = 8,<br>len(curve after 1 iteration) = 8,<br>len(curve after 2 iterations) = 8,<br>etc. This is always 8 and never changes.<br><br>The problem for me is: He never (to me) seemed to explain why they end up not being the same in the end.<br>Because: He did follow it up with the proof of a smaller and smaller error in regards to integrals, something akin to this being required to make it rigorous. This makes sense. The problem there for me is that throughout the iterations of the &quot;folding the curve inwards towards the circle&quot; method, the error does decrease aswell as far as i can tell. <br><br>Example of what i would consider: For any 2 points that touch the circle which are connected by a third point (e.g. in the initial curve, top-middle and middle-left, connected by the top left corner), connect said 2 points to form a triangle. This could be considered a rough estimate of the error by taking the area of that triangle. In the next iteration, you can take the 2 new triangles(made in the same way) that now exist &quot;in it&#39;s place&quot; and calculate their area. The area has decreased. This seems to be true for any given iteration step. The whole &quot;the actual error is less than the measured area&quot; argument he used for the integral also applies, as the new edge &quot;cuts through&quot; the circle. So measured error is bigger than real error. Hence real error must be even less in every iteration step.<br><br>From there, i would assume it is reasonable to argue and be able to proof somehow that this error will also decrease steadily to 0. As such, i see no real difference between the circle and the area under the curve.<br>I&#39;m trying to see why this seemingly only fails at the limit based on my understanding, but not at any particular step towards said limit. Or, if i&#39;m wrong, where did my error-checking method fail and not work. Aswell as, any other error-checking method that could be thought of also not working for some reason. Because mine not working wouldn&#39;t mean any other does not work. After all, if one would work, then the result would differ.<br><br>It seems weird that you can presumably get arbitrarily close to the circle with what i layed out for myself, and still have a length of 8, yet when you have a circle it&#39;s not for some reason. So any &quot;almost circle&quot; would have a length of 8 yet a circle does not, with no inbetween steps going from 8 to 2pi. Almost like a quantum system where energy levels are quantized. Of course, there are always infinitely many steps between the limit and any given iteration, but i simply don&#39;t see why the pattern would break.

The other half is on the collatzconjectureproof page on my website which I&#39;m sure you know by now.<br><br>In the proof to the Collatz conjecture we use 3 types of odd numbers<br><br><br>A number divisible by 3 (3n) 9,15,2, 27 etc<br><br><br>A 3n+2 11,17, 23, 29...etc<br><br><br>A 3n-2 13, 19, 25, 31...etc<br><br><br><br><br>When we do this we spot a pattern.<br><br><br>1. Every division by 2^odd number (2,8,32,128 etc) leads to a 2+1<br><br><br>2. Every division by 2^even number leads to a 2-1.<br><br><br><br><br>3. There are 2 functions which lead to the same stop-start value of x only 1234 can satisfy both functions simultaneously.<br><br><br>3x+1\u00f72^n<br><br><br>3x+1/3\u00f72^n<br><br><br>Some 2 separate numbers can together satisfy both functions to arrive at the same stop-start number but they cannot be in the same sequence.<br><br><br><br><br>Because<br><br><br>For a loop there must be 2 ways in and one way out. This is not possible.<br><br><br>4. A number can have 2 ways in and one way out for example 47 can be reached by 31\u00d73+1\u00f72 or by 125\u00d73+1\u00f78 but the 2 ways in cannot happen in the same sequence.<br><br><br>4a. Because both come from an initial number that must be part of the sequence, for example 27 is the starting x which leads to the number 31\u00d73+1\u00f72=47 but 27 is divisible by 3 so cannot be the arrived at by a descent from 3x+1\u00f72. 97 is a 3n-2 which cannot be descended into from above because.<br><br><br>4b. A starting x that is a 3n-2 cannot be descended into from above because in order for a 3n-2 to be arrived at by the function 3x+1\u00f72 it must be arrived at from below because any (3n-2)\u00d73+1\u00f72 can only happen where that 3n-2 is a lower value than the initial x because in order to arrive at the same slope between x and 2x it must also satisfy the slope between x and 4x (3x+1/3) in a direct descent so therefore any 3n-2 must arrive at most at 2x. So therefore such stop start number would be a 3n+2. If it is a 3n+2 then 2x must at most be 1/2 of 1/4 of 8x which has the same slope as between x and 2x relative to 0 but this is impossible because then the 8x would be 16x relative to the stop start number which is impossible because all divisions by 2^even number (base 4) end in a 3n-2.\u00a0 \ufffc<br><br><br>So there can be no descent from higher up it must come from below. There cannot be any number within infinity that can satisfy this requirement because the 1st number to violate the descent to 1234 must theoretically come from above (which I have just shown is impossible) not below because all lower numbers would have already decended to 1234.<br><br><br>4c. No 2 different 3n+2 can descend at the same slope to arrive at the initial value of X see illustration attached.<br><br><br>No 2 3n+2 numbers can both satisfy the same end number after 3x+1\u00f72^n because any 2 numbers satisfying the function descend at a different slope relative to a direct line to 0 so cannot both arrive at the same slope that is between x and 2x in a direct descent.\u00a0 So any initial x must have been arrived at from only one possible route, a sequence which must begin at the initial value of x (or lower which as already established is impossible because the theorised 1st number to violate the drop to 1234 cannot be arrived at from below). Also because for any theoretical slope to arrive at the stop-start x which is a 3n+2 it must satisfy 3x+1\u00f72 from (a) a lower value of x which must have been arrived at from operations of the function beginning at the initial x which means a descent from a higher value of 3x+1 also is impossible because then it cannot also satisfy the function 3x+1/3 to descend into the same slope between 2x and x. If it did arrive from higher it cannot also arrive from lower which is obvious but may not be obvious to anyone under stress.<br><br><br>So no loop is possible arising from any number within infinity for these simple reasons.

Can you solve it?<br>There is a perfect mirror sphere. The middle, central point is located in xyz [0,0,0] and the radius of this sphere is R=0.5 m (Diameter = 1m). There is one enter/exit point on the surface of this sphere. The size of this point is just enough that single photon can enter the sphere. Let\u2019s assume the photon enter straight line and bouncing perfectly inside the sphere, there is no energy loss or any direction change. The photon is forever and if the sphere is still it will enter the sphere, bounce back and live it the same path it\u2019s enter (just one bounce and in this case the total distance the photon travel inside the sphere will be 2m. Now the problem to solve. The initial enter point is located xyz [0,0,1] so inline with Z axis. Let\u2019s assume this sphere is special one and it is rotating instantly each time the photon is passing its middle point [0,0,0]. This rotation is special. Every time the sphere is rotating clockwise of 1/360 but around only one axis. It is starting with X axis, next rotation around Y axis and next around Z axis. Then forever in the loop X,Y,Z etc. What happen to poor photon inside the sphere? The photon is always and endless bouncing inline the Z axis , each bounce has 1m distance. The photon will be trapped inside the sphere until the entrance/ exit point will be back in original position and the photon will be just after last bounce and passed already the middle point [0,0,0] so there will be possible to exit the sphere. Question : How long the photon will stay inside the sphere? How many bounces it takes before leaving? The speed is 300 000 km/s. Can you solve it?

SSA can produce two different triangles, as the angle between the two known sides can be different and produce two different possible triangles, based on where on side intersects with the ray drawn by the angle of one side. What I said probably makes no sense because I&#39;m terrible at explaining things, but essentially SSA on its own is not enough to prove a triangle&#39;s congruency. Now, while I have some doubt that CPE and BPF are not congruent triangles there probably exists some other method to prove that they&#39;re congruent, and what 3blue1brown said about the actual reason the proof is untrue is still correct and I didn&#39;t even notice it.

The reason is as follows:<br><br>Consider a circle. <br><br>If you draw a segment between two points in its circumference and consider a third point, the only way you can divide the angle the third point does with the other two in two equal angles is if you slice the &quot;circumference segment&quot; (the curve in the circle) between the 2 points (and that does not include the third one) into 2 equal &quot;circumference segments&quot; (we can prove this is indeed the case using circle properties along its center and angles inside of it). <br><br>Now, that new point in the circumference would most certainly be in the angle bisector because the way we made it be. <br><br>And the reason why it would be in the perpendicular bisector is because you can then make a segment between the center of the circle and the point and show that segment is indeed perpendicular to the segment of the 2 inicial points<br><br>Anyways, that is a very laconic way of putting it, considering that I don&#39;t have acess to drawing a picture here on YouTube and thus some pieces of info are kinda out of place, but I hope I could shed some light in the reasoning of this last problem", "comment_date": "2022-07-08T16:50:17Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Peter Coates", "comment_text": "I was a gullible math student.

Okay, I feel like the whole limit thing is kind of a bullshit thing to do, aslong as you&#39;re continuing to use logical proofs in it, like I feel it should be that you can&#39;t use a limit in math unless you&#39;re also using a kind of infinite visualisation tool at the same time. Liek for that one, the problem is that no matter how &quot;it is exactly&quot; the circle it is, it is made of constant jagged edges, there maybe an exactness in terms of poitns, but for the sake of it being a limit it has to be recognised that length wise it has all these jagged edges, it&#39;s not connected from each point to the next, rather it&#39;s doing infinite invisible right angles all accross it. It can&#39;t be taken as exactly a circle, but only like a fractal who&#39;s points are infinitely same, but to truly apply a limit-thing to it, we gotta bring pythagoras there. Like atleast connecting the points might eat into the circle a little, but would actually connect those infinite points in straight lines rather than jagged edges, and then the whole thing will be like an infinite  pythagorean problem, but atleast it&#39;s not a fake &quot;exactly the same&quot; but a more accurate infinite pointed regular polygon, which you can realistically argue including both edges and points that it is a circle. I really hate maths man, it&#39;s like there should me rules in place to not use logic in maths like this. like it&#39;s a fake logic, even considering the calculus arguement, taking an average curve of points is on thing, but still those bars are still gonna yield the same nonsense as this proof does. Like the only reason he can do that is because he is doing something fake with the limit thing, like i don&#39;t know how to describe it, but maybe limits should only be allowed to be used once you can put down rules of infinite visualisation, which is kind of a intuitive thing so, then what what would those even be, at the very least at limits where the &quot;curve&quot; itself isn&#39;t in the same &quot;directionality&quot; it should be recognised as something that&#39;s not natural maths, like it&#39;s not something that actually counts even tho logic can be argued about it, because in any situation really, logic kind of breaks down in the infinites. Sorry about the tone of this comment, it&#39;s just really getting to me for some reason.<br><br>Also the first proof is even more hard to see, but that feels like more because of fast speaking and visualisation difficulty. Here&#39;s the thing, those slices won&#39;t actually be triangles, even if many many of them, simply because if the were triangles, they would have to produce a double sided cone, since only then the pieces would be actual triangles, now that you&#39;re imagining a double sided cone(like a cone on itself) it makes more sense right, only if the triangles are &quot;fattened&quot; into something curved can those create a sphere, so actually the pieces would be weird slightly curved triangles, but the limit thing makes us ignore that, but even limit tends to infinity, they almost look like triangle, but that almost is all the difference required put together to create a sphere instead of a double cone. That&#39;s why i really dislike limits man, sure in some cases using them turns out to not cause weird logic to create problems, but in other cases they just create tiny holes that can&#39;t be seen unless you intensely visualise it, and it still would be hard to argue in a verbal arguement without using the visualization capability of the mind to basically a ridiculous level, but also that&#39;s literally what limits do, like it makes it hard to visualize and you can say well this curve is like a straight line in the limit. but which curves are &quot;cool&quot; to do something like that with, and which are just creating a weird dissonance in the mind and make you go, &quot;ok cool whatever, sure, in this case it counts so okay it should count there as well&quot;, but it&#39;s like we don&#39;t or can&#39;t determine it before hand exactly which cases count for limits to be comparable.<br>Maybe that&#39;s what math needs, like a system through which human mind trickery possiblilities are mapped out to .. something, and then when you&#39;re doing any kind of math ,you&#39;d be aware that this particular kind of proof or something or an aspect of it is capable to trick the mind, and then we look up the guide to check how to avoid falling into that mental trap.<br><br>Man, recently i watched a bunch of math videos, where one of them was like, well maths is literally made up, so many new things don&#39;t make sense but they axiomise by going &quot;let it be so that it doesn&#39;t need to be logical in this way&quot; and it&#39;s just cool, because the way we do math is a made up thing, and they can just do that with stuff and call it a different area to not interfere, and then many of these things that don&#39;t make any logical sense at all, end up being useful to science in some way or another, and my mind just exploded, like that&#39;s just impossible to digest, like is the universe itself constantly incosistent and doesn&#39;t make sense in comparing with itself, or even in different ways the theories are presented to be used in one way or another, and the logically nonsense math somehow ends up being helpful here. Like I feel like this is simply something so inconcludable, that just wtf. Like maybe all these broken proofs are helpful to some broken theory about a broken observation , (which i don&#39;t even know what that &quot;broken&quot; would even mean) and it&#39;s like okay cool, let&#39;s continue doing science, like what?<br><br>After watching the full video XD::<br>Man the last proof&#39;s flaw was hilarious, like i didn&#39;t even expect it and got completely mind fcked XDDD", "comment_date": "2022-07-08T14:27:06Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Julian G", "comment_text": "Are the lines AP and DP not aligned with each other for isosceles triangles?

Curvature is amazingly described by a tensor field, which is the technical way to say that it&#39;s intrinsic and its value at a point depends only on the vectors tangent to the surface at that point. In other words, it&#39;s not generally true that curved spaces look locally flat (in the way that mathematicians use that term). <br><br>What you&#39;re describing is better understood through parallel transport, which intuitively is like moving a vector along a curve without changing its orientation. The relevant result here is that if you parallel translate a vector along some triangle on a curved surface, you don&#39;t typically end up with the same vector you started with. They are only the same to a first order approximation (with respect to the side lengths of the triangle). The second order term is exactly the curvature at your starting point. So if you shrink the side lengths of the triangle, the original vector and its parallel transport become closer to being the same. This is morally akin to saying &quot;the surface is locally linear.&quot; But linear is a dangerous word here, because it refers to vector space structures and the use of calculus.

We define the neighbourhood of x, Nx, to be the interval (x- dx/3, x + dx/3) ie the middle third of this safe area.<br><br>As each value of x is the middle of the corresponding Nx, all the Nx s together cover the whole range. And they are all open sets. So, because the line interval is compact, we can select a finite number of them which between them cover the whole length. This is important because, while the dx s for all the Nx s may go smaller and smaller, for only a finite number of Nx s there must be a positive lower limit dmin which is &gt;0. Let d be dmin/3. And let us insist that the rectangles can be no wider than d.<br><br>Now, take any value k in the range. At k, the function has the value f(k) and the rectangle has the height f(m) for some m within d of k. k must be in a selected neighbourhood Nx for some x. k is within d of x, and so m must be within 2d of x. This is still within the &quot;safe area&quot;, so f(k) and f(m) are both within e&#39; of f(x) and so are within 2e&#39; of each other.", "comment_date": "2022-07-06T19:29:35Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Samira Peri", "comment_text": "I dunno about you but the triangle proof looked off immediately.

If I had to guess, I would say that the error goes to 0 if and only if the function is continuous almost everywhere.<br><br>If I am correct on this point, then it is quite simple to construct an example where the error does not go to 0: the Dirichlet function, which assigns 1 to rational numbers and 0 to irrational numbers. Let&#39;s examine this function on [0,1]. It is easy to show that this function is continuous nowhere, so it is not Riemann integrable on [0,1], or any interval for that matter. Thus, the &quot;error&quot; would not approach 0.<br><br>However, this prompts the question of how we would even define &quot;error&quot; anyway, which is closely related to how we would define area. One possible definition for area under a curve is the Riemann integral of that curve, provided that the integral exists. Thus, error would be defined as the magnitude of the difference between the approximated area, with whatever approximation we are using, and the Riemann integral. If we take this to be our definition, then in our previous example, we can&#39;t even say that the error doesn&#39;t approach 0 because the error is not even defined.<br><br>I also know that another way to define area would be Lebesgue measure on R^2, but unfortunately, we did not get to cover this in my analysis courses (we only discussed Lebesgue measure on R). Thus, I do not know whether the region between the Dirichlet function and the x-axis from x=0 to x=1 is Lebesgue measurable, or if this would coincide with the Lebesgue integral of this function from 0 to 1.

Picture the top point leaning towards the right.<br>2. Bisect the bottom side of the triangle and draw a line from the top angle to the bisection point.<br>3. Let&#39;s call the top two angles A1 (on the left) and A2 (on the right) and the lengths of the corresponding opposing sides (that together make up the bisected line) &#39;a&#39; (we can use the same for both because they&#39;re equal). Let&#39;s call the line from the top to the bisection point L, and the remaining angles of the original triangle B (on the left) and C (on the right).<br>4. The law of sines says that the proportion of the sine of an angle to the length of the opposite side is equal for all angles of the triangle. So for the left triangle section, Sin(A1) / a = Sin(B) / L and for the right triangle section, Sin(A2) / a = Sin(C) / L.<br><br>Divide one equality by the other and you get<br>Sin(A1)/Sin(A2) = Sin(B)/Sin(C)<br>Remember that our top point is biased towards the right side of the perpendicular bisector, which if you look at the triangle, you can tell that angle B is greater than angle C. This leaves two possibilities:<br>1. Both B and C are acute which means, since Sin between 0 and 90 degrees only goes up as the angle increases (look at a graph of a Sine wave if you don&#39;t believe me, the top of the first &quot;hump&quot; going right is 90 degrees), and angle C is greater than angle B, so Sin(C) &gt; Sin(B)<br>2. B is potentially obtuse, which means you have to do a bit more work<br>The sine of an obtuse angle equals the sine of its supplement (180 degrees - that angle) and since there are only 180 degrees in the triangle in the first place, A + B + C = 180, so 180 - C has to be B + A, which means the supplement of C is more than B and therefore Sin(C) &gt; Sin(B)<br><br>Now that we&#39;ve proven Sin(C) &gt; Sin(B), that means Sin(B) / Sin(C) is less than 1 (larger denominator than numerator). Which since Sin(A1)/Sin(A2) = Sin(B)/Sin(C), Sin(A1)/Sin(A2) is also less than 1. Again, the larger denominator than numerator required to get a quotient less than 1, means Sin(A2) &gt; Sin(A1). <br><br>I will now prove A1 is acute. The angle between L and the left side of &quot;a&quot; is obtuse, because the top point is to the right of the perpendicular bisector; since A1 is in the same triangle as that angle, A1 must be acute (a triangle can&#39;t have two obtuse angles). This leaves two possibilities:<br><br>1. A2 is obtuse, which since A1 isn&#39;t, means A2 &gt; A1, which means the angle bisector line is to the right of the line we&#39;ve currently drawn<br>2. A2 is acute, which for the reason stated earlier, Sin(A2) &gt; Sin(A1) when both are acute means that A2 &gt; A1, which means the angle bisector line is to the right of the line we&#39;ve currently drawn.<br><br>Boy that wound up being a lot longer than I intended it to be.

the square the points would somehow be more dense toward the original corners, but then i realized you easily could make that 1:1 correspondence by just casting a ray from the center point with a given angle, and for any possible angle that ray would intersect both the square and the circle at exactly one unique point for each. plus that would contradict the note you made about the set of points from the &quot;infinitely folded square&quot; function being precisely the same as the points of a circle. so now the best vague guess i have is that, because the points produced by our limit function do converge on a circle but the limit of the lengths between the points don&#39;t, it has something to do with how we&#39;re defining those lengths between the points. like both shapes have the same infinite set of points, but the 0-length segments we&#39;re connecting them with to measure the perimeter differ somehow. so.. basically just looping back to the &quot;it&#39;s too jagged&quot; argument. or maybe pi really is just 4 and Big Math has been suppressing this information all along to sell more scientific calculators\r<br>\r<br>3. this one had me puzzling real hard. i had a lot of false starts and quick conclusions that i jumped to based on the diagram, only to follow through the reasoning and conclude that no, everything here indicates each given pair of lines <b>should</b> be the same even if they don&#39;t look it in the drawing. i finally decided to try to get a better idea of what was happening by drawing some diagrams of my own, and that seemed to be where things started to fall apart. for every triangle i drew, using a straight-line tool in a paint program and trying to be as accurate as i could with the angles and bisectors, i found that the &quot;center&quot; point (which i did notice was taking 2 of the different possible ways you can define the &quot;center&quot; of a circle and sneakily mashing them together, which was fishy) always fell outside the triangle. and once that happens the rest kind of goes to shambles, you&#39;ve got those internal &#39;virtual&#39; triangles overlapping each other and segments that were supposed to be comprising part of a side of the original triangle extending out longer than that original side and it&#39;s a big mess that doesn&#39;t work anymore. the one exception i <b>did</b> find is that when you have an isosceles triangle and take the perpendicular bisector of the base and the angle bisector of the opposite corner, those are simply one and the same line. which still doesn&#39;t quite work because now that &quot;center point&quot; is an infinitely long line.\r<br>\r<br>so my proposition is that the clearly-a-bit-wonky angle bisector in your diagram is off <b>on purpose</b> to to set up a scenario where it looks close enough to a feasible real possible diagram, and then uses the faulty positioning of those elements to make arguments about the congruence of all those internal triangles and finally the lengths of the sides of the original triangle. basically, the arguments <b>would</b> be valid if the two angles marked &#39;a&#39; actually were equal to each other and the &quot;center&quot; point also fell inside the triangle, but it&#39;s impossible for both of those things to be true in a real, accurately drawn and bisected triangle. ultimately i&#39;m not sure i&#39;m super satisfied with this answer, since i don&#39;t know how i could more rigorously state what i think the issue is, and if it turns out i&#39;m just not drawing my triangles accurately enough or there&#39;s a particular sort of triangle that could have that sketchy combination-ortho-in-center point contained inside it then my argument might kinda fall apart. on the other hand, if the assertion is that <b>every</b> triangle is isosceles then proving that there&#39;s even one triangle where it doesn&#39;t work is at least good enough for the ol&#39; proof by contradiction\u2122, and it&#39;s 3 am now so i think i&#39;ll have to be satisfied with that lol<br><br><br>[edit to grade my own answers]<br><br>1. i would say i had pretty much the right idea. i think specifying that the segments you&#39;d get from &quot;peeling the orange&quot; wouldn&#39;t be triangular if you flattened them while preserving their area is something that was kinda floating in my head and would&#39;ve been a nice thing to note in particular if i&#39;d been a little more confident and had worked through with a bit more rigor, but ultimately &quot;you can&#39;t just peel a sphere and flatten it into perfect flat shapes without distortion&quot; was the right general idea (and you even showed an example of the foibles of map projection afterward so hey, i&#39;ll give me half a bonus point for drawing on that)<br><br>2. this was the one i least knew how to answer, and honestly even now it&#39;s the one i understand least still. i think the idea that those two limits can&#39;t just be trivially equated was like, more or less on the right track, it starts scratching at the spirit of it, but it&#39;s hard to give myself more than a consolation pat on the back there<br><br>3. i was SOOO relieved when you drew the triangle more rigorously and revealed the &quot;center&quot;

Can we add more dimensions by perception of the thought of going into a building, and accessing the inner workings of that building. Its like a duplicate of our normal dimensions, just alter it slightly to handle having them within themselves, or opposite direction. Visa, versa. You can go into areas, explore it, and equally go out of it. You can see something if the wave length is right or you can&#39;t see it because you aren&#39;t able to comprehend the wavelengths because they&#39;re smaller or way too large for us to comprehend but they still exist. Additionally to this could we add vibration/frequency. Density. Temperature differences. Velocity/rotation/energy. The power and impact of Static charge in space that plays a huge role in sticking things together to start a snowball effect of density, rotational momentum, magnetism, north south poles within electromagnetism that exists all over the universe. All that corelate from the base of positive and negative. Hot and cold. Less dense and more dense. Faster and slower. Higher pressure and negative pressure. Tight waves of light/sound/shockwaves and stretched out light/sound/shockwaves. We see these core aspects all over space play such huge roles in the behavior of everything we can observe in the natural world. Makes me day dream that maybe black holes are the doorways in that hypothetical other building dimension I was talking about. One that goes into another similar dimensions building as ours, maybe it is the same one, it could just be accessing another part of the building then we once was in. Even if traveling at the speed of light, we cannot reach past a certain point, ever. Maybe that boundary, that speed limit threshold is possibly &quot;inaccessible parts of the universe based off of the speed of light, unless you possibly find a different path?&quot; so maybe this is where the doorways connect? Who knows? I still have this gut feeling that its maybe possible black holes recycle energy though.. How, or what, or where, I do not know. But I have observed nature and the natural world enough to know for sure that nature does not create systems that are wasteful. No. Nature, if its incorporated its behaviour or systems through out then I really feel nature implements those systems for a reason. And wasting things for utterly no reason is never the reason. Nature doesn&#39;t just waste things. In fact it seems to never cease to surprise us at how its able to take things we would consider waste and finds amazing great ways to convert things and repurpose stuff to assist in something else. That&#39;s why my gut tells me black holes dont waste energy. Idk how but I just feel nature would naturally convert the energy the same way nature converts the energy from salmon when they pass away inland. Or when a tree falls and fungi convert the energy from the trees and keeps the entire forest from suffocating on itself.

Trying to figure out what&#39;s wrong with the proofs:<br><br>1. I assume the sphere problem is that the first proof assumed the wedges were triangles and that they fit together, whereas since the sphere has curvature, the wedges would be kinda rounded, thus not fitting correctly together, thus leaving holes and/or overlaps in the rectangle formed with the limit approach.<br><br>2. The circle perimeter/ pi=4 one has got me. The idea of the limit feels right, although what we&#39;re clearly doing is reducing the area of outside space between the circle and sequence of rectangular corners. What is being done almost feels like trying to say a rope is the same length as the circumference of a circle by scrumpling it around said circle, so it feels kinda &quot;intuitively&quot; wrong, but I can&#39;t really explain why it&#39;s mathematically wrong. I think the &quot;limit&quot; we could make use of for the shape would be to approximate or determinate the area of a circle, but not it&#39;s circumference. <br><br>3. For the isoceles triangle one, I tried making a triangle with 2 very long sides and a very short one. Since there was nothing about choosing the starting corner, I took the one where it obviously shouldn&#39;t work and clearly it&#39;s not possible to create the point P (connection between the line that splits the corner angle in half and the line that splits the opposing side in half perpendicularly? orthogonally?) inside the triangle. That&#39;s enough to say that not any pair of 2 edges from a triangle are always of equal length. However, if there are triangles where the point P exists inside the triangle, then at this point I&#39;m kinda stumped as to what&#39;s actually wrong with the proof, unless this property is only true for actual isoceles triangles (where I&#39;d assume the point would then fall directly on the 3rd edge, right in the middle, not really inside the triangle, making the proof a bit more trivial to complete since there&#39;d only be 2 sub-triangles necessary).<br><br>For anyone reading this, sorry for the rambling...

The diagonals would be equivalent of the average between the heights of rectangles above and below the curve.<br>The circle is roughly along those horizontal/vertical directions at 4 points by the axes and at an angle everywhere else up to 45 degrees.) The section around the 45 degree mark is being estimated as length 2(line lengths around a corner) instead of sqrt(2) so the total needs to be reduced by a factor that varies from 1 at the axes and 1/sqrt(2) at the 45 degree line.) As a first guess approximation you could try taking some kind of average between 1 and sqrt(0.5)=0.7071... and multiplying it by 4 to get the next best approximation to pi - and getting 3.4142... which looks quite close with the 1&#39;s and 4&#39;s swapped over! (or 3.36358... using a geometric average) Checking the average for diagonals at around 15 degrees and 30 degrees as well I got reduction factor that estimated pi as about 3.1725... quite a bit closer. The smaller angles you use and check the line lengths and diagonals for them, the closer to pi it should get. I guess it depends how accurately you can draw the circle and its line sections (by hand or on computer using Paint, which I just did for a roughly approximated circle with sections of lengths given by certain numbers of pixels).<br>The &#39;triangles&#39; you made from flattened sections of the sphere needed the strange property that the height is the same as the length of the curved sides, so they would need to bulge out at the bottom as well, not just on those curved sides, but it doesn&#39;t work if you want to keep all the angles the same as they were on the sphere! Otherwise it doesn&#39;t look like all the overlapping sections would add up enough to be three times the area of the flat triangles !<br>Mmm...

In the case of the square diagonal, no matter how small the steps, the length is always \u221a2 times the true diagonal; in the case of the circumference, no matter how small the steps, the length is always 4/\u03c0 times the true circumference.

Euclid uses several visual proofs in his <i>Elements</i> which are fallacious by modern standards, but whenever his axioms were sufficient for a more rigorous proof, he gave the better one. It&#39;s as if he recognized the deficiencies in some of his proofs but just knew of no better proof. Some of these are sort of trivial, like his very first proposition for the construction of an equilateral triangle (which assumes without proof that two circles, each passing through the other&#39;s center, must intersect), but others are absolutely essential to the axiomatic system he is setting up. His fallacious proof of SAS congruence might be the best example, because it is pretty much impossible to interpret in the modern day. He simply does not invoke his own axioms at all, instead using some sort of argument by translation, presumably based on what he felt was obvious.<br><br>And I like the example of arclengths too, because ancient geometers suspected that it was simply impossible to define the length of an arc that wasn&#39;t piecewise straight. Archimedes disagreed and introduced some clever elementary axioms that allowed him to prove things about the circumference of a circle and surface areas of a cylinder, cone, and sphere. He was mostly interested in convex curves, because proving anything about general curves was not feasible using the tools of the time. This example of nonconvex polygons approaching a circle pointwise might not have been known to Archimedes, but a similar example of them approaching a right triangle probably was. These apparently paradoxical cases (where the limit of the arclengths of a sequence of curves does not equal the arclength of their pointwise limit, even though both are defined) might have dissuaded him from tackling nonconvex curves altogether.
