Not the notation is the problem, it&#39;s how its taught to people -- a unified notation already exists!<br><br>Take <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sULa9Lc4pck&amp;t=1m25s\">1:25</a> for example. One of the first things we learned in university math courses was that roots are the inverse of power, but our teacher never used the root symbol at all (at least not for the first weeks), he always used the power notation, i.e. sqroot(2) = 2^1/2 because then you could use the usual power rules to reduce roots and powers. <br>This then also leads to very nice properties that you can reduce any root with any power in a simple and already known way. For example, in the usual, usually high-school taught notation, calculating root_5(69) * 69^5 (where root_n(x) is the n-th root of x) seems very daunting since you need to first calculate the 5th root of 69 (nice) and then multiply it with the 5-th power of 69 (again nice). Most people would use a calculator for that.<br>Instead by expressing roots as an inverse power we now can write 69^1/5 * 69^5 = 69^1, and that&#39;s easy to calculate.<br>It also makes inverse notations very easy, since now you can simply use (root_5(69))^n = (69^1/5)^n = 69^1/5*n to find n and get the inverse, since you just need to look at the power term and solve it for 1, in this case 1/5*n = 1 =&gt; n = 5<br><br>And that&#39;s what Grants &quot;triangle of power&quot; does, it&#39;s just a more artistic way for what I described above; which might be the thing for some students. But from his video it&#39;s not entirely clear how he came up with all of this. Why are the bottom corners always multiplication? Why isn&#39;t one division or subtraction? Yes, it unifies the notation (a bit) but it&#39;s completely different that everything so far and I still have to remember three triangles based on which corner stays constant -- not ideal.<br><br>With the notation above this becomes a non factor, you just need to remember how for example roots are written as powers, i.e.<br>* root_n(x) = x^1/n and therefore: root_n(x^m) =&gt; x^m/n<br>* x^-n = 1/x^n<br><br><br>Long story short: Teach concepts, not notation. <br><br><br>P.S.

I know this video is 3 years old but here we go:<br><br><br>I&#39;m an algebraic person. I love to express things algebraically, not geometrically. I don&#39;t like dealing with shapes and graphs. I like dealing with symbols and numbers. I&#39;ve found the notation in this video (specifically the section at <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sULa9Lc4pck&amp;t=3m30s\">3:30</a>) difficult to follow. And the property of adding powers when multiplying numbers of the same base doesn&#39;t seem any easier or harder with this method. It&#39;s just exactly the same. You seem to recognize, yet not fully understand that more important than knowing the correct notation is understanding what the notation means.<br><br><br>I could understand how if you, lets say a student, seeing log2(8) = 3 for the first time might make you confused, but if you don&#39;t recognize that log is the inverse of an exponential, for which your output now becomes your input, and vice versa,  then I wouldn&#39;t expect you to understand the notation. You have to understand that where some function y = a^x answers the question of what is the value of &quot;y&quot; if it is equal to &quot;a&quot; multiplied by itself x amount of times, loga(y) = x answers the question how many times do I multiply &quot;a&quot; by itself to get the value &quot;y&quot;. In this way, the log notation is actually intuitive, as the base remains the same. And just like the first step to finding the inverse of a function, only the question and answer swap places. Maybe writing a^y = x, where y is a subscript instead of a superscript might make more sense, and if I could invent notation that&#39;s probably how I might&#39;ve done it.<br><br><br>The square root symbol is also kinda wonky. I remember when we first learned that it was just a half-power, people were confused and started memorizing. Including me. But if we just left powers as fractions instead of using that symbol from the start, things would be fine. It&#39;s weird to students because when you square root, you don&#39;t write the 2 in the symbol, but you do write numbers 3 and above, and usually in math, not writing a value means there&#39;s a &quot;secret 1&quot;. Just like how x =  1*x. But if students wrote a 1 with the square root symbol, that would mean a number to the power of 1, which just equals that number, and chaos ensues. It should just be left as a fractional power because that&#39;s exactly what it is.<br><br><br>The best way to teach math is to introduce a concept via proving it. In my first ever calculus class, we found derivatives to polynomials, lnx, and trigonometric functions by doing a quick proof either algebraically or geometrically. I will never forget how I independently found the derivative of cosx using the derivative of sinx and the identity sin(x)^2 + cos(x)^2 = 1. Never just say &quot;This is the derivative of tan. Memorize it.&quot; Instead, say &quot;how can we find the derivative of tan, seeing as though we already know the derivative of sin and cos and we know the quotient rule?&quot; It sucks that so many people are being forced to memorize math; because if that&#39;s the case, you&#39;re gonna find it difficult regardless.<br><br><br>I get that using the word &quot;log&quot; is arbitrary, but so is the cross/dot used for multiplcation and the cross and dash used for addition and subtraction. And when you try to express different exponential properties at <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sULa9Lc4pck&amp;t=4m36s\">4:36</a> using the triangle, it seems even more arbitrary than the current rules and requires even more memorization. A student might see this notation and then ask: Why a triangle? Why not a square? Is it just because there are 3 values involved, or is there something more to it? And it&#39;s good that you brought this up near the end.<br><br><br><br>I like the o-plus notation.

Writing operands in the order (bottom left, top, bottom right)\u2014i.e. left-to-right as they occur next to the triangle\u2014and using &quot;?&quot; for a missing symbol, we have that (A, B, ?) is matrix product, (?, A, id_n) is left inverse and (A, ?, id_m) is right inverse.

Also, I&#39;d want a good way of adding in three-way relationships between any reasonable combination of matrices, vectors and scalars.<br><br>Next thought is function composition. I have not gone anywhere with that. Maybe generic group operations?<br><br>Why arity 2? Well, 2 inputs + 1 output = 3 corners. Why non-commutative? Well, it gets a little bit boring if flipping does nothing; the three distinct corners in some sense have more information than the thing they&#39;re describing, which could get confusing. Why only those where we care about both inverses? Otherwise we obviously only utilize two thirds of our ability to omit values at corners.

I like it - finally I can understand the relations.<br>Just wondering, perhaps one can simplify the triangle of power by using just the relevant parts for exponents, roots and logs.<br>For example:<br>for exponents use the symbol / (2 to the power of 3 becomes 2/3);<br>for  roots use the symbol \\ (the cube root of 8 is 3\\8). <br>and for logs use _ (log 8 to be base 2 becomes 10_3).<br><br>These symbols are elegant because they appear as inverses of each other (with respect to a particular corner) and capture the same idea as the simple symbols for plus and minus, times and divide. They also preserve the orders of the current notation: e.g. 2/3 (for 2 to the power of 3), 3\\8 (the cube root of 8), and 2_8 (log base 2 of 8) .<br><br>The solution to each one of these operations is the point (or angle) opposite the slope of the line. In other words, the answer to 2/3 is going to be the right corner of the triangle (opposite the line /), and the solution to 2_8 is the top corner of the triangle.<br><br>The inverse of / is \\. <br>BASE: Therefore, 2 = 3\\(2/3) = 2/(3 divided by 3), AND, the base = 8 = 2\\(4/3) = 2\\64 =[ 4/y = 4/(3 divided by 2) = 4/1.5]<br>LOG: Also, 8 = 2/(2_8) =  2 to the power of log base 2 of 8 equals 8, AND, the log = 2/(4_64) =[ x_64 = 2_64]= 2/3 = 8 <br>Exp.: Also 3 = 2_(2/3) = log base 2 of 2 to the power of 3 equals 3, AND the exponent = 2_(4/3) =[ x/3 = 2/3 ]= 2_64 = 8<br><br>The full triangle, with all solutions, is visualised by 2/3\\8.

You are using a &quot;dot&quot; to mark the corner containing a &quot;constant value. And you use operation symbols (plus addition, etc) to mark the relation between the multiplication of triangles with the same base but different power. How do you do that? Well you just put a plus n the upper corner of the triangle and a multiplication siymbol in the lower right corner. And right here you break your owen rules concerning how to use that triangle! Why, because you are filling the corner with the empty value (the one that is to be calculated) with a symbol) having all three corners filled, which is, in my opinion confusing.<br>The way I understand you, is that what you really want to say, is that when multiplying two &quot;whole triangles&quot; which both have the same base, a different power and the lower right corner empty, you can replace this &quot;multiplication of triangles with empty lower right corners&quot; by a single triangle with empty right corner which happens to have the same base but shows in the upper corner an addition of the powers of the before mentioned trianges. Was this somehow understandable?<br>My suggestion.<br>Take the Picture at <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sULa9Lc4pck&amp;t=4m43s\">4:43</a>. Let the lower left corner with a point (because constant), but leave the lower right corner empty because thats the number to calculate (so you stay consistend with your initial rule) and put both symbols (multiplication and addition) in the upper corner.<br>But add a little triangle to the multiplication, which means: multipliaction of triangles with different values at exactly this corner is equal to one triangle with addition of the values in exactly this corner.<br>So please in the  section <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sULa9Lc4pck&amp;t=4m21s\">4:21</a> till <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sULa9Lc4pck&amp;t=4m45s\">4:45</a> of the video, please leave the lower right corner empty and put both signs in the upper corner. Maybe like this &quot;(x\u25b2)+&quot;.<br>Is my point, about the inconsistency of not leaving any corner empty when descrbing the identity made clear?<br>Hope it helps.

Intuitively this is starting to seem like a generalization of invertable functions, but for two parameters.

Call me a nit-picker, but I really, really don&#39;t like the idea of using a perfectly symmetric shape to represent a thoroughly asymmetric operation.<br><br>With that said, rather than throwing the whole proposal out with the bath water, perhaps it just needs to be tweaked a bit.  Replace the equilateral triangle with a less symmetric shape, such as perhaps a solid wedge, thicker and higher at the right than at the left.  Write the base (2, in the example) at the left, the exponent (3) to the right of the top of the wedge, like a superscript, and the power (8) to the right of and a bit lower than the wedge.  Then it&#39;s almost as vertically compact as a fraction, and it only gets vertically unwieldy if you need to nest it (which happens with fractions as well) or use it in conjunction with some other vertically non-compact thing (such as a fraction; and, again, this happens with fractions already, and we find ways to deal with it).", "comment_date": "2018-05-31T00:55:23Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Arun Janarthanan", "comment_text": "Two years now - since this video was published.

Second, the symbol is entirely symmetrical, but the actual operations it represents are very asymmetrical, and thus it&#39;s very misleading. The thing I like about all the different notations we have for power relations is that they are all asymmetrical, contrasting with the symbols for addition and multiplication which are symmetrical, so this new notation is confusing. Also, I disagree with where the operations are laid out in this plan, but there is no inherent reason any operation should be in any part of the triangle, so it&#39;s much more confusing to look and the triangle and try to piece out what operation it&#39;s supposed to represent then when the operations are explicitly laid our.

Furthermore, we typically like to think of exponentials and logarithms as functions, and the triangle notation butchers this.

Triangles with sub-triangles might make pleasing and (perhaps!) educational patterns, but they are not useful for someone actually working with mathematics. I can scribble the standard notations easily with pen and paper, they are easy to type-set for a paper, and it is straightforward to code them into a program. Drawing triangles is slower and more cumbersome (or outright impossible for text-based computer programs), and that simply will not do for a practitioner.<br><br>Furthermore, applied mathematics favours a &quot;goal-directed and operational&quot; approach. Goal: multiply base with itself exponent number of times, operation: raise to power. Goal: recover the base of a power operation, operation: take the root. Goal: recover the exponent of a power operation, operation: take the logarithm. In the vast majority of practical calculations only a handful of such operations need to be used, and usually in a sequential fashion (rarely does one find a tangled mess of powers, roots and logs, apart from artificial exercises). Speed and accuracy in practical calculations comes from knowing &quot;the right tool for the job&quot;, and the standard notation is tailored to that.<br><br>Let&#39;s take a more mathematical example, and to be fair, let&#39;s use an example from the video: a^x*a^y=a^(x+y) and log_a(u*v)=log_a(u)+log_a(v). The reason for writing the second equation with different symbols will become apparent shortly. Let us say that I have convinced myself of a^x*a^y=a^(x+y) previously, and now want to derive the log rule. What do I do? I define u=a^x and v=a^y, then write log_a(u*v)=log_a(a^x*a^y)=log_a(a^(x+y))=x+y=log_a(a^x)+log_a(a^y)=log_a(u)+log_a(v). Because I knew one rule (how powers combine) I can <b>derive</b> the other (how logs combine) simply by making use of what kind of operation the log is. Now explain to me how you do that with these triangle? No, I do not mean how to &quot;recognise the similarities&quot; once someone translates both rules into some triangle patterns. I mean the process of deriving one rule from the other in triangle notation. I would suggest that this is much harder, in particular if you do not &quot;cheat&quot; by simply translating the standard notation of the proof into triangles step by step. But this is the very sort of thing you actually want to do in math, derive new results by manipulating the known ones.<br><br>There may be some value in using this sort of notation for teaching in a school setting. That&#39;s not really my domain. However, I doubt very much that this will ever be adopted by practitioners (mathematicians, physicists, engineers, computer scientists, ...). And if it won&#39;t be, then this puts into question whether this should be taught at school, even if it perhaps makes some aspects easier to grasp. Because education should prepare children to become these professionals, or at least to have some basic grasp of what they are doing.

I&#39;m going to start tormenting my math teacher by insisting on using it, as it even makes it easier when you have these things memorized.<br><br>Now, on to the other thoughts:<br><br>Huh, the sin/cos/tan notations at the beginning are actually pretty good. Presumably csc/sec/cot (which are the reciprocals of sin/cos/tan, respectively) would be the same inverted, and asin/acos/atan/acsc/asec/acot would be the same with a line over it. I&#39;d prefer to drop the parentheses entirely though, except for disambiguation purposes.<br><br>Reciprocal could be represented with just an overline (no &#39;1/&#39; needed), functions should be something like [approximated] x -&gt;^f y, though there&#39;d have to be a way to handle multiple arguments (Just use a tuple, most likely; f(x, y) = z becomes [approximated] (x, y) -&gt;^f z).<br><br>I like Big Sigma and Big Pi Notations, but there&#39;s a better idea so they have to go. They are replaced with &#39;basket notation&#39; (which looks like a bigger, one-character version of |_|, joined at the top right to an overline over the formula (like in square roots) and optionally ending with a down serif). In basket notation, you write the initial state below, optionally a semicolon then the filter condition (so if, say, you only want to add primes, you do n=2; prime(n). Lack of the filter condition is interpreted as accepting any integer), the terminating condition above, the formula that x is applied to to the left, and the operation (or name of a function) inside the &#39;basket&#39;. Summation is a basket with a plus inside, Big Pi has a &#39;*&#39; (not a &#39;\u00d7&#39; because it looks too much like &#39;x&#39; when written), big conjunction (&#39;all&#39;) uses \u2227, big disjunction (&#39;any&#39;) uses \u2228, etc.<br><br><br>But what do I do for tetration/super-root/super-logarithm?<br><br>(Answer: Write the hyper-operation number in the middle of the triangle, <br>bounded in a square.)<br><br>Hyper-operations, for those not yet initiated are the generalization of <br>the sequence a*b ||= a+a+..(b)..+a, a^b ||= a*a*..(b)..(a), etc. <br>Tetration (a^^b here, usually uses an up-arrow) a^^b is <br>a^(a^...^(a^(a))...) with b a&#39;s. Multiplication is repeated addition, <br>exponentiation is repeated multiplication, tetration is repeated <br>exponentiation, penetration is repeated tetration, sexation is repeated <br>penetration.<br><br>This also leads to a fun extra operation- &quot;hyper-which&quot;- where you have <br>a[k]b = c, a, b, and c are known, and you need to find k. We can assume <br>k=3 when box-with-k is given.<br><br>Hyper-logarithm (traditionally log^*_b(x); means &quot;how many times do I need to chain log_b on x to get it \u22641?&quot;) needs a notation- but that should be simple, just do log with * in the normally-vacant corner.<br><br>The best criticism I&#39;ve seen of this is for compactification (it makes things rather large)- but the solution, to me, is simple: the full ToP is like a horizontal fraction bar or superscript exponentiation (which we&#39;re already killing); you use it as you can, but when space becomes an issue you switch to a more linear notation (for division, the obelus or normal slash, for exponents, a caret (^)). Compact notation for exponent is an upwards-pointing equilateral triangle, for root it&#39;s a right-pointing equilateral triangle (&#39;right is for root&#39;), and for logarithms it&#39;s a left-pointing equilateral triangle (&#39;left is for log&#39;)<br><br>I almost used the opposite directions before I realized there&#39;s a nice mnemonic there. In fact, why not make it ALWAYS true? A missing right corner is root, a missing left corner is log- everything looks a bit off at first starting from old math (the superscript looks like it&#39;s BEFORE the base), but it wouldn&#39;t be hard to get used to.<br><br>&quot;o-plus&quot; could be called &#39;harm&#39; or &#39;harmon&#39;, because 1/sum([1/k for k in S]) is the &quot;harmonic mean&quot;. The symbol, presumably, would look like something vaguely harmonic, like a semicircle or something (I&#39;m not good with harmony, OK?); yeah, how about a semicircle, with the baseline passing through the center, with a radius from the uppermost point?<br><br>While we can make new symbols, here&#39;s something that&#39;d be nice: use symbols that are symmetrical over a vertical axis ONLY for operations which are commutative (e.g. +, *); minus (both used for subtraction and negation) will be, I suppose, an inverted minus sign (exactly the same, but with a short serif leading up from the right endpoint). harmonic minus (which is 1/((1/a)-(1/b))) is a semicircle the same as harmonic plus, but the radius comes from the rightmost point.<br><br>On the topic of negation and symbols, reciprocal would look MUCH better if we could drop the 1 in 1/x entirely- just write x with an overline and it&#39;s implied to be 1/x.", "comment_date": "2016-09-23T01:01:32Z", "likes_count": 3}, {"comment_by": "Compilation Guy", "comment_text": "As a student in 11th grade...I won&#39;t really use the triangle of power often...but it really helped me understand the relationship of the three ideas...", "comment_date": "2016-09-21T10:56:15Z", "likes_count": 415}, {"comment_by": "Steve Kudlok", "comment_text": "It just seems like another way of doing things.

Of course, there is no harm in introducing them strictly as the lower left being the variable, the upper one being constant and the right one being the result you seek at first, and only afterwards telling them more.<br><br>It may give them the wrong impression, though, that implicit functions can usually be rewritten to be one explicit function on the whole domain (if you make the domain the positive reals, at least).
