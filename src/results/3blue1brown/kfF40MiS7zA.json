Follow the full playlist at <a href=\"http://3b1b.co/calculus\">http://3b1b.co/calculus</a><br><br>By the way, there is a piece of math, commonly called &quot;non-standard analysis&quot;, which makes infinitesimals a rigorous notion, thereby avoiding the need to use limits.  That is, in the real number system something like 0.000....(infinitely many 0&#39;s)...1 doesn&#39;t make sense, it&#39;s not an actual number.  But the &quot;hyperreal numbers&quot; of non-standard analysis are constructed so as to include a number like this.<br><br>I have no problem with that system.  I think it&#39;s great to invent new math and new number systems meant to rigorously capture a useful intuitive notion, although the construction of the hyperreal numbers requires some questionable usage of the axiom of choice.  But I do think it&#39;s important to first learn about limits, and how mathematicians made sense out of calculus using the standard real number line without resorting to infinitesimals.  It&#39;s not a matter of clinging to old systems, it&#39;s because limits help to gain a deeper appreciation for structure and character of the real numbers themselves, which in turn will help to understand any extension of those numbers.", "comment_date": "2017-05-04T16:52:15Z", "likes_count": 953}, {"comment_by": "Peeper", "comment_text": "I watched this series in spring 2020 during lockdown when I didn\u2019t even know how to \u2018differentiate x\u2019 because I had never touched calculus.

It uses circular reasoning. It uses the limit to define the derivative and the derivative to define the limit.  Given the definition of a limit and the delta/epsilon proof  then a derivative cannot be a limit as defined.  Why? Because the derivative is exact. The limit, by definition is not exact and can never be exact.  The  delta/epsilon proof  says you may  APPROACH as close as you wish BUT you are forbidden from ever reaching that point and you have no way of definitively stating what that point is. If you say it approaches 1 whose to say that it doesn&#39;t also approach  .999999999999999999999 or 1.00000000000000000000000001? You can&#39;t.  At the end of the day you make a guess as to what number is being approached.  This whole ambiguity over the limit is because mathematicians have yet to reconcile that ever present division by zero.  All kinds of inspired reasoning and factoring emerges to justify or hide it.   The very essence of calculus rests on the definition of the limit and yet it is the most flawed concept  in the entire discipline. <br><br>There are two simple solutions. The first  is refer to time mark <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kfF40MiS7zA&amp;t=8m26s\">8:26</a>. We may define a derivative simply as the midpoint of your output range.  You can use the same method for shrinking the secant down to the tangent.  The tangent and thus the derivative can be simply found by drawing a perpendicular line from the midpoint of the secant to the curve. The point of intersection is the derivative. Both techniques are simply an expression of Fermat&#39;s difference quotient and his suppression of \u201ce\u201d (Look up Fermat&#39;s approach to the maxima.) <br><br>The second method is simply to remember that x and y are always cosine and sine. In the unit circle as x, the cosine, increases the versine, which is equivalent to the sine, simultaneously decreases and vice a versa.  Thus the cosine and versine act as opposites and thus the cosine acts as a negative versine.  Thus as h goes to zero, negative h, the versine, goes to 1. This eliminates any division by zero.  Indeed, h MUST go to zero in order to form a derivative. Not approach. Not get infinitesimally close but h must actually acquire a value of zero.

Well, yes &amp; no.  We CAN apply L&#39;Hospital to the definition of the derivative and we learn a tiny bit:  First re-write the RightHandSide (RHS) of the definitional equation as lim_{h--&gt;0} N(h)/D(h), where N(h) = f(h+x) - f(x) and D(h) = h.  At h = 0, the quotient becomes 0/0, so let&#39;s apply L&#39;Hospital to get: lim_{h--&gt;0} (dN/dh)/(dD/dh).  Note that dN/dh = f &#39;(h+x) and dD/dh = 1, so the definitional equation transforms to be (df/dx)(x) = f&#39;(0 + x)/1 = f &#39;(x), which is true but doesn&#39;t teach us anything new except that L&#39;Hospital&#39;s Theorem is consistent with the definition; that&#39;s not much but it&#39;s nice to see that these puzzle pieces do indeed fit together nicely.

When you make the nudge small enough, it&#39;s still a nudge away from the limiting value h, but it may as well still be that limiting value. h+\u03b5 is still essentially h at the finite scale no matter how many times you add \u03b5, but at the same time it&#39;s not h. It&#39;s h+\u03b5. It&#39;s a value larger than h, but so infinitesimally larger than h that it may as well still be h at more finite scales for the purposes of finding the derivative or integral of a function.<br><br>But in that same line of logic, if you&#39;re finding the limit of a discontinuous function that jumps between two very different values at the limiting value, h+\u03b5 and h-\u03b5 are still so close to h that they may as well be h on the macro, finite scale, but they are also NOT equal to h or equal to each other, for that matter. One is larger than h by \u03b5 while the other is smaller than h by \u03b5. And this infinitesimally small difference is enough to find the limit of the function&#39;s value AT h from the respective side defined by the addition or subtraction of \u03b5. That to me is what the superscript + or - says in limits, and that to me is what the dx says in Leibniz notation or closing off the end of an integral.<br><br>I know it&#39;s not exactly the most intuitive way to think about it, but to me it somehow makes sense to think about it from this more philosophical perspective of that tiny nudge being infinitesimally small.<br><br>And in that same breath, 1/\u221e = \u03b5 (which may as well just be 0 at the finite scale) and 1/\u03b5 (which may as well be 1/0 at the finite scale) = \u221e. Because \u03b5 is the infinitesimal number, there is no finitely small number that can possibly describe its value. It falls into the same philosophical zone as infinity. And yet, we use such obviously non-numeric concepts as infinity and the infinitesimal as if they are numbers. But they&#39;re not. And yet the math still works and answers come right out in the wash somehow.<br><br>It&#39;s a bit of philosophy that just kinda blows my mind, and I like thinking about it anytime I use \u221e or \u03b5 in my math, even if it&#39;s only implied by the notation. :)", "comment_date": "2017-11-21T02:22:06Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Ismir Eghal", "comment_text": "<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kfF40MiS7zA&amp;t=6m22s\">6:22</a> that &#39;come on&#39; is so relatable\ud83d\ude02\u2764", "comment_date": "2017-11-15T15:31:37Z", "likes_count": 51}, {"comment_by": "AVANISH K R", "comment_text": "I think its good to do this visual class for geometry", "comment_date": "2017-11-13T12:11:10Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Sudesh Regmi", "comment_text": "i want you to be more abstract than this , make math look like a language course. !!", "comment_date": "2017-11-12T15:14:00Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Kristoffer", "comment_text": "In relation to L&#39;Hopitals rule, i don&#39;t get why the function value around zero is approximately equal to the derivative around zero.
