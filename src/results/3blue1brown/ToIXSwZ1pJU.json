On the one hand, it seems like people should have thought of Fourier series earlier since it was understood at least since Pythagoras that complex musical tones are made of simple harmonics. Also it&#39;s a pretty natural idea once you&#39;ve invented Taylor series. On the other hand, studying Fourier series of the simplest of functions like f(x) = x very quickly yields the solution to the Basel problem, originally solved by Euler using a totally different method, which suggests nobody had studied them at all before Fourier himself.", "comment_date": "2019-06-17T20:11:48Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "dotan goldberg", "comment_text": "dang look at that Gibbs phenomenon at <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ToIXSwZ1pJU&amp;t=2m07s\">2:07</a> that is one cool effect <br>dang.", "comment_date": "2019-06-17T20:06:39Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "PTNLemay", "comment_text": "How can a constant offset (like say adding y=5 to shift the whole final curve up above the x axis) be created from a sinewave?
