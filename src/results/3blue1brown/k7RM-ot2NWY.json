The name \u201cIslam\u201d is chosen by God (Allah) and not by man. It is the same unifying Message revealed to all the Prophets and Messengers by Allah and which they spread amongst their respective nations. In its Final form it was revealed to Muhammad (Peace &amp; Mercy of Allah be upon him) as a complete Message to whole mankind. The Lord, Allah, is the True and Only Creator that deserves to be worshipped. No worship is worthy of being given to a stone, statue, a cross, a triangle, Khomeini, Farakhan, Eliajahs, Malcom\u2019s X or Y, Ghandi, Krishna, Guru, Buddha, Mahatma, Emperor, Joseph Smith, Sun, Moon (not to that from Korea too!), Light, Fire, rivers, cows, Rama, Temples, Prophets, Messengers (Yes! Muslims do not worship Muhammad-peace be upon him), Saints, Priests, Monks, Movie Stars, Sheiks, etc.!!! All are created beings or things.<br><br><br>ALLAH, is the Name of the One True God. His Name is not chosen by man and does not have a number or gender. It is known that Allah is the Name of God in Aramaic, the language of our beloved Prophet Jesus and a sister language of Arabic. The Name \u201cAllah\u201d has been used by all previous Prophets starting with Adam and by the last and final Prophet, Muhammad (Peace be upon them all).<br><br><br><br>The Innate Nature in man recognizes what is good and bad, what is true and false. It recognizes that the Attributes of Allah must be True, Unique, and All-Perfect. It does not feel comfortable towards any kind of degradation of His Attributes not does it qualities to the Creator. Many who became \u201cdiscontent with God\u201d did so because of the practices of the Church in medieval Europe and because of the claims of \u201cgod dwelling in a son\u201d and the concept of the \u201coriginal sin\u201d. However, they \u201cescaped\u201d into worshipping a new theory called \u201cmother nature\u201d as well as the \u201cmaterial\u201d World. With the advancement of materialistic technology others from different religions adopted the concept of \u201cforgetting about God\u201d and \u201clet us live this life and enjoy it!\u201d, not realizing that they have chosen the worship of the \u201coriginal god\u201d of Rome: Desire!.<br><br><br>NOW we can see that all of this materialistic and secular progress produced a spiritual vacuum that led to complex social, economical, political, and psychological problems. Many of those who \u201cfled\u201d their \u201creligions\u201d are in search again. Some try to \u201cescape\u201d the complexity of their daily lives via various means. Those who had the chance to examine the Qur\u2019an and Islam, proceed with a complete way of life that relates man to establish a purpose for his presence on earth. This is well recognized in the Attributes of Allah and what does He require from man. He does not want man to be enslaved to any false deity: nature, drugs, lust, money, other man, desire, or sex. He provides man with the proofs that He is the One who can redeem so that man can free himself from the slavery to any form of creation and to turn to his Creator Alone. THIS Creator Has Perfect Attributes. He is the First, nothing is before Him, the Ever Living. To Him is the Final Return where everyone will be dealt with in the Most Perfect and Just way. He does not begot nor He is begotten. Those who attribute Divinity to Jesus forget or ignore the fact that Jesus was in a mother\u2019s womb. He needed nutrition; he was born and grew up to be a man. He was trusted with the Gospel as a Message to the Children of Israel: \u201cFor there is One God, and one mediator (i.e. a messenger) between God and men (the Children of Israel), the man Christ Jesus) (I Timothy 2:5). A man-messenger calling his nation not to worship him: \u201cBut in vain they do worship me!\u201d (Mathew 15:9). A man who needs to eat, walk, sleed, rest, etc.. cannot have Divine Attributes because he is in need and God (Allah) is Self-Sufficient.<br><br><br><br>AS far as Buddhism, Hinduism, Zoroastrianism, Marxism, and Capitalism,<br><br>there is the devotion of worshipping created being/things in one form or another. Jews had attributed a \u201cNationalistic\u201d belonging to Allah. They labeled Him \u201cThe Tribal God\u201d for the Children of Israel. Men and women following these \u201creligions\u201d were born with the natural inclination of submission to their Creator, Allah. It is their parents who had driven them into their respective traditions. However, once people are exposed to the Signs of Allah around them, or in the Qur\u2019an or to someone who triggers thei Fitra (natural inclination to worship Allah Alone), the reverting process begins and that is why we see a universal spreading of Islam. In the West and despite tha many distortions of Islam in the Media, many admit that Islam may be the fastest growing Faith. No sense of fairness can be achieved without a genuine attempt to know the Word of Allah in the Qur\u2019an and not on the 30-min-Evening News. This is the real challenge for those who seek the Truth. Man is created for a purpose: to live a life in accordance with Allah\u2019s way. Why Not? Do we posses the air we breath? Did we create ourselves or others? Or were we ourselves the Creators? We are limited and weak. So is our right to ignore our Creator where we all need Him?<br><br><br><br>ISLAM is the submission in worship to Allah Alone and it is the essence of all the Messages sent to all nations before us. Allah is All-Just and All-Wise. He does not intend confusion for His Creation. The religion accepted to Him is the one chosen by Him. Its essence must be One, because He is One. It is free from geographical, racist, and status oriented concepts. It is Perfect and it is the complete way of life. All these qualities are chosen by Allah in His Only Religion: Islam. Its details are in in the Qur\u2019an, read it and come with an open heart because none can expose better than the World of Allah. The Qur\u2019an was revealed to Prophet Muhammad. He did not author it. He was unlettered. Its translation is available in many languages in bookstores or in an Islamic Center close to you. Take the time to read it and come/call the Islamic Center, or speak to someone who re-verted and submitted to Allah Alone.<br><br>Prepared by Dr. Saleh As-Saleh", "comment_date": "2022-03-21T07:14:45Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Conforzo ", "comment_text": "Why can&#39;t math always be described this intuitively?

Since you mentioned that is a good idea to think of vectors as dots, and since we have three linearly independent vectors, it would make sense that we can get all possible points within the 3D vector space since one of the requirements of a vector space is for it (the linear combination of the vectors) to have the properties of scalar addition and closed under multiplication which opens the door for an infinite way of expressing this linear combination since, in theory, we are open to all real numbers within the vector space. so we can get a sphere if we expand the numbers out from their respected origins.<br><br>I am trying to understand.", "comment_date": "2021-12-11T04:42:37Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "edsonwinnerify", "comment_text": "Gotta confess this is the 3rd or 4th time I watch thiw video and I am finally getting it.

NOTE: A and B are scalars. <br><br>It is only when the basis vectors are linearly independent meaning that in geometric space, the basis vectors don&#39;t interfere/touch each other or live inside the span of other vectors, that we are able to apply linear combinations and consequently span/reach all possible vectors in space.\u00a0<br><br>Whether the coordinate system is the xy axis or the basis vectors are in some weird coordinate system, geometrically these basis vectors should not touch each other or live on the same line or span of each other.

I can only say it is 5 steps in front of me and 3 steps to the left of me.

I am not very confident in it. But here is my answer to the quiz :  <br><br>So basis is a set of linearly independent vectors that span the full space. <br> <br>The description from the last paragraph is about basis as a set. Now, lets see the terms  here :<br><br>So a basis is a set. Just like (i, j) for the 2D vectors  / i can&#39;t include the upward point above it, so sorry hehe/. So in a vector space there can be more than 2 basis. For the example is (i, j, and k) for the 3D Vectors. <br><br>Linearly Independent :  meaning that no matter with what number we multiply the basis, it will never be the same as the other basis. meaning that it adds a diferent dimension.  <br><br>For the example is that the basis i, representing the x coordinate, no matter how we multiply it, will never be j or the y coordinate. Just like in physics, we usually seperate the x and y direction. And a vector is a set of quantity with different basis!<br><br>Span : the set of all their linear combination. Spanning the full space means that the combination of all span that can happen for multiplying different basis with differen/the same number can touch every area of the space, like what mentioned in the video. <br><br>Full Space : I am asuming that the full space is the vector space. Meaning that it is infinite.<br><br><br>I don&#39;t know if i am correct or not, so if u have feedbacks, pls reply.

As a part of my homework (not for a grade, just practice) I have to define some of the vocabulary, so I thought it would be nice to write down my definitions here. I hope this sums it up:<br><br><br>So esencialy, a linear combonation is a sum of a set of vectors that, when all added together, makes a new vector. Just adding the vectors together (without matrixes) will only alow you to see it&#39;s magnitude, but by useing matrixes, you get to see its new direction. <br><br>A Span is the area where all possible linear combinations of a given set of vectors may exist. The list (so to speak) of the possible new vectors from the linear combinations are only defined by the list of possible scalars of each vector in a linear combination where the direction of each vector in the linear combination stays the same. <br><br>A vector is linearly independant if when you exclude it from the sum of the vectors in the linear combination, the span becomes a lower dimention. A vector is linearly dependent if when you exclude it from the sum of the vectors in the linear combination, the span doesn&#39;t change. For example, if given 3 vectors, one vector makes the span one dementional, the second vector makes the span 2 dimentional (unless the2nd  vector is in the same direction as the 1st, wich would make it dependent), and the third vector makes the span 3d (unless it is within the the 2d span made by the other vetors).<br><br>A Basis is all the nesesary linearly independant vectors in a linear combination that make their Span.
