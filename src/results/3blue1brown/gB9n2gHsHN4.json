That is to say, a twodimensional plane as we understand it requires that you can describe its borders with a onedimensional object (a line) on which a set of operations is applied. To form a square, it would entail that you start off with a straight line and at any given point make it turn left or right at a 90 degree angle, then repeat this another two times to arrive back at the starting point. For a circle it would entail a series of operations relating to pi. So it basically boils down to a regularity with which a onedimensional object undergoes certain operations to form a closed system. If, in the case of the square, you would leave a single one of the operations out, you would end up with an area that shoots off to infinity. <br><br>When I look at the idealized right angled seed of the Koch curve, you could operationalise this into 6 operations:<br><br>1. Turn 90 degrees left after length x<br>2 Turn 90 degrees right after length x<br>3. Turn 90 degrees right after length x<br>4. Turn 90 degrees left after length 2x<br>5. Turn 90 degrees left after length x<br>6. Turn 90 degrees right after length x<br><br>After following these operations, the system doesn\u2019t form a closed loop however. I\u2019m guessing that when the dimension number is an integer, it always denotes a closed system, whereas any decimal number denotes an open system not \u2018circling\u2019 back on itself?", "comment_date": "2021-10-13T04:23:59Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "J J", "comment_text": "Awesome video.

With how he shows it,Each side is duplicated and then split into four. You can look and see that each side is broken into 4 sides per layer (making all of the sides broken into 4 cubes per layer) yet there are 2 layers. You should only be able to form 1 layer with cubes that large. The cube is known for having 6 sides, but he should have said that he has a 3D cube that is NOT hollow. Basically you can\u2019t make 2 layers worth of cubes because the number of layers is the same as the number of half the sides in axis. It is half because 1/2 makes the bottom of the cube and the other the top. If i included the other half, all of the miniature cubes would lose their bottoms. Basically Basically (on purpose) He should say that the cube is made of something solid with mass, that is not hollow. I saw it as the cube is hollow, as it is made of only 2d sides. Making the cube not hollow gives it a infinite number if sides stacked on top of each other in any one axis that forms all of the other sides that happen to follow the same rules as the sides that Made them. <b>realizes that according to my viewpoint, 2d shapes would be hollow too and that is NOT right.

Think about a sidewalk illusion where as you walk towards it the object appears to shrink and as you walk backwards from it, the piece of art appears to enlarge.  Lots of sidewalk art appear to break our laws of physics without actually breaking them.  By changing the space in which something rests upon you can change its meaning or in this case value.  A way to represent this is to draw two parallel lines of equal length on a latex balloon with a stick figure standing on both of them.  The balloon represents space.  As you blow the ballon up space expands accordingly with the pressures affect on the latex&#39;s elasticity thus stretching the original measurement.   The line is still true to it&#39;s space proportionally.  Since we are outside of that plane we perceive a change in the fact that the lines we drew stretched, diluted in mass, but most importantly they curved.  Now from the perspective of the stick figures nothing changed at all because they scale accordingly  with the balloon&#39;s surface at a 1:1 ratio.  All three observation viewpoints are true.  Each stick figure would measure their lines to be the same length but when we measure the lines both are longer than they were originally.

When we store things in our brain, it makes sense to compress the * out of it.

But this tendency may be the wrong approach in so many cases the implications are staggering.

But then you get sentences with their rules, placement of words and you can describe things in nature, formulars in math as the counterpart. Graphs are just a way to write it down, (you speak a sentence, if you write it down you can see every piece of it from the beginning to its end and how it conected, like the graph of a forlular) also writing is also like a language of its own, funny isn&#39;t it ? Add sentences to sentences and weave them together and you get a speech (mayby not a good word at this place, i told ya, my english isn&#39;t good enough to give it enouch credit, but it should be good enouch for the gist) that can deliver a greater meaning that non cohering sentences on their own. <br><br>Some people say: math is the language god has written the universe in.<br>I say: math is just a translation of the universe xD <br>Now i understand it, thx for that mental breakthrough.<br>Oh and something that i found out abbout my comment if i start thinking of it, isn&#39;t it just the same as one of those shapes above ? Things consisting of itself ? Oh no then it would be just a that a word would consist out of words, WAIT THEY DO! and even if you take another approach, like not just words consisting out of smaller words and sentences out of smaller ones, also words consist out of letters that are just a fraction of the word itself ! Would be interresting to see what the dimention of that would be, or just the struggle of mathematicians trying to calculate it XD. <br>Does this even make sence annymore or do i just get insane ?

Aren&#39;t we nature, too? Indeed, the difference lies not so much in whose hand does the work, but in the swiftness of that hand. Linearity is the geometry of motion, of cutting of separation. The faster the saw blade, the smoother the cut. Nature, too, has her arcs and lines: the speeding orbits of the planets, the streaming trail of a light ray, the zip of a bee to the hive. Fractal geometry, on the other hand, grows from stillness, from layer upon layer of repeated joining. When humans slow down, we create lacework, Persian rugs, Baroque furniture, and Gothic palaces. That richly woven artifacts have all but disappeared from our culture is above all a reflection of its velocity.

A dimension of 0, 1, 2, 3...are fractals, but &quot;boring fractals&quot;, they are included in the  Hausdorff Dimensions. Re-read his earlier writing and the preface to his book.\r<br>\r<br>Logarithms are defined on the ENTIRE REAL NUMBER SYSTEM; yes, they include the negative numbers and all the irrationals and transcendentals, ALL &quot;real numbers&quot;. Most math classes ignore the fact they include the negatives. Euler did not or he would never have come up with his famous identity. \r<br>\r<br>The primary purpose for studying algebraic theory is the principle if you can show a given set fulfills all requirements to be logically equivalent to another type of set, say positive whole numbers, you do not need to prove 1 unit plus 1 unit of your set equals 2 units; proving the equivalency of your set to whole positive numbers is all you need. \r<br>\r<br>All arithmetic that can be done with real numbers can be done with 2 different Mandelbrot sets. We don&#39;t have to come up with theoretical examples to know this, algebraic theory affirms it. \r<br>\r<br>An &quot;infinitely long surface&quot; of a meter of rough-cut wood becomes smoother, a lower fractal, by the subtraction of sanding. The sanding action---the making the wood&#39;s surface smoother---can be thought of as subtracting the fractal value of the sandpaper from the fractal value of the rough wood. The more sanding, the more subtracting, until the fractal for the rough wood surface approaches closer and closer to a completely smooth surface. (Gives a theoretical way to consider very rough applied a few times versus almost smooth sandpaper applied many times.) \r<br>Over-sand, you will make a hole in the surface (Zero fractal, zero dimension). \r<br>Keep sanding like a mindless robot, you go beneath the original surface: A &quot;negative surface&quot;. \r<br>\r<br>The world can be seen as interacting fractals. You can see the wind acting on sandstone, waves interacting with shore, roots working through soil, a caterpillar eating a leaf, you can see the whole universe as interacting fractals. \r<br>That is only the beginning. \r<br>Complex Numbers, the &quot;imaginaries&quot; were discovered via algebra. \r<br>Dare to create a fractal defined on complex numbers: \r<br>You will reinvent all the &quot;weird&quot; aspects of quantum mechanics, including Bell&#39;s Interconnectedness theorem and quantum entanglement.", "comment_date": "2019-02-10T17:39:15Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "GitProphet", "comment_text": "What&#39;s the dimension of the pi-creature-fractal?", "comment_date": "2019-02-08T23:19:37Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "RedHairdo", "comment_text": "But first we need to talk about parallel universes.", "comment_date": "2019-02-08T00:16:11Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "RedHairdo", "comment_text": "You are so fucking good, it&#39;s unbelievable, thank you for existing, in the conventional sense of the word (in case it could be taken any other way).", "comment_date": "2019-02-07T19:53:03Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Vasaf Easdas", "comment_text": "<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gB9n2gHsHN4&amp;t=5m49s\">5:49</a> wouldn&#39;t it take 4 such triangles, minding the gap inside of the triangle?", "comment_date": "2019-02-06T13:27:39Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "HicalebiH *", "comment_text": "<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gB9n2gHsHN4&amp;t=2m42s\">2:42</a> - WE LIVE IN A <b>4 DIMENSIONAL WORLD</b> <br><br><br><br><br><br><br>(now watch me be wrong after I put this in all caps)", "comment_date": "2019-02-06T03:21:12Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "asphyxxj", "comment_text": "What is Mandelbrot&#39; s fractal dimension?", "comment_date": "2019-02-05T20:42:26Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Rob Annal", "comment_text": "The &#39;B&#39; in Benoit B Mandelbrot stands for &#39;Benoit B Mandelbrot&#39;", "comment_date": "2019-02-05T20:40:56Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Giacomo Marchioro", "comment_text": "But to my understanding Mandelbrot, in fact, spoke about &quot;statistical self-similarity&quot; that means that their statistical properties are self-similar not their shape.", "comment_date": "2019-02-05T15:09:22Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Harshit Ralhan", "comment_text": "What is scaling up ? ?", "comment_date": "2019-02-03T12:11:47Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "eyewars", "comment_text": "<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gB9n2gHsHN4&amp;t=13m11s\">13:11</a> You missed a couple of squares :P", "comment_date": "2019-02-02T18:09:18Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "El nInO d Phoenix", "comment_text": "I confuse on how come the 1/2 L of the bigger one triangle become the smaller one triangle \ud83e\udd14", "comment_date": "2019-02-02T02:24:15Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "leeor shimhoni", "comment_text": "I wonder if I could calculate the fractal dimensions of de borglie matter wave, and what is its relation to planks constant. <br>I wonder if space time creveture has fractal dimension.<br>I wonder if schrodinger wave function has fractal dimension, and what is its relation to planks constant.<br>wonder if space time itself has a dynamic fractal dimensions. <br>wonder if fractal dimensions could explain some quantum mechanics   phenomenons.", "comment_date": "2019-02-01T19:09:31Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "2funky4u", "comment_text": "Is there a Name of the first Methode to find out the fractal Dimension?", "comment_date": "2019-02-01T18:59:06Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "OGER ETLA", "comment_text": "Hey yeah sorry no technical talent here", "comment_date": "2019-02-01T06:49:21Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Noa", "comment_text": "<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gB9n2gHsHN4&amp;t=10m35s\">10:35</a> <br>3Blue1Brown: &quot;How many boxes have you TOUCHED?&quot; &quot;69&quot; <br>Every Clickbait Channel: MATHEMATICS GONE SEXUAL!!!

Well, blame Youtube.  Nice video, and while I get the leap of logic you made, the assumption is in the wrong realm of reasoning.  Dimensions in the way we reference them has little to do with the construct itself, but with one existing plane in which it is reasonable to discuss its area.  So take for example a triangle and a circle, which are obviously living in a 2D plane, versus a pyramid or a sphere, which,--well you get the jest.  Now, if I wanted to &quot;scale&quot; the circle using the logic you did and find it&#39;s value D, exactly, how would I go about that?  I can break a circle into what exact unit of &quot;similar&quot; parts?  Well, to even bother with this, you would need to define the object explicitly and then make the connection.  Basically, a circle is defined in the same set of objects as a triangle and a square if they share one line value from the center, ergo a radius.  Since their definition all share the same reference of the line we start to build relationships that way.  Well then, how do things that are not therefore squares separate in to &quot;equal&quot; parts?  They don&#39;t.  And why they fail such a rendition is clearly explained in geometry, ergo, these other objects, the right triangle and the circle specifically, have irrational components to start with and cannot every be easily divisible rationally.   But not to fear, we can still get a nice measurement of them, as you so aptly indicate as the goal of math to begin with being measuring, by involving their irrationality and inscribing them into an object that itself is not irrational and is why it can be evenly divided up, and we can get an approximation of the area of these other shapes used up when inscribed in a square.  Your choice of shapes actually disguises this folly.  But let me be clear, all existing math is done between things that are closely related such that by COMPARING them we see a pattern that they all seem to obey.  This establishes the rule set that OPERATES on the objects property.  For numbers, that property is VALUE.  For geometric shapes, those properties are the points and the lines where a line exist as the distance between two points.  Now, I yes I know we use geometry to mess around with, and even define values like PI, so I am not saying we do not bridge borders; I am saying we never actually redefine their properties to get them to fit with a system of logic that suits us.  If we could frivolously do so, we&#39;d all make Star Trek or Starwars universe where such things as &quot;warp drives&quot; could treat space like an ocean even though space doesn&#39;t in anyway share the same properties as matter.....", "comment_date": "2018-11-13T13:07:03Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Cole Bertrand", "comment_text": "Question: How would you go about recording the coordinates of a point in a non-integer dimension?

What I mean to say is that 10 should rightly be the first number of the second iteration and not the last number of the first iteration but the way we count sort of naturally puts ten at the end of the first iteration - in that base10 system.

One question though...<br><br>I like the mass analogy when dealing with a truly &quot;infinite&quot; fractal like the Sierpinski triangle, but it seems like this analogy would fail if applied to any objects in the real world. <br><br>For example, let&#39;s say we approximate a Sierpinski triangle out of a wire of some thin but finite thickness. Due to physical constraints, we will have to &quot;cut off&quot; our Sierpinksi triangle at a certain point -- say, after ~10,000 iterations of bending the wire into smaller and smaller triangles.<br><br>We may think, well, since this pseudo-Sierpinksi triangle looks almost exactly like a true Sierpinski triangle (to within 10,000 levels of &quot;zoom&quot;), its mass should scale similarly to that of a true Sierpinski triangle. <br><br>But that logic would be completely incorrect, right?<br><br>A true Sierpinski triangle, if scaled up by a factor of 2, would have its mass increase by a factor of 3. However -- in reality -- if were to make a scaled up version of our pseudo-Sierpinksi triangle (by using the same-thickness wire as before, but making a new 10,000-iteration triangle with edges twice the size), its mass would <b>not</b> increase by a factor of 3. Instead, if we were to place this new triangle on a sufficiently accurate mass balance, we would find that it weighs exactly twice as much -- not 3 times as much -- as the original.<br><br>Right?

Another example would be infinite sums. We may invent the shorthand symbols for that operation, but the results are not &quot;made up&quot; before hand, they are calculated via telescoping or exploiting geometric progression. There are simpler examples, like that the two short side angles of a right triangle sum to get the third. Is this not just a bi-product of the postulates of Euclidean geometry?

As you showed in the video the graph of the touched squares would be irregular at first but then start to form a line as the resoluion of the grid increases. But  our map is not a fractal but a 1D line. If the resolution approached infinity you would measure a dimension of 1 with the method. So the graph is not actually noisy data that starts to form a line but a curve. it has to bend to get a slope of 1 at some point. So the grid resolution interval covered has an impact on the dimension measurement. That&#39;s why I think the condition that the dimension is at the limit is very important.", "comment_date": "2017-01-27T18:02:43Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "TomRaj", "comment_text": "I wonder what the fractal dimension would be of the Weierstrass function...", "comment_date": "2017-01-27T18:01:52Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Vishwas", "comment_text": "Waiting for a calculus series", "comment_date": "2017-01-27T18:01:18Z", "likes_count": 285}, {"comment_by": "Thyderion", "comment_text": "The reason I subscribed to your channel was the &quot;Triangle of Power&quot; video that you produced.\u00a0 But when you have an opportunity to utilize this concept in a real application, you go back to the archaic &quot;log&quot; to determine &quot;D&quot;.", "comment_date": "2017-01-27T17:59:58Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Sammy Saperstein", "comment_text": "at what point in math do you start learning about fractals more rigorously?", "comment_date": "2017-01-27T17:59:45Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Niklas Halonen", "comment_text": "wow markus persson is one of your patreons", "comment_date": "2017-01-27T17:56:54Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Levythan", "comment_text": "This is the best education channel on YouTube", "comment_date": "2017-01-27T17:56:31Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Guy Edwards", "comment_text": "I was wondering what would happen if you defined a fractal shape whose dimension kept oscillating around different values as you increased the resolution of the box counter instead of converging to one number eventually.
