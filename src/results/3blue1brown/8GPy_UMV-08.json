If we take the infinite product as (2/1 \u00d7 2/3) \u00d7 (4/3 \u00d7 4/5) \u00d7 (6/5 \u00d76/7)\u2026 instead we see that it becomes 4/3 \u00d7 16/15 \u00d7 36/35\u2026, or the infinite product of 4n\u00b2/(4n\u00b2 - 1) for all natural numbers n. But 4n\u00b2/(4n\u00b2-1) is always going to be ever so slightly bigger than 1 so we should expect the Wallis product to approach infinity, except it doesn&#39;t. Looking at the product this way is like looking only at every second point in the graph at <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8GPy_UMV-08&amp;t=2m51s\">2:51</a>, which does appear to approach infinity. I have a feeling that this is related to dominated convergence (the website says that the lesson couldn&#39;t be found?), but I also noticed that it&#39;s the same as the sequence in <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8GPy_UMV-08&amp;t=2m06s\">2:06</a> but n is squared. I suspect the \u00b2 might be causing all the difference (for eg the sum of the inverses of all natural numbers has no limit, but the sum of the inverse squares of all natural numbers is pi\u00b2/6).

In the video, it was shown that, letting epsilon &gt; 0, for all i, there exists an M such that N &gt; M implies the difference between length of the chord and the arc length is less than epsilon, for all j &lt;= i. This fact is true! Cool! Now in computing the limit of the product, it seems as though 3B1B, in explaining the intuition, has sneakily switched the order of the quantifiers, and basically said that there exists an M such that for all j, N &gt; M implies that the difference between any chord length and corresponding arc length is less than epsilon. This fact is blatantly false! I know that this switching of quantifiers just looks like commuting limits, which they discuss, but that doesn&#39;t change the fact that this statement, as implied in the video is simply false. The geometry of a circle does not change, so you always have the fact that as N increases there will still be WAY more points for which this version of the small angle approximation does not hold. Just think about any distance far across the circle. Sure, if you track the same index, it approaches the observers, but as you bring that point inside the small angle approximation circle, you are also creating at least one point opposite the observers to which you just cannot apply the small angle approximation. And what about that multitude of points in between, where the ratio is neither close to 1 nor close to the limit?

You actually highlighted this by increasing the number of lighthouses and bringing the Sailor closer to the line of sight of all the lighthouses.However, that assumption cannot hold when we are at the opposite side of the circle (e.g. the lighthouse L4 at <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8GPy_UMV-08&amp;t=15m15s\">15:15</a>) since the Sailor is not in the line of sight. Clearly, as we travel the circle around to the opposite side, the fraction supposed to give the Wallis product changes in a totally different manner. Now, of course we can increase the number of lighthouses as much as we want and obtain more and more of the terms while still keeping the Sailor in the line of sight (and the subsequent more inaccurate terms will have a negligible effect since they approach 1 very quickly), but since the complex number calculation takes into account whole of the circle, I think addressing this issue is relevant for rigor.", "comment_date": "2019-04-22T18:17:49Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Adam Sniffen", "comment_text": "Well it exactly a year to the day since this video came out.

Congratulations.  But there was one step in the derivation/proof that is, at best, non-obvious and deserves some clarification (at least to me!).  It is the statement about the ratio of the distances between L0 and Ln and L0 and Ln+1.  In the limit of large number of point, the relevant Ls get closer to L0 and the distances seem along a line, so the ratios as given are apparent.  BUT what about the Ls on the other side of the circle?  In this case, the linear &quot;approximation&quot; or graphical representation no longer holds.

For example, just as our previous video on 1 + \u00bc + 1/9  + \u2026 was based on a paper by Johan W\u00e4stlund clearly showing the connection between that sum and circles, there is also a beautiful paper by W\u00e4stlund showing a connection between the Wallis product and circles via a different approach than we\u2019ve taken here, which you may find interesting. Donald Knuth has also put out descriptions building off this work by W\u00e4stlund. You can check both of those out in the links below. And of course there\u2019s Wallis\u2019s original 17th century argument, based on analysis of certain integrals, though this can make the connection to circles hard to see directly. <br><br>But, naturally, we\u2019re fondest of the proof we ended up giving here, for its simplicity, for the directions in which it generalizes, and, hell, for the opportunity to re-use our lighthouse animations. And we hope you enjoyed it too.<br><br>*Edit*: It looks like some people are asking about why the segment at <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8GPy_UMV-08&amp;t=12m33s\">12:33</a> is okay, given that it feels like taking 0/0.  Keep in mind, the actual goal at that spot is to find a polynomial whose roots are L_1, L_2, ... L_{N-1}, so the concrete result being stated is that (x - L_1)(x - L_2)...(x - L_{N-1}) will expand out to become 1+x+x^2+....x^{N-1}.  No division by zero issues there.  Sure, plugging in x=1 to (x^N - 1)/(x - 1) is undefined (at least before explicitly stating the intention to extend the function via a limit), but the reason for doing that polynomial division was just to see how (x - L_1)(x - L_2)...(x - L_{N-1}) would expand.  All that division is asking is (x - 1)(...what?...) = (x^N - 1).<br><br>Here, to give a really simple example, it&#39;s like saying x^2 - 1 has roots at 1 and -1, so dividing it by (x - 1) gives a polynomial with just a root at -1, namely (x^2 - 1) / (x - 1) = x + 1.  &quot;But wait!&quot;, someone could say, &quot;you can&#39;t plug x = 1 into that fraction!&quot;.  For sure for sure dude, but that doesn&#39;t change the fact that x + 1 is legitimately a polynomial which just has -1 as a root.  Maybe you justify that division by saying something about limits, or about analytic continuation, or just by reframing to say what you care about is the question (x - 1)(...what?...) = x^2 - 1, but that&#39;s all kind of beside the point.<br><br>Also, many of you are asking &quot;Isn&#39;t the &#39;distance is proportional to angle&#39; approximation only valid for lighthouses near the observers? What about all the lighthouses on the far end of the circle?&quot;. The key is that the product we are ultimately interested in is made up of the asymptotic contributions of each particular lighthouse (in the sense of, e.g., &quot;The 53rd lighthouse after the keeper&quot;), in the limit as N goes to infinity. Whatever particular lighthouse you are looking at, in that limit as N goes to infinity, it will be bunched right next to the observers, and so distances will be proportional to angles for computing its asymptotic contribution.<br><br>As noted in the section on formalities, Dominated Convergence then rigorously assures us that it&#39;s ok to equate &quot;The product of each particular lighthouse&#39;s asymptotic limit contribution&quot; (which is the product we&#39;re interested in: the Wallis product, or sine product more generally) with &quot;The asymptotic limit of the product of the contributions from each particular lighthouse&quot; (which is the asymptotic limit of the products we have an easy time calculating: the distance-products our lemmas directly address). For more technical details on this use of Dominated Convergence, see the supplemental blogpost.<br><br>Our supplemental blogpost:<br><a href=\"https://www.3blue1brown.com/sridhars-corner/2018/4/17/wallis-product-supplement-dominated-convergence\">https://www.3blue1brown.com/sridhars-corner/2018/4/17/wallis-product-supplement-dominated-convergence</a><br><br>Another cool way of approaching the Wallis product:<br><a href=\"http://www.math.chalmers.se/~wastlund/monthly.pdf\">http://www.math.chalmers.se/~wastlund/monthly.pdf</a><br><a href=\"https://apetresc.wordpress.com/2010/12/28/knuths-why-pi-talk-at-stanford-part-1/\">https://apetresc.wordpress.com/2010/12/28/knuths-why-pi-talk-at-stanford-part-1/</a>", "comment_date": "2018-04-20T19:01:06Z", "likes_count": 559}, {"comment_by": "Hue Gass", "comment_text": "I\u2019m a simple man, I see 3B1B, I click like.", "comment_date": "2018-04-20T19:00:58Z", "likes_count": 300}, {"comment_by": "Ju\u0161 Mirti\u010d", "comment_text": "Great Viedo (watched the unlised one), just thought I&#39;l let you know you did a great job, as per usual.
