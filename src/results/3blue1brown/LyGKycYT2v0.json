Once again thank you for your excellent linear algebra tutorial. However, i don&#39;t agree with this interpretation. It is not coherent with other manipulations, like matrix - matrix multiplication, and doesn&#39;t explain clearly what it is the result we get. Let me share my explanation of what dot product actually is. Dot product is a special case of matrix-matrix multiplication, that translates a vector to 1-dimensional space. If we multiply w and v, then the result is orientation and magnitude of projection of the vector w on vector v expressed in units of this new space. The implication of this understanding is very broad - it better explains and makes coherent other concepts, like null spaces, determinants, asf. It makes also the way how dot product is calculated immediately obvious. Let&#39;s try this, please. As it was said, matrix multiplication changes orientation and length of unit vectors. On the example of this video, try to project i-hat and j-hat onto second vectors. Specify the unit vector as equal to projection of j-hat and 1/3 of i-hat. And now, observe, what is the magnitude of projection of w on v expressed in units of v, and how you would calculate it without knowing, how to perform dot product. It is self-explanatory, do you agree? The missing part is base unit of this new dimension. If we get it, then everything is very simple. Also, i said, that dot product is a special case of matrix multiplication. If we understand matrix multiplication as switching from one space defined by some set of coordinates to another space defined by another set of coordinates, then this is obvious, that what we need is a series of dot products in order to project coordinates from first space to coordinates of second space. Another implication, that simplifies a lot, is that by any transformation the observed object, f.i. a vector, doesn&#39;t change. The way we perceive the object in new space changes, the object is still the same. And this is coherent with the observation from real world. Let&#39;s say, that we observe two trees. If we come closer to the trees, they don&#39;t become bigger, but their magnitude in our new point of observation. When we come closer and we specify our distance to the trees as the same number of units, then those units becomes smaller, and the height of the trees expressed in those new units is bigger. If we change the angle of observation, then we change the projection of distance between the trees projected on the coordinate that is perpendicular to our direction to the trees, but the real distance between the trees stays the same. If we stay in line with the trees, we are able to see only the first tree, the second tree and all trees that are inline land in null space. We can&#39;t see them, but it doesn&#39;t mean, that they doesn&#39;t exist. We can also try something else. Let&#39;s take a pen, keep it in hand and close your one eye. Then, keep the pen in the same place, but move you head and watch the pen from different angles and from different distances. The pen is all the time the same, but it&#39;s perceived orientation and length changes. This is what we get performing dot product.", "comment_date": "2022-02-12T10:36:10Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Zuko Fire", "comment_text": "Thanks for this!

It can be thought of as two basis vectors on the same number line that can be scaled to any magnitude or direction in order to end up at a specific point on said number line.<br><br>Or, the way that seemed way less intuitive to me at first, the &quot;projection&quot;. At first, I couldn&#39;t understand what this one meant because it didn&#39;t seem to make sense. It seemed like, in order to project one vector onto another vector, there had to be some trigonometry involved which didn&#39;t make sense given that the formula was, simply, multiply and add. To me, this way of thinking of the dot product is less of a projection and more of a way to describe the &quot;movement&quot; of a vector in any given direction relative to another vector.<br><br>So if you have a vector V = [3, 2] and W = [1, 0]. The dot product of the two would be 3. This is because V &quot;moves&quot; in the direction of W with a magnitude of 3. If you have a vector U = [0, 1], V &quot;moves&quot; by a magnitude of 2, relative to U. You can create a circle of vectors with a radius of 1 that extends out from the origin and each of those can be used to describe the &quot;magnitude&quot; of the movement of V in any given direction relative to one of those vectors. The thing is, all of these vectors are equal to 1, so for any other vector, besides describing the movement of V in the direction of said vector, this &quot;magnitude&quot; is also going to be scaled by some amount, and this change is described by the dot product formula.<br><br>This was just my way of conceptualizing it and coming to understand what was meant by &quot;projection&quot;.

Your summary was really good, and I suggest anyone who is having difficulties to understand this topic to read it. Though, I was still struggling about one specific point, which I could eventually clarify. I am writting this with the hope it might help in case anyone would have the same difficulty.<br><br>Here is the part of his message I&#39;d like to detail : &quot;Note that ANY vector, v, in the original 2D space is a linear combination of the basis vectors i-hat and j-hat. After the transformation, this still holds true: v = c1 i-hat + c2 j-hat and L(v) = c1 L(i-hat) + c2 L(j-hat). So, because L(i-hat) and L(j-hat) are projections of i-hat and j-hat, L(v) is a projection of v onto the number line!<br><br>At first, I had difficulties to see the very last assumption as a direct obvious fact, but here is why we can indeed assume that this is true:<br><br>What is important to emphazise here  is the property in wich a linear transformation (and orthogonal projection is a linear transformation) of  a linear combinaison of components is equal to the linear combination of the transformations of those same components.  That property can be visualised as : &quot;scaling and adding somme components then applying a transformation to the result is the same as transforming some component, then scaling and adding them&quot;. <br><br>Here, we call our linear transformation L, this transformation being the orthogonal projection on the line. On the other hand, v is any vector expressed (as we always can) as a linear combinaison of the basis vectors i-hat and j-hat, let&#39;s write:  v= c1*i-hat + c2*j-hat<br><br>So with that in mind, it is correct to say that L(v) =  L(c1*i-hat + c2*j-hat) (the projection of v on the line) is the same as  c1*L(i-hat) + c2*L(j-hat) (the sum of the projections of i-hat scaled by c1 and j-hat scaled by c2 on the line)<br><br>So indeed, the whole reasoning is clicking well !", "comment_date": "2021-11-20T10:08:20Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "spherinder", "comment_text": "How do you explain distributivity of the dot product geometrically?

But translation changes origins and you&#39;re not allowed to do that.   So, I was trying to figure out how matrices in computer graphics encode translation.<br><br>Then I realised that in 2D games I often see 3x3 matrices used to manipulate 2D space <i>(and 4x4 matrices to manipulate a 3D space)</i>  and the only reason I could think of is to maybe avoid breaking the fixed-origin when translating.<br><br>I started off by assuming that the extra degree of freedom relates to a &quot;translation&quot; trick - as we have to preserve the origin at [0,0] and thus 2D translation seems impossible.  So, I started thinking of how one might manage a 1D translation of the origin in a 2D space, and it kinda looked a lot like skew.<br><br>So, taking that idea into 2D, I imagined a second plane with a Z of -1.  In Z=0, the apparent XY origin can remain [0,0] or [0,0,0] ... but with a little skew, the 2D grid can be projected onto the parallel xy plane of Z=-1 letting me project the origin wherever I like, without changing the fact that the true origin for the system is still at [0,0,0].  I sort of imagine the translation as a parallel light, shining through the (x,y) grid and projecting everything onto a plane 1-unit below... a new &#39;xy plane&#39; WITH TRANSLATION, found at z=-1<br><br>Is that how 2D engines manage translation?  Or, am I overcomplicating this?<br><br>Can we cheat, and change the origin ... without ever really changing the origin, by using a projection to a new space, offset by 1 unit perpendicular to the base axes?<br><br>That make sense?<br><br>Sort of feels like using an additional degree of freedom to avoid gimbal lock... I seem to remember that being one benefit of using quaternions to express a rotation in x,y,z,w rather than just in x,y,z... to avoid it breaking under some conditions.<br><br>... seems, adding an imaginary &#39;w&#39; axis to &#39;xyz&#39; would do a similar thing for describing translation operations in a 3D space, just as adding a pretend &#39;z&#39; seems to let me fake a translation in a 2D space.<br><br>Then I thought... Is this a really common feature in math?  Adding an imaginary axis to overcome some limitation?  And... is THAT the same favour that complex numbers do for scalars?  Cus, if so... I might suddenly have intuited just why complex numbers might exist  : O<br><br>... either that, or should I book myself in for a brain scan, urgently.

Obviously this value compared to itself is equal to 1, and so indicates complete cooperation if we are speaking in terms of gradient ratios, or instead of 1 2pi could be used if we are speaking in terms angles (to me using 1 makes more sense in this scenario). When we move away from parallel we reduce the cooperation and so that number moves away from 1 towards the maximum of negative one, opposition.<br><br>I&#39;ve reasoned that this is a tool for determining the degree of cooperation, and not necessarily determining the magnitude that results from the cooperation because if we were to take the dot product of two equal vectors it would be equivalent to taking to dot product of one vector against itself, if we used the dot product to calculate combined magnitude we would get the same magnitude for 2 equal overlapping vectors as we would get for 1 vector, this is not right. I was advised that the square root of a dot product of a vector against itself is the magnitude of the vector, this makes sense as the magnitude of a vector c = (a^2 + b^2)sqrt  (c^2 = a^2 + b^2; a pretty well known  equation for calculating the longest side of a right angle triangle).<br><br>In summary my understanding is that the dot product is used to calculate some sort of cooperation number between the vectors, the direction of the cooperation can be applied to the direction of either vector; for a moment I thought it was applied at the line of symmetry, if but if that were the case then the fact that perpendicular vectors have a dot product of 0 would suggest that each vector, if projected on to the line of symmetry, would have a magnitude of 0, this is not right. I think the dot product of two vectors, divided by max possible doc product (dot product of those vectors at parallel) allows one to get a cooperation number, c. When you have a vector v projected on to a vector w, you can use to cooperation number to determine the square of the magnitude of resultant magnitude of v, c*magnitude of v.<br><br>c*v when the vectors are parallel = magnitude of v, when perpendicular = 0, when parallel but opposite = (-)magnitude of v.<br><br>Please correct me if I&#39;m wrong.<br><br><br>A quick example.<br><br>Take vector v (5,5) and vector w (5, 5) the maximum dot product is 50 now if vector w has it&#39;s tip at (5, 0). The dot product is 5*5 + 5*0 = 25.  The cooperation number, <br>is 25/50 = 0.5.<br><br>So if v is projected on to w, it should have a magnitude of (50*0.5(that is the number determined above))sqrt. Doing the test, the square of the magnitude of v at the new coordinate  = 5*5 + 0*0 = 25.", "comment_date": "2020-12-11T11:45:52Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Irineu Lopes Palhares Junior", "comment_text": "Very cool interpretation, thank you so much to share this with us!", "comment_date": "2020-12-07T14:34:05Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Jason Wilkening", "comment_text": "I can honestly say that I&#39;ve learned more in a single one of these videos than I have in my entire linear algebra course (no offense Dr. Jeter).

Through the process of measurement, the pixel is projected on each of the sensor vectors (dot product) and create 3 numbers which are the RGB values.", "comment_date": "2020-11-27T14:54:38Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Abdoh Ash", "comment_text": "Why then is the &quot;dot product&quot; result defined as a scalar and not a vector?", "comment_date": "2020-11-26T06:06:34Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "khalid", "comment_text": "math is difficult", "comment_date": "2020-11-25T19:27:00Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Ravi Dayabhai", "comment_text": "4+ years later...still my favorite video on YouTube.", "comment_date": "2020-11-25T00:00:31Z", "likes_count": 2}, {"comment_by": "Cameron Spalding", "comment_text": "In Oxford: dot products come in pretty late", "comment_date": "2020-11-22T10:52:18Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "vikramaadhithya", "comment_text": "3blue1brown, Your channell will greatly accelerate progress of science and evolution of Humanity\ud83d\ude4f\ud83d\ude4f\ud83d\ude4f\ud83d\ude4f\ud83d\ude4f\ud83d\ude4f\ud83d\ude4f\ud83d\ude4f \ud83d\ude4fmust see videos for all old and new students to get a REAL understanding of Mathematics\u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f", "comment_date": "2020-11-21T15:38:52Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Will Henry Gates", "comment_text": "Cool, but why does this math exist?

He explained why earlier, from <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyGKycYT2v0&amp;t=5m21s\">5:21</a> to <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyGKycYT2v0&amp;t=6m18s\">6:18</a>. To add on to what 3b1b said, knowing where I-hat and J-hat lands in the new number line allows us to define ALL vectors that exist in the 2-D space just as they are in the form a * I-hat + b * J-hat. Suppose L(V)  is the function to transform a given vector V onto the new number line, where V is a 2-D vector of the form a * I-hat + J-hat. Let L(I-hat) and L(J-hat) be where the I-hat and J-hat lands on the new number line respectively. Thus, L(V) = a * L(I-hat) + b * L(J-hat). a and b are given from vector V. If we can find what L(I-hat) and L(J-hat) are, then we know L(V) is possible.<br><br><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyGKycYT2v0&amp;t=8m59s\">8:59</a> || 3b1b explains to us that an arbitrary U-hat (with length equal to the lengths of I-hat and J-hat) with an x-component of Ux and y-component of Uy, has L(I-hat) and L(J-hat) as its x-component  and y-component respectively. This proof can only work if U-hat has the same length as the lengths of I-hat and J-hat. Suppose otherwise, then the line of symmetry would no longer exist and the proof no longer exists.<br><br><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyGKycYT2v0&amp;t=10m07s\">10:07</a> || 3b1b shows us where the dot product comes in.<br><br>At this point, 3b1b has shown us the dot product between U-hat and another vector, say, V, is really just V projected onto the number line that U-hat sits on. We are meant to prove for two  vectors, say V and W, and not one of them with an arbitrary unit vector. At <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyGKycYT2v0&amp;t=10m33s\">10:33</a>, 3b1b tackles this by considering projections onto non-unit vectors, i.e,  projecting V on W or vice versa.<br><br>He said that we should scale up the U-hat by a factor. In his example, he used 3. This took me a while to understand, but I think I finally got it. I don&#39;t think he explicitly stated this, but the new number line with U-hat, should lie on one of the vector you are trying to project on. Let&#39;s say that we want to project vector W on vector V, then the new number line should be on vector V. We need to use a unit vector, in this case U-hat, for this to work. This was explained in <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyGKycYT2v0&amp;t=8m59s\">8:59</a>, I have written about it above as well.<br><br>Now, we have a projection of vector W on unit vector U-hat. However, we want the projection of vector W on vector V, and not its unit vector. This is where the scaling is necessary. Since U-hat is a unit vector of the number line that vector V sits on, that would mean that vector V is a multiple of U-hat. We know this is true because they are perfectly coincident, i.e, they share the same gradient and points. Now that we know that vector V is a multiple of U-hat, how much do we need to scale U-hat by to get vector V? The answer is just the length of vector V divided by the length of U-hat. It is like when a * b = c, and you know a and c, and b is the scaling factor, then you can divide a from both sides to get b = c / a. Recall that the length of U-hat is the same as the length of I-hat and J-hat. I-hat and J-hat both have a length of one, therefore, U-hat also has a length of one. Thus, we need to scale U-hat by the length of vector V divided by one, i.e length of vector V.<br><br>For the dot product, I am going to be using the asterisk (*). So A * B is the dot product between A and B.<br><br>Currently, we have (U-hat) * (vector W), or [Ux Uy] [A B] (A and B are meant to be on top of each other, A and B are arbitrary letters that I have picked to represent the x and y components of vector W respectively). Scaling up U-hat by length of vector V (denoted by |V|), |V| x (U-hat) * vector W. This becomes |V|(Ux x A + Uy x B) = |V| x Ux x A + |V| x Uy x B. Let C and D be the x and y components of vector V respectively. C = |V| x Ux and D = |V| x Uy. Finally, we have AC + BD, which is the outcome of vector V * vector W.<br><br>The new number line can be placed on vector V instead, and by the same arguments, we should have the same results.<br><br>To summarise, (1) get U-hat and place it on one of the vectors, say V. (2) Project other vector onto U-hat, so that it is projected onto the new number line. (3) Scale U-hat up to get the original vector V.

All he is trying to give is the intuition about why you&#39;d consider dot product as projection of one vector into another.

Bcz all his force magnitude will absolutely add up to yours. <br><br>Otherwise, atleast, the lesser the angle \u00f8 between the forces, the higher the total magnitude will be. <br>But if your friends rope (force) direction is making some angle, \u00f8 with yours, then though he&#39;s putting some X amount of absolute Force, only a fraction of X (projection of your friend&#39;s on yours) will add up to yours. <br><br>If your friend makes an angle 90 degree with yours, i.e. he is pulling in perpendicular, then he&#39;s not adding up anything to your effort, cos(90)=0. <br><br>But if your friend is pulling the rope in opposite direction, cos(180)=-1==&gt;Means your friend is working against you.

But I think it&#39;s worth breaking it down into the successive application of projecting onto u-hat (which you already describe is the linear transformation given by [ u_x u_y ]), and then applying the transformation of scaling that resulting line by 3. When you focus on that last part, you can ask the same question we&#39;ve been asking the whole time when dealing with linear transformations: what happens to the unit vector basis of our coordinate system? That is, what happens to u-hat? Well, it&#39;s clear that if the transformation is simply a stretching of a factor of 3, then u-hat (a unit vector) must go to 3. That means that we can write our second linear transformation as the one-by-one matrix that just represents the one-dimensional number that our one-dimensional unit vector ends up at: [ 3 ]. So, our full project-and-stretch linear transformation can be written as the successive application of the projection matrix [ u_x u_y ] and our stretching matrix [ 3 ], which (happy day!) gives us the same result [ 3u_x 3u_y ]! And this way we get to approach the same problem but using the composition of two linear transformations that you already beautifully defined!<br><br><br>Edit: My only problem with what I just said is it feels like I have to go FROM treating u-hat as just the unit vector in two-dimensional space that happens to lie on the line we&#39;re projecting to, TO treating u-hat as the new one-dimensional basis vector of our new coordinate space.

The basis vectors i-hat and j-hat define the 2D coordinate system. The coordinates ux and uy are projections of u-hat onto the x-axis and y-axis respectively. <br><br>Say you want to transform this 2D space into the 1D number line, such that L(i-hat) and L(j-hat) are projections of i-hat and j-hat onto the number line. You&#39;ll need a 1x2 matrix that will look like [L(i-hat) L(j-hat)]. As I wrote earlier, ux and uy are projections of u-hat onto the x-axis (i-hat) and y-axis (j-hat). Because of symmetry, the projections of i-hat and j-hat onto u-hat (the number line) will also be ux and uy. So, L(i-hat) = ux, L(j-hat) = uy!

Basically, the dot product of two vectors v and u, v \u2022 u = |v|  \u2022 |u| \u2022 cos \u03b1, where \u03b1 is the angle between the 2 vectors. The algebraic definition can then be demonstrated starting from the geometric definition in this way. (There is a general demonstration for \u211d\u207f, but I will show it for \u211d\u00b2 for simplicity). Let v = v\u2093 \u00ee + v\u1d67 \u0135 and u = u\u2093 \u00ee + u\u1d67 \u0135. Imagine projecting v on to u (Just as another point for intuition about projecting, then I&#39;ll go back to the proof). The projection&#39;s length is equal to |v| cos \u03b1.  Now, u \u2022 v = (v\u2093 \u00ee + v\u1d67 \u0135)(u\u2093 \u00ee + u\u1d67 \u0135) = (v\u2093 \u00ee \u2022 u\u2093 \u00ee )+ (v\u2093 \u00ee \u2022 u\u1d67 \u0135) + (v\u1d67 \u0135 \u2022 u\u2093 \u00ee) +  (v\u1d67 \u0135 \u2022 u\u1d67 \u0135). On one hand \u00ee \u2022 \u00ee, by the geometric definition is equal to 1 \u2022 1 \u2022 cos 0 (which is 1) = 1. Same for \u0135 \u2022 \u0135 = 1. On the other hand, \u00ee \u2022 \u0135 = 1 \u2022 1 \u2022 cos 90\u00b0 (which is 0) = 0.

After I finished the demonstration on my notebook, the thing from this video that didn&#39;t serve my intuition (because on my mind it contradicted a concept from linear transformations, but this is only in my mind, in the minds of others this video probably works fine) is that the result, the right side of the equation in a linear transformation gives you the new values of x, y, z, etc, inside your initial basis (commonly (and in my case) the base i, j, k hat) for example, if you want to know where (x, y) is located on a new coordinate system, lets say that your transformation matrix gives you that x_new = 3*x - 4*y, and y_new = x + 2*y, you put x_new and y_new on the INITIAl basis, not on the new coordinate system (on the new coordinate system x_new = x and y_new = y, there is no change)... so, my mental beef with this video is that the homie Grant Sanderson (that&#39;s the homie who owns the channel and gives the voice in the videos, in case you didn&#39;t know) says (correctly) that the dot product is like projecting vectors not over the initial basis, but over the vectors themselves, unlike in linear transformations, where the new variables are given on the initial basis, so that&#39;s why I couldn&#39;t understand it, but in the demonstration it turns out that you can see it also as a projection over the initial basis, in reality it doesn&#39;t matter because dot product always projects over one dimension, and for this single dimension you can use the initial basis or any line (I use the x axis as that would be the initial basis in which results are read in a linear transformation) but the distances are the same if you put the real line on an angle.... so, TLDR, this video is pure epicness.", "comment_date": "2017-09-17T22:46:20Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Saptarshi Mitra", "comment_text": "This is so unfair.
