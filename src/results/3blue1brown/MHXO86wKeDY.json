Hence the square root of 5 divided by 2 and +/- 1/2  give the GR and it&#39;s conjugate.

The derivation applies to all integers prime or composite so are infinite in number.<br>[2] The quadratics in [1] give rise to a 2nd infinite series, again 1 for every integer, in which both roots are obtained directly without recourse to the quadratic equation and  combine to form the equation. They are the primitive quadratics for [1].<br>[3] Quadratic and linear equations litter a derived number field for the integers, some of which link to other quadratic number fields.<br>[4] Infinitely many random quadratics are associated with the partition of the integers.<br>[5] For any sequence of numbers I might encounter during my dabbling&#39;s I always look at the differences between numbers in the sequence and invariably find that they belong to a quadratic equation.<br>Since quadratics are intimately linked to the Pythagoras equation it is a good indicator as to why the differential calculus is such a powerful mathematical tool.<br>[6] I am currently currently engaged in what for me are the most intriguing quadratic sets of them all and that is those associated with Fermat&#39;s sums of two squares which after all is just the Pythagoras equation as we can always take the square root of the answer.<br>What really intrigues is that we take a single quadratic equation and use the output from a second  quadratic equation as the constant term in the first one thereby generating an infinite set of equations that output the totality of every possible sum of two squares.<br>It makes a nonsense of the conjecture that a 4n+1 prime might exist that is not a sum of two squares and requiring futile abstract  proofs or pretentious &#39;Windmill&#39; graphics to disprove it.", "comment_date": "2020-06-10T11:42:00Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Priscilla H", "comment_text": "This is excellent, Grant, I so enjoyed this!", "comment_date": "2020-06-10T00:46:45Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Mohd Meraj hussain", "comment_text": "You look like Conan dude", "comment_date": "2020-06-04T06:03:40Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Jack Beyer", "comment_text": "When asked about the quadratic formula I immediately think of ICE tables in general chemistry when finding titration concentrations.", "comment_date": "2020-06-03T23:25:56Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Stas Osypenko", "comment_text": "Also, chemists do some work with quadratic equation", "comment_date": "2020-06-03T14:20:33Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "daryl graham", "comment_text": "Honestly with such an in depth explanation, it&#39;s so easy to recognize where the pieces for the original quadratic formula come from that I find it easier to remember the form with a, b and C now.", "comment_date": "2020-06-01T16:36:10Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Ariff Ansar", "comment_text": "understanding = u^2 * -1000", "comment_date": "2020-06-01T13:09:43Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Kongo Landwalker", "comment_text": "30 minutes of this video explained more than a year at middle school", "comment_date": "2020-05-29T06:15:19Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Groussvader Klaus", "comment_text": "in germany the simple formula is called the &quot;p-q-Formel&quot; where p and q are the scaled coefficients b&#39; and c&#39;,\u00a0<br>and the traditional formula is called the &quot;a-b-c-Formel&quot; or the &quot;Mitternachtsformel&quot; (=midnight-formula) because in German schools you&#39;re taught that this formula is so fundamental that if somebody is going to wake you up in the middle of the night you should be able to know the formula right away (wie aus der pistole geschossen, as we would say)\u00a0<br>lots of love xx", "comment_date": "2020-05-28T22:52:31Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Sadat Rafi", "comment_text": "<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MHXO86wKeDY&amp;t=2m04s\">2:04</a> - Please don&#39;t show math over your face.

Otherwise it&#39;s not a midpoint. Another way to think of the symmetry of &quot;m&quot; between numbers &quot;s&quot; and &quot;r&quot; is that the |d| (absolute value of &quot;d,&quot; which is the distance from &quot;m&quot; to either &quot;r&quot; or &quot;s&quot;) when combined (AKA &quot;|d| * 2&quot; which is also |d| + |d| ) gives me the amount of numbers between two points on a number-line. |d| equals both positive &quot;d&quot; as well as negative &quot;d.&quot;<br>That&#39;s why when putting the two distances together - the distance from the lower number to &quot;m&quot; plus the distance from &quot;m&quot; to the higher number - we will find the distance between &quot;r&quot; and &quot;s.&quot; &quot;m&quot; becomes our point of symmetry, where positive &quot;d&quot; and negative &quot;d&quot; cancel each other out.<br>The value of |d| is  either &quot;d(1)&quot; or &quot;d(-1),&quot; so the solution ends up giving us a zero value for &quot;m&quot; relative to points &quot;r&quot; and &quot;s.&quot; Here&#39;s an example:<br>The midpoint between numbers 40 and 60 is 50. The distance &quot;d&quot; between 40 and 50 is 10, and the distance between 50 and 60 is 10. The total distance between 40 and 60 is |20|.<br>|d| * 2 = (2 * d) and (2 * -d) = |10| * 2 = (2 * 10) and (2 * -10) = 20(1) and 20(-1) AKA |20|<br>This also gives me the reasoning for thinking of the midpoint as zero:<br>The distance between the two numbers 40 and 60 is both 20(1) and 20(-1). They&#39;re both valid solutions, 40 -60 = -20 and 60 - 40 = 20 . As the midpoint is perfectly symmetrical, if we  put the two distances together - those being positive 10 and negative 10, the answer is zero.

I&#39;m a lay mathematician and professional math-science-engineering-teaching tutor and I&#39;d noticed how the Quad Formula can be partitioned into the medial component [-b/(2a)] and the &quot;standard deviation&quot; component [(sqrt(b^2 - 4ac)/(2a)].

Reason being is, in my work with my struggling students, they abhor dealing with fractions and if the quadratic co\u00ebfficient is relatively prime to the linear co\u00ebfficient or the constant, fractions are injected immediately into Grant&#39;s m-d formulation, sometimes in under the root. I have a hunch that few people who tune into a math-geek channel are put-off by fraction-arithmetic, but my computationally weak students appreciate keeping the fractions at bay until the end of the calculation. So, I figure to offer both approaches.<br><br>And, as I think about it a bit, a bit of complication that Grant&#39;s m-d formulation is the cocking-up of calculating discriminants, D = b^2-4ac.

My relationship with the quadratic formula isn&#39;t an option on there. I&#39;ve used it a lot in many of my college classes, and surprisingly in real life multiple times since first &quot;relearning it&quot; about 2 years ago. Enough that it is one of the few formulas that has somehow managed to stick around inside my head somehow unlike a few others. It has uses related to physics and physics describe the world around us. It can also be applied to statistics. <br><br><br>This means if you truly want to understand anything related to mechanics, surveys, and other things, it will appear a lot. If you are measuring  radio waves, ocean waves, radiation waves from the sun, building a parabolic shape with 3d software (even for artistic purposes), building something that has an archway, or trying to find the mean number of people who purchased a certain brand of toilet paper off Amazon due to the pandemic, the quadratic formula will usually apply at some point or another if you decide to look at the math a lot of machines do for us. <br><br><br>I&#39;m a mechanic but I&#39;m studying to become a geoscientist and I&#39;ve used it in almost every class that I have taken so far. It was in all of my math classes especially physics, showed up very briefly in scripting my geology classes, and my atmospheric science class. I&#39;m in a lean six sigma class and can even be used  there when you are doing the statistics for bell curves on data if you pay attention.  <br><br><br>It is ridiculous just how much math actually applies to our physical and digital life, yet people seem to commonly think they will never use algebra after high school. Even when you are grocery shopping if you want to find your total price for 3 loaves of bread, 2 apples, and 4 boxes of crackers, you are using algebra to find the total. Instead of using x, y, and z, you are using foods. <br><br><br>Honestly, I hate math, but I continually fine myself doing it. I completely see it&#39;s validity and purpose. <br><br><br>I don&#39;t think I could do better on my own, but I do prefer factoring when it can be done because it is prettier and easier than the quadratic formula. Unfortunately (or fortunately), I seem to be getting to the point where if it can be factored, I can see that right away and do a lot of the math in my head, so I don&#39;t really need to do much factoring anymore. When it comes to the quadratic formula, my brain likes to do weird things with the numbers transposing them in the process (or reversing the negative and positive numbers) and I end up having to do the problem over again because the answer didn&#39;t make sense. I&#39;m pretty sure I have dyscalculia, but I don&#39;t have a formal diagnosis and I&#39;ve completed high enough levels of math that people have trouble believing me unless they attempt tutoring me in which case when I did get a tutor a while back he got irritated because he felt like I wasn&#39;t paying attention because I had no problem grasping any of the concepts, but kept mixing up numbers, or making &quot;simple mistakes&quot; over and over then fixing it right away as soon as I was told it was wrong or given the right answer. He was getting irritated because he felt like I didn&#39;t actually need a tutor, I just needed to pay attention. At first I did need him to explain some concepts I never really understood in high school like square roots, and I had this nasty fear when I saw more than one letter in an equation that would freeze me up from doing anything else, but he helped me get over that. Then I helped myself get over the &quot;scary shapes (delta, sigma, theta, etc)&quot; but I still freak out a little bit at new shapes for a few mins even if the math equation tells me on the other side what the symbol is doing.", "comment_date": "2020-04-21T13:28:57Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "John Undefined", "comment_text": "This reminds me of the Mathologer video asking why we <i>don&#39;t</i> teach the cubic formula in school.", "comment_date": "2020-04-21T13:28:33Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "LexusAD", "comment_text": "I&#39;m glad that his handwriting is as bad as mine :D", "comment_date": "2020-04-21T12:50:06Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Jolene Mechchic", "comment_text": "I haven&#39;t finished watching this video, but I&#39;m watching it because I have actually ended up using the quadratic formula more times than I want to admit.", "comment_date": "2020-04-21T12:20:01Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Camilla", "comment_text": "Ok but can we all take a moment to appreciate how cute he is \ud83d\ude0d", "comment_date": "2020-04-21T12:13:51Z", "likes_count": 3}, {"comment_by": "Blackbeardjack99", "comment_text": "Grant, could you shift the audiotrack a few milliseconds back?

First re scaling results in b&#39; being -7/3. taking half of that becomes -7/6. then you need to square it as well resulting in 49/36 and now you&#39;re dealing with either an awkward fraction that needs to be subtracted or a messy decimal, which then in turn needs to be square rooted.

Thanks Grant. <br><br>To me the more important thing is Grant&#39;s encouragement to pause and think of different ways of thinking about the problem at hand. This might lead you to solve the problem in different ways. Also thinking of the algebraic problem in terms of geometry and vice versa also makes it easier. The advantage of geometric thinking is it coverts a problem into the visual thinking space. And most people have better grasp of visually demonstrated explanations. This opens up a possibility of solving the problem more simply. More importantly, you might discover more easy way to remember the technique to solve the problem and commit it to long term memory. <br><br>I think students (high school and college STEM students) should learn this technique of meta-thinking even more than the thinking of the problem solution and remembering the formulas taught to you in a wrote fashion. But to me it is more important - to get the benefit of multiplying effect - this kind of meta-thinking should be taught to the teachers who teach the STEM students. And the teachers should almost be required to teach this meta-thinking technique. Of course we have to deal with the fact of limited time (and meager salaries) allotted to the teachers to teach any one topic in any general education system. The reality is that the teachers have to deal with and carry forward students of varying degree of interest and abilities.  However if this becomes a common practice more students will get interested in the class. This will address the question many students flippantly ask - &quot;how is this useful to me in real life?&quot; and then proceed to disregard what is being taught in math and science classes - pretending to be too cool. And once the technique is internalized by the education system, the velocity of subsequent learning will get accelerated. And appeal to the teachers - if you teach like this you can and should and must be paid a lot more money (like best basketball player) - especially in US where teachers are not paid well.<br><br>In a interesting way this issue of interest and appreciation of Science and Math in the society at large is becoming more important as we fight the global pandemic of present time - COVID 19. If the society at large trusts the good science and math, they will insist that the politicians make the policy decisions based on taking input from science. And we need this badly in USA at the moment and going forward.

In fact, it even holds for higher-dimensional quadratics and gives a useful picture of what is the set of roots of a quadratic. <br>So like if you&#39;re working in R^n with some inner product &lt; , &gt; (think the usual vector dot product for example), you can have quadratics of the form f(x) = &lt;x, x&gt; + &lt;u, x&gt; + C, where u is a constant vector in R^n and C a real constant. <br>Let m = -u/2, then you can factor f(x) = &lt;x, x&gt; + 2 &lt;u/2, x&gt; + &lt;u/2, u/2&gt; - ( &lt;u/2, u/2&gt; - C) = &lt;x-m, x-m&gt; - (&lt;m,m&gt; - C) <br>Setting f(x) = 0, we find &lt;x-m, x-m &gt; = &lt;m, m&gt; - C, or equivalently || x-m || = sqrt( ||m||^2 - C ) where || . || : y -&gt; sqrt(&lt;y, y&gt;) is the euclidian norm associated with the inner product &lt; , &gt;. <br>So, in fact, you get the same answer: x is any point on the sphere of center m and radius sqrt(||m||^2 - C) -- aka, midpoint + radius in any direction, just like in the 1d case! You could for instance write that x = m + v * sqrt( ||m||^2 - C) where v is any unit vector (which means ||v|| = 1).<br><br>This tells us that finding the roots of a quadratic speaks in fact of a sphere more than a parabola! :D <br><br>PS : of course, I&#39;m glossing over the cases where there are only 1 root or no R^n valued roots, but I&#39;m sure other people can find nice geometric meaning to those as well ;-)", "comment_date": "2020-04-18T15:19:46Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Jose Alejandro Pe\u00f1a Torres", "comment_text": "i though i knew everything about the quadratic formula so i watched anyway because i love 3b1b videos but that moment at <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MHXO86wKeDY&amp;t=32m24s\">32:24</a>, you always learn something new.

And another use of the quadratic formula is in Chemistry. <br>Let\u00b4s go the whole nine yards, let\u00b4s do what every chemist hates: calculate the pH of a medium strong acid. I\u00b4ll briefly explain why the medium strong case is the annoying one. It\u00b4s where assumptions get us a wrong result. In case of a strong acid  (except sulphuric acid there we just have to double the result.) we say: okay: every molecule of acid fires of one proton. No need for maths. The negative log of your acid concentration is your pH. (cause p always indicates a negative log in chemistry. reason is, chemistry deals with ridiculously small numbers. So whenever we take the log of a concentration or the log of an equilibrium constant or other kinetic constant, we\u00b4ll get a negative number. it\u00b4s no problem, but just an eyesore. Always having that - sign is just a risk of error, so we just say, let\u00b4s define our own operator p, for power, that is nothing but -log base 10, and do away with that) <br>with a weak acid we got to use the law of le chatellier which describes the behaviour of concentrations of product and educt (raw material) in a chemical equilibrium. Variables are some constant K, the educts A and B and the products C and D Bracktes [ ] mean concentration of <br><br><br>it\u00b4s K=[C]*[D]/[A]*[B]   simple let\u00b4s fill that with a bit more life [H2O] is the concentration of water [HA] is the concentration of undissolved acid. [H3O+] is the concentration of H3O+ particles, which are what is formed when an acid reacts with water. and [A-] is the concentration of the acid\u00b4s anion. <br>Obviously as Acids split evenly (we\u00b4re looking at every protolysis level one at a time. so we have to go through the whole ideal for something like ctitric acid three times) [H3O+] =[A-] and we want the negative log of [H30+] so first thing we got to do is find [H3O+] <br>And as [H20] is a constant (no matter how much water we use up, it\u00b4s our solvent, so if we use up water, we lose the volume too so the concentration is a constant) so we multiply it with K to get the acid constant Ka which is by the way well known for every acid. <br><br><br>now we can get to work. Weak acid, we say &quot;we lost nothing of [HA] so we can just use our initial concentration&quot; (whatever we put in) so our Formula would look like this [H3O+]^2 /[HA]=Ks it\u00b4s two lines to solve for [H3O+]. We\u00b4ll get [H3O+]=sqrt[HA]*ks take chemical notation (meaning p=-log)  pH=1/2(pKs-log[HA]) (the KS constant usually is given as it\u00b4s log form by the way. if you google any acid you\u00b4ll find pKa somewhere in the data sheets) <br><br><br>That\u00b4s the simple case. In case of a medium acid: the real concentration of acid, which we absolutely need to know, is [HA]=C0 (starting concentration)-[H3O+] (makes sense right, \u00edf you used up acid, you have to subtract that. With weak acid it just made virtually no difference to do so. with medium acids it will make a difference. And our proton concentration is the best indicator for what we used up.)<br><br><br>So the whole thing looks like ths Ka=[H3O+]^2 /c0-[H3O+] <br>so first things first we get c0*Ka-[H3O+]*ka=[H3O+]^2 subtracting all that over we get<br>[H3O]^2-Ka[H3O+]-cO[Ka]=0 which is perfect for the simplified quadratic formula. c0[Ka] is just a constant times a constant, so another constant meaning it\u00b4s our &quot;q&quot; or i think &quot;m&quot; for you. and as it is negative a real solution is guaranteed.   And while we just brutally solved it and took the log in the medium case, nobody will remember the resulting formula is we do so now, so if we really have to calculate the pH of a medium acid, we just do the footwork on our own", "comment_date": "2020-04-18T13:15:55Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Kentrosauruses", "comment_text": "The original quadratic formula is a generalization of the process of \u201cCompleting the Square\u201d which students also learn is the way to find the vertex of a parabola. <br>The x-value vertex of a parabola will be halfway between the two roots (or halfway between any two points on the parabola with the same value). <br>This way of thinking about the quadratic formula as completing the square is a feature of the Common Core curriculum.

Mathematics are not purely a tool. They are the backbone of logical thinking and abstracting. The principles that lie behind quadratic equations and other kinds of extrapolations of principles are applicable in creating advanced human psychology capable of grasping complexity of the world on another level, which translates to such &quot;unmathematical&quot; things as social relations.  <br>The biggest misery of modern politics is precisely that people who run things are dramatically uneducated and can not operate reasonably. <br>The worst case example are economists who treat mathematics on par with some divination device.  <br><br><br>Education is not here to provide &quot;tools&quot; to &quot;solve&quot; problems that other people give you to solve. This is the basic pitfall of the so called &quot;Bologna reform&quot; in EU, which aimed to transform universities into automatic institutions that produce excvhangable experts in the given field who are then ORDERED by politicians and other such &quot;uneducated&quot; people to solve their problems.  <br>  <br>No, the main objective of education is FORMULATING problems, and providing accurate meta-knowledge to re-define the very notion of reality and goals we encounter in it.  <br><br><br>Education should never be subdued to utility. It is the utility that serves education, which is a vocation within itself.

English academia is in deep crisis. And unless people start paying respect to the scientific principles and to the importance of building proper respect in people of science, British schools are destined to foster mediocrity, careerism and pseudo-scientific scams.  <br><br><br>I repeat, it is not the goal of science to become utility in someones political agenda.

The quadratic formula works. It&#39;s something that can be taught, and as long as that general algebraic understanding is there already, there&#39;s no need to dwell on the topic (like they do in school). The formula is functional, but there is comparatively little that you can do to expand upon the topic without an understanding of topics not generally taught until later. It can be useful for transitioning into the idea of complex numbers, however their utility cannot be properly appreciated without an understanding of trigonometry, which most students do not have at the time of learning. It is because of this that I sincerely hope that in your next lecture you discuss the relationships between trigonometric functions, complex numbers, Euler&#39;s formula, and hyperbolic functions.<br><br>I&#39;m to understand that Grant reads most every comment posted within a reasonable timeframe, however if you&#39;ve made it this far, and you agree that complex numbers and trigonometric functions should be taught together, I ask that you like this comment, so Grant may see that the idea is infact not beyond the capabilities of his audience to understand, or at least have a desire to understand.

And you make the claims that b\u2019 =-(r+s) and c\u2019=rs. When you said this it immediately connected so many branches of maths in my head. For my further maths A level course we have a topic on roots of polynomials and we learn the fact that for a quadratic with roots r,s (we normally use Greek letters because maths just loves to use the Greek alphabet) that the sum of the roots is -b/a. And if you look at your formula. What is b\u2019 but the rescaling of b after we\u2019ve divided everything by a. Bring the minus sign across and the formulas match. Similarly we learn that the product of the roots is c/a which is the exact value of your c\u2019. When I first learnt this stuff I found it amazing and thought why don\u2019t we get taught this in the base maths a level course. Only 5 people in my school do further maths and as thought everyone needed to hear this. But as the UK system often works, stuff just doesn\u2019t get quite explored enough. It\u2019s pretty much exclusively used to answer questions of the form this equation has roots r,s find the equation with roots 2r+1, 2s+1. Which don\u2019t get me wrong, it\u2019s cool that it gives us that method, but tying it all back the the quadratic formula is so much more enlightening.<br>But the reason I wanted to write this comment is we learn for more than quadratics, in fact there is a pattern for polynomials with arbitrary order. In practice the equations get unwieldy to work with, and we are flat out told they\u2019ll never give us anything worse than quartic, but the pattern holds in defiantly. For quadratic ax^2 +bx +c, -b/a = sum of roots and c/a = product of roots. For a cubic ax^3+bx^2+cx+d, -b/a = sum of roots, c/a = sum of product pairs, -d/a = product of roots. That might sound weird so let\u2019s say it has roots r,s,t. This means r+s+t=-b/a, rs+st+tr = c/a, rst=-d/a. This pattern holds indefinatly with quartics being sum, sum of pairs, sum of threes, product with these being each coefficient/a with alternating sign. But this pattern now I think about it seems arbitrary, and I don\u2019t know where it\u2019s come from. So you have inspired me, in the time up to your next lecture, to investigate the connections to a cubic or quartic equation, and try to refactor stuff in your simplified manner of thinking about mean and standard deviation of the roots.<br>To anyone who actually read this essay, I salute you.", "comment_date": "2020-04-17T23:20:25Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Schr\u00f6dinger", "comment_text": "I just loved it.", "comment_date": "2020-04-17T23:18:50Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Arik Wolf", "comment_text": "You are a much better math teacher than any teacher in my schools.", "comment_date": "2020-04-17T23:18:34Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "lllbutcher", "comment_text": "Started listening late.<br>Did you mention that &quot;m&quot; is the point of inflection of the quadratic?", "comment_date": "2020-04-17T23:17:02Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Ali Saleh", "comment_text": "Thank you very much for a wonderful video.", "comment_date": "2020-04-17T23:13:09Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Lucas Mucida", "comment_text": "I am a professor and you inspire me.

Although I\u2019m a huge fan of new ways of doing things and of this channel, this method is for me more complicated than it needs to be. It really is completing the square in disguise. The examples you used - just complete the square and you have the turning point (i.e. m) and from that can jump to the solutions, turning point +- sq root of y coordinate. It also instantly tells you if you have real/imaginary solutions. The video you mentioned a couple of months ago had the same flaw. I don\u2019t mean to be critical but there is a better way of doing it. I did wonder if it was going to be completing the square. Loved the difference of two squares arithmetic at the start. Yes you can do any multiplication that way too. Eg 17 x 21 = 19^2 - 2^2. But you need a quick squaring method. I devised one years ago and is on my channel. So you get 361 - 4 = 357. I was also pleased to see you reference the binomial square. This has a lot of application in arithmetic but is under utilised.

Rather than being angry and condemning what you see, allow it to show you what will not work for you, what you will not do and where you will draw the line.<br><br>It is this elimination of possibilities through careful observation that will bring you closer to your true goal. For, indeed, you were sent into the world for a greater purpose, and this purpose is held within you, within a deeper Intelligence called Knowledge. It is beyond your intellect. It is beyond your fears and desires. It is waiting there to be discovered.<br><br>What brings you closer to Knowledge is eliminating other possibilities that are attractive. You can recognize the truth of these possibilities through careful and objective observation. You do not in most cases have to go live out the reality of these things, which will take up so much of your time and energy and resources. Self-discovery here is a process of refinement.
