Now, the confusion I have is at the point when I mix the two ideas. 0+1=1 so I could have a subset A with p=1 and another subset B with p=0. Based on the above information, I would say that A will definitely inevitably always happen while B still can happen. and here I fall in the contradiction that A and B can happen in the same time!

The line is a 1-dimensional element with unit length.  Since the unis do not match, the point cannot be meaningfully scaled by any factor to match the line.   There is no scalar quantity that will turn a 0-dimensional element into a 1-dimensional element.  Talking about the probability of an exact number occurring on a continuous probability curve doesn&#39;t make any sense.  You end up dealing with infinities (infinite samples, infinite time, infinite distances) and infinities can be used to prove all sorts of nonsense.  If you end up with infinities, chances are you did something wrong.  Instead of an exact value you have to use a range.  P(h = 0.70000001) &gt; 0 is meaningless.

As I remember, the probability of 0 means always impossible in discrete probability, because the probability of the event is defined as number favorable outcomes divided by the number of all possible outcomes. So the only way to get zero is when there is 0 favorable outcomes, which mean that those outcomes aren&#39;t in the set of all possible outcomes and therefore it cannot occur. And if it occurs, then it must be in the set of all possible outcomes and therefore has non zero probability. In the case of continuous probability, I think that there just cases when it doesn&#39;t make sense to ask what the probability of the event is. For example, imagine that we are generating random numbers inside a unit circle centered in (0, 0), then the probability of generating certain number in a certain region is (if consider that distribution is uniform) the area of the region divided by total area of circle (considering that the region is fully contained inside the circle). But when you are working with regions that doesn&#39;t have area, than the probability will always be zero, because the integral over that region would always be zero (if I am not wrong). So the only meaningful way of talking about probabilities in this context is to consider region that has area. If you consider what is probability of generating number inside a square defined by 2 &lt;= x &lt;= 3, 0 &lt;= y &lt;= 1, than the probability would be zero and it does mean that it is impossible to generate number that are inside that square, because, well, we are generating numbers inside a circle and clearly the square doesn&#39;t intersect with the circle. But if we could generate number that would be inside that square, that it must mean that the probability isn&#39;t zero. And this reasoning should apply for every region that has non zero area. Basically what I want to say is that, as I think, if we consider regions that have areas, than the probability of 0 would always mean that the event is impossible. But it&#39;s just what I could conclude whit my poor knowledge of probabilities, so I might be wrong. <br><br>Note: while I was writing that comment, I realized that that last part might not be true. If we generate some discrete points (or, maybe, infinitely many that doesn&#39;t form a region with area) in the square, then the probability of generating number inside the square might be zero while it is still possible to generate number that is inside the square. But in that case we won&#39;t be able to calculate the probability of generating the number inside a square by dividing its area with the area of the whole domain (because that set of points doesn&#39;t have area). So I think that in that case we are running into the same problem and it doesn&#39;t make sense to ask what is the probability, but I am not sure.", "comment_date": "2020-07-12T21:48:38Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "ANKUSH GARG", "comment_text": "Is part 3 out yet?", "comment_date": "2020-07-10T10:55:09Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "V\u00edtor Bortolin", "comment_text": "Part 3, please!", "comment_date": "2020-07-09T14:36:05Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Sonu Yadav", "comment_text": "In simple words , probability is the ratio of outcome upon  space set (space) , but when it comes to continuous Random variable , a smallest set also contains uncountable infinity and if a single number is divided by  a set you get zero  ,and when you take a set (integral ) divided by a set you will get some number , and what I feel more absurd thing is, set of whole number and rational number has same Lebesgue measure .

The point its that you are representanting it with a normal fuction when it should follow a \u201cdiscrete uniform\u201d ,and  transform it to continuous if you need that (for whatever reason). So there are some certain points in a infinite range of numbers (x=1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10) that their sumatory would be 1  , and their probabilities would be a number /=0 , to be infinite around 0s doesnt change their probability. Btw you also misunderstood what a pdf is , pdf is a fuction where we can know exactly the probabily of A POINT in a countinous case , but when we integrate it we can calculate AREAS , this integrate is called \u201ccdf\u201d , the point its that a \u201cdiscrete uniform\u201d converted to countious its a wayy to different function from a \u201ccontinous uniform\u201d (that neither its well representated in the video, due you used a normal distribution) besides their name its similar. In this last one , the continous uniform , a pdf would be aproximatly 0 because its too small, but has a value. So basically, the problem is that the video fuction represents a \u201cnormal distribution\u201d , for a \u201cdiscrete uniform distribution\u201d where u are applying \u201ccontinous uniform distribution\u201d , and the change wayy too much.

I wanted to share one thing that did not appear in your animation since you did not appear to discretize your points along the circle or sphere. If you do discertize the points and project them from a sphere into the 2D plane, then there are discontinuities in the projection after any rotation is performed unless your points are evenly spaced along theta and phi, and also that you have an number of evenly spaced points N that is a power of 9.

It&#39;s just my opinion but I think that covering the basics needed to understand one or two satisfying and sometimes advanced corners of a topic (advanced for someone who is just starting probability) is far more enjoyable then it is educational.

The way this works is, if F is the CDF for a real-valued random variable X, then F(a) is the probability that the true value of X is less than or equal to a.  If X is a discrete random variable with probability mass function p, then F(a) is the sum of p(t) for t from \u2212\u221e to a, and if X is a continuous random variable with probability density function f, then F(x) is the integral of f(t)dt for t from \u2212\u221e to a (and if X is a random variable with Borel measure \u03bc, then F(x) is the measure under \u03bc of the closed interval from \u2212\u221e to a).  But if you work with F all along, then you don&#39;t have to discuss measure, or integration, or even summation.  You do have to talk about one-sided limits, but as this is a Calculus topic that comes well before even Riemann integration, that&#39;s not too bad.\r<br>\r<br>Some example calculations:  F(b) minus F(a) is the probability that the value of X is in the range from a to b, <i>including</i> b but <i>excluding</i> a.  (This is true regardless of whether the distribution is discrete, continuous, or a mixture of these.)  If you want the probability including <i>both</i> a and b, then you use the limit of F(b) minus F(t) as t approaches a from below.  If instead you want the probability including <i>neither</i> a nor b, then you use the limit of F(t) minus F(a) as t approaches b from below.  If you want the probability that the value is exactly a, then this is the limit of F(a) minus F(t) as t approaches a from below; this is zero if F is continuous at a but positive if F is discontinuous at a.  (In general, where F is continuous, the probabilities are continuous; and where F is discontinuous or constant, the probabilities are discrete.)\r<br>\r<br>Technicalities:  A real-valued function F, defined on the entire real line, counts as a CDF of something if F is weakly increasing (aka non-decreasing), all one-sided limits exist, the right-hand limits equal the values of the function (so F is right-continuous), the limit approaching \u2212\u221e is 0, and the limit approaching \u221e is 1.  (It&#39;s a theorem that such functions correspond one-to-one with Borel measures on the real line, as in my first paragraph.)  So you can start probability theory working with this concept, and the only thing from Calculus that you need to define it is one-sided limits.\r<br>\r<br>This is not to say that you can do all of probability theory without bringing in integrals or measures!  If you want to define the expectation value, for example, using only a random variable&#39;s CDF, then you can&#39;t do this with just limits.  (You have to use the Lebesgue\u2013Stieltjes integral, in general.)  So this is not a panacea.

Then the probability that the one which obtains is in the collection of possibilities is 1. Since we don&#39;t know which possibility obtains, we have to treat their probabilities as equal.

If you add them up, this set of constants add up to infinity, but they are arranged in such a way that if you multiply this infinity by that other 0 you get precisely 1. This way, if you just add a subset of it, you get something between 0 and 1, which is the probability. I remember playing with the Maxwell-Boltzmann speed distribution, and for temperatures really near 0K the small velocities reached values much greater than 1. However, if you multiply these probabilities by their respective 0 we call dx, we still get 0.

Infiniti is tricky, and well we have functional definitions in maths but the philosophy of this is a bit obtuse in my opinion. If you where to have somebody pick a random irrasional number and you where going to guess it, the probability of being correct is actually 0, because any region of numbers sorrounding any point contains infinite irrasional numbers, you cannot guess correctly even in principle. Unless there is some exsternal reason for you knowing about what the choice is by some argument.

In a more philosophical sense any kind of chance is 50-50, as it either happens or it doesn&#39;t. Regardless of whether it is possible or not. And regardless of the expected frequency for something to happen. Especially when it comes to an individual person and their experience through life, the only thing that really matters is whether something happens or not. It&#39;s not relevant if there&#39;s a 90% it shouldn&#39;t happen, yet you&#39;re &#39;lucky enough&#39; to be part of the 10% of cases it does. Same goes for winning the lottery. Yes, so the chance is unimaginably small for someone to win (obviously), however I don&#39;t think anyone who ever won anything in a lottery will agree it made much of a difference. A chance of 0 does not mean it is possible, not even in mathematics. Because it suggests 100% of whatever is opposite of it would (always) happen. A small chance is different from no chance at all, ergo a probability of 0 is surely impossible. The only exception I can think of is when preconditions aren&#39;t met for something <i>else</i> to become probable, however it would be more mathematically accurate to take the full picture into account at that point anyway, instead of pretending there&#39;s no cause and effect at play and things would just spontaneously occur. In fact, I dare say a lot of probabilities would chance in an instant if conditions are more favorable towards one outcome than the other, as that&#39;s simply how reality works. If you never buy or own a lottery ticket, it <b>will</b> be impossible to win the lottery. If you buy just one ticket every ten years, you&#39;ll still have a much smaller chance to win than whomever buys a lottery ticket every week. To pretend someone who never buys or otherwise owns a lottery ticket magically has the possibility to win anyway, ergo an actual 0% probability is not an impossibility in and of itself, is crazy!
