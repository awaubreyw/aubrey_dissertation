The question regarding COVID-19 is, how many infected people will become so sick that they will need a hospital treatment, how many of these will need intensive care, and how many will die? Furthermore, what is the demographic distribution here? Governments and media keep reiterating the mantra of COVID-19 being very dangerous, when the numbers available now clearly suggest it is not that dangerous, and that it is mostly dangerous to the elderly and very old people. Interestingly, the mortality of COVID-19 very closely follows the natural mortality pattern (letality = how many infected die, mortality = how many of the entire population die). At an age of 80+, your chance to die from COVID-19 is orders of magnitude higher than for people younger than 60.  This doesn&#39;t mean that no young people can die of COVID-19, but the chance and the numbers are very low and the suggestion it would be otherwise and COVID-19 would be equally dangerous for everybody is simply not true. It is therefore important to protect the elderly as good as possible (and if they wish so), and let the others run our economy before it has completely gone down the gutter (one effect of which would our health care systems breaking down).", "comment_date": "2020-11-12T20:54:17Z", "likes_count": 2}, {"comment_by": "chrisksamuel", "comment_text": "I learned more about exponential growth in this video then I did reading my calculus textbook lol. please make more thanks!!", "comment_date": "2020-11-11T20:07:38Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Aero Hernon", "comment_text": "Kinda weird to see numbers so low back then.

Even then the predictive power will be limited.  Although there is always a desire - indeed a demand to predict the future, it will remain ultimately an impossible task.  The accuracy of a forecast diminishes to a vanishingly small figure the longer the period into the future it purports to make.  An everyday example is the daily weather forecast.  A one day projection is often possible; two days is iffy; three days forward or one week is for practical purposes impossible.", "comment_date": "2020-05-24T13:02:12Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "D.

March (this means, before the shutdown and any other measures affected the number of deaths), and make a regression, you can actually show, that you have no exponential function (R\u00b2 is about 0,1, already 30 days after the first death).

With economic recession as a variable that also differs for each country and medical resources as another each of which bring the PNR closer in time it is safe to say that we&#39;ve passed the PNR a long time already and everyone should do as Sweden is doing instead of looking towards China always whom have a very advanced government AI which helped them track&amp;trace individuals that made it possible for them to flatten the curve with better hospitals etc. <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23SocialDistancing\">#SocialDistancing</a> <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23socialisolation\">#socialisolation</a> <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23SocialDistancingNow\">#SocialDistancingNow</a> <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23SocialDistancingWorks\">#SocialDistancingWorks</a> <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23SocialDistancingPickUpLines\">#SocialDistancingPickUpLines</a> <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23SocialDistancingSavesLives\">#SocialDistancingSavesLives</a> <br><a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23socialdistancinglife\">#socialdistancinglife</a> <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23SocialDistancing2020\">#SocialDistancing2020</a> <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23socialdistancingfail\">#socialdistancingfail</a> <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23SouthAfricaLockdown\">#SouthAfricaLockdown</a> <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23StayHomeSA\">#StayHomeSA</a> <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23SAlockdown\">#SAlockdown</a><br><a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23StillBreathingSA\">#StillBreathingSA</a> <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23SANDF\">#SANDF</a> <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23socialdistancingatitsbest\">#socialdistancingatitsbest</a> <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23SocialDistance\">#SocialDistance</a> <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23SocialSecurity\">#SocialSecurity</a> <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23SocialDistanceChallenge\">#SocialDistanceChallenge</a> <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23CoronavirusInSA\">#CoronavirusInSA</a> <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23CoronaVillains\">#CoronaVillains</a>  <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23COVID19SouthAfrica\">#COVID19SouthAfrica</a> <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23Covid19SA\">#Covid19SA</a>", "comment_date": "2020-04-15T06:55:20Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Mythical Vigilante", "comment_text": "How many subscribers did Eric Weinstein\u2019s mention on Rogan get this channel I wonder. \ud83e\uddd0", "comment_date": "2020-04-15T06:23:34Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Dieter Schnulli", "comment_text": "Where are the Testcounts in your Story", "comment_date": "2020-04-14T16:48:08Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Jefferson Souza", "comment_text": "4 months to hit 1 million<br><br><br>10 days to hit 2 million<br><br><br>A few days later 4 million, of course not everyone is tested so might be more.<br><br><br>I think this is going to be the same as the Spanish flu.

There is a parallel to saturated enzyme kinetics here - except that the only thing affected by this testing saturation is our analysis  and understanding.  In addition, almost every nation has a very skewed testing protocol for the limited testing ability.  The &quot;growth curve&quot; has shown a linear trend for several weeks which simply represents the limited testing abilities have been saturated.

For exponential growth in biological systems such as this one, why does the growth eventually deviate from the exponential curve?\r<br>\r<br>5.

Further more, the expert said that there is reason to believe that the virus is spread through <i>aerosols</i> that may linger in the air for up to an hour after an infected has caughed or sneezed, or even stood there and breathed, so people also need facemasks to limit the spread of the virus. \r<br>\r<br>Nyborg also criticizes the NIPH estimate for how many could need hospitalization in Norway.

Because, correct me if I&#39;m wrong or missing something but, if that is still accurate and the death rate remains 2 to 4 percent that does still mean that the eventual number could be anywhere between 77 million to 184 million deaths. That would actually be WW2 territory or even way beyond (the total death in ww2 are estimated to be around 69 to 84 millon, that includes direct and inderect deaths). And IF <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kas0tIxDvrg&amp;t=3m15s\">3:15</a> would turn out to be correct in even the slightest way, since a vaccine is said to be at least 1 to 1,5 years away it sould easily have plenty of time to get up to that 50 to 60 percent infection rate even if it would be far less. But all this is still not to mention the danger of the virus mutating to an even more deadly and efficent form, which it already did. It has mutated from the S-type to the L-type and that does turn out to be more infectious and aggressive. Also they&#39;ve said (in news) that scientist do not rule out the possibillity (and actually think it is more or less inevitable) that the virus will mutate further and become possibly even more infectious and aggressive. Even if we&#39;d be able to keep the worldwide infection rate at 10 percent, that would still mean some 15 to 30 million people would die from this. To put this in perspective, WW1 death are estimated to be about 20 million, NY state has about 20 million inhabitants, California state has about 30 million inhabitants,  Texas state has a little less that 30 million inhabitants.

A key to this calculation you neglected to mention is .. ARE the number of cases accurate.  IE .. analysis of the Diagnosed cases to date in China show that 80% of the people who contract the virus develop a mild fever can hacking cough.  Nothing life threatening and mild enough the average person will take some meds and go to work, school, whatever.  The frightening aspect of this discovery is since not everyone is going to the hospital or to a doctor when they get sick, there are a lot of cases out there not being diagnosed.  This is what it&#39;s in what, 36 US states now and they can&#39;t track most back to a source.  Not everyone reports the illness or is spotted, only those in the 20% getting a worse case  (The 80% comes from the extensive quarantines China used .. anyone in contact with the hospitalized person were quarantined and monitored and of those who develop the virus only 20% needed additional care).  <br><br>In regards to this formula, what that means is the N sub d is higher every single day that previously reported,  Interestingly enough, this could mean P is also lower.  The factor  (1 + E * p) from the formula is based on the current numbers.  But lets say there are an Undiagnosed group a d U sub d.  Now if the change in N day to day is due to increased scrutiny, they trace back from patient X and discover all the people they had contact with and test them, this aggressive tracking could be finding more of those infected than what is spreading now.  So U sub (d+1) may increase at a slower rate compared to U sub d just due to their finding more of the people who are infected (now .. for example extensive testing of everyone on a cruise ship).  That would mean the overall total cases is advancing more slowly and we are close to the inflection than thought.  <br><br>What I haven&#39;t seen is good numbers off the cruise ships.  Perfect test cases.  X passengers, closed system, how many days until Y were infected, chart the numbers .. presto a complete and accurate model to apply to the real world.  Well except for the fact that in a close system like a cruise ship p would be higher due to the confined spaces and air circulation process on the ships.  <br><br>Anyway one can hope that U sub d to U sub (d+1) is lower, as then we are closer to the end.  Because if U sub d compared to U sub (d+1) is a higher rate than the diagnosed set, well .. we have a long long road to go then.", "comment_date": "2020-03-10T02:59:25Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "F R E S H N E S S", "comment_text": "&#39;If nobody is worried that&#39;s when you should worry&#39;.

It will help people react to the very serious coronavirus situation more rationally and responsibly.  Although this will go in one ear and out the other for most, even though these principles are likely to determine the fate of some they know and love, I hope this can wake up some of our policymakers at least.<br><br>More importantly, I believe there is a very serious shortfall in the general understanding of how the failure to account for the time lag from onset to death results in surprisingly gross underestimates of CASE fatality rate when CFR is determined by dividing current deaths by current cases.  If for a simplified hypothetical virus the doubling time is five days, the fatality rate FOR RESOLVED CASES is 10% and every fatality takes place 18 days after diagnosis, the na\u00efve CASE fatality rate (current cumulative deaths / current cumulative cases) will be only 0.82% while the virus is spreading.  Many epidemiologists, public health experts and journalist really don&#39;t get this.  It&#39;s hard to imagine this being the case given the gravity of the situation, but sadly, I know from extensive experience that most often even public health experts are unable or unwilling to comprehend this.<br><br>I&#39;ve been working hard on social media to wake them up, but sadly, most are too math impaired, proud and herd mentality minded to think this through.  The prevailing mindset is that we should start with the na\u00efve case fatality rate and then lower our estimates based on expectations that a given proportion of cases go undiagnosed, with that proportion being pulled out of thin air.  They&#39;re starting with a serious conceptual error regarding CASE fatality rate by not deriving it from a time period for which cases have largely resolved, then revising their estimate down with nothing but a hand waving argument about undiagnosed cases.<br><br>(CASE fatality rate, better referred to as CASE fatality ratio, is DEFINED as the ratio of deaths to DIAGNOSED cases over a given period and population.) <br><br>We should instead determine the true (or resolved) CASE fatality rate by looking at diagnosed cases with date of onset such that all or almost all cases will have had time to resolve through recovery or death.  There are now many thousands of cases we can consider in this way.  The CFR they reveal will be (and in fact IS) a BIG number, much bigger than the 1% to 3.4% na\u00efve case fatality rates that are now often quoted.  Once we come to grips with just how big that resolved case fatality rate is, we can consider revising it down by some rational, scientifically sound estimate of the prevalence of undiagnosed cases.  The World Health Organization went looking for those unresolved cases while they were in China and didn&#39;t find many of them.  In addition, most of the widely accessible data is cumulative and hides the much needed specifics that older case information contains.  We really need readily accessible datasets that include records for each case, including dates of onset, diagnosis and recovery or death.  If not that, at least we need period specific data.  The China CDC provided some of that information on February 14.  It&#39;s available here. <a href=\"https://github.com/cmrivers/ncov/blob/master/COVID-19.pdf\">https://github.com/cmrivers/ncov/blob/master/COVID-19.pdf</a><br><br>I believe it would be immensely helpful if you could do a video addressing this issue.

It has to be stressed that the <i>growth</i> we see in the number of infected, may in fact <i>not</i> be due to the actual number of cases. Instead it&#39;s most likely due to <i>testing conditions.</i> This introduces some uncertainty and bias, since we&#39;ll never know the <i>true</i> amount of people who are infected. We just know the number of infeted that are <i>discovered</i> through testing. And the conditions for how those tests are carried out, and how often, may differ depending on various factors such as economy, preparedness and perceived urgency and need.<br><br>One conclusion we can draw from this, is for instance that the <i>lethality</i> (what percentage of the infected who dies) will <i>increase</i> as fewer tests are carried out.<br><br>This is the case in Italy, where only severe cases of flu are now tested for the Corona virus. So while the lethality seems to increase in Italy, it does not reflect the <i>true</i> amount of people who are infected over there, only the subset of people who get such a severe infection that the medical authorities deem it necessary to administer the test. For that reason the disease might <i>seem</i> more deadly in Italy than it actually is.

And I am indeed in the camp of thinking that the more effort that is put into stomping out the spread of COVID-19 \u2022now\u2022 rather than later; the more testing that becomes available in the general public, the better.  You want to starve the virus by fire-walling it and preventing it from leaping from one susceptible population to another.  I live in Prescott, Arizona, and the phenomenon of wildfire spread is quite similar; the more effort to starving it of fuel (unburnt trees) and building firebreaks is quite close to what you do to prevent a viral spread before it gains a foothold.<br><br>As much as I love 3Blue1Brown, I find a bit of fault in the mathematics presented being a bit too oversimplified, or shoe-horning a more complex dynamic to that which is \u201cexponentially growing\u201d at first and then shifting to an \u201cexponentially decaying\u201d dynamic after, as I\u2019ll explain in a moment.  Also, all of the modeling suggests that the inevitable end state is 100% infection, and except for the infection of mitochondria in our cells (a necessary organelle in cells which is believed to have come from an infectious source in early evolution of cells), no infection ever reaches 100% of a population.<br><br>Instead of this type of modeling, what epidemiologists often use are SIR models, or what might be more appropriate for COVID-19 modeling would be a somewhat more complex SEIR model, but befitting of a virus in which you may have people exposed to and infected by the virus (the \u2018E\u2019 part), but who may not be infectious (\u2018I\u2019) for a significant delay.  For COVID-19, that delay is believed to be 2-14 days, averaging about five days, while for most types of influenza the average might be about two or three days.<br><br>SIR and SEIR modeling requires thinking about a population of humans, or animals (or whatever) as being in one of four states (admittedly that is a bit of a simplification of reality), and then using differential calculus to model the dynamics of such a system with known paths, probabilities, and delays of time bouncing from one state to another:<br>S = susceptible population (or normalized as fraction of population ranging from 0.0 to 1.0)<br>E = population exposed and infected (or normalized to 0.0 to 1.0 fraction)<br>I = infectious population (those infecting others, whether symptomatic or asymptomatic)<br>R = removed population (those who can no longer infect others, through recovery and immunity, or death)<br><br>Sometimes the \u2018R\u2019 is thought of as \u2018recovered\u2019, but that is not quite accurate.  If you want the differential equations that result to be somewhat neat and tidy, you somewhat callously have to say dead people and recovered people behave about the same as being an \u201cend state\u201d\u00a0in which they cannot participate in adding to the \u201cE\u201d or \u201cI\u201d populations by infecting others.  It is not clear if someone who has recovered from COVID-19 is immune (as would be the case for the measles or mumps, or a particular strain of flu or cold before the virus mutates), or if someone recovered from COVID-19 can be re-infected one or more times down the line (as would be the case most notoriously for something like tuberculosis).  That re-infection would add considerable complexity to the modeling as another path, or loop, in the state dynamics.   If COVID-19 can reinfect those who were previously recovered, then the path from infection would be either to death or back to being susceptible all over again, adding more fuel for the spread of the virus.<br><br>There are online tutorials and courses in the mathematics of SIR modeling, which involve first-order differential equations on two variables, S and I.  The \u201cR\u201d can be, but not be modeled as a third variable since removed persons, dead or recovered with immunity, cannot reinfect any others.  So you could say that the total population of persons alive or dead is N=S+I+R at any point, and if we simplify things and think of N being constant (again, alive or dead), then clearly R=N-S-I and is simply a function of S and I, and not its own variable.<br><br>I recommend studying the math presented in these two videos talking about the SIR model (I couldn\u2019t find a good YouTube video on the more complex SEIR model).  A lot depends on the initial conditions for S and I, the number (or fraction) of susceptible and infected persons, and also the constants which control spread rate (usually expressed as the Greek letter beta; \u03b2, or \u03b2/N to get the dimensionality correct, defining \u03b2 as a unit-less or &#39;pure&#39; constant) and rate of removal (recovery or death; usually represented as the Greek letter nu; \u03bd).<br><br>SIR epidemic modeling explained without the differential calculus:<br>[1]  <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWXqXzAYe4E\">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWXqXzAYe4E</a><br><br>SIR modeling explained with the differential equations:<br>[2]  <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=06wnwSEHZPY\">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=06wnwSEHZPY</a><br>[3]  <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ISHVGtEyBPs\">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ISHVGtEyBPs</a><br><br>SEIR modeling explained without differential calculus:<br>[4]  <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TW8AVMFPXzU\">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TW8AVMFPXzU</a><br><br>SEIR modeling explained with the differential equations:<br>[Sadly, I couldn\u2019t find good examples of this, WITH the math, because generally the SIR model is talked about in more detail, involving the easier math.]<br><br>SEIR modeling is likely to be the best modeling technique we have for understanding the spread of the COVID-19 disease both in any portion of the world, and also globally.  This does not mean that it would be easy to construct a model which accurately describes the effect that mitigation efforts might have:  travel bans, school closures, factory shutdowns, mandatory quarantines affecting entire regions (towns, cities, counties, etc).  One researcher at Harvard, Marc Lipsitch made global news in late February for making the dire prediction that his SEIRS-based analysis would result in a stable infection rate of 40-70% of the world population, from which you can extrapolate millions of deaths and significant shortening of the longevity of humans until a vaccine can be developed to change the dynamics significantly.  But I think (actually, more like I hope) that his math, though sound purely within the realm of mathematical thinking, underestimates the power that public understanding of COVID-19 and medical/governmental efforts to contain it regionally, will have in dramatically altering the dynamics of the system, and the final stable point of COVID-19 infections.<br><br>I hope that, as occurred with SARS and the SARS-CoV virus, COVID-19 and the 2019-CoV (aka SARS-CoV-2) virus will be considered extremely rare and treatable.  But from the standpoint of SEIR modeling, Marc Lipsitch\u2019s paper is quite important to understand, and also to critique for perhaps underestimating our ability to stop the virus and wall off susceptible populations in a major way.<br><br>[5]  <a href=\"https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.04.20031112v1.full.pdf\">https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.04.20031112v1.full.pdf</a><br><br>-- END --", "comment_date": "2020-03-09T01:25:20Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Chris2008", "comment_text": "We are doomed.", "comment_date": "2020-03-09T01:25:09Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Cheolhyeon Park", "comment_text": "Great clip", "comment_date": "2020-03-09T01:23:53Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Nicholai Corbie", "comment_text": "The graphics made this so much easier to understand kudos", "comment_date": "2020-03-09T01:23:20Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "War and The Corridors of Time", "comment_text": "NOTHING has enraged me more in the last couple of years than people coughing without covering their mouths and the carelessness of not infecting others.

I watched it go from returning to zero and that date stretching into the future, to it flipping upward on the 15th and the 100% infected date racing nearer. I kept notes of when each order of magnitude was reached on the line and it just got worse and worse until Feb 29th where we stopped outpacing the curve and the 100% date halted at exactly 1 year from now. Then it moved one day away by the 3rd, and the next day I noticed that many of the historical numbers were slightly different than what I had recorded,(I figure most of that was &quot;sorry we didn&#39;t get these results to you the day of&quot;, but we did somehow subtract a few confirmed cases according to that source.) which perturbed me. I&#39;ve preserved the record of what was originally reported and repopulated another graph with the current numbers(leaving more days time between the present and entered data&#39;s date, to give them more time for accurate numbers to settle, so &quot;current&quot; means a few days back) and that 100% date is still accelerating its retreat.

Those who recover (or die) are no longer able to spread it, and so don&#39;t factor into the growth equation.  The faster the growth, the less this matters, since at each point on the curve most people with the virus will have only contracted it recently, but especially in the long run or with slower growth, any realistic model has to consider this.

Really the growth factor (1+p.E) should be applied to number of real cases (p prob of passing it on per contact, E number of people in contact with). However, to get to the number of recorded cases there is also a recorded (diagnosed) fraction - what fraction of real cases have been recorded? <br><br>Nd(Recorded) = Nd(Actual) * f_Recorded. <br><br>This simple formula does assumes all diagnoses happen immediately and are reported immediately (i.e. same day, assume index d refers to day). Diagnosis and reporting are subject to delay, and possibly other revisions. <br><br>It would be possible for Nd(Actual) to be static and f_Recorded simply to be rising exponentially to produce exponential growth in the recorded number Nd(Recorded). This might happen if awareness and diagnostic testing availability was rising exponentially. All countries are behind with their diagnostic and recording rates to various degrees.<br><br>Obviously, the reality is somewhere in between the Nd(Recorded) = Nd(Actual) model presented in the video and one where Nd(Actual) is constant (too optimistic). <br><br>The tragedy of the increasing numbers of people being recorded as dying does indicate the Nd(actual) must have been getting higher in the past unless the recording of all deaths has also been suppressed which is less likely. There is a lag of many weeks between the day of actual infection and the day of (that much less frequent and tragic) recording of a person\u2019s death.

Therefore a disease a virus can spread through our species extremely quickly and at an alarming rate.<br><br><br> just take any room in any house the more people you put in that room the easier it is for something to spread around the room because there is no space between people, and that is happening in our world there is no space between humans we are chock-a-block go to any city in any country open your eyes and you will see I am right.<br><br>  I believe this is a wake-up call to the human race to start controlling our population and bringing our numbers down to an acceptable level where there is no need to have an endless number of people to feed an endless growth policy.   it is this policy of endless growth that goes by the name of economic growth that is creating all the problems we are infested with.   and the reason we can&#39;t solve any of these problems because to solve them we have to get rid of this system that is creating them. that&#39;s why the  only solution your politicians have to solve these problems is throwing money at them and as you can see it doesn&#39;t work because they are getting bigger and bigger.  we have to build more homes.  we have to build bigger hospitals.  more roads that is not the answer to solving these problems.<br><br>If we reduce our numbers then we reduce the amount of people moving around the world  which will make it very easy to isolate a virus or a disease  and stop it from spreading across the world.   <br><br>For capitalism to work with a fiat currency as it&#39;s basis the population must continue to expand. The more people the more destruction the more easier it is for a virus or disease to spread.   we are our own worst enemy because we are controlled by greed and selfishness.  the more people have the more people want they are never satisfied.    it will be our downfall.", "comment_date": "2020-03-08T19:40:49Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "the last bear bender", "comment_text": "Imagine people dying and You&#39;re solving this equation", "comment_date": "2020-03-08T19:40:31Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Pandabrain", "comment_text": "That&#39;s why i look up data about covid-19 cases on [worldometers dot info] (coronavirus link at the top).
