A stupid scholar all overturned this truth and built it to a convenient system of Mason. Thus, the people believe the trickery of the devil than words of God. Darwin&#39;s evolutionary theory, the Copernican theory of Galileo, the theory of relativity, quantum mechanics, mathematics, the medicine of Einstein are all errors. A ghost, a UFO, supernatural power, the miracle of God to be said to be the occult are rather true. A thing and a ghost (God) exist in the world, and space is active by spiritual power (conception) of God. As for God, all things were created by the soul of language. It is clear if I read the Bible. Because the present scholar mixes the logic thoroughly in human wisdom, it cannot arrive at the truth. It is intuitive power to be important. Why does a child seem to be? The thing which cannot answer this is a mistake. Our common sense is more right than a stupid scholar. The creation of God comes loose only by a fate. Everything becomes the material by a conception of God (person).\r<br> \r<br>I cannot prove 1+1 = 2 in a numerical formula. I can prove only a physical phenomenon to say that it is in two apples when I match another one apple with one apple. It is not 0+1 \u2260 1. As 0 (nothing) is not quality, you must not handle it for a number. Because quality is different even if I match a mandarin orange with an apple, there is not a meaning of the addition. Because it does not exist other than God when I define God as existence, no (0) does not exist. Because the mathematics defines 0, negative number, imaginary number, \u221e which do not exist in the world, it is an error and is a fiction. A number is to count quality. When I am separated from a physical phenomenon, the mathematics does not have the significance of being.\r<br>\r<br>\u203bIf 0 exists by a definition of the mathematics, 0 of the infinity must exist. However, the infinite space, infinity do not exist. In other words, because the mathematics defines 0, negative number, imaginary number, \u221e which do not exist, it is an error and is a fiction. Therefore it is an error because a zeta function, the numerical formula of the second oiler product deal with this infinity. That it becomes sum of series \u03a3 = 1+2+3+ ... = - 1/12 of the natural number, or the product of all prime numbers is 4\u03c0^2. It turns out that it is an error if I think for common sense. It is limited, and the mathematician seems to get a wrong this, but uses the sophism when I calculate this endlessly if right. This is a mistake of the definition of 0 or \u221e and is the evidence that mathematics gets a wrong. It is definition f&#39;(x) = limh of the differential calculus that must not divide it by 0 \u2192 0 {the same as it being 0 that says that I bring h close to 0 without a limit, and dividing it by a numerical formula of f(x+h)-f(x)}/h. I divide it by 0. The mathematics is trickery not study in this way.\r<br>\r<br> All the origins of the scientific theory are random, and a bottom is broken. For example, in the theory of elementary particles, an electron joins atoms together and becomes the molecules. A thing joining a proton and a neutron together is a mesotron, and three quarks connect the proton, and there is it. An electron and a positron (antimatter) occur from a photon. An elementary particle to tie the elementary particle to whenever a new elementary particle is discovered is necessary and loses the relations with an elementary particle and the elementary particle more and more. Though a proton and the neutron are the same mass, why does a difference occur in having electric charge or not? The science has no answer with it in these questions. An electron is a material so that I think, and the positron is not a material in the hole of the material loss that the circumference was surrounded by in the soul children. In other words, the antimatter is an illusion. The scholar is going to examine it logically and loses sight of the truth. The structure of built nature of God is simpler, but is the thing which it is hard to understand in the human wisdom. A photon seems to have a particle and the two characteristics of the wave, but, in fact, the light has the property of the wave with the soul body.\r<br>\r<br> Message from the spiritual world of Einstein \r<br> When oneself saw a scene of heaven through a tunnel of the light in the meantime, the person who experienced suspended animation well is you after the revival. The moving speed of the soul does not receive gravitational restraint anymore, and, as for the law of the speed of light immutability that I discovered during the lifetime, there are none in the world of the consciousness. In other words, I will say that it just moves to say that I think. Furthermore, it is just handed down to a partner to have thought. The life of all of us shares what one interiority. And the material is to say that it was actually consciousness. There are all things in your heart, and, also, you are existence to live in a heart of all life. When all of this space watches it with eyes, it is seen like the outside world, but is to say that the world to be actually seen outside is your interiority. The relativity disappears in here, and this space consists based on &quot;universal truth to certainly say to call God&quot;. \r<br>\r<br> Near future to read from revelation and illuminati card of God of days, and to untie it in Japan\r<br> April, 2020 xx day The United States bombs North Korea. North Korea adds nuclear attack to a big city of Japan and a U.S. base as the retaliation. Japan swats it to a bog of the war, and they are dropped by a plot of the United States. There are China, Russia after North Korea and becomes the fight with Japan, American allied powers and drags the world into World War 3.\r<br> x moon xx Japan and the United States country attacks it in Japan with the Allied Forces in 2021\r<br> World War 3 begins in 2021 on xx moon xx day\r<br> Mount Fuji erupts very much on xx day in October, 2023. Major earthquakes occur in a row in all parts of the world. \r<br> An asteroid collides on the earth on xx moon xx day in 2023, and the earth becomes muddy sea \r<br> The world (heaven) of the Maitreya is built on xx moon xx day in 2024\r<br>\r<br> Final note\r<br> The human being denies violence and war, but is it not violence and killing each other I kill a cow pig, and to eat meat? I conquer the world in the life of the hell of the cruel survival of the fittest and am useless even if only oneself is going to be saved. Because a killed animal retaliates for a human being, cancer occurs. The meat which I ate becomes the blood, and a vindictive spirit dwells in a cell when blood does formation to a cell. A human being is cruel, and a fornication, a falsehood, committing theft, the habit of the evil deed of the luxury are not stopped. Eating meat is indirect killing. Why is God that existence of the evil is permitted? It lets you compensate for a human crime by the devil. A disaster, an epidemic, the war damage are the wrath of Heaven. Because a Japanese savior buys the crime of the world people, it is sacrificed. I fall in the trees and plants in spite of the pains then even if I writhe with a hell if it is just and changes the heart and does not straighten an act to measure up to hearts of God. Mason finally leads the world to the World War 3. it is started with nuclear attack to Japan as a pilot light.

Given the range of B and C, A^2 can be equal to any odd integer besides 1. As the square of an odd number is always odd, a Pythagorean Triple can then be generated for any odd integer A. In the past, I specified that generating these Pythagorean Triples for all primes proved that there were infinite triples, as prime numbers are necessarily coprime with each other and thus their full triples are linearly independent, but it would be enough to indicate that B and C are necessarily coprime and thus can&#39;t be simplified to any prior triple.<br>This is very nice to see.

Take the unit circle and intersect it with a line, specifically a non horizontal line with rational slope passing through (0,1)\u2014specifically y=a/b x +1, with a/b in lowest terms.  Furthermore you can assume that 0&lt; a/b &lt;1 (to get a first quadrant second point).  By substituting a linear equation of two variables into a quadratic equation in two variables, the result will be a quadratic equation in one variable.  As the point (0,1) is one of the two intersection points, the other must have rational components.  Specifically that point is ( -2ab/(a^2+b^2) , (-a^2+b^2)/(a^2+b^2) ).  Substitute this back into the circle equation and clear fractions, and you get a Pythagorean triple based on a and b only.  If a and b are relatively prime and are of opposite parity, then the triple will be relatively prime as well.", "comment_date": "2019-08-01T18:26:50Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "H\u01b0ng Daniel", "comment_text": "\u01af\u1edbc g\u00ec t hi\u1ec3u ti\u1ebfng anh", "comment_date": "2019-08-01T08:30:38Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "jeonky.", "comment_text": "my head hurts", "comment_date": "2019-07-31T08:30:02Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Vrushank Vyas", "comment_text": "Amazing!", "comment_date": "2019-07-30T16:52:14Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Matthew Ao", "comment_text": "He literally blew my mind with the animation in the first 15 seconds of the video", "comment_date": "2019-07-30T14:33:10Z", "likes_count": 11}, {"comment_by": "\ub124\uc774\ub9c8\ub974", "comment_text": "\uc774\uac8c \ubb54 \uac1c\uc18c\ub9ac\uc57c \uc528\ubc1c", "comment_date": "2019-07-30T02:40:41Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "\uac15\uc11d\uc6b0", "comment_text": "\uc194\uc9c1\ud788 \u3148\u3134 \uc26c\uc6b4\uac74\ub300 \uadf8\ub9bc\uc774 \uc880 \uc774\uc058\ub124", "comment_date": "2019-07-29T03:01:53Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "\ubc15\uc131\uc6a9", "comment_text": "\ud55c\uae00 \uc790\ub9c9\uc774 \uc788\uc73c\uba74 \uc774\ud574 \ud560 \uc218 \uc788\uc744 \uc904 \uc54c\uc558\ub2e4", "comment_date": "2019-07-29T01:51:32Z", "likes_count": 18}, {"comment_by": "Devansh Tanna", "comment_text": "How do you prove these shapes are parabolic curves??<br>Sir", "comment_date": "2019-07-28T04:02:31Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "\u110b\u110b?!", "comment_text": "<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QJYmyhnaaek&amp;t=14m05s\">14:05</a> \uc640...", "comment_date": "2019-07-27T09:35:58Z", "likes_count": 14}, {"comment_by": "T\u1ea5n Sang L\u00ea", "comment_text": "Omg.. i have go to university for 4 years and study audit.

Furthermore, c is always an odd number that is congruent to 1 modulo 4, meaning if you divide c by 4 you get the remainder 1. There are many other interesting properties but I happened to independently figure these out myself when I was a kid, back before there was Wikipedia or anything like that, just by studying the patterns of Pythagorean triples myself. I didn\u2019t know the term for primitive Pythagorean triples so I called them prime Pythagorean triples, as all of the non-prime Pythagorean triples were simply integer multiples of prime Pythagorean triples. Of course the terminology I came up with back when I was a kid of calling them prime is incorrect, the correct term is primitive, but still, I figured this out when I was in elementary school, I was really into math back then and had a lot of books about it and read things about math not taught at school.<br><br>Also, those lattice points, you can call them Gaussian integers, a Gaussian integer is any complex number whose real and imaginary parts are both integers. It is a useful term, I think, just like the term primitive Pythagorean triple. Anyway, I have not really changed very much since I was a little kid, and am still very much into math.

I responded:<br><br>Oh, he could use this as a way to introduce Galois theory. See, the standard way to derive the quadratic equation is through something called &quot;completing the square&quot;, but there&#39;s a great way to do it through &quot;symmetric polynomials&quot;.<br><br>Say we have a quadratic <i>x\u00b2+bx+c</i> (assuming <i>a=1</i> for simplicity) with roots <i>p</i> and <i>q.</i> (Assume <i>p\u2265q.)</i> It follows that <i>x^2+bx+c=(x-p)(x-q),</i> and expanding that out gives us <i>p+q=-b</i> and <i>pq=c.</i> These expressions, <i>p+q</i> and <i>pq,</i> are known as &quot;symmetric polynomials (in <i>p</i> and <i>q</i> )&quot;, since switching <i>p</i> and <i>q</i> doesn&#39;t change them.<br><br>Now, <i>p-q</i> is not a symmetric polynomial, but <i>(p-q)\u00b2</i> is. There&#39;s an incredible fact that says that every symmetric polynomial in <i>p</i> and <i>q</i> can be written in terms of <i>p+q</i> and <i>pq,</i> and this one is no exception; a little algebra will show that <i>(p-q)\u00b2=(p+q)\u00b2-4(pq).</i> (To derive this, you would start by comparing the expanded forms of <i>(p-q)\u00b2</i> and <i>(p+q)\u00b2.)</i><br><br>Using our above identities, we get <i>(p-q)^2=(-b)\u00b2-4(c)=b\u00b2-4c.</i> Taking square roots, we get <i>p-q=\u221a(b\u00b2-4c).</i> Now, we know both <i>p-q</i> and <i>p+q,</i> and it&#39;s simple to get <i>p</i> and <i>q</i> back. Adding <i>p+q=-b</i> and <i>p-q=\u221a(b\u00b2-4c)</i> together and dividing by two, we end up with <i>p=(-b+\u221a(b\u00b2-4c))/2;</i> subtracting instead and dividing by two gives us <i>q=(-b-\u221a(b\u00b2-4c))/2.</i> This gives us our quadratic formula.<br><br>(Note: I assumed <i>a=1</i> at the start, but it&#39;s easy to go back and do it in full generality. The relevant formulae are <i>p+q=-b/a</i> and <i>p-q=c/a.)</i><br><br>---<br><br>Now, the interesting thing is that <i>this can be used to solve the cubic equation as well!</i> Starting from x\u00b3+bx\u00b2+cx+d, suppose the roots are <i>p, q,</i> and <i>r.</i> Then <i>b=-p-q-r, c=pq+qr+rp,</i> and <i>d=pqr.</i> These are &quot;symmetric polynomials (in <i>p, q,</i> and <i>r</i> )&quot;. Any symmetric polynomial in <i>p, q,</i> and <i>r</i> can be written in terms of <i>p+q+r, pq+qr+rp,</i> and <i>pqr;</i> thus, any symmetric polynomial in <i>p, q,</i> and <i>r</i> can be written in terms of <i>b, c,</i> and <i>d.</i><br><br>Consider a complex cube root of unity. There are two of these (other than 1); one is called <i>\u03c9</i> and equals <i>1/2+i\u221a(3)/2.</i> It satisfies <i>\u03c9\u00b3=1,</i> hence the name &quot;cube root of unity. Its square, <i>1/2-i\u221a(3)/2,</i> also is a cube root of unity. It satisfies the equation <i>1+\u03c9+\u03c9\u00b2=0.</i><br><br>Define <i>S=p+\u03c9q+\u03c9\u00b2r</i> and <i>T=p+\u03c9\u00b2q+\u03c9r.</i> If we know the values of <i>S, T,</i> and <i>-b=p+q+r,</i> then a little algebra can let us find out <i>p, q,</i> and <i>r.</i> (Specifically, <i>p=(-b+S+T)/3, q=(-b+S\u03c9+T\u03c9\u00b2)/3,</i> and <i>r=(-b+S\u03c9\u00b2+T\u03c9)/3.)</i><br><br>Note that swapping <i>q</i> and <i>r</i> switches <i>S</i> and <i>T.</i> Similarly, cyclically permuting <i>r</i> to <i>q,</i> <i>q</i> to <i>p,</i> and <i>p</i> to <i>r,</i> replaces <i>S</i> with <i>S\u03c9</i> and <i>T</i> with <i>T\u03c9\u00b2.</i><br><br>Thus, <i>S\u00b3T\u00b3</i> and <i>-S\u00b3-T\u00b3</i> are symmetric polynomials and can thus be written in terms of the coefficients <i>b, c,</i> and <i>d.</i> Note that <i>S\u00b3</i> and <i>T\u00b3</i> are roots of the quadratic <i>z\u00b2+(-S\u00b3-T\u00b3)z+S\u00b3T\u00b3=0;</i> using the quadratic formula derived above, that means that <i>S\u00b3</i> and <i>T\u00b3</i> can be written in terms of the coefficients as well (plus a square root sign). Taking cube roots gives us the values of <i>S</i> and <i>T,</i> and using the equations above give us <i>p, q,</i> and <i>r.</i><br><br>(This is more of a &quot;method to find the roots&quot; than a &quot;formula for the roots&quot;. That&#39;s OK, since you could use the above to derive the a formula. I really wouldn&#39;t recommend it, though, as ends up really complicated.

The part of the circle which don&#39;t have dots (or the part of the screen which is black, not covered by any of the gray radial line) are angle less likely to be &quot;visited&quot; by a vibrating electrons. They correspond to those angles which produce the simplest shape : 180 for line, 120, 240 for triangle, 90, 270 for square, etc.<br><br>For any harmonic oscillator, there is a stronger tendency to synchronize with an harmonic frequency expressed as an integer with small denominator value : any small n integer value in the rational x/n with x being an integer from 0 to n-1.<br><br>For example, assume a swing with natural frequency of 1 Hz (you need to push your friend 1 time per second to help them increase their oscillation).<br><br>If you are perfectly synchronize, you would push exactly at 1 Hz<br><br>for n = 2<br>If you push at 2 Hz, you waste half your effort.

It is one of the simplest as it requires drawing only one more line and it uses self-similarity. It consists of drawing a straight line from the right angle point to the hypotenuse such that the drawn line is perpendicular to it. The Triangle is thus made up of two smaller right angle triangles that are all similar. Now since the area of any triangle can be viewed as some constant A multiplied by the hypotenuse squared,  and the area of the biggest triangle is equal to the sum of the areas of the two contained triangles,  A x hypotenuse of  the biggest triangle squared = A x hypotenuse of the first inner triangle squared + A x hypotenuse of second inner triangle squared (the hypotenuses of the smaller triangles being the smaller sides of the biggest triangle). Simplifying this (cancelling out the constant A) and replacing the hypotenuses of the smaller triangles with the familiar a, b, and the biggest hypotenuse with c, we get the familiar a^2 + b^2 = c^2.<br><br>You can find it in the intro of the book below.<br><br>Source: Fractals, Chaos, Power Laws: Minutes from an Infinite Paradise (by Manfred Schroeder )", "comment_date": "2017-05-26T18:42:54Z", "likes_count": 6}, {"comment_by": "combatcello", "comment_text": "Thank you for maknig this video, I use this all the time when building with LEGO, and now I know the math :D", "comment_date": "2017-05-26T18:42:47Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "James Durtka", "comment_text": "what&#39;s &quot;you&#39;re&quot; favorite proof :(", "comment_date": "2017-05-26T18:42:35Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Federico Oliveri", "comment_text": "Fuck.", "comment_date": "2017-05-26T18:39:42Z", "likes_count": 104}, {"comment_by": "Alaap Surendran", "comment_text": "Can this also be used as a proof that there are infinite whole number solutions for the Pythagorean theorem?<br>BTW!
