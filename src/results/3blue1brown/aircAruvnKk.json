How about upside -down numbers (my guess: no, you need twice the neurons in the hidden layers)?   And, what about, if/when there&#39;s a break of ink when writing the number (my guess:  no, your NN isn&#39;t learning the concept of continuity, only loops, inflections, and the connection between these two )?  Can it recognize the letters written in a flat tipped (caligraphy) pen? \u00a0How about super-small written numbers that fit, say, in an 8x8 grid of your 28x28 (the only answer can be no)?<br><br>Also, you should have a binary (true or false) in the first layer, rather than a continuous range.  I don&#39;t believe you will be getting any further processing by using a range and instead will be getting spurious values in some (unlikely) input cases.   For example, if the top half is written with light ink while the lower half is written in heavy ink, your network will get confused, unnecessarily.  Use continuous values for photographs, not handwriting, where the ONLY significance is whether the pen is up or down.  <br><br>Also, I don&#39;t think your explaination of what&#39;s happening in the hidden layers is accurate.  To understand what is going on, you MUST preserve the spatial (in this case) relationships in your input data, so that you can figure out the <b>semantic</b> meaning of your next layer.  The same can be done backwards from your output layer:  what would the hidden layer NEED to be to give enough context to generate the output?  Because the two answers are essentially the same, these two hidden layers should be MERGABLE.

has it ever occurred to you that i know better than you, because people learn from there fathers, and then do better, i mean that is what sons do, they learn from thier fathers then do better, it seems to me, that what is happening is an underestimation of knowledge, truly an underestimation of whatever it is that it is that church teaches. ask someone what is wrong, if you see a problem, if you are hurt, say so, if you are hurt, then say so, if you are worried express those fears, if you are unsure, and know you can ask, then do so, if you are like me, and it turns out no one knows you, no one knows you the way you thought, then sadly, just find peace with yourself. because friendship would of been solidfied at the first week, the first month, yes uncertainty, but the conversation goes,<br>dwight: hey did you do something online, with like a journal, like on purpose, <br><br>or like you know go to the lake behind the house, like you did, and ask if i ever meant to realease anything, release anything on purpose? didn&#39;t do it, didn&#39;t tell me anything, instead fka twigs and some dumb stripper shit, yea sabbs suck by the way, good luck with your relationship goals, bitch can dance though bitch can dance<br>money? recongnition? didn&#39;t you find it strange nothing was coming my way, it seems to me that the real problem, is that no one bothered to care in the beginning, and the people who may have some type of caring, by the time they understood, by the time they knew the scale it was too late, but when, and when is the funny thing because i am getting 6 shit and that mixtape came out nearly 7 years ago, sooooo what is it, what are you like trying to get at? because i am still me, still the same person, and now i know no one loves me, and no i am not going to eat worms, unless you count curry chicken worms? which dead black jamicans, maybe, soulless and unrepent even when they are wrong, another earth quote down in the books, or maybe that was light work or misinformation, no black people were harmed in the making of this news story. so earthquake, drake has a plane, and the ugly jenner that sells makeup is a billionare, yea the empire has long since fallen", "comment_date": "2021-08-17T21:36:52Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Felipe Di Gregorio", "comment_text": "Just saw this series of videos and I&#39;m now hungry for more.

You seemed to assume that the number 7 would be more or less centered in the window, so that the horizontal line that forms the top of the 7 could be associated with specific pixel locations.  But you could have a small 7 in the upper right corner, and none of the pixels located where the horizontal line of the 7 is expected would actually light up.  So the system has to be way more sophisticated even just to pick out a 7.  It would need to identify a pattern with a more or less continuous, more or less horizontal, line, surrounded at both top and bottom by blacked out patterns.  And it would need to do that whether the line was long or short, regardless of where it was located in the window, and regardless of whether it slanted a bit up or down rather than being perfectly horizontal.  I can imagine trying to write a formula that would identify such a line, but it would be complicated.  And actual neural networks don&#39;t work by having people figure out such functions, right.  Somehow the machine identifies the relevant pattern.

I suppose my point is, shouldn\u2019t we add some basic rule set to a specific pattern recognition thus if we have a circle with a vertical line to the right of it could be a nine. By using a neural network to identify specific patterns then apply these rule sets, theoretically it would be less complex and more accurate?

Thanks for this video.  it is very informative. people need to stop imagining that AIs have a human imagination. humans have 86 billion neurons, Glial cell, and Astrocytes, and Endothelial cells and and mini-Glial cells and more fun to study where those came from, billions of years of evolution.. Just think with in the average male brain and their 86 billion brain cells, each brain cell  has a different role and 100s of neurotransmitters that double as hormones depending where in the body and which compartment of the brain it is in.. 100 billion is just a super rough number. Fun Fact: the Frontal Cortexx is not fully developed until age 24 or 25.   So do not trust those whippersnapper grasshoppers. i think an AI would have to be developed to populate artificial neurons, to make an artificial human brain to develop deep understanding, which is the next step forward, in our natural progression from AIs to AGI and ASI.

It seems like combining the edges into patterns is mostly a wasted step (for things like numbers and letters, less so for real images, unless an image can be described in terms of it&#39;s edges alone - for full images I&#39;d actually go for edges and colour separately to avoid redundancy of the same edge with a different background colour, as colour only needs one value being stored, compared to all of the values representing edges as a pixel map).  I&#39;d guess the network does store the information in the way you state, just that the weight map is a scrambled version of the weights representing the learnt edges.  Maybe if you were to draw the weight map in a different way, you&#39;d end up with 784 images, each one representing one of the learnt edges, or rather features; pixel 1,1 = neuron 1 weight 1, pixel 2 = neuron 2 weight 1, pixel 3 = neuron 3 weight 1, etc for 784 (EDIT: actually 16, a mistake) separate images (most would probably contain very little??) ??.  You could probably automate the &#39;hand programming&#39; method by drawing by hand on a grid, and every time you, say, add 3 pixels (minimum feature size) you add a second layer neuron with weights from the drawn pixels that activate it (or just use a second layer with only 3 weights per neuron, and assign the three weights as you draw every 3 new pixels - hoping there are enough to take all ten images). For the last layer you&#39;d connect all of the new neurons with weights that activate that one (the one that represents the number being drawn). This would give a lot less connections than a fully connected network, and a lot more neurons, and with all same valued weights, but more closely resembles the &#39;real&#39; wiring and also the way a person learns to recognise numbers (by being shown how to write them,  and you could maybe run the process backward to generate naturally drawn numbers rather than generating by pixel??).  I haven&#39;t tried it though, and it&#39;s just an idea. If it were to work, then you could find a way to optimise the connections afterward to use less neurons, if you really needed to (maybe what dreaming does for a human).  I would say that is what is probably going on in a standard neural network (optimisation), and another reason that the weight values don&#39;t make much sense.  Probably if you were to break the number images down into sections of size, say 3 pixels, then recorded the number of every position (and orientation) that the small sections could fit on the grid, and still be part of the number that they represent, you&#39;d get the number of neurons needed in the second layer if you only used a 3 layer net for this task. The breaking of the image down into lots of smaller pieces is just what a convolutional network does, so the idea is probably close to equivalent.<br><br><br>Sorry about the ??; these represent something my intuition tells me, but has not been tested to see if it works (yet).

The higher or closer the value is to 1, the more probability exists that the image scanned represents that unit cell.<br>    So, a unit cell that contains the highest value is indication that the index of the unit cell is the value of the image scanned.<br>  \u25cb 16 cells in the second and third last cells are arbitrary.<br>  \u25cb Each cell is linked ( causes activation ) to some ( not all ) other cells in the next layer which further cause more activation.<br>  \u25cb Each &#39;cell&#39; corresponds to some sort of identification about how much a certain region &#39;lights up&#39;, and then sends a value to another node which reacts based on the received value. <br>  \u25cb To find whether a certain cell with light us, like each cell be represented by &#39;a Cell_Number &#39;, and let each cell be &#39;assigned&#39; a certain weight &#39;w&#39;. The sum of all the products of each cells &#39;a&#39; and &#39;w&#39; will be:  <br>   w1*a1 + w2*a2 + w3*a3 + w4*a4 + \u2026  + wn*an <br>  \u25cb Let these weighted sums represent some &#39;grid cell&#39;. Each cell is either &#39;on&#39; or &#39;off&#39; with respect to being positive or negative. In this case, &#39;green&#39; represents on, and &#39;red&#39; represents off.<br>  \u25cb Let us concern ourselves to a certain region where the cells are mostly on. Ergo, we would be basically summing up the weightages of those grid cells.<br>  \u25cb Then, if you suppose a region where there are brighter grid cells in some part which are surrounded by dark grid cells, then that area is the main edge we&#39;re looking for.<br>  \u25cb Of course the sum of weightages gives us very different value. In order to &#39;squish&#39; that number line into 0 and 1 , we use the function:<br>   Sigma(x) = 1/(1 + e^-x)<br>  Which is a sigmoid function or a Logistic Curve. Our equation now becomes:<br>   Sigmoid(w1*a1 + w2*a2 + w3*a3 + w4*a4 + \u2026  + wn*an)<br>  \u25cb But what if you don&#39;t always want to light up when it&#39;s a positive value, and rather want it to light up when the weighted sum of that grid cell full fills some condition, such as &gt; 10. This is called &#39;Bias For Inactivity&#39;. Using this example, our equation becomes,<br>   Sigmoid(w1*a1 + w2*a2 + w3*a3 + w4*a4 + \u2026  + wn*an  - 10)<br>   Here, 10 is the &quot;bias&quot;.<br>  \u25cb The possibilities of the different knobs and dials open us to the term of &quot;Learning&quot;, which just means to find the correct relation of values which perform the expected behavior. <br>  \u25cb The complete expression above can be adjusted in the formula:<br>   a(1) = Sigma(W*a(0) + b )<br>   ( (1) and (0) are superscript here )<br><br>   Where W = k*n matrix whose elements are weights corresponding to a cell.<br>   a(0) = n*1 matrix whose elements are the &#39;a&#39; of each cell.<br>   b= n*1 matrix whose elements are the biases of each cell <br>  \u25cb NOTE: Sigmoid function is not used very often now, instead it is replaced by ReLU ( Rectified Linear Unity ), which is defined as:<br>ReLU(a) = max(0, a), a linear function where f(a) = a for a&gt;= 0, which for a &lt; 0, f(a) = 0.", "comment_date": "2019-02-02T20:46:58Z", "likes_count": 696}, {"comment_by": "OverNight", "comment_text": "Anyone else have this this pop up on recommended?", "comment_date": "2019-02-02T16:11:50Z", "likes_count": 2}, {"comment_by": "Aleksandr Khrustalev", "comment_text": "\u043d\u0438\u0445\u0443\u044f \u043d\u0435 \u043f\u043e\u043d\u044f\u0442\u043d\u043e, \u043d\u043e \u043e\u0447\u0435\u043d\u044c \u0438\u043d\u0442\u0435\u0440\u0435\u0441\u043d\u043e", "comment_date": "2019-02-02T12:58:08Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "deweywsu", "comment_text": "You sir, have a gift for explaining the complex in a way people with minimal background can understand.

Ending each sentence with a downward turn of MORE FRY, and as sentences go on, more and more sustained FRY, indicating greater and greater import in what they are saying. Problem is the more FRY they turn on, the more and more, all that&#39;s left is the POPPING of the vocal chords together, and less and less of the other frequencies that illuminate the consonants that articulate the clarifying symbols of the words being said, leaving the listener with more and more occasions of duplicitous words to assemble into coherent meaning.<br>We industrial computer programmers used to say about the &quot;Clarifying Comments&quot; we were asked to embed in our CODE, so that following trouble shooters or re-programmers could more easily understand how the various sections of the programs operated, we would say, &quot;If it was difficult for us to write the code, it should be so much more difficult to read the comments!&quot; <br>In fact, the CODE was so complex, the only ones that could read the code comments, were people who had traveled down almost identical paths as the original programmer, and nobody else could intelligently determine if the original programmer had filled in the commentary correctly, done his job or not. All that anyone really knew was that the program had operated correctly up to the current moment in time, and the future performance was a  vague prediction of past performance. Unknown future conditions would precipitate unknown future results.<br>I offer this explanation in support of the contention that I know of what I speak, and VOCAL FRY, IS NOT AN INDICATOR OF PROFOUND COMPETENCE, but rather is merely &quot;eye wash&quot; thrown in the face of critical observers intending to obscure REAL CRITICAL OBSERVATION of any significant competence, and create just confusion and artificial AWE to others. <br>Interestingly I used the Audio Spectrograph Application loaded on my phone, and I could see the clear articulation and fundamental frequencies of the male speaker, and then watch Lisha speaking, and the more VOCAL FRY she turned on, the more the fundamental frequency of her voice disappeared into the NOISE of the other frequencies created by the FRY, AND THE LESS INTELLIGIBLE HER DISCUSSION BECAME. Visually less and less clear and articulated, and WHERE TO LOOK FOR THE CONSONANTS.....  WOW Very informative. <br>Lisha you might want to MATURE, and get that fixed.

They are excellent! I love the graphical depictions!<br><br>But I do have a comment on not this video but on a possible better strategy to solve the character recognition problem you show here )..While I can see how employing  edge detection might be OK  approach it would seem a better approach would be to  convert the input array into contour lines and the  create  vectors that are tangent to the  contours. .The use the change in slope of these vectors as the thing to recognize. Thus a figure 8 would have very distinct contour lines and then I would  create a vector for each contour whose components are the angles of those vectors tangent to it.,  Those contour lines that  do not run off the edge of the  array would be closed on themselves and thuis traverse 360 degrees, Then I would train my neural net on these  vectors for each contour line. Also, one might use a clustering algorithm to reduce the number of contours so that similar  contour lines could be  consolidated into aggregate contour lines... or something along those lines... no pun intended.<br><br>Also one might break  the contour limes into segments  where  abrupt changes in angle  define segment boundaries and then the segment is reformed  as a new vector that has the normalized  angle vector (0 degrees  = 1, 0  90 degrees  = 0, 1,  45 degrees 1,1, 180  degrees - 1,0) ,etc.) and the segment (normalized) length ( so a  segment running at 45 degrees would be (1,1) (45 degrees with length  =(1,1),1) as its component.  and then use that to train the  neural net.  <br><br>So an 8 vector might look like (barring any typos and such):<br><br>8 = [ ((1 0) 1),  ((1,1), 1), (.0, 1), 1), (.-1,-1), .8),  {the upper right  part of the 8} (.(1,1),1), (,0,1), 1), ((.-1 1), 1) { the lowe right side of the 8),  etc and train on these contour vectors. <br><br>Also one might  do a rotational transform on these  and run a neural net on each rotation but this can be done to those angle vectors where a 1,0  is rotated to be a 11, etc.<br><br>And one might be able to  do all this using multistaged neural nets but generally it seems  their is no one tool does all solution to problems and multiple tools  are best employed. And choosing the right coordinate system is always the  best way to solve any problem and it seems angles not edges are the key to character recognition..", "comment_date": "2018-06-22T09:27:25Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Chloe Fourte", "comment_text": "this reminds me of modular synths", "comment_date": "2018-06-22T03:21:09Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Paulo Roque Silva", "comment_text": "See <a href=\"http://www.vitaliberu.pt/\">www.vitaliberu.pt</a> to know a new paradigm in AI...

A 7-year-old, however, would probably have no clue.  I think the real problem would be making the program&#39;s database TOO big.  If you got it big enough that it would find multiple possibilities, then you would need to then add in probabilities.  Which answer is more likely to show up?  But again, now we are needing to break it into categories.  For example, &quot;5.14159&quot; might show up more often in the medical field than &quot;3.14159&quot; (not saying it does, I don&#39;t know... just saying).

I honestly have no idea why it&#39;s still not common knowledge but my thesis supervisor proved over 15 years ago that:<br><br>1. EVERY neural network with X hidden layers can be transformed into a network with 1 and only 1 hidden layer. There&#39;s absolutely no need to have more than 1 hidden layer. Ever (*).<br>2. The correct number of neurons in this single hidden layer is N &gt;= sqrt(X*Y), where X = number of input neurons, Y = number of output neurons. In your case N should be &gt;= sqrt(784*10) = 89 (**).<br><br>* - you may need to perform something called the &quot;principal component analysis&quot; on the inputs to the neural network<br>** - if the PCA reduces the number of entries (which it does in vast majority of cases), obviously the X is much smaller and in reality you could get your neural network to work with something like 3-6-10 or 4-7-10 neurons.<br><br>Just to give you a real-life example: my master thesis was to analyze 24-hour Holter recordings (you know, the ECG <b>beep</b> stuff you see on the movies) of 100,000 heartbeats of real patients. My goal was to identify all &quot;ectopic&quot; (i.e. incorrect, arrhythmic) heartbeats to help the doctors determine whether a patient suffers from arrhythmia or not. My neural network that achieved 99.7% accuracy was composed of: TWO input neurons, THREE hidden neurons and THREE output neurons (for normal and two types of abnormal heartbeats).", "comment_date": "2018-03-16T21:42:29Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "cloudy forever", "comment_text": "lisha is speaking as if she had in sex with someone, yeahhhh", "comment_date": "2018-03-16T17:47:42Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "jyootimoy kakoty", "comment_text": "hat&#39;s off to you", "comment_date": "2018-03-16T08:58:25Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Raiyan Yahya", "comment_text": "Great Great work !!!

You explained that the activations of the 784 neurons of the first layer are weighted by their shading value and that  the activation values of the 16 neurons in the second layer take on the weighted sum of activations of the first layer. However, there has to be a cost associated with choosing 16 vs 15 neurons. You never explained what was the intent of the 2nd hidden layer, let alone what was its equation with respect to learning which of the 10 values were being recognized (maybe so we would have enough curiosity to see the next video and read Nielsen&#39;s book?).

Neuronale Netze. Ich will Ihren Beitrag nicht kritisieren, aber Bemerkungen m\u00fcssen schon angebracht sein. Bei K\u00fcnstlicher Intelligenz und den Neuronalen Netzen ist bisher immer das Problem, dass die Hidden-Schichten zu wenig sind, es m\u00fcssten in jedem Falle mehr sein, ich arbeite deshalb mit mindestens 6 HiddenSchichten, m\u00f6glichst noch mehr. Da kann es nat\u00fcrlich passieren, dass danach aus den Hiddens nichts mehr rauskommt, aber das Risiko muss man eben eingehen. Google hat ja z.B. f\u00fcr sdeine Hiddenschichten bei dem Spiel Go wohl insgesamt 24 Hidden-Schichten genutzt, und deshalb war das Go-Programm so erfolgreich. Wir arbeiten derzeit in der Gen-Technik an einer K\u00fcnstlichen Intelligenz mit Neuralen Netzen, und dabei sind auch mindestens 12-15 Hidden-Schichten erforderlich, und es klappt. Wie gesagt, wie nach dem deutschen Sprichwort Zu Vilele K\u00f6che Verderben Den Brei so ist es dann auch sicherlich bei den HiddenSchichten, aber 2 oder 3 Schichten ist einfacvh zu wenig und bringt letztlich falsche Ergebnisse.", "comment_date": "2018-01-04T14:26:57Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Eniotna Yssaneb", "comment_text": "How do we get a value between 0 and 1 using the RELU fonction ??", "comment_date": "2018-01-04T13:57:26Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Nancy Wangeci", "comment_text": "Nice lesson for the neural networks .... thanks.", "comment_date": "2018-01-04T13:26:52Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Thomas Kongolo", "comment_text": "Awesome tutorial.

When we learn numbers, nobody assigns a set of criteria used to identify the definition of number shapes. No parent says, &quot;Now Tommy, it has a vertical and a horizontal line, so it could be a 1 or a 7. No Tommy, that&#39;s a T, or is it an L?&quot;.<br>Surely the point is fuzzy self learning, otherwise we&#39;d write algorithms to attempt this?<br>The exact same physical/software NN might be used to understand any number of problems and the point is, it is a black box, we don&#39;t need to know what is happening (how the values are assigned), and often the data is so subtle, it&#39;s difficult to understand anyway! We just give it a method so that it is able to balance itself to give the output that we require.<br>This is proved to an extent by training with the handwriting of a single individual. It would limit the ability to accurately &#39;understand&#39; another person&#39;s handwriting.<br>Admittedly we may need larger/more hidden rows to improve accuracy, but given plenty of samples (and time ;) ) the NN should provide the answers without anyone understanding or caring about its weights &amp; biases, other than from an academic POV. We can set all values to random numbers and then watch it move toward a required output as training progresses, their is no deep understanding required.<br>We can apply NN to problems that we don&#39;t understand, and have the NN succeed without formal training. e.g. spotting cancerous cells within a sample of cells, we just tell it which images have a &#39;bad&#39; cell somewhere, we don&#39;t need to identify the cell. Or self-learning to play video games, where the score is a measure of &#39;goodness&#39;. I see this, I try that and the effect was either good, or not, so adjust weights as required. Jointed robots can learn to move using NN, creating their own gait from scratch, usually they just twitch for a very long time!

I wonder if you could create a neural network trained for the purpose of accurately quantizing colors from an image, to match the original colors that were used. Like in a drawing done in a painting program with brush tools with fuzzy edges, which will intersect shapes drawn in other colors, making areas that are a combination of both colors. You might want only the colors that were originally used to draw those shapes. Once you have a list of original colors, you could hand that information to another neural network to use in defining the shapes and lines drawn in the source image, to be recreated in the output vector drawing.", "comment_date": "2017-10-28T08:16:02Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Operator 801", "comment_text": "You had me by the balls at, &quot;download the code that does this and play with it on your own computer&quot;.<br><br>Gives it to meee!", "comment_date": "2017-10-28T06:22:34Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Johan Surya", "comment_text": "Thank you.

I&#39;ve tried in the past to re-discover the research I read at that time (this was around 1999 probably) but not been successful so far.  <br><br>It was a study where they took animals, primates if I recall correctly, injected them with a dye which would stain active neurons, and showed them black shapes on a white background such that it filled their field of view.  They were able to see, directly, that the shape they saw was literally reflected in their brain.  The neurons which activated in the optical cortex were laid out in the exact same shape as the shape itself.  I always figured it would be messier than that and just look random, but nope, the geometry of what you see is reflected in the geometry of the activated neurons in the optical cortex at the back of your brain.  From there, of course, things get messy.<br><br>It annoys me a little that artificial neural nets are always claimed to be similar to the way the brain functions but there are so many large differences... Like neurons having more than 1 output, learning being a thing that stops, and apparently no concern for &#39;efficiency&#39;... like once you have a 13,002 neuron network that recognizes digits well - can you turn that into a 12,000 neuron network with the same performance?  If you train another network to recognize alphabetic characters, could you then merge the two networks?  I guess the thing that bothers me is that the central dogma of neuroscience - neurons that fire together, wire together - is almost wholly absent.  Sure you get zero weights in places and could argue that is &#39;disconnected&#39;, but the &#39;fire together&#39; part takes timing into account, both the timing of the changing input and the timing of neurons responding to fatigue from over-stimulation and things like that.<br><br>Oh well, fantastic video, I look forward to the others!

Every second, there is about 50 queries and most of these return incorrect information. Multiple brain areas memorize similar information as redundancy.
