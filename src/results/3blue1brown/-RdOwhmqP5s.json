If you pick a point which is on the boundary, within a small circle is a point which, when iterated upon once, will land near a different point near the boundary. If you follow the family of points that do this, you will be able to weed out unfavorable points (which fling off into one of the 3, 4, 5, or whatever regions that&#39;ll converge) and essentially evolve a point which will iterate and bounce around chaotically forever. Each step eliminates a huge number of points, but with an infinite number of points to begin with, you will always have an infinite number of remaining points after each iteration. I like the idea of a point on the boundary which, after each iteration, jumps chaotically to another point on the boundary. Maybe it&#39;s in a cycle of two points, maybe three, or maybe it&#39;s part of the infinite family of points that jump forever in an infinite never-ending chain. At a boundary point, there is infinite sensitivity (we&#39;re probably very close to dividing by zero) which you cannot tell me does not mean there is an infinite family of points, which are all infinitely close together, which each bounce through completely different infinite chains of similar sorts of points.

This means that he was convinced that there is a recurring natural disaster battering our planet. That information can be found in several ancient books that claim that there is a cycle of seven natural disasters. Such a disaster can only be caused by a ninth planet in our solar system. Planet 9 is a frightening planet, therefore it is very well known for thousands of years in the history of mankind. And it is seen in broad daylight with the naked eye, just before our era. We even have pictures of this event. Those disasters are causing a huge tidal wave, massive floods, earthquakes, hurricanes, and a bombardment of fiery meteors every few thousand years. Several animal species become extinct and mankind hardly survives. The only possible natural cause of this cycle can be a ninth planet in our solar system, orbiting our sun in an eccentric orbit. We have pictures of the approaching planet, ancient sources show us the orbit of planet 9 and its whereabouts. Just east of Pisces. And it looks like LL Pegasi, the spiraled cloud, also just east of Pisces. Coincidence?  To learn much more about planet 9, the recurring flood cycle and its timeline, the re-creation of civilizations and ancient high technology, read the e-book: &quot;Planet 9 = Nibiru&quot;.

Although you are wrong about your definition of unsolvability for the 5th degree polynomial and higher polynomials.

Also, we are talking about the GENERAL quintic here, there are special cases with lower degree of symmetry of their Galois group, that are indeed solvable. There are cubics and quartics with lower degree of symmetry as well. Also we can always (mostly rigourously) define ultra radicals and similar things that solve our &quot;unsolvable&quot; polynomials.<br><br>As a side note, i wonder whether the property of all roots attracting points on the boundary is dependent on whether the polynomial is irreducible in rational numbers or not?

This explosion is similar to what happened when we were hitting close to the cubic function&#39;s local minimum, where the function&#39;s derivative was incredibly shallow nearby. That makes the tangent lines nearly parallel to the X axis, which means the next iteration will need to go a very long distance before intersecting the X axis again. Points just slightly to the left of that local minimum will shoot off far to the right, and points just slightly to the right will shoot far to the left.

In this sense we can could describe it as a function that maps all complex numbers to the complex numbers which gets applied over and over again. <br>The areas where this function spreads the points over a wider area are those where the fractal changes from one solid color area to another. If you think aabout it for a second degree polynomial in the real numbers it is easy to see that the points close to the extreme point get mapped all over the numberline because of the very shallow gradient. But still all points on the right get mapped further to the right and all points on the left get mapped further to the left and of course when the gradient becomes 0 we can not map the point at all.. If you extend this to the complex numbers you still get a decision line where all points get mapped towards the side they are already on. But when you add a thrid root it will alter the gradient of the points on this decision line to be pointing more towards the third root but still get spread out over a wider area. So generally points will tend to mapped towards the roots.

I suspect that the explosions must happen near a point where the derivative is zero, and that points close enough to the zero derivative point can map to any point in the complex plane that is more than some distance from the zero derivative point (sort of like how the function 1/x maps (0,1] to [1,inf) ). That means that these mapped points will then be coming from all directions and can therefore reach all zeros. But then, we can make an inductive argument and say that, points near a point that maps to a zero derivative will also have this property as they are only one step away from the explosion.

You could come up with many different and interesting ways to color the particles once they&#39;ve found their final spot in a cluster, for example depending on their location then, on their starting location, on the distance from their &quot;target&quot; root or the origin, etc etc.<br>I feel like it would be super fun and also very educational to write a little program for that and try out different polynomials, color schemes and so on.<br><br>Another idea (which is very similar to what you&#39;re already doing in the video) would be to, for example, put a large number of particles at random locations, let them follow that flowfield and draw the path they take through it.

Generally, 1/P(x) is well-behaved exactly where Newton-Raphson isn&#39;t. Of course, if your objective function isn&#39;t a polynomial, that can go out the window too. The way you partition the region for computing contour integrals also matters, and there can certainly be difficult cases where it&#39;s hard not to drive a boundary through a pole.
