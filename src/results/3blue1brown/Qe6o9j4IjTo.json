Competitive math comes with a pre judgmental mindset where the student is supposed to solve something in a time. This forces the student to focus on quick ways to get the answer by using unintuitive &quot;short cuts&quot; that have absolutely nothing to do with the original concept to begin with, rather than understanding the deeper mechanisms of the concept. worse, some try to cram these methods which inevitably would result in them hating the subject itself. The concept of examination is an old one and is definitely not made with an intention that it is the ultimate method of assessing someone. We need to keep changing it for the better. It needs to evolve. Not only exams but the ways of education itself. As you said, @3Blue1Brown The removal of time limit would make great sense.

Humans can easily visualize at least 5 dimensions by mapping them to X, Y, Z spacial coordinates, a density parameter, and a time parameter. Negative values for density don&#39;t make much sense, but they are manageable for our brains with a little imagination. So to visualize a 5 dimensional function, you just envision an object with varying density in 3d space that changes over time. If you add color with an asymptotic scale, you can even get to 6 dimensions visualized. If someone said to me that humans have trouble visualizing 7 dimensions, that is where I would have to agree that that is where our minds start to lack in visualization capabilities, but quaternions aren&#39;t too bad at all.", "comment_date": "2022-03-18T14:28:06Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "SuicidalShoe", "comment_text": "WAIT.

This ring is Euclidean in every sense except for its lack of commutativity (for example IJ is not equal to JI). The left division algorithm means that this is a principal left ideal ring and therefore every positive integer can be expressed as the square of the absolute value of one of these quaternions, and therefore as the sum of four integer squares (including possible zeroes). This is just like the case of the two-square theorem on the Gaussian integers, except there it was only a certain subset of the integers, not all of them; counterexamples of the form 4S + 3 or 8S + 6 simply due to the fact that 3, 6, and 7 cannot be written as the sum of two squares modulo 8; and in general counterexamples of the form 4^T (8S + F) where F is one of 3, 6, 7.

When I say &#39;explain&#39; what I mean is demonstrate to me why the mechanism existed or how it had to be this way. Calculus, for instance, seemed entirely insane to me. I broke a few tutors because they would go through a series of manipulations for me, which I had no trouble with, but when I asked them how they knew to use those rules or why they used that manipulation, they could never explain it. So, to me, throughout most of my life mathematics was presented as nothing more than a symbol game, like one of those puzzles on a quantitative reasoning test. It made absolutely no sense to me inherently and &#39;math people&#39; just got it, so they could never explain it. It seemed that the formalisms were math, which I found silly, since I could sit down and invent any system of symbol manipulations.

As I began exploring more contemporary fields of physics, i began marveling at the elegance of the pure mathematics underpinning the theory. It was around that time that i also discovered your channel and fell in love with a third field of study. You helped inspired me to pick up a second degree in pure maths and i credit much of my passion and success to your videos and commentary. <br><br>It can be so difficult to look at a black and white textbook and distill out the visual and conceptual intuitions beneath the algebraic and numerical abstraction. I suppose part of the fun of pure maths are those moments of profound insight, when all of the gears mesh together and those insight come forth organically, but it is also quite amazing to see those intuitions and images take such beautiful form on screen. Of the topics I have studied thus far, I have found your animations and explainations to be not only accurate and beautiful, but also essential. You bring life to the essence of mathematics in a way that makes the abstract feel almost concrete. <br><br>Keep up the good work!

In science, we often run into situations that are non-intuitive or dissatisfying but it doesn\u2019t allow us to change the facts right? Like I feel like there must be many real and converging functions that overlap over some range but that doesn\u2019t mean we can just say they are therefore the same over all ranges, yknow? And like i know, we have come across things in science that have allowed us to believe what was said about diverging series, but mathematicians like euler and ramanujan were like totally on board well before there was experimental confirmation. Why? Why were they so ok with this? What am i missing about this whole analytic continuation thing that lets people accept it and be comfortable with it?

I sat and slowly, and at my own pace. Taught myself part of Calc 2 from the book and online videos. At work, on my breaks and lunch, I would go into a conference room or training room and scrawl all over the whiteboards doing homework problems for a class I wasn&#39;t even taking yet. When I hit roadblocks or got the wrong answer, I felt zero pressure and it became a game to find out where I made the mistake or what I overlooked and more times than not. It was an exercise of finding my algebra or even arithmetic errors in my lines and lines of computations. I loved it because for once I was doing it purely because I wanted to (and I wanted to get a leg up on this current fall semester). This made it far more pure to me and thoroughly enjoyable. Though now the fall semester has begun and I am taking Calc 2, at night, 2 nights a week after working a full time job all day. &quot;Embrace the suck&quot; is a very real phrase, and for good reason.<br><br>Pray for me and Grant, thank you. :-)<br><br>PS, Grant.
