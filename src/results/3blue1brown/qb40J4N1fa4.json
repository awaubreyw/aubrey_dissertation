Please tell me if you didn&#39;t understand something from it or if I said something wrong.<br><br><br><br>If you want to nudge both sides of an implicit equation and still be on the graph that the equation defines, the nudges to both sides must be equal to eachother. For example you have an equation y=2x and you take an  point (1;2) as an starting point so your equation will look like this: y=2x&lt;=&gt;y=2*1&lt;=&gt;y=2&lt;=&gt;2=2*1&lt;=&gt;2=2. so your equation ended up 2=2, by replacing y with 2 and x with 1. An different point on the graph, let&#39;s take (2;4), gives us the equality 4=2*2, 4=4, representing point (2;4), in fact, every point that belongs to the graph is represented by an true equality(2=2 or 4=4 or 4,0001=4,0001). If you nudge the first point (point (1;2); 2=2) by an dx and dy( difference in x and difference in y) by, let&#39;s say, both dx and dy of 1, we end up with y=2x; (y+dy)=2*(x+dx);(2+1)=2*(1+1), we get 3=4, which is false, telling us that after an nudge to x of 1 and y of 1 the equation is no more valid, which, obviously, means we are no longer on an point the graph, we, actually, ended up on the point (2;3), which does not belong to our graph. For dy and dx to keep us on the graph, we must have the condition d(y)=d(2x),meaning difference in y (d(y)), must be equal to the difference in 2x (d(2x)), meaning the change to both left and right expressions must have the same quantity for the  equation to remain true(for us to still remain on the graph), for that equality to  still represent an point on the graph. By expanding the condition a little bit, we can leave d(y) as it is for now and let&#39;s first see what that difference to 2x with respect to x is. Which is 2*dx, obviously, because for every little or big difference to x, the expression 2x will double that. So we get d(y)=2*dx. And remember what our condition was? We needed to find a way for both expressions changes to be equal to eachother for it to still represent an point on the graph. And by rearranging d(y)=2*dx, we can divide by dx and get d(y)/dx=2. Which tells us that for every quantity of dy(difference in y), we need it to be twice as big as dx(dif in x), for the equation to still represent an point on the graph. Let&#39;s take our first example, point (1;2), represented by 2=2, y=2x; and our condition said that for every quantity of dy, it must be twice as big as dx, so, for an dx of 2, for example, dy must be 4.(y+dy)=2(x+dx); (y+4)=2(x+2);  for our point (1;2): (2+4)=2(1+2), so we get: 6=6, which is an true equality, so we have jumped to another point on the graph with our nudges dy and dx, which is actually (3;6). And of course, in calculus, we consider very small quantities of dx so the point that we will jump on will be very close to our starting point, so that our different point will show an ratio of dy and dx very accurate for that little zone of the graph that we want to analyze, so small in fact, that we can say that it keeps us on the tangent line to an graph at the first point, for every graph, curvy or very curvy, because limits of course. I gave an simple example so you can see what is happening with an straight line, for which you can say that after an jump of any magnitude to another point you are still on the tangent of the graph, or the graph itself, which are the same in the case of a straight line.", "comment_date": "2022-01-17T14:22:42Z", "likes_count": 3}, {"comment_by": "Deniz Albayrak", "comment_text": "I guess you are one of the best math teacher on the planet, please  keep doing it !!!!", "comment_date": "2022-01-17T11:38:57Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Zack 120", "comment_text": "3b1b: PLEASE improve this video by better explaining implicit differentiation!

Been trying to get into diff eq, and realized that I needed to review implicit differentiation.  The general mechanics of solving implicit derivatives has previously seemed easy, but I think there are more complicated concepts going on under the covers.  You outlined around <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qb40J4N1fa4&amp;t=8m45s\">8:45</a> how 2x(dx) +2y(dy) would need to equal 0 for the second point to be on the curve.  It makes perfect sense.  However, for the early point with which they usually teach implicit diff in a Calculus class, the notion of an infinitesimal on one side of an equation is daunting.  So, they typically teach (d/dx)(x^2&quot;)+(d/dy)(y^2)*(dy/dx)=(d/dx)C.  But this leads to the inevitable - that y is not a function of x, and therefore dy/dx which should only be dependent on only x per the formal definition of derivative, is now dependent on both x and y (because if y is + yield opposing dy/dx from y is -).  And therefor breaks everything from a rigorous standpoint.  Now I see much better that if you accept 2x(dx)+2y(dy)=0 that dividing all by the specific(dx) will solve the problem with established specific positives and negatives for each dy and dx for the given x and y.

Now let me blow Your mind as a physicist. Interestingly, a real ladder moving under gravity on a frictionless floor and wall would have to lose contact with the wall at some point, breaking the equation. The reason is that frictionlessness movement determines that the two contact forces are perpendicular to the floor and wall and the horizontal contact force imparts a momentum on the ladder\u2019s center of gravity in the horizontal direction that accelerates the center of gravity away from the wall. On the free body diagram three forces act on the ladder. Gravity acts on the ladder\u2019s center of gravity and exerts no net momentum on it. The two contact forces do. In fact by a simple geometrical analysis you can see that the center of gravity of the ladder has to describe a circle around the point where wall and floor meet. This is what we call constrained motion. In reality the center of gravity\u2019s motion is not constrained to the circle, only as long as the ladder stays in contact with wall and floor it does. Now we see why at some point the contact with the wall has to get lost. If the center of gravity would stay on its circle, the ladder would arrive on the floor with pure vertical speed, because the circle that the center of gravity describes arrives vertically at the floor. This cannot be, because the horizontal acting wall-contact force has imparted horizontal momentum to the center of gravity, giving it a horizontal velocity away from the wall. So at some angle, depending on the starting angle, the ladder must be losing contact with the wall, namely when the contact force becomes zero. You can compute that angle when you use the kinetic energy of the ladder that arises from its center of mass lowering in height under gravity, when you compute both the translation kinetic energy 0.5mv\u00b2and the rotation kinetic energy 0,5i\u03c9\u00b2, where i is the moment of inertia of a ladder for rotation around its center of gravity 1/12mL\u00b2 where m is again the mass of the ladder and L its length.", "comment_date": "2019-12-16T07:01:40Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Neil McGuire", "comment_text": "Do essence of probability and combinatorics.", "comment_date": "2019-12-15T01:02:33Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "S", "comment_text": "bro these videos just make me even more confused<br>Too much waffling", "comment_date": "2019-12-10T12:07:38Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "\u0420\u0443\u0441\u043b\u0430\u043d \u0414\u0438\u043d\u0438\u0446", "comment_text": "When we don&#39;t have anything to solve the problem, the logic is the only thing that can help us.

Here, of course, y(x) can be multiple-valued function, since with a given x there could be multiple values for y which satisfies the equation.
