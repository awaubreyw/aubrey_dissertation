[{"comment_by": "3Blue1Brown", "comment_text": "There are many questions around contact tracing apps, and I&#39;ll try to address some of them in this pinned comment.  What&#39;s presented is, in essence, the DP-3T algorithm, but needless to say it&#39;s a much-simplified version, so most security-related questions can be answered by going to <a href=\"https://github.com/DP-3T\">https://github.com/DP-3T</a> and reading the full details.  For example, if you&#39;re thinking that when Bob&#39;s phone recognizes some signals in the hospital&#39;s database, it can deduce <i>when</i> Bob met with the someone now known to be sick by looking at where that message shows up on its &quot;What I heard&quot; list, you may be interested to learn how the full details of how these ids are generated and uploaded don&#39;t quite make that as possible as it would be for the simplified version outlined in Nicky&#39;s post.<br><br>One of the biggest concerns is over the efficacy of Bluetooth systems like this.  For example, false positives due to signals shared through apartment walls, and false negatives due to touching a shared surface without ever being near someone.  No one claims that these will catch all contacts, but the goal is to have a system more scalable than in-person interviews, and what you need is for R to stay consistently below 1, not to catch all cases.  Any serious plans for reopening including a system like this also would include other practices driving this reproductive number down, like mask-wearing and distancing where possible.  Also, to the accuracy concerns, it seems worth mentioning that at least one person I know is working on <a href=\"https://www.novid.org/\">https://www.novid.org/</a> which incorporates ultrasound to get a better sense of proximity.<br><br>Many government-issued contact-tracing apps <b>do</b> use GPS in some way, so you&#39;d want to stay informed about whatever specific system is being advertised to you.  The purpose of Nicky&#39;s post is to make clear that contact tracing does not <i>imply</i> location tracking.  If people (or governments) really want to use GPS based contact tracing too, there&#39;s no reason you can&#39;t have both.  But if you&#39;re in a country where people can choose to opt-in, you won&#39;t be including people who are concerned about privacy. <br><br>As to the status of the Google/Apple system, the first phase of their plan involved putting out an API that developers can use to build apps according to these standards, which is now done.  The second phase will involve doing something built into the phone&#39;s OS, which people can opt in to.  For my part, I think the most plausible scenario where we have mass adoption comes something in the OS like this.", "comment_date": "2020-05-14T15:21:11Z", "likes_count": 503}, {"comment_by": "John Doe", "comment_text": "From what I can see, the apps act independently of each other, so how do the devs make sure every code sent by every phone is unique?<br><br>It also relies on voluntary quarantine for contact tracing, which is a bit idealistic to say the least.", "comment_date": "2022-07-24T08:39:49Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Yash", "comment_text": "<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D__UaR5MQao&amp;t=2m09s\">2:09</a> <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D__UaR5MQao&amp;t=6m31s\">6:31</a> The only reason i had NOT installed the contact tracing app by the govt of my country is that it was not open source. <br>and i would never install it as long as it stays closed source and proprietary.", "comment_date": "2022-07-08T09:53:17Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Yash", "comment_text": "[<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D__UaR5MQao&amp;t=5m16s\">5:16</a> - <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D__UaR5MQao&amp;t=5m20s\">5:20</a>] hmm, didnt know what the other terms besides epidemic (so, endemic and contained) were. nice inclusion.", "comment_date": "2022-07-08T09:49:26Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Gianpa", "comment_text": "This did not age well", "comment_date": "2022-07-04T03:02:51Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Rehaan Phansalkar", "comment_text": "&quot;HE often makes these interactive explanations . . .&quot; Isn&#39;t Nicky Case gender nonbinary?", "comment_date": "2022-06-03T06:39:19Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Kratik Agarwal", "comment_text": "I had a doubt regarding the tracking.

This sort of technology is already common in places like malls and shopping centres. Another important flaw with many of the existing apps is that they broadcast the device model name without encryption, which opens up potential stalking and home safety issues: if you know where a person lives and the model of their phone, you can determine whether they&#39;re home or not by listening for tracer app transmissions.<br><br>There are also serious questions about whether the bluetooth approach even works (raised in part by the engineers behind the bluetooth spec). These are relatively low power signals, the received signal strength is used to infer the distance between the devices, and the signal strength depends on factors like the shape of the space the devices are in (which affects the paths that radio emissions can take) and whether there are any radio absorbent objects between the two devices (most notably, the water in your own body will absorb radio in the microwave range used by bluetooth and wifi). Bluetooth radio also goes clean through walls and glass, so you run the risk of false contacts from your neighbours (if in an apartment building) or the folks you were stuck in that traffic jam with. There&#39;s also a major question around false negatives: most tracking apps consider you to have been &quot;in contact&quot; with another after spending 15 minutes together, but you could very easily spend a brief moment near a contagious person running the app.<br><br>All this, and we haven&#39;t gotten to the wider social issues, such as the false sense of security that some might derive from carrying an app that is advertised as &quot;protecting them&quot;, and normalizing the collection of your close contacts by government apps.<br><br>The approach of bluetooth contact tracing apps is a bit half baked, and the potential negative long term consequences are large.

All of these phones will periodically broadcast messages with unique IDs (like the random gibberish). While it broadcasts messages, it will also listen for messages from other phones, such as Bob\u2019s and Charlie\u2019s. When any of these phone receives such a message, it will broadcast it back out, as well as noting that it recently received that message. This way, the phones will keep bouncing the message back and forth. <br>Let\u2019s say Bob leaves after 5 minutes; his phone will stop receiving the bounced message, so it discards it, and nothing happens. But Alice and Bob stay close together for an extended period of time. After their phones have bounced the message back and forth for a certain period of time, they will both \u201clock in\u201d the message, and store it as a contact.<br>A day later, Alice falls ill and tests positive. She uses something like the one-time password to upload her locked-in messages to a server, which Bob and Charlie\u2019s phones check in with every so often. Since Bob locked in the message from Alice (and some others, depending on how long they were in together), his phone will notice the message Alice uploaded matches one of his, and will warn him. However, Charlie\u2019s phone discarded the message and do not lock it in, so it will not notify him.<br><br>So basically, it\u2019s like the one here, except instead of looking for several random messages received in a row to notify a contact, it uses one message bounced back and forth a bunch of times.

If there is an obstacle, such as a human body, then there may be a weakening of 70 dB at a distance of 1 meter, while in an open area it may correspond to 10 meters. Exact numbers vary with objects, signal reflections and so on, says Sven Mattisson.<br><br>One way to get around this is to use additional positioning techniques, such as triangulation.

Accessibility:  This assumes <i>at least</i> 60% of population has phone AND installed the phone AND have it running at the time. While this seems easy to achieve for us who constantly use phone, it might not be if we include elderly population who are not familiar with such technology, and those who has antique phone that has been around them for 10 yrs or so.<br><br>2. Civility: This also assumes that people would voluntarily obey quarantine if they got contact with someone with the virus. Unfortunately, one must assume the worst of humanity exists out there, and they are quite large in number. For example, there were some incidents of quarantine breach in South Korea; people who should&#39;ve been in quarantine for 14 days just...go out and meet people and go to densely populated areas, because, people who think lock-downs are against their liberty would think the same for the quarantine, too. To prevent this, law enforcement should be in place to make sure they are quarantined, otherwise R would not decrease at all despite of these apps. Moreover, those who break quarantine commonly leave their phone in their home and roam around without it, since the phone has your Geo info regardless of the app they installed, and they could be used against them in court for breaking quarantine. In short, <b>the most infectious people might not be carrying their phone at all,</b> making that 60% criteria less realistic.<br><br>So, it sounds pretty unrealistic to me for this to work at all, at least in its current form. There are some ways of tackling this problem, such as giving out devices designed just for this purpose to a lot of people, but at some point this requires involvement of the government to the level some might feel uncomfortable. So, while I think this &quot;invention&quot; has its merits and definitely would improve how we deal with these kind of situation without violating the privacy <i>in the future,</i> we might need to accept that right now it&#39;s either privacy invasion or herd immunity, and start discussing what&#39;d be &quot;acceptable&quot; amount of privacy invasion, just like how we discuss how much tax we pay or how we do the military service. <br><br>And as a side note, please ponder on the following question: if we cannot entrust our information to the government in fear of big brother situation, that means you don&#39;t have any safeguard for such information, and doesn&#39;t that mean that we are already living in such environment? I am not saying you should forfeit your privacy willingly. I&#39;m saying that if you think you fear such situation, which I believe is not an unfounded fear, it is likely that your privacy might already be compromised, the politicians in your country are screwed up, and you need to act up.

This way of doing contact tracking has two main advantages: it doesn&#39;t track your location, and it also doesn&#39;t even track your contacts. The former is self explanatory, but the latter is where it gets interesting. If Alice is infected and uploads her data to a server, no information actually leaves her phone. Even if there is a security breach, the only piece of information the attacker can obtain is that Alice has the virus. Keep in mind here, that that information has to be collected and stored anyway, if we want to contain the virus, whether there is an Anti-Corona-App or not. Even more importantly, if Bob goes to check for contacts, he does not send any information to the database at all. So if you are not infected, you are not giving up any data whatsoever.<br><br>The one thing the App will not, and in fact cannot, prevent is that when you get the notification that you&#39;ve had contact with a positive case, you might be able to deduce who that might be. But this is, as shown above, not a problem of the app, but rather of the situation at hand. If you were found in contact with an infected person via an interview of said person, you could just as well deduce who that might have been.<br><br>So if we want to contain the virus at all, there can always be personal data spilled, in one form ore another.

First, it&#39;s entirely possible to be within Bluetooth range of someone for five minutes without ever coming into contact with them in an epidemiological meaningful way.

If they later test positive, I&#39;ll get an alert that I was a contact, when I wasn&#39;t. Second, without any context to the potential contact, I can&#39;t make an informed decision about whether self-isolation is warranted. Without knowledge of where and when the supposed contact occurred, I&#39;m forced into a binary decision. And that&#39;s not a light decision - self-isolating could put me out of a job, could be a huge burden to my family if I choose to isolate myself from them, and will certainly increase my stress level for the next two weeks, which could actually increase my chance of getting sick even without being exposed.<br><br><br>I&#39;m not advocating for including some sort of geotag in contact tracing apps because that clearly offers a path to abuse. But without any context on what the contact entailed, this seems like it creates more problems than it solves.
