Are you at all interested in making this example relevant to a basic understanding of physics (and not just math)?  The immovable wall is what makes this problem into a &quot;conservation of energy&quot; scenario.  Even deeper: conservation of mass / energy heavily depends on vacuum energy interacting relativistically with fundamental particles (electrons, quarks).  This is why the left wall cannot move.  This is why electrons are spherical (and quarks are &quot;nearly&quot; spherical).  This is also the origin of the unnamed &quot;force&quot; that binds energy into the localized, temporally persistent bound fundamental particles of the Standard Model which are all as spherically perfect and identical in the quantum realm as the constant Pi can make them.<br><br>Newton imposed his own (wrong) geometric ordering of relative positions, velocities, and acceleration.  Acceleration comes FIRST, not the &quot;second&quot; derivative with respect to time.  Acceleration is the engine of locality.  Without acceleration (changes of direction, not necessarily &quot;relative&quot;), time itself does not exist, much less a derivative of something else with respect to time.  There exists ONLY time and energy.  Relativity, like your model, ONLY NEEDS to work in ONE dimension in order to generate spherical bound energy and three dimensional &#39;timespace&#39;.  Grassmann&#39;s outer and inner vector products are all that is needed to detail the mechanism of the conservation of energy.  Even though he intended it as a static model, it shows that energy is conserved by CHANGING DIRECTION, not changing form, and is never created nor destroyed.<br><br>These ideas are part of an online collaboration that solved a 50 year physics problem.

A stupid scholar all overturned this truth and built it to a convenient system of Mason. Thus, the people believe the trickery of the devil than words of God. Darwin&#39;s evolutionary theory, the Copernican theory of Galileo, the theory of relativity, quantum mechanics, mathematics, the medicine of Einstein are all errors. A ghost, a UFO, supernatural power, the miracle of God to be said to be the occult are rather true. A thing and a ghost (God) exist in the world, and space is active by spiritual power (conception) of God. As for God, all things were created by the soul of language. It is clear if I read the Bible. Because the present scholar mixes the logic thoroughly in human wisdom, it cannot arrive at the truth. It is intuitive power to be important. Why does a child seem to be? The thing which cannot answer this is a mistake. Our common sense is more right than a stupid scholar. The creation of God comes loose only by a fate. Everything becomes the material by a conception of God (person).<br> <br>I cannot prove 1+1 = 2 in a numerical formula. I can prove only a physical phenomenon to say that it is in two apples when I match another one apple with one apple. It is not 0+1 \u2260 1. As 0 (nothing) is not quality, you must not handle it for a number. Because quality is different even if I match a mandarin orange with an apple, there is not a meaning of the addition. Because it does not exist other than God when I define God as existence, no (0) does not exist. Because the mathematics defines 0, negative number, imaginary number, \u221e which do not exist in the world, it is an error and is a fiction. A number is to count quality. When I am separated from a physical phenomenon, the mathematics does not have the significance of being.<br><br>\u203bIf 0 exists by a definition of the mathematics, 0 of the infinity must exist. However, the infinite space, infinity do not exist. In other words, because the mathematics defines 0, negative number, imaginary number, \u221e which do not exist, it is an error and is a fiction. Therefore it is an error because a zeta function, the numerical formula of the second oiler product deal with this infinity. That it becomes sum of series \u03a3 = 1+2+3+ ... = - 1/12 of the natural number, or the product of all prime numbers is 4\u03c0^2. It turns out that it is an error if I think for common sense. It is limited, and the mathematician seems to get a wrong this, but uses the sophism when I calculate this endlessly if right. This is a mistake of the definition of 0 or \u221e and is the evidence that mathematics gets a wrong. It is definition f&#39;(x) = limh of the differential calculus that must not divide it by 0 \u2192 0 {the same as it being 0 that says that I bring h close to 0 without a limit, and dividing it by a numerical formula of f(x+h)-f(x)}/h. I divide it by 0. The mathematics is trickery not study in this way.<br><br> All the origins of the scientific theory are random, and a bottom is broken. For example, in the theory of elementary particles, an electron joins atoms together and becomes the molecules. A thing joining a proton and a neutron together is a mesotron, and three quarks connect the proton, and there is it. An electron and a positron (antimatter) occur from a photon. An elementary particle to tie the elementary particle to whenever a new elementary particle is discovered is necessary and loses the relations with an elementary particle and the elementary particle more and more. Though a proton and the neutron are the same mass, why does a difference occur in having electric charge or not? The science has no answer with it in these questions. An electron is a material so that I think, and the positron is not a material in the hole of the material loss that the circumference was surrounded by in the soul children. In other words, the antimatter is an illusion. The scholar is going to examine it logically and loses sight of the truth. The structure of built nature of God is simpler, but is the thing which it is hard to understand in the human wisdom. A photon seems to have a particle and the two characteristics of the wave, but, in fact, the light has the property of the wave with the soul body.<br><br> Message from the spiritual world of Einstein <br> When oneself saw a scene of heaven through a tunnel of the light in the meantime, the person who experienced suspended animation well is you after the revival. The moving speed of the soul does not receive gravitational restraint anymore, and, as for the law of the speed of light immutability that I discovered during the lifetime, there are none in the world of the consciousness. In other words, I will say that it just moves to say that I think. Furthermore, it is just handed down to a partner to have thought. The life of all of us shares what one interiority. And the material is to say that it was actually consciousness. There are all things in your heart, and, also, you are existence to live in a heart of all life. When all of this space watches it with eyes, it is seen like the outside world, but is to say that the world to be actually seen outside is your interiority. The relativity disappears in here, and this space consists based on &quot;universal truth to certainly say to call God&quot;. <br><br> Near future to read from revelation and illuminati card of God of days, and to untie it in Japan<br> April, 2020 xx day The United States bombs North Korea. North Korea adds nuclear attack to a big city of Japan and a U.S. base as the retaliation. Japan swats it to a bog of the war, and they are dropped by a plot of the United States. There are China, Russia after North Korea and becomes the fight with Japan, American allied powers and drags the world into World War 3.<br> x moon xx Japan and the United States country attacks it in Japan with the Allied Forces in 2021<br> World War 3 begins in 2021 on xx moon xx day<br> Mount Fuji erupts very much on xx day in October, 2023. Major earthquakes occur in a row in all parts of the world. <br> An asteroid collides on the earth on xx moon xx day in 2023, and the earth becomes muddy sea <br> The world (heaven) of the Maitreya is built on xx moon xx day in 2024<br><br> Final note<br> The human being denies violence and war, but is it not violence and killing each other I kill a cow pig, and to eat meat? I conquer the world in the life of the hell of the cruel survival of the fittest and am useless even if only oneself is going to be saved. Because a killed animal retaliates for a human being, cancer occurs. The meat which I ate becomes the blood, and a vindictive spirit dwells in a cell when blood does formation to a cell. A human being is cruel, and a fornication, a falsehood, committing theft, the habit of the evil deed of the luxury are not stopped. Eating meat is indirect killing. Why is God that existence of the evil is permitted? It lets you compensate for a human crime by the devil. A disaster, an epidemic, the war damage are the wrath of Heaven. Because a Japanese savior buys the crime of the world people, it is sacrificed. I fall in the trees and plants in spite of the pains then even if I writhe with a hell if it is just and changes the heart and does not straighten an act to measure up to hearts of God. Mason finally leads the world to the World War 3. it is started with nuclear attack to Japan as a pilot light.

We take our prime distribution on the rotating plane out to the point where it has formed the beams of 4 with empty space in between them and occasional gaps in them, and then we twist it. What I mean is we take each coordinate and move it (-n/pi) where n is the data point&#39;s numerical value. So for instance, we would rotate the point for (1) 1/pi degrees clockwise, and (2) 2/pi degrees clockwise, etc, until each prime has been rotated clockwise by itself over pi, where 2 pi would still result in a full 360 degree rotation (as it was in our original plane). I want to see if that generates an order in the gaps of the beams, perhaps forming them into empty spaces between the new beams created in this new visualization. In order to see this, one would have to take the model out to the massive size where it exhibits the beam structure, and then perform a complex operation on the data at that scale, and I don&#39;t have the means to do that. But if it did form some order when operated on in that way, wouldn&#39;t that indicate that the gaps in the primes are somehow intrinsically linked to pi itself? <br>Please, can someone do this?

What if, the shape of each individual galaxy reflects the workings of its math? Its not impossible that we can see other galaxies through the lens of our own but only in a way that is distorted by the perspective of our galaxy in such a way that we can&#39;t see their fundamental nature or how it might differ. I&#39;m unconvinced constants are anything but really slow moving<br><br>wait, neat! How do those numbers correlate with the primes themselves? Like, each dot is a prime, and that x/20,y/280 works as a coordinate system to mark primes. I mean, its a redundant coordinate system, but one nonetheless.

Modulus is becoming more and more common knowledge as use of computers goes up, and using &quot;mod/modulus&quot; and &quot;remainder/residue&quot; in the same term is redundant. You don&#39;t need the remainder of modulus, modulus is already remainder. Using the word remainder/residue then the term should be divide, not mod, its kind of misleading really.

I think that itself shows that each 1 digit end should be 1/(the number of 1 digit primes) of the total primes, though im not sure how to state that specifically. Basically you could make cones of primes stemming from their root primes, and each of those cones should grow at the same speed, at least, I cant think of a reason why they wouldnt<br><br>what do you use for data modeling?

You have a &quot;Prime axis&quot; with 2 &quot;Potentials&quot; put all 3 together and you now have a &quot;closed working system.&quot; If there are any &quot;imperfections&quot; over 3, you get a &quot;cascading force&quot; That will unbalance your &quot;Closed, working system&quot; but once that &quot;cascading force&quot; reaches a number (Which I think I can quantify for you in the next paragraph.) Those forces will act on the mass as a whole to return it to &quot;The prime axis.&quot;<br><br>This &quot;number&quot; as mentioned earlier in my theory, using &quot;base 10&quot; math would be 138, but only because I want you to think in the infinite &quot;potential&quot; of 2&#39;s. The &quot;Fine Structure Constant&quot; of the universe is the measure of electromagnetic forces holding atoms together, this number in base 10 math is 137. 137 is the perfect prime number. There is 1 &quot;Prime axis.&quot; the &quot;3&quot; represents a closed working system, and the &quot;7&quot; shows there is a &quot;Prime axis,&quot; with 2 &quot;Closed working systems.&quot; rotating around a &quot;Prime axis.&quot;<br><br>I believe that once you have a force that overcomes the &quot;Fine Structure constant.&quot; the &quot;Universe&quot; will act to return it to the &quot;Prime axis.&quot;<br><br>I&#39;m apologize if these aren&#39;t generally accepted math terms, I don&#39;t have a Mathematics degree.

They maintain that this would reduce stress on students who are grappling with many uncertainties, including those caused by the pandemic.<br><br>\u201cSetting pi equal to 3 will avoid the need for students to struggle over whether they should use 3, 3.1, 3.14, or even more digits,\u201d offered one source as rationale. \u201dLet\u2019s be honest, there\u2019s no need to go beyond 3 for most applications, so the use of more digits of that irrational number is, well, not rational. Also, where do you tell the student to stop? Some students will become trapped by worrying about the endless string of digits with which they are dealing.\u201d<br><br>While pi would be set at 3 for pre-college students, the proposed bill further mandates that the 3 value also be used by all non-STEM (science, technology, engineering, math) college students. At the same time, students majoring in STEM disciplines can be instructed to use as many digits as the course leader feels appropriate, from the popular 3.14 through 3.14159, or even more. It specifically doesn\u2019t prevent professionals such as engineers, scientists, and architects from using as many digits as they feel are needed.<br><br>Some of the proponents further argue for the single-digital value by saying that using more digits implies that some figures are \u201cmore significant\u201d than others and thus sends a wrong message, in that all digits should be treated with equivalent significance. As one proponent says, \u201cAfter all, who can say that the fifth digit after the decimal point\u2014for pi, that\u2019s a \u20189\u2019\u2014is truly less significant than the fourth one, a \u201c5?\u201d By staying with just 3 alone, we avoid the need to be judgmental.\u201d<br><br>To further bolster their case, the legislators point out that use of 3 for pi has precedent in the King James Bible (First Kings, chapter 7, verses 23 and 26): &quot;And he [Hiram] made a molten sea, ten cubits from the one rim to the other it was round all about, and...a line of thirty cubits did compass it round about....And it was a hand breadth thick....&quot; along with a very similar text in 2 Chronicles 4:2. Therefore, the use of pi as equal to just 3 alone is a time-tested, reasonable approximation that has been used successfully for thousands of years.<br><br>Oh, come now! Quoting California Legislators&#39; ideas as &quot;new&quot;. Rounding Pi to 3 has been standard Engineering Good Practice for centuries. Working out new ideas on a cocktail napkin, back of an envelope, or even a mini-Post-it has always required rounding/truncation to make the calculations fit. We&#39;ve always left the dog-work of forcing it to work to the green newbies in the office, anyhow.<br><br>April Fools?<br><br>Legislators should spend the taxpayer&#39;s money on other things and leave the decisions to use a specific value of Pi to the teachers as they see fit. Let the teachers decide which value of pi the students should use.

While I did not understand the video and its meaning,  I do understand plotting points on an axis and how these points when connected can create pictures.  However, the author says that they only use prime numbers which makes the math more complex and interesting.  How can prime numbers which seem random create such a beautiful spiral design and when zoomed out how the spirals suddenly change to rays.  It leaves one to think could this be done on any type of plane or only on one that is polar? However, the whole video reminded me of a clock and I am glad he explained it in such a way but there again how did it create a spiral.  From my understanding the numbers must be factored within 2 pie.  Also, it is interesting with in the Dirichlet theory is that all the primes are residue of equal amounts and has infinitely many primes.  So what I learned in the end is that all math is important and it leads to more mathematical thought\u2026..then you must dig deeper and learn how it is connected to a basic concept.  Thus the creator of this video urges us to understand the basics and once this is understood to keep growing for knowledge.

Which is only 16.225 degrees away from 360 degrees, since this shortage continues each 6 radians with the x coordinate growing n+1 each time gives a slightly larger curve. As this continues indefinitely you create the spiral shown in the video. As we continue to zoom out of the infinite graph plots using prime numbers only, we create new patterns that are just as elegant and mesmerizing. In the end this is an arbitrary pattern, and just a play on numbers using specific constraints. It is exciting to play with numbers and accidentally find a pattern or new algorithm that can explain some of the chaos within our reality.

Finding such a gap means that the numbers 16 and 15 are cancelled and actual sums are constantly being removed. But this is a child&#39;s game. How come I&#39;ve never heard of it? Do you know of it? Ironically it&#39;s more abstract but still has some kind of function. Maybe I should do a video on it and go really far out and see what gaps are created naturally by adding every two and moving one from the lowest to the highest. I think it&#39;s also slightly interesting that the function of this is very much ruler like. But why do I get the feeling that this might actually seem like Babel to you? I know you probably fully understand this since I did explain it as block game.

After you make modulo operation on it, you will get the answer why 5 lies next to 7 and 11 next to 13 ;) I also encourage to try to investigate this number series as I am hypothesizing that every prime number belongs to it. It also shows some decent features like the numbers wchich aren&#39;t primes are only to be made by a multiplication of 2 numbers which are greater than zero(in the series) or 2 numbers which are not. For example -5 *(-5)= 25 is simply 1+6*4. 7*7=49 is 1+6*8. However if you multiply -5*7=-35 and if you +1 it, it won&#39;t be able to divide it by 6. That&#39;s where modulo comes with help. To make your analysis easier I recommend making 2 subsequent series 5+6*x and 7+6*x. You may find veeeery fancy features while investigating the subject. You are welcome.

What he actually showed is that the sum of the reciprocals of all primes in a given allowable residue class diverges, which proves that there are infinitely many primes in such a sequence.  Incidentally, his tactics also show that these residue classes have the same &quot;density&quot;, but for an alternate formulation of density than the one shown in the video.<br><br>Dirichlet observed this equal distribution numerically and noted this in his paper, but it wasn&#39;t until decades later that this fact was properly proved, as it required building on some of the work of Riemann in his famous 1859 paper.  If I&#39;m not mistaken, I think it wasn&#39;t until Vall\u00e9e Poussin in (1899), with a version of the prime number theorem for residue classes like this.<br><br>In many ways, this was a very silly error for me to have let through.

Instead this illustrates that the driving forces in the universe when it comes to galaxies, star formation etc are electromagnetic in nature as gravitation can not cause such effects. Instead of introducing these known well known forces into astrophysical models, we have a science mafia that insists that unknown particles and hidden forces (called dark matter and dark energy) lead to such phenomena allowing them to build more useless even larger accelerators after LHC failed to produce any piece of such particles, nor is there any other experiment. It would be time for the mathematicians to revolt but unfortunately they are participating in this big scam.

So, the numbers made a spiral arm every time they encountered a number that was close to the denominator of a rational approximation of 1/2pi (that is to say, close to twice the numerator of a rational approximation of pi itself).  But what if we didn&#39;t want to make spirals?  What if we wanted all of our points to be as far away from other points as possible, *in every direction*?  (Why we would need to do this is a point I&#39;ll come back to later.) If you&#39;re making spiral arms, there&#39;s a lot of space in between the arms that&#39;s wasted, and much less space between two neighbors on the same arm.  Is there a way to avoid this?<br>Well, if we want to find a number that gives us no spirals, we need it to have as few rational approximations as possible, (some of you might see where I&#39;m going with this) we can look at continued fractions, since as explained in that Mathologer video, every time you encounter a large number in a number&#39;s continued fraction, you can truncate the sequence there and get a pretty good approximation.  Thus, the ultimate not-close-to-any-rational-number number would have a continued fraction with numbers as low as possible.  Ideally, made up of all 1&#39;s.  This number happens to be (sqrt(5)+1)/2, known as the Golden Ratio.<br>But getting back to why we would need to find points as far away from each other as possible:  Well, what if we were a plant putting out seeds?  We have a chemical process that rotates by a certain amount and then makes a seed.  And we want those seeds to be spread out as efficiently as possible so that they don&#39;t have to compete for resources.  <br>If you&#39;ve heard that the Golden Ratio shows up in nature, this is why.", "comment_date": "2019-10-12T17:11:42Z", "likes_count": 180}, {"comment_by": "Zach Lorge", "comment_text": "i need a better monitor", "comment_date": "2019-10-12T17:02:37Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Joe Wanza", "comment_text": "This all because pi is the wrong way to an infinite point !", "comment_date": "2019-10-12T16:57:23Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "kymion", "comment_text": "I teach 5th grade math.

The other weird pattern that comes outside of the &quot;galaxy&quot; but which is also connected to the galaxy, could just be part of the &quot;empty&quot; space around our galaxy and between other galaxies or at least something that&#39;s made of matter. and maybe the empty lines between of the lines that consist of the prime numbers, could be the dark matter that we don&#39;t know anything about, and maybe even dark energy too. yes this is showing how our universe is made up (kinda)<br><br><br>it could be whats forming our universe the way it is with time. but for what reason? like why is it doing it? why likes this? and, how? I have no idea but the idea of thinking that all prime numbers are matter and all of the unprime numbers are the opposite...that would mean that you, your body, yourself, your consciousness and just your whole reality as a fact, is in this case, the prime numbers. to me, that sounds logical in a way. and to me it &quot;looks&quot; like our whole reality is a simulation. but ofc idk if it means anything that our universe is built this way and/or is a simulation. but its kind of crazy that we already can figure all this out through math condsidereing how short math has existed in our timeline, considering our whole species age, and how fast we are getting smarter day by day. maybe we will figure it all out in the future, and we will understand dark matter and energy. we will be able to use it and we will basically be gods of the universe. if we figure out we are in a simulation this would mean that it had already happened an infinite amount of times before, due to the fact that if we are in a simulation, and we create a simulation of ourselves, that would continue forever. so we are kinda a simulation inside of a simulation and so on. actually, since our universe is so big, and the simulation would be a complete copy of it, just simulated &quot;differently&quot; the simulation would be precise on such an extreme level, that an exact copy of you exists in the simulation too due to the size of our infinite universe. this is because we live in a fractal universe, like in the video with the patterns made out of prime numbers it seems to exist forever. the infinite distance in our universe is so big that there exist infinite versions of you but where the only difference is one out of the infinite chances that you&#39;ve had but didn&#39;t &quot;take&quot; in this life have already happened or is happening or will happen. this kind of proves that life straight said is like a movie, we do not control our reality 100% due to time, we can&#39;t see the future because we are moving with time we can only see our history, and that is what gives us sense in reality. since you think you are in control and control what you do, say and think every day, this is surprisingly not the case, everything has been in one single continuous motion since the big bang, meaning that everything that happens was supposed to happen, since the beginning.<br><br><br>back to focus. I just really hope that we go the right way so that we can advance and develop to a higher &quot;level&quot; of consciousness so that we can understand more of reality in the future, cause holy f we have been dumb like this in a long time, we need to change for the better. money jobs/work, no free time, no real freedom, stupid laws (especially on drugs) school systems, systems just in total, war, and politics might not be something humans need. think about out, every human creation is made out of this way of thinking, this exact mindset (almost). the whole western worlds culture is made out of this mindset, thats why we cant breakthrough and see through the layers. this has effect on all humans, since all contries depends on the same stuff. in some ancient southern american jungle cultures, they seem to know more and connect more with nature, and they dont use any of our, nonsense. scinece is good 100% and this western world way of thinking have helped a lot, but can help even more with the huge bills from war. <br>this whole text is prob confusiong and random enough already now, but to make it even weirder, i find it interesting that psychedelics makes it easier to understand that type of &quot;good&quot; mindset that i was talking about for the future of mankind. hopefully we will start to go the right way really, really soon, cause I want to experience it before I die, I want to be a part of the change.<br><br><br><br>I hope this made sense, otherwise I am going to stop making comments related to the content on interesting science and reality &quot;check&quot; stuff while being high at least.", "comment_date": "2019-10-11T06:20:14Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "TheAdventurersDiary", "comment_text": "IDK, maybe to the same reason why Pi will never have an end?

I always started at the center of the screen and worked my way out because the red pixels were most likely going to be near the screen center in my situation. I realized polar coordinates would be helpful with this expanding search, but every formula I tried made my search spiral too wide as I went out from the center, causing me to miss some red dots on the screen.

the first number is 25, the second is 35. what is interesting about them is if you factorize them they are exclusively divisible by primes equal or larger than 5 our first true prime in the 6n +/- 1 pattern but NEVER 2 and 3. <br>it&#39;s not an odd coincidence tho. it&#39;s the natural order of numbers categorized into 3 neat groups that each have a root prime 1, 2 or 3 and that dictates the order and properties of all members within a group until infinity.<br><br><br>so fundamentaly 1, 2 and 3 are truely special primes or with other words: the first 3 natural numbers are the only primes that literally hit the nail on its head considering the origin of the term prime and truely can be called &quot;the first&quot;.<br><br><br>and this shows why the definition of prime numbers is rather unfortunate. it dilutes the fact that all primes follow 1 in the 6n +/- 1 pattern which is NOT the case for 2 and 3. i mean i&#39;m not saying we should change this definition. it proofed itself and is absolutely okay for applied mathematics. for number theory and research in this area however there should be a disclaimer about the 2 types of primes if anyone is interested to grasp the essence of the prime distribution within the natural numbers.<br><br><br>to come to an end i want to give you all a quote from the pythagorean philolaos that might sound a little dusty to be fair but it&#39;s still current and will be true back then, now and until eternity:<br>&quot;number, indeed, has two proper kinds, odd and even, and a third mixed together from both, the even-odd. of each of the two kinds there are many shapes, of which each thing itself gives signs.&quot;", "comment_date": "2019-10-10T06:52:58Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "ninja bob", "comment_text": "i wonder could this be used by a computer algorithm to find prime numbers faster for encryption?", "comment_date": "2019-10-10T06:37:33Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "abinadvd", "comment_text": "I have &quot;same&quot; results since 2 years...", "comment_date": "2019-10-10T06:29:08Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Jiaji Tang", "comment_text": "Now that we have 8k resolution display please do the next spiral zoom out with the next fractional approximation to 2\u03c0\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02", "comment_date": "2019-10-10T06:28:33Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "John Jon Jhon Jonathan Johnson Jonston Johnstar IV", "comment_text": "the answer is &quot;cuz&quot;", "comment_date": "2019-10-10T06:27:04Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Halicyion", "comment_text": "But, do you believe in \u300cGravity\u300d?", "comment_date": "2019-10-10T06:22:44Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Raihan Nizar", "comment_text": "You&#39;ve made it Grant, 3B1B has made its first clickbait video!!

Seriously. The field of &quot;hacking&quot; is not precisely defined, but well enough, that you have an understanding of what a hacker is doing. At the end you explain, how you discover important bits of knowledge by exploring the world in a curious manner. This is the key to hacking. This is how most of the hackers I know have learned hacking. Hacking is in the very beginnings of what mathematics was a very long time ago. You could say, we are in the middle ages of information security. It is more like alchemy than medicine. So a lot of security measures are called snake oil, because it is equally useless as snake oil as a medicine. In order to get better and learn faster, you simply have to get better in navigating that graph to visit all the important hubs (nodes with a high number of edges).<br><br><br>My life is determined by this curious behavior. I studied information technology and computer science in order to become a better hacker. Using mathematics, physics, computer science, economics and many other scientific fields, I am able to leap forward more and more. I am now at a point, where I turn around and consider all my knowledge, while looking back, to create art. I want to go full circle, touching humanism, languages, arts, music, history and everything else I discover on my way.

Not even gonna try more than a little for the primes.<br>2pi radians makes a full circle, and pi is irrational, each number moves 1/2pi-th around the circle, and moves outwards by a bit. This means that each 6 or 7, whichever way you count it, will gain or lose some fraction of a radian. This offset will cause spirals to naturally form.

As an example: for the prime number 7, I saw that 2x4 and 3x5 (8 and 15, respectively) both have remainders of 1 when divided by 7.  (I skipped 1 and &#39;p-1&#39; since each of these would pair with itself.  In this example, both 1x1 and 6x6 leave remainders of 1 when divided by 7.)<br><br><br><br>A slightly larger example: p=13.  Here, I paired off the numbers from 2 to 11 as follows: 2x7, 3x9, 4x10, 5x8, and 6x11.  In all cases, the product (14, 27, 40, 40, 66) leaves a remainder of 1 when divided by 13.<br><br><br><br>Then I focused on 5x8 ... because 5+8=13.  I saw that no such pair exists for 7, but such pairs DO exist for 5 (2 &amp; 3), 17 (4 &amp; 13), and 29 (12 &amp; 17).<br><br><br><br>I concluded that a prime number &#39;p&#39; has a &#39;special pair&#39;, a &amp; b, such that a+b=p and ab leaves a remainder of 1 when divided by p (i.e., &quot;congruent to 1 mod p&quot;) ... if and only if p is 1 more than a multiple of 4; that is to say, a Pythagorean Prime.<br><br><br><br>Then I dug deeper.  For the first four such primes (5, 13, 17, 29), I found the pairs 2 &amp; 3, 5 &amp; 8, 4 &amp; 13, and 12 &amp; 17.  I saw that no number repeated, and some numbers seemed to get skipped.  Like, I found that 6 could be paired with 31 (6+31=37 and 6x31 = 186 leaves a remainder of 1 when divided by 37).  But, I couldn&#39;t find ANY number to pair with 7 ... or 18 or 21, for that matter.<br><br><br><br><br><br>After some figuring, I looked at the expression n^2+1 for each of these numbers, and found this:<br><br><br><br>7^2+1 = 50 = 2 x 5 x 5 ... no prime factor greater than 7<br><br>18^2+1 = 325 = 5 x 5 x 13 ... no prime factor greater than 18<br><br>21^2+1 = 442 = 2 x 13 x 17 ... no prime factor greater than 21<br><br><br><br>I concluded the following: For any number &#39;n&#39; greater than 1, if n^2+1 has a prime factor &#39;p&#39; greater than &#39;n&#39;, then &#39;n&#39; and &#39;p-n&#39; form the &#39;special pair&#39; for &#39;p&#39;.<br><br><br><br>So for example: 6^2+1 = 37, and since 37-6=31, I have the &#39;special pair&#39; for 37: 6 &amp; 31<br><br>Or take 9: 9^2+1 = 82 = 2 x 41, and since 41-9=32, I have the &#39;special pair&#39; for 41: 9 &amp; 32<br><br><br><br><br><br>I don&#39;t know if there is any practical use for any of this, but it was fun to discover.

In sixth grade and before I was ok at math, got Cs on tests, and so on. During my seventh-grade math class, I realized I could not take math 8, and then I tested out of algebra I. Around the end of that year I became fascinated by watching some people do calculus. The next year I took geometry and tested out of algebra II then at the beginning of the year precalculus so I could take AB calculus and the BC exam (where I got a 5). In the course of that ninth-grade year, I taught myself many of the concepts and methods of multivariable calc, linear, some differential equations, and dipped my feet in a ton of other things. This following year I&#39;ve explored many parts of category theory, abstract algebra, and other pure math. <br><br><br>     I started becoming interested in math and later algebra when a girl explained to me the box method for long multiplication and I got a book about math for Christmas, I think, about unsolved problems. I loved the new symbols and equations, and the power that it looked like they had. Most importantly, realized that it was messily complex and beautiful. With all the things that had just been, invented, it felt like I could too. The whole time I vowed never to use a textbook - to ponder a question and come up with my own answer. That way, everything I knew felt like it could&#39;ve been invented by me, and that I saw not a manipulation of characters, but a universal idea. Sometimes I&#39;d continue to the same thing, like solve the quadratic formula for a month, until I figured it out. No matter how long it took, at some point, in the end, it always comes faster, and I also owe my ongoing love of math to it. <br><br><br>     Another thing I&#39;ve learned. There&#39;s no magic or &#39;thinking outside the box&#39;; all of your actions, in math and life in general, force us to improve our thinking. The way to do that is not by trying to think about some unintuitive thing you&#39;ve never heard of, but using what you already know; it&#39;s about creating clarity of thought, and asking what you know about but aren&#39;t taking into account that&#39;s causing fuzzy thoughts and stopping you. You can&#39;t take into account what you don&#39;t know, only what you do, so think about that thing - on the tip of your tongue - that you are conscious of but can&#39;t think of the words to apply it. It may not be the answer society excepts (at the time, anyway) but it will always serve you best; sometimes, the question you&#39;re starting with is not well enough defined for you to give such an answer, which is after all important since the question along with its context, alone, always tells you what the answer is. <br><br><br>     To anyone reading this, have a nice day!", "comment_date": "2019-10-09T00:46:31Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Asdayasman \u30a2\u30ba\u30c7\u30a4", "comment_text": "Why does pi appear in the resistance between two points in an infinite grid of 1 Ohm resistors?  :(", "comment_date": "2019-10-09T00:45:46Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Chris bell", "comment_text": "i think if you run this in base 12 math it would create lines . instead of spiral.....i think", "comment_date": "2019-10-09T00:45:21Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "NerdyPi", "comment_text": "I want a Dirichlet series.

No one cares. There&#39;s nothing special about plotting (p, p) in polar coordinates. And most of the initial mystery in these spirals resulted from the artifacts that come from dealing with integer number of radians, which is kind of weird. But on the other hand, this kind of play is clearly worth it if the end result is a line of questions that leads you to something like Dirichlet&#39;s theorem, which is important; especially if it inspires you to learn enough to understand the tactics of the underlying proof. No small task, by the way.\r<br>\r<br>And this isn&#39;t a coincidence, that a fairly random question like this can lead you to an important and deep fact for math. What it means for a piece of math to be &quot;important&quot; and &quot;deep&quot; is that it connects to many other topics. So even an arbitrary exploration of numbers, as long as it&#39;s not too arbitrary, has a good chance of stumbling into something meaningful. Sure, you&#39;ll get a much more concentrated dosage of important facts by going through a textbook or a course, and there will be many fewer uninteresting dead ends\u2014but there is something special about rediscovering these topics on your own.\r<br>\r<br>If you effectively reinvent Euler&#39;s totient function before you&#39;ve ever seen it defined, or if you start wondering about rational approximations before learning about continued fractions, or if you seriously explore how primes are divvied up between residue classes before you&#39;ve even heard the name Dirichlet; then when you do learn those topics, you&#39;ll see them as familiar friends, not as arbitrary definitions.
