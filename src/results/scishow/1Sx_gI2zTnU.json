Because I was small for a six year old when, unknowningly, puberty started for me. The entire reason I started on puberty blockers was because my bones were being bombarded with growth hormones, while my growth plates weren&#39;t yet ready, meaning all my naturally produced growth hormones weren&#39;t being used. Stopping puberty at menses wasn&#39;t the most effective, but it let me grab a few more inches.
