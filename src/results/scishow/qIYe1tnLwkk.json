The deposits around Franklin,NJ are the very best in the world,but there are many other places where they&#39;re found. You need a long wave uv lamp like a black light,and a short wave uv,usually made from a mercury vapor germicidal lamp and a filter to screen out visible light,which can get pricey if you go big. One of my favorites in my collection is a 5-color specimen from Franklin: green willemite,red-orange calcite,purple hardystonite,yellow esperite and orange clinohedrite. What makes Franklin minerals so spectacular is two trace elements in just the right proportion:3% manganese and 1% lead activates the glow in a large number of the many types of minerals found there. I encourage everyone to look into them. Both scientifically and aesthetically,the subject can become obsessive.
