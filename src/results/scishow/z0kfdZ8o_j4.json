I think in some cases this could cause a worse<br>reaction to the virus than just your normal immune system having been trained on only dead virus parts.<br>2) As long as the mRNA goes to the right cells, you should be ok, however, if the mRNA ends up in the blood vessels, it is possible that it will go into the cells that line<br>the vessels.  This can be very dangerous, especially if those vessels are in your brain as these cells will then produce the spike protein and your immune system will wreak havoc<br>on those blood vessel cells which could lead to clotting as we&#39;ve already seen some cases of this which caused about 15 countries in Europe to put a freeze on the Astrazeneca vaccine.<br>3) As for me, I plan to skip the vaccine as I don&#39;t see the point of taking an experimental vaccine which targets a virus that has about the same death rate as the normal flu for people in good health and under the age of 70.  <br>As I&#39;m a software engineer, I like to adhere to the old adage if it ain&#39;t broke (my body&#39;s immune system) don&#39;t fix it!  <br>Get your vitamin D and plenty of rest and exercise so your body will be ready to fend off these viruses and your body if healthy certainly will be able to do that without the help of any vaccine.<br>Now if we were talking about something like tetanus which has about 100% death rate then I would gladly take an experimental vaccine...", "comment_date": "2021-04-20T22:41:11Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Based Franklin", "comment_text": "Why do you call vaccines something that basically is a gene therapy?", "comment_date": "2021-04-20T22:38:13Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "jatpack3", "comment_text": "If you have already been infected with cv19 what possible reason could there be to get vaccinated.
