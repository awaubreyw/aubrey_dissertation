It&#39;s understandable that female ornithologists in recent years have been somewhat more likely than male ones to be interested in and focus on female bird song, but that doesn&#39;t prove that male ornithologists are sexist for being somewhat less interested on average, not does it by itself prove that the attention paid to female bird song before was inadequately little, let alone that this alleged insufficient attention was due to sexism. &#39;We&#39; don&#39;t learn about female bird song &#39;only now&#39;; the fact that female birds in the tropics sing was certainly already well-known in the 1950&#39;s, and Wikipedia cites a paper from the 50&#39;s on this topic, pointing out that &#39;these differences have been known for a long time&#39;. And, as the cited 2003 paper states, &#39;female song seems rare in comparison [to male bird song]&#39;, and it adduces this fact, not sexism, as the reason for the long-lasting emphasis on male bird song.

(The \u2018i\u2018iwi or scarlet honeycreeper, Drepanis coccinea.) I am working on getting my research published, so stay tuned for that. I observed female singing, male-female duetting, and even female singing from the nest (which, as described in the video, is something females usually avoid, for good reason).<br><br>Just wanted to clarify something based on what I&#39;m seeing in the comments about &quot;OBVIOUSLY both sexes sing!!&quot; No one&#39;s saying your chickens or your female parrots don&#39;t make noise... The research discussed here is not really about <b>all</b> noises made by <b>all</b> species of bird; when talking about &quot;song&quot;, we&#39;re generally discussing birds from the suborder Passeri, a.k.a. the &quot;songbirds&quot;. And &quot;song&quot; is generally understood as a special type of vocalization, a long, complex pattern of sounds with specific functions related to defending territory and/or attracting or keeping a mate; these complex vocalizations must be learned, similarly to human language. Birds of both sexes in all species also make vocalizations called &quot;calls&quot;, which are generally shorter and less complex, are instinctive rather than learned, and have different functions.<br><br>It is the songs specifically that were assumed to be produced by male songbirds only. More and more we are discovering this is not the case, but in many species males do sing <b>more</b> than the females. Female vocal behavior has also been obscured by the amount of time females spend sitting silently on the nest (in species where this is primarily the female&#39;s job), during the period of time when most species are at their most territorial and the males are often exceptionally loud and visible. Interestingly, species where males and females have the same color plumage tend to have higher rates of female singing, but it is harder to tell the sexes apart and due to pre-existing biases, the singers were often assumed to be male.<br><br>Hope this provides some context. Thank you to SciShow for shining a spotlight on this subject... truly astounding how gender and geographic biases in the research led to such a long lasting misunderstanding of songbird behavior! More and more we&#39;re discovering how much variation and complexity exists in songbird behavior across the clade.", "comment_date": "2020-12-10T19:23:41Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Air Quotes", "comment_text": "Female&#39;s being ignored in scientific studies I don&#39;t believe it!", "comment_date": "2020-12-10T12:47:56Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "HH", "comment_text": "My aunt is a bit of a crazy bird lady (in the best way possible).
