A hyena is about the same size and strength as a North American wolf.  Hyenas are pack animals as are wolves, which is why wolves have not been driven into extinction by bears.  If logic follows that the hyena and the wolf are essentially interchangeable as far as the ecosystem would be concerned, then bears could not have driven them into extinction, since the wolf would also have been driven into extinction with them.  Further reason why bears would not drive smaller predatory animals like wolves/hyenas out of existence is because bears hibernate during the winter when food is scarce.  This places animals like wolves and hyenas at the top of the food chain for at least 6 months out of the year.  It is far more likely that the wolves drove hyenas into extinction.  Personally I believe that God created all things and the reason why you have animals that live nearer the equator being found under a mountain of ice is because there was a huge cataclysmic event, called the flood, and apparently as part of the fun, there were parts of the earth where the water became ice very rapidly, entrapping the animals that were alive in the area.  After the flood waters receded, the geographic areas where ice formed remained ice.  The earth&#39;s climate changed because of the cataclysm.", "comment_date": "2019-06-24T01:22:52Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Dr. Luis Carrasco", "comment_text": "Hyenas are not dogs, they are more closely related to cats.

Or do they just assume given the latitude?  Has the earth&#39;s axis always been the same?  Could the &#39;arctic&#39; been equatorial at the time?  <br><br>Simple questions to answer, the ground would tell with magnetic signatures and other indications that it was ice covered at the time of these hyenas..  i never hear anyone suggest the arctic and Antarctic were ever equatorial, but i still wonder.  They could pbly also tell by the bones if they were adapted to cold or if they were more likely adapted to a warm climate.  <br><br>Ice Ages are clear as to when and where, and the signatures of large masses of ice are unmistakable, so I am sure if they are sayin Arctic Hyenas they are basing that on known facts that the arctic was at the same latitude at the time these guys roamed the area. So i&#39;m pbly stupid to even ask.  Ignorance is bliss<br><br>Kinda cool anyway.
