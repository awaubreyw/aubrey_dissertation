I&#39;m sure you&#39;re not <i>intending</i> to prop up transphobic misinformation, but this is just flat out wrong: the exact thing you immediately go on to &quot;contrast&quot; in mosquitos is true in humans too!

It expresses early in development to determine whether you grow ovaries or testes, and subsequently your chromosomes have NOTHING AT ALL to do with your physical sex.<br><br>In fact, SRY can be transposed to the X chromosome, or fail to express on the Y -- which results in XX men, and XY women, who develop normally and neither they nor anybody else will be aware there&#39;s anything different about them without an actual genetic test!<br><br>It&#39;s exceedingly important not to get this wrong, because the idea that trans people are always <i>at some level</i> our assigned birth sex is the basis of immense institutional transphobia. In fact, it only takes a few months of hormone therapy for all the body&#39;s systems to adapt and behave as though they&#39;d always been in that environment; because genetically, we&#39;ve all got the blueprints for both modes of sexual expression. Major structures may not change shape, but they all start acting like their developmental counterparts (or in the case of the gonads themselves, just shut down and do nothing).", "comment_date": "2022-01-15T12:31:23Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Bruh7/Kamarovsky_KCM", "comment_text": "The yassification of mosquitoes", "comment_date": "2022-01-15T12:28:38Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Mohamed Amine OTMANI", "comment_text": "I think of a feminist movement will be raised in the mosquitoes society.", "comment_date": "2022-01-15T10:56:54Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Wintersong", "comment_text": "You&#39;ve got glitter on your face!", "comment_date": "2022-01-15T09:42:30Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Nunya Bitnezz", "comment_text": "The only good mosquito is a dead mosquito.

Are appalling!<br><br>All, creatures in our biosphere are interdependent to some extent in a plethora of contexts from nourishment and reproduction to habitation and stimuli for adaptation.<br><br>We are still far from identifying all the life forms with which we share the precious, fragile, blue-green jewel we rely upon for life particularly, with regard to the oceans.<br><br>So how can any true scientist possibly claim to understand much less presume qualification to evaluate likely consequences for all species potentially affected by essentially clumsy, ignorant meddling?<br><br>Crustaceans like crabs, prawns and lobsters are essentially aquatic cousins of terrestrial insects and that consideration also encompasses many species of plankton such as krill.<br><br>Krill is a tiny, shrimp like creature upon which a majority of the mighty and majestic whale species are utterly dependent for sustenance so to unintentionally eradiate them would exterminate most of the Cetaceans.<br><br>Carnivores like dolphins, porpoises, seals depend upon plankton because fish and mollusks are dependent upon it.<br><br>Coral polyps, are also plankton feeders.<br><br>Creatures such as sharks and carnivorous whales prey upon seals and penguins so if they disappear so do the other species.<br><br>Hopefully anybody who had not given the subject sufficient thought can now appreciate how a cascade effect alluded to by extermination of mosquito&#39;s could and would probably proceed!<br><br>Mosquito&#39;s and their larvae are an important if not vital link in the food chain for a number of freshwater species such as Dragon flies, water spiders, amphibians and fish.<br><br>Eradicate mosquitos and you eradicate mosquito larvae which, when subject to a balance of probabilities, will almost certainly incur a disastrous cascade effect throughout the food chain.<br><br><br>Small fish eat mosquito larvae, Dragon fly larvae eat small fish, Dragon flies and some varieties of small birds eat mosquito&#39;s and larger bird&#39;s and species like spiders eat dragonflies and even small birds.<br><br>It is highly appropriate to include a brief and ancient poem by an unknown author as emphasis for the applicable principle.<br><br>For want of a nail (mosquito) the shoe (larvae) was lost.\r<br>For want of a shoe the horse was lost.\r<br>For want of a horse the rider was lost.\r<br>For want of a rider the battle was lost.\r<br>For want of a battle the kingdom (of man) was lost.\r<br>And all for the want of a horseshoe nail.
