The other 20,000 species of bees that are not livestock, do have such struggles and some strategies also : for example some ground bees (a group that represents around THIRTEEN THOUSAND species, not just ONE) can make their galeries and chambers up to a metre and a half underground with cellophane-like secretions that enable them to survive in bubbles in floods for example. I am sure you can find more. Sure you mention don&#39;t use pesticides at the end for native bees, but that was just a footnote.  <br>...and the bit about the Florida beekeeper&#39;s colonies surviving a Hurricane was the most unwittingly ironic part. You are probably broadcasting from the famed land of milk and honey, but there was no mention of the fact that honey bees (imported with the Pilgrim Fathers) are not native to the US, unlike the 4000 species there once were. So as much as it was again cute story that this apiarist sold his hurricane honey (ok lol), it&#39;s as scientifically informative as talking about a struggling dairy farmer in Central Park doing their best to save mammals by selling yoghurt.          <br><br>Honey bee hives are not natural environments (tree cavities more often are), and certainly multiple colonies forcibly housed side-by-side is not either. I get that it was a cute story to marvel at what 5 colonies did in an unnatural evironment, but everytime you said THE bees and not THESE bees - in respect of an adaptation that is only actually specific to this species - it is arguable that you continue to water the planted idea that only honey bees are significant. Choice of language is key.<br>Badly chosen, it contributes by default to shielding your subscribers to their probable ignorance about the 99.9% of bee species, that by weight of sheer diversity and numbers, do the majority of the essential pollination of the hundres of thousands of flowering species on this planet. For balance, the story should have begun with what the local populations of native bees probabaly suffered, cooked in the ground or in burnt above-ground tunnels or even snail-shells (if Osmia bicolor is there) and wiped out by the volcano.  Then you could have focussed in on the interesting story.   <br>My rant is over, but please review &#39;Wild Pollinators Enhance Fruit Set of Crops Regardless of Honey Bee Abundance&#39; by Garibaldi et al..
