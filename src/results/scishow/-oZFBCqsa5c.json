Then it entered the circulatory system, again improving the host in order to further its goals..it cleaned up plaque and strengthened the blood vessels reducing circulatory problems. Next it visted other systems and improved each so that both virus and host would live long lives. Lastly it arrived at the reproductive system and discovered that external invaders often caused medical problems for the host which would be detrimental to its plans so it repelled the invaders.

We are facing the most contagious variant, but people are relaxing precautions to keep from getting infected, like wearing a mask.  When I express this concern to people, I get the same response:  Omicron is less likely to make you seriously sick.  Apparently, people are really bad at evaluating risk.<br><br>There are 3 factors determining whether you&#39;ll be hospitalized with Covid-19:  The chance that you will encounter someone who is infectious; the chance that you will be infected by that person; and the chance that being infected will send you to the hospital.  A year ago, the first two factors were much lower than today, and the third was much higher.  Before Delta, the R0 was estimated to be 2.5, i.e., each infected person would infect 2 or 3 others.  Delta had an R0 of 7, Omicron is estimated to have an R0 of at least 10.  So each person with Omicron is likely to infect 4 times as many people as the virus from a year ago.  You are 4 times more likely to encounter someone who is infectious today, and 4 times more likely to become infected if you do, making it 16 times more likely that you will get the Omicron variant.  The Omicron variant is not 16 times less likely to send you to the hospital.  A year ago, a lot of our protection was simply that we were unlikely to encounter someone who was infections.  Now, we are very likely to encounter people who can infect us, most of whom won&#39;t know that they are infected and contagious.<br><br>Over the past two years, there have been several times when we were confidently told that the new case rate was dropping and this indicated the pandemic would soon be over.  Each time, the virus proved that we couldn&#39;t count it out just yet, and it had a new surge.  A new, more virulent version of the virus seems to come along about every 4 months.

I do think, you know, if you have high virus circulation that drives the risk of emergence - you&#39;ve seen that for Alpha that emerged in the UK, we&#39;ve seen that for Delta in India. Maybe less so for Omicron. Will it be more dangerous? Of course, we all hope it won&#39;t. And and based on the evolutionary advantage to a virus, it is more likely it will attenuate. That means will further be associated with less severe disease. Just based on the mere fact that a virus has as an advantage, you have high transmissibility but you don&#39;t also kill your host at the same time. So we&#39;re all hoping for that for the best case scenario so that the next one will be even further attenuated. That said, I think the world needs to be prepared for the worst case scenario. And the worst case scenario would be that, indeed, there could be another bi- recombination that would combine maybe the capacity to have high transmissibility and high mortality.

With USA government officials breaking multiple laws (insider trading, owning stock and not disclosing, making millions upon millions of dollars trading in amounts far in excess of their government salary while also beating the worlds best professional traders as a sideline (as a side note, the best pro&#39;s generally make +20% ish returns each year. USA government officials are making 900%) it&#39;s clear and obvious that there is a ton of money being made by privileged people &quot;in the know&quot; by the 99% of people doing what we are told to do. So privileged in fact that the UK government were having frequent alcohol-fuelled parties in government offices during strict country-wide lockdowns; an embarrassment and insult to the country and nation.  Additional leaked documents explaining in detail how the USA funded covid creation in Wuhan and that the institutes own incompetence lead to it&#39;s &quot;escape&quot; in around September 2019 and instead of raising alarm, tried to cover it up - Donald Trump himself even admitting to these facts (ref 7 News Australia). I explain all of this right now because in the last few days, the UK has announced there will be NO further vaccine mandates, NO further mask mandates, NO further quarantines as well as USA announcing that they will NO longer count covid numbers. It&#39;s as though covid is being brushed under the carpet. So with all of the above taken into account, it appears that covid is not a serious risk at all however, if it is then it would seem more gross negligence on their part. Not to mention Australia focusing on vaccinating very young children while WHO and Pfizer have literature on their websites advising against vaccinating children for a number of reasons. Then with 3rd and 4th boosters not really doing much at all for Israel and the caution of repeated vaccinations in short timeframes creating immunity issues in itself.<br><br>So where do we as individuals obtain true and correct information about this threat to humanity? Regardless of the agendas of our own leaders, where do we obtain information that is beneficial to the 99% of the working world ie us? Because the last two years have shown and explained to us that probably our 2+ years of trust has been misplaced. These are very mentally challenging times and as an individual, no amount of googling, research, reading science forums like reddit is actually been found to have been beneficial to me.

First, though sometimes viruses shift to more virulent less deadly variants, that is not always true. What is true is that the successful variants succeed, and that doesn\u2019t mean less deadly necessarily. Second, though this virus has some repair mechanisms it still mutates wildly. There have already been proposals to name almost 100 subvariants of omicron. Those proposals were rejected. They do reflect the huge variation in Omicron strains. Third, the BA.2 strain now dominant in Denmark is quite different from the wildely circulating BA.1 strains and may well end up forming a back to back wave with BA.1. Fourth, SARS-CoV-2 has moved into other species. One variant moved into mice (anthroponoses) and then returned to humans (zoonoses). That is Omicron. And the omicron strains can and do infect rodents. Delta and previous strains have moved into weasels, mink and other mustelids. They also moved into deer and other ungulates. Cows, sheep, goats and horses are ungulates. SARS-CoV-2 is widespread in deer. They also moved into cats and related felines. All of these represent problems of their own. And they all are reservoirs that may and likely will reseed variants into the human population. SARS-CoV-2 is not going away. And other more deadly versions may arise at any time from other animals. We missed our opportunity to end the pandemic early in 2020. It will now be with us for the long haul. Fifth, omicron invades cells through a different mechanism from delta. It is because of this that upper respiratory infection symptoms are more prevalent. That may be giving the immune system several days head start in building antibodies before lung involvement sets in, reducing the severity of the lung issues; which have been the major killer. But clotting issues appear to be more important as evidenced by greater impacts to children. Also, the spread of the disease is rapid (R0 likely over 100 with no protection in a naive population), and the time to symptoms is shorter, combined with a longer time to death (~3 weeks). Humans are impatient. And as a result this led to a mistaken assessment that the disease is much less severe (mild). It is still severe. Sixth, South Africa reports data as it arrives and <del>back posts</del> data to when it occurred. As a result, the incidence and death curves rose after people mostly quit paying attention to them, wrongly assessing the severity based on the early data. Seventh, the clotting issues that the disease causes are severe when they occur. Eighth, though the vaccines are ill targeted to this variant, and they do not adequately prevent disease, they do greatly reduce its severity. And that too leads to a miss impression about the severity of these variants. Ninth, human immunity to RNA viruses wanes quickly - by design. This is because our bodies choose to forget rapidly mutating virus strains in favor of building new immunity to conserve precious energy and resources. Defenses against things that no longer exist isn\u2019t much use and it is a large burden. Because of this we will require frequently updated vaccines and we will probably need new shots every three to four months. Tenth, this is nothing like the flu. The flu each year starts when birds carrying new variants migrate south spreading these through the air. It\u2019s spread is aided by our moving indoors. SARS-CoV-2 is a much more transmissible virus spread human to human. And it is far more dangerous and deadly than all but severe pandemic flus.
