Earlier this year I was diagnosed type 2 diabetes and my blood sugar was very high, I was recommended to use insulin medication which later have side effect on my health, I decided to stop using insulin medication and was recommended to use Herbal medicine after I read series of testimony of doctor ELINFOH Herbal medicine on the internet, bloggers site and radio stations, I purchased Dr.ELINFOH herbal medicine for diabetes which he sent to my address through a delivery company and I received the herbal medicine within a couple of weeks and the doctor directed me how to use the herbal medicine for 21 days. After concluding the herbal medicine I decided to go for a blood test and my blood sugar was detected to be normal, Today I am diabetes free with no side effects. Contact Dr ELINFOH via email: drelinfohherbalhome@<a href=\"http://gmail.com/\">gmail.com</a> or Call/Whatsapp +2348110492072 for more information.
