Did you know: Magnetic North has moved hundreds of miles in a nearly straight line, has just passed Geographic North and is headed for Siberia on what may be a course for southeast Asia.

Their corporation already estimated to be worth a trillion dollars. Their plan includes replacing fission reactors with theirs since their fusion reactor can provide the steam to the power turbines and be able to transmute the radioactive fuel to useful and profitable nonradioactive elements, elements that will no longer need to be mined from the earth. The first one should be up and running in a year. If this was being faked as some are clamming why would large corporations have already invested in them? Do you truly believe these corporations are that stupid? MIT sees no technical reason why theses fusion reactors can not be up and running in a year or is MIT stupid as well?
