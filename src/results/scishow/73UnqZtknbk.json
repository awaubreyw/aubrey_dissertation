D. Dailey", "comment_text": "That is cool. I knew about the narwal, rhino, rinocerus beetle and rhinocerous hornbill. The narwhal in particular has been agetting more fame and attention. I see stuff in the store with narawals on it. I even have a narawal stuffed animal. A narwhal is a cross beteen a unicorn and a dolphin. So that is two creatures that are very cheerful and popular. So a narwhal is a new spin for a fancy and whimsical creature. I think a horse can benefit from a horn. Stallions sometimes fight for mates. If one of them had a horn, he can stab the other and inflict lots of damage. Then the horned horse can take over a harem more easily. Then he can sire more horned horse babies. Horses have their own spin on the harem structure in that the leader is one of the females, not the male. So if a mare had a horn, it may still benifit. She probably won&#39;t be as violent as a stallion. However it may bee easier for her to take over and lead a herd. The whole fighting for mates things is something deer and antelope do with thier horns. So it makes sense for horses to the same. Even rhinos do this, and they hit really close to home. It would be cool if two unicorns charge at eachother and use thier horns to stab. It is the unicorn version of jousting. It would be even cooler if two unicorns used thier horns to fire magical blasts from thier horns. It is more like a wizard dual or Pokemon battle. It can&#39;t happen in real life, but that would still be cool. <br><br>I have another idea for real life unicorns. This is giraffes. I am very fond of giraffes. I got a lot of giraffe stuffed animals. Giraffes have two knobby horns called ossicones. Male giraffes fight too. They swing thier long necks and hit with the ossicones. Male giraffes are taller than females. I think the benefit is that the extra length of the neck helps the giraffe swing and hit harder. Giraffes have two horns instead of one. This may not seem like a unicorn at first. However there is something else that is. Giraffes have a bloched pattern on thier fur. It can vary. I recently learned that the different kinds of giraffes with different patterns are actually different species. This pattern makes the giraffe look like it has scales, especially from a distance. So Giraffes look like Chinese unicorns, which are called kirin. The kirin of folklore probably came from giraffe sightings.", "comment_date": "2020-09-21T00:06:35Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Neil's Math and Computers", "comment_text": "As Andrew Huang has taught us, unicorns are pink, fluffy, and dance on rainbows.", "comment_date": "2020-09-21T00:04:54Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "mrE365", "comment_text": "As informative and awesome as the episode was, I kinda have to disqualify entries one and two.<br><br>1): Not a horn.<br><br>2): Two horns, bicorn, not a unicorn", "comment_date": "2020-09-21T00:04:05Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Saud Alarifi", "comment_text": "All I got is just like in humans males are ofter horny(er) in the animal kingdom", "comment_date": "2020-09-21T00:02:13Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "emyoswald", "comment_text": "absolutely loving these lisa frank illustrations, and really impressed with the writing team\u2019s restraint from using any variation of \u201chorny\u201d when talking about how these critters use their horns in mating displays :\u2019D", "comment_date": "2020-09-20T23:55:50Z", "likes_count": 13}, {"comment_by": "Nick Lab", "comment_text": "Wouldn&#39;t a fish be &quot;hydrodynamic&quot; instead of &quot;aerodynamic&quot;?", "comment_date": "2020-09-20T23:53:02Z", "likes_count": 2}, {"comment_by": "Sir M.Chops", "comment_text": "Wait wait wait...so Unicorns never existed on Earth?

Perhaps unicorns are born without horns because that would be poky for the mama horse, then they are the only ones light enough to reach certain places where the food they eat has the youth-giving compound in excess, which they store into their horns which get larger and larger. However, for safety, they have to sleep with the rest of the herd, away from where they eat. It is safe for them to venture to get food during the day because their predator is diurnal and if they stay munching for too long they get caught and die. Once they reach a certain size they can no longer travel to the feeding grounds of their youth and they start grazing with the rest of the herd. The compound stored in their horns gets absorbed slowly by their bloodstream until old unicorns resemble normal horses.
