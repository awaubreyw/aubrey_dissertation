Like, Isaac Newton showed that the &#39;thing&#39; that makes apples fall from trees is the <b>same</b> &#39;thing that makes planets orbit the sun: gravity.  He demonstrated that two different phenomena in two different situations were governed by the same underlying principle.&quot;<br><br> So, in the same spirit of there being a significance in the connection of observations to being one underlying &#39;thing&#39;, gravity, the same approach can be extended further.  Consider that there is a range of systems that are &quot;particulate&quot; in nature that we can observe, from atoms and so on to planets and stars and beyond.  <br><br>If we simply suppose the pattern to continue beyond what we can directly observe, particularly that there be smaller particles, and acknowledge the capacity of particles to pass through other particles (neutrinos can pass through the Earth), then we can envision the possibility that there are particles that are locked in orbits around systems orders of magnitude larger to the point where they are caused to move directly towards the center of gravity of the object that they orbit.  But because they are able to pass through unabated, they then pass through the center of the object that they orbit and pass out the other side.  Remaining locked in a gravitational orbit, they are caused to bend back towards the object again and flow into it and out, repetitively, in a Figure-8 orbital structure. <br><br>There are also significantly more quantities of smaller particles than larger systems.  Thus it is reasonable to consider that these particles are not alone in their orbit but travel as a collective that then produce a flow field that, then, is what we call a &quot;magnetic field.&quot;  This notably is strongly supportive of an infinite nature of reality, almost as if the infinity symbol is embedded with this truth.<br><br>Thus we can extend Newton&#39;s thought process further, because truly it is as simple as classical mechanics in an infinite universe where particles can pass through sufficiently larger particles without being absorbed because the probability of them actually hitting any relatively large blocky particles that create large spaces around themselves is small.  <br><br>For instance if we extend it even further can explain gravity.  If the pattern of particles we observe is extended because there is no particular reason for the pattern to stop, then we can suppose there to be smaller particles, and smaller, and smaller.  So small that we are utterly unaware of their existence because in our perception they approach absolute nothingness.  But, in their subtle nature they also exist approach infinite abundance.  Next to them, photons are like black holes.  And they can pass through larger particles unabated.  Due to their subtle nature, they are able to pass through the resistance barrier that photons experience and truly approach an infinite velocity.  These sweep in all directions in the universe, traveling in straight lines because their velocity is so high that they pass through gravitational differences too quickly to be deflected by them. Except the few that get close enough to get pulled into the particles of a system such as Earth.  As a result of this, when one system exists in the flows it experiences a balanced flow, but when multiple systems exist in the flow then they each block a portion of the flows of these particles that <b>would have</b> applied a pressure to the side of the object facing the other object.  So each experience a low pressure that is a function of the distance of separation and each&#39;s mass, i.e. a measure of their ability to block particles from reaching the other system.  <br><br>Ever smaller, and ever larger, particles--as these explanations which do indeed follow the same line of reasoning for why Newton&#39;s was valid--that span a spectrum of infinity (literally) would suggest there to be no significance to atoms for being a requirement of life as their building block.  The odds of us being composed of the singular particle within an infinite spectrum of particles of which life can be composed is zero.  The odds of us being composed of a particle within an infinite spectrum of particles where any can function as the largest building block of an observer is absolute.  This tells us that we see reality based on our particles.  Atoms are not atoms intrinsically, but because we are observers who are composed of that spectrum of particles as our own largest building blocks.  Rather, how a system is observed literally depends on the particles the observer is composed of.  If an observer is composed of particles of the same mass ratio of our atoms to the sun but with respect to Earth, then their actual reality is that Earth is a star.  In the same way when we look at stars and see stars, Earth in their eyes would be a star.  Perhaps quite an anomalous one with all sorts of weird mysteries floating about it, with all the things we&#39;ve put in space.  <br><br>I say all this because that means we can also explain the strong and weak force.  These are said to be responsible for nuclear fusion and radioactive decay, for instance.  However, nuclear fusion importantly occurs when two systems merge to become a new system, releasing a second particle, and always releasing the same amount of energy.  Supernova type 1a occurs when two stars merge to become a new system, where one is stripped of its material and ejected, and these are used as standard candles because they always release the same amount of energy.  In other words, they are the same function on different scales.  <br><br>When a star supernovas, it is said that all of its atoms simultaneously radioactively decay.  Thus, in the same way, a supernova of a star where it is dropping to a lower energy (rather than growing from merging with another system) <b>is</b> radioactive decay.  And we recognize that gravity causes supernova type 1a as well as supernovae in general.  <br><br>Even the increasing rate of redshift per distance in distant galaxies can be explained by gravity.  In the same way of supposing smaller objects we are unaware of, we can suppose there to be larger objects we are unaware of, and larger, and larger,...  And somewhere up the line there are objects so massive that they can influence the light from all galaxies we see.  Especially galaxies where the light travels larger distances so it is exposed to the force for longer durations.  If the object both gravitationally redshifts/blueshifts light as well as causes the flow of light to bend and travel directly towards the object, through, away, and flow in a Figure-8 shape, literally being brought to be part of the object&#39;s magnetic field, then we can recognize some things that would occur in such a case.  There would be local blueshifted galaxies in the direction opposite the object (we see this with respect to the Great Attractor and Shapley Supercluster), there would be less galaxies at nearer distances (we exist near the center of the largest known void in the observed universe of 2 billion lyr across the KCB Void).  <br><br>And a Figure-8 would have radial motion inward and outward that is equal and opposite and so redshift and blueshift from gravity would cancel from radial motion, but because it is a Figure-8 it has an orbital motion each time through a loop, and orbital motion is always away from the object it is orbiting.  Thus, light traveling in this orbit could be gravitationally redshifted per distance and then arrive at Earth from any angle and exhibit an increasing rate of redshift per distance, while producing untold amounts of optical illusions of galaxies where the light is being lensed repetitively and arriving at Earth to the point where we may have already observed the Milky Way from the outside and not realized it to be.<br><br>--Steve, the &quot;Theory of Everything&quot; guy :x", "comment_date": "2022-03-12T02:51:52Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "UFO WATCH UK", "comment_text": "Well, this was very impressive to watch this morning, now my mind is abuzz with Entropy.

But it&#39;s not that time flows ahead because entropy behaves like this or entropy always seems to be increasing in the universe. The sentence said implies a causal or logical explanation, linking why entropy causes time to move in one direction. But thats not true.

No physicist alive or dead (especially dead) can even begin to explain how a simple refrigerator magnet works. Except myself, of course, I will explain: E.g. refrigerator magnets don&#39;t &quot;work&quot; at all i.e. work defined in the scalar context is invalid with permanent stationary magnetism because magnets exert no detectable force while at rest. But if you pull it off if takes force. But then it no longer at rest as all tests of force will do. Therefore, they don&#39;t work ipso facto. So if a magnet attached to a refrigerator isn&#39;t working then why doesn&#39;t if fall off? Inertia is the answer. But what about gravity? Gravity is the acceleration of an object in a trajectory consistent with the center of mass of the affecting object. But since no acceleration occurs, there is no gravity ipso facto. Viz. gravity is as gravity does just like magnetism and everything else, and the idea that anything is not intrinsically what it is doing is the BIGGEST BLUNDER in human history. So why does a magnet stick to a refrigerator? Because it&#39;s a magnet and by definition it&#39;s doing what it must be doing and it does so in proportion to its magnetic properties. Does it make sense? No, but why should it make sense? &quot;Making sense&quot; is a term encoding a presumption of human knowledge. Magnets are magnets simply because they work as magnets and that&#39;s the terrible truth. The implications are obvious. (It&#39;s the same reason why your cursor doesn&#39;t fall off your screen.)<br>Note: Yes, I&#39;ve accounted for friction.

Since entropy is a &quot;measure&quot; of disorder and nothing can be measured to have any definite position or state there is no measurable difference between maximum entropy and minimum entropy. Basically the state of the universe at the beginning. A cyclical universe where the end is the beginning.

That&#39;s all there was, the very initial bit, the entire &#39;universe&#39; was without extent, and the only question which could be answered was &#39;Is there existence?&#39;  The answer was yes.  Beyond that, nothing could be known because there was nothing to know.  From that state, the only operation which is possible is a kind of infinite &#39;splitting&#39; where existence splits and the first distinction, purely abstract in nature, was born.  An infinitude of an infinitely split single bit somehow established spacetime or at least what we perceive as that, and everything else came along as unfolding of that.  To ask what came &#39;before&#39; time is a fundamentally flawed question, as no &#39;before&#39; existed, and it short-circuits our assumed eternal linking of cause and effect.  &#39;Prior&#39; to time means that every event which can occur must have no preconditions, and all possible such events must occur and must occur at an indistinguishable instant of time.  The moment you can say &#39;x happened as a result of y&#39;, you have time.  Or if you can say &#39;x happened before y&#39;, same thing.  You can&#39;t have movement, for example, because it requires an origin location.  You can have transition between states, but only if those states can exist in a superposition because they are guaranteed to both have occurrence.  Very few things CAN happen in a universe without time.  Those which can, do.  And it results in, well, spacetime and everything.<br><br>The fine-tuning &quot;problem&quot; is not a problem.  That is perspective.  Those numbers which we define to be so &quot;fine-tuned&quot; are just an outcome of our human-created mechanisms of understanding mathematics and physics.  It&#39;s meaningless.  What perturbations we would judge to be &quot;unsurvivably gigantic in their implications&quot; even if &quot;small&quot; is 100% a human problem.  The universe is guaranteed to be capable of having us emerge, and that we did is adequate evidence of that.  Do we understand what parameters are necessary for that?  Can we say with mathematical certainty that a form of consciousness could exist as a diffuse gas whose particles interact on scales of millenia?  No, we don&#39;t understand those things and so its nonsensical to ask why the systems we build seem very sensitive to measures we define sensitively.  WE define what &quot;sensitive&quot; even means.  Call a system which can survive a perturbation of the size which looks &#39;fine&#39; to physicists and call it &#39;robust&#39;.  You&#39;ll both be right, and in both cases, you&#39;re only talking about an interpretation of the numbers which is relevant solely to human physicists and not to the wider universe as a whole.<br><br>And unifying GR and QFT wouldn&#39;t get you a &#39;theory of everything&#39;.  It still couldn&#39;t explain complexity.  It would leave out why mathematics is even effective given how much detail we have to throw out (detail which we can PROVE, mathematically, IS capable of completely invalidating our predictions) to make anything tractable.  It wouldn&#39;t give you a theory that could take a description of a chemical compound and give you the phase diagram of interactions of billions of molecules of it, or explain the qualia of human conscious experience and why it is so difficult to understand by even those who live their entire lives enmeshed in it.

I have been scientifically curious since I was a little boy. It\u2019s really refreshing to hear scientists admit that some theories can\u2019t be tested until we learn more about the processes behind them. <br><br>That said, when we look at how much order there is in the universe, is it scientifically unreasonable to apply some of the theoretical concepts we have yet to fully understand, (like how much order there needed to be to establish a Big Bang like concept, or that our wonderfully complex human immune system seemed to be designed to deal with anything thrown at it, etc.) to a theory of creation? It wouldn\u2019t mean that scientists have to stop learning about the amazingly complex processes and theories that exist, just because something was created. <br><br>On the contrary, It seems that this notion would in more ways than not, allow us to wonder about, who this designer is; or even why this creator used certain techniques in creation, to get to certain observable outcomes. Just because we don\u2019t understand a creative process, doesn\u2019t mean we can still search for why this creator/designer would used certain constants like, how gravity as we know it, is used to draw things together? Or, why light has to travel at 300,000 km a second at all times, and things like these. <br><br>I\u2019ve always been curious about why for many in the scientific community, we accept certain values as fact; even though they are theories that with the knowledge and understanding we have today can\u2019t even be tested. But in contrast, it often seems the very notion of a creator is shunned, as if it somehow stops the scientific process. <br><br>So, I guess this question comes from the same curiosity that made me a SciShow subscriber, and occasional patron for years. I\u2019m compelled to ask, does believing in a creator somehow stop science from being scientific? Is there a theory of, I don\u2019t know, \u201ccreativity\u201d or is \u201crelativity\u201d more acceptable because it it exists outside of the creative process? <br><br>As always, I\u2019m looking forward to learning more from your team, and I want to say thanks for all you do for our curious minds. <br><br>Jemonji", "comment_date": "2021-11-08T04:29:35Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Aaron Ludwig", "comment_text": "It&#39;s almost like the universe was designed.", "comment_date": "2021-11-08T03:51:25Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "jimy guitar", "comment_text": "There currently could be a earth like planet with intelligent life 200 billion light years from us.

Physics is a way of modelling the universe, not defining it. The fact that you can model it forwards and backwards is just a sign of how good the model is.

We cannot remember what hasn&#39;t happened, we can model possible outcomes, these are called &quot;predictions&quot;.

It increases as a result of having more space than stuff, so things get spread out. &quot;Laws of physics&quot; do not bind the universe, they are observations. And E=MC^2 is simply a ratio that translates different units that we use for measurement. It IS different whenever we make measurements in different units. The constant is simply what we use to define our units from... like, if space got bigger, how would you know if we all got bigger and so did our rulers, we would measure everything to be the same still, so what would it even mean to say space got bigger? If the speed of light got faster, we would simply have a larger meter or a smaller second, and everything else cancels out. Does this mean the speed of light is constant? No! It means we model it as a constant, and have no way of measuring it otherwise... the forces that make our clocks tick move at the speed of light, so if it got faster, our clocks would tick faster, and our brains would process faster, and things would fall faster, so we&#39;d have no way of knowing... the effects cancel out, that&#39;s all it means.", "comment_date": "2021-11-07T13:27:15Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Ivan Baumann", "comment_text": "Of course we only exist because our universe is suited to our kind of life.

There is also no reason to think that those numbers could possibly be anything other than what they are.  And no, those constants aren&#39;t as precarious as people think.  Changing just one of them drastically would likely produce a very different universe, but changing several a little bit could easily produce the exact same universe we are in now.

Magnetism and gravity are the same thing, movement along the spatial gradient caused by stretching space (gravity) or the spin of particles (magnetism). The inverse square of force means that the space immediately adjacent to it would have the strongest gradient and when in another magnetic field would form a longer gradient resulting from asymmetrical return to spatial equilibrium. Quantum mechanics seems like people who don&#39;t understand that statistics is statistics, but unifying gravity and magnetism is the only unification I can explain at the moment. (Magnetism was explained to me within the context of my theory, fractal funnel theory, and the definition of gravity went from &quot;the force bringing 3 dimensional spatial distortions to their lowest energy 4 dimensional position in 3 dimensional space&quot; to that with the spatial gradient from stretching space making mass require energy to not move along it.

On Earth spacetime flows at the rate we&#39;re familiar with. As you leave Earth, spacetime expands and time speeds up.

Why is it such a struggle for you to understand? Here goes...The ONLY empirical, tangible evidence of Time is change / change events (look around you - earth spinning, you breathing, quarks decaying - all change event series). Change can be quantum or compound, depending on your reference-frame. Time represents TWO distinct contexts of change: 1.The calibration of change (i.e. the dimension of change - hence &#39;rate&#39; e.g. miles PER HOUR - the calibration of change of position aka motion) i.e. Time is to change what temperature is to heat, a dimension/calibration set. Temperature is abstract, heat is real, Time is abstract, change is real; and 2. Time is the collective &#39;flow&#39; of change. Time is to change-events what &#39;River&#39; is to water molecules - a collective term. But, fundamentally the word River is an abstract collective, water molecules are real. Time is a collective abstract, change-events are real - Time, the &#39;flow&#39; of change. Time, one word, two distinct meaning, both reference change. AND THATS TIME EXPLAINED! Where&#39;s the mystery? All change is caused by energy differential (so, no, Time doesnt &#39;cause&#39; anything). Time 1 measures Time 2.

Maybe it was a case of spontaneous symmetry breaking, or a freak event (which, on a long enough timeline is a certainty) decoupling the Higgs from some local minima, but, an extremely homogenous mixture of elementary particles at any standard temperature without much deviation IS by definition very high entropy. At any given temperature, if there&#39;s no room for the internal energy to dissipate, things will mix as much as they can, and the CMBR proves this of that past state. If gravity is pulling on all things in all directions equally, then there&#39;s no room for difference. The crux of all this, is that as the container of the universes&#39; primordial fluid expanded, so too did the phase space for that fluid&#39;s distribution within its container, and the most MINUTE differences in the distribution of mass/energy sent metaphorical snowballs rolling downhill in all directions.
