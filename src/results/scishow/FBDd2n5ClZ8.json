My favourite hypothesis, which wasn&#39;t mentioned here ticks all the boxes for me. We can narrow down the time frame for the bays creation to the ice age which depending which source is used does seem to line up perfectly with with the start of the Younger Dryas Period which was a period during the last age age (12.9 thousand years ago) of a sudden and large drop in global temperatures. Which also corresponds to roughly the time the north American mega fauna went extinct which was blamed on humans over hunting for the most part. Regarding the bays themselves they all share things in common such as forming in sandy spoil along the coastal plane (there are bays found elsewhere, not just the east coast see Nebraska Bays) and not on nearby bed rock, axis direction and elliptical ratio and they have overturned sand dunes on the leading edges and in some cases they actually overlap each other which implies they were all created quickly and within a short time in my opinion which also implies an impact as was one of the mentioned hypothesis. But there&#39;s no physical evidence within the bays which would match what we would see for any kind of meteor impact. Yet, all of the bays axis as you move south down the coast start to always point to the north west which if you plot the trajectories they all converge around the great lakes region which at that time would have been under kilometres of ice. So what if, a meteor coming down from the north east hit the ice sheet around the great lakes (which would not have left an actual crater because it would be impacting ice and the resulting melt would wash everything away also note this would explain a great deal of the great lakes geography). This would have sent millions of ice chunks (of varying sizes) into low orbit trajectories in a radial pattern from the point of impact and those ice chunks would come down at a low angle and when hitting sandy soil would cause an elliptical depression but ice chunks hitting bedrock would shatter and not leave any noticeable depressions. Also, since the impacters here are ice they would melt away and leave nothing but an empty depression to fill in with sand and water. I would also imagine this would be enough to devastate any large animals on the north American continent.  In my opinion this is the best hypothesis since everything observed can be explained by a series of events close to that. There are people far more qualified to explain it but I did my best XD See Antonio Zamora for a much better explanation.", "comment_date": "2022-05-14T09:03:58Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "DarkVoidIII", "comment_text": "I really wish the sponsorship parts didn&#39;t exist.

The TL;DR here is that it wasn&#39;t fragments of the asteroid itself that created these bays, rather it was the ejecta (debris from Earth, or more specifically the ice shelf of the ice age launched by the asteroid as it struck the earth) that was launched up from the impact and came crashing down again. The Carolina Bays aren&#39;t the only such formations in the USA, there are also the Nebraska rainwater basins. If you measure the angle of all these basins (Carolina and Nebraska) you find that they all point to roughly the great lakes area. This suggests the asteroid or comet would have hit the ice shelf around the Saginaw area, launched ice chunks all over the USA and created all these basins. You might be wondering about all the land between the Carolinas and Nebraska that doesn&#39;t have these basins, well the answer is pretty simple if you think about it. The Appalachian mountains are much harder than the soft soil of the east coast and don&#39;t form craters very well, and west of that, the Mississippi River and it&#39;s tributaries have had thousands of years to meander and wash out the basins in the middle.

Then the bays were basically craters mad from ice impacts, which explains the elongated shape and shallowness.

At least in the Australian case, aridity has a big part to play in their formation, actually rather similar to the climatic conditions that promote the formation of badlands, aka, nutrient-poor, easily eroded soils, generally too dry to support decent plant cover that&#39;s occasionally exposed to heavy rain allowing erosive forces to shape them before they dry out again, preventing vegetation from stabilising them.<br><br>Generally in Australian cases, these form most often atop hills and higher land where there&#39;s less surrounding catchment to fill them and most sit in their own little endorheic basins atop these higher land areas. This is important because there needs to be enough catchment and heavy, sporadic rain cycles to fill them and allow the wind/wave action to shape them, but also a small enough surrounding catchment that they do not have regular inflows (which would cause them to spill and drain them, effectively destroying the formation). I noticed in the LiDAR scans that were shown of the Carolina Bays, that they too sit atop higher land areas with little to no surrounding catchment that could potentially erode outlets for them.<br><br>In Tasmania where I&#39;m from, good examples would be lagoon complexes like the Woodstock Lagoons (just west of Longford atop an aluvial ridge), the Ellinthorpe Lagoons west of Campbell Town (in a dry rainshadow valley) and Lake Tiberias near Parattah, the largest of these features on the island. Geological maps tend to refer to these little lagoons with sandy dunes on their eastern shores as &quot;aeolian formations&quot; as wind it the primary factor in their shaping. Worth noting too that most of these will become somewhat saline as, being endorheic, salts eroded from the surrounding land can never leave to the ocean and builds up over millennia. <br><br>On the mainland, especially in the SW of Western Australia, they can often be seen in long chains, marking the routes of ancient rivers. These however had very different starting points, but shaped in the same way. Effectively, ancient rainfall was higher and broad meandering rivers filled the vast shallow valley floors with aluvium. As the climate dried, the rivers stopped flowing and the wind began to move these loose sands into scattered dunes that choked the original river channels. When sporadic deluges would hit the region, the water would be dammed up by the sand and cause ponds to form. These ponds would slowly be shaped by wind and waves into strings of little elliptical lakes.

Parts of Alaska, Canada and Siberia should have similar structures. But they obviously do not. There are all kinds of shapes from perfectly round to totally irregular shapes. The only thing that is extremely rare there is ellipses. <br>Wind can not create patterns of overlapping but otherwise undisturbed ellipses. <br>The length to width ratio of the bays changes depending on them being in horizoltal terrain or on slopes. Also, bays on slopes show clear signs of gravity induced deformation.<br>There is a second field of similar bays in the midwest, generally called Nebraska Rainwater Basins. All bays have a similiar convergence area in the Great Lakes region. <br><br>The theory that fits best to the features of the bays is, they were caused by secondary (debris) impacts after an initial impact on the iceshield that then existed in the Great Lakes region. By cosmic standards these were low velocity impacts (well below escape speed) of very low density objects. That&#39;s why their inclined impacts caused elliptical craters and no circular explosion craters. It also is the reason for finding them only on unconsolidated ground. The low density ice boulders were not able to punch deep craters into the bedrock. <br><br>There are two YT channels of researchers who have been working on documenting features of the bays for many years now. One is Dabbler&#39;s Den, the other is Antonio Zamora. They came to the same conclusion about the mechanics involved. The only thing they totally disagree about is dating. The soil dating is much closer to Dabbler&#39;s Den&#39;s bay dating attempt than to Zamora&#39;s. The theory was also published in several scientific papers in peer review journals for example by Antonio Zamora, by Richard Firestone and others. <br><br>My own idea that could help finding the truth is the following: If the impacts are real, they certainly were strong enough to destroy and totally mix up anything that had been on the surface and several meters underground a split second before the impact happened. If impacts caused the bays, there should not be any undisturbed fossil (or human made artefact) in the soil inside the bays, as deep as the impact disturbed the soil. Every fossil inside the bays should be very much older (buried deep enough to stay uneffected by the impact) or younger than the impact. If several bays were researched for fossils, the same gap in the fossil record should become visible in all of them.<br>I&#39;m not in the US, nor have I any resources to do or finance excavations.
