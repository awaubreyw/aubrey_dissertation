California was created on the (spoon structure) of southern Japan, a Mariana Trench feature. On that spoon shaped structure you can see one portion that drifted off to become the Philippines, the rest of that spoon structure contains the west coast of the US, California&#39;s Central Valley is as visible as the Sierra Nevada and the partial plate east of Nevada The San Andreas is even visible. It was a smaller proto continent then and there was a massive Grand Canyon between the Aleutian tectonic ridge feature and the Mariana trench features which were parallel to each other and were directly atop the Hawaiian islands which was the original Pacific oceanic ridge. Clearly the Aleutians lifted toward the Arctic and the Marian trench systems drifted westward. It is known that the oceanic ridges create the continents on top of them which then calve off from those ridges (eastward or westward) sliding off previous platelets and being carried across the ocean not with just previous platelet structures but also, the oceanic ridges themselves drifting across the mantle; of which Hawaii and the tip of the Aleutians are former remnants of a still active Pacific ridge below Hawaii. Today&#39;s Pacific ridge includes the western coastal, sierra Nevada,  and Cascadia mountain ranges which extends to Mexico. The recent earthquakes in Ridgecrest and the Searles Long Valley in California reveals the tectonic zigzagging such as is seen on the Atlantic ocean ridge and the zigzagging of what is the Greater Pacific ridge from Alaska through Canada. The Cascadian range disappears below Utah because the Colorado Boulder is sitting on top of that subducted mountain range, mid Cascadia; which once traversed all the way through Mexico and into South America. That Colorado Boulder wiped out the dinosaurs (It was a comet 2-3 times larger than what we see) obliterating the landmass and Cascadia between north and south America leaving the Caribbean and Gulf of Mexico to be filled in by the Atlantic ocean. The Colorado Boulder drifted and righted itself upward into its present day place after it obliterated the Caribbean/Gulf region, the crater rim is still partially visible across Mexico and Central/S. America (connecting to South America&#39;s Cascadia ranges) forming a semi circle when you move the continents westward back in time. The entire crater is much larger that the so called Chixculub crater in the Yucatan which is too small to have wiped out the dinosaurs, and the Yucatan&#39;s northern continental shelf is still intact. The tectonic disruption throughout the Gulf and Caribbean is obvious, all the way out to the Antilles. The Yucatan was way out in the Pacific upon the Yucatan foundation west of the Galapagos Islands, it would later drift with Mexico and fuse into north America as well as drifting by gravity into the crater of the Caribbean and Gulf. The missing continental shelf fragment between the Yucatan and Honduras is actually the Tehachapi Grapevine or Garlock fault structure, it fractured during the impact and was likely thrown into southern California as that segment of the Pacific ridge was drifting toward its present day position. South America itself reveals its drifting path upon the ocean floor; so those three or so fingers of mountain ranges in northwestern S. America were formerly connected and align to the Cascades through that obliterated landmass and all the way up to the Cascades terminating near Utah, when S. America was further out in the Pacific. That entire New Zealand structure is South America&#39;s west coast which calved off the western Pacific ridge. Oregon and Washington State were later created upon the Aleutian segment of the original Pacific ridge, and even California&#39;s drift path along the horizontal continental drift lines in the Pacific ocean all align geographically in their drift path. All interesting as hell when one reverses tectonic continental drift and see continental creation and its drift upon the mantle from the oceanic ridges and trench systems.", "comment_date": "2021-02-15T22:33:28Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Passing Wind", "comment_text": "Excellent information well presented thank you.", "comment_date": "2021-02-12T15:42:02Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Bazooka Llama Productions", "comment_text": "you mean the civil war? <br><br>and january 6th?", "comment_date": "2021-01-14T23:46:47Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Olorin Elior", "comment_text": "oh no america is breaking up what do", "comment_date": "2021-01-13T21:09:25Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Elijah Vera", "comment_text": "Hey man geology isn\u2019t the only thing ripping America apart", "comment_date": "2021-01-07T16:03:39Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Slade", "comment_text": "I&#39;m still ok with commiefornia breaking off........", "comment_date": "2020-12-27T14:51:55Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Lichen8404", "comment_text": "Tbh Michigan already barely exists", "comment_date": "2020-12-09T20:07:56Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Jacoby C.", "comment_text": "What if it did would it affect novopangea probably", "comment_date": "2020-11-13T06:39:21Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Megathe", "comment_text": "Balkanized america", "comment_date": "2020-11-12T04:36:08Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Toni Atchison", "comment_text": "I googled and can&#39;t find a single thing about the Illinois microplate.

Do we see greater tectonic, volcanic, geologic, etc. activity during certain times corresponding to climate cycles? Plainly, do plates move more or less or the same during times of glaciation or snowball Earth situations? <br><br>2) Would a supercontinent cycle, or the Wilson cycle, potentially point to a major impact event in Earth&#39;s past? I wonder: Why is it the lighter continental crust groups up? Wouldn&#39;t it be the case that a cooling Earth early on would have a more even distribution of oceanic and continental crusts? OR<br><br>3) Is the time scale for geologic activity so long that maybe Earth is still working out the kinks, so to speak? Are we still in the midst of the formation of Earth?
