It was absolutely fascinating and incredibly beautiful. They had help from the Japanese prof and his assistant to find a fish who was about to start creating the &#39;bowl&#39; and helped them set up a camera directly above it. The time-lapse was out of this world!<br><br>Further series of Attenborough&#39;s showed that the prairie dog entrances to the tunnels have slightly different shapes at each end. The one is designed to help funnel the air down and the other to suck the stale air out. He demonstrated it with a harmless smoke from a special candle. Within a minute or so of having placed the candle in the first entrance, smoke could be seen coming out of the other (they were pretty close to each other in this case).<br><br>Though it was fascinating to see the great bower bird and his trick with perspective (so much for bird brained, eh?) my favourite bower bird is the Vogelkop (I think it&#39;s spelt that way). It&#39;s the one that builds the &#39;gallery&#39; - some of which are passed down and are decades old. Some are so big that the birds find the appropriate stick (in length and strength) and uses it as a weight-bearing prop! <br>Each bird has his own taste in art - it&#39;s the only logical explanation, not an anthropomorphic description - and collects flowers, berries, bug wing cases and anything else it can which fits with his d\u00e9cor. He&#39;s also a very good mimic of other birds (not quite the famous lyre bird, but close). On realising that a female is near, he&#39;ll pop into his bower, which is neither his nest nor a roost, and will go towards the back where he starts calling out in &#39;bower bird&#39; and other bird &#39;languages&#39;. The bowers are designed in such a way that they echo! The females tour the galleries (there are often a number in a reasonably short distance) and choose the one who&#39;s impressed them the most. They mate in the bower, then off she goes. She doesn&#39;t need a male to help raise the chick as they are only found in PNG (IIRC - maybe N Australia where other bowers are found, but I don&#39;t think so), which is tropical and so has plenty of food for a bird.<br><br>There are countless cases of animals building various constructions. Some are homes (often only for the babies, such as the wasps who create the papier m\u00e2ch\u00e9 hexagonal cells for each larva, processing wood to get the materials. The &#39;guide fish&#39; and blind shrimp work as a team - the shrimp digs out a large, complex tunnel and the fish stays on guard, even retrieving the shrimp if it&#39;s strayed too far to get food!
