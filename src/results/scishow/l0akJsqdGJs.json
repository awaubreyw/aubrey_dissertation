Unusual to get a really clear parasite-to-symbiont-to-inherited cell happening in reverse, but it gets less weird the more you realize that things like asexual reproduction, parasitism, lateral gene transfer, parasites manipulating host DNA and spontaneous DNA loss/gain following cell reproduction are all extremely common factors of evolution across life on earth and are actually heavily favoured by natural selection.

Except a few of our cells, which produce telomerase... an enzyme that replaces the bit of telomere when it reproduces, thus it doesn&#39;t get any shorter, thus there is no limit to the number of times it can reproduce.    Cancer is a somatic cell which, for a number of reasons (including producing telomerase), is functioning FAR better than the surrounding cells, which saps away nutrients and eventually kills the rest of the body that can&#39;t keep up with it.<br><br>If humanity (Until Noah&#39;s generation) used to have the genetic instructions for the controlled production and use of telomerase... humans living 900 years would be obvious.<br><br>In Genesis chapter 6, there&#39;s a strange statement: \u201cMy Spirit shall not strive with man forever, because he also is flesh; nevertheless his days shall be one hundred and twenty years.\u201d   ... easily disregarded as some silly &quot;magical curse&quot; for which there can be no evidence... but that sounds like Human Chromosome 2 to me.

Or, the site where the genetic information (such as the necessary for the CONTROLLED production and application of telomerase throughout the body) was prior to Genesis 6.   And when God determined human lifespans in this era should be a matter of decades (rather than centuries), he over-wrote that bit of genetic code in Noah&#39;s children&#39;s gamete&#39;s cells (thus all later generations dropping from 900 years to 200 years to modern lifespans in a matter of just a few generations).<br><br>If it were controlled, and throughout our bodies, it wouldn&#39;t be &quot;cancer&quot; because some tissues wouldn&#39;t be fatally overpowering other tissues.<br><br>...

However they also identified that the patient additionally had lung tumours, and presumably tumourous lymph nodes (described as &quot;grossly abnormal, solid, nodular masses&quot;, with those in his neck being several centimeters large). <br><br>Cell samples from the lungs and lymph nodes were sent for biopsy which is where the case took a weird turn from simply a tapeworm infection and relatively typical cancer to something far more peculiar. These tumour cells were non-human in origin, they were far to small to be human cells, and sometimes fused back together (something human cancer cells do not do). A molecular DNA analysis revealed that these cells were in fact those of the Dwarf Tapeworm, the continued infection of which in the man enabled it to acquire mutations which eventually led to at least on tapeworm in him becoming cancerous, and subsequently that tapeworm tumour then metastasized throughout the man&#39;s body.<br><br>While this situation seemingly requires a very specific set of conditions (compromised immune system alongside a severe dwarf tapeworm infection, or possibly an infection by any autoinfectious parasite), in the developing world these conditions do crop up frequently, and could overlap with somewhat frequency, and so may in fact be occurring multiple times but being misdiagnosed as human cancer.<br><br>It&#39;s an example not as successful as the CTVT, but it shows a cancerous tumour spreading at least for a short time beyond it&#39;s originator, and significantly of a tumour jumping species, a key trait of many dangerous pathogens.", "comment_date": "2022-06-24T11:57:03Z", "likes_count": 444}, {"comment_by": "Ismail Nuzaif", "comment_text": ".", "comment_date": "2022-06-24T11:41:20Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "TCDooM TCDooM", "comment_text": "Awesome, thanks", "comment_date": "2022-06-24T11:25:48Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "denijane", "comment_text": "Ok, that&#39;s really creepy.

Evolution happens on the level of reproducible things - the individual genes. Including the ones that &quot;don&#39;t do anything&quot; (in the body). Including the ones that have detrimental effects on the body. Evolution over time selects those that are best adapted to their environment - and that environment includes <i>the other genes</i> with which it shares the bodies they build together. A cancerous cell-line that can survive the death of the body means the mutated gene was successful; one that <i>doesn&#39;t</i> survive didn&#39;t succeed - it wasn&#39;t well adapted to its environment. It&#39;s much the same with other overpopulation situations where a cell (or a plant, or an animal) spreads too much and kills the whole population.<br><br>An interesting way to look at cancer is also from the point of view of the history of any individual somatic cell. Think about it - those somatic cells have spent something like 40 generations reproducing under strict controls, controlled by the body around them. But before those 40 generations, there were <i>billions</i> of generations where the line was sexual cells, reproducing like crazy.

For example, polio&#39;s strategy is to spread in poop. It&#39;s very, very good at this. It takes only 20 viral particles to make someone sick. Someone could spread polio entirely asymptomatically in poop for weeks before they even notice they are sick, if they even get sick. It can persist for a very long time, even when the body creates an immune response against it. And all this is not actually a problem for us, because unlike many other viruses of the digestive system, although polio obviously kills the cells it infects, it doesn&#39;t seem to infect enough cells to cause any disruption in organ function. In 90% or more of patients, it causes no disease. <br><br>However, in some patients, in makes it into the blood, and from there, it can replicate in muscle and fat tissue, causing aches and pains and all sorts of unpleasantness. Worse, in about 10% of those patients it spreads from the muscles to motor neurons and the CNS, where it causes paralysis, meningitis and possibly death. But here&#39;s the thing. Someone with symptomatic polio is no more contagious, and might even be less contagious, than someone with asymptomatic polio. No matter how high the levels of virus in the blood, muscles, and brain end up, none of them leave the host and seed new infections. Because of this, there are plenty of successful mutant strains of poliovirus that have actually lost the ability to infect nerve cells. We even encouraged the evolution of some of these these strains to use as the oral polio vaccine. They can spread very successfully, being just as capable of seeding new infections as the strains that can infect nerve cells.\u00a0<br><br>And yet, something weird happens. These viruses &quot;revert&quot; to pathogenic ones. Mutations crop up to allow them to infect and kill nerves cells. But I just said that infecting nerve cells confers no survival advantage to polio. So why does polio repeatedly evolve to infect these cell lines? Well, the individual virus particles that have the ability to infect blood, muscles, and nerves can now exploit new niches and make billions of copies of themselves. Sure in the long run, they don&#39;t actually succeed in spreading their genetic information anymore than a lung cancer cell that makes billions of copies of itself succeeds in spreading. In the long term, when the host dies, they go extinct. In the long term, when the massive cell damage they cause alerts the immune system to their presence, they go extinct.

It may be in the best interest of the collective covid viruses in a body to become something like a cold that doesn&#39;t ramp up the immune system too much and lets the patient run around and carry on with their day and spread viruses everywhere. But if an individual virus particle develops a mutation that allows it to multiply unchecked in the brain, then the virus will multiply in the brain.

Hank Williams: Cancer is caused by evolution acting on the cells of a multicellular organism rather than on the organism itself. Cancer cells have human DNA, but they have started living for themselves, metabolizing, replicating, and evolving instead of for you.<br>In other words, cancer is kind of a return to a single-celled lifestyle, at least. CTVT is a type of cancer that jumps from one organism to another in a very unusual way. A dog with CTVT does not have a cancer made of its own cells; it has a disease made of cells that are descended from a dog that has been dead for thousands of years. We&#39;re not entirely sure how this happened, but scientists say it&#39;s a testament to the ability of the human genome to adapt and persist in a new ecological niche. The fact that there is a line of pathogenic cells, reproducing asexually, that has persisted from an ancient dog that has persisted for millennia is one of the weirdest things that Hank has ever found out about biology.<br>It only makes sense if you view cancer not as a malfunction, but as a kind of terrible evolutionary success.
