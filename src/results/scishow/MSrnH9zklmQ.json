During the first year, I had faith in God that i would be cured someday.This disease started circulating all over my body and I have been taking treatment from my doctor, few weeks ago I came across a testimony of Rose Smith on the internet testifying about a Man called Dr Favour on how he cured her from 7 years HSV 2. And she also gave the email address of this man, advise anybody to contact him for help on any kind of diseases that he would be of help, so I emailed him telling him about my (HSV 2) he told me not to worry that I was going to be cured!! Well, I never doubted him I have faith he can cure me too,, Dr Favour prepared and sent me Healing Oil, Soap, roots and herbs which I took. In the first one week, I started experiencing changes all over me, after four weeks of using his Roots/ Herbs, Oil and Soap, I was totally cured. no more inching , pain on me anymore as Dr Favour assured me. After some time I went to my doctor to do another test behold the result came out negative. So friends my advise is if you have such disease or know anyone who suffers from it or any other disease like HPV, HBV, HIV, ALS, HBP, CANCER etc. you can contact Dr.favour for help via\u00a0drfavour37@gmail.com\u00a0or whatsapp +2348028081669", "comment_date": "2020-10-15T15:08:13Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Robert Sandberg", "comment_text": "I&#39;ve cut slug&#39;s eyes off too!\ud83e\udd23", "comment_date": "2020-10-15T09:09:02Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Jennifer Havard", "comment_text": "Don&#39;t reptiles have a third eye for detecting light?", "comment_date": "2020-10-14T02:50:16Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Klaty", "comment_text": "blind people at the intro probably... wait, do blind people cry?", "comment_date": "2020-10-14T02:36:28Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Ed` Bland", "comment_text": "ADVANCE HUMANITY<br>Growing HEMP will restore the &#39;soil&#39;, will restore the &#39;atmosphere&#39;.<br>Will create BIO-DEGRADABLE plastics.<br>RESTORE EARTH<br>This is the only way I can get this message out; HEMP plastics is the future for earth.<br>LET IT BE KNOWN;<br>I wrecked my Harley not wearing my helmet that stopped my heart 3 times, put me into an 87 day coma waking with a 5.5 brain injury requiring relearning life.
