Cheap Chinese E juice has replaced good quality American E juice (like seemingly everything in this country over the last 40 years) because of draconian regulation set forth by biased and unscientific doctors, naive anti smoking \u201cadvocates\u201d, and corrupt politicians who&#39;ve been bought and paid for by large corporations (in this particular case RJ Reynolds and Phillip Morris/Altria).<br><br>this legislation is the sole reason why people are being injured and dying due to inferior products from China which are sold online without any regulation. it&#39;s not the cheap Chinese products that are the problem.

They underestimated the likelihood of so much market share going to cheap Chinese products when they wrote the legislation for the politicians to rubber stamp. whether It was hubris or negligence the outcome was the same.

I became interested in this subject because a number of the symptoms were the same as devastating (presumed) viruses that caused outbreaks in my geographical area. Our doctors called these monsters &quot;unknown&quot; &quot;really tough&quot; viruses. The basic trajectory was onset of mild respiratory illness followed by terrible intestinal symptoms about 48 hours later. I do not think ARDS was part of the profile. It seemed more elderly people died. A significant number of people were permanently damaged, basically with ME/CFS. The people I know who were victims, were never vapers though some smoked tobacco.<br><br>One report claimed the first EVALI case was in a man in his 60&#39;s who did not use THC, who had used nicotine vapes from legitimate sources, for many years after stopping smoking.<br><br>The original geographic patterns for EVALI seemed to show clusters of the illness. I wondered if an infectious agent was adding to the disorder. Young people I know who vape, frequently share vapes and inhale deeply. <br><br>It seemed to me that adulterated product would have had a wider distribution, for instance over a geographic area of distribution, rather than small cluster groups.<br><br>For quite a while, it was reported that all of the EVALI cases were in the US. Eventually there were some cases in Canada and the Caribbean. Today&#39;s video is the first time I have heard of cases in Europe. If adulterated product is the cause, is there a distribution network that mainly or only services the U.S.?<br><br>Then science seemed to name vitamin E acetate + TCH, both of which could point to illicit manufacture. Then COVID came and i wondered if EVALI cases were early COVID. Research indicates that SARS-CoV2 was circulating at least much earlier in 2019 than has been thought.<br><br>Of more interest to me is if part of EVALI causation might be an as yet unidentified virus. <br><br>The good thing i think we will get from COVID is that doctors and researchers are paying attention to those with &quot;Long COVID&quot;. Prior to this, folks who failed to recover from a viral infection in a maximum of 21 days, were discarded into the human garbage dump of psychiatry. At least that is what happened to those who were stupid enough to continue to complain of illness. The smart ones shut up, did the best they could, some until they could no longer work, at which time they began protracted battles for disability status.<br><br>All of this is anecdotal and my reasoning may be faulty. There seem to be &quot;unknown&quot; &quot;really tough&quot; viruses that do terrible things to people, and which science cannot detect. Might there be a viral component to EVALI? Has enough research been done to rule out a stealthy virus as part of the cause of EVALI?

E-cigarette use propylene glycol and glycerol. They are water soluble and get absorbed into your blood stream, which clears the lungs of these compounds.  They are food additives with a proven safety record when absorbed into the blood stream. When it comes to marijuana vapes, the manufacturers were using approved hemp terpenes as a diluent, a liquid used to dilute the THC resin, but those cost over $1,000 per gallon. In mid 2019, some shady manufacturers started using vitamin E acetate, which only costs $20 per gallon and is an oil that is not water soluble, which means it coats the airways in your lungs in a thin film of oil, that prevents oxygen transfer and does not get absorbed into the blood stream. In the second half of 2019, people started getting sick and the sellers of vitamin E acetate as a diluent quickly stopped selling their products, with their websites quickly disappearing. By November 2019, it was widely known that vitamin E acetate was the culprit and the incidence of EVALI rapidly started to decline. By the time that Covid hit, in March and April of 2020, the only people that were getting EVALI were people that were using old products, or underground THC vape manufactures that still had vitamin E on hand and had not gotten the memo. By mid 2020, EVALI was pretty much a thing of the past. To recap, people that were in the pipeline to use terpene based products, ie THC vapes, were the only people that could get the adulterated vitamin E acetate. People that use e-cigarette were only getting propylene glycol and glycerol and did not get this disease. And the disease is pretty much a thing of the past. 2019 and 2020? Yes. In 2022?

What else, uhmmm,  oh yeah, make sure to get a pneumonia shot too. When you stop vaping or smoking, you repair the skin tissue inside of your lungs. Skin tissue, that is rotting inside of your lungs causes pneumonia, and you should get a shot to prevent this. Also, cilia, little tiny hairs inside of your body that &quot;sense&quot; you internally are either destroyed while smoking, or suppressed while vaping. Tar is in there too, if you&#39;re a smoker. Imagine a tube, flesh tube, small flesh tubes, covered with tar, a layer for each cigarette smoked. Your body needs to remove the tar, and pushes the tar from the flesh walls with mucus, trapping the free radicals. Then attempts to remove the mucus. Really, you will produce a lot more amount of mucus, to remove one small particle of flesh, hair, tar, glycol, free radical, whatever, out of your body. Restoring the Cilia can cause ingrown hairs if scabbing didn&#39;t process well. You have to do breathing exercises, and swelling exercises to restore the muscles in the cheeks, chin, throat, ears, necks, heart, lungs, I think the mucus tract can go to the anus, just incase you eat something spicey. Also, if you&#39;re lactose intolerant, you will produce mucus to fight the lactose. Mucus is cool if you think about, like how expansive it gets with liquid? Or consolidated, and dried out it can get?

Covid draws fluid into the lungs and so does the PG in vapes. So same problem brings same symptoms. &quot;PG is a laxative and draws water from your blood across membranes by osmosis. Water is drawn into your colon and also into your lungs.  Fluid in your lungs isn&#39;t ok ornormal. Smoking laxatives doesn&#39;t sound harmless. Regular use likely leads to allergies  to the PG that promote mucus production..  PG itself is used to moisturize the nasal cavities if a dry nose causes bleeding.  PG can also become a mild irritant and repeat exposure cause allergic / histamine type response. PG is known to cause systemic dermatitis and exacerbate conditions such as asthma.  PG has high osmolality meaning substances including toxins can more easily enter cells and cross membranes. That&#39;s why it is a great laxative and lousy aerosol. Rub some in your eye. Now imagine that in your lungs. Not good. PG has been sold as GRAS and if used in flavors doesn&#39;t even have to be labeled as an ingredient.  Last but not least it is derived from a know mutagen / carcinogen and depending on the process the derivavtive PG may not be 100% or pure PG and may contain trace compounds it was made from. Like petroleum. Are vapes as harmful as cigarettes, probably not. Are vapes 100% safe. Probably not, few things are. VG in e-juice is similarly hyperosmotic and also a laxative. Except the laxative induced fluid can escape your colon. Your lungs are a narrow maze of tubes in a bag. Perfect for storing fluids. With continuous consumption PG accumulates in the body. Also it may simply be the fact the PG when inhaled coats the lung tissue the same way it coats your skin in skin products and thus reduces gas exchange diffusion  saturation and so on. The reduction in lung function may feel calming by reducing oxygen intake levels relative to CO2  and therefore reducing hyperventilation similar to the use of a paper bag. &quot; True story.", "comment_date": "2022-08-09T22:16:49Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Daniel Crawford", "comment_text": "\ud83e\udde0\ud83e\udde0No they used as a cover for coivd as it was already circulating in the US.
