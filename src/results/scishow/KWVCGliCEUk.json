I tried mowing my own lawn once with a mask on because I like repetitive tasks, and then I nearly had to go to the hospital because of it. I legit have to be careful wherever I go, because if the grass has been recently mowed, I already know I\u2019m gonna have a hard time breathing. As I\u2019ve found out from being a guinea pig owner, hay is no exception; while not as severe as freshly-cut grass, I still react a fair amount.
