When neurons die, they do not come back because in adulthood new neurons can not form; however, that doesn&#39;t mean that the brain can&#39;t adapt to their loss through a &quot;rewiring&quot; or plasticity of the surround synapses. This processes is involved mainly with the glutamatergic system under the context of learning and memory, but in reference to critical periods, I think this would be better explained by acknowledging the role of NGF and BDNF as they play a crucial role in the routing of neuronal circuitry as well the survival of the neuron itself. There is new research suggesting that using growth factors, they may be able to reopen critical period (in humans idk bc there has not be human trials). There are multiple theories on why a growth period ends that range from myelination, a change in glutamatergic receptors, as well as constraint of cortical activation.
