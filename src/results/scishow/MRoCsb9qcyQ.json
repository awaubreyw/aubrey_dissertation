No, the town officials and scientists in Italy were not convicted for failing to predict an Earthquake. The court convicted them for predicting no Earthquake would happen, as the court agreed it is impossible to predict Earthquakes, impossible to say when one will happen or when one will not happen.<br><br>You see after weeks of minor tremors, the people of L&#39;Aquila had started to sleep outside their homes in tents. Their panic was made worse by a retired scientist, Giampaolo Giuliani, who predicted the town would be soon flattened by a huge earthquake. A town hall meeting was convened to debunk his predictions. The officials and scientists predicted no earthquake would happen, the minor tremors were releasing energy making a big earthquake impossible.<br><br>Indeed Government official, Bernardo De Bernardinis, told worried villagers to go home and enjoy a glass of Montepulciano (a popular Italian wine). People slept indoors for the first time in weeks, 6 days later a Mag 6.3 hit the town, killing over 300 people. Many of whom would not have died if the meeting was not held and officials did not predict no earthquake.<br><br>However, don&#39;t misunderstand me, I don&#39;t agree with this conviction, it was right it was overturned.
