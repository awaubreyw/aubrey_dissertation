Firstly, i&#39;ve looked into Palenque&#39;s waterworks systems before, it should be noted that while there are what appears to be toilets at Palenque, as far as i&#39;m aware there&#39;s no evidence that those toilets themselves were part of the pressurized channel that was found at the site, which from the papers I&#39;ve read seems to have been in place to create a upwards fountain/spout, though maybe i&#39;m unaware of newer research. I will say Palenque in general had very complex waterworks systems,, the site had dozens of springs in or around the city which coalesced into many streams and rivers which ran through it, so the city had dozens of open air and underground aqueducts, drainage systems, dams, reservoirs, etc to deal with that.<br><br>As far as other other Mesoamerican cities with toilets, Teotihuacan seems to have had some: Teotihuacan was a major Metropolis in Central Mexico during the Classical period, and at it&#39;s height around 500AD, had 100,000+ denizens, had a planned urban grid covering almost 2 dozen square kilometers of fancy temples and palaces with painted frescos, dozens of rooms and open air courtyards, which even most of the city&#39;s commoners lived in. Some these palace compounds had plumbing and channel systems, and what seem to pretty clearly resemble toilets, though in conversations I&#39;ve had with researchers who have worked at the site, excavations haven&#39;t yielded connections to other plumbing systems in the city, which is odd since in photos of the toilets there are what appear to be channels attached to them.<br><br>It&#39;s also known that the Aztec captial of Tenochtitlan had public latrines/toilets alongside major roads, and that there civil servants who washed and swept streets and buildings and collected waste from these toilets (allegedly on a daily basis), and that waste was then recycled into dyes and fertilizer.", "comment_date": "2021-08-25T22:10:32Z", "likes_count": 74}, {"comment_by": "Michelle Schu-blacka", "comment_text": "The fact that humans need a waste disposal system, especially such disgusting and dangerous waste, is proof that either there is no god and if there is, it&#39;s far from being an &#39;intelligent designer&#39;.", "comment_date": "2021-08-25T22:08:56Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "birdsquirrel", "comment_text": "My house has the toilets with #1 and #2 buttons, but they are unfortunately TOO low flow for the pipes we have.
