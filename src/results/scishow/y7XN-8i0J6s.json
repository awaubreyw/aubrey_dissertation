Do we know how to stop it from destroying us all? That&#39;s what I worry about.<br>I love science but do we really want to discover this right now?

Literally, it&#39;s Time.  And the reason why we see it is because physics posits that no two objects can occupy the exact same place at the exact same time. If the fourth dimention is at a perfect right angle to the first, second, and third dimensions, but isn&#39;t smaller or larger (like a hypercube drawing), then it must obviously be occupying the exact same space...but since a physical object cannot occupy that same space, any such object in neighboring dimensions pushes its neighbor(s) away. <br><br>This creates the perception of time via movement--the universe expanding, the galaxy swirling, the solar system moving, the Earth spinning, et cetera, all because the various hypercube spaces of the 4th dimension are full of near-identical copies of everything.  The reason why time (the movement of all objects through the fourth dimension, attempting to occupy the same or similar points in existence) is linearly constrained into just one direction is because of conservation of momentum:  an object in motion tends to stay in motion until some force acts upon it.  <br><br>We are being jostled in one direction, and we have billions of years of momentum built up from all that jostling (even if entropy does play its part).  Like a locomotive train that has built up a lot of speed, it&#39;ll take a lot of energy to slow down, or some way of bending the tracks so that they loop back around (but we ourselves on the train will still be going forwards).<br><br>The fourth dimension&#39;s movement being based upon similar objects trying to occupy similar spaces may actually explain the phenomenon known as the Mandela Effect.  This could be a case of the &quot;double-slit photon experiment&quot; effect--where if a photon has the choice of 2 side-by-side slits to pass through, if it is observed at any point, it will definitely choose one slit or the other, but if it isn&#39;t observed at all, it will appear to pass through both slits simultaneously, causing an interference pattern on the photoreceptors recording the experiment.  <br><br>Some people remembering Nelson Mandela dying in prison in South Africa (even though he didn&#39;t) could actually be remembering a moment when their right-angle-hypercube jogged to the left instead of the right, before &#39;correcting&#39; back onto the main path that everyone else has been taking all along.  Like the balls in a Galton Board machine dropping down between the pegs, the most likely outcomes form a bell curve of probabilities.  Some balls may go right or left at the starting point, but the vast majority end up in the same or similar space, in the center of the bell curve.<br><br>Thus some of us (myself included, though conversely I always knew all along that Mandela was still very much alive) remember those old illustrated children&#39;s books being titled: The Berenstein Bears, versus what they were really titled: The Berenstain Bears.  -ain versus -ein.  ...An annoying side-effect of being in a Galton Board machine fourth-dimensionally; we pass around a post and cannot see the exact same thing as the other dropping bouncing balls can see, not until we&#39;re farther down the board.<br><br>So no, the comment about being unable to see the fourth dimension is not entirely accurate.  We literally see Time, the 4th Dimension, all the time!  We just cannot <b>draw</b> it quite as conveniently...at least, not without paying an artist to draw it as a flipbook or something.

And then, this &quot;Holy supernova&quot; of  his Spirit, and flesh,  expanded into the  resurrection of his flesh, , which relates to our resurrection,  , as quantum particles can effect others particles , that have been related previously. <br> Jesus teaches all men across time and space. That&#39;s why he had to  enter Hell and gained  the code or the &quot;keys&quot;  , so He now, controls both  Heaven and Hell. Its fascinating when you take time to  understand basic quantum facts, it all fits. With the bible stuff and makes the weird bible stuff , make more sense. <br> How to be happy now?<br>All we can do, as mere mortals , as the sons of man ,  is think about Jesus in our minds eye, in the NOW , to be connected to this power. And ask Him to remotely enter your field of  gravity within your heart and mind <br>. By our love of Him,  seeking  His love , we combine forces for Good to speak words of power and gather His  people  of peace.. We must seek His Holy positive charge,  by becoming a humble negative charge BE STILL AND KNOW I AM GOD . Then his &quot;positive  lighting power&quot; can be received in our negative body and then,  Our cell  energy will Rise  into a higher  power in the form and self love and love for others, thru forgiveness,  and understanding our pain energy and transforming it thru love . (As He did). <br>We must change our sinful will and DNA back to a purified innocent  state, and breath in His holy Spirit  which surrounds us,  in the airs water ,( He is the living water )which contains minute electricity  and thus gravity within us . ( See video &gt; The code In water) His holy gravity , helps us, by  leading  to the expansion of our cells and our greatest self , without the need for validation from others. He sets us free by thinking upon his death and resurrection. <br>The power of gratitude towards God, empowers God to help us<br>The bible is a big Quantum book for primitive  man. Read it, repent  and pray for the truth,  and it will be revealed. We must love ourselves and  one another to understand this complicated  code. Love has the greatest gravity of all.

Couldn&#39;t a black hole theoretically become great enough it draws energy and mass particles from surrounding sources and eventually become large enough to be a problem?  It&#39;s an assumption based on the fact light cannot escape a black hole and they suck in mass. If it is possible in theory then its a good thing there isn&#39;t a break-even nuclear reactor in existence that emits light or even worse heat and a source of mass to pull from.........Oh wait.......I just remembered there is a such thing as the sun and the Earth. <br><br>No offense meant by this but to say the LHC is incapable of the necessary energy to create a black hole does not mean that it will always be incapable of it. So to finalize it as there is &#39;probably&#39; nothing to worry about means we should worry about it when the LHC is over half way to being capable of utilizing that much energy. <br><br>Why shouldn&#39;t creating a black hole not be worrisome? You can clearly see that scientist have only posited theoretical ideas about them so they don&#39;t actually fully understand the implications of creating one outside the vacuum of space. Different environments usually yields different results. <br><br>I understand that theoretically a micro black hole created on Earth may fizzle out, then again it may do the opposite as it has never been done before. In an environment where there is literally a ball of mass with massive amounts of energy available around it I can&#39;t see why it would fizzle out if created on Earth. I&#39;m sorry but essentially if one is created on Earth it then has a pretty good source of energy and mass to pull from. <br><br>Not to mention the tendency of them altering time and space around themselves is a pretty good reason no one should ever try that. If doing that on Earth created an effect of sucking mass and energy to sustain itself then it would be a process we would have no Earthly clue how to stop and as it grew the eventual outcome would be irreversible and severe. It is and will always be stupid to do something like that, because it is going into it without the necessary knowledge you need to do it with a level of control.

Please address my counter arguments about CERN\u2019s Large Hadron Collider.<br><br>1. Cosmic rays -  The 1st safety argument is that nature has already generated on Earth as many collisions as about a million LHC experiments and the planet still exists but that has nothing to do with the risks associated when quark explosions convert matter into a strangelet because cosmic rays are not quarks, they are an entirely different substance. 99% are gamma rays and protons while the remaining 1% are atomic nuclei.<br>Cosmic rays come from distant stars and arrive and collide with planetary bodies in solitary, harmless units, they are not masses of heavy gold and lead atoms with hundreds of quarks packed in tight bundles and cracked in precise collisions that liberate a critical mass of millions of strange quarks that are theoretically capable of starting an Ice-9 reaction. The fact is that we have never found a single deconfined quark in a century of cosmic ray analysis. The first safety argument is therefore a blatant lie that breaks two fundamental scientific proofs of truth; experimental evidence and the known cause principle. The primary reason physicists are doing those experiments in particle accelerators is precisely because nature does not do them on planet Earth otherwise we would just keep building cosmic ray detectors like the one CERN has in its museum which reveals precisely how unimpressive the force of a solitary cosmic ray actually is.<br><br>2. Evaporating black holes \u2013 The 2nd safety argument is that even if black holes are created, they will evaporate. (It is important to note that the creation of black holes at CERN is considered probable at new energy regimes by both promoters and opponents of these colliders). Many black holes could be created by smashing protons into anti-protons with enough energy, if one were created near a large concentration of mass and if it started absorbing that mass before exploding, the black hole could reach a relatively stable half-life and thus continue to grow. In Einstein\u2019s theory, black holes are frozen stars that are likely composed of the heaviest top quarks which will be mass produced as the primary decay particles of the Higgs Boson. Modern string theory also predicts that black holes will be created at new energy regimes but according to relativity theory, once formed, these black holes will swallow the Earth. Since the industry of accelerators knows it cannot deny the possibility of creating black holes it has chosen to simply rebuke those risks of extinction by invoking a false safety assurance about the nature of black holes. Their claim is that these black holes will simply evaporate which is based on an unproven hypothesis that contradicts both Einstein\u2019s black hole theory and the fundamental laws of thermodynamics. He coined the word Entropy to mean the amount of thermal energy not available to do work. Based on the everyday observation that warm objects such as a cup of coffee always spontaneously become colder, Clausius stated the 2nd law of thermodynamics; that the ability of energy to do work is always decreasing. In other words, the universe tends towards maximum entropy. According to Einstein\u2019s equations, a black hole is born as a mass vortex that turns at light speed. This means that in terms of temperature, it is extremely hot. The black hole then begins to grow its mass exponentially as it lowers its temperature, transferring its extreme heat to the star or planet and devouring it in a dual big bang (big crunch). According to the laws of thermodynamics, heat always moves from the hot source, in this case the black hole to the cold environment it evaporates which would be the Earth. Yet to eliminate the risks posed by black holes, the safety report denies both the laws of thermodynamics and standard black hole theory, choosing instead to believe in Steven Hawkings never proven hypothesis that black holes break all the laws of thermodynamics and evaporate.<br>Steven Hawkings evaporating black holes break most of the known laws of science which according to the scientific principle of correspondence is a proof of falsity. Evaporating black holes have also been disproven experimentally after 30 years of unsuccessful searches for them in the cosmos which is another basic proof of falsity. Once you break the fundamental laws of science all kinds of magical possibilities present themselves. Hawking for example advertises his imaginary black holes in conferences around the world as a potential source of perpetual energy, the most common hoax of 19th century science before the laws of Entropy made them impossible, a fact that Mr Hawking seems to have forgotten. <br><br>3. Strange Quark Liquid \u2013 The 3rd safety argument claims that strange quark liquid will not be produced on planet Earth because it is in fact a hot gas, not a liquid. Theory suggests that heavy ion collisions are not a good place to produce strangelets but scientists working at Brookhavens RHIC (Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider) have already admitted to producing strange quark liquid. This fact alone disproves by sheer experimental evidence the 3rd safety assurance. While new scientific papers appear constantly on the physics of the strange liquid being produced in those accelerators, the world is assured that such a feat is impossible. Similarly, CERN installed the CASTOR detector (a Calorimeter) that will search for different types of strangelets with a stated 70% chance of finding them. Yet officially there is no danger because there will not be absolute proof of an Ice-9 reaction as long as the Earth continues to exist. Despite these dangers, a second process of liquid formation; the creation of stable dual strange quark atoms called Dibaryons has begun in both the colliders at Brookhaven and CERN. The creation of a strangelet mass large enough to start an Ice-9 reaction is consequently almost certain. Invisible dual strange atoms, more stable than our matter and so heavy, that when created, immediately fall towards the centre of the Earth cutting through the light magma. They could be sitting there right now, growing in numbers until they reach the super critical mass needed to freeze the planet. Only then will we have the absolute proof that the Earth no longer exists. As CERN has explained, we know of no absolute barrier through the rapid growth of a dangerous strangelet. In a catastrophic chain reaction, the weight of a killer strangelet would pull it down, eventually the strangelet would sit at the centre of the Earth eating other nuclei, attracting the Earth\u2019s mass gravitationally, it would eat our planet from the inside out, converting the Earth into one giant strangelet. Since we cannot observe the centre of the Earth, there will never be an absolute proof of this slow leak of strange atoms.<br><br>4. Quark Matter \u2013 The 4th safety argument states that at present, despite vigorous searches, there is no evidence whatsoever for stable strange matter anywhere in the Universe but when the safety report was signed there was no absolute proof of the existence and nature of the very same strange quark matter it\u2019s accelerators are producing right now. This lie is falsified by the industries own experiments and by all the pervading presence of quark matter in the Universe. There is now a general agreement among astrophysicists for example that the core of pulsars is made of quark matter which is responsible for the explosion of stars called supernovas but because quark matter does not interact with light, we cannot see the stars core.", "comment_date": "2020-09-06T13:09:14Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Sam ASMR", "comment_text": "This is season 1 flash", "comment_date": "2020-09-06T08:24:50Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Misha Purser", "comment_text": "I had too much fun watching this XD I love science", "comment_date": "2020-09-06T08:18:03Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "ScumDink", "comment_text": "Call me miles morales cause I&#39;m stopping that bih \ud83d\udc41\ufe0f", "comment_date": "2020-09-06T06:01:05Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "1stGuyGamez _", "comment_text": "Hank has returned!!<br><br>insert meme \u2018return of the king\u2019", "comment_date": "2020-09-05T15:16:25Z", "likes_count": 2}, {"comment_by": "Fernando Fierro", "comment_text": "We already have a black hole.. it&#39;s name is Trump..

Where on earth that it is sitting on the gravitational wave that is inaccessible to anyone? None. <br>Einstein&#39;s famous equation, E=mc^2 is wrong otherwise garbage also can be used to make nuclear bombs as long as it is matter or it has mass. Energy and matter can&#39;t intechange one another according to Einstein&#39;s famous equation. One must have photons before one can emit out photons. Photons are particles and they have mass. All forms of EMWs including light and heat are dynamic photons per volume per time in different saturation. <br>Einstein&#39;s relativity theory is also wrong because things can actually travel faster than the speed of light. Speed of light is not the limit. Really? NASA claimed that Hubble Space Telescope can see the formative state of the young universe which implies that celestial bodies were travelling much faster than the speed of light in the past but somehow they have slowed down for some time slow enough now for the light of the past to catch up with us that enable us to see the young universe.<br>Mathematics play a limited role in scientific research, especially physics. Really? There are not many functions, except mx+c=y. Really? For instance, x^2=y is not a function. Prove it? When y&#39;s are prime numbers, x&#39;s will be irrational numbers or unsettled numbers. In other words, when y&#39;s are prime numbers, x&#39;s are unresolved which indicate that there are points of discontinuity along the curve of x^2=y. Thus, x^2=y is not a function. The same will apply to x^3=y and so forth. So, the only function left is mx+c=y.<br>There is only three-dimensional in the universe coupled with time flow which is the narration of the dynamic of the universe. The dynamic of the universe is a cycle; Big Bang followed by expansion to its maximum size before imploding towards the center of the universe to pave way for future Big Bang.<br>A black hole emerged when a dying massive star collapsed under its own massive weight where atoms crunched to quarks before reducing further to preons, elementary particles where negative preons surrounded by positive preons, or vice versa to form an enormous superstructure of a black hole. Colliding particles at extreme high speeds will unable to reduce them to preons. Only crunching them while they are in a lump collapsed under its own massive weights will be able to reduce the atoms to preons.  <br>A black hole will radiate out Hawking radiation whenever it is feasting on plunging celestial bodies onto it. In other words, atoms of plunging celestial bodies will be ripping apart under enormous gravitational force of the dense superstructure of a black hole before reducing them to preons where excess photons would be excreted away as Hawking radiation in parallel to the theory that one must have photons before one can emit out photons since Einstein&#39;s famous equation is wrong or not true.. <br>All in all, LHC will fail to produce even an extremely tiny black  hole during smashing of &quot;hydrogen&quot; atoms. <br>If you are interested in real discoveries, I would recommend you to read my book, The Unification Theory = Volume One and you will be amazed with lots of new, interesting discoveries.

Einstein\u2026 utterly rejected the idea of ether and inferred from its nonexistence that the equations of electromagnetism had to be relative. But this same thought process led in the end to the very ether he had first rejected, albeit one with some special properties that ordinary elastic matter does not have. The word \u201cether\u201d has extremely negative connotations in theoretical physics because of its past association with opposition to relativity. This is unfortunate because, stripped of these connotations, it rather nicely captures the way most physicists actually think about the vacuum.<br><br>In the early days of relativity the conviction that light must be waves of something ran so strong that Einstein was widely dismissed. Even when Michelson and Morley demonstrated that the earth\u2019s orbital motion through the ether could not be detected, opponents argued that the earth must be dragging an envelope of ether along with it because relativity was lunacy and could not possibly be right\u2026. Relativity actually says nothing about the existence or nonexistence of matter pervading the universe, only that such matter must have relativistic symmetry.<br><br>It turns out that such matter exists. About the time relativity was becoming accepted, studies of radioactivity began showing that the empty vacuum of space had spectroscopic structure similar to that of ordinary quantum solids and fluids. Subsequent studies with large particle accelerators have now led us to understand that space is more like a piece of window glass than ideal Newtonian emptiness. It is filled with \u201cstuff\u201d that is normally transparent but can be made visible by hitting it sufficiently hard to knock out a part. The modern concept of the vacuum of space, confirmed every day by experiment, is a relativistic ether.

That marks the beginning of the 7 year tribulation. The Abomination that causes desolation standing in the holy place, will be when they make a law microchipping babies at birth around March of 2021. We are so close to this micro chip system. Bill Gates just praised President elect Donald Trump as like JFK because they will unite the country in innovation ,as did JFK on going to the moon ...That innovation will be the microchip . You will see it and hear of it more and more...If this is something that you already know you will not accept then you need to start making preparations now ....time goes by with no regard and suddenly we stand before something that preparation , knowledge and our mental and physical state will play major part in what decision we make. All that refuse the micro chip and flee for safety will eventually see China bring military here to fulfill Isaiah 13...<br>with Russia guiding them to come get their 1.157 trillion owed to them and desecrate the land with full knowledge of American government . We are already betrayed but not like they are going to betray us....<br>On our Exodus from society we will need the ability to protect ourselves and to hunt for food . There will be women and children in our care. That means being prepared to survive off the grid and protect those that cannot protect themselves from plenty of militia groups that will also rebel from the government and not receive the gps trackable micro chip ...Not everyone that refuses the micro chip are the children of God.

( that defiantly does not describe me or the majority of Christians I know). The 144,000 are Isreal that \u05d9\u05d4\u05e8\u05d4 made a covenant with, 10,000 from each tribe. Then there is the remnant ( those that are prepared and flee this system) that will come through the great tribulation, having washed themselves clean by the blood of the Lamb and there is a third remnant ( revelation 20:4 ) the saints that will die for the testimony of our savior , Jesus. That is in part what the FEMA camps are for.<br><br>Anyone who receives this mark will share in the wrath of God un-diluted in the cup of his indignation .

That means Temple. You are then giving up your eternal spirit for destruction ( Revelation 14 : 9-12) . As it is written, where your treasure is there also will your heart be. In Revelation <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7XN-8i0J6s&amp;t=14m19s\">14:19</a> it speaks of a sickle thrust into the earth to reap the vine for harvest to be destroyed.

Trying to open a doorway to other dimensions !(Revelation 9:2).. Abyss???( Revelation 9:3-5) speaks of bound spirits will be released and those spirits will inhabit the spiritless that have received the microchip . I believe that these great locust that torment those that do not have the seal of God will be these spirits released from the abyss in control of drones and will be in control also of the military personnel .<br><br><a href=\"https://youtu.be/-rA4OUHBbAI\">https://youtu.be/-rA4OUHBbAI</a><br><br>The Mandela effect is the door closing as in Noah&#39;s day.

So wouldnt a 4 dimensional object in our 3 dimensional existence have the properties of infinite density, or more like a non finite density, because it would seem like it had different masses (because of our inability to determine it shape and measure its mass as a whole, kinda like measureing the mass of the tip of a person&#39;s finger in 2 dimensions , a 2 dimensional being would not see the 3 dimensional &quot;end&quot; to the item and measuring it would produce fallacies) and different volumes (because its size and shape would change from our observation on how it is interacting with 3 dimensional space). So maybe masses with infinite density do exist. Infinite density would only be something that could fit in this universe that has more mass than it. Am I wrong?

Devitt", "comment_text": "Thanks for clarifying that; but there is a reason why people have been thinking like this (the uncertainty of creating a big, destructive, matter-ripping black hole).<br><br><br>It unnerves most of us a bit that scientists are fiddling with things that, they themselves (and even you) admit that you guys sometimes don&#39;t fully understand.<br><br><br>And it doesn&#39;t help that you and other scientists say that you are <b>fairly</b> confident it won&#39;t make something destructive; cause this kind of thinking has happened throughout history (where scientists were <b>fairly</b> (and sometimes even definitely) certain that some destructive thing won&#39;t happen, but then it does by their surprise (or otherwise something happens that they didn&#39;t/couldn&#39;t even predict would happen, until it is too late).<br><br><br>And yes, that&#39;s how we make most discoveries in life, by experimenting, regardless of how certain we are or not. However in this case, people&#39;s lives and reality itself rides on this &quot;experimenting&quot;; so it&#39;s not something that happens in a vacuum to the science facility itself (...okay it is something that probably literally happens in a literal vacuum; but you know what I&#39;m trying to say. Hell that vacuum environment may help it not to expand outside of the LHC itself, so this itself protects us in the experimentation; but considering that there are still some things scientists still don&#39;t seem to 100% know in regards to black holes, vacuums and matter (as well as anti-matter); it still can be kind of unnerving to mess with that.\r<br>\r<br>Let&#39;s not forget that scientists are smashing them at near speed-of-light; then it becomes slightly more unnerving, cause some weird crap could occur if they accidentally move to/beyond light speed. Cause on the one hand there were some theories before that say this shouldn&#39;t be possible by man (or even otherwise); but then on the other hand there are some saying that with the discovery of the Higgs-Boson, this could turn that theory and others on its head in terms of that (and otherwise). Hell that in itself illustrates my point on what we really know should and shouldn&#39;t be possible; cause before that discovery, most scientists were extremely certain of their specific theories and analysis and that it is &quot;impossible&quot;/&quot;almost impossible&quot; to be wrong...but then they were (at least to some degree) incorrect or at least had to re-think some things in relation to that. So how certain can scientists be nowadays, with some things, one wonders....<br><br><br>As an extra note to add: cause you say it can&#39;t really happen, cause it&#39;s on such a small scale with such small amount of mass, that it would only be a tiny black hole that dissipates quickly. However let&#39;s not forget that, if the big bang theory is to be believed, that was also through a very tiny amount of mass/matter before THAT happened. Or am I incorrect in this thinking and that was actually a large amount of matter in a small amount of space? In which case I&#39;m fine to be wrong on this extra note, and I will detract it if necessary.<br><br><br>Irregardless; if I&#39;m correct in that thinking of The Big Bang, yeah you might say &quot;but I answered that cause I did say this is maybe possible with a large amount of energy; but we would never be able to form that amount of energy to make such a big black hole to be destructive enough&quot;. Again comes back to my previous point above; there have been previous things in scientific history where they&#39;ve also said &quot;well you will never get that amount of energy/other variable to do x, y, and z&quot;, but then we ended up doing it or something similar through new discoveries/experimentation and analysis..... so excuse me if some of us still take some scientists&#39; words with a metaphorical &quot;pinch of salt&quot;, and not just put all our faith in it at all times.", "comment_date": "2020-04-24T13:48:00Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Matt Evans", "comment_text": "Well, of course it&#39;s hard to observe gravity when you are next to an abject that exerts it&#39;s own (relatively) massive gravity.....", "comment_date": "2020-04-24T13:38:47Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Foamer 44", "comment_text": "Guess we would have a bigger problem than COVID.", "comment_date": "2020-04-24T13:37:12Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "XelPixels", "comment_text": "&quot;Why this gravity only rule?&quot;<br>Cause we saw it on interstellar.", "comment_date": "2020-04-24T13:34:15Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "asCii88", "comment_text": "This comes quite delayed", "comment_date": "2020-04-24T13:33:01Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "i_smoke_ghosts", "comment_text": "hey kids what is KEK ?", "comment_date": "2020-04-24T13:30:13Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Tarun Sachan", "comment_text": "Wait a minute - LHC ,CERN ,BLACK HOLES STEINS GATE", "comment_date": "2020-04-24T13:28:41Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Erik Wijnands", "comment_text": "KEK", "comment_date": "2020-04-24T13:22:25Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "FateOfSilver", "comment_text": "KEK", "comment_date": "2020-04-24T13:19:23Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Intet Mane", "comment_text": "Let\u2019s hope it\u2019s not a fermi technology", "comment_date": "2020-04-24T13:17:31Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "ShortHandsLongFingers", "comment_text": "kek", "comment_date": "2020-04-24T13:14:57Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Bangtan Humanist", "comment_text": "I don&#39;t even want a tiny black hole.
