It&#39;s a trait easily seen in all species that have internal fertilization. And in no other species than Homo Sapiens Sapiens, is it more easily seen, than if we look at the penis size of the subgroups of said species, where Homo Sapiens Sapiens Africanus, the Penis size is the biggest, due to lower rates of co-parenting. Meanwhile in Homo Sapiens Sapiens Thulius, penis size can be as low as 8cm. Compared to the roughly 25cm of the Africanus supgroup. Overall the average for all subgroups of Homo Sapiens Sapiens is 13cm.<br><br>The penis main purpose is to remove other sperm from the female while leaving it&#39;s own... and if you belong to a wild tribe in Africa that to prevent inbreeding practices forced copulation with female slaves of neighboring tribes, as the general practice was in Africa until the 1800s when the British and French outlawed Slavery in Africa. Well yeah. Some things are in general pretty easy to understand. If we like what we hear, is up to each and every one of us to decide for ourselves, But I do understand those African tribesmen, because as the saying goes, the grass is always greener on the other side, hence why there are so many xenophiles in our part of the world, after all, despite what people think, in the deep south of America, Ebony x Ivory is a widely searched term for Adult Oriented Videos. And I must say, Black women tend to take care of their skin way better than white women. Well such is life, we are all into different things, and last time I checked, I prefer them pretty and not ugly and useless genetic trash, which is why I generally find black women better than the generally inbred looking white women, yes I said most white women look inbred, and it&#39;s the truth, come on, some of them look like they got mauled by a bear and then had a pigs face surgically implanted to fix it up again, several times. Reminds me of the 90s when you downloaded a picture. and it loaded from the bottom and up, not always but some pictures did, and you first saw the feet, then the legs, then it slowly traveled up, and you&#39;d seen the whole body and it was just the head left, and OH MY GOD THAT FACE, Oh please hand me a bucket I need to puke.<br><br>Thank god for high internet speed today.
