MANY times we had to go in the back n pick up the dead birds n chipmunks and mice and any lil animal it could grab and a bunch of times full grown rabbits. And as CRAZY as it sounds one time I found a dead female red tail hawk. It got it as the hawk grabbed a large mouse. While the hawk was leaned over with its head down the lil serial killer jumped on its back and just started crunching n ripping at its neck n head and in less then a min the hawk was dead.
