Why? Because they do something completely natural for years. As long as we don\u2019t have too much of them and it\u2019s a place there were boars before, let them be pigs. Predators and more meat would be a solution if there are too many.<br><br>What\u2019s the difference with humans? We dig out fossil fuels that are deep under the ground and were there for millions of years (about 300 millions of years, some up to 600 millions), even way longer than humans existed (300 000 for a primitive Homo Sapiens). Yeah, it\u2019s of biological origin but nature learned to function without. And now we put it in the atmosphere in just a few hundred years.<br><br>Wild pigs are similar to cows, it\u2019s part of a cycle and according to regenerative agriculture, they can even help store CO2 in the soil. Methane CH4 (one carbon \u201catom of life\u201d, four of hydrogen, also found in water) degrades itself into CO2 (one carbon, two oxygen). Sure, it isn\u2019t the most climate friendly because it takes time to degrade (10 years I heard). But where does the CH4 of cows come from? Grass. And what does grass do? Take CO2 from the atmosphere. If you can graze the fields in the right way, you encourage the grass to store CO2 in the ground.

Most of the new H1N1 isolates in eggs were found to be temperature sensitive.&quot;<br><br>&quot;When antigenic and molecular characterization of this virus showed that both the  HA and NA antigens were remarkably similar to those of the 1950s, this finding had profound  implications.  Where  had  the  virus  been  that  it was  relatively  unchanged  after  20  years?  If  serially  (and cryptically)  transmitted  in  humans,  antigenic  drift  should have led to many changes after 2 decades.&quot;<br><br>A 2006 paper claimed to have isolated H1N1 influenza virus RNA from ice and melt-water from Siberian lakes that were frequented by migratory birds.<br><a href=\"https://journals.asm.org/doi/full/10.1128/JVI.00986-06\">https://journals.asm.org/doi/full/10.1128/JVI.00986-06</a><br><br>A paper highly critical of the 2006 Siberian Lake paper was published in 2008, presenting strong evidence that the reported isolation of influenza RNA from nature was the result of contamination in the laboratory by the standard reference strain of human H1N1 virus (isolated in 1933) that was used as a positive control in that laboratory. <br><a href=\"https://journals.asm.org/doi/full/10.1128/JVI.02207-07\">https://journals.asm.org/doi/full/10.1128/JVI.02207-07</a><br><br>The speculation that the 1977 release may have been related to H1N1 vaccine research is supported by the observation that in the initial outbreaks in China, nine of the ten viral isolates expressed \u201ctemperature sensitivity\u201d (Kung 1978).  Temperature sensitivity normally an uncommon trait, but one that was in the 1970s (and still is) a fundamental trait for making live attenuated influenza vaccines. Temperature sensitivity generally occurs only after a series of substantial laboratory manipulations and selections. The low severity of the 1977 pandemic might be in part due to the temperature sensitivity of the virus, a trait that limits virus replication in pulmonary tissues.", "comment_date": "2021-07-23T21:18:48Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Jord The Canadian", "comment_text": "Vegetales answered this question decades ago \ud83c\udf45", "comment_date": "2021-07-23T21:18:21Z", "likes_count": 6}, {"comment_by": "Lyndsay Brown", "comment_text": "Why do you show cute piglets as you tell us of their destruction!?", "comment_date": "2021-07-23T21:18:15Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Maurice Johnson", "comment_text": "So you are telling me to eat more bacon.
