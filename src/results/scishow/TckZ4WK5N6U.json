If its fragrant, it&#39;s ripe; if it is less so, it is under-ripe and if it is too fragrant it is far gone or has gone mealy. Sometimes mealiness is hard to detect, but with practice you notice it has a different scent. Some fruits are easier than others. Try with soft fruit, oranges and bananas first, then apples are a good next step.<br>How I store my fruits:<br>Store in fridge at purchase (2C/35F): Blueberries, raspberries, grapes, oranges (sometimes), Strawberries<br>Store at room temp (21C/70F): Bananas, oranges, Melons (Pepos) Apples, nectarines, peaches, plums<br><br>Why? Because when I buy fruit I chow down on that stuff quickly. Fruit that is quick to perish goes in the fridge. Always buy and use fruit straight away or as soon as it goes ripe. I almost never have a fruit go grainy and sad on me except for the rare case I lazily don&#39;t check or smell the fruit beforehand.", "comment_date": "2020-02-25T20:06:59Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "CPU", "comment_text": "CORONAVIRUS", "comment_date": "2020-02-25T19:49:37Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "CPU", "comment_text": "CORONAVIRUS", "comment_date": "2020-02-25T19:49:23Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Principal Skinner", "comment_text": "No one uses the term mealy.
