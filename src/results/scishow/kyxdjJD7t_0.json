First, our records date back only into the 1700s and we have only reached a point where we have actual  world wide coverage in the 20th century. Also,  we know for a fact that the Medieval warming period was several degrees warmer than the average temperature today. Third, several of those record temperature readings are a fraction of a degree higher than the last record and fell within the margin of error, meaning that they really weren&#39;t an increase in temperature - it just sounds more scary if you tell half the story. <br>Also, the issue of whether climate change is man made or not is not settled. Reference back to the afore mentioned Medieval warming period with no carbon emissions to blame. At least one study (supported by data) demonstrated that the relationship between warming and CO2 levels is the inverse of what science is proposing: the climate got warmer and then the CO2 levels rose in response throughout history. There are a fair number of climatologists who correctly attribute warming and cooling mainly to solar activity. That position  doesn&#39;t get you press time or research dollars like a good scary theory that we&#39;re all going to die, unfortunately, so you don&#39;t hear that side on the &quot;If it bleeds, it leads&quot; news programs. An alternative explanation to the greenhouse effect theories is that the temperature really isn&#39;t rising in any significant way, but that the places we take the temperature have changed from rural settings with the cooling effects of trees and plants to the heat retaining concrete canyons of urban and suburban civilization.", "comment_date": "2022-05-24T08:14:50Z", "likes_count": 3}, {"comment_by": "Jorden Penitch", "comment_text": "You Americans shoulda listened to al gore", "comment_date": "2022-05-24T07:57:25Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "\u042e\u043b\u0438\u044f \u041e\u0441\u0442\u0440\u043e\u0432\u043e\u043a", "comment_text": "I didn&#39;t notice that anything got hotter.

You don&#39;t know me but I wanted to spread the good truth of Jesus Christ and I encourage that you stay and learn more\u2764\u271d\ufe0f.\u00a0 See God created the first of humankind and gave our first descendants dominion over the earth and things in it but we soon rebelled against God and so sin was born into the knowledge and actions of humankind. Thankfully enough we have the opportunity to rid ourselves of sin and reconcile with God the holy father through the death and resurrection of Jesus Christ the son of God. He died on the cross for our sins and took the punishment we were supposed to receive, defeating sin in the process and freeing whosoever seeks salvation in him.. giving unto them a new and beautiful life with him as a born again child of God. I would love to see each and every single person on this earth receive salvation and avoid eternal damnation so I spread the good news in hopes that I can get as many people to repent and receive Christ before his second coming. The kingdom of God is near. I pray that who ever reads this considers a life in Christ and repents from the wickedness of this world before it&#39;s too late. We don&#39;t have much time.\u00a0I urge you please get right with the one true living God.Jesus loves you and so do I &lt;3 Be blessed my loves&lt;\\3<br>JOHN 3:15 -21<br>MARK 1:15", "comment_date": "2022-05-23T21:27:55Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Tenebrousoul", "comment_text": "At this point, I will be glad to see humanity go extinct.", "comment_date": "2022-05-23T21:26:55Z", "likes_count": 8}, {"comment_by": "Kal-El Of Krypton", "comment_text": "Everything you state is opposite to the given situations.
