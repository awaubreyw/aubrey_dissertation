Is natural selection sending viruses our way (Covid-19), and the ones with less sting proteins and survive this going to lead humans to evolve to have the human version of an n overclocked interferon alpha production system? OR will we evolve and find a better balance, because like you mentioned, too much of one thing is not helpful, bats don&#39;t do well on some of the things we do. Question to ponder, can sheer human will (the power of thought) actively change our own DNA over lives / over generations? The computational performance of overclocked hardware is evident: Wouldn&#39;t that be the path humans evolve toward next? Do we think that a merger of technology and human medical knowledge is the path forward?

So basically, when bats do get viruses, they\u2019re able to quickly clear them out\u2026 for the most part. They can still fall prey to at least a few, like the rabies virus. And even quick suppression of a virus can mean it stays around\r<br>in a group of bats. Bats tend to huddle close together when they roost. Plus, they fly around in the same areas as bats from other colonies, and they\u2019re constantly spraying snot and saliva everywhere when they echolocate. So there\u2019s a good chance that, during that window when a bat has a\r virus that is actively replicating, it will spread it to another bat. That means even if each bat only hosts a virus for a short time, it can linger in the population. And even this probably isn\u2019t the full picture.<br>Mathematical models indicate that, by themselves, bats\u2019 social habits\r don\u2019t completely explain why they host so many viruses. Instead, research suggests that the viruses themselves have figured out how to lie dormant and undiscovered\u2014like in the bats\u2019 lungs, spleens, or intestines. And then, when the bat gets stressed\u2014like when it\u2019s roused from hibernation\u2014that stress temporarily dampens <br>its anti-virus systems, allowing any hidden viruses to emerge. This leads to another period of increased viral replication and shedding. <br>--So again, the bat can transfer the infection to other animals. Then, its antiviral systems get back up to speed, and the viruses are eliminated or driven back into hiding. Still, even when a virus is replicating and being shed, bats generally don\u2019t seem sick\u2014not like a person would\r with the same virus. And that\u2019s likely because their inflammation-dampeners are still running.<br>--And that may also be why viruses that are deadly to us\r aren\u2019t lethal to them. It turns out that the most severe symptoms of illnesses <br>like MERS and Ebola, the symptoms usually responsible for their lethality aren\u2019t caused by what the virus itself does to the body. <br>Instead, they\u2019re the result of the destructive, catastrophic inflammation the virus triggers. This includes an extreme systemic reaction called a cytokine storm,\r where an over-release of pro-inflammatory signaling proteins  turns a person\u2019s own immune system into their worst enemy. And some researchers think that our aggravated inflammatory response may actually be because these viruses have evolved to dodge the super-refined immune systems of bats.<br>--Basically, they evolved to survive in a host that constantly\r and aggressively attacks their ability to replicate. So when that assault is suddenly weaker in a new host, they go wild and produce a lot of little virus babies that send the host\u2019s immune system into panic mode.<br>This kind of overreaction can also happen to bats. It\u2019s just not usually in response to viruses.<br>--Instead, it seems like their unique immune system\r may leave them vulnerable to non-viral invaders. The most infamous example of this is White Nose Syndrome, a fungal pathogen which has devastated bat populations in North America. Some researchers think the bats\u2019 dampening of inflammation \u2014especially during hibernation\u2014makes it easy for the fungus to infect the bat. Then, once the bat awakes, it\u2019s immune system does react\u2014only, it goes too far, which can lead to the bat developing a life-threatening form of systemic  inflammation. So, basically, the reason they die from white nose is similar to why we die from viruses like MERS and Ebola. <br>--That may mean that the key to saving bats from this fungus\r (and us, from the deadly viruses they carry) may lie in further research on bats. And also, if we\u2019re being selfish, we have a lot of other diseases\r characterized by inflammation, like heart disease and diabetes. <br>So studying their inflammation system may lead to treatments for our chronic conditions. And the same goes for studies on the ways that bats keep viruses at bay. Right now, we only have effective antiviral drugs for about 10 of the more than 200 viruses that can infect humans, and very few broad-spectrum antivirals. If we can discover more of bats\u2019 tricks, we might be able to use them to develop therapies against the diseases they host and other dangerous viruses. Plus, all this research might help us live longer. Many researchers think bats\u2019 immunological adaptations are also behind some of their other superpowers, like how they seem to rarely get cancer, or how they live incredibly long lives for animals of their size. Usually, little animals live fast and die young. But Brandt&#39;s bats can live for over 40 years even though they only weigh 4 to 8 grams! So instead of looking at bats as species zero, we should think of them as flying keys to longevity and resilience.

So it seems that the current coronavirus went from bats to pangolins, which were then sold at the wet wildlife markets as health-promoting food according to traditional Chinese medicine, despite poaching pangolins being illegal. I don&#39;t think banning all bat eating will do much, because nearly every one of the diseases originating from bats are hopping onto humans through intermediate host (e.g. primates in Ebola).

It made kind of sense for bacteria, since they are self-sustaining life forms. They may just accidentally destroy an optimal environment from overpopulation, but then still be able to find a new home. Viruses however are directly dependant on a living host for reproduction. It seemed weird that they didn&#39;t evolve in a more environmental friendly way.
