Best piece of advice generally speaking have them knock you out make you unconscious incubate you whatever it&#39;s mostly uncomfortable until you hit a certain point where you&#39;re just sort of blacking out and you see black stars maybe a light or whatever.  But if you have the option And you&#39;re pretty sure it&#39;s gonna happen anyway you don&#39;t want to be awake for it. Have them knock you out incubate you whatever. I just recently got out of the hospital after about 3 weeks It was very touch and go. My lungs were surrounded by fluid my liver had basically shut down my heart was having issues my sodium level was way too low my abdomen was full of fluid and they couldn&#39;t do really anything about it with my sodium level so low otherwise I&#39;d probably have a heart attack so Yeah there was a lot of back-and-forth getting albumen and blood platelets  trying to stabilize things. I Had an infection from my cat scratching me of all things and it ran rampant through my system for a while it was in my blood and in the fluid around my lungs I went septic  I was in excruciating pain And very much in-and-out I asked to be knocked out and they wouldn&#39;t do it because they said it was too risky I said I don&#39;t care if I die I&#39;m not all that concerned as long as I don&#39;t feel it.

The land isn&#39;t allowed to go back to nature necessarily in order to remain a place for family to mourn and some physical reminder to remain. As we bury more and more people who would like those monuments, would this create problems in the future? I know that this probably isn&#39;t entirely consistent across all forms of Islam and Judaism and across all regions and cultures and all versions of natural burial, but it seems to be a visible enough practice that it has affected my perception.

Not to mention Book was an exceptionally good shot, being a <b>fictional</b> character and all, and almost any real life person would miss such a small target, especially when in a combat/self-defense situation. When you point a gun at someone, you do so with the intent to kill them. Own that. Take it deadly seriously. Do you really intend to end another human being&#39;s life? If not, do not point a gun at them. And if you absolutely must, aim for center mass and come to terms with it before pulling the trigger. It&#39;s that simple. If you have to shoot someone for ANY reason (and it had better be in the defense of life and/or the liberty of your country), the one excuse the cops should never hear you utter is, &quot;I didn&#39;t intend to kill them.&quot;<br><br>Cremation is definitely more eco-friendly than all those embalming chemicals they pump into bodies to make them smell nice at the funeral, and more eco-friendly than the fiberglass and plastic coffins and polyester suits they put in the ground. A newer type of burial puts you naked inside a pod with a sapling growing out of it. Trees are often planted in the memory of loved ones, and it&#39;s been shown that a naturally decomposing body is absolutely delicious to a tree. Its roots will even grow in the shape of the body it&#39;s consuming. I plan on being buried wearing cotton and in a 100% biodegradable coffin.

But in reality they don\u2019t know what they are and if the brain could take hours before dying after body death. When confronted in front of a so-called brain-dead patient, they hide the fact that often, even with no signs of consciousness and pain, the patient show brain activity! But because this activity isn\u2019t similar to the one of a live body, they say that they are useless and that the patient is dead. These liars bother me so much that i refuse to give my organs, no knowing if i would be still alive or not. Each time i see a walk of honour, i am wondering if the patient is not conscious, even a little, and is trying to alert his family before being vivisectioned, without anesthesia.

However, a lot of the casket choices involve varnishes and paints that can be harmful to the ground&#39;s ecosystem and may even result in some poisoning of the ground water. There&#39;s also the embalming process which slows the decay process of the body - good for if you need to postpone the funeral so everyone can come say goodbye, but generally not needed for most funerals with open caskets as they&#39;re usually held within a few days to a week. I&#39;ve heard some say that embalming fluid can poison the ground, but I&#39;m not entirely sure that&#39;s completely accurate.
