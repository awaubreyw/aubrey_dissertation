For instance if you accidentally touch something hot enough to burn you your spinal chord will reflexively jerk your hand away prior to your brain even receiving the pain signal, i.e. you would react to the pain even if you lacked a brain entirely. Meaning something can feel pain, and react as such, without necessarily experiencing that consciously like we do.<br><br>Just to drive it home even more I&#39;ll give an analogous example: you could design a robotic system with sensors that detect damage or imminent damage, and program it to react to that in a protective manner. At our current technological level that would be fairly rudimentary and certainly not at the level of conscious experience, it may be as simple even as a temperature/pressure sensor and a motor set to pull the arm away if conditions reached damaging levels. Clearly this simple machine is not experiencing pain, however it would be acting in exactly the same way as if it did.<br><br>Therfore the real struggle here is identifying whether or not a lobster is simply feeling pain, or experiencing pain.", "comment_date": "2022-07-28T04:11:05Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "sans dreamurr", "comment_text": "I do enjoy boiling em alive better knowing they feel pain, thank you", "comment_date": "2022-07-27T19:31:43Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Wandi Lande", "comment_text": "Vegans", "comment_date": "2022-07-27T16:27:40Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Spy", "comment_text": "So the lobster that jumped into frying oil got deepfried ?", "comment_date": "2022-07-27T14:01:46Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Majoras", "comment_text": "I dont care!", "comment_date": "2022-07-27T10:26:02Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Mariya Bell", "comment_text": "like when men invented chainsaws to assist women in birth. &quot;Don&#39;t worry, they don&#39;t feel pain like we do&quot;", "comment_date": "2022-07-27T02:11:31Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Reese Richardson", "comment_text": "Don&#39;t care what my food feels", "comment_date": "2022-07-27T01:26:04Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Federico Musci", "comment_text": "i dont care about the lobster i just want to eat", "comment_date": "2022-07-26T23:41:01Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Lustful Capella Dio", "comment_text": "I dont really care about lobsters though, like if they feel all that pain I dont really care, they\u2019d rip me apart and eat me bottom to up if they could so why should I show them sympathy", "comment_date": "2022-07-26T17:26:26Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Jordan Morris", "comment_text": "It&#39;s clearly obvious that they feel pain... they rub their antennas but don&#39;t when they have been numbed pretty conclusive evidence but I gue.....

Like how difficult is it to assume, if you boil a thing alive, wich will kill it, it won\u2018t have a painful reaction to it wich is a thing so the animal will avoid that area like the plague. You know, how pain works? Like if someone sat you in some walled off mini forest and then turned on a lighter and roasted you in some mini forest fire how\u2018d you feel if some alien then concluded your screeching doesn\u2018t mean you\u2018re in distress just cause they don\u2018t screech when they are. Like come on! If you don\u2018t know if you\u2018ll potentially torture another creature, then don\u2018t do it! Don\u2018t take the risk! We don\u2018t experiment on babies even though they couldn\u2018t tell us they don\u2018t constent? So why do it to other species if there\u2018s some<br>Chance it may not be the horrible thing actually? Like no! As long as a creature shows clear avoidant behavior be it trying to cover itself, run away, get stressed or anything else that hints towards it being avoidant of the situation, just don\u2018t take the risk and roll in your own ambiguity telling yourself you totally didn\u2018t torture an animal to death cause you couldn\u2018t tell if you did so clearly. Like no! You have the brain capacity to not thing like a cruel, instinct driven animal, you have the ability to chose to not kill in the most horrible ways when it comes to animal products, so do that stuff ethically! You\u2018re not a lion or a bear! You\u2018re supposed to be smart and capable of using that to protect other life and minimize their suffering! Don\u2018t let your superior intelligence be in vain! If we\u2018re the only animal capable of considering stuff like saving other species from death or killing them for food in the most<br>Painless way then do that! Be good! Use your<br>Human advantage and turn it into praxis! Don\u2018t fall back on \u201ebut it\u2018s nature!\u201c it\u2018s not your nature to dumb yourself down or throw out your morals when it comes to \u201eimterfering with nature\u201c i mean god damn! You\u2018re not above other animals! So don\u2018t exclude yourself from the animal kingdom. Use your ability for good! Cause if we don\u2018t do it and waste our potential for kindness towards other species, nobody else will do it for us! You\u2018re part of nature, stop thinking you\u2018re above it and take some responsibility! Cause if you\u2018d save your pet from a fall or a python or something, you shouldn\u2018t look away and be like: \u201ei won\u2018t interfere with nature\u201c when it\u2018s a wild animal. It\u2018s your human nature to be able to help them! And if you don\u2018t because you\u2018re too cocky and think you\u2018re above interspecies kindness, then don\u2018t call yourself above nature!

Some country&#39;s have banned the boiling of lobsters with the growing evidence of pain in shellfish. According to the animal welfare charity RSPCA, the most humane way to kill a lobster is-<br><br>Stunning the crustacean by chilling it in cold air or cold water shellfish or an ice slurry - saltwater or freshwater, according to the species to not cause shock - for at least 20 minutes<br><br>Once the lobster is stunned, it should be mechanically killed as quickly as possible, says the RSPCA, by splitting it along the longitudinal midline on its underside.

Our brains are what process pain and make us understand \u201cthis hurts\u201d lobsters lack that function. The most logical explanation is that lobsters feel stress and stimuli that causes a reaction but they lack the function to actually feel pain.
