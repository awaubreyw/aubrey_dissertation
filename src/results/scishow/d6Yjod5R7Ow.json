The doctors are simply unprepared to give up and have that very frank, honest discussion with patients. Too many doctors get so focused on extending the time the patient had left that they totally ignore the quality of life. Too often, families and patients don\u2019t realize until it\u2019s too late that instead of grasping at more time, they should have focused on using the time they did have to enjoy one another.

But to tell that patient and her spouse things like \u201cwell we do have patients who have lived for 20 years after GBM/ODG\u201d without qualifying that comment can cause utter hell. I knew what  the numbers were. I knew what her underlying issues were. I knew she was not going to be a 20 year survivor. I let my dad and mom leave the exam room and cornered the doctor to ask if he really thought there was any chance for my mom, and automatically he looked at the ground and couldn\u2019t speak. My comment was simple, do not give them false hope. My parents had been together since school.

There is no dispute regarding the definition of cancer amongst professionals. If it is cancer, then it is malignant. The technical term you are looking for is \u201cneoplasm,\u201d which includes cancer as well as non-cancerous lesions and hyperplastic (abnormal) cells. Doctors may refer to a neoplasm as \u201ccancer\u201d just to simplify medical lingo for lay people, but the difference is well understood; your statement of finding a bunch of cancers over the years is completely incorrect. <br><br><br><br>Second, your video purports that the reason why everyone isn\u2019t getting cancer is because all the \u201charmless cancers\u201d found from overdiagnosis would just go away on their own. This is a flat out lie. There are (very few) papers that HYPOTHESIZE the regression of certain tumors as a reason for overdiagnosis, but to suggest that this is a commonplace occurrence is incredibly harmful and misleading. While spontaneous tumor regression is a documented phenomenon, it is INCREDIBLY rare (as in 1 in 100,000 cases). This is possibly caused by immune surveillance (your immune system recognizing the cancer and destroying it). When it comes to immune surveillance, it does indeed play a significant part in preventing cancer; this is a widely accepted fact, but the immune system\u2019s function in cancer prevention happens on the level of single cells, not on the level of tumors that are already detectable by imaging. <br><br><br><br>Finally, you discuss indolent cancers as if they were harmless cancers.

It does not mean that they don\u2019t cause symptoms, and it does not mean that they will go away by themselves. Indolent cancers do kill, and they must be treated depending on the patient. If the patient is very old and is unlikely to live 10 years, for example, then it would be pointless to treat the patient because the cancer is indolent.

Did you know that Cancer is easier to cure than influenza? Without exception, all Cancer cells are unregulated cells. The endogenous Cannabinoids require functioning receptors to communicate with cells and in the case of cancer cells, the receptors are broken. PhytoCannabinoids do not require functioning receptors and can enter a cell via any hole such as a calcium or potassium gateway and thereby induce a logic check on the cell. If the cell is existing past it&#39;s expiration date or is beyond repair: then it is recycled by a process called Apoptosis. Apoptosis means &#39;Programmed Cell Death&#39;. The human body actually destroys many unregulated cells, every day. The only difference between a cancer cell and an unregulated cell is that the cancer cell is no longer compatible with the endogenous cannabinoids, due to the lacking of receptors. Personally, I&#39;ve known 5 people with terminal cancer. Only 1 skipped Chemo and just used Cannabis Oil. He just used an alcoholic extract of the flower oil (Rick Simpson Oil). He spent 10 months in prison, away from his wife and two kids, as he wrote to his family and friends on social media about being free from cancer and then he got raided by the kind police but luckily the charges were dropped as the legal system was more interested in his case not getting media attention due to the doctors having documentation that covered the entire timeline, from diagnosis to cure. The other 4 cancer victims I know, at least two of them spent up to 100k on chemo and light therapy and did not use Cannabis and they died legally. So, science says die legally or save yourself illegally. I bet globalists funded this episode. It gets 5 smiles from Bill Gates. Personally, I think Cancer is a way for thieves to steal your money and kill you. Cancer is so easy to cure it is ridiculous, they rob you of your money through a legal process of treatments and then you die. It is like money laundering except the eugenicists get a stiffy at the fact that you are dying because they with-held vital information from you, in regards to how your body works and where supplemental cannabinoids can be located. I mean, the endogenous cannabinoid system was well documented but not even acknowledged by Universities until a few years ago - despite it governing many aspects of the body.
