I don&#39;t typically like to comment in general, let alone on these things. That being said, here is a semi-long winded response. <b>*Quick disclaimer, I don&#39;t claim to be a spokes person for any of these institutions or groups, however I do belong to the ACSM.*</b> 10,000 steps. Do we need it? You answered the question partially. It&#39;s a lot harder than a yes or no answer. There is some statistical evidence that 10,000 steps a day will reduce the chances of a cardiovascular event {Kraus, W. E., &amp; Janz, K. F. (2019). Daily Step Counts for Measuring Physical Activity Exposure and Its Relation to Health. Official Journal of the College of Sports Medicine, 1206\u20131212.} Not only that, but it&#39;s a relatively easy number to remember and can be effectively communicated to the masses as an easier way to meet the US Health Guidelines  of weekly activity needed for adults { Le-Masurier, G. C., Sidman, C. L., &amp; Corbin, C. B. (2003). Accumulating 10,000 Steps: Does this Meet Current Physical Activity Guidelines? Research Quarterly for Exercise and Sport, 74, 389\u2013394.} The problem you&#39;re trying to solve in this video is &quot;does it actually work biologically?&quot; but neglecting &quot;does it actually work socially?&quot;. 10,000 steps through some of these studies  shows that this number is significant enough to achieve the daily and weekly recommended exercise guidelines. This isn&#39;t supported by metadata, but I can tell you as someone who works in this field that it&#39;s a lot more effective to tell patients/clients to work 10,000 steps daily into  life then it is to get them to engage in purposeful exercise. I&#39;m not the only one who has seen this, however I will say this is anecdotal evidence as I can&#39;t find a study on purposeful exercise vs step counts and the adherence rate thereof.  So what am I trying to say? The TL;DR of this comment is to help you realize that 10,000 steps isn&#39;t necessarily wrong when it comes to cardiac health, HOWEVER it is easier in my personal experience to effectively communicate  and keep adherence to 10,000 steps daily as enough exercise  than it is to get clients/patients to do purposeful exercise. It&#39;s a fallback answer. Yes, exercise is great and I encourage you to do it! But if you refuse, at <b>least</b> get 10,000 steps a day to meet close to daily health guidelines established in the second cited article. Thanks guys, sorry for the long comment.

If your work is strenuous and your heart rate is elevated then sure, the steps could count then too. Just remember this is a bare minimum to recieve small health benefits. 30 mins of moderate to vigorous exercise 3 times a week is way better than just counting your steps.
