An old electrical trick is to work with one hand on your belt. The ideology is only one hand will be in use. Because if the circuit is going from hand to hand, it\u2019s passing right through your heart and can potentially be fatal. Voltage does play a big key but IMO the biggest factor is actually amperage draw. Most people don\u2019t understand that electricity is pulled not pushed, so the more electricity is being pulled the more electricity will be flowing through the circuit you\u2019re shocked from. Higher voltage can be nerve racking but there\u2019s a good chance it\u2019ll have enough power to blow you off of the circuit, where as 120v \u201clow voltage\u201d doesn\u2019t have enough power to knock you off of the circuit, sometimes you\u2019re able to get off of the circuit but I\u2019ve personally been stuck on a circuit for over 10 seconds. By far one of the scariest experiences I\u2019ve encountered. The fact that you know what\u2019s going on, you know you can potentially die if you don\u2019t get off, and you can\u2019t do anything about it because every muscle in your body is contracting.

I almost died from being electrocuted...we moved a lot, and I was 9yo grew up in Australia for a few years. We had 240v Electricity. My stepdad was a wannabe electrician. He Warned us kids not to touch these electric wires that were powerful enough to kill cats. He installed them on our bird Avairy. Long story short, I was stuck on the wires, my hands clenched shut on the wires, I couldn\u2019t move, couldn\u2019t yell out. The sound of being electrocuted deafens with intense buzzing. I couldn\u2019t do a damn thing, but think over the loud noise of a way to get off the wires. I tried and tried and tried. I was finally able to get one hand off but it violently latched onto my other arm. Then I woke up on the ground. I didn\u2019t know how I wasn\u2019t on the wires anymore, I didn\u2019t know why I was on the ground. I could not get up. <br>It felt like I didn\u2019t have any muscles anymore. I felt extremely nauseous. I just laid there and passed out again. I woke up again and tried to get up, I still couldn\u2019t. I don\u2019t know how long I was electrocuted for, I don\u2019t know how long I was passed out for. I stayed laying there until I felt like I could get up. I was able to get up on all 4\u2019s, very wobbly though. I\u2019m tried to stand but couldn\u2019t. So I laid back down. Eventually I could, made my way to the house a 1/4 acre away, had to keep stopping to lay down. <br>I made it to the door, crawled in and my grandmother started by saying \u201cWhere have you...\u201d she looked at me and gasped, and said \u201cWhat happened to you?\u201d I said I\u2019d been electrocuted. She said I had no color anywhere at all. I went to my bedroom and laid down.I heard my grandmother yell to my mom that I was electrocuted. My mother yells out to my stepdad that I was electrocuted. Some time went by and my stepdad came into my room, sat on my bed ( he never did that before) and said I was extremely lucky to be alive. I told him I didn\u2019t feel lucky at all. He asked me how I broke the wire. I said I didn\u2019t. I didn\u2019t know the wire was broke. He said I must have been stuck on the wire a long time, because the electrical panel caught fire. The electrical panel that caught fire was older than me at the time, it looked like it was from the 1950\u2019 or earlier. I was out of commission for about 2 weeks. <br><br>As I got older i Learned a bit more. I found out, that if you go unconscious or die while being electrocuted, you still get electrocuted because the connection isn\u2019t severed. So, the last thing I remember was getting the one hand off the wire and it thrust onto my other arm. So, how did I end up on the ground? How did the wire break? That\u2019s what I tried to figure out. Technically, the type of electrical panel had no safety features, so I should have been stuck there forever until the electrical connection was severed. <br>What I had initially forgot was, my stepdad told me that the electrical panel caught fire. <br>I talked with an electrician about it, he was more concerned with my stepdads wiring technique lol But he told  me that the reason I was able to get a hand off the wire was when the electrical panel sparked, then reconnected. The most likely explanation for me being on the ground and why the wire was broken, he explained that after the spark at the panel, it eventually caught fire, severing the connection. He said I was mostly likely unconscious while being electrocuted, when the connection was severed from the fire, I dropped to the ground. He said in theory I should be dead. He said he wouldn\u2019t be surprised if what my stepdad did was illegal at the time. <br>To this day, I hate electricity. But I have no choice to use it. I\u2019m pretty sure I have ptsd from it.<br><br>I wish it happened just like a movie portrays an electrocution.", "comment_date": "2020-07-11T08:46:21Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Naveen Noel", "comment_text": "Wearing a rubber sole is advisable but isn&#39;t it like trapping electricity in our bodies?
