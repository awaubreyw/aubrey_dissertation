If the chair is much bigger than the wavelength then it will reflect, experience some absorption, and possibly have some transmission depending on the chair.

The Quetzal-sounding reflections are a result of progressively delayed reflections with temporal-spacing just outside the Hass window.<br><br>It\u2019s a psychoacoustic phenomena, whereby the brain has limited temporal resolution for sound (drastically so at lower frequencies). If two sounds occur within ~25ms of each other (the Hass window), the brain cannot distinguish them as individual events. In this case, the individual reflections mimic the pressure peaks of a non-composite sound, and the brain thus interprets them a single, rising pitch. It is rising because the horizontal distance between the steps is decreasing as distance of the steps from the sound source-listener is increasing. Thus, the later (more distant) reflections are spaced progressively more tightly\u2014corresponding to higher pitched \u201ccomposite-reflections\u201d.<br><br>Diffraction has little to do with it, beyond filling in some of the sound energy between these reflection peaks by blurring the total reflected energy of each step across time. (Sound travels directly to the higher step, but also diffracts around the top corner of the step below thus taking an infinite series of longer paths before hitting the face of the upper step. But most of that energy is reflected above the listener, so it\u2019s not a primary driver of the acoustic properties at play.)<br><br>Your overall representation of what makes the acoustics of these structures was pretty lacking from my perspective.

That is, the research participants grew-up in a context being taught that male is the voice of authority, of reason, of learning, and of that which is important in the world. Often too, we are taught that women&#39;s voice have nothing important to say, that they are &#39;too high&#39; and &#39;too squeaky&#39; or some other &#39;insert-insult-here too&#39;, and that these female voices can be ignored (e.g. how often in a meeting is a woman&#39;s comment dismissed when the man is praised for <b>repeating the same comment</b> moments later?). This conditioning almost necessarily would have an impact on how these research-participant listeners responded to the frequencies of sound that they were exposed to during the research. <br><br>As it happens, depending on when the structures were built, the people from those times likely also grew-up being conditioned to believe that the male voice is the voice of reason, authority, and in fact in many cases of &#39;normal human&#39; or even just &#39;human&#39; as women were not considered to even be people but were rather chattel in those days. These people, however, lacked the mass media that make the conditioning so wide-spread in our times. <br><br>So, does it really put people in a spiritual mood or are we just responding to a noise that we have been conditioned to respond to as being &#39;worth listening too&#39;?

Anyways, you guys should totally do some entire episodes on Mesoamerican science and engineering or history on Crash Course. It&#39;s a part of the world  most people are ignorant of, but they did amazing things. As an example, the Aztec had formal taxonomy for plants and flowers, and had experimental botanical gardens were plants were studied and bred for medical uses and other proprieties and categorized. They had a huge corpus of herbal treatments and other medicine, with multiple Spanish people, such as Cortes and even the Spanish Royal Court Physician/Naturalist Francisco Hern\u00e1ndez de Toledo (who visited Mexico to document and learn Aztec medicne and botany) admitting Aztec medicine was superior to their own. We have a variety of surviving texts on Aztec medicine, surgical techniques (which included skin grafts) and botany, such as the Badianus Manuscript and certain voluems of the Florentine Codex. It&#39;s been suggested that the presence of academic botanical gardens in Europe starting over the next century or so were influenced from Aztec examples. <br><br>They were also pioneers with public health and sanitation and sustainability: Tenochtitlan, the Aztec captial, had every street and building washed daily (even commoners also bathe regularly and were expected to wash their hands, face, and teeth multiple times a day) by a fleet of civil servents who also collected waste from toilets around the city to be reused as dyes and fertilizer; with gardens being built into various parts of the cities and noble homes to ward off smells. The city was also made up of artificial islands with canals between them which used local soils and tree species (the trees anchoring the soil into the lakebed) which both provided a very productive agricultural yield, acted as breakers to control floods and wind damage, and were bioactive. <br><br>Complex water mangement systems in general were pretty common for Mesoamerican cities: Even the earliest complex site, San Lorenzo, has some undergound pipe systems, with other Olmec cities having some aquaduct and drainage systems as well. The Maya of TIkal had huge public rainwater collection reservoirs (as well as individual ones for specific households) with canal systems between them for drainage for overflow, alongside dikes; and the streets, buildings, etc had channels and drains built into them to redirect the water from rain into grids of channels to move water into agricultural land. It also had  aqueducts with multiple paths and switching stations to change which way they delivered water, all of which formed an interconnected system, with smaller resvoirs and canal systems strategically placed out for hundreds of square miles in a suburban sprawl. Another Maya city, Palenque, had a similarly complex systtem, but more to move water out then in: there wer 56 springs nearby or in the city, colleascing into 9 streams/river that cut through it&#39;s layout, so it had a massive interconnected systems of aquaducts, undergound pipes running undernaths plazas buildings, and streets, canals, pooling basins, etc. At least one of these was pressurized to make a large fountain, and the city had some toilets. <br><br>Probably the coolest Mesoamerican water system was the watering system for the royal retreat for kings of the Aztec city of Texcoco: It sourced water from mountain springs 5 miles away with a giant aqueduct (in some places being 200 feet above ground), brought it to a hill where the water flowed into a network of basins and channels to control the flow speed, at which it traveled across another channel over a large gorge to a second hill (Texcotzingo itself)  where this channel formed a circle around the hill&#39;s summit, filling a series of pools fountains, shrines, and then dropping below in artificial waterfalls to water the gardens below, which also had different sections emulating different biomes. There&#39;s TONS of other examples (Teotihuacan could flood one of it&#39;s plazas like the Roman Colosseum for rituals) of water systems, so i&#39;ll leave it at that for those. <br><br>Speaking of the Maya, though, the Maya city of Yaxchilan may have had the world&#39;s first true suspension bridge: It&#39;s up in the air, but some reconstructions of the bridge there (taking some piles of rubble in the river as being the remains of support pillars/suspenders) have it with a level deck span supported by vertical suspenders, just like modern suspension bridges. The Maya also independently invented true hydraluic cement, like the Romans, and obviously Maya mathematics and Astronomy is widely applauded.<br><br>There&#39;s so much more then this: Nixtamalization, for example, but I&#39;d be here all day if I didn&#39;t stop at some point!", "comment_date": "2020-10-11T22:11:39Z", "likes_count": 308}, {"comment_by": "Warren Philips", "comment_text": "Mayan pyramid reflects sound similar to bird call.
