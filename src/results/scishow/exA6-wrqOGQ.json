One of the common effects of polyploidy is that plants get bigger flowers and fruits, and their leaves get bigger and become darker green.

As they mention in the video, having spare sets of chromosomes makes plants less likely to show recessive genetic traits. This is an advantage if a plant lives in an environment where it is vital not to change too fast. For a plant in a cold region it would be a disaster if it lost its winterhardiness in a period of milder winters.

As said in the video the fragaria x ananassa (common strawberry) is descended from the F. Chiloensis and F. Virginia, this was discovered in a botanical garden in france. These species also have some common ancestors and the current theory is that the strawberry migrated from asia to America and went from 2n to 3n then 3n to 6n and 6n to 8n. The 2&gt;3 step was within one species then two 3n species mated without reducing their chromosome count forming a 6n and lastly e 2n mated with the 6n without reducing. It seems that the strawberry has a naturally high rate of not reducing their genome.<br><br>It was really difficult to distinguish between the chromosomes using standard genotyping methods.
