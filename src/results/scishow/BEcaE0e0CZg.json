He was killed, and three days later He rose from the dead. Forty days later He ascended into heaven where He sits at the right hand of the Father. He is returning very soon, but before He does, Satan, the devil, is coming to pretend to be Jesus. Satan is an angel, and he will have certain supernatural powers with which to try to fool everyone. He will, for example, be able to make fire come down from heaven in the sight of men. He will only be on earth a short time before the real King of Kings, Jesus Christ, God in the flesh, returns. When the real Jesus comes we will all be transformed into our spiritual bodies at the same moment. Jesus came to offer forgiveness of sins and eternal life to anyone who believes and calls on His precious name.\r<br>\r<br>For all have sinned, and come short of the glory of God; - Romans 3:23 \r<br> \r<br>For the wages of sin is death; but the gift of God is eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord. - Romans 6:23 \r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life. For God sent not his Son into the world to condemn the world; but that the world through him might be saved. He that believeth on him is not condemned: but he that believeth not is condemned already, because he hath not believed in the name of the only begotten Son of God. - John 3:16-18 \r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>Now when Jesus was in Bethany, in the house of Simon the leper, There came unto him a woman having an alabaster box of very precious ointment, and poured it on his head, as he sat at meat. But when his disciples saw it, they had indignation, saying, To what purpose is this waste? For this ointment might have been sold for much, and given to the poor. When Jesus understood it, he said unto them, Why trouble ye the woman? for she hath wrought a good work upon me. For ye have the poor always with you; but me ye have not always. For in that she hath poured this ointment on my body, she did it for my burial. Verily I say unto you, Wheresoever this gospel shall be preached in the whole world, there shall also this, that this woman hath done, be told for a memorial of her. - Matthew 26:6-13 \r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>The blessing of the LORD, it maketh rich, and he addeth no sorrow with it. - Proverbs 10:22\r<br>\r<br> \r<br><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/holybiblekjv\">https://www.facebook.com/holybiblekjv</a>", "comment_date": "2021-12-26T00:03:48Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Mayen N", "comment_text": "My God, this was amazing!

Tru oil (gun stock finisher) I believe is basically just a variation of boiled linseed oil and some other solvent (I think mineral spirits which along with its refined form Naptha is also prone to starting shop fires) that help it dry faster which would make tru oil even more combustible than plain Boiled Linseed oil. I almost used Tru oil to put a thin finish on a telecaster neck last year, probably still will on another project in the future. Anyways I just thought it was cool the video mentioned linseed oil.

One of my kids had spilt some grease moving a skillet. I&#39;m not sure if they tried to clean it or tried to hide that they made a mess. Well my wife always washes and puts the clean pots on the stove. So when she started cooking and the burner got hot enough, the grease caught fire. I woke up to the smoke alarm going off and as I was walking into the kitchen, my wife had a 5lb bag of flour and was in the motion of throwing it on the fire. I saw what she had and started screaming NOOO!!! But it is so hard to stop when you already started. I think we are all like that. The flower was like an explosion of fire and luckily I had a fire extinguisher next to the fridge. So I was able to put it out almost as fast as it started. <br>  I asked her what in the world was she doing? She said that the fire chief that lives next door had said the easiest way of putting a grease fire out. Is by a simple stuff that you have at the house already. She says that she remembers him saying flour!!! I told her, yes baby you probably did hear him say flour. She says you see even you agree. I said yeah I agree that he said NEVER USE FLOUR TO PUT A FIRE OUT!!!  At 11pm she walked next door and woke that old man up to ask him about flour on a grease fire.... I was so embarrassed and trying so hard to apologize to him for her waking him up. She told him that she was not able to sleep until she knew that either she was right or if I was right. The fire chief just said, yeah never use flour to put any kind of fire out especially a grease fire. Flour becomes a fuel that will burn your house down before you can make a call or do anything. She asked him, what did you tell us to use then. He said Baking soda young lady baking soda. I just said thank you and turned to my wife and said, baby can we please go to bed now. The fire chief says yes baby, can I please go back to bed now. Lmao.
