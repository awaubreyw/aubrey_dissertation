The documentary focused in areas on the Pacific side of Central America.<br><br>It was shown that sharks would come-and-go to rest on the freshwater percolating sea bed. While resting the sharks would become lethargic and behave as if under narcotics. After a few hours the sharks would then slowly swim off and revive in salty water. At the time of the documentary the hypothesis was that the sharks eliminated parasites doing these visits.<br><br>The question is; how far do these sharks migrate to these freshwater sources?<br>As for clarity, these weren&#39;t bull sharks (a known shark to occupy fresh and salt water).", "comment_date": "2022-07-16T22:06:35Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "DanH", "comment_text": "If an animal goes extinct it just means they were not cut out to be a part of the current world.
