If it&#39;s the one caused by biting into your cheek, you can use those round cotton thingies for cleaning your make up and put it in between cheek and teeth.

I used mouthwash every time I brushed my teeth, so I figured maybe something in my mouth was protecting me from canker sores, and maybe I was washing it out when I used the mouthwash?<br><br>To test that hypothesis, I quit using mouthwash for a year while continuing to brush my teeth twice a day.  I was surprised that I didn&#39;t have a single canker sore for that entire year.  To further test the idea, I then bought a relatively tame organic mouthwash and used it for a week, and I ended up getting a canker sore at the end of the week.  After that week, I quit using mouthwash altogether and I still brush my teeth with Sensodyne twice a day, and I haven&#39;t had a canker sore for the past two years.<br><br>I can&#39;t guarantee that abstaining from using mouthwash will work for you, but it definitely works for me.  If you try this, make sure you use a toothpaste that doesn&#39;t have any antibiotics in it, and make sure you Only brush your teeth (don&#39;t use any mouthwash or mouth rinse, only rinse with plain water if necessary).<br><br>Remember - canker sores are Not cold sores!  Cold sores are caused by a variant of the herpes simplex family of viruses, and canker sores currently aren&#39;t fully understood what causes them and why some people get them and others don&#39;t.

A single mother with two children, ages 6 and 8.<br><br><br>I had abnormal Pap smears starting 8 years prior, when I was pregnant with my daughter. I was never told that I had HPV, even though I did. After each abnormal Pap test result, I would have a LEEP and colposcopy.<br><br><br>\u00a0During colposcopy, the doctor uses an instrument to magnify the cervix to see any abnormal cells. Often the doctor takes a small sample of tissue (biopsy) to be checked for cancer and other abnormalities. LEEP\u2014short for loop electrosurgical excision procedure\u2014uses electric current passed through a thin wire loop to remove abnormal tissue.]<br><br><br>And then, I had abnormal bleeding. I thought it was from a poorly placed IUD. I went to my gynecologist, who said, \u201cYou know, you have this history, and you have HPV, and so I\u2019m going to do a Pap, but this time I\u2019ll sample cells a little higher up in your cervix.\u201d<br><br><br>I got abnormal results again and scheduled yet another colposcopy for the day before Thanksgiving. I still really wasn\u2019t concerned. I got the results on December 15th, three days before my school\u2019s winter break. My doctor called while I was teaching and said, \u201cI have your results. You have cancer. I can\u2019t treat you, and I have referred you to an oncologist. They will be calling today. You probably will have to have a hysterectomy.\u201d I left work, and sat in my car, in shock. I sat there for maybe 45 minutes before the tears came. I had no idea what to expect. All I knew was I could not die, I had two babies who needed me.<br><br><br>I was completely taken aback by the news and I knew my survival would be determined on how I choose to go about the situation. I had decided to combat the disease through naturopathy and inwardly, I knew there would be no appointment with no oncologist. I had been triggered for certain reasons to tackle the disease naturally.<br><br><br>\u00a0It was during my endless research for some holistic remedies on the net for my condition - I was opportune to come across the professional herbal works of Dr. Harry Obiego - the African man doctor who had completely reversed this disease naturally. I had seen testimonials attributed to the service of this herbal doctor and his distinguished skills in the world of phytotherapy. The content had it that he was capable of healing HPV and Cervical Cancer via a traditional herbal method, and as such I had been really tempted to give his service a trial. I had nothing to lose, all I had wanted was to be saved from this terrible ordeal, in spite of anything it would cost me, for my little kids. And Providence had led this herbal practitioner into my life to give my health life a different interpretation - In brief, after having tried this natural medication by this herbal doctor I had soon started to experience positive impact in my health. It was too good to be true for I knew I was on the verge of my absolute recovery. After some few weeks of using this natural medication, I had gone for another colposcopy test of which my home doctors had confirmed that they had gotten clear margins and there was no evidence of the disease. In other words, I had been completely freed from the disease.\u00a0 \u00a0<br><br><br>This miraculous change in my health life had occurred few months ago and I am very much as pleased to share this piece of information every moment because it means so much to me as to be healthy again, and I know inwardly, that it would also mean so much to other people who happen to be suffering from this disease and would also prefer a normal life too. I wish to use this message to give confidence to those who would by chance happen to come across this information to be hopeful and find a confidant like Dr. Harry Obiego in overcoming their HPV &amp; Cervical Diseases. You can reach this herbal practitioner today for a healthier condition. I would also encourage this piece of information to be shared among friends and loved ones in order to create a positive awareness.\u00a0<br><br><br><br>You can reach out to this herbal doctor directly via the means below:<br><br><br>Email:\u00a0drharryobego@<a href=\"http://gmail.com/\">gmail.com</a><br><br><br>WhatsApp: +234901 616 1406....", "comment_date": "2021-07-14T08:21:07Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Nolan Knight", "comment_text": "I\u2019m 100% sure I\u2019ve been cursed by the devil", "comment_date": "2021-07-13T23:02:52Z", "likes_count": 2}, {"comment_by": "David 015", "comment_text": "Bit my lip while biting into this juicy Mango last week, it hurts so bad", "comment_date": "2021-07-13T07:13:16Z", "likes_count": 16}, {"comment_by": "danielle", "comment_text": "i can&#39;t even eat without feeling pain \ud83d\ude2d", "comment_date": "2021-07-12T22:48:33Z", "likes_count": 3}, {"comment_by": "lovin kookie.", "comment_text": "does any of y\u2019all get them from biting your lip\u2026? just me \ud83d\udc41\ud83d\udc44\ud83d\udc41", "comment_date": "2021-07-12T22:35:00Z", "likes_count": 2}, {"comment_by": "Shronk", "comment_text": "I have one rn but mines on the inside on the top lip so nothing hurts when I eat and brush my teeth cause nothing can touch it phew", "comment_date": "2021-07-12T05:34:14Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Frans bauer", "comment_text": "DRIHENYENONOJOLU\u00a0the man that always keep his words and promise, i saw post about this man on net, i was like asking myself if this will work, looking at this i give this great man a try, and i was so lucky he cured me too and today i am free from herpes virus, you can also contact him now for your cure, via whatsapp +2348070670235....", "comment_date": "2021-07-11T23:55:05Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Laureen Fiore", "comment_text": "I fully recommend Dr Ogudugu on YouTube for his herbal product that get rid of herpes virus and other diseases", "comment_date": "2021-07-11T17:34:07Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Anchelantchi", "comment_text": "Guuuuys It&#39;s suuuuper painful but If you have a regular one use toothpaste you apply it on the mouth ulcer and it&#39;ll sting like crazy but then you&#39;re going to be at peace for a certain amount of time, repeat when it starts to hurt again!!", "comment_date": "2021-07-11T11:25:58Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Victory Ben", "comment_text": "I was able to get rid of my herpes virus with herbal medication prepared by Dr UGBOKHOLAN  on Youtube am a living testimony", "comment_date": "2021-07-10T21:50:30Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Amelia Jones", "comment_text": "Im alway tempted to try bite it of and feel the pain, the thing is.

Mouthwash kills off most bacteria active in your mouth, and the alum dries out the cleaned sore, allowing it to heal faster. I\u2019ll do it right before bed so I don\u2019t fiddle around with my tongue, and use both for about 2 minutes. Just wet a q tip with some water, dab into the alum, and apply it directly on the spot. After treatment the spot becomes numb, the next day it stops growing and by the day after that the pain already starts reducing.

I\u2019m 38 now and have successfully solved the problem.  I noticed that mine were always directly related to something very acidic. Pineapple, Oranges, Lemons and some sour candy would result in a canker sore a day or two later 100% of the time. By cutting these things out completely, I just don\u2019t get them anymore. The biggest key is, if you take a bite of something really acidic, only have a piece of it, and go brush right away immediately (1-2 min max) after eating it. If you can\u2019t brush, you\u2019ll need to rinse your mouth with cold water thoroughly. I\u2019ve even went as far as to use my finger as a toothbrush with water and rubbed my inside cheeks and gums for about 60 seconds while continuing to flush my mouth with new water.  I haven\u2019t gotten a canker sore in 6+ years. <br><br>If yours is not due to acidic, it\u2019s probably something your mouth can\u2019t handle. Try to trace back your meals. Also, you should be able to prevent them by rinsing or brushing after every time you eat something. Don\u2019t let food particles stay in your mouth when your done eating.

It was bigger than the end of a q-tip. Here&#39;s how I cured it with alum powder. Don&#39;t chew your food (buy a blender) or at least chew with the other side of your mouth. You can&#39;t afford to do anything that might irritate it. Don&#39;t use toothpaste with SLS (sodium lauryl sulfate). Don&#39;t use any mouth wash except very gently swishing with the toothpaste redmond brand earth paste with activated charcoal. And it&#39;s probably a good idea not to even swish with mouthwash over the sore while it&#39;s still trying to heal. Okay so Disinfect it with hydrogen peroxide. After you disinfect it apply a small amount of alum paste that has been mixed with a drop or two of distilled water using a q-tip. This cauterizes the wound so it can seal up and finally start healing. Apply alum a maximum of 3 times a day morning afternoon and before bed. You can spit out the alum after cauterizing the wound for 60-90 seconds. Try and spit out all extra alum powder. Rinse your mouth out with water if you want to, or don&#39;t. At least always remember to spit the alum out. If you want to really dry it out faster then just spit it out and don&#39;t rinse your mouth out with water afterwards but rinsing your mouth out after applying the alum is still a viable option. Once the wound is finally sealed up after a day or 2 or 3 note that applying more alum powder does not produce the burning sensation anymore, that means the wound is sealed up completely and it should start healing on its own without needing more alum but continue doing everything else I mentioned earlier. Once the canker sore is almost gone apply manuka honey on it to complete the healing process. Also, mixing bee propolis powder with water will make a paste that helps to repair and remove dead left over cells and aslo heal potential scar tissue.", "comment_date": "2019-02-24T10:31:58Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "grz", "comment_text": "I get canker sores whenever I accidentally bite the inside of my mouth", "comment_date": "2019-02-24T09:46:10Z", "likes_count": 3521}, {"comment_by": "Laine Lilge", "comment_text": "Hey guys, here are some more tips if you have kanker sores: <br>1.

Unfortunately, I&#39;ve not been able to find this remedy (at least over-the-counter in the UK) for the past few years, so they may have withdrawn it.  Basically, you dipped a cotton swab in some sort of chemical (I think I may have been Silver Nitrate) that you then dabbed onto the sore.  It chemically cauterised the sore in a matter of seconds, forming an instant scab. This scab formed a hard protective shield over the sore, which immediately blocked any further pain.  The scab then came off within the next day or two.  This was a brilliant remedy, in that unlike every other &#39;cure&#39; out there....this didn&#39;t decrease the pain or speed up healing time, but instantly took care of it.  The only negative aspect of this product is that those two or three seconds after you dab the sore when the cauterisation takes place is INCREDIBLY painful...but that is totally worth it knowing that after those intense few seconds of pain....everything is done and over with!!  I wish they still sold this, as no other remedy comes remotely close to its effectiveness!!!  Anyway, if anyone knows or remembers the product I&#39;m referring to, please let me know.

Here&#39;s some good advice from someone that gets really bad canker sores.<br><br>First, I generally get them from some kind of injury. biting my lip/cheek is the usual cause; sometimes food does it, and less frequently sometimes I&#39;m stressed.<br><br>What you need to do when you suspect a canker sore could form, is eliminate any trigger foods in your diet, and toothpaste. For me, that&#39;s anything acidic, anything spicy, any kind of nut (including peanuts/chocolate), and bananas. If I eat any of these things, or use toothpaste, I&#39;ll get a canker sore and it will hang around for a week (often longer). If I don&#39;t do any of these things, I essentially get a baby canker sore that&#39;s generally not painful and heals in 3 days. <br><br>Honestly the most annoying part is skipping toothpaste for a few days, but I make do with baking soda. Also, I&#39;ve found I can drink coffee and it doesn&#39;t make anything worse.<br><br>Finally, I have to state again that if you suspect you may have a canker sore forming, exclude all your triggers from your diet immediately. Once the pain starts, it&#39;ll stay, though you can at least keep it from growing by avoiding your triggers. Every time I bite my lip/cheek I do the above and have been basically canker free for almost 2 years. prior, I&#39;d get them at least every month or two.<br><br>My gf gets them too and doesn&#39;t listen to my advice and it&#39;s always fun to watch her canker sores grow and grow, since the local food is spicy here. However, The few times she&#39;s done what I&#39;ve done she&#39;s had the same results (essentially no canker forms). They seem to be more painful to me than to her, so she deals with it because she hates cooking and hates my cooking. <br><br>Also anything that numbs the area is essentially useless imo. Sometimes it makes things worse because you eat things that make the canker worse, it gets even more swollen, and you bite it again.

At night dry the ulcer and apply the paste (I dab a spot of water on top of paste for comfort). The paste will feel like a tiny spot of annoying dry-mouth but this is why I use at night. If the paste has stayed on most of the night (depending where it is in your mouth) you probably won&#39;t need to use it a second time.
