Why has dinosaur collagen been carbon dated with the same ratio as mammoths? Why has not peer-reviewed papers engaged this question? They don&#39;t want to make anything official in an attempted refutation to what Christian-concerned scientists has had dated. How was it pulled off? Miller had the dinosaur collagen mailed to many universities with the Carbon 14 dating labs without telling them it was from dinosaurs obtained from fossils. No bias from the secular universities could sneak in. Pretty awesome 007 stuff there. When the University of Georgia found out, they were horrified and told Miller they would not do it anymore. The actual letter is pictured as evidence. So again...why no official scientific refutation of Miller&#39;s findings in any peer-reviewed paper? We have evidence from absence here. This infers they cannot do it. The two choices are dam if they do, damn if they don&#39;t. If they did do the Carbon 14 test on dinosaur collagen, they would have to say it came back Carbon 14 dead or say it did come out to be the same as Miller came out to find. If they said if it was Carbon 14 dead, the test would have to duplicated. If they said it did come out to be the same as Miller&#39;s finding, then they would have no explanation of why it was not correct. Why? The AMS Carbon 14 dating is fool-proof by its protocols. It can&#39;t be refuted. It means there has been not enough time for evolution have occurred coming out that the dinosaur samples to be 22,000 to 39,000 RC years old. The years-old is based on gradualism being assumed as being correct, btw. With catastrophism, then the years old would come down to being in the Biblical timeframe. <br><br>So...but you have proof for &#39;evolution&#39; because of the appendix, right?", "comment_date": "2021-07-09T01:46:38Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "ChrisD4335", "comment_text": "Seems like pretty sparse evidence for supporting a different species.", "comment_date": "2021-07-09T00:16:27Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Marty Lawrence", "comment_text": "Neanderthals were human with a 99.84% DNA identical sequence. We are 99.9% identical to each other as humans. When you subtract the thousands of years since we lived together with them, we we would be 99.9% identical to us back then. It&#39;s the principle of mutation load.  Their physical trait differences are caused by gene expression modifications. You know that YOU believe probably and your academic mentors have assumed and taught that a gene expression difference entails DNA mutations getting naturally selected. Go ahead. Confess it. However gene expression modifications by the epigenome and epigenetics is accomplished by chemical tagging ABOVE the DNA with no alterations to the DNA sequences. It works as a software program running atop of the hardware of the DNA. Guess what? In 2014, in peer-review for the first time, it was the epigenetics, the epigenome biological system, gives the transgenerational adaptations and trait passing into the HUNDREDS of generations WITHOUT DNA MUTATIONS getting evolved to do it. The theory of evolution since its &#39;new synthesis&#39; progressed by DNA mutations getting naturally selected into these new adaptations...such as the Darwin Finch with its different beaks to different diets. ToE has said after changes to environment, diet, or threat it was evolution&#39;s after-the-fact DNA mutations. The epigenome supplying the adaptation ABILITY before the environment, diet, or threat changes fits the intelligent design signature. These smart-designed epigenetic adaptations goes with the cavefish, the lizards who have their gut elongated to a new vegetative diet from insects, some of the cases of bacterial antibiotic resistance, or country sparrows becoming urban ones in their adaptations. No evolution is involved. Neanderthals were not &#39;cousins&#39; of us. <br><br>The &#39;Dragon Man&#39; would be another species with no evolution-pertinence.

By studying the DNA of modern and prehistoric populations, it was determined that one of the unknown species inhabited northern Asia, while the other inhabited eastern and southern Asia. Almost at the same time the first Denisov&#39;s bones were discovered on Russian territory. One more species from East and South Asia remained to be discovered. Now we finally have a complete set of our family.
