Maybe.  But my Cat bathes herself when she is laughing.  One day the dog, on a leash, lifted his leg to pee, she ran under him, causing him to fall over.  She ran to a spot just outside of leash range and took her bath.  Then ran under him again when he tried to pee, again falling over.  She took a bath.  Then as he tried a third time, she ran at him again, the dog, thinking he could out smart the cat, tried to catch the cat by scrunching down.  Didn&#39;t work because she jumped over him.  Took  a bath.  Another time she hid some of the dogs toys on top of the refrigerator and dropped them behind him, one by one.  Being a dog,  he couldn&#39;t figure out where they were coming from, and after each drop, she took a bath.  Many other instances of the cat pranking the dog, always took a bath laughing at him.  So I think the Scientists have it wrong, cats are just amused by us, and that is the real reason they stick around, for the laughter.", "comment_date": "2021-09-22T01:52:23Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Karen L", "comment_text": "WHY WOULDN&#39;T THEY COMPARE HUMAN TEST DATA WITH CATS!?!<br><br>If YOU saw a box-shape on the ground, YOU&#39;D STAND OR SIT IN IT, AS WELL!!!<br><br>Also, EVERYONE is tempted to play in a box that looks like it&#39;s large enough to fit inside!", "comment_date": "2021-09-22T01:51:47Z", "likes_count": 4}, {"comment_by": "Mike Manning", "comment_text": "Can scientists tell me why my cats like sitting on plastic textures like plastic bags, rain coats, and lunchboxes", "comment_date": "2021-09-22T01:50:28Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "RustyTube", "comment_text": "By Kanisza did you mean Kanizsa, in which the zs is pronounced like the English zh?
