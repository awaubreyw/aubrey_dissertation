Simple<br><br>Wash your hands often, disinfect your phones often too. Masks are effective in some manner if you suck at covering your mouth when you cough. If you are sick at all, wear a mask to protect those around you. But you should know that standard procedure masks will not do much to prevent you from getting any virus. The CDC recommends hand washing as the  best thing you can do. Viruses are very small and will go through every opening around the sides of the mask. If wearing a mask makes you feel better then sure, but you should leave them for the patients who are sick and for health care workers who are exposed on a daily basis. <br><br>Main take home message... If you have known contact with a COVID-19 confirmed or SUSPECTED patient, you should stay home and self quarantine for 14 days. Call the department of health for your state and explain your situation. DO NOT GO TO THE DOCTORS (YOU&#39;LL JUST SPREAD IT... THAT IS NOT QUARANTINE) . DO NOT GO TO THE ER UNLESS YOU ARE EXPERIENCING LIFE THREATHENING SYMPTOMS.<br><br>If your oxygen is below 95%, take some deep breaths if you can to see if it improves. If your oxygen is below 90%... GO TO THE ER. If you dont have a pulse ox, evaulaute yourself. Are you are truly having actual difficulty breathing?...GO TO THE ER. That doesn&#39;t mean your nose is stuffy and you cannot breath through your nose.<br><br> Take over the counter medications. Tylenol (acetaminophen) and ibuprofen to control fever and some associated aches and pains. Take mucinex DM and decongestant meds for congestion, coughing, and drainage. Take care of yourself. Try to go to sleep for at least 8-10 hours a night. Rest and do not infect others. <br><br>Quarantine means stay out of the public and stay indoors away from other non infected ppl. 80-85% of people who will get COVID-19 will recover without any issues. If you are 65 yrs old or older then you are at a higher risk. If you have comorbidities then you are at a higher risk. If you are 80 yrs old and above then you are at a much higher risk. Couple this with asthma, COPD, CHF, Sarcoidosis, Diabetes, and/or cancer, then you may want to actually worry about COVID-19. This means stay indoors.  Especially if you are within these age ranges and with these health conditions. Don&#39;t be stupid and most importantly, don&#39;t be blinded by fear.<br><br> Fear is the death of logic.

They were normal citizens, city dwellers just like the rest of us, they were parents, students, employees, travellers, people who go on and out to perform daily tasks every day. As the epicentre they have done EVERYTHING to try to minimise the spread, most people who lost their lives were innocent, and there is absolutely no reason to hate on them. And for the rest of China, practically every part of their economy is placed on hold, every part of their lives from schooling to making a living is jeopardised, the level of inconvenience Chinese people are facing is beyond what the rest of the world who are inconsiderate and self-centred can imagine.

I understand what SciShow is saying with the definition of a pandemic is true, but that is happening with coronavirus where it migrated from China (because of people traveling to and from China) and took hold in other parts of the world (Like Europe, Asia, and some parts of Africa). There are enough infected people in these new epicenters (Like Italy, and South Korea) that the virus can make its own &quot;colonies&quot; in these nations and can easily spread to new neighboring nations. Plus all the reports on how many cases of coronavirus there are false. China is hiding the reports to not scare investors away as other nations, like the ones in the EU, are also hiding the numbers or showing less of it to also not have an economic downturn like China is experiencing now.  Fortunately in the Western world, we have free speech and non-heavy censorship so the common folk can broadcast the truth on coronavirus in parts of Italy and other infected places. Unfortunately, this disease will spread like the Spanish Flu and properly infect more people than the Spanish flu did, but hopefully with less death because the death rate of the coronavirus is only 1-3%. Yet, with more people infected more chances for the virus to mutate to be more lethal, which can raise the death rate up to 10% or more. For now people should stock up on some resever food, water, and medication even if the virus did not hit your area so you do not have to go out in the choas for food and supplies when the virus does hit your place. Wash your hands frequently, do not touch your mouth or face without washing your hands. And stay away from people for a bit.
