It is one of the safest drugs known. It is on the WHO\u2019s list of essential medicines, has been given 3.7 billion times around the globe, and won the Nobel prize for its global and historic impacts in eradicating endemic parasitic infections in many parts of the world. Our medical discovery of a rapidly growing published medical evidence base demonstrating its unique and highly potent ability to inhibit SARS-CoV-2 replication and to suppress inflammation, prompted our team to use ivermectin for prevention and treatment in all stages of COVID-19.

Please feel free to share and use if you wish. <br><br>5th March 2021<br><br>Dear Dr.  <br><br>I am writing to you regarding the COVID-19 vaccination programme which your surgery has contacted me about.<br><br>Thank you very much for your concern and care.  As an intelligent and discerning individual, I am able to access the scientific literature, via PubMed and other reputable sources, and have done my own studies of the various SARS-CoV-2 vaccines in order to make an independent and properly informed decision.<br><br>Having reviewed the available evidence in depth, I have made the informed choice not to accept your offer of a SARS-CoV-2 vaccination.  While I know it is my right to decline any medical treatment offered to me without explanation, I will happily outline my reasons here in writing for the record.<br><br>In the first instance, this vaccine has already been reported on many occasions around the world to have caused actual bodily harm and even death in a small overall percentage of recipients, something which must not sit well with those promoting it after having taken the Hippocratic oath.  These risks of harm are confirmed on the UK Government&#39;s website, where they state that a structured compensation programme has been organised for those left severely damaged by COVID-19 vaccinations.  <br><br>Secondly, the actual evidence of a need for the inoculation of the entire general population against SARS-CoV-2 appears to be very weak.  Studies of this virus, and its predecessor SARS-CoV-1, strongly suggest that people who have recovered from a natural coronavirus infection have a more robust and resilient natural immune protection against the disease than those who take the vaccine.   This, in combination with the knowledge that SARS-CoV-2 infection is mild for most healthy people, does not usually require hospital treatment, and the overwhelming majority of people go on to make a full recovery with no lasting negative effects, naturally leads one to question why you are promoting a vaccine to people without knowing if they have already had exposure to the virus and developed natural immunity? <br><br>Finally, eminent authorities in vaccine science, have issued earnest warnings about the dangers of vaccine development for coronaviruses in particular.  Attempts to develop coronavirus vaccines in the past, have resulted in test subjects developing a well documented condition called Antibody Dependent Enhancement (ADE), also known as pathogenic priming, whereby, when a recipient comes into contact with the wild virus against which they have been inoculated, they are at significant risk of developing a more severe illness than those who did not receive an inoculation.  This occurs due to the paradoxical development of disease enhancing binding-antibodies, rather than disease-mitigating neutralizing-antibodies.  I\u2019m curious to know why you are not properly informing the public of the risks of ADE/pathogenic priming, a concern which was published in the medical literature during the trials - &quot;Informed consent disclosure to vaccine trial subjects of risk of COVID-19 vaccines worsening clinical disease&quot; - <a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33113270/\">https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33113270/</a>  <br> <br>In conclusion, I reiterate that I do not wish to receive a SARS-CoV-2/COVID-19 vaccination for the above reasons, nor do I wish to be the recipient of any further promotional communication from you about this.  However, I would be interested to hear your response to the above questions.  I shall add references to the base of this correspondence for your attention.<br><br>Thank you very much.<br> <br>Yours sincerely,<br> <br> <br><br> <br>References \u2013<br><br>&quot;Vaccine-induced enhancement of viral infections&quot; - <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7131326/\">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7131326/</a><br><br>&quot;Immunization with SARS coronavirus vaccines leads to pulmonary immunopathology on challenge with the SARS virus&quot; - <a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22536382/\">https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22536382/</a><br><br> &quot;Pathogenic priming likely contributes to serious and critical illness and mortality in COVID-19 via autoimmunity&quot; - <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7142689/\">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7142689/</a><br><br>&quot;Informed consent disclosure to vaccine trial subjects of risk of COVID-19 vaccines worsening clinical disease&quot; - <a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33113270/\">https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33113270/</a><br><br>(Also available here - <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Mw3KV3sfk4mziPMjX0LKBCFe3wGe7NUB9mHiVoutBYI/edit?usp=sharing\">https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Mw3KV3sfk4mziPMjX0LKBCFe3wGe7NUB9mHiVoutBYI/edit?usp=sharing</a> )", "comment_date": "2021-03-06T07:37:56Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "John C Gibson", "comment_text": "Quite a relief.", "comment_date": "2021-03-06T07:35:44Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Origami and Cats", "comment_text": "Except truly asymptomatic and not just presymptomatic people are much less contagious than presymptomatic and symptomatic.
