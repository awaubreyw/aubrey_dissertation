In studies, Heroin addicts were able to reduce the amount of Heroin they used by 40% per week. It&#39;s funny how police always say &quot;Cannabis is a gateway drug&quot; because they always found it at the houses of drug addicts and yet the reason it was there is that it is a substance that helps them restore some sanity and reduce the addiction. And for the record, the real enemy of Cannabis is Alcohol, Opiates and Big Tobacco - because those substances are among the leading causes of death in a majority of major cities and Cannabis frees people from the addiction to those substances by down-regulating the overly high values associated with consuming those addictive and harmful substances. So actually, I kind of laughed when I read the title because Cannabis has not been recognized as the revolutionary choice for addiction even though there is nothing more effective at treating addiction than Cannabis. And no, Cannabis is not addictive as it&#39;s half-life is upto 59 hours. To put that in Context, Cocaine has a half life of 30 minutes and addiction is determined by how short the half-life is. Alcohol is 2 hours. Digesting food is between ~30 to ~46 hours or so and technically you are more likely to become addicted to digesting food than you are Cannabis - if you want to go down that path of saying Cannabis is biochemically addictive. It can be behaviorally addictive but that is like saying that a diabetic is addicted to insulin because they have to inject it several times a day so they don&#39;t die. Likewise, people with disconnected brain components (Such as Asperger&#39;s, ADHD/ADD and the autism spectrum) will find relief with Cannabis and it&#39;s no coincidence that scientists claim that they believe they can reverse all the negative symptoms of Autism through science based on Cannabis - as it reconnects the parts of the brain that are disconnected. Michio Kaku claims that this is short-circuiting the brain however for these people, a short-circuit is more function-able than a disconnected brain.", "comment_date": "2019-03-27T08:36:14Z", "likes_count": 2}, {"comment_by": "Howard Wiggins", "comment_text": "The treatment for alcohol addiction has been mostly stagnant since the 1930&#39;s.
