Thank you, SciShow! Just out of curiosity, would you want to make a comment to the Flat Earthers? I find it hard to believe that there can be so many people out there who are so stupid. I mean, they have the right to believe in any nonsense they want, but for goodness sake, stop trying to convince anyone else!

Cesium (and other atomic clocks) are gargantuan beasts, and cannot possibly fit in a phone, and if they did, they would have to run continuously to keep the time, and would run the battery down in an instant!  They are in the GPS satellites, so they stay synchronized to one another.  What the phone does is to compare the time ALIGNMENT DIFFERENCE between GPS signals from at least 4 different satellites.  This is used to solve for the time and the position in 3 dimensions.  The only clock needed in the phone is one like used in watches, and can be minutes in error, because the only purpose is to determine which satellites are &quot;up&quot; in view.  And yes, the time shift with altitude must be accounted for, BUT THE PHENOMENON DOES NOT EVEN NEED TO BE KNOWN to make GPS work.  GPS is continuously calibrated by a set of GPS receivers at known locations calculating those locations.  Any time errors (both due to imperfect clocks and the altitude shift) get corrected.

Because even lasers disperse over that distance, and the amount of light bouncing off the small retroreflector is so minute, the test may end up getting only one photon back. The window for that photon to travel to the Moon and back is so small though that we&#39;re able to get the range down to just a few millimeters.
