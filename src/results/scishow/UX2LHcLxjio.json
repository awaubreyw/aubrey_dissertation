At time of writing, I&#39;m about to grow 5 gallons of the stuff in the next couple days. Here&#39;s the update video <a href=\"https://youtu.be/2hf9yN-oBV4\">https://youtu.be/2hf9yN-oBV4</a> <br><br>Couple of things. First the idea we don&#39;t know enough isn&#39;t really accurate and there are growing numbers of groups who&#39;ve succesfully made silk on par with the natural varieties. It&#39;s pretty straight forward &quot;make the proteins longer&quot;. Successful groups add linkers to the ends of the silk genes so that once the individual proteins are produced they stick together in a special way that makes the fibers much longer and stronger. Little bit of protein engineering goes a long way if you&#39;ve got a fiber gene to work with. That said, silk is a weird protein that is very repetitive and who&#39;s gene sequence is GC rich. This makes it hard to isolate from spiders and transfer to a new organism. <br><br>So most people make their own DNA sequences that are easy to synthesize, who&#39;s protein, while having a lot of the same properties can be inferior for a variety of reasons. This is less of a limit of knowledge and more a limit of print capability. We&#39;re limited in the patterns the machine can handle. Our synthesis technology can&#39;t print this gene, so we have to massively simplify it and keep it short and repetitive to save on cost. But also even if you print the gene, super long proteins are hard to grow in ecoli at a scale that&#39;s useful. They literally get filled up like balloons and stop working, but also that repetitive nature drains the cells supplies of alanine and glycine. So yields are awful even if your fiber is amazing. Doesn&#39;t matter if it&#39;s better than the real thing if your organism produces miligrams per gallon of media. Hence the weird organism choices like goats. <br><br>TL:DR use natural silk genes if possible, add linkers to the end, pick a bigger organism than ecoli, then just use special solvents to dissolve and wet spin fibers. Tada you&#39;ve got silk on par with the real thing if you choose all the right things. And there are some pretty decent guidelines on what to pick as lots of people have made silks of all sorts of varieties.<br><br>So it&#39;s not that we don&#39;t know enough per say. It&#39;s more that our technology has some weird and specific limits that makes this a hard problem to physically make happen in a lab.  Even if you design a perfect fiber, actually moving the small volumes of liquid around in the right way and having the reactions and organism work as planned is the limiting agent as sometimes bio just wont play along. The spinnertte thing is largely irrelevant and there&#39;s half a dozen ways that all work just as well. It&#39;s a really weird biochemistry lab problem more than anything.  I obviously had to glaze over some stuff, but that&#39;s the gist. <br><br>For those interested, I&#39;m actually working on producing a yeast that produces spider silk and am documenting and explaining the whole process on my channel. Rather than synthesis I&#39;m attempting to extract the genes from spiders so I can have a more natural fiber with less human/synthesis error in it:<br><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fx8TcGrCOSI\">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fx8TcGrCOSI</a>", "comment_date": "2019-02-05T08:51:43Z", "likes_count": 430}, {"comment_by": "Boundless Bryce", "comment_text": "Utah State University has an entire lab dedicated to using goats with the spider silk gene to manufacture silk... <a href=\"https://www.usu.edu/today/index.cfm?id=57744\">https://www.usu.edu/today/index.cfm?id=57744</a> They are not bankrupt.", "comment_date": "2019-02-05T08:43:21Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Ananya Sahoo", "comment_text": "Zombify spiders to make it for us.
