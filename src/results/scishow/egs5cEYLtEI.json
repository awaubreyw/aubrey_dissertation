Squishy things makes sense, in terms of our primal instincts.

But why then do we ALL like squishy things and not just men? And why do we like soft fluffy things like fur? My guess is that usually fluffy things provide warmth, so our ancestors who were good at finding soft, warm things would better keep the tribe alive by being able to make blankets and clothing.
