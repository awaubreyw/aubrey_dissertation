First of all the traditional financial system based on dollars as the world reserve currency uses vastly more energy and is far more inefficient than Bitcoin. In total, the ENTIRE Bitcoin network uses less energy than all of the washer/driers in all the laundry rooms across the US. The &quot;real secret sauce&quot; of bitcoin is not the blockchain, it is both the fixed supply preventing inflation by maligned individuals and its decentralized network. The reason bitcoin MUST have a proof of work system is because there needs to be a way to ensure that there is value in a bitcoin. Work must be done in order to mine a chunk of gold, that is where its value comes from, along with its chemical irreducibility and the inability to create it without putting in the necessary work/value to obtain it by fiscally mining it. It is the same principal as you going to work every day. That provides value to your employer and is the only reason you get paid. Other consensus methods such as proof of stake don&#39;t adhere to this principal and can allow for the creation of &quot;value&quot; out of nothing. Which is impossible and leads to problems, and is the same reason you don&#39;t get paid to sit at home and do nothing all day. Oh wait the US gov is rather fond of that... Get the picture? Printing money, creating value from nothing is corrosive the health of a society and causes inflation which is a tax that effects the poorest individuals in the country the most.

A bitcoin transfer costs under a dollar, a bank transfer costs 25 dollars, and that&#39;s because the banking network is a lot more expensive. If we were using so much more electricity, it&#39;d be more expensive. Maybe you have a problem with how the energy is produced, but that&#39;s the fault of the energy generators, not the consumers.

This is gonna be long, but it has to be because countering disinformation requires honesty more than brevity.<br><br>All electricity is not created equally.. Even if we ignore the blatant hypocrisy that people aren&#39;t equally upset about gaming as a hobby, or streaming services, etc.. then we shouldn&#39;t care about the electricity use unless it&#39;s actually causing harm in some way. The number of kilowatts, gigawatts, terawatts, etc.. that something uses is just an arbitrary number you should not care about in the slightest unless there is too large of a demand for electricity and its taking too much resources from someone or somewhere else, or the way the electricity is generated is more harmful than other options or it was only developed to serve the mining farms, etc..<br><br>But none of that fear mongering is true. And so it doesn&#39;t matter. Studies like the one you feature here @<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mah81EGjHOU&amp;t=6m36s\">6:36</a> are incredibly flawed in the number of assumptions they make and they also usually have fundamental misunderstandings on how crypto mining works so they VASTLY overestimate the electricity used, then they make bad-faith leaps into how that translates at the power company into more carbon emissions. Therefore the mining problem is exaggerated as more and more articles, influencers, and media talking heads pass this bad data around as gospel and hold it up as proof while failing to take into account several very important factors.<br><br>So here&#39;s the problem with all of that: <br>1) These &quot;single crypto transactions&quot; don&#39;t exist, yet they form the base of the anti-crypto argument. You cannot have a transaction on the network that only moves crypto from one account to another, it doesn&#39;t work like that. They bundle transactions together at a set rate, or epoch, ie a predetermined number of transactions will happen every single day, regardless of how many nft&#39;s, trades, or other data is carried out on the network. So when they say a single transaction uses this much energy, they are really looking at the power to move Millions of dollars around from millions of users in countries all over the world. Then they take this power estimate, and they foolishly multiply it by the total number of transactions that happen in a day, month or year. But again, this is ridiculous, because there are really a ton of transactions that were bundled together and moved all at once. So for example if there were 10 billion trades in one day, it doesn&#39;t actually use any more power than if there were only 100. It&#39;s all happening at a set rate, and if your transaction is at the station in time, it can ride this train with everyone else, but if it misses the train, it waits until the next one. Think of it as if UPS ships a package, you wouldn&#39;t say it costs 10 gallons of gas to move your box from one state to another.. you&#39;d realize that the shipping centers and trucks move a bunch of packages at the same time with yours, and this scale is what makes it profitable to do. Otherwise nobody could pay to next-day mail a package for a single person, because renting a private plane, truck and warehouse would cost thousands of dollars and your coffee maker you just bought on Amazon isn&#39;t worth that much.<br><br>2) Power costs are important to miners bottom line, so they go where power is both plentiful and cheap. Usually this means they are going somewhere like Italy, which has hydroelectric plants that produce more power than the local cities can even use. Most of the extra power would just be completely wasted because its impractical to store it anywhere and too inefficient to move it to further away areas. This is the perfect place for a bitcoin mining farm, because the power is cheap and they have more than enough to go around. The miners often use renewable energy sources like wind, solar and hydro because its cheap and often tied to government-backed projects that end up being underutilized. Sometimes, the miners are even making the investments to add new power production in an areas with very little, and whatever they don&#39;t use goes back to the local community. My point is trying to figure out the carbon emissions is insanely complex for this reason, and usually the people making the case against nfts incorrectly assume that miners are getting all the power from burning fossil fuels which is just demonstrably false. Also, it is far more decentralized than you think, millions of people do mine from their homes with small systems, one or two computers or ASIC devices churning away in their garage so they can make an extra $200/mo or so, its not all industrial corporations. Is the power from all those little guys a lot if you add it all up? Sure, but where&#39;s the problem with that, its not like the extra power from a farm in Wisconsin can make its way across the world anyways. Saying things like &quot;this is as much as power as a small country like Belgium&quot; is meant to catch your attention, but you have to stop and think, why does that even matter if the power they use isn&#39;t actually dirty?<br><br>3) You say that it isn&#39;t comparable to other money systems, but that&#39;s untrue. Yes, if you compare bitcoin to Paypal, its no question that Paypal is more efficient. However, its far less secure, and its not fair to compare those two alone. Bitcoin is a total system, it doesn&#39;t need anything else to function. However Paypal is just riding on several other services, banks, credit card companies, the federal reserve and all the systems that are needed to move dollars around extend pretty far. You have to compare Bitcoin to every single dollar transaction to be fair, every credit card swipe and the servers and tech needed to make that happen. Every armored truck hauling money around the city to and from banks.. all the electricity those buildings use for their day to day operations.. there are even wars fought over some of the oil and agreements to keep the dollar as the worlds reserve currency. If you take it into account just how massive the global operations are for the dollar, it dwarfs crypto and is way less efficient.", "comment_date": "2022-05-06T21:51:25Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "NecronMiner", "comment_text": "You guys should follow this up with how prove of space and time compares like the Chia network.

Anybody can fork Bitcoin and create a POS-Bitcoin, but good luck convincing anyone to trust a hard money that is based on anything other than the universal commodity - energy.<br>2. The energy expenditure is not wasted - it was spent for a non-government money, it is the price paid for privacy and freedom. Nothing is free.<br>3. Bitcoin miners always use the cheapest energy, in many cases renewables, it is one of the best drivers of renewable adoption.<br>4. NFTs don&#39;t need to be on POW chains, and after Eth 2.0 merge this year, they won&#39;t produce any more CO2 than a typical bank transaction. NFTs on Solana or Matic, for example, probably already produce less CO2 than you viewing this video.<br>5. Bitcoin base-layer is not meant for everyday transactions, this was discussed by core BTC community like 12 years ago, for everyday use, you&#39;d use something like lightning network, which produces less CO2 than your bank.

You said that the Bitcoin network uses X amount of energy and Y amount of hardware waste to complete a single transaction. The original blockchain (layer 1) process 4.6 transactions a second. This hasnt been enough for many years so there is something called &#39;layer 2&#39; that is essensially any network that processes Bitcoin transactions and keeps an account of them all. Periodically they will settle these on the main chain (layer 1) in something called finalizing. Therefore while you say a &quot;single transaction&quot; requires X amount of energy, the reality is that that one transaction could be millions of transactions all been finalized at the same time. There is no limit to how many transaction can be finalized in one go so Bitcoin can be and already is much more energy efficent than we&#39;re made to believe in this video. Another minor point is that PoS (proof of stake) is nowhere near as resistant to attacks as PoW (proof of work) and if you&#39;re going to rewrite the way the world-wide financial system operates you better make sure it&#39;s unhackable. i.e Bitcoin&#39;s proof of work blockchain.

Proof of stake reduces (1) and (2) increase (4).", "comment_date": "2022-05-05T13:13:02Z", "likes_count": 7}, {"comment_by": "Zed Plug", "comment_text": "Honestly one of the most informative and coherent videos about crypto I\u2019ve ever seen on the internet.", "comment_date": "2022-05-05T13:04:52Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Ho\u00e0ng Linh", "comment_text": "The imperfect latex alternately shave because crime behaviourally bruise round a difficult zipper. didactic, nauseating observation", "comment_date": "2022-05-05T13:03:31Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Alex Alex", "comment_text": "I totally agree with what you are saying ....The fact is BTC is the future of crypto and the question traders ask themselves now is if it is the right time to invest? before jumping into conclusion I think you should take a look at things first.for the past few days the price of BTC is fluctuating which means the market is currently unstable so you can&#39;t tell if it is going bearish or bullish.while others continue to trade without any fear of making lose,other are being patient. it all depends on the pattern in which you trade and source of the signals.

So then they go out in the back yard and make some mud pies and bake them in a cardboard box with &quot;Oven&quot; scrawled adorably on the side.  And then they present the result to their parents as if it was actual food.  That&#39;s cute in children.  But now we have adults who should know better doing the exact same thing.  They think they have discovered the following truth: &quot;Putting work into something makes it valuable.&quot;  They think that effort or exertion -- IN AND OF ITSELF -- creates value.  They think a mud pie is as valuable as food.  But this is a fundamental error.  Work or effort that leads to a USEFUL RESULT creates value.  You can spend all day pushing against a wall or moving dirt from one side of a yard to another and wind up exhausted but create nothing of value, and nobody in their right mind will pay you for it.  Work, to create value, must be USEFUL to someone.  Crypto is adults making mud pies and expecting them to be treated as if they were food.

Bitcoin mining is thought to incentivise the push for renewable energy as mining (when there is excess energy) can actually make renewable energy more profitable. So bitcoin mining could greatly push the adoption of renewable energy. Mining using coal and other non-renewable energy sources is hardly profitable anymore (and will become way less profitable in future).<br><br>2) The statements of &quot;Solve useless math problems&quot; and that the energy &quot;could be used for something else&quot; really depends on if you see value in bitcoin or not. It is money which is not controlled by a single entity, it gives each individual full power over her/his money, you cannot censor bitcoin etc. In short: it democratizes money. <br><br>Bitcoin has a hard limit of 21 million btc. In reality, bitcoin is slightly deflationary. Now compare this to our current inflationary monetary system - individuals and companies are incentivised to spend and take up cheap loans which is not sustainable and very detrimental to our environment. If the world would adopt a bitcoin standard (being deflationary), people/companies would save their money as it does not loose value over time. You&#39;d think twice of buying that shiny new phone each year if you know that if you save the money, it will gain in value over time. This would have MASSIVE benefits for our environment long term.<br><br>Once you understand how revolutionary bitcoin really is for humanity, I fully believe that the energy expenditure is totally worth it for society.<br><br>3) PoW vs PoS: PoW works on the most basic physics of energy and time. Energy and time cannot be manipulated by anyone and there is no way that a single entity can manipulate bitcoin ledger. In PoS, a single entity can quietly buy up more and more until they can launch a 51% attack. This may be unlikely, but why take the risk?<br><br>4) I don&#39;t think you should be citing the central bank of the netherlands as they are naturally biased against bitcoin.

If the same amount of silicon is devoted to crypto as it is now it&#39;ll scale to 10-15 million transactions per day, and that&#39;s being generous. Double it, 20-30 million per day. Quadruple it, 40-60 million per day. It&#39;s nowhere near the billion transactions needed to take over from regular banks. The amount of GPUs needed to reach that billion mark becomes truly absurd, and that&#39;s with future tech. Which is in itself ignoring another problem. Does cyrpto even scale to that many transactions per day? Sure, if we&#39;re talking spherical cows in vacuums it probably does, but in the real world? Can the ledger system take that many transactions without losing it&#39;s sanity? A billion transactions per day is the realm of purpose built SQL databases, which turn off all error checks and instead make sure the incoming data being fed into it is squeaky clean. So it&#39;s not exactly a stupid question. How far can a crypto ledger scale in number of transactions before it breaks? And the answer is, noone&#39;s tested it. Noone knows. There&#39;s a trillion dollars in crypto and the ledger system has never had a real world test to destruction.

Whether it&#39;s investment in renewables, utilization of existing renewables to their full potential, or the creation of technologies that leverage the power of renewables - crypto farms are constantly on the hunt for ways to source new power for very cheap.  Sources that consume resources to heave carbon into our atmosphere are not competitive on this front - so slapping mining farms on the wrist for driving power demand is a bit like-- what&#39;s the saying -- cutting off one&#39;s nose to spite one&#39;s face? You either want renewables or you don&#39;t - assuming you do - don&#39;t shoot the driving forces that bring those renewables into existence.\r<br>2) Mining efforts consume power where there are power islands (cheap, often renewable sources of energy that are difficult to transport to where it could be put on a grid.)  This activity, because mining competition is a global marketplace, drives competitors to either &quot;hang up&quot; their mining rigs or move their farms to find similarly cheap/infinite power.  A couple cool examples here:  Some of the largest bitcoin mining farms in north america are in Canada utilizing hydroelectric power that is 100% renewable, and in texas - where both solar energy buildouts and gas flaring capture technologies are being built to power mining farms and drive down carbon emissions at oil mining facilities by utilizing their unspent fuel that is otherwise a pollutant.\r<br>3) You say that energy consumption &quot;Gets Worse&quot; as cryptocurrencies become more popular.  Why are you operating on the assumption that energy consumption is fundamentally a &quot;bad&quot; thing that gets &quot;worse&quot; instead of a &quot;good&quot; thing that is getting &quot;better&quot;?  This is an error in logic.  Primarily because you are failing to differentiate the counterfactual world in which cryptocurrency mining does not exist and the world in which we live - where crypto mining is driving more and more power production.  The &quot;carbon per energy&quot; statistic you cite is for units of energy that exist before a world in which crypto mining is consuming meaningful amounts of global power - but as previously stated here - units of additional power generation that are brought online by mining activity are inherently cheap and largely renewable units of power - and thus the statistics you&#39;re employing are not apples-to-apples comparisons.  One simply cannot run a bitcoin farm at high $ per kWh areas of the globe where highly polluting power sources are used vigorously to keep up with energy demand - it&#39;s not profitable and one would  go bankrupt trying to mine crypto in this way.  This is not the only reason that you have made a logical error here in presuming that more energy consumption = bad, though, another is:\r<br>4) The way mining farms operate raises the &quot;floor&quot; of energy consumption on power grids, and will always be available to consume the demanded power.   Modern energy grids have pollution problems that are associated with PEAK energy demands.  This means, when the grid&#39;s demand for power is expected to be high, dirtier and dirtier sources of energy are brought online to supply that power.  Not only is having a strong base of always-on demand a driving force for the growth and development of more sustainable energy, but it offers an option to grid operators that did not previously exist.  It is more profitable, cheaper, faster, and better for the environment for a grid to contract with a large mining facility to pay them to turn off their miners (and thus free up power) during peak demands and shortages, than it is to bring - for example - a coal power plant online to provide that same power to the grid.  This option has never existed before-  our best solution previously has been implementing things like rolling brownouts or burning coal and sacrificing our environment to satisfy the grid.\r<br>5) NFTs are themselves not stored on block chains.  Blockchains contain pointers to where NFTs are actually stored - the entry itself is a very small JSON text entry.  You do a reasonable job in this video of avoiding some of the pitfalls associated with recognizing the usefulness of NFT technology - but in and of itself it is not driving any further destruction of the environment than any other type of registration of ownership.\r<br>6) lastly, as you briefly mention around 7 minutes in your video - the emerging technology is a replacement for existing physical technologies.  I would say it&#39;s not a stretch to claim that the HOLLIS library at Harvard consumes way less of our environment than the public library system in Boston --  one involves cutting down trees, driving products all around the globe in cars and trucks, moving people around a city to consume those goods, and physical objects that require swaths of infrastructure to manage and maintain.  Not only this, but anyone can use HOLLIS - you don&#39;t have to live in Boston - and it&#39;s clearly a superior way of accessing the same information.  So should we shun all libraries because they are not as efficient as their online counterparts? Obviously no, but I think the comparison is apt in terms of letting markets tell us how useful emerging technologies are before we grab our pitchforks and decide they&#39;re evil or - to use your words - &quot;a disaster.&quot;\r<br>\r<br>Stay awesome friends.", "comment_date": "2022-05-04T23:46:09Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Patrick Thomsen Mantzouridis", "comment_text": "Without even watching it, <br>A GPU that mines doesn&#39;t stressed more than when it is gaming - it doesn&#39;t consume more energy than gaming.<br>Now, when you are mining, you are spending energy to create wealth, while when you are gaming, you are wasting energy literally just for the fun. <br>On the other hand, do you know any way to create wealth without spending energy? <br>How much energy to you spend everyday/what is your environmental footprint?

But Proof of Stake literally just takes the blockchain and puts it in the control of the chain&#39;s wealthiest individuals.

We&#39;re already at a point where just through sheer brute force, huge organizations are able to control massive percentages of the computing power of the blockchain. What happens when they switch to this system and now only a relative handful of computers need to coordinate in order to falsify transactions? Especially when those computers are owned by people who are already rich and have all the incentive to keep getting richer. I mean hell this probably won&#39;t stop people from having massive warehouses of computers, because now they&#39;ll just run them in parallel so that they can essentially buy more lottery tickets and try to have more computers verifying the transactions.
