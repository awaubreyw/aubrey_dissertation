Unfortunately, the exposition on how the t distribution arise from small sample is at least a little bit misleading.<br><br>To be clear, if you take many small samples (say samples of 5) from a normally distributed population (which is a formal requirement for using t distribution), calculate the sample mean for each, and plot the resulting histogram, you WILL GET A NORMAL DISTRIBUTION. In modern times this can be quite readily verified by running some simulation in your favorite statistical program.<br><br>The issue of this normal distribution is that you CANNOT MAKE any MEANINGFUL INFERENCE based on it, if you have only a SINGLE small sample. The reason is that any meaningful inference (e.g., the probability that the true mean is off from the sample mean by such and such value) based on this distribution depends on the TRUE standard deviation (or equivalently the variance) of the population, which you have no access to.<br><br>So instead you APPROXIMATE the true standard deviation by the SAMPLE STANDARD DEVIATION. This approximation, and the uncertainty it introduces, is the sole reasoning you get the t distribution. More mathematically, while (sample mean - true mean) is normally distributed, (sample mean - true mean) / (sample standard deviation) is t distributed. The upside, however, is that this t distribution does not depend on the true standard deviation and thus can be used to make inference, e.g., of the type mentioned above.", "comment_date": "2021-06-16T13:35:21Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Vu Truong", "comment_text": "I have actually used t-distribution in a software project for a water quality lab for small sampling.

I had high hopes this would be a better way to tell the story of Gosset and the t-test. Unfortunately, the description of the issues with small samples was terribly incorrect. The issues described by the presenter are about how the sample is collected, how representative the sample is of the population. But, that&#39;s not the problem Gosset was trying to solve. Gosset was trying to solve the problem of not having knowledge of the variability of the population (of sugars in beers, or whatever else might be measured) either because it is impossible to actually know, or too difficult to get, a proper census of the population. Gosset&#39;s big insight was that the small samples themselves provided a rough estimate of the variability that existed in the population. But, given the sample was small, these estimates would vary a good bit, too. Therefore, Gosset developed a way to take into account the uncertainty that came from using small sample&#39;s variance (&amp; standard deviation) to estimate population&#39;s variance (&amp; standard deviation). That is what lead to the definition of the t-distribution and the t-test (which was the same as the long-known z-test substituting the estimate of standard deviation for the presumably known standard deviation of the population). In essence, to be confident of a difference we are observing between two means can be trusted to tell us something about the population we need to see a bigger difference in comparison to the observed variation compared to the degree of difference we might see for a z-test.", "comment_date": "2021-06-14T22:41:15Z", "likes_count": 50}, {"comment_by": "Ted Phillips", "comment_text": "Have you done a segment on how LaPlace calculated the population of <br>France, a military secret, for Napoleon?
