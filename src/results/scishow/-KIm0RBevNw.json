You have to remember that even a small tsunami, say 5 meters high, can affect LAND that is 40+ meters above sea level. All of that mass moving in one direction, the water just keeps on flowing against gravity.* And the impact of topography also matters a great deal...a &quot;small&quot; tsunami, funneled into a narrow fjord or bay, will reach great heights as its energy is directed predominantly in the inland direction (parallel to the length of the fjord/bay).

So you don&#39;t actually have 100 meter or 300 meter heights (as measured from crest of one wave to trough of following wave) but rather you have a volume and force (the amount of energy generated by the sudden displacement of a certain volume of water) of water that is capable of washing up to that height on land, like water spilling out of tub. <br><br>Observe the next time you go to a beach and you build a sand castle 10 feet above the waterline as the tide is coming in. A one foot wave with enough force and volume behind it will wash further than 10 feet in elevation and wipe out your two foot high sand castle.
