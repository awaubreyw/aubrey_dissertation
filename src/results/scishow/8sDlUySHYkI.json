It is a neutrino observatory down at the South Pole. The sensing element part of the observatory is roughly a cubic kilometer sized 3D array of detectors deep within the ice (the bottom is about 2.5km below the surface and the top is about 1.5km below the surface). The detectors are looking for Cherenkov Radiation of muons flying through the deep, dark, clear ice. These muons are the result of neutrinos hitting atomic nuclei. So, by one definition, the observatory is 1 cubic kilometer (plus the cabling up the top 1.5km of ice and to the server farm &quot;counting house&quot; on the surface in the middle of the array. But, because the neutrinos of interest are very high energy neutrinos, they are looking for neutrinos coming up through the array. Using the entire Earth as a passive filter to filter out the unwanted (lower energy neutrinos) that are generated by the sun, cosmic rays hitting the atmosphere, background radiation, etc. So if you consider even passive filters as part of your observatory, the size of IceCube is the size of the Earth.
