He used to chase it around and push it . One time, I had to travel for a week or so, and left him in the care of my friend. I took water bottle caps and put rations of frozen bloodworms in them, so I would be sure that my friend doesn&#39;t over/under feed him. When feeding time came, she would let the cap float in the tank, so the food defrostes and then she simply dumped the contents in. He quickly learned that a floating cap means mealtime and soon enough started hanging out around the floating cap containing the food, as to be around when food came. She said that he was less responsive when she fed from a red cap (not the one that was already in his tank), almost ignoring it until he would see worms in the water. Does that mean that he distinguishes colors, since he had a red cap as a toy in his tank, so a new red one was thought of as a toy too?<br>He also learned that my finger in his tank means food. I taught him that since he&#39;s in a 55 gallon alone, and it was hard for me to attract his attention to one spot and make him come to the surface.<br>Another thing, if I do a thorough cleaning of his tank, including vacuming the gravel, he will immediately check every crook and piece in his tank. He would swim close to bottom, slightly tilted down, stop and examine every piece of gravel, turning his head around and looking at it from different angles.

Swapping colored bowls and turning on lights to indicate food cues probably works better with fish because they are so focused on food. A dog can always beat me at a smell test, and a parrot can mimic voices better than I, but they aren&#39;t smarter. They are simply well evolved to do what they need to do to survive. For example, in the wild, fish need to know where food is more likely to be found depending on the time of day, so they are hyper-attuned to that aspect of their environment. Any angler can tell you that. The coy in the pool are just using that same instinct in an artificial setting. They aren&#39;t displaying intelligence in the classical human sense. In fact, most animals can be taught to expect food at certain times of the day, even invertebrates. A clam can do that. A lot of this is just biologically automatic and doesn&#39;t require much &quot;thought&quot;. As well as the claim that fish can &quot;count&quot;...they are schooling animals. Since schooling is something they are bread to do, they can probably automatically look at a blob of dots and tell which is larger, but they aren&#39;t thinking &quot;6 is more than 2!&quot;.
