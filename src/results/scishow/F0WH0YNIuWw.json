Its not great. They suffered among the rich and famous but only in that they did not get the money or credit. It is very difficult and pointless realy but i feel it should be done to extract information about that time to find out who got treated worse. Its seems pretty obviously though every one got it bad in the low classes. And as you look at mid tier families the gap between men and women widen and at their peak the gap is so large in the higjer classes they can be equals in the field to men but be no more then assistants. We tend to look at and concentrate on high profile cases. All i ask is people keep there fields of data collection wide. One doesnt just look at women rights violations to determine if one side is treated better then the other. You look at both thats what it meams to be a researcher. You seek the truth and only the truth. Equivalently the men had it better in a very general sense but women werent digging underground for coal because there lack of strength saved them from that fate. Because of that lack of strength they were given horrible easy tasks, boring tasks. Tasks that took immense concentration for very little pay off. Lace was very expensive back in the day but takes a long time to make. They werent given any bonuses for the gender they were born with but there female limitations were a boon. Not in the case of the radium girls. Fine motor control was not ideal if it meant you were the best for the job of using radioactive paints. So realy women saved themselves. Or there biology did. And we did nothing. However like the women mens biology put them in the postion to lord over women. Now thats all in the past mostly. Enough that the gap is nothing compared to then so can we all agree that we fked up but we have tried so bloody hard to fix what some old twat did for thousands of years since humans first eveolved. Because thats certainly how far back this would go. Its what made us human. Now we have gone against all natural order to make it fair. Pls be happy with that. We all need to understand how massive this is. We owned the entire world and we stood at the top uncontested. Women didnt take that away from us. They wouldnt be able to. WE GAVE IT AWAY. WHAT YOU WANTED SO DESPERATELY WE GAVE IT TO YOU WILLINGLY.  So sit down and carry on with life happy with your equality like the rest of us. Dont take any more. We dont have anything left.", "comment_date": "2022-02-23T03:28:07Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Kristoffer Victor Lorico", "comment_text": "What if there were no discrimation against women and people of color.
