You get infected or vacinated. In each case you can still breathe in the virus.<br>The virus can still settle in the lungs, throat. It can still infect a cell and that cell will still produce new<br>Sars-Cov-2 (SC2) cells. Only when the newly SC2 cells breach the blood, and enter there,<br>does nay immune reaction happen, which is quickly depending on the level of infection before<br>and the time since then, or the time from vaccination.<br>If the time has passed for the body to cease antibody production, the body will once again have to<br>start producing antibodies against the virus and fight off the infection.<br>But...<br>When you have damage still from the last infection, your chances are higher to develop COVID as a result<br>of the infection. An SC2 infection and developing COVID are not the same.<br>You can get infected without getting COVID as well, but for prior infectees, this chance is higher<br>dependant on the amount of leftover damage from the last infection.<br>If this is relatively high, so is the chance for developing COVID, which for serious cass from infection<br>now could very well be life threatening.<br>Since we see people getting reinfected moe and more, as in getting SC2 infected twice,<br>the chances for COVID development also rises, let alone for the people who get SC2 infected 3 or more times.<br>The global community of scientists must by now realize this, if they&#39;re worth their salt.<br>There is NO herd immunity in a herd of our current size and interconnectivity.<br>All you get is everyone keeping the SC2 cycles going.<br>If you look at worldometer, and check the active cases, which is the basis for all new cases,<br>you&#39;ll see that those number vary, but never truly go down. In fact, they&#39;re going up.<br>So, yes, the vaccine is good, because it prevents deaths on a massive scale, but it won&#39;t<br>make SC2 go out of style, and disappear, which means it would stay given current measures <br>Now, for the new variants, these will be able to infect people more pervasively than the ones<br>that came before because the immune system is only keyed (or even overkeyed) to the non-variant.<br>The cases of black fungus are on the rise, since any infection will aid already present infectants,<br>being fought off less and since SC2 requires a lot of immune resources they can rise as well.<br>And like said, we&#39;re talking getting infected twice, not three times or when &#39;coexistence with SC2&quot;<br>starts kicking in, which may then involve getting SC2 yearly, which in turn means dozens<br>of times over the course of a lifetime. Each time, either the damage done by the virus<br>needs to be reduced to zero, or the COVID will become stronger, and then need that much more time<br>to fully heal 100% and when you are infected a couple dozen times over a lifetime, where the<br>damage was not zeroed, it is cumulative, with cumulative COVID.<br>There is NO living with SC2, it&#39;s just as much myth as herd immunity.<br>Also, the best protection for now is vaccination with 5% shots every 2 months, to keep a small<br>amount of the mmune system producing a small amount of antibodies, with updated vaccines.<br>The current vaccination strategy is woefully shortsighted, and is also being set as standard by<br>woefully inadequate scientists whom for the most part are picked by nepotism, political or<br>otherwise lacking standards. We need SKILL, not speech.<br>After the SC2 is over, if it does, we can go back to the usual bla bla, but we need SKILL now.<br>Also, the high number of SC2 incubators must come down, because they are breeding grounds<br>for new variants, and god forbid, more lethal and capable strains.<br>We need no Omega versions for SC2 to become much more lethal, for before any such arises,<br>we may well face concurrent significant biological different infections with SC2, where<br>antibodies with one strain do not offer enough immunity against the other version.<br>This can only be prevented by elimination of SC2.<br>It&#39;s possible that we can stretch the time until it does, by lowering the number of active patients,<br>but that&#39;s about all we can do, without truly getting rid of SC2.<br>the more incubators, the faster the mutation rate, no if or buts.", "comment_date": "2021-11-19T09:42:55Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "David Portwood", "comment_text": "I have heard about this &quot;33 year old man&quot; who was supposedly reinfected with covid.

This is precisely why in the vast majority of the infections the symptoms are very weak or completely benign. (MPIE) mass population immunization by exposure (herd immunity) is the only way this type of virus outbreak ever comes to an end, through virulence dilution by infection saturation throughout the healthy population. This is nothing new however and is precisely how all past corona outbreaks have ever ended.<br><br>        History dictates that a vaccine will not be effective for SARS-COV-2, as they have never been effective for any Cor/viruses, (and very poor flu virus response also) due to the rapid antigenic shift (mutating) properties of the spike or surface proteins within the viral RNA polymerase caused by the hijacked malfunctioning Ribosome&#39;s, replication transcription system inside the cells nucleus. By the time a vaccine is developed and tested the viral RNA genomic blueprint will have altered enough to make the vaccines effectiveness nullified and useless and round it goes with microbiologists/chemists, always playing a dog chasing its tail catch up game with a perpetually error prone and weakening virus. <br><br>       The risk and damage with SARS-COV-2 by all the scientific evidence, data and math is several magnitudes less than what is being discussed by the scientific community. At the end of Dr. David Katz podcast he cites in detail the most comprehensive detailed scientifically data based summery to date, with sources and hyperlinks to the references of all the actual data and numerical statistical math, verifying this immunological and mathematical fact and reality, that the damage from SARS-COV-2 is massively less than previously understood and currently being reported.<br><br>      It is long overdue for the world leaders to acknowledge this, instead of the constant round and round cycle, from a small community of career infectious disease experts, politicians and the media trying desperately to remain relevant and prove to the world that they were right!    <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q6LB2Rp44zA\">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q6LB2Rp44zA</a>          <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=urCPH8W2M4Y\">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=urCPH8W2M4Y</a>                             <a href=\"http://globalnews.ca/news/7085775/coronavirus-vaccine-false-hope/\">globalnews.ca/news/7085775/coronavirus-vaccine-false-hope/</a>", "comment_date": "2020-09-22T02:20:11Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "icy pearl", "comment_text": "<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-JcoFa5ieyA&amp;t=4m06s\">4:06</a>.

Due to the small amount of actual new cases these 2 cases are most likely not a new virus but a flare up of the original infection as there has not been any other new cases reported for a while and at least one of the individuals was a child and kept isolated at home. The other individual had been cleared and returned to work but no new cases have been detected since they retested so luckily nobody else has been exposed.

Wouldn&#39;t that also mean the lockdown would kill MORE people, because the virus won&#39;t go away until enough people get it all at once, because people can get it more than once, so only by ensuring everybody has it at once can you ensure, when they recover or die, it will mean no one has it? Or we&#39;re screwed no matter what, and this could end up becoming a endemic, like a deadlier, more infectious flu? Because you can&#39;t take medicine once you already have it, because we don&#39;t have medicine for viruses, unlike antibiotics for bacterial infections. It would be bad if it reinfects and more deadly each time, it would slowly kill a lot of people over time, depending on how often it reinfects the same host. It is more contagious than other diseases that infect you multiple times, not combatted by simple antibiotics like bacterial infections, and although it&#39;s not that deadly, it&#39;s still deadlier than the flu, and it IS extremely deadly in people over 60 and immunocompromised people.
