Buy a tongue scraper (the metal ones are the best)<br>2. Get a curved syringe (like the ones they give you after you get wisdom teeth removed) squirt water directly at your tonsils after you eat to prevent them building up. <br>3. I know ppl suggest a water pik but unless it\u2019s at a very low setting, it can actually cause your tonsils to bleed. The syringe is better. <br>4. Saltwater rinse. I find listerine didn\u2019t help at all. The salt water gets rid of bacteria and also soothes throat. <br>5. Drink water! I know this is obvious but when you\u2019re eating, drink water to make sure you\u2019re flushing all your food down and reduce chances of food sitting on your tongue. <br>I haven\u2019t got any in almost 3 weeks since I started doing this.

I started to notice that people were beginning to stand quite far away from me when I spoke, before I met Dr Eddymon. I am from los angeles California, united state of  America. Herpes is a viral infection caused by the Herpes simplex virus, marked by painful, watery blisters in the skin or mucous membrane or on the genitals.  This was what I suffered for four years.  I have visited CVS Pharmacy in CA for treatment but no improvement. I met Dr Eddymon online while I was searching for a herpes cure.  I read a testimony about his work. I gave him a try and it turns to a testimony in my life.  Just after two days (2) taking the medicine as directed by him i began to see some good change , my breath was noticeably fresher and cleaner \u2013 and more importantly, me hsv1/2 is gone. My report came out negative, all thanks to God. my \u201cDragon Breath\u201d hasn\u2019t returned since...

I thought it was an ulcer forming but it wasn&#39;t painful.  On day 2, I decided to check it out and voila! There was a white- yellowish patch which I figured out was a tonsil stone.  I tried to take it out with my finger but only a small portion came out. When I got home, I tried to poke again but it just bled.  Any 1.5 weeks later, I woke up with that irritating feeling in my throat again.  Sure enough, it was my tonsil stone poking out. I got my pimple remover and use the circle tip and poked inside the tonsil stone area.  I managed to scoop a few bits. It looked like I&#39;ve taken everything but the OCD in me made me poke more.  And alas! More came out. One big poke and grunt later, a big tonsil stone that size of a small mung bean came out. What was left is a reddish hole with no white edge around it. I knew it was all gone. The tonsil stone didn&#39;t smell as bad as I imagined it to be.  It was smelly but more like when you&#39;ve forgotten to brush after 12 hours. The consistency is more like those nuts that get stuck in between your teeth.  You can crush the tonsil stone with your fingers. And so with that, I brushed, flossed and gargled with Listerine to cleanse my throat and disinfect the area. Thanks for reading my tonsil stone testimony. \ud83d\ude02", "comment_date": "2019-11-12T21:50:49Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Moka_ dotz", "comment_text": "Jokes on you I don\u2019t have any tonsils anymore :,)", "comment_date": "2019-11-12T01:21:15Z", "likes_count": 2}, {"comment_by": "Scarlett", "comment_text": "Ok so when I still have them on my tonsils, they make my breath smell omg?", "comment_date": "2019-11-10T20:19:18Z", "likes_count": 4}, {"comment_by": "A M", "comment_text": "I\u2019m glad I\u2019m not the only person who inspects and sniffs them \ud83d\ude05", "comment_date": "2019-11-10T14:04:37Z", "likes_count": 535}, {"comment_by": "Former Things", "comment_text": "Stainless steel tongue scrape all the way at the back of the tongue and gargle with 50/50 water and peroxide.", "comment_date": "2019-11-10T01:07:28Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Aser Dada", "comment_text": "There are a few components to curing tonsil stones.

Nasty little buggers, you can help them get out by using the opposite end of the toothbrush and press the nearby tissues. This can pop them out a bit while you dislodge them with a q-tip  or finger.  Gargling with salt water afterwards if there is irritation or tiny amount of bleeding.  Avoid mucus provoking things like smoking/vaping, cows milk and other dairy products may be a culprit. Try a week or 2 off of cheese and milk, yogurts and such...it might prove the mucus is from that.  Also heavy consumption of fried foods can contribute. White coating on the tounge is common in American diet, heavy on fat, dairy ect. Try vegetarian eating for a while also. Lay off butter, cream, milk and cheese and too much burger, fries and pizza. Sounds lame but it works on that tounge coating.<br>Gargling with Listerine might be good too.

As integral parts of the immune system, these structures protect the respiratory and gastrointestinal tracts by attacking any viruses, bacteria, and debris that enter the mouth. Your primary tonsils (the palatine tonsils) are located at the back of the throat, on the left and ride sides respectively. The adenoids (the pharyngeal tonsils) are near the nasal cavity, and the lingual tonsils are at the back of the throat. These structures can develop complications like tonsil stones.<br><br>Many people undergo treatments for issues related to tonsil stones, as these lymphatic organs sometimes act as more of a liability to your health than an asset. When infection occurs, the tonsils can create significant health problems such as airway obstruction and greater susceptibility to repeated infections. Each tonsil is composed of an intricate network of crypts that contain cells that fight infection. If a foreign substance like a virus or a bacterium infects these crypts, the tonsils can trap the debris. Once the debris is trapped, it can combine with mucous from the throat or postnasal area and become concentrated into tonsil stones.<br><br>Tonsil stones, also known as tonsilloliths, are the result of the trapped debris that has hardened inside crypts in the tonsils. These stones can be smelly and look like small, white chunks. They may sometimes become loosened and coughed up into the mouth. Individuals who suffer from chronic inflammation in their tonsils or repeated tonsillitis are the most at risk for experiencing tonsil stones, since frequent infections can cause the tonsils to become swollen, red, and inflamed continuously.<br><br><br>If you are experiencing symptoms such as a sore throat, bad breath, or breathing issues, see your doctor or an ear, nose, and throat specialist. He or she can examine your head, neck, and mouth to determine the cause of your symptoms. If he or she observes that your tonsils are enlarged and have white, hardened stones, your healthcare provider may recommend the surgical removal of the stones. In some cases, the tonsils themselves may need to be removed to prevent frequent infections and stone-formation. <br><br><br><br>We made a video on how to easily get rid of tonsil stones permanently in less than 3 days.

First off, let me start out by saying I&#39;ve been dealing with tonsil stones for many years, since I was a child. I know how annoying they can be, having that feeling of something in the back of your throat. And sometimes you just cant get them out. Luckily I have a rather simple, yet effective solution. The thing about this video I don&#39;t agree with is that he says removing your tonsils is for severe or extreme cases. Trust me when I say this, get your tonsils removed. It is so worth it. Just make sure you tell your doctor how annoying it is to have, and ask for an ENT to see if you can get those taken out. Once they are out, Im not going to lie, it is going to be a very VERY hard 10 day recovery if you are an adult. The healing process is pretty painful, but please dont let that scare you off. After those 10 days, you will never have to deal with tonsil stones again. I did it, and I&#39;m a wuss when it comes to pain. I know you can do it too.
