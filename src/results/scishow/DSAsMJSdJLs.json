Especially the electron beams he&#39;s talking about. A material can be radioactive only if it naturally has an unstable core or by making the core unstable only through neutron radiation who changes the composition of the core, making it unstable.

With the new ring, it had many more diamonds in it and we asked that maybe some peridot&#39;s could be placed in it as we had been married in the month of August. He said that wouldn&#39;t be a good idea since the peridot is brittle and over time it would chip or scratch. He took out a green Sharpe and colored every other diamond to show what it would look like if it had green diamonds put in instead of the peridots.
