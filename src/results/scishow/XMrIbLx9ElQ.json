First, there are indeed places on Mauna Kea that are sacred. These are places where Hawaiians have continuously participated in traditional and customary practices; so there are unquestionably specific geo-cultural sites on Mauna Kea that are protected, and the practices that are associated with these sites meet all the defining criteria of being traditional and customary.<br><br><br><br><br>But the extension of sacredness to the entire mountain and the air column above it gives rise to questions about how much cultural validation there is for the idea that this pre-empts any and all other uses of the mountain.<br><br><br><br><br>I found no documentation indicating that Mauna Kea, as a whole, is sacred. I could not find any reference to any blanket of sacredness over the entire mountain and the air column in any of the usual sources of validation \u2014 not even in the Kumulipo Hawaiian creation-origin chant, or in the writings of Native Hawaiian historians of the 19th century like Samuel Kamakau, David Malo, John Papa \u2018I\u2018i and Kepelino.<br><br><br><br><br>Beyond the blanket-of-sacredness claim, there is nothing else on record to suggest any validated sacred places would be disturbed by the construction or operation of the TMT.<br><br><br><br><br>Validated sacred places include the peaks of Pu\u2018u o K\u016bkahau\u2018ula, Pu\u2018u Poli\u2018ahu and Pu\u2018u Lilinoe, Lake Waiau, and various heiau (temples), \u2018ahu (altars), ana (caves), lua k\u0101 ko\u2018i (quarries), and ilina (burials).<br><br><br><br><br>In fact, I believe the decision about the TMT\u2019s location was made to ensure that no sacred site was violated, nor access to any sacred site impeded. The telescope was also sited below the summit to minimize its visual obtrusiveness.<br><br><br><br><br>...<br>\u201cThe TMT presents probably the greatest opportunity \u2013 the greatest cultural opportunity, religious opportunity \u2013 that we will ever have to do the one thing that is at the center of every cultural group.

I\u2019m assuming that at some point in time, with projects like the TMT, we will actually be able to go back and find the Night of P\u014d.

The issues would be obvious, for instance, for logging or suburbs development. Though even if the environmental impact is small, the cultural impact is a shame and I would have to side with the indigenous people. I&#39;m not religious at all, but I&#39;m not for defacing extremely important religious places. As for Spain being able to carry out what they intend the telescope to do: why wouldn&#39;t you want the telescope to be better even if it can still carry out its duty in a degraded state?

Can you identify even one chief or priest who was or is buried in the Mauna Kea\u00a0summit (&quot;MKS&quot;)\u00a0area used for telescopes? I doubt you can. Prior to the European-style Hawaiian monarchy, Hawaiians went to great lengths to bury chiefs&#39; bones\u00a0secretly in places\u00a0where the burial\u00a0would\u00a0hopefully\u00a0never be subsequently discovered. The MKS\u00a0 area is not such a place. And it has never been known as a &quot;key&quot;, &quot;chief&quot;, or &quot;main&quot; place for Hawaiian cultural practices.\u00a0Only protestors\u00a0claim that, based on their own politically motivated faux-native practices. If the MKS area\u00a0was busy with cultural practices, then it would obviously be an extremely poor choice for\u00a0secret burials. The MKS\u00a0is about 13,796 feet above sea level. That&#39;s plenty more than double the elevation of Denver CO (more than 2 miles high, closer to 3 miles high).\u00a0The MKS often gets snow\u00a0during winter. Hawaiians did not have shoes, let alone winter jackets. There is no source of food up there, nor firewood. There is some evidence that &quot;pre-western&quot; Hawaiians did go up there. But the MKS environment was not\u00a0hospitable to extended habitation by\u00a0pre-western Hawaiians. Mauna Kea\u00a0was already there for millions of years before any Hawaiian existed, and before anyone called it &quot;Mauna Kea&quot;. It never did,\u00a0does not, and never will, need to be cared for by Hawaiians, nor by anyone. It&#39;s a\u00a0volcanic mountain.\u00a0Also, the false charges that the US overthrew the Hawaiian government, etc.,\u00a0were debunked over 100 years ago. Note that US President Cleveland, a personal friend of former queen Liliuokalani, tried to restore her to the throne, but failed in his attempt to do so.

However, I feel like we cannot simply put the pursuit of knowledge over the actual lives of people. It&#39;s like Hank said, if this was being built on the site of the Sistine Chapel, there&#39;s no way it would be built. The global backlash, not just from Catholics but from people of all cultures who appreciate the sites historical significance, would be unbelievable. I&#39;m sure that many of people would be fine, because they don&#39;t see the value in religion/culture, but It is central to the human experience and we cannot discount that. <br><br>If this were being built at Mecca, or the Notre Dame, or the Vatican, there would be an uproar of incredible proportions, but its not. We in the scientific community, and specifically those of us from the &quot;Western World&quot; are often guilty of dismissing the culture and religion of the various people we&#39;ve colonized as superstition or mythology, rather than the very real beliefs of living culture; whether we do this knowingly or not. The fact of it is, Hawaiian culture and beliefs is every bit as real and valid as Catholicism/Christianity/Islam/Judaism/ect. and deserves to be respected in the same way.<br><br>There are a lot different fields of science are permanently tainted by their racist beginnings, and who&#39;s modern start is rooted in violent colonization, and many fields which, to this day, have yet to properly rectify the harm they&#39;ve done. If astronomers decide to build the TMT on Mauna Kea, disregarding the native Hawaiian wishes for the use of their land which was forcefully taken, then this field will be permanently cast in the shadow of an era of unbridled racism and colonialism that caused serious harm not just to the native Hawaiians but to many indigenous people across the globe. The research that is produced by this telescope will always be tarnished by the way it was obtained. The TMT will be a monument to astronomy&#39;s callous disregard of culture and humanity in the face of more knowledge, and it will be looked back on with regret and disappointment. <br><br>There are other locations that will work really well for the telescope, and maybe they wont be 100% as good, but losing a few points of clarity is not worth hurting so many people in such a bad way. Technology is always improving, and I have no doubt that in time, we will make advancements in telescopes that would outstrip the observational capabilities of the TMT without having to desecrate a sacred site.

Those with the power, and the industrialists who profit from the derived technologies, have a bad habit of riding roughshod over any concern or resistance, regardless of cultural context. If this practice comes to be seen as the norm in the broader culture, respect for and trust in science, technology, and ultimately the rational thought that produces it, will be undermined.

Most of whom were not ethnic Hawaiians (most though had married into Hawaiian families and quite a few were descendants of both European and Hawaiian parents). At that point in time, ethnic Hawaiian population was at 25,000-30,000 people. The rest of the people of the Hawaiian Kingdom were of American, European, and Asian descent.

It has a strong propaganda component and it dominates the University of Hawaii system. There isn&#39;t one aspect of public life in Hawaii, and especially in the university system that isn&#39;t subject to, and the subject of, Hawaiian Spiritual oversight and practice. All students in public schools, from pre school to graduate school are forced to participate in Hawaiian cultural/spiritual practices. The separation of the church and state in Hawaii is a joke. The sovereignty movement is an effort to create an apartheid regime based on ethnicity, wherein that ethnic minority takes a permanent position of moral superiority and gets to dictate to the majority ever aspect of their lives.

Hank&#39;s description of the perfect location for a telescope got me wondering if the US has or is looking to build one on the MOON. Based off my minimal research, I think China already has some equipment up there. What do you guys (people here in the comments or you folks at SciShow) think about this proposal to build a telescope on the MOON?
