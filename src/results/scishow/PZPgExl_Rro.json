Here is a scientific hypothesis for you to ponder seriously, regardless of how small the relative number of injuries and deaths from the technology if there is any level of genetic contribution to the victim&#39;s vulnerability (and there is for all medical conditions) then what we actually have is governments knowingly committing a form of genocide. A decent and humane scientist would acknowledge this and then do everything to create a diagnostic procedure to identify those at greatest risk so that they could be protected.
