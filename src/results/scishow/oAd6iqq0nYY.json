Also, because you&#39;re paying for it, you shop around.  You compare prices -- and those prices are CLEARLY stated up-front!  You get reviews from other patients.  The doctors who perform these surgeries <b>know all of this,</b> and they therefore do their <b>best</b> to give you the best possible experience for the least possible cost.<br><br>The entire concept of a 3rd-party-payer for medical procedures is something we need to end.  Like LASIK, if we made doctors and hospitals compete for your business, prices would go down, and quality would go up.  That&#39;s what <b>ALWAYS</b> happens when businesses compete.  But for some reason, the vast majority of people are convinced that such competition won&#39;t work in the healthcare industry.

But, like your homeowner&#39;s insurance doesn&#39;t cover the replacement of a worn-out roof or a broken A/C compressor, and your car insurance doesn&#39;t cover things like new tires or oil changes, neither should your health insurance cover anything other than hugely catastrophic incidents.  Everything else should be paid for out of your pocket, and the prices for all of those services should be clearly listed up front and/or negotiated by you and your doctor.<br><br>LASIK is proof positive that such a system <b>will</b> work.
