In the next day or two, 13 of the 17 people were infected with a norovirus.  The only ones not affected were my immediate family and the infant.  The people sitting at the big table (sitting across from each other) were all affected, but my family was sitting off to the side.  My niece&#39;s kids were the first to get sick, and their parents, then everyone else got sick with exactly the same symptoms (diarrhea and vomiting).  My daughter went home with my mother for the night and then called me frantically the next day saying my mom was really sick and could I come and take care of her (my daughter is a high functioning autistic and this was outside her ability to cope).  Fortunately, everyone recovered, but it was amazing how fast it spread and how many got it.  But it seems the virus didn&#39;t travel that far.  That is the only way I can think how the 4 of us escaped unscathed.  I am really glad the baby didn&#39;t get sick.  It was also interesting that once the symptoms developed, people didn&#39;t seem to be contagious - as the baby didn&#39;t get sick even going home with 4 people who got sick.

It happened while I was heading home in a snowstorm and it\u2019s enough to make a man cry.  I had to be hospitalized or I would\u2019ve died from dehydration. I can\u2019t recall how many times I threw up and had diarrhea on the side of the road while shivering in below freezing temperatures. I actually lost a few pounds after my illness.<br><br>The foods I ate at my grandparents before this, I still get nauseous trying to eat them since my body associates them with the virus. I never wanna experience that ever again.<br>-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br>EDIT: I did not think I would get this much feedback, so I&#39;ll go into the full story. This was December 1st of 2019 in the middle of winter. I was with my family in New York, and we live about eight to nine hours away in Ohio.<br><br>I was fine this morning, had breakfast, and even took a nap while my father drove. The first signs something were bad was when I had to take a stop at a restaurant place still very in the morning to take a massive dump. After that, a few hours went by with nothing special.<br><br>Sometime at eight or nine in the morning, we had to stop at a gas station since I was feeling nauseous. I thought it was because of car sickness at the time, so I just bought some nausea medicine and decided to drive some.<br><br>At around ten, a huge storm came in with below freezing rain, causing the road to become slippery. We were on backroads at the time atop hilly area, so I eventually stopped to let my father drive in case something bad happened.<br><br>During the time my father drove, my condition gradually deteriorated. I thought it was because of the hilly roads, but I grew increasingly nauseous to the point of severe anxiety. By the time we finally escaped the backroads and reached a highway, my eyes were bloodshot and I was using all my willpower to not throw up.<br><br><br>I stopped at a pharmacy and they took my blood pressure, which was insanely high. I was on a medicine which raised blood pressure, but not this high. I think it was like 155/85 if my memory is correct. I thought this was because of stress and that everything would improve since we&#39;re on straight roads.<br><br>The situation rapidly deteriorated after this point. Snow and freezing temperatures slowed down highway traffic. I remained nauseous and ended up crapping myself on the road, creating a mess. I had to stop at a gas station with more diarrhea, and ended up throwing up for the first time.<br><br>After that, I began a consistent cycle of having to stop on the side of the highway, having liquid black diarrhea and vomit every ten minutes or so. My hands were turning purple and I was shivering constantly from the temperatures. All attempts to drink liquid were fruitless.<br><br>My mental state deteriorated after so many cycles of this, to the point I was on the verge of crying for mercy. I  would rather bang my head against the wall at this point. My diarrhea&#39;s got even worse, to the point I was literally spraying huge amounts every stop. I tried ginger ale and liquids but this did not stop it.<br><br>My family decided to go to a nearby hospital. On the way I ended up spraying diarrhea onto the side of someone&#39;s house in a neighborhood since I could not hold it in. My face was full of pins and needles, and my jaw muscles were locking up at this point. When I got to the hospital, they put me in a wheelchair and hooked me up to IV. I was so dehydrated that I fell into a drunk-like state for quite a while. After that, I developed a fever and chills.<br><br>After the incident, I figured out that I got the virus because I had attended a festival the night prior and not my grandparent&#39;s foods. Regardless, I still get nauseous whenever I eat some foods my grandparents made the night before. Yeah, I never wanna go through that ever again.", "comment_date": "2020-10-09T21:26:28Z", "likes_count": 330}, {"comment_by": "Randall Kelley", "comment_text": "What would we do if bugs and viruses were as big as us.
