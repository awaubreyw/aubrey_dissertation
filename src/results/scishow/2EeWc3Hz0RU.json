What counts is who counts the votes.\r<br>\r<br>VOTE blue in all you do!\r<br><br>This can never happen again!<br>\r<br>According to Michigan election officials, the 70,000 ballots were counted in down-ballot voting, but it could not be determined whom those 70,000 voters had selected for president. So the votes were tossed out. Had Clinton received those 70,000 votes, she would have won the state of Michigan hands down. When the recount was ordered shut-down, those (probably largely black) votes were, metaphorically speaking, flushed down the toilet and there is no longer a legal means to have them reviewed by human eyes and counted by hand. Without recounts in other states, we have no way of knowing if other large urban areas, where black people tend to reside, had a big pool of votes discarded because the voting machine allegedly could not determine who the voter intended to select. This blatant disenfranchisement of Black voters in Detroit follows a recent erosion of protections under the 1965 Voting Rights Act by the Supreme Court. In Shelby County, Alabama v.  Eric Holder(2013), the Supreme Court destroyed section 5 of the Voters Rights Act by disallowing key provisions of the Act as being unconstitutional.  Before Shelby, certain states and local governments had to obtain federal preclearance before implementing any changes to their voting laws or practices. While section 4(b) established a formula that determined which jurisdictions are subjected to preclearance based on their histories of discrimination in voting.\r<br>\r<br><a href=\"http://thehill.com/blogs/pundits-blog/national-party-news/311099-skeptical-70000-black-voters-abstained-from\">http://thehill.com/blogs/pundits-blog/national-party-news/311099-skeptical-70000-black-voters-abstained-from</a>", "comment_date": "2020-11-16T12:18:38Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Wombat.", "comment_text": "Yup , we have known about this in Australia for decades.

From the get go, I wanted to vote for democrats. I was really invested in voting on Biden for president. The rest of the stuff I didn&#39;t know of. There were candidates in small positions with no party. There were also law propositions, which also have no party. I did noticed something wierd in the ballot. There was a section for presidential candidates. It included vie presidents. The first choice was Donald Trump and Mike Pence. Then there were a bunch of minor candidates I have never heard of. I really wanted to vote for Joe Biden and Kamala Harris. However I had to read through the list. I found the their names at the end. I was able to power through that. It is werd that Trump is easier to find on the ballot than Biden. Both are very important and should be at the front. I wonder if the wierd order was an attempt to get more people to vote for Trump. Now I see this video, I think it may have had an effect. Yikes. I hope this is not big enough advantage to determine the winner. I don&#39;t want another four years of Trump.<br><br>I am getting to appreciate the use of parties. There is a convenient shorthand where all of the members of the party have the same general stance on the issues. Democrats for example prefer to have government aid for the poor and to bring equality for minorities. I want more of that, so I am better off voting for Democrats like Biden. Maybe the party shortcuts is some other mind trick in psychology. I know that some people will stubbornly stick to thier party no matter what. I don&#39;t think that is such a good idea. It is good to be more flexible and adaptable. Personally I am more of a leaner to the left side. It is important to reasearch the candidates and propositions before voting. However some citizens are too busy with thier own life to do a ton of reasearch. I don&#39;t work, but I am going through government services. It takes a lot of time to go through appointments and whatnot, and it is stressful. I don&#39;t have the ability to do a ton of reasearch. So I made due. Having parties helps. I did watch the two debates. One has Biden and Trump. Another has Harris and Pence. That is research.
