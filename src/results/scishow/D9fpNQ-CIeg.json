All I really remember is there were a ton of the wee bebes in their birth dish and they were probably about the size of this apostrophe: &#39; and they were white. But kind of translucent. We had magnifiers to make it easier to see them, but I found it much easier to be more accurate with my pipette with just using my unaided eyes. I was one of the lucky ones that could focus my eyes right to see the little buggers without the magnifiers. <br><br>Before I got there they had some from one of the biting populations too.
