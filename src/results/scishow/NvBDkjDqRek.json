Subsequet sperm count went to rural third world areas, to get an better overall overview of spearm count. Males in such environments have lower sperm count. <br>This difference in sperm count has been known for a long time.  It is believed a result of proto humans binding together as tribes with the males competing not by fighting but shooting their sperm one after another into a female.  The male with the most spearm had the best chance of impregnating a female. This competition ended when proto humans evolved into a creature that entered pair bond relationship between one male and one female. Once pair bond became the human norm, sperm competition ended and with it the drive for bigger testicles (Chimpanzees continued on that path and Chimos testicles are twice as large as human have). <br> Thus by switching the pool of males to include males in rural areas would always drop the male sperm counts in humans.  Thus the latter sperm count effort was design to give a better overall overview of human sperm count.

Not that I would hate humans and me myself like this life. But hard fact is that there is too much people to this planet to support. And I have to admit that it&#39;s one factor why I won&#39;t like people tho - everyone has to have kids. It has become ridiculous. We wouldn&#39;t die from extinction even if half of population desided not to have kids. And we could start from not quilting those who deside not to have children. It&#39;s understandable why people loves kids - just do not expect that everyone does. Or start making up excuses behalf of people why they dont want kids. Leta take care of each others and those kids that already exists without parents or home to call their own. Surprisingly everyone who wants kids defend their right to have them, but not support idea to adopt instead of making some (like people eagerly do with pets). Don&#39;t those orphans or kids put to adoption deserve good parents and home?", "comment_date": "2018-12-04T12:07:18Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Je", "comment_text": "Soy", "comment_date": "2018-12-04T12:05:01Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Pyr3x", "comment_text": "I\u2019m perfectly okay with being infernal actually..

I mean there are 8 billion people in the world. Deer and wolf population follow a pattern of population rise and fall, too. Deer overpopulate, wolves increase their numbers. Deer population drops, and wolves decrease their numbers. It&#39;s a kind of feast and famine cycle. Yet it keeps deer in check from over-grazing the foliage as well: it prevents deer from eating every plant in an area so that it is impossible for anything to grow.<br><br>Humans don&#39;t have any natural predators, though  there are many animals who, hand to paw or wing, can win outright in a fight. (I.e. no guns.)<br><br>Researchers back in the 1980&#39;s at the time seemed to me to have started deer population is not dependent on wolf predation activity rising and falling. And there are other factors in their makeup as well.<br><br>One is called Sex Ratio, the ratio of male to female animals. If a species has a Sex Ratio of greater than one, (more males than females) it indicates a prosperous population and a tendency to grow in general. If the Sex Ratio is less than one (more females), more females are born as the population is poor and not thriving. Thus it is necessary to bear more young. Could we be reacting to the high population in this world?", "comment_date": "2018-12-04T06:16:52Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "CelesteofOz", "comment_text": "Interesting that this is assumed to be maladaptive - has anyone looked at the possibility that it&#39;s an adaptive physiological response to increased population density?
