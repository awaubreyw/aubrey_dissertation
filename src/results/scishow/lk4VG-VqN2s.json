TL;DR: music is fun and educational!  Try as many different kinds of music as you&#39;re unfamiliar with.  Go outside your comfort zone.  :-)<br><br>I grew up in the &#39;70&#39;s, surrounded by Country and later, Hip-Hip, neither of which I got into, though I still like individual songs from both groups.  Later Rap got more interesting to me, but I still didn&#39;t truly get into it--again, just a few pieces caught my interest and I still like them.  Early Metal was really popular in my area, too (Black Sabbath, Metallica, etc), and that seemed to be it for musical styles except for some &#39;60&#39;s and &#39;70&#39;s Classic Rock, and a little Top 40.  Really limited.  So, I got tired of most of that pretty quickly, and got into New Wave, Goth/Industrial, Death Metal, Punk, and various types of World Music I found at this one shop I frequented that had an eclectic music-section.  Found all kinds of cool stuff there.<br><br>For an example, give Balinese Gamelan a try--you&#39;ll either love it, or hate it.  It uses odd, trembling tones throughout the style, where instruments are deliberately tuned and played ever-so-slightly out of step with each other to form an overall throbbing sort of effect.  Crazy stuff.  Or Hungarian folk-singing.  Eerie as heck, but gorgeous.  Same with Finnish folk-music.  Some really unexpected tonal-changes that raise the hairs on your arms.  The Finnish stuff will likely be more accessible for Western ears than the Gamelan, since it still uses a standard 8 octave scale and they use instruments we&#39;re more familiar with, like violin and guitar.  They just use it in ways my untrained ear never expects!<br><br>I think a person can have Perfect Pitch and not know what the names of the notes are.  They just can call them maybe &quot;flat&quot; or &quot;sharp&quot;, just based on their effect, but without knowing the conventions in Western music, knowing the names wouldn&#39;t be automatic.  In that sense, if Perfect Pitch only meant you knew what note is what, seemingly flawlessly, then I think it <b>*could*</b> be taught.  But, there&#39;s more to Perfect Pitch than knowing the names of the notes.  I think of Perfect Pitch as being able to accurately <b>*replicate*</b> the notes one hears, not just naming them.<br><br>The names are a system that&#39;s entirely separate from the sounds, and is a Western European fabrication, one that other World systems of music don&#39;t always use, unless they&#39;re trying to transcribe their pieces into Standardized Musical Staff.  That gets to be a lot of frustration--and fun--for ethnic musicians who&#39;s traditional scales use a lot of half-steps, quarter-steps, or are sliding scales that don&#39;t &quot;settle&quot; at all.  I don&#39;t see how having Perfect Pitch means you&#39;ll auto-magically be able to name that note as an &quot;A&quot;, for example, if you&#39;re not <b>*already*</b> familiar with the naming system and how it works.<br><br>I&#39;m not a trained musician, and cannot read musical staff.  I also didn&#39;t know the names of the notes until I took choir in high-school; even then, I didn&#39;t learn to read the staffs because we weren&#39;t actually taught that part.  I learned everything by ear, and our teacher found my voice thin, but trainable, and he liked that I had a both wide range and very good pitch, so he had a habit of assigning me the more complicated parts of the songs we did.  To this day, I despise &quot;The Flowers of Her Face&quot;, a jazz (I think?) piece I had real trouble wrapping my brain around, because of that.  LOL  I don&#39;t believe I have perfect pitch, though it&#39;s really evident to me when a note is &quot;off&quot;.  I was able to name the tones you guys played in the video, but I think only because I&#39;d heard them labeled before.  <br><br>I have synesthesia, where for me, colours have &quot;sounds&quot;, and vice versa.  So, having an interesting variety of music to choose from can be a mental treat for me--I get to watch in my mind&#39;s eye swirls and blobs, flashes and streaks of colour as the music plays.  Having different genre interests helps, too: I need variety, or I&#39;ll get bored easily.  It&#39;s one reason why I grew to dislike most popular stuff on the radio--it got played too often while the music-producers were trying to sell it as the next greatest thing.  Doesn&#39;t stop me from glomming onto a neat piece of so-called &quot;Popular&quot; music, though.  Some recent ones that probably got way too much airplay are &quot;Despocito&quot; and &quot;Shape of You&quot;, but I still like those two because of how different they are from what I associate with &quot;Pop&quot; music.", "comment_date": "2021-10-21T22:13:59Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Sound Wave6", "comment_text": "\ud83d\ude0c\ud83c\udfb6\ud83c\udfb5\ud83c\udfb6\ud83c\udfb5\ud83c\udfb6\ud83c\udfb5\ud83c\udfb5..Dunkin Donuts is having a Grand opening on 63rd and Treett and they just gave us a card for free coffee hot or cold all the way up to November 15th come get some..And they are giving us a chance to win free coffee for a year..Smile Eagles Fans \ud83d\udc9a", "comment_date": "2021-10-15T13:00:42Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "C Weaver", "comment_text": "So earworms are an invasive and parasitic species.", "comment_date": "2021-10-13T15:49:46Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Mike Watn", "comment_text": "Me an two guys finger whistled at the same time.
