Seriously, do you really believe that DNA, the code of life, just formed completely by chance?  A few million base pairs magically linked up in the correct sequence to create and regulate life?  Somehow this unique cell is programmed to reproduce itself, and starts making copies of itself and keeps dividing for the next 4.5 billion years?  During this time, random genetic mutations will make the cell \u201cevolve\u201d into every species of organisms that have ever existed?  That has to be the most preposterous idea I\u2019ve ever heard!  The notion of each Kingdom in Biology \u201cevolving\u201d from a single celled bacteria is beyond fantasy!

Maybe which of the two won out could have come down to mRNA being the least energy-intensive thing to transport across the nuclear membrane, as opposed to DNA ior assembled proteins?  <br><br>The macrovirus hypothesis is presented in this video as an alternative to the inside-out hypothesis, but also suggests a very modest extension of the inside-out hypothesis to explain the same thing.  It might plausibly be that minimising activity which goes on inside the nucleus helps to optimise its function as a safe nonvolatile storage area.  On another hand, perhaps it could be that a macrovirus got blebbed up at some point along with the ancestors of mitochondria, chloroplasts, and such.  <br><br>If our whole Eukaryote lineage might include not only endosymbiosis between multiple prokaryotes, but also virus particles, personally we find that notion rather warm and fuzzy rather than disturbing: an extension of the endosymbiote hypothesis, wherein some of our ancestors tried to eat other ancestors of ours, but instead they survived together and their descendants are different parts of our cells today.  <br><br>Venturing beyond modest speculation and into the very wild, so take with a big grain of salt, perhaps today&#39;s macroviruses might instead be descendants of Eukaryote nuclei: occasionally ribosomes get into the nucleus, and over a lot of die rolls, one led to a replicating nucleus.

The tricky bit is that this can be argued both ways regarding which came first was the original nucleolus a virus or did an original cell go onto found a lineage of viruses?<br><br>Additionally the proteins used to construct the Nucleolus double membrane, endoplasmic reticulum histones, and the cytoskeleton have thus far only been found within the viral group and Eukaryotes. Neither have been found within Prokaryotes in either Archaea or Bacteria thus far only within giant viruses where they play vital roles in high jacking the cells ribosomes and or the packaging of viral material into protein shells. It also should be noted that both bacteria and archaea use circular genomes whereas DNA viruses and eukaryotes use linear genomes which is interesting. <br><br>One thing with some of the giant viruses is that they appear to be able to infect any type of Eukaryotic cell, amoebozoans, ciliates, various algae, fungi if it swallows the virus capsule via phagocytosis it is fair game.  It seems likely this has to do with the viruses not using the transcription machinery of their hosts  due to having their own so they only need the hosts ribosomes to actually translate the contents. That gives an evolutionary advantage for greater autonomy for a virus as if it can infect a wider array of  hosts,   then the more easily it can spread.<br><br>Giant viruses are pretty terrifying in that regard. The other eerie bit is that one of the deadly scourges of humanity thus far the only one ever gotten rid of small box is a member of this viral family like all pox viruses it is a reduced member of the Nucleocytoviricota in terms of the size of its genome.
