I&#39;m sure there are plenty of interesting things that DNA data can help us confirm or disprove, but in general there is a certain obsession of DNA that I really hate, that I think you&#39;re comment feeds into. First of all, as a student of linguistics &amp; anthropology, I know that culture is not found in DNA. The beliefs, practices, daily life, the vast, vast majority of the experience of an ancient Roman, that&#39;s not in their DNA.<br><br>The thing DNA can help us understand is the movement of people groups, and even that is not perfect. For example a lot of people in Hokkaid\u014d Japan, fascinated by the native Ainu culture, wonder what their roots are, where they come from, especially when compared to the &quot;wajin&quot; or majority culture of Japan whose language traces to the Yamato people of Honsh\u016b. Often, I&#39;ve heard people talking about this or that genetic study that says Ainu are related to this or that central Asian group, or to no other modern group, etc, and I kind of hate it. The genetics of the Ainu tell us NOTHING about who they are. Talking about DNA ends up being this racialist mentality where DNA is seen as deterministic of what kind of human, what kind of culture you are. Language and culture can and have throughout history transcended genetics. If one group subsumes another, genetically distinct one, the dominant group&#39;s language &amp; culture will spread into it. Language and cultural complexes can spread just through trade and prestige, all these sorts of things. What the genes of the Ainu tell us about who their ancestors are related to, on it&#39;s own, tell us very little really about the Ainu.<br><br>We know from Archeology &amp; anthropology though, that there were people participating in a form of J\u014dmon culture in prehistoric Hokkaid\u014d, then developed into a distinct cultural complex called the Satsumon culture, while another cultural complex the Okhotsk culture, seems to have come in from outside Hokkaid\u014d (from the north), and brought in many elements we see in the later Ainu culture, such as bear worship. The Ainu are undoubtedly influences by all these stages, but which one brought in their language? We know that the Okhotsk culture had the more visible influence on the Ainu culture, but genetics tell us that Ainu are around 50% derived from the Satsumon culture, and only 22% from the Okhotsk, according to recent study * . This genetic data point is interesting, but it is not the whole story. Okhotsk culture may have had more power and influence and their language became dominant, giving us Ainu, or maybe Ainu was the language of the Satsumon culture, a descendant of some form of J\u014dmon language, and just borrowed a lot from the influential Okhotsk culture. DNA can&#39;t answer these questions, not alone anyway.<br><br>* <a href=\"https://academic.oup.com/gbe/article/13/9/evab192/6355032?login=false\">https://academic.oup.com/gbe/article/13/9/evab192/6355032?login=false</a>", "comment_date": "2022-06-04T03:44:03Z", "likes_count": 5}, {"comment_by": "kubakakauko", "comment_text": "Never google for &quot;Dinosaur with 10milion teeth&quot;", "comment_date": "2022-06-04T03:35:06Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Johnny Repine", "comment_text": "Does the permineralization process not affect the level of zinc in fossilized teeth?", "comment_date": "2022-06-04T02:56:06Z", "likes_count": 6}, {"comment_by": "IT RAINED MARSHMALLOWS YESTERDAY!
