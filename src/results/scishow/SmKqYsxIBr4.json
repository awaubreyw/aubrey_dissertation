The protester are mostly youngster that is easily manipulated. Hong Kong happen to have the most spies agent from the west in the region. The person that got light on fire that Julia talked about is an elder that try to stop the protester from damaging the street so that they can go make a living. Protester are blocking the roads preventing normal commute and some citizen try to help by removing them and got beat up with metal bar. There are many people that didn&#39;t join the protest and just want to continue to make a living got beat up. There&#39;s video of which a truck driver got beat up and his truck burned for going to work. Many video of the police beating up protester are edited. There&#39;s one lately where a protester was throwing bricks on the police and when the police start to move in he would sit on the road and got push on the floor and detained. But the footage that is show on the west is just the part he&#39;s sitting on the road on ward. I&#39;m from a country that have nothing to do with China or the West therefore we see both side of the stories and most of the time we only see the protester beating up citizen breaking public transport and shops. And we all know this is how the American operate. just like in the middle east. stir up conflicts. And i&#39;m totally amuse by how pro western this protester are.
