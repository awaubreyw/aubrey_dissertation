Also they&#39;re a zoo which specialises in breeding endangered species (these are Asian eles), so when it&#39;s the right thing to do, they breed them. (The animal&#39;s health is <b>always</b> priority. In this case it was as much her mental health as physical.)<br><br>So there they were, 22 months on, mum&#39;s got a big belly... Nothing happens. Ok, it can take a month or so longer than 22 months. They kept a v close eye on her, and by 25 months she had started losing weight and scans weren&#39;t showing a baby (they knew it wasn&#39;t a phantom pregnancy from earlier scans). Apparently, when things go wrong, it&#39;s possible for an elephant to absorb much of a dead baby before delivering what&#39;s left. The keepers were devastated and waiting for the horrendous inevitable outcome. <br>They went to work one morning and checked in on the animals before properly starting work (animals first, tea second!) and had the biggest, best shock ever. There were four more legs among the closely gathered forest of elephants than should be there... Straight up to the CCTV, and they got to watch their precious matriarch having her final, <i>live</i> healthy baby!
