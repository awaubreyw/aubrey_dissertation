The grizzlies had been together for most of their lives; they were rescued as cubs from a circus that went under and due to their constant contact with some not so nice &quot;caregivers&quot;, they weren&#39;t suitable for release or for a zoo.  Anyway, the sanctuary owner had never taken in bears before these two, so he had a lot of studying up to do.  Turns out that grizzlies in captivity, most of time, will kill their own young at about a week old, even if they are completely healthy.  In all, Jasmine (the female) had 3 sets of twins during their lifetimes at the sanctuary.  Unfortunately, he was not able to get the first set in time.  The next two took some significant manpower.  Whenever she was in heat, Cody would get extremely defensive.  From what we were told by the local zoo, their captivity enabled them to mate year-round, and the second set of twins were born around the same time she would have been coming out of hibernation, which was pretty late for a grizzly.  He had no idea she was pregnant; she managed to hide herself from the owner from the time they mated in late summer all the way through hibernation (which was a little bit unusual because they never really hibernated since they had no real need to).  He went in their enclosure one morning to feed them (something that had never, ever been an issue.. those bears ADORED him.  He would go in there in the summer and wrestle with Cody without worry) and Cody attacked him.  He BARELY got himself out of there.  He spent 3 weeks in the hospital.  During that time she had her cubs and we were like &quot;OOOHHHH That&#39;s why Cody went crazy&quot;, but since he was in the hospital, we had to get those babies out of there.  Basically, we had to tranquilize both of them in order to remove them safely and start bottle feeding them ourselves.  But since Cody was so angry, tranquilizing him was really difficult.  But we succeeded, and everything was fine after that.  The last set of twins was easy.  I have photos on my computer of my mom and I with the third set of twins being absolutely adorable.  After Cody passed away, Jasmine became very depressed, so we decided that she move to an actual bear refuge run by a friend of his in Montana.  She spent her last days with her now-adolescent twins running around a HUGE reserve with other grizzlies and all was good for the rest of her life.  One of the twins still lives there, running around acting like a typical grizzly bear.  Anyway, just my anecdote to add to the conversation that most bears (except black bears and polar bears) do not take care of their newborns in captivity unless they are in a position where they are able to be more wild and have less contact with humans.", "comment_date": "2020-08-25T20:16:09Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Galaxia7", "comment_text": "Another infamous example is what captivity does to orcas.
