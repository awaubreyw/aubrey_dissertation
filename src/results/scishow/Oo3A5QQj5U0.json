And we beg Russians for 1950s Soyuz to lift our heaviest loads. We use the ancient Mercury and Gemini, why not the newer and best, Apollo F-1 rocket? Why beg the Russians for their stronger rocket than our Gemini Titan? The Apollo F-1 remains the strongest rocket ever! F-1 the only 100% reliable rocket ever! 65 engines, 13 flights, zero F-1 failures! To the moon with five F-1 not 39 raptors, and no risky refueling in orbit! NASA planned the F-1 to take us to Mars by 1985, why didn&#39;t we use it? Why not now? With 39 F-1 we could do far MORE than Musk&#39;s Starship! Why did we waste 15 years waiting for the Shuttle rocket? A weak hydrogen burner needing solid fuel boosters. We could have launched Shuttle on 2 or 3 F-1. Why did we wait 60 years for Musk, Bezos and ULA to replace the Apollo F-1? We centrally use old &#39;60s Mercury, Gemini, we discard America&#39;s best, Apollo and use Russian Soyuz. And old late 60s Shuttle weak hydrogen rocket is now back on the new SLS to take us back to the moon - weak, so with solid fuel boosters. Why not use the tested and proved, 100% reliable F-1 that already took us to the moon? What is the hidden scandal of the F-1 that it&#39;s the only &#39;60s rocket we don&#39;t use? Our strongest, that took humans the farthest. The F-1 was plagued with explosions early on. Oscillations, but engineers found a way to make them &quot;self-correct.&quot; Then F-1 became the most reliable, strongest rocket ever. Is this the scandal Neal Armstrong meant in his moon landing anniversary, last speech: &quot;Things left undone,&quot; &quot;protected by truth&#39;s protective layers.&quot; Maybe the F-1 that powered the moon flights has some hidden scandal. What else could be left undone, protected by truth&#39;s protective layers? Going to the moon/Mars would be more urgent. If people thought no one had been there before. Do we want the real 1st people on the moon to be communist Chinese or invading brutish Russians?

I remember watching as Armstrong became the first human to set foot on our moon--my parents let me stay up late to watch the moon landing lol. That was a wonderful, awesome time. The technicians and designers managed to work miracles, given that JFK wanted us on the moon in 7 years&#39; time. Also, kudos to the ladies who made the calculations that made the moon landings possible. Great work, everyone!! I agree that that era was likely the only time that the moon landings could have happeved. It really was a perfect storm.<br><br>I was watching the series &quot;From the Earth to the Moon&quot; and crying over Apollo One. What an awful way to die. But their deaths made getting to the moon safer due to the lessons learned from the tragedy, I cried, too, watching the recreation of the first moon landing. That really was an incredible era and I&#39;m glad that I was alive at the time. I highly recommend this series about the space race, from the Mercury programme to the final moon landing in 1972. i cannot imagine the sheer courage it took to go into space for the first time, let alone the moon. What struck me was how primitive the computers were, especially when compared to today since even my little laptop is hundreds of times faster and more powerful. However, they were good enough to get the astronauts to the moon and back<br><br>That photograph of the earth was incredible. That small blue world in the vastness of space really brought home how precious it truly is.

The risks were mitigated later on specifically because we learned that X could happen, or when Y happens Z can happen, and then we developed precautions to solve those problems.<br><br>Apollo 1 is a great example.  Before Apollo 1, while we conceptually knew that more oxygen meant more fire risk, we didn&#39;t really have a great concept of how quickly that scales up or how drastically the fire changes.  In Apollo 1, we learned that a pure oxygen atmosphere can combust almost immediately, and that there&#39;s effectively 0 chance to save the crew simply because the extreme heat generated killed them almost instantly.  After that, while NASA still experimented with higher oxygen levels than normal, there was ALWAYS a substantial amount of noble gas like Nitrogen in the air.  I believe a number of their missions ran at 40% oxygen, which is almost twice normal levels, but still represents a drastic cut from 100%.<br><br>In essence, we didn&#39;t really realize that the risk was there, or at least that big, until the worst happened, and then we started mitigating that risk.  The same WILL happen with every new major step in exploration, just like it HAS happened in every past major step in exploration, either physically or technologically.  Open sea exploration saw deaths before we learned more, internal combustion engine technology had deaths before we learned more.  Mars or Moon colonization WILL have deaths before we learn more.

I would like to say that every mention of &#39;space&#39;, &#39;science&#39; and &#39;engineering&#39; in the show could have been substituted by any other endeavour humankind has ever undertaken and been just as meaningful and relevant. At around 27 minutes, Brady Haran talks about what is the point of extending our lives and making them safer and more comfortable, if you don&#39;t do the Apollo type projects. He is right, but I would turn that upside down too. We have longer lives and safer, more comfortable lives because of Apollo type projects. If we didn&#39;t have the leaders, the go getters and risk takers that make these things happen, we would literally still be living in caves fearful of all the dangers in the world that could take us early. For those out there who always pour negativity on achievements like this, perhaps they would think differently if they realised what they wouldn&#39;t have if it never happened. In the case of Apollo, they would certainly not have their PC, mobile phone, GPS navigation. Without material advances, their holiday flights would be more expensive and less safe, their cars would be less efficient and more expensive and so on and so on into areas you wouldn&#39;t believe could have benefitted from or even come about because of Apollo. We are a better society now than we were in the past because of things like Apollo and we will be even better in the future because of things like it. One day there won&#39;t be a disadvantaged person can be pointed at to ague that there &#39;are better things to spend the money on&#39;. And it won&#39;t be because we didn&#39;t do these things, it will be because we did!

I was a child in 1969, and the moon landing is one of my first and very few episodic memories (thanks sci show for the term) of my early days. I can remember sitting with my parents and neighbors, my friends, and we watched the television set for this event. And it sparked in my a curiosity about space, science, physics astronomy , and more that still exists today at 55 years old,  Apollo was that powerful. As kids we watched these launches and landings with such keen interest. It was science at work, no boring classroom exercises. And without Apollo,  we would not have what we have today. It inspired so many great minds to continue the exploration of space and all that such an endeavor entails. <br>In the course of my career I had the opportunity to meet numerous people who were celebrities, or persons that were part of making history,  from Kings and Queens , prime ministers, and on down the line. I very seldom would ask for an autograph or even go out of my way to engage with that person,  but I did so with 3 of the Apollo astronauts,  John Glenn, Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin.  I consider meeting and talking with these 3 explorers as one of the highlights of my life and they are cherished memories.  <br>The Risk was worth the reward. Apollo shaped so much that there is hardly anything we take firxgranted today that wasn&#39;t influenced by those missions.  Fortunately we had people who were willing to take those risks, even though they did not know the outcome and certainly had no idea how far reaching their contributions would take us as a people. While we laugh about the preconceptions people had before science advanced our knowledge on any given subject,  take Columbus, a man much vilified in today&#39;s PC world,  yet imagine the courage it took to set off in a little wooden boat, to sail the opposite direction people usually did, because many still believed the world was flat,  to find a route to the Indies. Essentially that is what the Apollo astronauts did, they climbed into a little metaphorical little wooden boat and went to the moon.

Subjectively determining that the program was worth it because it was hard seems to only really scratch the surface and doesn&#39;t add anything new to the discussion. We already knew it was hard and we already knew it was politically motivated by the Cold War. <br><br>What really would have been interesting is exploring the innovations associated with the Gemini and Apollo programs that have resulted in the betterment of all mankind along with the missed opportunity cost of diverting such a large amount of public resources to one program. As contemporary critics had pointed out, what would those vast public funds have achieved if not invested in the space program? Were we on the verge of scientific breakthroughs that fizzled or were delayed because of a lack of public funding? Could we have improved the socioeconomic status of our citizens reducing poverty and generating long-lasting economic opportunity? These are relevant questions that demonstrate value much more than the subjective conclusion that it was worth it because it was hard. Lots of things are hard that don&#39;t really contribute to making it worth doing. Vietnam was hard, but did that make it a valuable endeavor?<br><br>There is one aspect of SciShow&#39;s analysis that should you should have spent more time on to demonstrate the value of Apollo program: the switch to integrated circuits in the aeronautical guidance systems. Integrated circuits have revolutionized modern human life. Innovations like this that were spurred by the space program objectively demonstrate value. That the motivation and the resources were both available to support innovation and problem-solving gives credence to the argument that the program advanced human progress and therefore worthy of the tremendous cost of the program. I would like to have heard more about lasting innovations that came out of the Apollo program or were inspired by the need to solve the problems associated with space travel, like the ones outlined here: <a href=\"https://www.nasa.gov/sites/default/files/80660main_ApolloFS.pdf\">https://www.nasa.gov/sites/default/files/80660main_ApolloFS.pdf</a>.

The Cold War wasn&#39;t just a staring contest between two great powers, but two ideologies. Both sides told their people that their very way of life was at stake. There will always be people who will take the risk, who want to learn, and who want to explore. But the people with the power, who hold the pursestrings, mostly cared about preserving their own power. The &quot;discovery&quot; of the New World wasn&#39;t because of the inherent need to explore the world. Spain funded the fleet to circumvent the Ottoman Empire&#39;s control of the trade routes to the East. As an Islamic nation, the Ottomans were seen as inherent and ideological opponents to Spain in the hyper-religious world of the 1400s. Unlike Venice, Spain took the risk. Europeans didn&#39;t force their way through the rest of the New World to learn new things, they did so because of the economic benefits. The government focus, obsession, and competitiveness that allowed Apollo to be funded were the same that lead to the Red Scare and the countless dead in the proxy wars of the Cold War.", "comment_date": "2019-07-19T23:52:40Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Michael Vernon", "comment_text": "Not long enough lol", "comment_date": "2019-07-19T22:44:54Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Mike", "comment_text": "If we had invested the money from the apollo missions instead (using a super conservative 1% annual return) we would have 42 trillion.", "comment_date": "2019-07-19T22:34:42Z", "likes_count": 2}, {"comment_by": "Bill Sweeney", "comment_text": "Thanks SciShow; you always deliver the best content :) Kudos everyone that worked on the video.", "comment_date": "2019-07-19T22:08:30Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Emily Janet", "comment_text": "Congrats scishow!

The beginning of the Moon Race was a scary time! People all over the world weren&#39;t scared of communism, they were scared of Soviet expansion by force. War. When Kennedy made that speech Americans were getting killed in the Space Race,  and that meant we were at a disadvantage in war. ( A war in which we&#39;d all die.

That said, one of the things alluded to in this video but not directly addressed was the value of inspiring others. In my case, in 1969 I was a 6 year old boy sitting in front of a black &amp; white TV, watching this all transpire. Fast forward to today - I had a 25 year run in information technology, did everything from computer operations to programmer/analyst, and am starting a second career in healthcare right now. What inspired me to do all this? In no small part...was the Apollo program.

From meeting and listening to the Canadian astronaut Chris Hadfield and from reading his book &quot;An Astronaut&#39;s Guide to Life on Earth&quot; I am convinced of that.

Apollo was perhaps the most important battle of the Cold War and for that reason alone it was worth the money. Many in America at the time had the fear that if the Russians beat us to the Moon it would lead to Russian global domination and ultimately a Russian flag flying over DC. Apollo stopped that (even if it was only a fear). <br><br>However, to succeed and beat the Russians Apollo had to be done the wrong way that led to only short term gains in human space exploration. To win the race to the Moon, Apollo had a blank check book and only a few short years. They were wonderful years of exciting space spectaculars. In fact one Apollo astronaut reflected that &quot;\u00eft was like someone took a decade out of the 21st century and inserted it into the 20th century.&quot; But to win the race the Americans had to adopt a basically socialistic methodology. The Americans made the Apollo program a centralized government led and funded program that brought nearly all the nation&#39;s technical and engineering might to bear on reaching the Moon in a few short years. Aerospace companies were selected and funded to follow NASA&#39;s lead to develop and build the spacecraft that would take Americans to the Moon. By doing this, we were essentially playing by the Russian&#39;s socialist rules (and beating them at it!).<br><br>The incredible irony here is that that is the strongest capitalist system in the world was not using a free market economy or relying on competition, but socialism, to accomplish Apollo&#39;s goal. This led to amazing results and the United States winning the race handily (with special thanks to Russian problems with Soyuz and the N1 rocket). But it also led to the sad downfall of Apollo after winning the race. You see, since Apollo was government funded and directed to accomplish a single goal, there was no  way for human spaceflight to continue without massive government funding and control. That meant that politics would be the controlling factor and when ten percent of the national budget was going to Apollo, once the goal was reached, the funding would disappear, and it did. NASA even had several billion dollar lawn ornaments that would never go to the Moon as a result. <br><br>Because the aerospace industry grew up on government contracts, it never had the pressure of competition to make it efficient and cost-effective. All it wanted was another source of income after Apollo and so continued it&#39;s love-affair with the government and military contracts. In fact, efficiency and cost-effectiveness became the enemy of increased profit for less effort and advances in human spaceflight came to a screeching halt. Instead of going to Mars after Apollo we built a super expensive and unsafe system to go in endless loops around the Earth. This was the mistake of Apollo. When Apollo ended, US human spaceflight ended. The huge investment of Apollo may have won the Cold War, but the cost was not leveraged for the future. Apollo was abandoned because it was designed to really only do one thing, and very expensively.<br><br>What should have been done at the start of Apollo was for the government to offer a series of prize competitions for the first company that could develop the least expensive rocket to lift a sizeable payload to orbit, spacecraft to carry a crew, rocket to carry the spacecraft from Earth orbit to the Moon, and perhaps a spacecraft to land on the Moon and return (if the earlier spacecraft could not), as well as spacesuits, lunar rovers, and lunar bases. The winners of these competitions would be guaranteed a certain number of flights (but not all of them!). This could have produced a healthy launch industry that would have grown to become more robust than Apollo and able to accomplish more at a lower cost. Since it would be commercial, competition would drive each company to improve their product and lower their cost. Some would fail, but others would succeed. This could have led to a lower cost for Apollo and enabled NASA to continue flying Apollo missions, or better yet allowed the launch industry to handle the hardware and have NASA just purchasing the services from the best providers.<br><br>Following a capitalistic model for Apollo might have taken longer but it would have cost the US taxpayer less and resulted in a more diversified launch industry capable of building bases on the Moon and exploring Mars long ago. My guess is that the US would still have beaten the Russians to the Moon AND left us with a viable growing human spaceflight capability for a much lower cost.", "comment_date": "2019-07-18T02:57:53Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "TheyCallMeNewb", "comment_text": "Only Brady Haran could require an etcetera in job description.", "comment_date": "2019-07-18T02:48:00Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Brian McConkey", "comment_text": "Only got 10 minutes in and had to bail, that music is setting a terrible tone for a show with some serious questions to answer.
