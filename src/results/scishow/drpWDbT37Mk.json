What is the flehmen response? Yes, when those animals make those faces, those are flehmen response. But that isn&#39;t just what they are.<br><br>What they are, are complex actions taken without direct intervention by the brain and which <b>must be completed in sequence once they begin</b> and which most importantly are not learned actions. They are built in, through evolution using various reflex responses to craft a choreographed action.<br><br>The reason those vasonasal organs require flehmen responses to function is touched on - they are not a passive sensory organ, it needs to be actively engaged. But the process that allow that engagement are precise and intricate and complex. Little muscles twitching in a very specific order and intensity that once it begins must function to completion.<br><br>Why the pedantry? Why go to such lengths explaining basically exactly what hank did only to say that hank missed the bigger picture? <br><br>Because vasonasal sniffing is not the only flehmen response. It&#39;s not even the most interesting one. The most interesting one i know about is what happens when you try to take an egg out of a swan&#39;s nest. If a swan (it may be limited to certain species of swan) sees an egg outside her nest, the swan will instinctively extend it&#39;s neck, hook it&#39;s beak around the edge of the egg and do a sort of complex wiggle of its head to shimmy the egg back into its nest.<br><br>It looks like a regular action until you do a few more things and observe. First of all, the swan will do this with any rough analog for an egg. Anything small round and whiteish will send the swan into a series of movements which will push the &quot;egg&quot; back into the nest. It&#39;s instinctual. Mother swans don&#39;t need to be taught this trick. They just see an egg and their head moves reflexively.<br><br>The other thing you can do which will show the true nature of the flehmen response is when you take the egg away after you&#39;ve triggered the reflex. The swan will continue to make the complex series of head movements, shimmying a non existent egg up into its nest.<br><br>It can&#39;t stop itself. Once it starts it can&#39;t stop. It doesn&#39;t need to learn what is actually a complex sequence of actions taken in a specific order. And yes the scientist (i think he was named flehmen) discovered these sorts of animal reflexes trying to explain that absolutely ridiculous horse facial expression.", "comment_date": "2018-09-19T08:48:09Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Pasha", "comment_text": "So you&#39;re telling me other mammals have special thinga maging system that makes them better at smelling except for us?!
