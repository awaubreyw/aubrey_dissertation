Growth rate: Rubber trees reach full height in around 13 years, while maples takes between 20 to 30 years. The ideal growth of these hypothetical man-made genus of trees should then take between 12 to 15 years, if one is to use the rubber tree as basis for the breeds.\r<br><br><br>2. Yields: Continuing with the rubber tree example, it is a matter of how soon and for how long can they produce their sap. Tapping (the procedure to extract the sap) for rubber trees begins when they are around 6 years old, and can be tapped for up to approximately 26 years. One tree can produce 19 pounds (roughly 8.5 kg) of rubber annually. Therefore, a viable hyperaccumulator tree intended for metal recovery should aim for a similar range of yields per yer per life cycle.\r<br><br><br>3. Toxicity: Bearing what she mentioned about allelopathy (<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4z-kG9DCzUI&amp;t=2m39s\">2:39</a>), trees that thrive in metal-rich soils can be harmful to other flora and fauna, even if they haven&#39;t specifically evolved to be so TO THEM. While it is true that these trees in THEIR OWN NATIVE ENVIRONMENT are perfectly integrated into the ecosystem, we must not forget the issues caused by other aggressive trees that have inflicted environmental damage when introduced into other ecosystems (the eucalyptus issues, specifically). Trees are natural havens and food supplies for a huge variety of life forms, and the kind of impact that Hyperaccumulator trees can theoretically produce could be massive if done wrong. And this is to say nothing of the potential environmental problems of the sap extraction alone (rubber tapping residues can affect soil and water). This takes us then to\r<br><br><br>4. Infrastructure: Considering all this, specific infrastructure to support both the trees and the surrounding environment is capital. The example of the rubber tree is a good frame of reference, encompassing both the potential environmental hazards and industry-related issues (rubber trees compete with oil palms). Care has to be taken not too create invasive monocultures (like in the case of oil palms); therefore, the hyperaccumulators must have around themselves a proper ecosystem that acts as a buffer between them and the environment. This translates in the actual engineering of the soil itself where they are to be grown, with previous preparation to avoid including components that could kill the hyperaccumulators themselves, or the other plants/animals that share their environment (hypothetically, a nickel tree may not survive if their soil has other trace metals it cannot handle). Traditional plantation approach therefore, is not a viable approach, regardless of higher short-term yields. New method are required to make it both ecologically and economically viable. However, even if those issues are tackled, there remains a rather large and potentially game changing issue that needs to be considered, namely\r<br><br><br>5. Large-scale, long-term impact: As the palm oil industry so glaringly demonstrates, large scale commercial agriculture RESHAPES BOTH THE ENVIRONMENT AND THE SOCIETIES AROUND THEM. The first effect, the environment impact does not only include short-term environmental destruction and purging of other lifeforms (which in themselves are long-term, butterfly effects); they contribute to the birth of unexpected plagues, ranging from flora, fauna, fungi, insects, bacteria, and maybe even viruses (who know? Maybe the Virus-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named came from that source) as nature struggles to fix itself, eventually pushing evolution in directions we cannot fathom (ok, I got a bit overboard there, but still, food for thought). Then, the social issues... as monoculture plants themselves are aggressively invasive, so is the culture surrounding them. Monoculture agriculture affects local agriculture culture practices (such an ironical level of meta-redundant tongue twister). One of the chief issues is that, due to its higher revenue, farmers opt for abandoning the production of other plants, which in turn affects the locally produced food supply of their communities, which makes necessary for food to be brought from outside, which creates inflation, which makes people seek more reliable sources of income, which may in the end turn them back to palm oil production, feeding the cycle. And this is nothing to say that the conjoined issues created by land appropriation (legal or otherwise), which creates the classic human disputes that are such a seedbed for strife.<br><br><br>And these are merely the mayor, easy-to-pop-off-your-head issues... who knows how many things are necessary before Plant-based industry can become a proper, sustainable part of our Sid Meier&#39;s-style civilization (a perfect simulator to illustrate my points on the issue of &#39;invasiveness&#39;). Truly, this weird, ENDANGERED trees poke at the roots (pun intended) of so many of our current world problems. If we are seriously considering adding hyperaccumultors to our arsenal of world-changing crops (and we ARE doing it already), then I think it is time to REALLY sit down and truly see the big picture. Our social ecosystem is as unbalanced as the artificial ecosystems we have created through industrial-scale agriculture. Like I said above, in a not-so-jokingly fashion, this hits the roots of our problems, including, but not limited to: <br><br><br>-Our reckless search for short-term gain<br><br>-Our irresponsible approach to the environment and our own culture<br>-The basic, underlying flaws and limitations of our modern society when confronted with systems with such high order of complexity as the ecosystem of THE PLANET WHERE WE LIVE<br>-The untenable situation of the modern society that still refuses to address these issues<br><br><br>And many, many more human-born problems...<br><br><br>What are our solutions? For yes, even something as this can be fixed... if we set our minds to it.<br>How about eco-social community designs? If we can make a balanced garden by adding plants that complement and help each other survive, can we integrate industries that co-exist in a balanced fashion, filling the niches in-between?<br>How about reevaluating and restructuring our commercial markets and industries? So much is wasted that could be used/applied to other areas, from resources to techniques. Synergy is a practice that yields good economical results, imagine what would happen if that model of thought could be applied to these issues.<br>And what about governments? Policies, when applied properly, can boost both the society and the economy, and be fair to the individual.<br>But, what about our own ideologies that fuel the issues and choke the solutions? Our approach to all the issues is sadly narrow and one-track minded, but if we realize that we can fix our environment, our societies, our ideologies, AND STILL PROFIT FROM IT (renewable energy&#39;s emerging market, anyone?), then yes<br><br><br>These trees truly represent the seed of a new future.<br><br><br>Sorry for the long post.", "comment_date": "2020-04-02T15:53:27Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Corbinite", "comment_text": "aw new caledonia gets all the cool trees", "comment_date": "2020-04-02T15:17:08Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "George Evgeniou", "comment_text": "How can you pay attention without looking at the cow ring :(", "comment_date": "2020-04-02T14:43:07Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Moon Moon", "comment_text": "Won\u2019t lie.
