At the bottom of it (you know where the water usually sits), instead of water, piping and such, there was simply a lid. You do your business, and when you &quot;flush&quot; it opens the lid and the waste just --- it drops down under the moving train. I always thought that was really weird and gross. I mean imagine, you&#39;re going on a nice nature walk, you happen upon a railroad and there -- right in the middle of the railroad --- you see a pile of poop! lol<br><br>p.s. some other train models didn&#39;t even have the lid so you can literally look down and see the railroad and when you&#39;re seating down to do your business, you can feel a nice breeze so you&#39;re getting &quot;aired out&quot; while doing your business :D", "comment_date": "2018-06-03T23:24:42Z", "likes_count": 350}, {"comment_by": "Ideoform Sun", "comment_text": "I think it&#39;s time for an update on how we handle human and animal manure.  Mixing poop with our fresh drinking water is just plain wasteful.  <br>We are depleting our valuable soils by not returning nutrients like selenium to the soil.  <br>Also, we use very toxic chemicals to clean our toilets, and this gets added to the drinking water, too.  All of which ends up back in the very same lakes streams and aquifers that we take our drinking water from.  <br>In our city, we made the bad choice to combine our rainwater sewers with our wastewater sewage.  This was to save money at the time, but has caused a huge, massively expensive problem in the present day.  Now every time it rains hard, raw sewage gets dumped into our freshwater lake......from which we get our city water.  <br>Furthermore, when cancer patients flush, extremely toxic chemotherapy drugs, which cause cancer, ends up in our water, and the water treatment plants were never designed to remove such things as drugs, hormones, and antibiotics.  <br>We have to add a further toxic chemical, chlorine, which reacts with other things in the water, creating further toxins.  <br>Chlorine interferes with thyroid hormones, causing us trouble regulating our metabolisms.  <br>Fluoride also interferes with thyroid hormones.  They add it as an antibiotic, but it is toxic to your bones and thyroid.<br><br>In nature, urine is naturally mostly sterile, and is a great nutrient for plants, especially when diluted with rainwater.  Manure is very biodegradable and this works best when it is not put directly into water, unless you are a fish.  <br><br>We need a system where we can use grey water to mix with the urine, and return it to the soil, in some way that plants have access to it.  And we need a way to keep the manure out of our water, and compost it safely to return the essential nutrients to the soil, without contaminating it on the way with toxic cleaning chemicals, and antibiotics (&quot;sanitizers&quot;).  <br><br>Everybody says&quot;Eewww!  Put urine and poop on the soil...&quot;. But we are putting it in our water, which when diluted, allows it to leech into our groundwater, leaking into our wells, and contaminating our fresh water.  That&#39;s worse.  Poop is biologically safe when composted.  (Even though it&#39;s still got drugs in it, if you are using them.)<br><br>For millions of years plants and animals have recycled literally everything:  sun, air, water, dirt.
