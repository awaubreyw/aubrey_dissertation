With bipedalism, the rotator cuff, which allows us to throw overhand instead of underhand, another trait unique to humans, and our ability to pivot our pelvis, we could not only toss objects, but throw rocks and spears for hunting and self-defense.  He argued our ability to hunt from range (again, unique to humans) is the key to us eventually having enough excess resources to develop bigger brains, and later on avoid oppression (a child can kill an adult with a rock, while a lion cub is at the mercy of its parents) to set up societies that were more complex than &quot;I am the biggest, so I lead.&quot;  This positive feed back looped, as after we gave up hunting and gathering, women could gestate for 9 months, leading to more altricial offspring.<br><br>The theory, I think, explains human anatomy extremely well.  Big lower body muscles and sweating is definitely indicators that we chase prey to exhaustion, but throwing explains why we have good eye sight (identifying snakes are another explanation for eyesight), are bipedal and have rotator cuffs.  I don&#39;t even know if being bipedal is actually better for marathon running, it&#39;s not particularly aerodynamic, and it doesn&#39;t necessarily always increase surface area for cooling, but this is just me speculating.  I think being furless and sweating is much more important.  If we were exclusively power scavengers or exhaustion based hunters, the link to increased brain development, greater visual acuity and particularly the rotator cuff would continue to remain a mystery, imo.  I think we were able to become dominant cause we could do all, attack from range, chase down, or steal the kill in case someone else beat us to it, and I think our evolution is multi-faceted; we were responding to all the variables, not just one.", "comment_date": "2022-08-24T00:17:35Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Deny the Zeitgeist", "comment_text": "Oh wow.

Well, funny as it is, we&#39;re really the only species who sits as much as we do.  Probably because we only have the 2 legs and are having to do work close to the ground.  Whether for making things or cooking things or anything.  You couldn&#39;t sit if you didn&#39;t have a butt!! <br><br>Also, riddle me this please:   if we all just came out of some primordial ooze then why are there still single called organisms?

I know there&#39;s no one else, unless he is getting money for it from elsewhere, because he is still getting his pension put in my bank, and I can see all of his expenditures. Yet, I don&#39;t know why he tossed 40 years in the trash and walked away without a care. I will never know.

Here&#39;s how:  Gently SLOWLY insert the q tip into your ear. Hold the q tip with your thumb and index finger directly against the outside of your ear, so that you CANNOT insert it any further into your ear. Then gently twist the q tip to remove the wax. DO NOT change your position of grip on the q tip.  So, very simple, unless of course you&#39;re an idiot and insist on pushing it in further. This is why they have to tell EVERYONE to never insert anything into their ears, all because of the morons who are too stupid to avoid hurting themselves due to their own stupidity. Oh, and if you are one of those who think, &#39;Well, I&#39;M smart, and I still accidentally hurt myself by sticking a q tip into my ear&#39;, well, maybe you&#39;re not actually as smart as you think you are.  After all, if you aren&#39;t supposed to stick a q tip into your ear, then WHY ARE THEY MADE LIKE THAT?

The &quot;scientists&quot; who created it, said themselves, that everything we know can only be so, given there is a creator, but since they&#39;re bias, and they &quot;know&quot; that there is &quot;no creator&quot;, there must be an explanation that allow all of this to happen on accident.  Hence the multiverse theory.  Where there are so many unlimited amounts of multiverses, that one MUST statistically be bound to have all of these &quot;accidents&quot; occur, so that our universe, galaxy, planet, and life within it, can happen ALL ON ACCIDENT.

If you are going to create videos and display them in the public domain with the guise of being educational it should be supported with some form of evidence and there just isn&#39;t any.

As I stated earlier you&#39;ve created a video in the past that was loaded with inaccurate information, I didn&#39;t hear about this video until Shad Brooks from the channel Shadversity covered it, I&#39;m aware I may have some unfair bias as a content creator I enjoy has covered this video of yours but there&#39;s merit to the criticism in that video.<br><br>If you&#39;re creating educational content or your claim something to be factual you must present evident for that or you risk making your claim far less valid than thy otherwise would be. There is plenty of information in this video that logically made sense to me and I thought to myself &quot;Well that seems obvious / self explanatory / accurate&quot; .

You&#39;re creating this video to educate but I&#39;m having to chase down the sources to verify that what&#39;s being said is accurate and factual?<br>I guess I&#39;m just disappointed and annoyed that there&#39;s no direct sources here and I have to go to other videos to get to those sources as well but even then a lot of sources.

This is an outdated idea that has been pretty thoroughly disproven in the orthodontic literature. Yes, they can come in impacted (sideways) and definitely cause problems back there, but the idea that they can push and create enough force to cause crowding in the front teeth simply isn\u2019t true. There\u2019s way too many teeth in between that disperse the wisdom tooth eruption pressure-  the pressure is dissipated after at most, the first molar. Teeth are a pain in the ass to move, and the eruption force generated isn\u2019t that strong. This is like saying you can stand behind your house and push on the back wall and cause the front wall of the house to move. Way too much anchorage in between. <br><br>The real cause is \u201clate mandibular growth\u201d, which is a minor but normal growth period of the lower jaw experienced in late-adolescence/early adulthood (same time the wisdom teeth are coming in). The lower jaw grows down and forward, taking the roots of your lower incisors (front teeth) along for the ride. Since the tops of these teeth are trapped behind the upper incisors, the overall result is a tipping backwards (towards the tongue) of those teeth, causing them to overlap. The degree to which people experience this late mandibular growth varies, but it\u2019s a normal process that happens to everyone. It\u2019s why even people who get their wisdom teeth removed as teenagers will get this same type of lower incisor crowding in early adulthood, which many people attribute to orthodontic relapse or not wearing their retainers. This is still a widely believed myth, especially among dentists (most know little about orthodontics) or older orthodontists who haven\u2019t stayed current with the literature. It was accepted as fact for decades, but many recent and thorough longitudinal growth studies show it\u2019s definitely late mandibular growth causing the problems, not wisdom teeth.

Eyebrows and eyelashes are there to catch falling debris and anything small coming toward the eyes by \u201ccatching\u201d it in our eyebrows or protecting the eyeballs by blocking entrance with eyelashes debris would get tangled/trapped in.

Nose hair, mucus (or the more scientific word of boogers, boogie oogies, or a \u201cbat in the cave\u201d) do the same in collecting intrusive bacteria in our boogers and move our boogers along the cilia in our nose to be swallowed and our stomach acid dissolves and destroys those intrusions trapped within our nose gunk.
