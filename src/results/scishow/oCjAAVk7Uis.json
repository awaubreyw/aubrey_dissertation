Humanity seems to be losing its ability to think critically and or humanity has more individuals without the capacity to think critically than it does individuals who do think critically.<br><br>Part of the reason for this is the mere existence of all religion and the human propensity to believing in the supernatural.

Yeah because that gene causes some of its bearers to die before 70. This is not selection pressure though, because most humans reproduce long before that. The default expectation would be that there is no selection pressure on this gene, and this data doesn&#39;t suggest anything to the contrary.<br><br>The researchers then studied a younger generation and their parents, using the younger gen as a proxy (which is fine, they have 50% of the genes after all). Now they said they found a small effect but that it was statistically NOT significant. This is exactly what you&#39;d expect if there&#39;s no effect and they happened to get lucky. Which happens all the time even if something is declared &quot;statistically significant&quot;! (see also: p-hacking).<br><br>Then we get to the theoretical basis behind why anyone might even think that a gene that only has an effect on people over 70 might be selected for or against...and that hypothesis is not very persuasive based on everything we know. There&#39;s very little direct selection pressure due to child-bearing people not being affected by Alzheimer&#39;s until long after they&#39;ve raised the child. So the best hypothesis they can come up with is saying that the grandparents increase the fitness of the grandkids.<br><br>That is known by the technical jargon &quot;Group selection&quot; and we know enough about this to know that if it has any effect, it would be extremely small, and basically undetectable among noise in the data, which is also consistent with what they found, as mentioned earlier...<br><br>Basically, group selection effects are really weak because they drop off exponentially. A child has only 50% of your genes, and a grandchild has 25%. Something that helps you survive is twice as effective at spreading your genes as something that helps only your children, and four times as effective as helping only your grandchildren. Any impact on survival is diluted by a power of two for every generation.<br><br>And we haven&#39;t even started to mention the general uncertainty and chaos that comes with longer periods of time; not every grandparent ends up in a situation where they influence the lives of their grandkids. And especially in modern society where the current trend is moving away from multi-generational family units, this effect, if it ever existed, will only get weaker.<br><br>A much better explanation is actually seen here in some of the comments: with modern science people might change family-planning behaviour.

The idea is that the presence of a grandmother can make a huge difference in whether or not a child survives to adulthood. And it has been supported in a number of studies among poorer populations where childcare is often nonexistent. In those areas, they found that whether or not the father was in the picture didn&#39;t make anywhere as big of a difference as to whether or not a grandmother was present.<br><br>I think it kind of breaks down in modern first world nations (especially in the US and Canada) in some regards due to how we&#39;re encouraged to spread out and not rely on our parents in any way after we reach adulthood. But even here, there&#39;s tons of ppl who chose to move close to their parents when they have kids (especially when the kids are very young and the parents are inexperienced) for access to advice and assistance in childcare. And having extended family members that you can turn to in times of financial and/or physical stress can be the difference between life and death at times. Financial difficulties is a major reason behind suicides in many parts of the world - and especially here in the Midwest.<br><br>My cousins on my dad&#39;s side of the family were all babysat by my grandma after school and when they were too young for school - and the same is true for their kids until Grandma died in 2018 (as in their great grandmother babysat them). My cousins on my mom&#39;s side of the family were tutored by my grandmother every summer as my grandma was an elementary teacher prior to retiring (she practically lived with them every summer break) and my aunt insisted on homeschooling despite not knowing anything about teaching or any of the subject material.<br><br>I remember when I was struggling to learn the multiplication tables, Grandma came down and worked with me that summer to help me memorize them. I didn&#39;t actually put together what multiplication actually was and how it worked until years later - during Geometry when we were learning proofs, if I recall correctly. My teachers just focused on having us memorize them. They didn&#39;t care about explaining how it worked or why.<br><br>Edit: And I probably shouldn&#39;t have paused and typed all this up.

Fahrenheit gives you nearly double the precision of Celsius without decimals - approximately 1.8x the accuracy. People are very sensitive to small shifts in temperature, why would you want to measure those changes in temperature less accurately on a daily basis? Beyond remembering that freezing (which is more often used in daily life than boiling, where I am) is 32 degrees Fahrenheit and that the difference between freezing and boiling is 180 degrees, it isn&#39;t difficult.

Survival in today&#39;s world looks quite different from survival a couple thousand years ago. <br>For instance, my life was saved by modern medicine before reproductive age; my genes would&#39;ve likely killed me but now I get to pass them on (yay for me, sorry kiddos). I assume there are millions of people like me with not-so-top-notch genes that survive and reproduce who otherwise wouldn&#39;t,  which leads me to think that we&#39;re... devolving thanks to modern medicine and ease of access to food and water.  <br><br>There is still sexual selection but basically anyone with a lot of money can have kids at this point, and money as an attractive feature doesn&#39;t have directly to do with genes like strength or fitness (there are probably associated traits being selected for, which probably come from nuture, not just nature). A mate may be allured by money and willing to forego their sexual phenotypic preferences (not that that&#39;s a bad thing to do, money can mean safety and security). Or a female could pay for sperm donation (and there must be an equivalent surrogacy service for males).<br><br>Genetic drift will never be overridden but it&#39;s more powerful in small populations. There are 7.8 billion of us and we&#39;re moving around all of the time.<br><br><br>Scishow, I would love to see a video on the impact of modernity on the process of evolution and how we are projected to be evolving.

That last argument seems wrong. I\u2019m not a biologist, but isn\u2019t it natural that genes that effect lifespans differ in younger populations from living older populations? For example, if we could add all the people who would be in that age group had they not died, wouldn\u2019t the gene frequency of those alleles be the same in the expanded older group as the younger group? It certainly would be a rapid evolutionary change if in a mere few generations in which medicine has been good enough that Alzheimers can actually get a turn at killing enough that we\u2019re already so strongly selecting against that chance that we can see a noticeable change in these population genomes.

In addition there could be benefits to that gene earlier in life that actually leads to it becoming more common in the population instead of less.  This gene can enhance innate immunity by increasing the inflammatory response which could increase the survival of young children especially.  Some of the side effects are increased, heart disease, stroke, and alzhemiers, but those generally do not affect people until after they have reproduced.
