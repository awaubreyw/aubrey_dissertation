Given that various Corona Viruses are the cause of the common cold and Covid-19 and its near relatives are members of the same &#39;family&#39; of viruses Is it possible that a single vaccine for Covid 19 might be made that would also defeat SARS, MERS and the COMMON COLD?? What cellular surface protein does the common cold virus link to? As well as the other steps in the process? This full range vaccine I am speaking of would obviously be a huge aid to the health of the human race.

Is there anything we DO know?  After 6 months of frantic study of this surreal puzzle of a disease, are we sure of anything?  Kids usually don&#39;t get sick (except when they die or almost die), but even when asymptomatic, they have a larger viral load than adults.  WHY?  People may be able to get reinfected, and there&#39;s no good evidence of how long immunity lasts (if it exists at all), yet we&#39;re staking our social and economic futures on a vaccine.  WHY?  The virus apparently can pass the blood-brain barrier via some bulb or another, but it usually doesn&#39;t.  WHY?  The virus can attack seemingly almost any organ in the body, yet some people don&#39;t get sick at all, and there&#39;&#39;s no pattern as to who does and who doesn&#39;t.  WHY?  The most severe cases seem to be caused by the body&#39;s own immune response, yet some people don&#39;t have an immune response at all, and there&#39;s no pattern as to who does and who doesn&#39;t.  WHY?  After over a hundred years of experience with the germ theory of disease and victories over a huge range of once-deadly infections, human society has been brought to its knees by something a pangolin caught from a bat and passed to a human in a wet market -- or something created experimentally in a Chinese lab that got loose by accident -- or that didn&#39;t come from China at all.
