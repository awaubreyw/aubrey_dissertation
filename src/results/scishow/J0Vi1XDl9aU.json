I always cut back on feeding the squirrels at fall. So they can hide the walnuts from my backyard tree. It&#39;s good that they can have a back up storage. And during winter, I do end up putting out shell peanuts for the squirrels to find when digging in the snow while they search. The loose seed and nuts I throw out are for the birds and chipmunks. A mix for everyone though. Usually toss before the sun comes up. That way they eat early to help raise their body temp during the cold winter months. There is so much wildlife in our neighborhood. And competition for food gets crazy. Besides that I really enjoy watching them while having coffee.
