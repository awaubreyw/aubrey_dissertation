That&#39;s called optogenetics. Those genes are transported in neurons by a virus and are then able to create opsins, which are proteins sensitive to light. But those opsins can only sense light on a certain frequency. So the patient had to use specific goggles turning every day light into specific frequency light to make it work. Finally, after 7 months of this treatment, the brain adapted to those new signals coming from the opsins and the patient partly recovered his vision from the one eye that was treated. Got it !<br>Then, the highest concentration of mercury in nature were recorded in the meltwater of greenland. Which is terrible because mercury is both highly toxic and extremly hard to get rid of once it&#39; in the body,  and also Greenland economy relies on selling fishes. So if these fishes are contaminated by mercury, people who eat them will be too. question now : Why is there mercury ? Researchers think mercury comes from &quot;bedrock erosion or geothermical activty&quot;, because proportions of mercury found under the glacier were higher than in the snow on top of the glacier. Secondly, organisms living under the glacier were found with adaptations to mercury, meaning that they were used to mercury in such proportions.
