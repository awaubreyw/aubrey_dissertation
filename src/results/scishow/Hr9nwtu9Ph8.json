My take on it was that my memory and attention span got better, i felt less tired, and mainly, i understood that i was earing way too many carbs. It brought me around to better nutrition. My understanding after all my &#39;experiment&#39; was that i probably was starting on some sort of insulin deregulation. Now, 20 years after, i continue to see carbs as a necessary restriction. I still eat them, but if i reduce them a lot, i feel better. With the idea that natural carbs are found in fruits and veggies, there is no need to overload on the refined carbs. Love fruits and veggies! But i have to resist my drug, which is sugar in any form.

Personally i&#39;ve learned that eating carbs get your body to make the most insulin because carbs (except fiber) only turn into glucose and that&#39;s all they do while fat can be used for storing glucose along with other stuff and it has very little insulin response and then proteins still provoke a decent quantity of insulin but nowhere near as high as carbs and well if there&#39;s any excess of protein that your body can&#39;t use it will simply turn into sugar.

Just one thing, you mentioned that with a Keto diet the lack of carbs means your body is not storing glucose, so you lose that weight and the associated water that binds with it.  Whilst this is true, it is also true if you have carbs in your diet.  Any diet for weight loss requires a calorie deficit over time and your body is not storing glycogen when you are in a calorie deficit.  Obviously with any diet you go into a calorie surplus when you eat and then back into a deficit between meals, depending on meal timings, etc., but once you have been in an overall deficit for a while, all of your glycogen is used up and, whilst a small amount will get replaced when you eat, once you return to a calorie deficit it will get used up straight away.  This is why most people experience rapid weight loss when they first start a diet, because of the depletion of glycogen and the associated water that binds to it, regardless of type of diet.  On average this accounts for 0.5kg of glycogen and 2kg of water, which is roughly equivalent to 2500kcals of stored energy.<br><br>That 2500kcals of stored energy in the form of glycogen is the reason that training your body to use fat as fuel is really effective for endurance athletes, because they will frequently burn more than 2500kcals in an event and, whilst they can take on carbs during the event, even slower releasing carbs create somewhat of an unstable energy availability, due to the peaks and troughs of blood glucose levels created by consumption and insulin response.  Fat cells on the other hand, although taking longer for the body to access the energy are limited only by a person&#39;s body fat percentage and, even a very lean athlete will have tens of thousands kcals stored.  As the body gets used to using fat as fuel, it becomes more efficient at it, but it is still slower than using glucose, which is why it&#39;s not good for bursts of energy, but for endurance it&#39;s more than fast enough.", "comment_date": "2020-09-23T06:02:55Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Bill Does Stuff", "comment_text": "Just look at the nomadic Masai of Africa too.

The main focus of a Low Carb/High Fat diet is to keep insulin at it&#39;s proper level - i.e. low most of the time - which leads to greater insulin sensitivity and the production of ketones from stored fat. When practiced effectively (which is relatively easy once you get the hang of it), Ketosis quickly makes the obese return to normal weight, reverses insulin resistance, reduces inflammation, and can actually reverse type 2 diabetes in many people (by which I mean they can go off medication.)

It was prescribed to epilepsy patients because the ketones produced by the body for whatever reason helped with epilepsy, and they noticed weight just falling off patients. Eventually someone realized how much money could be made off of that. To so many people, the fact that it&#39;s so good at making you lose weight means it must be healthy, because that&#39;s all they think health is. But the fact that it&#39;s so good at it is what makes it unhealthy. Rapid weight loss is in and of itself destructive, not just the methods people use to get there. It&#39;s not only bad to lose weight extremely fast if you&#39;re starving yourself, the weight loss itself can harm you. Your body needs stability. Fat is basically an organ, it&#39;s not only for storing energy, it also acts as a buffer for the endocrine system, and is important to the immune system. A number of studies have even shown that people with higher amounts of body fat, while faring worse in some ways, actually get benefits as well (even scientists which go into studies with the idea that being on the heavy side is always bad, consistently find evidence that fat people do well in terms of mortality rates and show that health has far more to do with lifestyle and nutrition than weight. Many of scientists have found this research unacceptable under current norms but have been unable to dismantle it try as they might). Basically cutting out half of one of your organs in a couple months and just leaving the rest of your body to adjust without even so much as a recovery period is never good. There&#39;s a reason why our bodies only metabolize ketones when absolutely necessary. We were never meant to live off of them. <br><br>What this teaches us is that humans can survive on anything. We can adapt to anything. We&#39;re opportunate omnivores. But we weren&#39;t meant to just survive. You can get your nutrients from a variety of sources and put restrictions on where you get your food, and as long as you make sure you get decent nutritional balance, and compensate when needed, you&#39;ll do great. But when you start putting restrictions on what kinds of nutrients you&#39;re allowed to eat, as most fad diets do, very few people can come out of that healthy, unless you actually have generations upon generations of ancestors adapting to eating that way, as the inuit do. It&#39;s why 80+ percent of people who diet gain the weigh back, and just end up trying to lose it their whole lives, and most people who do have success in losing weight used to be thin anyway rather than being people who were fat their whole lives. People have made one single oversimplified facet of health into their entire goal and will strain their body and psyche to convince themselves they&#39;ve achieved it. Intuitive eating, trusting our bodies to provide us with the proper instincts as it has for millions of years, is for the vast majority of people, the best thing they can do for themselves (barring certain preexisting physical or mental health conditions). But our culture has such a moralizing view of food and nutrients that that&#39;s inconceivable to most people. Don&#39;t torture yourself.<br><br>I&#39;ve worked at a bookstore that sold diet books. I watched as keto books took over and the customers who live off of diet books seemed to become more and more self-hating in how they spoke of themselves in the checkout line, and became more and more obsessive about everything they buy and eat having to align perfectly with what these books say they need to do. And in this trend, sales of diet books went up. I&#39;ve seen plenty of people and even a couple of researchers (by no means a majority) claim it gets easy after a few weeks but I look at their behavior, I look at how they speak about themselves, I look at their spending habits, and I look at how they have to forcedly laugh off offers of even a single cookie as if they&#39;re in a hostage situation because metabolizing glucose could ruin their streak, I just don&#39;t see it. It&#39;s obsessive, and it&#39;s not truly about health. It&#39;s barely even about weight loss, though that&#39;s the lie people have been trained to chase after to keep this going. It&#39;s really just all about money. If it was about anything else the narrative wouldn&#39;t be constantly switching back and forth. It was low-carb, then it was low-fat, now it&#39;s high-fat no-carbs, and now I&#39;m seeing the industry start to switch back to claiming fats are evil, fearmongering and calling olive oil deadly. There&#39;s no stability. Because if there was stability, people could stick to something long enough to realize it never actually was going to work for them. Instead before they get the chance to finally realize they&#39;re fighting a battle with no solution, they&#39;re sold on the next thing that will supposedly &quot;fix&quot; all the problems they&#39;re told they have. It&#39;s on a three to seven year cycle these days, and getting faster. Just watch, this time next year it&#39;ll all be back to pushing diets with little to no triglycerides at all.

The meat they got by two means - by running down prey in hot weather on the African plains (difficult), and by chasing away predators from their kills (easy and the preferred method). The nutrition they got from chasing away predators from their kills had a very high fat content because by the time they got there, the predators would have eaten a lot of the meat. Our ancestors could break the bones apart with stone tools to get at the bone marrow and brain - which are mostly fat. So the keto diet was our normal diet going back at least 2 million years and only changed 5000 years ago. The body&#39;s glucose burning mode which switches in when you eat more than 20 grammes of carbohydrates a day is an equally old adaptation to make use of fruits and seeds available during short fruiting and seed production seasons to fatten up. When these are available, your body instructs you to pig out on these, and the normal controls in a ketosis state against overeating when you eat too much are suspended. <br>It should be noted that a high protein diet isn&#39;t the keto diet.

However, the interesting thing again, is this idea that weight loss cannot be maintained on a keto diet. This is actually not the case, and there are many studies on that as well. Further, studies that have compared diets have quite a bit of methodological flawas.  They also show comparative results in the weight loss department - but don&#39;t all discuss the improvements in metabolic markers in the end. A glaring methodolocical flaw, is comparing weight loss and control, without maintaining strict/ correct parameters for &quot;keto&quot; through the duration of the study. <br><br><br>An example of looking at weight control under the hood, is the ketogenic diet&#39;s impact on hunger related to physiological changes in circulating leptin and ghrelin hormomes. These greatly stabilize on a ketogenic diet - essentially, leaving you more satisfied and not craving. The other thing that is not discussed in this video, is the improvement in many other metabolic factors that are also related to weight loss and control, such as - hsCRP levels, insulin, blood glucose and HbA1c, waist circumference, blood pressure, reductions in triglycerides, and increased HDL levels. LDL in some people increase but usually they are the larger particles, as opposed to the small dense artherogenic particles involved with cardiovascular diseases. All these things matter in weight loss and maintenance and they work behind the scenes. for example--- how can you maintain a positive desire for weight loss if your MD tells you after 1year, that your blood pressure is high, and hbA1c level is prediabetic? the ketogenic diet is very well known for reducing both those issues! And as such - most people are motivated to continue with their weight maintenance journey.<br><br><br>The most compelling thing is about motivation. Many many studies on this have shown that people just more motivated to do something about their weight when they see results. That is one of the quickest things the keto diet will do due to the initial water losses - but this does not mean its only water. No, biochemically, fats will also be burned and yes you will lose adipose tissue. So ultimately - seeing the results is quite motivating and enough for most people to keep doing it. No other diet can really do that as functionally well as this one and continue to maintain good blood markers. <br><br><br>Further, once adapted to this way of utilizing ketones and glucose dynamically in the body, human physiology is primed for fuel partitioning as per food availability. With the decopuling to sugar and carb addiction - the human body can start to utilize proper food sources in an effective manner. So, yes you can transition to a lower carb diet of healthy carbs (whole plants, not garbage cookies and cakes), and you will still be able to maintain your weight. Again, the diet is controlled during the initial burn in to let the body adapt - after which some carbs can be added. This part has to be individualized as some people handle carbs differently from others as part of their genetic makeup. <br><br><br>Ultimately, though this is a good  video - it omits some key components regarding the longevity of wt control compared to other diets. Yes weight loss can be similar - but in terms of nutrient density of the ketogenic diet, and metabolic markers exclusive of weight control, the ketogenic diet tends to do better - -and who knows, longer trials may shown severe reductions in carb addiction via changes in brain chemistry. <br><br><br>All diets have to be monitored as they tend to affect people in unique ways. And yes, different diets can work for different people. However, overarchingly, this diet affects both brain chemistry and metabolism in many beneficial ways. And yes, glucose and its requirement for HIIT and short burst anaerobic activity, is absolutely essential. Fats are not utilized well for that. so Agreed - glucose has its place in those activities. But the issue with exogenous glucose (in the forms of sugar and its many iterations) is that its addictive properties have been vastly exploited by the food and drug industries - causing insidious changes in brain chemistry as well as subsequent metabolic derangements. <br><br><br>Exogenous glucose is fine - but how much can you handle before addiction sets in? <br><br><br>I&#39;ll choose a low carb high fat diet any day, and if I&#39;m doing HIIT aerobic training, I&#39;ll add in some additional healthy carbs like fruit/ and potatoes.

High meat diets are not ketogenic diets since proteins increase insulin levels. Carnivore diets generally require organ meats for vitamins and to not result in low baseline insulin levels by themselves. The association with insulin in many health issues including brain issues is insulin resistance and metabolic disorders. This is typically derived by long term ingestion of simple carbohydrates - not complex carbohydrates found in most fruits and vegetables. Thus a complex carb diet can produce similar affects to keto - but might also require intermittent fasting to suppress insulin. Intermittent fasting is found to be very helpful in all of these diets because it forces baseline insulin levels down for extended periods of time - at least 12 hours - and this can reduce health problems associated with metabolic disorders.

Type 2 diabetes, depression, anxiety, other mental issues. I do not say healing because once you go off keto those issues tends to come right back (at least for me and a lot of others), therefore keto is not a cure, but a way to manage.

I started having seizures in high school (non-epileptic, though - caused by severe chronic pain). Oh, several of the dozens of doctors suggested cutting wheat (and/or carbs, though this was before Atkins) and eatting more meat. We soon realized that their stupid suggestions were making things drastically worse! The problem they never bothered to clue in on? I can&#39;t digest meat. After eating even small amounts of meat, my insides seize up in horrifically painful spasms that leave me writhing and screaming in agony for hours. Wheat is perfectly fine (in fact I pretty much live on wheat gluten, as the most body-friendly protien out there, at least for my body, which is also soy intolerant). Rice milk is much easier on my system than real milk, as well. (So much for the doctors&#39; dumb &quot;grain free&quot; idea...) As for high fat, yeah, that too can trigger a seizure. My gall bladder stopped working in the 90s and they removed it (which only made things FAR worse, I might add), so my body can&#39;t process high fat foods (or here comes waves of horrid abdominal pain and seizures once again). To make matters even worse, without the use of sugar before meals, it is gut-wrenchingly painful to try to eat, and I cannot manage more than a few bites. (Even on the few occassions I&#39;ve managed to do so, eating without sugar before the meal is a recipe for disaster, as this will make me VERY sick for the rest of the day. &quot;Sick&quot; = pain and seizures.) In short, every single part of the Ketogenic diet is the exact opposite of what my body needs to stay seizure-free. Now, I can never maintain a 100% seizure-free life, largely because there are other problems that can and do cause bouts of extreme pain and over which I have no control (most notably a certain &quot;monthly&quot; issue for us girls, which basically hasn&#39;t worked right in 20 years). Since pain is the currency upon which my seizures run, there are never any guarantees. Still, with a carefully balanced diet of vegetarian food (read: wheat gluten or &quot;mock duck&quot;), rice milk, going easy on &quot;hard&quot; vegetables (that cause me to have lengthy bouts of diarrhea), and significant spurts of sugar before every meal,  I do fairly well. I don&#39;t lose much weight, but I&#39;m not bedridden either. (I tend to only lose much weight when I am bedridden for at least 2 months on end, usually because my body stops accepting solid food at all - and no, I can&#39;t drink most &quot;meal replacement&quot; shakes because their fiber content exceeds the restricted amount I&#39;m allowed, no more than 5g per meal or a total of 10g a day, i.e. 1/3rd of the normal recommended daily allowance.) Yeah, being me is... fun? -.-;<br><br><br>TL;DR - If you do have signifcant health concerns, don&#39;t wait for a doctor or anyone else to tell you what&#39;s right for your body. You&#39;ll have to figure it out for yourself. Whatever works for you and makes you feel better is what you should eat. (And really, people, we should stop trying to tell others what will &quot;cure&quot; them. Chances are, your special diet, essential oils, or whatever won&#39;t cure a long-term health issue, and you&#39;re probably not qualified to give advice on such things, anyway.

Keto is definitely low carb, protein amount is based on your lean body mass, but the amount of fat you consume is dependent on how much of a calorie deficit you want to be in for weight loss, if you want to lose weight at all. Keto isn&#39;t just for weight loss so you can remain on a keto &quot;diet&quot; (eating style) once you hit maintenance, you just have to up your calorie intake in the form of fat. Since fat is so calorically dense it&#39;s easy to do. Also, I believe that keto is better for losing weight because insulin is a hunger hormone, and consuming carbs makes you produce more insulin than if you consume protein and fat.

From November to Feb I lost 50 lbs. Now I just stay on it probably 90% of the week. I also fast intermittently . My diet consisted of wings bacon, sausage, and a salad with chicken breast. One a day vitamins and a ginko biloba extract.  Low carb sauces are used to help keep the diet enjoyable.  I do cheat from time to time so I just fast till I get it back. For some reason it&#39;s really easy to fast after cheating for a night. I don&#39;t even get hungry till later in the day so it&#39;s pretty easy and sipping water helps. I also did this diet while I still smoked weed everyday of the week. Munchies were not near as bad on this diet. Chicken wings always hit the spot. Just make sure you either use a low carb sauce or a seasoning. Seasonings will add more sodium though.<br><br><br> I think the weightloss if you combine intermittent fasting is shocking. basically 4 months and I lost almost 20% of my body weight. Family and friends were shocked every time they saw me cause I had lost more weight.  Actually worried about me. I say you should give it a try. Just be serious and follow it for at least two weeks. Weigh yourself daily at the same time. Usually the am. You&#39;ll see a rapid loss at first due to water weight, but the rate that I was losing weight was shocking even after the first few weeks. I was losing about 5 to 8lbs a week. I will mention that I have an active lifestyle and job. I&#39;m on my feet all day. My fitbit usually averages 20k steps a day. I usually have around 2 hours of intense activity. If i worked out that day or worked most of the day it&#39;s closer to 4 hours.  Just keep it in mind. If you have a office job or something where your inactive for most of the day you wont see the same amount of loss. <br><br><br>One of the biggest pluses of the diet is you don&#39;t crash all freakin day.  I just got a promotion because i&#39;ve been able to bust my ass nonstop at work since I adjusted to this diet. I think like he said the diet&#39;s endurance is a high level. You have so much stamina over the course of the day. When I ate a lot of carbs I always crashed around 2 to 5pm. That doesn&#39;t happen anymore I feel strong pretty much all day. <br><br><br>One negative and Michael covered it in the video  is It doesn&#39;t help as much when your trying to build muscle or get gains in a gym. After working out pretty regularly I can say that carbs are so much better for gains. I can push myself much farther If I Carb load the night before. I&#39;ll typically fast from when i cheat the night before till about 18 hours later. Then i&#39;ll eat something with no carbs and fast till the next day. That morning I&#39;m usually back in ketosis.  So I&#39;d advise light cardio and some medium weightlifting if your on the diet. Pushing yourself will make you tired and I usually eat if I tire out from pushing myself in the gym. Wait till maybe you reach your goal then go back to a carb diet and workout? <br><br><br>I&#39;m not an expert of dieting, but maybe someone can dissect it that knows whats actually going on.
