Our brains will just sit in a vacuum/pressure chamber with artificial CSF that can be pumped in and out. As long as our computers and batteries don&#39;t die on us, and we can keep making more CSF, our brain could probably live way longer without a body. Way better for the environment too, and life would just be something way different. I mean, why even use a robot? We could just put our brains inside a simulation or game. Everything we see, feel, hear,  taste, etc is just electrical signals.
