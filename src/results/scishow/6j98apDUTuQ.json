If the sources explain how that&#39;s possible, it&#39;s beyond my understanding.  It&#39;s something about lower energy state, but why would a proton in the nucleus of an atom go to a lower energy state (enough energy to make up the difference in mass to become a neutron AND create some other particles) just by being in the nucleus of a different element when the reaction is finished?
