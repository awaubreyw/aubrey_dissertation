The only antibody types that can cross are IgG1, IgG3, and IgG4, which are normally actively transported across to confer general passive infectious disease immunity to the fetus that will last for the first several months of life. Albumin is also actively transported via the same mechanism, to provide this protein and its amino acids to the fetus. Relatively small amounts of IgG2 cross the placenta. So Harrison&#39;s antibodies may be of the IgG2 type. More likely, perhaps, Harrison&#39;s antibodies are the pentavalent IgM type which is much too large to cross but is extra effective at &quot;mopping up&quot; any fetal red blood cells that happen to make it into the mother&#39;s blood circulation. Women who produce dangerous anti-D antibodies are making one of the IgG types that is able to cross the placenta. Most people produce IgM antibodies against the major blood group antigens A and B, but a few type O women produce IgG antibodies against the A and/or B antigen, which can cross the placenta and cause hemolysis if the fetus has the incompatible major blood group type, although these cases are usually milder than anti-D (Rh) cases, and usually don&#39;t get worse with subsequent pregnancies. To encourage the production of extra high concentrations of the anti-D (IgM) antibodies in Mr. Harrison, he is probably periodically injected with D-positive red blood cells, to maximize his immune system&#39;s response.", "comment_date": "2016-12-07T23:09:46Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Irv Bromberg", "comment_text": "Bilirubin doesn&#39;t break down red blood cells (RBCs). Rather the immune system breaks down antibody-coated RBCs, releasing the oxygen-carrying prosthetic group, heme, from hemoglobin. Heme is cut on one side, forming biliverdin, which is then reduced to bilirubin. Processing by the liver adds (conjugates) one or two carbohydrates to each bilirubin molecule (usually glucuronide) to make it more water soluble and hence non-toxic. If the hemolysis rate is too fast for the newborn to conjugate all of the bilirubin then the blood concentration of unconjugated bilirubin rises and THAT is what is toxic to the brain, mainly the basal ganglia.", "comment_date": "2016-12-07T22:57:44Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Special Agent Cake", "comment_text": "Quick question: Why don&#39;t phone screens work when our fingers are cold?", "comment_date": "2016-12-07T22:46:50Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Katharina xyl", "comment_text": "Shouldn&#39;t it be converted...INTO bilirubin...?", "comment_date": "2016-12-07T22:45:19Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "MeWho", "comment_text": "An interesting trip down memory lane.
