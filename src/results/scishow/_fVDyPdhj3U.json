Mental health professionals have trouble understanding that this anxiety is not a choice or caused by anything specific.<br><br>It could be that this is the cause of panic disorder, a neurological disorder that causes panic attacks and anxiety without the typical anxiety triggers in typical disorders. And, it would make sense for PTSD too and &quot;hypervigilance&quot; as well. Also explains why depressants/sedatives work well for people who struggle with these issues (like myself) because it limits the response of key areas of the brain responsible for threat detection and perception, giving relief from overwhelming feelings that hijack the rest of the brain and body&#39;s activity.<br><br>It is theorized that some strains of marijuana do this too, and that this helps with PTSD because it allows patients to more safely confront their triggers and program new, healthier chains of neurons associated with those things, and in turn cause the old and dysfunctional chains to deteriorate due to disuse, and creating a preference in the brain for the new chain through positive neurochemistry (ei more stable and functional levels of dopamine, serotinin, etc).<br><br>I believe we really need to laser focus research onto this new discovery and the implications with mental health, especially PTSD, which can cause symptoms commonly misdiagnosed as anxiety and depression, and the effects that different chemicals and treatments have on this area of the brain, especially substances people with PTSD feel helps with their symptoms, and what they and their doctors observe improving the results of treatment.<br><br>PTSD is a terrible illness, and the fact that there are only a few FDA approved treatments for PTSD specifically is very sad and very problematic. PTSD holds me back in about every major and minor part of my life, one way or another, and I need a better prognosis.

Also had a weird hearing impairment from the Bell&#39;s Palsy, which significantly affected my recognition of people&#39;s voices over the phone, for some considerable time. I could hear what they were saying, but didn&#39;t have a clue who they were for the first minute or so, which didn&#39;t endear me to my then employers or any subsequent employer, who always insisted that I answer the phones (good phone manners and speaking voice lol).
