Not all beer is created equal. I never was a beer drinker until I got into ale. Lager is generally too bland and boring for me, although lager can be drinkable. Ale usually has much more complex discernible flavours such as chocolate, citrus, toffee, spice, honey, liquorice etc. which go beyond the sweet bready malt, and bitter hops. I believe this is due to the warm fermentation process where the ale yeast produces aromatic esters. Some ales are oak aged which imparts another layer of interesting flavour. Make sure to check out Innis and Gunn for really great oak-aged ale.", "comment_date": "2016-08-27T22:27:35Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "JustinDL97", "comment_text": "Sci show asking the real questions.", "comment_date": "2016-08-27T22:25:29Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Kelvin Lee", "comment_text": "But why is there hair around my beer?", "comment_date": "2016-08-27T22:24:45Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "John Clavis", "comment_text": "The best way to pour beer is into my mouth.", "comment_date": "2016-08-27T22:24:28Z", "likes_count": 5}, {"comment_by": "KaptajnKaffe", "comment_text": "Depends on what beer your pouring, some beer need a head.", "comment_date": "2016-08-27T22:21:59Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "SoyGompers", "comment_text": "how do I cure a cold", "comment_date": "2016-08-27T22:21:49Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Spencer Eliot Clark", "comment_text": "Does this also work for soda?", "comment_date": "2016-08-27T22:20:50Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Toasty McDanish", "comment_text": "I&#39;m sorry Hank but it&#39;s pronounced &quot;Champ-hag-gin&quot; <br>Jeez, haven&#39;t you even seem futurama?", "comment_date": "2016-08-27T22:20:48Z", "likes_count": 2}, {"comment_by": "HappyDonkeyKong", "comment_text": "does that work for coke?", "comment_date": "2016-08-27T22:20:18Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Will lenoX", "comment_text": "someone needs to show this to Hillary Clinton.", "comment_date": "2016-08-27T22:17:28Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Mark W", "comment_text": "An old playboy article recommended against tilting when pouring beer from a bottle into a glass.
