Killing its host is not an evolutionary advantage.  If the virus kills its host too quickly then people will take it more seriously, as well as potentially more less time for the virus to spread to others while the host is alive.  Typically what you will see (and what sar-scov2 is heading towards) is something like the flu where it spreads every year, but becomes typically less deadly.  High infeciton rates, with little host impact is the goal.<br><br>What is bad is when a virus transfers to a different type of host (like a bat or monkey), changes a bunch to become successful in that group, and then comes back to humans.  When it comes back, it may still be very infectious to humans, but may be more deadly because it is now optomized for this other group.<br><br>Now, the other potentially terrible thing that we are seeing is with these new more infectious mutations.  Much more infectious, which overloads the hospitals, which then limits care, and more people die; a similar (or more likely lower) percentage of cases are dying... but so many extra cases that the over-all death count is higher.<br>Except that I am not sure that is exactly what is happening.  The R0 of a virus is based on how much the virus is spreading; not how easy a virus can spread.  We are still in the midst of reported infections which started back in Christmas and New Years... The issue we may be seeing with the rise in R0 may have a lot more to do with people letting their defences down, and being in close quarters inside, and traveling a lot instead of the virus itself being worse.  Many parts of England have given up on enforcing lock-down policies, though I am not sure about Africa.  The US has also given up on lockdowns in many areas, which is why we are seeing the numbers that we have right now.  I could absolutely be wrong in this, but I really hope I am not, and we will see things calm down a bit in the end of January and heading into feb.<br><br>I guess my encouragement is that we should be on the tail end of the holiday infections.  With people going back home, and going back to their regular routine with smaller required social circles there is a very good chance the R0 will drop substantially over the next few months... and will drop like a rock in the spring when people can more easily go outdoors again.  Hopefully most people will be vaccinated by the end of this summer, and when we hit the fall wave again (and there will be a fall wave), it will hopefully be very small and manageable much like the common flu, and with enough resources to treat people that it will hopefully not be significantly more deadly than the flu.", "comment_date": "2021-01-19T20:29:09Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Miles", "comment_text": "Ivermectin having good results......look into it....surprising!", "comment_date": "2021-01-19T17:47:25Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Herbert Fawcett", "comment_text": "Short story, this is how the liberal governors keep us in lock down.

Even though Cronavirus are considered far more stable in this regard than flu/virus, nevertheless inevitably will occur within large population infection spread.

Corna vaccines are notoriously problematic ( mostly due to rapid weakening) and have never been successful. <br><br>-- SARS-COV-2 will not/cannot be contained or eradicated. What is going on right now, is known in epidemiology as the pathogen endemic equilibrium phase, (viral stasis) and is perfectly normal. Virulence weakening and dilution is what always happens when mutations and naturally acquired herd immunity is occurring throughout the populations. Invariably mutation causes infection rate increase and lethality rate decrease, henceforth it becomes ubiquitous and permanent. Vaccination at this stage, is essentially pointless. <br><br>-- To show statistical significance for a virus of this type, a vaccine must show efficacy, (save lives, Period.) However, when the overall death rate is between 0.2 and 0.5 %, there will be little to no benefit. In other words, SARS-COV-2 virus is far too weak right now to show a vaccines effectiveness rate numerically, at population scale. <br><br>-- Ubiquitous viruses are fought and defeated primarily by the T-Cell lymphocytes within our immune systems, Not from antibodies.

However, the composition of chemtrails helps to understand the magnitude of the consequences of chemtrails and to understand why the sky becomes cloudy and takes on strange colors. Here is a basic list of the contents in tanks on board both civilian and military aircraft: \u25cf metallic aluminum [causes Alzheimer&#39;s disease and breast cancer] {in the toothpaste article, information about the waste of aluminum - sodium fluoride - which is added to tubes to destroy children&#39;s teeth \u00b0}; \u25cf aluminum oxide Al2O3 [causes neurocognitive disorders, pneumoconiosis, asthma, pharyngitis, nasal irritation, conjunctivitis]; \u25cf barium [consequences - shortness of breath, paralysis, anxiety, tremors, loss of energy, arrhythmia]; \u25cf bacilli and molds [meningitis, bacterial pneumonia, anthrax, erysipelas, endocarditis, necrotizing fasciitis (tissue necrosis), Ritter&#39;s disease, toxic shock, pyemia]; \u25cf Pseudomonas aeruginosa [wound / burn infection, lung infection, urinary tract infections, ear infections / otitis media]; \u25cf Pseudomonas Fluorescens [pneumonia, urinary tract infections, burn infections; the main cause of infections in humans, manifests itself in the lungs - cystic fibrosis]; \u25cf Bacillus Amyloliquefaciens [easily and quickly spreads with water, is a carcinogen, also affects plants and vegetables]; \u25cf streptomycetes [necrosis, pneumonia, cough, fever, other lung infections]; \u25cf enterobacteriaceae: salmonella; E. Coli; including the causative agents of bubonic plague and yersiniosis; \u25cf Enterobacter Cloacae [respiratory tract infections, urinary tract infections, bacteremia]; \u25cf Serratia Marcscens [lacrimal duct infections, conjunctivitis, endophthalmitis, keratitis, urinary tract infections, respiratory tract infections, gastrointestinal tract (GIT) infections]; \u25cf Zn (zinc), Cd (cadmium), S (sulfur) [cause cancer, cell mutation, malignant melanoma, infertility]; \u25cf human leukocytes [used in research laboratories to reshape and combine DNA]; \u25cf other bacilli and poisonous types of mold [meningitis, heart disease, gastrointestinal diseases and acute respiratory infections]; \u25cf insects of unknown etymology ... It is worth adding to the content of chemtrails: ethylene dibromide, barium and iron sulfates, mycoplasma (mentioned by European experts in the study of chemtrails); tiny nanorobots that penetrate the human body, grow in it and cause the &quot;Morgellon disease&quot; - the &quot;plague of the XXI century&quot;", "comment_date": "2021-01-17T03:58:28Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "*Starless", "comment_text": "I&#39;ll do everything  have to DO..but I am NOT taking a vaccine.", "comment_date": "2021-01-17T03:52:08Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "M5252email", "comment_text": "It is important to keep society awash in negative news.

Although it\u2019s mind-boggling how it vanishes when people stand close together holding signs, destroying businesses, homes, property, monuments, etc. Yet, standing to watch a marathon or a concert triggers its wrath.\r<br>\r<br>It is sneaky. It can spread when buying clothes at Kohl&#39;s but not at Target. It is non-alcoholic. It can&#39;t spread when you are buying beer. It lives for two days on Amazon boxes, you must wait 48 hours to touch them but It can&#39;t survive on Dunkin Donuts coffee cups, so enjoying a hot cup of joe is safe. It is the most curious thing, how it lives on basketballs, baseball bats, and ballet bars, but dies on WWE ropes and Walmart shopping carts. It is spread by hairstylists, dog groomers, and dentists, but not by bank tellers, cashiers, and fast-food workers.\r<br>\r<br>It&#39;s so smart. It won\u2019t bother the first 10 people but it knows when the 11th person shows up so be careful if that\u2019s you. It even knows what you want vs what you need. If you want a massage or your nails done it is very active on the prowl and not even a mask can stop it but If you need a plumber, it is weak, and a mask will keep it away. It also seems to be most dangerous after 5:30pm so businesses must start to close before the virus comes out and wreaks havoc upon the populations.
