Current research tells us that the endomembrane systems of eukaryotes, and in particular the nucleus with its elaborate nuclear pore complex, are not found in archaea, and seem to be derived, at least in part, from bacterial ancestral components. These findings seem to be best compatible with a symbiogenesis scenario for the origin of eukaryotes under which eukaryogenesis was triggered by the endosymbiosis of an \u03b1-proteobacterium with an ancestral archaeon, with the nucleus evolving as a defense against intron invasion. That is to say the ancestors of the eukaryotes were prokaryotes and viruses are not part of the picture. That picture, however, is far from complete.
