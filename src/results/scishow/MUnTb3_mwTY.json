Since early April, the cumulative number of infections in South Africa has doubled about every 14 days. On 12 July 2020, 264,184 cumulative cases have been recorded, slightly more than double the 131,800 on 28 June, 14 days before. South Africa was firmly on track to record half a million cumulative infections by 25 July. Community spread was  unstoppable. At that rate of increase, 1 million will have been infected by 8 August, 2 million by 22 August, 4 million by 5 September, 8 million by 19 September, 16 million by 3 October and some 32 million by 17 October 2020. That is 53% of the population of over 59 million people. The daily number of new infections should then drop off steeply. However, over the first two weeks of October, on average over a million new infections are likely to occur daily.<br>On 12 July 2020 sales of alcoholic beveridges were prohibited in South Africa. On the very next day, the number of new cases dropped significantly by about 1,500. This trend continued daily and became progressively stronger. The result was that, today 24 July, the official cumulative number of cases in South Africa stand at  408,052, instead of about 480,000. The ban on alcohol sales is no rational reason for the sudden drop, hence the indication is that the numbers are being manipulated, as are the figures on recoveries and deaths. <br>Public hospitals in South Africa have been plundered bare over the last 26 years and are unable to meet the increase in demand for sophisticated health care due to the Covid-19 crisis. The additional &#39;health budget&#39; announced some two months ago, has turned out just another opportunity for &#39;connected&#39; black business people to plunder, by loading contracted prices for protective medical equipment several hundred-fold. Even private hospitals are now being flooded by covid cases, and many people will not be able to access hospital care over the next four months. Also, the epidemic in South Africa comes on top of high incidences of tuberculosis, aids, diabetes and hypertension, all co-morbidities that significantly increase the likelihood of death \u2013 Dr Mary-Ann Davies, <a href=\"https://www.aidsmap.com/news/jun-2020/people-hiv-greater-risk-covid-19-death-south-african-study\">https://www.aidsmap.com/news/jun-2020/people-hiv-greater-risk-covid-19-death-south-african-study</a>. In addition, a high incidence of infant malnutrition and, quite likely, also substantial Vitamin D deficiencies in many South Africans with dark skin, may leave many in South Africa vulnerable to inflammatory respiratory conditions such as covid-19. Defiance, denial and unwillingness to accept the discomfort of lockdown are further exacerbating factors.<br>Early &#39;evidence&#39; of flattening of the curve in South Africa is unreliable and misleading. Exponential epidemic growth of infected numbers is now well underway, and it appears that, some eight to ten weeks ago, the authorities have quietly accepted that the epidemic will run its course essentially unchecked. Officially, the peak is expected in September. Notwithstanding acceptance that the epidemic will run its course unchecked, very harsh, albeit clearly predominantly entirely nonsensical, irrational and uselessly ineffective, lockdown measures were introduced and are being brutally enforced. Ostensibly, the purpose is window-dressing that &#39;government is doing all it can to address&#39; the crisis. Death rates are likely to be high, regardless a relatively young population. One of every two infected people over the age of 75 will most likely die, one of every four between the ages of 65 and 74, one of five between the ages of 45 and 64 and less than one of 25 younger than 44. Statistics of &#39;recoveries&#39; are evidently also hugely suspect. Clearly, many politicians are totally out of sync with epidemic events. Everything that could possibly be done wrong with regard to the social and demographic realities of South Africa, they have managed to do wrong, demonstrating inability to understand the course of an epidemic, and of the role that social and demographic conditions play in its unfolding. <br>However, far worse, still, is that the government is now trying to conceal their incompetence by beating the old Marxist drum of human suffering caused by suppression and exploitation of the black majority section of society by the privileged white minority section (See Jordan Peterson, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofmuCXRMoSA&amp;t=1498s)\">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofmuCXRMoSA&amp;t=1498s)</a>.<br>The harsh lockdown measures in South Africa is certain to drive a majority of small businesses to the wall. Countless numbers of these were started by Whites when legislated black economic empowerment since 1994 forced Whites out of jobs. Generally, these businesses have done well, a reality resented by many black South Africans with Marxist leanings. State financial assistance to weather the covid-19 crisis is not available to white-owned businesses; they are being discriminated against on a racial basis regardless the fact that they pay taxes and employ large numbers of black citizens. The epidemic is being used to selectively drive white-owned businesses out of business, even though replacement employers are not being instituted. The interests of black employees of such businesses are simply being ignored. This is most deplorable, cowardly racism against an ethnic minority and will result in greater famine, hardship and poverty among ordinary people \u2013 both white and black - already impoverished by the ongoing plundering of state assets, especially during the Zuma era. The outside world must take notice. <br>Expatriate South Africans and others worldwide need to do whatever they can to help white-owned small businesses in South Africa survive the crisis and the racist campaign against them. Please look through the causes listed at <a href=\"https://www.backabuddy.co.za/news/covid-19-campaign-updates/\">https://www.backabuddy.co.za/news/covid-19-campaign-updates/</a> and donate to a business of your choice. Help preserve the lives and livelihoods of countless numbers of both Blacks and Whites in South Africa. The likes of Malema, Dlamini Zuma, Magashule and many others care only for power and the opportunity it affords them to plunder state assets at the cost of the poor. <br>Community spread is now unstoppable. No amount of lockdown will have any effect whatsoever. It is up to every individual family unit to protect themselves as best they can. Fortunately, with a little self discipline, this can be readily achieved. Family isolation, social distancing, washing of hands and of surfaces outsiders might have contaminated with small drops of saliva, and the wearing of a mask whenever within 6 meters from outsiders, are the measures that should be rigorously applied for the next three to four months. These measures allow individuals to still go outside for walks or a run. These simple measures are 100% effective and many lives can be saved. The broad community in South Africa should also prepare to care for covid cases at home. Useful guidelines are here:  <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/groups/264551353898881/permalink/1312797889074217/\">https://www.facebook.com/groups/264551353898881/permalink/1312797889074217/</a><br>The upshot of this chain of past and prospective future events is that, by mid-October 2020, South Africa could be one of the very first countries in the world where the population has developed true herd immunity. By November, the epidemic in South Africa should be all over. South Africa can then enjoy their enviable position for a few months until vaccines become available. But the next 3 to 4 months will bring unspeakable suffering and tragedy to the people of South Africa.", "comment_date": "2020-07-23T23:32:37Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Dimitriou Chemistry", "comment_text": "Why do you scream as soon as the video starts", "comment_date": "2020-07-23T02:10:26Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Pierre Villemaire-Brooks", "comment_text": "I&#39;m having a lot of concerns about the short and long term side effects of using such methods to ward off this covid19 disease.
