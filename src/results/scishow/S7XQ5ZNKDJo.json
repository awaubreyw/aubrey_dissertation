We had road side pick up each time and the persons always had masks and clean pair of gloves on. We all stayed 6 ft apart so they had to load it in trunk while I stayed in car. I caught covid from the 1st few vaccinated in our town while They and I had masks on 6 ft apart. I was dizzy with vertigo for 4 days then a week of no smell no taste. I also was diagnosed aT at E. R.

Of course, the typical knee-jerk conspiracy is &quot;everything is just COVID now&quot;. But that&#39;s not true at all. In fact, heart disease and cancer were still number 1 and 2 in causes of death by a significant number (cancer was basically the same as in 2019 and heart disease saw its biggest jump in years). Ditto Alzheimers, diabetes, stroke etc. All similar but increased versus 2019.<br><br>But influenza really did go away, starting in March 2020. We were still testing for it, it&#39;s just that nobody was positive anymore. Test positivity was 0.2% during peak season in 2020/2021. That number is probably meaningless for most, but I can tell you that test positivity typically exceeds 20% during peak season. So essentially any given flu specimen was 100x more likely to test positive in 2019/2020 than in 2020/2021.<br><br>So why did flu disappear but not covid? I think it mostly boils down to the inherent infectiousness of each virus. For starters, the R0 of influenza is only 1.3 during peak season, compared to ~2.5-3 for OG covid and 5-8 for delta. This means that every person with influenza transmits it to 1.3 other people, on average, while the average person with COVID transmits it to at least twice as many people. Any R0 &gt;1 = a growing number of cases and any R0 &lt;1 = a declining number of cases. It&#39;s not very hard to conceive how you could implement measures which would drive influenza&#39;s R0 to less than 1 (meaning it goes away) while COVID&#39;s would stay above 1 (meaning it keeps proliferating, but less than it would without any measures at all). Let&#39;s say that masks reduced R0 of influenza and COVID by 0.5 each. That would drop flu&#39;s R0 to 0.8 (starts to disappear) while COVID&#39;s would still be 2+ (keeps growing).<br><br>And then there&#39;s the fact that they&#39;re different viruses and may spread differently. Influenza spreads through mostly large, heavy droplets. There is some evidence that COVID might be more prone to travel through smaller droplet nuclei. If that&#39;s the case, then the particles could stay suspended in the air longer and travel farther (so something like 6ft might work great for influenza, but not so well for COVID). It could also mean that masks are more effective for flu than influenza.<br><br>Lastly, there&#39;s population immunity to consider. Almost everyone in the world has been exposed to influenza, meaning there is some level of immunity that is likely always slowing the spread somewhat. SARS-COV-2, on the other hand, is a novel virus. In early 2020, there was essentially 0% population immunity and only 20-30% by then end of 2020 (in the US). Even today that number is probably under 80%, despite vaccination and over a hundred million infections.

Influenza is so much less transmissible, that in case a bad flu season happens, some light mask wearing and keeping the sick at home, can easily snuff it out. And in the extreme case, if nothing else works, a week of social distancing should keep it at bay, after all the extreme measures against something so much more contagious, it should be a walk in the park.
