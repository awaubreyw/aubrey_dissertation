And after some time those thoughts naturally stop coming and slowly we fall asleep. Now suppose that we&#39;ve just used our phone  and now we are trying to sleep. Naturally some thoughts related to our phone will come to our mind and if we sleep with our phone just on the other side of the bed, there are high chances that we will pick it up again. We tend to do this repeatedly and we don&#39;t realize that a lot of time has already passed and in this way our sleep pattern slowly starts disrupting. I can tell this with confidence because I&#39;ve experienced all of this myself.
