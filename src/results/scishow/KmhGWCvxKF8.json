This is unfortunate because, stripped of these connotations, it rather nicely captures the way most physicists actually think about the vacuum. . . . Relativity actually says nothing about the existence or nonexistence of matter pervading the universe, only that any such matter must have relativistic symmetry. [..] It turns out that such matter exists. About the time relativity was becoming accepted, studies of radioactivity began showing that the empty vacuum of space had spectroscopic structure similar to that of ordinary quantum solids and fluids. Subsequent studies with large particle accelerators have now led us to understand that space is more like a piece of window glass than ideal Newtonian emptiness. It is filled with &#39;stuff&#39; that is normally transparent but can be made visible by hitting it sufficiently hard to knock out a part. The modern concept of the vacuum of space, confirmed every day by experiment, is a relativistic ether.

You could describe the structure of molecules in only a few more bits than there are atoms in the molecule, probably plus a few to describe folding the molecule which could also be described as a knot in itself!

Geometrization together with the JSJ decomposition in-principle is not only a solution, but a beautiful solution.  Much of it has been implemented on computer and the algorithms are highly effective provided your knot does not have an insane number of crossings (like, say, over 100).  Most of the algorithms are implemented in the software packages Regina and Snappea.  The former was created by Ben Burton, the latter by Jeff Weeks, although there have been many contributors to both.
