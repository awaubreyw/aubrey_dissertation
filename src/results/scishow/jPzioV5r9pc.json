Repurposing of medications in this manner is a growing trend.  There are multiple reasons for this.  For one a drug that is already FDA approved need not be retested for safety only for efficacy.  There is no need to design new manufacturing techniques or equipment.  And brand recognition can go a long way to the public&#39;s acceptance of the newly repurposed medication.  Take for instance how quickly aspirin was accepted as a means to helping to lower the risk of heart attack.  Also commonly used medications have strong track records of not manifesting rare but deadly side effects that only show up once the drug is in wide distribution.<br><br>I my case the addition of Plaquenil to my daily regimen has both lowered the occurrence rate of blood clots but has also served as a substance that has greatly reduced my migraine frequency and severity.
