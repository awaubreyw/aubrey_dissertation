I mean, if life spontaneously arises from natural chemical processes, why did that only happen once? Why aren\u2019t there more than one Tree of Lifes? We could imagine a planet where life developed many times, independently. <br><br>I\u2019m just confused why it only happened once here: does existing life \u2018eat\u2019 or break up other chemical reactions because they get a chance to develop into new life forms? That would explain it. <br><br>Another idea is that the spontaneous moment where non-living chemical processes become a living thing is so so so so super duper rare that it is exponentially more likely to occur N times than (N+1), which would imply that planets with life are most likely to have only one Tree of Life (it would also imply that the vast majority of warm, moist, volcanic, life-friendly planets do not in fact have life, just because it never happened to get started).", "comment_date": "2020-04-10T05:34:40Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "18 ducks in a trenchcoat", "comment_text": "\ud83d\ude12 bong<br><br>\ud83d\ude0f <b>white smokers</b>", "comment_date": "2020-04-10T05:31:09Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Deepanshu Joshi", "comment_text": "Why is the video and comments section so close \ud83d\ude44\ud83d\ude44", "comment_date": "2020-04-10T05:29:45Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Deepanshu Joshi", "comment_text": "Why is the video and comments section so close \ud83d\ude44\ud83d\ude44", "comment_date": "2020-04-10T05:29:42Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Andrew Van Lare", "comment_text": "I came to the comments for one reason...<br><br><br><br><br>I was not disappointed \ud83d\ude02", "comment_date": "2020-04-10T05:03:31Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Companerger", "comment_text": "Great ep!", "comment_date": "2020-04-10T04:47:09Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Avery the Cuban-American", "comment_text": "Atlantis?
