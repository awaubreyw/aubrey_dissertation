For every milliliter of ethanol-containing beverage ingested, drink an equal amount of mL of regular water, e.g. after drinking one 355 mL beer, follow it with 355 mL of water.<br>2. Do not over-compensate with regular water, e.g. do not drink more than about 750 mL of water per one hour, or else you risk hyponatremia/water-intoxication (which can kill anyone). <br>3. Do not consume more than one ethanol-containing beverage per one hour, e.g. do not consume more than 45 mL of 40% ABV liquor, or 355 mL of 5% beer, or 150 mL of 12% wine, per hour.<br>4. Eat a healthy, nutritious, vegetable-containing, fiber-rich, protein-rich, filling meal 30 to 60 minutes prior to ingesting your first ethanol-containing beverage.<br>5. Eat a small, healthy snack once every two to three hours during the period of time that you are consuming ethanol-containing beverages.<br>6. Do not wait to urinate, i.e. do not &#39;hold it in&#39;, and after urinating try to ingest a small amount non-alcoholic, but electrolyte-rich fluid, such as 100% pure unsweetened carrot juice.<br>7. Do not take mega-doses of vitamins or minerals before, during, or after your period of ethanol consumption.<br>8. One of the only hepatoprotective (liver-protecting) herbal supplements that has a scientifically-verified helpful effect for ethanol-consumers is Milk Thistle extract (Silybum marianum), evidence shows that it may provide beneficial protective effects on the human liver when consumed in recommended dosages before or after heavy ethanol ingestion. However, it is not a cure or magic pill, and it won&#39;t guarantee that you won&#39;t develop liver, kidney, cardiovascular, gastrointestinal, or neurological diseases from prolonged heavy ethanol consumption, it may only help a little bit.<br>9. Organic ginger root (Zingiber officinale) in tisane (herbal tea) form may reduce symptoms of a hangover (especially nausea) after a night of drinking, as it has anti-inflammatory, anti-emetic, and antioxidant effects in humans. Scientific evidence for these effects in humans is moderate but, as with Milk Thistle extract, more research is needed to discover the full mechanisms of action.<br>10. If you consume &quot;hard alcohol&quot;, a.k.a. 80-proof (40% ABV) liquor/spirits, make sure to choose some form of vodka (there are wheat-based and potato-based vodkas), if you are in the U.S.A., then anything sold as &quot;vodka&quot; is strictly regulated to contain nothing else but 40% ethanol and 60% water plus tiny fractions of trace fermentation/distillation byproducts. The darker your liquor, the more manufacturing byproducts there are within it, some of which can be more harmful than ethanol itself (e.g. methanol and other carcinogenic toxins).<br>11. If you travel while under the influence of ethanol, never ever drive a motor vehicle, bicycle, or anything else you can operate that accelerates your body to high speeds. Always arrange for a sober friend or trusted driver to transport you and everyone else with you who have consumed ethanol or plan to that day.<br>12. Purchase a high-quality &quot;breathalyzer&quot; (breath-analyzer) device and use it on yourself and your friends if you want a decently reliable way to measure your current blood alcohol concentration (BAC), it may be helpful for judging whether or not your driver is safe to operate a vehicle, and can provide you with information to help you better judge whether or not you should continue ingesting ethanol. It may also be helpful for preventing ethanol-poisoning by providing forewarning of elevated BAC.<br><br><br>Be safe, everyone!", "comment_date": "2020-01-09T02:34:32Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Adam Wishneusky", "comment_text": "WATERRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRR", "comment_date": "2020-01-06T06:17:18Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Kenny Houghton", "comment_text": "the last guy and every one else whos going to leave a comment after me is right...
