Whats worse, risking some weather modification or suffering the consequences of climate change, If it hasnt hit you yet you probaly dont care. There is a gentler solution, We can put dust into  high altitude like 45,000 feet.  We can use the natural   models of volcanic eruptions and forest fires to predict some what the outcome. By using dust, something that exist in traffic and nature, Its a low-risk venture, Using lime dust the lime acts like an anti-acid and remedies acid rain and acid water. I suggest we dont do the whole planet but regions where it is hotter then comfortable like over 90\u00b0. Savings from air-conditioning can pay for the project. Wouldn&#39;t you like cooler weather? A byproduct of the action would be long term global temperature mitigation. I would say try it and see with one aircraft; we can use the 747 used for dumping fire retardant on wild fires. Put a dust cloud at say 5,000 feet then measure the sunlight loss. Lots of sunlight up there so all we have to do is reflect like 2 to 5 % of the sky to lower temperature 10\u00b0 or 20\u00b0. This is different than making rain because the only consequence is cooling. It is manageable because if it gets too cool, we stop, the dust will fall out after a few years. Long term i would say 10 aircraft on the west coast, approaching 50,000 ft, could drop dust that would shade the southern USA. Like air-conditioning, once you try it you wont stop.

Variance of 10 degrees away from predictions over just 20 year periods were the norm  That&#39;s because the basic variables like the underwater ocean currents, drought severity, strength of solar radiation and others are not measured or modeled with much predictive quality. 6 years ago Nasa researchers modeled climate with what they called a double dynamo model of solar radiation. That predicted a predictable change in radiation that is 90% more predictive than previous models. The predictive quality is confirmed by comparison of tree ring growth, and arctic ice core samples to predicted values. Applying this model to climate change has been predictive of climate change 10% away from actual over 1500 years.

Agricultural production per ha in most places will continue to increase for decades at least, as it has been doing for decades, due to on average, slightly higher rainfall in many places and also higher fertilisation from higher C02. Note according to the IPCC, there has been no trend in droughts on average to date, nor any trend on storminess or frequency of hurricanes, (but possibly a trend in more strength of hurricanes). Lives lost from deaths from the cold will likely also decrease (not mentioned in the above). More &#39;greening of the earth&#39;, will also continue, as it has for decades, largely due to fertilisation from higher C02. The Sahara is likely to shrink, as it did during warmer parts of the Holocene. The point is, there are both positives and negatives, and one report by the IPCC estimates the negatives will start to outweigh the positives by around 2080. Also note, that since we are technically within an Ice Age since around 4 million years ago (with the average temperature of the earth before the industrial revolution actually relatively low on broader time scales, which was never really taken into account when the 2 degree C figure was estimated-the people who made this estimate are not glaciologists, mostly mathematicians, biologists, and modellers), this 2 degrees C figure might be too restrictive; the earth has had long periods of higher average temperatures where life has flourished. The point at which things get more unquestionably negative overall might be a little higher than 2 degrees C, giving more time.

The IPCC &quot;numbers&quot; and predictions of just 2 years ago are all wrong. All the data from 2019 and more recently--on all the forcing factors of all the interacting feedback loops and warming and melting--show all the increases accelerating, since 2007.<br>&gt;<br>We&#39;ll be lucky to keep average temperature increase down to 2*C by 2050. Indeed, if the meltdown and sea-level increases keep accelerating beyond last year&#39;s rates, average sea-level will be 10 to 20 meters higher by 2035, not 20 to 30 centimeters higher. In fact, if we don&#39;t start a massive global emergency response ASAP (or now), the planet could be ice-free by 2072, with average sea-level 70 meters higher.<br>&gt;<br>The data, many studies and analyses since 2018 show that average temperature could be 4.5*C hotter by 2090, unless we do some radical global changes to slow the warming as much as possible as fast as possible. Even 2*C hotter will cause mass-extinctions of plants and animals that cannot adapt so fast.<br>&gt;<br>Yet, the dire predictions about our dystopian &#39;hot-age&#39; doomdays scenario all depend on the notion that we cannot cooperate to change our ways and our infrastructure enough, soon enough. That&#39;s ridiculous. For example, with less than 90 million workers, in less than 3 years the USA became the world&#39;s first super-industrial super-power with technologies available in 1941. So, places like Vancouver BC, Kolkata, Amsterdam, Miami, NYC, etc., could be replaced by gigantic, self-propelled floating islands.<br>&gt;<br>Of course, if we really are too collectively stupid, we will fail to move about 120 nuke-power reactors &amp; fuel &amp; waste before it&#39;s too late (and they all explode &amp; meltdown &amp; poison the biosphere for a million years or so). Also, don&#39;t forget that CO2 level is already 417+ ppm, more than when Antarctica was ice-free, over a million years ago. Also, C4H and N2O levels are accelerating as submarine ice &amp; permafrost thaw. C4H is 80x more potent than CO2 after 20 years, then 25x worse at 100 years. N20 is 298x more potent. BTW, Siberian permafrost melt is now as bad as was previously predicted for the year 2100.<br>&gt;<br>SciShow should study some real science, ASAP.

One, we rarely get snow. Maybe once or twice a year. The snow we get is on the mountains, which is where we get our water supply. Secondly, our summers aren\u2019t just \u201ckind of\u201d dry. They are often quite dry. I recall numerous summers where it only rained once or twice during July and August. And one of the big problems with a rise in temperature is that Vancouver is getting drier. Which means less water. We have water restrictions nearly every summer now. And that will only get worse.<br><br>The other problem not mentioned is the rise in temperature has already brought more wild fires in BC and around Vancouver.

Just a reminder, while 2\u00b0C may not sound like a lot. When Earth was 2\u00b0C to 4\u00b0C cooler 20,000 years ago, most of North America was covered in ice several hundred feet thick. So 2\u00b0C warmer expect big impacts. Remember it\u2019s the global Climate. So big impacts. Also at the current rate of warming which is 0.2\u00b0 to 0.4\u00b0 per decade, we will reach 2\u00b0 by 2050 at the earliest. We\u2019re also seeing extreme impacts due to global warming from 1.1\u00b0C warming, so image 2\u00b0C warming, or 3\u00b0, or 4\u00b0, or even 5\u00b0C by the end of this century and beyond. Human Civilization will struggle. More extreme weather, floods, droughts, heat waves and more. Global Warming is a big problem, while we could possibly adapt to it, why make it harder on ourselves?

I&#39;m 43yrs old and I remember on Christmas day when I was 5 or 6 years old. First off you have to understand that I live in South Louisiana. I remember not being able to go outside and play with my toys that Santa brought me the night before. Even on Halloween I had to go trick or treating with a long sleeve shirt and thick jacket. The summers were awesome and played outside all the time. Now it did get hot and I mean HOT. But this was always to be expected in August. In 1987 it snowed and I was so excited. This was the first time I had ever seen snow. It was about half an inch and it shut down the city. Schools were closed and that meant more time to work on my snowman. Lol.  I tried to explain to my kids about snow. Well in 2009 the year the New Orleans Saints won the Superbowl. Hell had frozen over. We got 9 inches of snow and I couldn&#39;t believe it. Matter of fact, it snowed another time that was just as impressive. Now in the last 10 years. We only really have maybe 2 weeks of cold weather where it would get down to freezing. Our summers have been so hot and humid that my old tail can&#39;t go outside for more than a couple of hours before being drained of all energy. Every year it has been getting hotter and hotter and our winter&#39;s are getting shorter. Just this month I saw records falling left and right for a week. In late April into Early May, it has been a little chilly. Anyway, now I am a believer and I&#39;m not sure that we can reverse this at all. I have heard a ton of different ideas and some even sound like they would work. But it would kill the big time oil companies and they can&#39;t have that happen. Have good one everyone.
