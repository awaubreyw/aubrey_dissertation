I was below 15 years old back then but I do feel stiffness in my fingers. It&#39;s not painful but it&#39;s stiff and wont move easily and if I try to straighten my fingers, the last joints would have a weird curve to them. So, long story short, I carefully captured one bee and let it sting me without even thinking it could potentially kill me, I was 15 and alone in the house. It hurts a lot but few days later I can feel the effect already. My fingers stiffness were gone and there&#39;s hardly any curve now.
