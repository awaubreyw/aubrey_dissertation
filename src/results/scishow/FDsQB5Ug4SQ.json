Individual human beings are utterly unpredictable.  It is best to never try.  On aggregate, however, a group of human beings is fundamentally different from the individuals that make it up, and they are very predictable.  This distinction is very, very, very important.  This is why you can predict whether there will be crime tomorrow, but NOT whether person X will commit a crime tomorrow.  Individual human actions are very largely influenced by an infinite number of random variables.  If Mohammed Atta got a bad burrito from a cart on September 8th, 2001, there might not have been a terrorist attack on 9/11.  There might never have been one at all.  Even if you were Atta himself, you could say what you wanted to do, but you wouldn&#39;t have a great success rate if you tried to predict your own actions ahead of time.  Far too many things can intervene.<br><br>And that&#39;s not even getting started on the idea of predicting &#39;black swan&#39; events with statistics which is just fundamentally not something you can do.  This is important because people use statistics to influence you, and because some other people want your permission to do things in your name based on predictive models (if you live in the US... what do you think the NSA does with all that data?

Since every occurrence is equally likely and/or unlikely to take place for any given systemic model, this indicates that all such happenstance(s) must exist simultaneously until observation.  Being that the act of observation collapses this wave function, the underlying causality would be the conscious interpretation of relativistic space-time.  In this way, the underlying motivating factor of the universe could be described as consciousness itself.<br>Related to this notion is the concept of the infinite.  For instance, it can be said that before the big bang and inflation, time itself did not exist.  This is the same as saying that &quot;time&quot; was infinite because our relative definition of space-time is derived from causal observation and without relativistic space-time (and thereby causality) there would exist no scale with which to measure differentiation.  On an infinite scale, there is no differentiation either, since all things must come to pass - that being the characteristic of &quot;in&quot;finite.  So, before the big bang, the universe was without form and void, thus infinite but that being the case, the infinite could not have had a beginning nor end which leads to the conclusion that the true nature and state of the universe did not change, only that it became consciously observed, which is why we lay claim to the &quot;observable universe&quot;.<br>A similar logical conclusion can be arrived at upon examining Zeno&#39;s paradox.  Through the use of infinitesimals we can show that no motion can ever actually take place.  If instead, we assume that there are no local points in space-time (and thereby individual particles), then the paradox solves itself because it is immediately clear that everything can be describe as existing in a single point.  You don&#39;t actually move, you are already there because there are no separate particles.  It is then a simple matter to realize that every &quot;thing&quot; is merely a part of the whole of the universe itself, rather than separated.  Going back to the idea that conscious observation is required for causality and that the observable universe is a continuation of the infinite reality, it then seems apparent that there is an infinite consciousness of which we are merely parts, akin to cells of our body.", "comment_date": "2017-05-30T13:43:48Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Marc Redgate", "comment_text": "Great concept, unfortunately poorly presented with long shot on cards, hard to see, hard to follow.", "comment_date": "2017-05-30T10:31:15Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Sage", "comment_text": "<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FDsQB5Ug4SQ&amp;t=27m20s\">27:20</a> I was just thinking of that!", "comment_date": "2017-05-30T09:34:19Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Bec11mort", "comment_text": "Love the physics guy, hate the awkwardness...", "comment_date": "2017-05-30T02:06:42Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Amir Abudubai", "comment_text": "That was one long minute", "comment_date": "2017-05-29T23:18:19Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "darkracer86", "comment_text": "So can religious people now claim that god exists because quantum mechanics and then shrug it off?", "comment_date": "2017-05-29T18:22:27Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "See Jian Shin", "comment_text": "is this where Henry went to<br>tell him to make more minute physics video pls pls pls", "comment_date": "2017-05-29T10:20:14Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Zetadroid", "comment_text": "Dear Hank, mumbling a random sequence of words that you heard in the context of quantum mechanics is not an explanation for any interesting quantum mechanical phenomenon.", "comment_date": "2017-05-29T06:32:46Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "jank330", "comment_text": "axiom - there are lies, damn lies, and statistics", "comment_date": "2017-05-28T16:25:36Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Paran0idPanda", "comment_text": "RIP coffee table", "comment_date": "2017-05-28T15:40:25Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Sarah Kuzell", "comment_text": "So they walk like ballerina...

It&#39;s more like sleight of hand. The truly &quot;weird&quot; things come from more probabilistic things, such as the St. Petersburg Paradox.<br><br>The causal thing near the beginning also irked me. Saying that the distribution &quot;causes&quot; an event or proc is a naive interpretation. That would be like saying the distribution of temperature across the globe causes hot air. No, it <i>describes</i> hot air distribution across a landmass. The fact that the surface of the Earth is not uniformly the same in temperature does not causes the non-uniformity in temperature. Likewise, the fact that the base rates of the subpopulations of applicants are not uniform across subjects does not <i>cause</i> a different output.<br><br>I&#39;d like to coin the term &quot;influence&quot; in a paper if I ever get published because while the fact that the earth is non uniform in temperature does not cause the various kinds of temperatures, if I or another thing were to impose a change on the distribution, a change in temperature in areas would occur and we would reasonable call that a causation: I caused a change in temperature.<br><br>&quot;Causation&quot; is a philosophical subject that really shouldn&#39;t be touched by statisticians except in the strictest of mathematical sense. &quot;Influence&quot; just means &quot;if I change X, Y will change&quot; as opposed to the weaker &#39;correlation&#39; which is just observing intersections of variation in a glorified Venn diagram.", "comment_date": "2017-05-24T21:52:22Z", "likes_count": 3}, {"comment_by": "Dan P", "comment_text": "&quot;It works because it&#39;s quantum mechanics!&quot;", "comment_date": "2017-05-24T21:51:00Z", "likes_count": 8}, {"comment_by": "Haseeb", "comment_text": "men and women? what about non-cis trigender zer trans fairy kin?? <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23triggered\">#triggered</a>", "comment_date": "2017-05-24T21:50:09Z", "likes_count": 15}, {"comment_by": "Klaus Schwab\u2019s hubris.", "comment_text": "Life is like a snow storm, every flake is a possible reality that could be, i like it.", "comment_date": "2017-05-24T21:49:05Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Brian Matthews", "comment_text": "One of the best Talk Shows", "comment_date": "2017-05-24T21:45:11Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Noe Dom", "comment_text": "Rick y Morty be Like", "comment_date": "2017-05-24T21:45:00Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Edwimo", "comment_text": "<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FDsQB5Ug4SQ&amp;t=7m41s\">7:41</a> I have a different theory <br>The girls on the right have 2/4 chances to get accepted 2/4=1/2<br>The girls on the left have 1/3 chances to get accepted<br>When u add those cards together it gives 2/5 chances<br>The boys on the right have 1/2 chances of....<br>The boys on the right have 2/6=1/3 chances of being accepted<br>By adding those u get 2/5 also<br>Girl cards=Boy cards<br>2/5=2/5", "comment_date": "2017-05-24T21:43:54Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Tomasz Miku\u015b", "comment_text": "16 dislikes - incredible!

Small sample size, poor sample selection, introduction of third variables, etc etc. I think it&#39;s important for people to not just read the stat, but read how it was found to determine the limitations of it.
