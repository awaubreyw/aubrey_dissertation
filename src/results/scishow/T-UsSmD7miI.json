This condensed about 6 hrs of research I have been doing trying to figure out some major pains my doctor, surgeon, physical therapist, chiropractor, massage therapist kept calling pinched nerves! I have suffered for 12 yrs.. it&#39;s been chronic for 16 months. I go to the spine institute in Charleston Tuesday. Now I am considering cancelling it because I have been polishing, massaging with butter knife handle.. spoons.. foam cylinders and have found so much relief! I had primarily {and all the specialist} on my core and up. I started at the bottom of my feet. Dang they were tight! And I have worn yoga toes stretchers off n on for 12 years because bad feet run in my mom&#39;s family. Mine doesn&#39;t hurt, I just use the spacers as preventative purposes. When I got to my legs . Holy moly the upper back of them and my butt cheeks were way too tight but I have been doing pretty good at loosening them. But it&#39;s taken so much time reading and watching videos {I have shared this one with my mom and sisters because it&#39;s so condensed and hits all the important points. It&#39;s made them think I am less crazy or just grasping for anything to help!} I plan on learning everything I can about it because not only is it improving my pain level but it&#39;s just amazing! I can&#39;t believe they didn&#39;t study the &#39;filler&#39; 75 yrs ago! Tossing aside the very key to so many people&#39;s discomfort and pain! Thank you for sharing this! I subscribed. I hope to learn more. Hope you have more videos like this without trying to sell me something bawhahaha. Because I studied to be a paralegal before www lmbo.

This connective tissue network connects into every major system in the human body and its purpose is to relay sensory information and instruction sets throughout the multiple layers of tissue matrices, connecting internal and outer circuitry into the multidimensional spiritual layers. It is the Fascia Crystalline Network that saturates our cells with multidimensional light and sound, acting as the most important energetic communication system in our physical body. Specifically, the fascial liquid crystalline network connects directly with all of the horizontal triad bodies that make up the entire Radial Body system, and the main 12 meridians that intersect with the 12 axiatonal lines, which further communicate and send messaging into the brain and throughout the nervous system.\r<br>\r<br>Most are unaware that the extensive connective tissue of the fascia network is the manifestation of the pre-matter instruction set of tissue capsules and complex crystalline webbing that make up the multidimensional identity spheres energetic structure of the Radial Body.\r<br>\r<br>When the crystalline matrix is properly hydrated in the human body, the entire living system is bound within the water molecules and becomes electrified, transmitting energy signals at much faster speeds than the central nervous system.  Thus, the fascia network becomes a semiconductor that is conductive to electromagnetism, sparking protons and electrons to help create ions which are intrinsic to the biological ionization process of ascension that generates plasmic light. The biological ionization process is what builds and strengthens the lightbody, preparing the inner dwelling of our consciousness bodies to receive and embody liquid plasmic light.\r<br>\r<br>By understanding the piezoelectric effects of the fascial network, life force energy can be circulated to move through blockages in the meridian system and further support biological ionization. Additionally, the fascia network receives the energetic pulses we receive from the Cosmic Order that has been filtered down as energy transmissions made into the layers of the Radial body, which are then further filtered down to be transmitted into the horizontal triad bodies or dimensionalized shields. The fascia network acts as the capacitor needed to absorb the energetic current when our biology is being subjected to the added exposures of electromagnetic surges and intergalactic plasmas that are currently transmitting during the planetary ascension.  It modulates the down stepping of frequency activation in the ways that our physical body can handle or survive, so that we don\u2019t blow our circuits.\r<br>\r<br>Fascia is intelligently designed to integrate all component parts of the human body into a holistic living matrix, it is the primary organ system that is designed to unify all bodily systems in order to synthesize physical functions into achieving energetic balance or homeostasis. When there is an impact made to one smaller section of the fascia, it communicates throughout all of the interconnected structures, thus, the entire living system of the body is affected.\r<br>\r<br>The Fascia crystalline network acts as the transport messenger of intelligent information, such as that made from encountering stimulus from the outer world by communicating that data to the inner energetic landscape of the entire human body.  The information that is collected from the environmental conditions are sent back into the cells of the human body in order to determine what genes are being transcribed within the cell and what instruction sets are needed for an assortment of functions to optimize the bodily systems. As an example, the cells in the body produce metabolic waste products that require detoxification, and the fascia network delivers the information needed in the cell to cell network to help facilitate the cellular detoxification process and then help to deliver nutrients to where they are most needed.  The fascia network performs the same function for releasing and clearing the energetic equivalents of toxins, such as implants, AI signals and energy parasites, which includes the realms of negative entity attachments and alien hybridization overlays. These classifications are considered energetic contaminants that require detoxification from the organic crystalline body and consciousness, which have negative impacts similar to unreleased metabolic waste that become toxic.\r<br>\r<br>Source: energeticsynthesis. com/ index.php/ resource-tools/ news-shift-timelines/ 3533-fascia-crystalline-network\r<br><a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23fascia\">#fascia</a> <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23network\">#network</a> <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23matrix\">#matrix</a> <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23DNA\">#DNA</a>", "comment_date": "2019-12-15T16:55:06Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Tash west", "comment_text": "Fascianating ;)", "comment_date": "2019-12-01T01:52:46Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Seanidor", "comment_text": "Sounds like it&#39;s time to become a... fascianista!", "comment_date": "2019-11-27T01:16:54Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "John Smith", "comment_text": "Wow fascia are so cool and under appreciated, I&#39;m gonna make a shirt to show off my love for them: &quot;I&#39;M A FASCIST!!! :)&quot;", "comment_date": "2019-11-12T15:15:53Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "laurence robert tampus halpin", "comment_text": "Fascia in phl is decision", "comment_date": "2019-11-10T02:18:34Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "PMDD-and-Me Life Support", "comment_text": "Fascia-nating!", "comment_date": "2019-10-27T15:17:55Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Nausheen Khan", "comment_text": "Too fast", "comment_date": "2019-09-30T15:43:47Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "AverageJoe8686", "comment_text": "O N L Y N O T H I N G I S N O T H I N G", "comment_date": "2019-09-26T23:46:00Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Rocio Gomez", "comment_text": "Pinche copia de Hank Green :( solo que mas guapo pero que sad que su estilo de explicar las cosas se parezca.

The triad of conditions; EDS., mast cell activation syndrome, and postural orthostatic hypotension together affect the entire body. I have always intuitively understood that the problems I have physically are only the measurable parts of my conditions and that there are hormonal and chemical problems lurking under the surface. Since those things are difficult to measure or test, maybe testing the fascia could provide more evidence and suggest possible treatments.  The source of these is a mutation on the MTHFR gene.
