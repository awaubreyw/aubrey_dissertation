By using beams built up to balance the rock, it was like seesawing the rock up the height it needed to go. Kind of like a giant game of Jenga. Levers all the way up!<br>Another television show I saw a long time ago showed a group of people who used an obelisk such as the Ancient Egyptians created who set up the heavy obelisk by creating a hole for the obelisk to be placed in, and one side was graded at a diagonal so it could be dragged down by rope tackle to the placement point. Then the group used the tackle to set the stone upright into its resting hole. I&#39;m not sure, but it might have been that upright wedges were used to keep the obelisk in place while the incline was filled up.<br><br>Indeed!

I know what is built at both sites and will very briefly say what that is here. Stonehenge is a type of memory device, a silicon sarsen hard drive and solar powered computer that contains the accumulated knowledge of the lost civilisation in its pure original form. Its a representation of high genius, far in advance of our understanding of today. Its not a question of what science can teach us about Stonehenge it&#39;s far more about what Stonehenge can teach us about the nature of reality. But because of the truths it holds arrogant men prefer to live a collective lie of &quot;truth&quot; imposed from above that is not conducive to the wellbeing of the planet or its many inhabitants. Monmouth was correct in much he wrote about Stonehenge, the original idea the evidence strongly suggests may very well have come from Africa as Stonehenge and the Great Pyramid are so closley linked they can be considered to be part of the same machine. A machine for what? Egyptologists agree &quot;The Great pyramid is a type of resurrection machine&quot; , but a machine not just capable of bringing the dead king back to life together with his sincere followers but also capable of bringing the entire body of the philosophy  and science that was used to build it. Scholars agree Merlin had one primary role in folklaw and that was to instigate the conception and birth of Arthur, &quot;The once and future king&quot;  and when properly understood Stonehenge on one of its multiply layers of meaning can be conclusivly shown to be the conception and birth temple of Arthur and according to Monmouth was built by Merlin.Merlins real role in instigating the conception and birth of Arthur wasnt for his past life it was for his future life when he returns to again be King and instigate the new age of humankind and Merlin did this by building Stonehenge, perhaps when properly understood the greatest scientific device ever built. Because it is a scientific device, designed as a working instrument, it becomes aparent its builders really did manage to send a man through time and have him scientifically identifiable. &quot;In those days the stones shall speak&quot; is one of the prophecies of Merlin written in Monmouths book &quot;The Prophecies of Merlin&quot; and most of these prophecies  are nonsense but this one stands out and seems it could easiily be refering to Stonehenge as today the sacred stones are speaking in the universal language of number and science for all to hear, yet this message from a lost ancient scientific and spiritual civilisation is universaly ignored by cowardly men not a single one of whome would dare sit down with me and discuss what was built at these places. &quot;Truth above all&quot; was according to the Christian monk Monmouth Merlins greatest virtue and the truth will be told on my Youtube channel should anyone be interested. My channel is a work in progress with its best videos yet come, but these videos will be made as time allows and full explanation given as to what is built at Stonehenge and at Giza and just how the &quot;resurrection machine&quot; works. The alternative too me writing is silence but that would mean building these places was a colossal waste of time and effort, so the truth will be told and then it would be good to debate as to its relevance.", "comment_date": "2020-02-10T10:12:39Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Brice Mauritz", "comment_text": "Because famous hippies told them lord zenu wanted them to gees guys .... what other reason could possibly make as much sense.....", "comment_date": "2020-02-10T00:04:36Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Bang Chamber", "comment_text": "Congrats.

Yes, we might know just enough to get a general idea of what took place around specific places and times, but just stop and think for a moment about all of the things that certainly happened around/near Stonehenge. These were human beings, after all, and they were really not all that very different from you and me today with respect to their basic biological makeup including everything that that entails. People met and had romantic affairs (while, yes, they were certainly not <i>exactly</i> like today&#39;s relationships, the basic fundamental emotions they would have felt would still be very familiar to you and me today); political escapades and fiascos would have abounded around such an important site; small wars replete with triumphant victories and agonizing defeats ran their course; extended families met in joyful gatherings/feasts and they most certainly had their fair share of awkward moments complete with weird family members being snickered at (or feared/loathed). And many many more wonderful as well as awful events and occurrences almost without count all took place with many many humans involved; all experiencing joy and sadness, laughter and rage, perplexity and enlightenment, and every other singular emotion, both simple and complex, that each and every one of us feels today.<br><br>However, virtually <i>all</i> of these stories have been lost to the winds and sands of staggeringly ponderous time. And all we have left of that Himalayan dwarfing mountain of human emotions is a few cold grey silent monoliths planted in the earth, and even they will eventually and most certainly disappear at some point in the (hopefully) very very distant future. So, if someday you ever somehow find yourself visiting such a place, slowly and solemnly approach one of those massive megalithic stones, place your hands upon it, look up to its top where it meets the sky, and then slowly close your eyes and listen to the wind. Try to see if you can imagine or even feel the lives and emotions of all those many many <i>many</i> people, people who you almost certainly share genetic material with*. Honor their lost stories, both minor and epic, by thinking about where we&#39;ve been together as a species and where we&#39;re headed. What kind of millennial project could <i>we</i> aspire to build which would instill awe and wonder in the humans of the far future? And also try to think about how you yourself would want to be remembered by someone thousands of years from now. Maybe if more people thought in that way, especially with the aid of literal touchstones, it would help to insure a positive future for <i>all</i> humanity; both reminding and instilling in us the fact that we are all in this together and that by working together we can almost certainly tip the oh so very tenuous balance of success and failure in our favor. Long may Stonehenge remain. :) Take care, everyone! :)<br><br>*I read somewhere that you only have to go back about 2 or 3 thousand years in your family tree to find an ancestor who is common to every other human alive today.

And that imo is the key, tradition, we people like to know where other settlements are and we stick to traditions, this means that even though tribes have split, their knowledge that those tribes exist stayed, maybe they have relatives there. So tribes, settlements that are still allied decide to create a monument, in their times it would be a burial site, but they wanted to make this one special, make it big. Thus starting to work on stone henge. It would be a place to burry heroes, leaders and important people in their own tribes and bury them on one sacred piece of land, this would explain why different remains have different wood used for cremation, or that they&#39;ve eaten different type of food. Remember we like to honor the dead, and we honor traditions. Or it could be ritual site, maybe for honorable sacrifices, where people may have chosen to be a sacrifice and that would call for a ritual, even Vikings did this where people would come forth to be a sacrifice, the people of that settlement would then travel to a sacred land to do so. These two theories can also explain why there are two types of rock found in Stonehenge from two different regions, one further than the other. My guess is that they would bring a rock with them with 2 sacrifices or people to bury (75 stones are at Stonehenge and 150 buried souls).

The researchers thought maybe that Stonehenge was for the dead, but Woodhenge was for the living; and that maybe people traveled from far away to these two henges as a yearly event - perhaps as a kind of tribal reunion? It seems that the wooden henge might have seen use for ceremonies and rites - maybe marriages, or inter-clan negotiations, the kind of thing that ends feuds and seals alliances. Or, maybe it was more like the ancient Norse &quot;Althing&quot; - a large meeting of chieftains where laws could be debated and various legal disputes settled. This was all quite a while ago, but I was fascinated by the idea. After all, the Egyptians and other ancient cultures certainly had various yearly events, both religious and not; it makes sense that wandering tribes might also need to meet at some regular point in time, to keep touch, or to trade, or to make marriage matches between clans.<br><br><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Stonehenge-Understanding-Mysteries-Greatest-Monument/dp/1615191933\">https://www.amazon.com/Stonehenge-Understanding-Mysteries-Greatest-Monument/dp/1615191933</a><br><br>That&#39;s the book; this link shows the reprint from 2014, but I read it in the first printing. :)", "comment_date": "2019-02-22T00:38:31Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "richard bidinger", "comment_text": "It still amazes me that scientists refuse to consider that the people who built these things had wheels.

Also that the skeleton dug up at stonehenge  who was dubbed the Amesbury Archer,  was shown to have come  all the way from central Europe. That is really impressive.<br>Also don&#39;t totally rule out Merlin and King Arthur. The legend of these guys was always acknowledged to have originated in a non literary culture. Old stories can stick around especially if you have massive &#39;round tables&#39; sat in the middle of your land to remind you of them. If you accept that merlin was actually someone who was considered a wizard because he could make swords at the start of the bronze age, which is also when horses are brought in to Britain and that a great leader might have set up a great culture that lasted for a long time and had a huge effect on people and was worth writing down, stonehenge and the Early bronze age seems a much better candidate for the legend of King Arthur than the dark ages where a local lord clinging to the remains of Roman glory could have generated all this positive press by fighting off the saxons for a couple of years. Plus swords weren&#39;t that amazing and magical in the dark ages. But in the early bronze age they would have been something utterly incredible and worth writing stories about. Plus there are lots of ancient traditions about ritual deposits in pools from that time.
