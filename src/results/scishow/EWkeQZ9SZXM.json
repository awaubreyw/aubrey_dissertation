While harnessing that much geomagnetic energy it might be possible to tune the occilating frequency output from the obelisk towers. Thus turning it into an ancient two way antenna/ Ham Radio. If the output carrier wave were specifically tuned to the inverse harmonic resonance of the ionosphere you could, in theory, bounce data packets across the world to every other pyramidal structure set as a two way receiving antenna, simultaneously.

One major way that humans are influencing the environment is by turning rural areas into cities and towns. Urbanization can have consequences for the species in an area, but some lucky species are able to make themselves a home in their new environment. White ibises are wading birds related to egrets and storks that live along the coasts of the southeastern U.S. and Mexico. These birds spend a lot of their time eating handouts from people, including scraps from dumpsters and garbage cans. Poor nutrition can change the types of bacteria living in their guts and can also lead to higher levels of pathogens like Salmonella.<br>An annoying species of mosquito that feeds on human blood is thought to have originated on the London Underground. But a new study has found that the same species already existed in Egypt almost 100 years before the Underground was built. This particular mosquito thrives in spaces humans have created, like damp underground cellars, sewers, and subways.<br>In populations that get fished a lot, survival of the fittest favors timid, smaller fish, which are less desirable to humans and less likely to get themselves caught. This study shows how fishing practices have changed the course of this species&#39; evolution.<br>The average size of bighorn sheep&#39;s horns declined by over 20% after trophy hunting wiped out the large-horned males before they could reproduce. Researchers in Canada analyzed almost 40 years&#39; worth of data, including 23 years of intense hunting. Since the most intensive hunting stopped in 1996, the length of the animals&#39; horns has yet to return to their previous length, hinting at a permanent change in the population&#39;s genetic makeup.", "comment_date": "2022-05-29T23:21:03Z", "likes_count": 4}, {"comment_by": "F**k V1nce Cuh", "comment_text": "I&#39;m a Brooklynite and through my 18 years of life I never seen a coyote in my whole life there.
