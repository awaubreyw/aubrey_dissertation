The only concern that I would have with it is that it would put lung proteins all over the body and that the immune system may react to it if it is in a place other then the lung.  This may train the immune system to attack lung tissue.  Though it may not do this.  Just speculation.  If it is found to be safe, then this may be the best way to fight viruses without messing with the immune systems functions.  Much safer then modern vaccine tech in my opinion.  Down side is it does not actually make the immune system stronger the way a vaccines can (if built properly). I am also looking forward to the lama anti-body research.  It looks promising.  One thing I will not accept however is any solution that utilizes genetic engineering or live virus vaccines. Dead virus vaccines are ok in my opinion but would likely be less effective.  Live virus vaccines are in my humble too dangerous for this particular virus and I will not allow my genes to be messed with by faceless, unaccountable corporations.", "comment_date": "2020-07-30T02:39:38Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Mirrored {} Chaos", "comment_text": "scientists: inject virus fighting cells into human<br>human&#39;s immune system: destroys injected cells as it is a foreign body<br>scientists:   :o", "comment_date": "2020-07-30T02:36:10Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "AJ-YT", "comment_text": "can u please go in depth of hydroxicloroquine? because of the recent viral video of the american frontliner doctors it really messed me up with whats true or not . does the hydrocloroquine really cure covid? so many videos on youtube show that it does, but studies say that hydrochloroquine vs a placebo didnt even give effect. they say East Asian countries use that med and it helps.", "comment_date": "2020-07-30T02:32:15Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "muhsin sahindal", "comment_text": "The gradient on that sweater just looks so out of place and odd", "comment_date": "2020-07-30T02:31:47Z", "likes_count": 7}, {"comment_by": "SangoProductions213", "comment_text": "Meanwhile, Sweeden never locked down, peaked months ago, and now has almost no cases.
