The YouTube channel SuspiciousObservers can inform you about the &quot;global electric circut&quot; and the &quot;electric universe&quot; models that explain how that plasma, and ejecta (when it leaves the sun) are composed of all the elements on the periodic table and create a path for electricity to flow out from the sun. The ejecta, from a coronal mass ejection, and electrolysis in our atmosphere is the most likely source of water on earth. Our electromagnetic shield makes an atmosphere possible, otherwise solar wind would blow away the gas surrounding our planet. Under the earth&#39;s crust there are &quot;earth spot&quot; events that guide major weather patterns above the crust. I am an environmentalist, but our climate and weather are guided by solar cycles with punctuated equallibrium from comets and large asteroids. It&#39;s possible that our planet passes through a few different patches of space rocks, making a cycle out of the cosmic events as well. Our ancient ancestors would not have been able to make the zodiac calendars if they did not know about thousands of years of cosmic documentation. That&#39;s simple logic. 12,800ish years ago one large comet wiped out whatever culture was around while hunter gatherers were able to survive because they were not weakened by the social structures our species creates. Basically if you depend upon the grocery store, you won&#39;t survive as long as people who regularly go hunting and grow food.
