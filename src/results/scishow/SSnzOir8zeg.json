Thanks for doing them!<br><br>Two things about the chimps blew my mind:<br>1. In one instance, three other chimps observed a mother caring for her adolescent son: the wounded chimp&#39;s older sister, a female group member, and a male group member who was observed having his own wounds treated by others both before and after the event he observed. There is a paper out there from ~2020 proposing that spoken language evolved as a way to better communicate regarding tool fabrication and usage. It sounds so similar and plausible to me. My mind blew because it made me ask questions about what is human nature. How hard is it for humans to help one another and get along? How natural is that behavior?<br><br>2. Is it unreasonable to imagine that there is a significant probability that at least some of the wisdom of ancient natural medicines that we know work (willow and aspirin, for example) have been passed down from pre-human ancestors? Mind blown. There is a school of thought that the mix of annual plants (so-called weeds) that dominate in a particular area in a given season present preventive health and nutrition properties appropriate for the current environment. It&#39;s not a stretch. I observed on my small farm in the fall of 2019 a whole acre covered by a foot-high plant I couldn&#39;t remember seeing before, copper leaf, and a strong than typical establishment of mullein, both of which have applications for respiratory illnesses.<br><br>Now, THAT&#39;S a leap, I know, but compared to the cumulative harm of ~100 years of massive, indiscriminate inundation of the population with pharmaceuticals treating symptoms and not causes, choosing natural methods more and more is going to come closer to giving us the outcomes we must all certainly be hoping for, namely, always moving toward a sustainable approach to managing nearly 8 billion humans. \ud83d\ude42", "comment_date": "2022-02-12T03:30:40Z", "likes_count": 15}, {"comment_by": "\u0425\u041e\u0420\u041e\u0428\u041e", "comment_text": "Helping unrelated individuals was probably the work of this particular chimp, he was a doctor.", "comment_date": "2022-02-12T03:23:30Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Chas Laspata", "comment_text": "I called the chimp dr and this is what he said, he said \u201c eww eee, eww ahh ahh, Bee \ud83d\udc1d bang, walla walla, be bang!\u201d<br><br>\ud83d\ude1d\ud83d\ude06\ud83d\ude2d\ud83e\udd23\ud83d\ude02", "comment_date": "2022-02-12T03:12:58Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Sqrt 2", "comment_text": "I like how it goes from our closest animal relative to our most distant animal relative.", "comment_date": "2022-02-12T03:00:04Z", "likes_count": 17}, {"comment_by": "Adam Slater", "comment_text": "So we still have SciNews but it\u2019s just no longer under that moniker?", "comment_date": "2022-02-12T02:59:46Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "oopsy444", "comment_text": "The question is how long can the sponges even last on the non renewable resource of the dead worms?
