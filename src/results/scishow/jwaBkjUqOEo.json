This is where most cattle are crowded in the final months of their 1.5- to 2-year lives to rapidly put on weight before slaughter. There, algae feed additives can be churned into the cows\u2019 grain and soy feed. But on feedlots, cattle already belch less methane\u2014only 11 percent of their lifetime output. That\u2019s because most of their methane comes from their gut microbes breaking down the indigestible grass, leaves, and roughage they eat on the pastures beforehand, and not from feedlot corn and soy. This means that even if algae diets on feedlots worked perfectly, it wouldn\u2019t help with the 89 percent of cows\u2019 belches that occur earlier in their lives.\r<br>\r<br>Unfortunately, adding the algae to diets on the pasture, where it\u2019s most needed, isn\u2019t a feasible option either. Out on grazing lands, it\u2019s difficult to get cows to eat additives because they don\u2019t like the taste of red algae unless it\u2019s diluted into feed. And even if we did find ways to sneak algae in somehow, there\u2019s a good chance their gut microbes would adapt and adjust, bringing their belches\u2019 methane right back to high levels.\r<br>\r<br>All told, if we accept the most promising claims of the algae boosters, we\u2019re talking about an 80 percent reduction of methane among only 11 percent of all burps\u2014roughly an 8.8 percent reduction total. Maybe a little more if we can work algae into cows\u2019 diets on pastures. And that would only really count as a serious climate change mitigation strategy if we could find a way to change the diets of hundreds of millions of cows. This is not only a major logistical and economic challenge, it might also pose its own issues since we\u2019d have to contend with the potential ecological impact of large-scale algae farming, be it in the wild or in aquaculture operations.\r<br>\r<br>And there\u2019s another problem. Although cow belches are the largest source of agricultural methane, beef and dairy production involve lots of other climate emissions, from their manure to the fertilizer sprayed on their crops and grasses, through to the transport of the animals and later the meat. While there may be technological solutions to all of these different emissions in a cow\u2019s life cycle, algae is far from the silver bullet that can solve all of them.\r<br>\r<br>It\u2019s tempting to believe in quick technological fixes that will let us keep indulging in burgers without the climate guilt. That\u2019s also why major beef producers and fast food chains are advertising it so heavily. But the fact is that currently, the only real solution available is to produce and eat less beef. According to leading experts in food and energy systems, we need to invest most of our efforts into solutions available to us today to stop greenhouse gas emissions from entering our atmosphere. As the World Wildlife Fund\u2019s lead food scientist wrote last week, all of these solutions become easier to implement if we reduce our pressure on land and the climate by shifting toward more plant-based diets.&quot;  \r<br><a href=\"https://www.wired.com/story/carbon-neutral-cows-algae/\">https://www.wired.com/story/carbon-neutral-cows-algae/</a>", "comment_date": "2021-10-26T22:42:15Z", "likes_count": 15}, {"comment_by": "Butter Chuggins", "comment_text": "Seems made up", "comment_date": "2021-10-26T22:36:21Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "XVeganDaveGodFreeX", "comment_text": "Or just go vegan.", "comment_date": "2021-10-26T22:35:51Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "John Lane", "comment_text": "Nobody wants to admit it the problem is there are just to many people on this rock.", "comment_date": "2021-10-26T21:45:13Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "daesyoung", "comment_text": "isnt seaweed by weight 80% iodide.? we all have to give it up to seaweed tho cus we wouldnt be breathing without its foliage netting inside tidal mass crashes swings from the moon reintroducing oxygen.", "comment_date": "2021-10-26T21:22:08Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Boris Hamanov", "comment_text": "I see only one problem.

We have to think about our children and all the people worldwide that have no chance to become carbon neutral by 2050. <br><br>Africa is finally coming out of a disaster of an economy. They have a vast young population, and they will be hungry for consumption. SO. We need to do this almost alone, and we do owe them that! We destroyed their countries with our stupid wars and slavery. Not too long ago when maniacs were running the world. Sure our guys aren&#39;t perfect, but it is a lot better than back then. There is so much less war now, even with all those weapons they have. <br><br>You can use the wood of the forest for whatever we need, and there seems to be a lot of need for it at the moment. Slavery is almost gone. Even with work not being as fun as it could be, it&#39;s okay. It will get better soon.<br><br>More importantly, you could suck out a lot more carbon with hemp than you ever could with trees. <br>It grows about 4-6 times as fast, and it isn&#39;t even that genetically optimized currently. <br>It would also reduce the amount of water that dissipates and even improve the soil. <br><br><br>You can use hemp wood for building. <br><br>carbon-negative houses <br><br><br>that are fireproof,<br><br><br>perfectly insulated,<br><br>and said to be <br><br>The most comfortable homes to live in.<br><br>It is probably due to the natural antifungal property of hemp. <br><br>Mold can&#39;t grow on it. <br><br>That is why it quickly grows as well. <br><br>Also again<br><br>&quot;most comfortable homes to live in.&quot; <br><br>Because due to the cell structure of hemp wood automatically regulates the dampness of the room. If there is too much water in the room, it sucks it up and releases it when it becomes too dry. It is the perfect building material, and it has been on the market for more than two last years. (Buy it now because it will be more expensive for a while). This property is probably also why you can even grow it in desert areas. <br><br>We could save tons of power just by not having to heat and cool. <br><br>Also,<br><br>As I said, it is fireproof. Forest fires are meaningless, thanks to it. Just stay indoors, and you will be fine.<br><br>That should reduce the base power needs substantially. <br><br>That should make it easy to switch away from carbon power. <br><br>Hemp produces a lot of the best oil. <br><br>We could immediately be independent of fossil fuels because we could just create biodiesel that is carbon natural. So we would not even need to switch to electric cars.<br><br><br>We can still build solar and wind. It will give us a solid deflationary time. With all the access power we will have and the extreme reduction of taxes.<br><br>We can eat it also. It has really great protein and is rich in omega 3 fatty acids. So we would have a lot more food. Also, Canada just lost 50% of its harvest! 50%... Hemp is a lot more resistant to our new climate.<br><br><br>So. Let do this!

Common side effects of too much iodine can cause fever, diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, burning sensations in throat and mouth and stomach pain.<br>Also, this is something I&#39;ve noticed in every study that starts feeding cows other things besides grass: a cow isn&#39;t a herbivore, it&#39;s a grass eater. Seaweed isn&#39;t grass... They&#39;re highly specialised to eat grass. Other plants can be digested but I assume only in small amounts before, like with all animals, it becomes too much for them to digest.<br>My opinion is simply that I&#39;ve seen a lot of research that focusses on having cake and eating it too. I understand people are accustomed to highly industrial food, but... I think it&#39;s time to seriously consider maybe to stop industrialising animals and crops all together. Farmers can still be there. Nothing needs to change in that regard, just instead of trying to feed states, countries and the world, just simply stop all this garbage and start making localised foods only. You can still get foods that aren&#39;t local, but they would cost way more. It will lower the imprint on the environment to a point where it&#39;s back in balance with what it used to be. What do we do with worldwide needs? Start looking into growing food in the lab. Give people an option: either get local food or lab grown food.
