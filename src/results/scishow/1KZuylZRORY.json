Generally good but that one contributes to a FALSE impression. Carbonic acid is a very weak acid, we have it in our bodies, the oceans are alkaline at pH 8.11. Carbonic acid can make that water slightly less alkaline but the notion that our oceans are now acid and becoming &quot;more acidic&quot; is terrifying and a common falsehood being perpetuated, our oceans are basic (alkaline). Look up ocean slowing, it means the upper warmer layer can&#39;t absorb as much CO2 and has been happening for 200 years. <br>2013: &quot;The oceans as a whole have a large capacity for absorbing CO2, but ocean mixing is too slow to have spread this additional CO2 deep into the ocean. As a result, ocean waters deeper than 500 meters (about 1,600 feet) have a large but still unrealized absorption capacity, said Scripps geochemist Ralph Keeling&quot;<br>.<br>Also I understand the ocean floor basalt is alkaline and also a factor due to the reduced mixing now.", "comment_date": "2020-11-14T10:41:17Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Gary Ha", "comment_text": "Warming bad seems to be an assumption, since past civilizations always thrived in warmer periods so I&#39;m looking for something convincing", "comment_date": "2020-11-14T10:28:54Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Abel De La Cruz", "comment_text": "That&#39;s cool because I garden and I use gypsum to break-up the clay in my garden soil  here in Dallas Texas.
