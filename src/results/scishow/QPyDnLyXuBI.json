The vaccine for Ebola, rVSV-ZEBOV, was finished by 2003, underwent animal trials, and was ready for human Phase 1 trials over a decade ago. It sat on a shelf in Winnipeg (where it was developed by the Public Health Agency of Canada...yes, taxpayer-funded research can produce immeasurable success, and this is a great example of that) for 5 years until a few thousand people started dying in West Africa, at which point, FINALLY some people got off their derri\u00e8res and started the process (it was licensed to NewLink Genetics in 2010 for the purposes of those Phase 1 trials being conducted, but they didn&#39;t do ANYTHING with it, apparently, until a LOT of people started dying in 2014, making it impossible NOT to do something). The vaccine was re-licensed to Merck (for something like 200X the cost NewLink paid for it), and the WHO authorized accelerated trials in West Africa. And finally, more than 15 years after it was created, we have hundreds of thousands of doses of an Ebola vaccine available to front line health care workers in Ebola-affected areas, and people who may have come in contact with an infected person (as well as to people who are travelling to Ebola hot zones who may be at risk). ZMapp, and the other treatments, underwent a similar trajectory, having their big break only because of all the deaths in Liberia, Sierra Leone and Guinea. So at this point, it looks like (hopefully) the outbreak in the DRC will be the LAST major Ebola crisis the world sees. Sure, there might be some small situations popping up over the years, but with the tools available, Ebola will no longer be the big scary monster it used to be. Now we just have to worry about the NEXT major pathogen to emerge from the rainforest as humans further encroach into areas they never lived in before...and that&#39;s a scary thought.", "comment_date": "2019-08-23T21:20:41Z", "likes_count": 246}, {"comment_by": "Avery the Cuban-American", "comment_text": "We can cure ebola as long as we bless the rains and know da wae", "comment_date": "2019-08-23T21:20:24Z", "likes_count": 11}, {"comment_by": "Sadat Iqbal Priom", "comment_text": "This video should be in the top 10 in YouTube trending", "comment_date": "2019-08-23T21:20:06Z", "likes_count": 255}, {"comment_by": "Jerry", "comment_text": "Let\u2019s hope HIV can be targeted next.", "comment_date": "2019-08-23T21:17:39Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Blauman", "comment_text": "Cuba Gooding Jr. is happy!", "comment_date": "2019-08-23T21:16:05Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Nerine", "comment_text": "This is great news.

It&#39;s great news that scientists indeed have found promising drugs to cure the disease!

These are machines of the size of a usb-stick which can read DNA or RNA sequences! Due to their small size they were used to travel around different parts to track down the spread of the Ebola virus and prevent further outbreaks (would love to make a video about this story in the nearer future!)
