Phase changes either absorb or release a tremendous amount of energy, depending on which direction you&#39;re going thermally.  Another handy feature for an air conditioner is that during phase change, the substance stays the same temperature, regardless of how much heat it absorbs or releases.  That means an air conditioner can reliably keep the evaporator (cool) coil just above freezing to get the maximum cooling without clogging up with frost.  The boiling point is pressure related, so if your a/c is low on coolant, the lower pressure in the evaporator side will drop the boiling temperature below freezing, which is why a/c units that are low on coolant tend to ice up.", "comment_date": "2016-07-06T17:48:15Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "alterionisto", "comment_text": "Nope, laser cooling is still the coolest", "comment_date": "2016-07-06T16:47:33Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Even Andy", "comment_text": "In Britain, our AC is called opening a window.

The liquid turns to gas because of a pressure change at an expansion valve, and not from the heat it received. In chemistry there&#39;s a PVT chart (pressure, volume, temperature) the 3 of which together determine if a fluid is a gas or a liquid at any moment (so, not just heat goes into determining a state!).  In fact, this particular incorrectness does a disservice to the topic of how an AC works this concept is so critical. The pressure lowering at the expansion valve causes MASSIVE cooling (it takes energy to decompress gas) which is the entire reason it&#39;s so cold in the inside coils.    Then the reverse happens outside - an electrically powered compressor causes the gas to undergo a state change to liquid - this state change makes the liquid hotter than the hot outside ambient temperature. Again, the state change to hot liquid is by adding pressure, not by removing the heat - that comes immediately after it becomes a liquid. It&#39;s important that you make it hotter than the outside, which can be really really hot, hotter than the heat you&#39;d scoop up without compressing the gas.<br><br>Due to playing with the pressure (not heat!) of the coolant with a compressor and decompressing it, the cold is way cooler than the house, the hot is way hotter than the outside. Our heat goes along for the ride, but doesn&#39;t cause the ride. <br><br>Here&#39;s an easy way to think about it: It&#39;s easy to demonstrate decompression taking heat (or &quot;giving cold&quot;). Play with a can of compressed air; Hold  it upside down and make ice crystals form on whatever you shoot it at.  What you don&#39;t know is that when they made that can of compressed air, it got really hot. The heat energy it gave off when they filled it up by compressing the gas into a liquid, this same fluid wants back when it decompresses later. <br><br>How you pick a coolant is also interesting. You have to pick something that wont&#39; freeze at the temperatures you want it at, and it has to be able to go from gas to liquid lots of times over and over without changing to something else in the process (like sludge buildup, or something equally as bad).", "comment_date": "2016-07-01T01:08:38Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Seth", "comment_text": "QQ: why are concussions so severe?", "comment_date": "2016-07-01T01:03:24Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Scubadog", "comment_text": "Meanwhile I&#39;m sitting in 33 degree weather with no A/C.<br><br>Groaning at the ceiling has become one of my main pastimes.", "comment_date": "2016-07-01T00:54:25Z", "likes_count": 31}, {"comment_by": "Alexander D", "comment_text": "That&#39;s cool.", "comment_date": "2016-07-01T00:54:08Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "galamonkey", "comment_text": "As a Floridian, I really dont care what side effects the air conditioning has on the environment.

The term used in refrigeration is &quot;vaporization.&quot;  The energy needed for a change of state from a liquid at a specific temperature to a gas at the same temperature is called &quot;latent heat of vaporization.&quot; The refrigeration cycle consists of 4 components in this specific order: Compressor, condenser, metering device, evaporator. Every liquid including water has specific pressure/temperature ratios that determine whether it&#39;s going to be a liquid or a gas at a specific temperature and pressure. Refrigerants have the same properties. Some are high pressure refrigerants, and others are low pressure. Anyway, this could go on and on, but the basic refrigeration cycle is made possible by change of state, and taking on or giving up latent heat energy and sensible heat energy.

Air Conditioning makes use of two mechanisms:<br>1. Heat flows from hot to cold<br>2. When a gas changes pressure quickly, it&#39;s temperature changes.  Specifically, if it drops in pressure quickly, it usually cools.  And if it rises in pressure quickly, it warms up.  <br>So let&#39;s start with the compressor: the refrigerant (the working fluid) is first compressed.  This gives it the pressure needed to drive the cycle, but as described in point 2, heats it up, too.  Now the fluid is hotter than the outside air.  So heat moves naturally out of the fluid into the outside air.  It then cools until it is close to the ambient outside temperature.  This is done with heat exchangers inside the AC unit that touch the outside air.  <br>This hasn&#39;t helped us cool the inside of the building yet.  But the next stage is throttling: using a narrow orifice, we can cause the pressure to drop significantly in the gas, which as stated in point 1, causes it to cool.  This makes the fluid very cold, even colder than the temperature you want inside the house.  So we can run a heat exchagner (similar to the one used on the outside) through the room, allowing the warm room air to transfer its heat to the fluid (again, heat flows from hot to cold).  After which, it returns to the compressor to continue the cycle.  <br>In this way, an AC unit takes heat out of the room and transfers it to the outside.  A refrigerator works similarly, only instead of moving heat from the building outside, it removes heat from it&#39;s refrigerated space and transfers heat to the room.  You can use most gasses as refrigerants, but only a couple are actually efficient.  Usually, to be efficient, it needs to partially liquefy after the throttling process (become so cold that it partially condenses).  This makes the heat transfer process more consistent.  This is why most refrigerants are weird chemicals: they need to have just the right thermodynamic properties to be efficient.", "comment_date": "2016-06-30T23:13:57Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Master Therion", "comment_text": "I would rather die than live without AC. <br>&quot;They may take our lives, but they&#39;ll never take our FREON!&quot;", "comment_date": "2016-06-30T23:11:52Z", "likes_count": 63}, {"comment_by": "Robbie Kay", "comment_text": "According to the Guardian, it is also the most sexist idea ever.<br><br>/obvious exaggeration/", "comment_date": "2016-06-30T23:11:25Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "PrettyDecentSkele", "comment_text": "Thinking about the future of air conditioning is a COOL idea<br>Maybe they&#39;ll use ACtinium as a new substance to use<br>*note - these are puns, COOL ones", "comment_date": "2016-06-30T23:10:55Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "h def", "comment_text": "no pun intended?", "comment_date": "2016-06-30T23:07:03Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Install a Friend", "comment_text": "I like these history-based episodes.<br>Please, more of this man", "comment_date": "2016-06-30T23:06:42Z", "likes_count": 5}, {"comment_by": "happypoop3636", "comment_text": "We generally don&#39;t have them in the uk, we really don&#39;t need them, it just rains, all the time.", "comment_date": "2016-06-30T22:58:51Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "PistonAvatarGuy", "comment_text": "Swamp coolers are also a common way to keep homes and buildings cool in the southwestern US.", "comment_date": "2016-06-30T22:56:35Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Jeera B", "comment_text": "l gonna take a shower now because it&#39;s 100\u00b0F in here \ud83d\ude27\ud83d\ude29\ud83d\udd25\ud83d\udd25", "comment_date": "2016-06-30T22:56:01Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Ian Ciborowski", "comment_text": "What about<br><br><br><br><br>Air shampooing<br><br><br><br><br>Get it?
