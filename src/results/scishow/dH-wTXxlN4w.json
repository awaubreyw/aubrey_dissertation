Reopen Now!!Look I&#39;m a taxi driver and a nurse told me that they do free testing sites for covid-19. <br>The way a person gets an appointment is by downloading an app and the person chooses the location closes to them by appointment. She had a Filipino accent so I couldn&#39;t understand why they shut down early but they had to shut down early. When they reopened the people that were not able to get their appointment due to the site shutting down early, returned  to that testing site upset because the app told them they were positive when they haven&#39;t been tested.  <br>FOLLOW THE MONEY, COVID IS REAL...but they are over exaggerating the death toll and the number of people that have tested positive for covid-19. ITS A SCAM PLANNED DEMIC. W\u00e0tch meeting 201 on YouTube &amp; Bill Gates Eugenics project. <br><br>IF WE DONT STOP ACTING LIKE ROBOTS AND STOP WEARING MASK WHEN YOU&#39;RE IN YOUR CAR, WALKING YOUR DOG, EXERCISING...THEY ARE GOING TO FORCE VACCINATE US ALL WITH A VENOMOUS VACCINE THAT HAS NOT BEEN TESTED LONG ENOUGH and people are getting SICK AND SOCIAL MEDIA IS TAKING DOWN THESE videos down. My phone gets messed with, they&#39;ll put my phone on airplane mode and also deactivate my internet connection on my cellphone but I k\u00f1ow how to fix it now. My phone spells words wrong on purpose because I mass post. They try to make me look bad so ppl get tired of reading my post...it&#39;s cr\u00e0zy &amp; it&#39;s \u00e0ll against our constitutional rights. YouTube, FB needs to be sanctioned for this.<br>PFIZER IS SUING THE PEOPLE who ARE CLAIMING THEY GOT SICK FROM THE VACCINE, YET WE CANNOT SUE PFIZER  or moderna BECAUSE IT&#39;S IN THERE BUSINESS bylaws/MODEL. <br><br>IF WE CAN&#39;T SUE THEM FOR DAMAGES, THEN YOU CANT GIVE ME A VACCINE THAT I CAN NOT SUE YOU FOR GETTING ME SICK or for killing me. Look up the effects of aluminum i\u00f1 our bodies... That&#39;s just one of the many toxins/carcinogens in this vaccine and all the v\u00e0ccines and it should be illegal!! The more they vaccinate us, the more people r being diagnosed w/cancer. Hello!<br><br>This is a money move for the rich. Follow the money. Bill Gates foundation, Big PHARMA, and everyone who has invested in the Pfizer and Moderna stock will profit, that&#39;s why they are pushing all these lies. Meanwhile WE ARE LOSING EVERYTHING! PEOPLE ARE LIVING IN THEIR CARS, MOVING OUT OF STATE WITH FAMILY MEMBER and they get richer. <br><br>In 2016 or so I picked up a guy in South San Francisco who either worked for big Pharma or the FDA, they share a parking lot and the conversation got heated because I told him I was di\u00e0gnosed  with \u00e7\u00e0ncer in 2005 and I beat cancer naturally and he told me that they were going to shut down people like me. I told him &quot;you cannot shut me down, I am not a store&quot;. He told me well, they&#39;re going to start shutting down vitamin stores becuz people like you, think you&#39;re Doctor&#39;s...I said sir!...who do u work for besides the devil? He said I&#39;m not going to tell you! I told him look...I know where I picked you up &amp; you either work for big Pharma or the FDA. Look...you think you&#39;re some big shot bcuz you think u got some insight to everything bcuz of who you work for BUT IF U WERE TO GET CANCER, DO YOU THINK THEY would give U THE NEW TREATMENT FOR CANCER that they have, that would get rid of most Cancers in about 7 weeks. No...they would ZAP U WITH THEIR TOXIC CHEMOTHERAPY JUST LIKE EVERYONE ELSE!!! THEY LET John McCain DIE AND HE SERVED OUR COUNTRY and they&#39;d let you die too...I&#39;m alive bcuz I knew better than to do CHEMO &amp; you are hating on ME! Shame on you bcuz I made it by studying cancer and ended up beating it? I told him you go tell your boss and whoever you work for that if you shutdown vitamin stores &amp; stop selling these products I use to keep my cancer away, I will start a revolt in this country bcuz I&#39;ve seen enough of Big Pharma &amp; the fda&#39;s corruption becuz I know what they&#39;re doing to the people with chemotherapy and radiation when they&#39;ve got the less toxic cures for cancers bcuz  I&#39;ve talked to many biotech engineers who told me that they can get rid of cancer with stem cell therapy/  immunotherapy...I said look its UP, ITS ON YOUTUBE., Look up &quot;VISE&quot; - KILLING CANCER.. meanwhile we are ZAPPING OUR BABIES &amp; LOVED ONES WITH TOXIC CHEMO THAT IS KILLING THEM &amp; I&#39;m not tolerating this anymore...I tell anyone that will listen to what I did. I shut him up. <br>I took Super greens powder (the Country farm brand) from <a href=\"http://walmart.com/\">walmart.com</a> <br><br>Chaga mushrooms only by The natures way brand online because it&#39;s hard to find in stores but they are powerful mushrooms. I took Pau D&#39; Arco (&quot;Natures way&quot; brand) take as directed but you must take it for 10 to 15 or so days then stop for 3, 5 to 7 days to rest the kidneys,then repeat as directed (u can take it for 10,15 &amp; up to 30 d\u00e0ys but  then repeat as the bottle suggest &amp; stop for 3,5 or 7...it \u00e0ll depends on the height, weight &amp; kidneys function.<br>I also boil a cup of water &amp; added 1/4 teaspoon of Baking soda 2 to 3 times a day. That also must be stopped if you feel dizzy (it just means that you&#39;re over alkaline- no biggie- it beat CHEMOTHERAPY trust me. <br>I took aloe vera capsules, I buy them at the vitamin shop. I take 2 or 3 in the morning, 2 to 3 at Lunch &amp; 2 or 3  before bedtime. (Again scale down dose if it&#39;s hard on the kidneys) <br><br>I took CBD oil under my tongue two or three times a day. It must be a indica grade plant not a sativa or something comparable to indica plant. <br>Tumeric is good to take also (Google a good brand with 5 stars rating) <br><br>Stop drinking all soda, sugar, bread because it turns into sugar. Stop eating all fast food, you must stop eating meat, eggs, milk with hormones, I eat all beans of all kinds, all homemade salad and homemade salad dressing. A quick salad dressing is made with a good olive oil (from another country, not the U.S.A.) red wine vinegar and lemon with all the spice&#39;s you like. <br><br>The salad dressing that they sell us in the stores 9 times out of 10 has carrageenan &amp; xanthan gum which is very bad for us.. look up how bad these products are for us. <br><br>Stop eating all cereal, pretty much it is filled with a bunch of junk and high sugar content. <br><br>Download the fooducate app. pick food from B+ &amp; higher, try to stick with food that&#39;s b+ and above. <br>if you touch/hit the grade of your food on this app, u can see all the junk that&#39;s in it. <br><br>Take yourself off the high risk food &amp; put yourself on the low-risk food. <br><br>Download the &quot;think dirty&quot; app, it grades all your lotions, potions, shampoos and toothpaste etc. Stop wearing makeup becuz they&#39;re putting a bunch of junk that cause us all sorts of cancers. <br><br>We must defund big Pharma and the FDA bcuz they are harming us and not helping us. <br><br>People live longer in other countries bcuz they eat natural fruits &amp; vegetables that don&#39;t have all the pesticides &amp; herbicides that the FDA allows in our food. DO YOU THINK THAT THE FDA IS REALLY GOING TO APPROVE A VACCINE THAT&#39;S HEALTHY FOR US!? <br><br>BOOST YOUR IMMUNE SYSTEM BY TAKING VITAMINS AND MINERALS &amp; SUPER GREENS POWDER. With covid-19 u must take zinc, D3 &amp; Vitamin C, ITS EASY. <br><br>STOP BELIEVING THE NEWS WHO ARE OWNED BY ALL THE RICH PEOPLE THAT HAVE AN AGENDA TO KEEP US SICK &amp; ON THEIR BIG PHARMA PILLS. I believe that the 1918 flu was also a scam &amp; the elitist were also killing ppl. <br><br>THEY&#39;RE RUNNING A CAMPAIGN RECENTLY TO HAVE YOU GO GET TESTED FOR CANCER. ITS A CAMPAIGN TO MAKE THEM LOTS $$.<br> YOU&#39;LL HEAR COMMERCIALS ALL DAY LONG ABOUT THIS. <br>JUST DO THE ABOVE THINGS MINUS THE PAU D ARCO. AND DONT DO THE baking soda tea just like 3 times a week or so IF U DON&#39;T HAVE CANCER. <br><br>DISCLOSURES: <br>I AM NOT A DOCTOR, YOU MUST CHECK WITH YOUR DOCTOR BEFORE TAKING ANYTING, THIS IS NOT FDA-APPROVED, I&#39;M NOT TRYING TO CURE ANYONE FROM ANYTING. <br><br>DON&#39;T LET THEM TAKE YOUR Life AWAY FROM YOU, I CALLED THE POLICE &amp; THEY ARE NOT ENFORCING THE SHUTDOWN IN LA COUNTY, RIVERSIDE COUNTIES OR ORANGE <a href=\"http://counties.so/\">COUNTIES.SO</a> OPEN UP!<br><br>FOLOW: PEGGY HALL- THE HEALTHY <a href=\"http://american.org/\">AMERICAN.ORG</a> - ON YOUTUBE <br>U CAN DOWNLOAD ALL HER DOCUMENTS JUST IN CASE THE CITY, COUNTY IN ALL STATE TRY TO CLOSE YOUR BUSINESSES DOWN.
