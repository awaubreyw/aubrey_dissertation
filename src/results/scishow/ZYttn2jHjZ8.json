There are several reasons that we yawn. Some of the reasons that we yawn are for acclimation and equalization. We&#39;re constantly inhaling air from the outer atmosphere into our internal environment which has a different pressure. As we slow down and get tired and get ready for bed or sit down our blood flow and our respiratory patterns slow down and change which also changes the pressure. We may even breathe more through our nose which increases the amount of CO2 that we actually take in. Yawning helps to create equilibrium. If you ever go on an airplane or up and down a hill and your ears get stuffed because they need to equalize they say to chew gum. That may help but the best thing to do is to make yourself yawn as deep as you can and breathe through your nose and your mouth while you do it. Your ears will most likely pop as you equalize with the atmospheric pressure. It is most definitely a way to get oxygen deep into your lungs and into your blood and your brain. Especially when your activity has slowed down, or you&#39;ve increased activity and you&#39;re not inhaling enough oxygen. For instance if you start jogging you may actually yawn because you&#39;re using oxygen and your body has different ways to cope with that. People sometimes yawn when they jog. It&#39;s not necessarily because you&#39;re tired it&#39;s because your body is using more oxygen and because of the faster rate of breathing you have to equalize more properly. Yawning helps to push the air deep down into your lungs to equalize the pressure as well as create pressure to help push oxygen to be absorbed through your lungs.

Yawning takes in a larger amount of air and opens all the airways that have been deprived from the outside air that previously have not been in use. You tend to breathe irregularly when you&#39;re more tired or when you&#39;re doing interesting but non-active things. For SciShow to say that the oxygen answer doesn&#39;t hold up to evidence is completely absurd, this is why you can&#39;t always believe what your source tells you, even if the source does their own research into the matter. I think science is looking for a specific answer when in fact, the very means of opening airways with a larger breath does a lot for the lungs, oxygen, cooling down the body, letting previous compressed parts of the lungs to react to the atmosphere are all variables that contribute to the process of contagious yawning. It&#39;s psychologically sound to be contagious on the premise that people are likely to breath irregularly when they are not focusing on their breathing.<br><br>SciShow is actually making a &quot;correlation does not equal causation&quot; fallacy because finding studies that show people are more alert after yawning may not be the cause for why we yawn, in fact if yawning does a lot of the body already, alertness may be a benefit while not the cause of why yawning is contagious.", "comment_date": "2021-06-02T00:07:30Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Lyndsay Brown", "comment_text": "Slakoth used Yawn!<br><br>Your Pokemon grew tired and more alert to snakes.", "comment_date": "2021-06-02T00:07:14Z", "likes_count": 275}, {"comment_by": "Matthew Marr", "comment_text": "I yawned seconds after clicking on the video.
