Reaching an &quot;equilibrium&quot; doesn&#39;t mean the discriminator can&#39;t tell real from fake, that&#39;s not an equilibrium at all... in fact that&#39;s quite the opposite. Equilibrium means they both have a similar win/loss ratio. 50% of the time, the discriminator will tell real from fake, 50% of the time it won&#39;t.<br><br>GANs are described as a two-player zero-sum game. As you&#39;d expect from hearing the term zero-sum, each participants&#39; win/loss ratio is balanced (there&#39;s an equilibrium). This is what &quot;adversarial&quot; means in Generative Adversarial Networks. Both the discriminator and the generator compete against each other and they are trained using backpropagation of the same training data. <br><br>The discriminator is just a simple classifier. Whether it correctly classifies the data or not, it uses backpropagation to adjust (change the weights of) each neuron (a set of weights and an activation/squashing function, e.g. a sigmoid function). It does this over many training epochs (pass through of a dataset) until the discriminator is able to properly classify a certain percentage of test data during the validation stage of training. This percentage is known as the accuracy. So it will train based on the initial data set + the newly generated data to become an improved version of itself, and it will continue training until a goal accuracy (%) is achieved based on a certain learning rate (how likely it is to adapt/change based on differences in the data). These are all configured by the programmer, or more accurately the computer scientist.<br><br>What makes a &quot;deepfake&quot; good or bad isn&#39;t the &quot;quality of the neural net&quot;, it&#39;s the training. Data is king, that&#39;s why Google and everybody else wants your data. Sure, there are new techniques/algorithms that might make the task easier or approach it from a different angle, but that isn&#39;t necessarily better or worse. What makes a &quot;good deepfake&quot; better than an &quot;amateur deepfake&quot; is the configuration of the GANs. Not everybody is willing to pay for Microsoft Azure&#39;s or Google Cloud&#39;s AI platform to make use of their processing power, so instead &quot;amateur deepfakes&quot; use GANs that are configured with less strict accuracy and training requirements to achieve arbitrarily reasonable results within an reasonable amount of time on consumer hardware. The very same GAN can be used on a much more powerful server and achieve much better results, and likewise a consumer pc can achieve much better results by simply giving it more processing time.<br><br>And on a side note, relying on metadata is terrible. Not only is that a privacy concern, but clips get re-encoded, snipped, and mashed up all the time. As the description implies, this method relying on the metadata only works on the original raw footage, unless of course you&#39;re spoofing the metadata in which case that presents a whole &#39;nother set of issues. If proving a video is real requires metadata, that means either the public needs access to that so they can also verify it independently, or we have to take a third party&#39;s word for it which makes it pointless in the first place. If it&#39;s made public, we then have access to potentially personal info, and the person behind the camera basically just doxxed themselves at that point.", "comment_date": "2020-02-01T03:10:09Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "summerlover", "comment_text": "Cap America&#39;s bod may not be real, but Muscle Hank is.", "comment_date": "2020-01-31T10:39:57Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Spicystachegamer328 420", "comment_text": "Even if deep fakes do get that bad it will just leave room for new technology to made to distinguish diffrence between the 2 but the big problem with this tech is that it could take away jobs from actors", "comment_date": "2020-01-24T21:17:25Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "K\u00e1roly Gy\u00f6rgy Kiss", "comment_text": "This video is an example of talking too much about nothing", "comment_date": "2020-01-21T11:06:47Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Sweet Meat", "comment_text": "I dont see any good coming out of this &quot;faking real stuff&quot; things..<br>Its gonna be real bad..", "comment_date": "2020-01-21T10:43:32Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Shaunthesheep 23", "comment_text": "Im not even subscribe to this.
