How to measure what is now referred to as the &#39;atomic weight&#39; of an element and so on.  So, in effect, then, Chemistry at that point became less magic and more science.  I gather that back in the day, you would have a hard time telling the specific differences between the two notions.  There&#39;s a quip that I once heard... from somewhere.
