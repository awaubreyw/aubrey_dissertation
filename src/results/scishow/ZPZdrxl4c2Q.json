It is not a &#39;vaccine&#39; since your body does not produce its own antibodies, it simply accepts the synthetic antibodies and allows them to do their job. Since those synthetic antibodies last only about one year, it will be necessary to get a fresh injection of antibodies every year as long as the virus remains a problem in the community.
