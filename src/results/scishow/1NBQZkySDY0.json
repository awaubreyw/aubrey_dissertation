Deforestation is the problem. Reforestation or land set aside the solution. I\u2019ve witnessed it with my own eyes. <br><br>Born and bred in Africa I witnessed much of the climate change in Zimbabwe as forests were cut down for grain and tobacco cultivation and 80% of the land changed to grassland and semi-desert. The EU land set aside restores nature\u2019s powers over the climate, fixing carbon dioxide and stabilising temperatures and rainfall.  Why else is earth\u2019s atmospheric carbon dioxide just 0.04% when it straddles between Venus and Mars orbits each planet with atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations in excess of 90%? Carbon dioxide is not the demon, it is plant food and plants work for us providing us with food and controlling our climate to be most favourable for life. Carbon dioxide and fossil fuels are just side actors, just like police cars and ambulances are to accident scenes. Just because police cars and ambulances are present at every accident scene does not mean that they caused them. The same with carbon dioxide and fossil fuels, they were mere agents of deforestation but deforestation was the cause of environmental changes. <br><br>So the solution to gaining control over our environment is strengthening nature. <br><br>The first method can be used by you personally to indirectly alter the climate for the better. Change to a keto or paleo diet and minimise your carbohydrate intake. This will not only improve your health and eliminate T2D, but more importantly it will incentivise farmers to plant trees which bind soils and provide nuts and seeds for your keto diet. If you choose a high carbohydrate diet, farmers will respond by cutting down forests to grow grain for your food. So by altering your food intake to a keto or paleo diet, you alter the food chain and thus ultimately the climate. <br><br>See the best keto diet here <a href=\"https://youtu.be/gxLSxt2IKiQ\">https://youtu.be/gxLSxt2IKiQ</a><br><br>The second (macro) solution can bring about climate improvement is as follows. <br><br>1) Build plant factories to feed 7.8 billion people and liberate land and water for forests<br><a href=\"https://youtu.be/dnCQuwCtqJg\">https://youtu.be/dnCQuwCtqJg</a><br><a href=\"https://youtu.be/qGyAeqdkkbw\">https://youtu.be/qGyAeqdkkbw</a><br><a href=\"https://youtu.be/ESuzrY2abAw\">https://youtu.be/ESuzrY2abAw</a><br><br>See examples of working plant factories<br><a href=\"https://youtu.be/5clOYWsNhhk\">https://youtu.be/5clOYWsNhhk</a><br><a href=\"https://youtu.be/4CMfPLEtQMQ\">https://youtu.be/4CMfPLEtQMQ</a><br><br>2) Use cattle herds to revitalise soil<br><a href=\"https://youtu.be/vpTHi7O66pI\">https://youtu.be/vpTHi7O66pI</a><br><br>3) Use goats to reduce fire dangers in forests<br><a href=\"https://youtu.be/g9yiclBCxMo\">https://youtu.be/g9yiclBCxMo</a> <br><br>4) Use agrivoltaics to turn deserts into meadows with solar panels<br><a href=\"https://youtu.be/XwFB22r9zRo\">https://youtu.be/XwFB22r9zRo</a><br><a href=\"https://youtu.be/CS3bBO05fpU\">https://youtu.be/CS3bBO05fpU</a><br><br>5) Use marine cloud seeding to moisten and seed ocean air for clouds and rain<br><a href=\"https://youtu.be/Awf1W0-UMR4\">https://youtu.be/Awf1W0-UMR4</a><br><br>6) Use minerals to assist salmon populations <br><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haida_Salmon_Restoration_Corporation\">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haida_Salmon_Restoration_Corporation</a><br><br>Be positive.

Photosynthesis operates effectively in the temperature range of 15 to 30 degrees Centigrade. Approximately on 25 percent of atmospheric oxygen is created by land based photosynthesis ( but as deforestation increases this percentage is trending downward).  Depending on the type of plant life photosynthesis stops between 28 to 32 degrees Centigrade.  There is no other significant form of oxygen generation other than photosynthesis by carbon based plant life.  Certain plant life  operate at higher temperatures because they buffer the energy captured in the first cycle of photosynthesis called Photosynthesis I/KERB cycle and process the long term storage of the energy in the 2nd cycle of photosynthesis called Photosynthesis II/Dark cycle when the temperature drops.  The KREB cycle operates only when there is enough  light/photons to capture.  The Dark cycle operates  only when the temperature is within a  proper temperature ranges (Dark cycle enzyme operate only is a particular temperature range).  Since Earth surface is  6/7 water based ... water based photosynthesis has been the dominant oxygen producer and hence carbon dioxide scrubber  of Earth... However, other green house gases like Methane and Carbon Monoxide are NOT scrubbed by photosynthesis - and Methane has a greenhouse effect that is about 30x greater than  Carbon Dioxide. Frozen Hydrogenated Methane     is release by the melting of the frozen tundra in Russia Canada Greenland and North pole/Arctic  -  we have no idea how much is there because basic climate change research has been attacked and defunded by  big money concerns...there are places where science has yet to go BUT there are powerful economic and political  interest holding science back. There was a time when the Earth atmosphere did not have any significant amounts of oxygen and there are life forms on Earth that do not need oxygen and can survive in temperatures greater than 30 degrees centigrade. We are currently pass the tipping point for Climate Change so now it is unavoidable   ...How could mother nature make it worst?  Volcanic action. Volcanic eruption/emissions are a significant source of methane. Dust clouds from Volcanic eruptions can temporarily lower global  temperatures but volcanic methane emissions can be a factor in raising long term global temperatures. Volcanic eruption-emission or Flood Basalt eruption-emissions like the Deccan Trap can be a major source of Methane emissions....some argue that a combination of a meteor hitting the Earth and a series of Volcanic eruptions can be the one two punch that starts a global mass extinction ..You can also replace a meteor impact OR a volcanic eruption WITH  a Thermonuclear War  where multiple nuclear warheads are denotated  at the same time  ... so with respect to the end of the world ....you have options... choose from Menu A or Menu B....", "comment_date": "2021-01-30T18:24:36Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Patrick Thomsen Mantzouridis", "comment_text": "Humans in 100 years are laughing with this video.", "comment_date": "2021-01-29T18:26:29Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Cabbage Montage", "comment_text": "So, any plans?<br>&quot;Emit less&quot; ain&#39;t working, people seem to emit more.\\<br>Their mentality towards the earth is : &quot;Consume first, think later&quot;.", "comment_date": "2021-01-29T15:31:52Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Curious Merlin", "comment_text": "I saw &quot;oh no&quot; in the title and decided this was another one of the channels I watch to be entertained.", "comment_date": "2021-01-29T03:35:21Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Human Being", "comment_text": "You mentioned stats, is it possible to do a show that looks at the Earth\u2019s climate change metadata over longer periods of time?

During this warming period the global climate warmed enough that a large part of Greenland was actually green and was colonized by the Viking people who grew crops and tended herds of grazing animals (Hancock and Brian 613-617).  Agriculture in Europe thrived as the growing season grew longer and crops could be grown further north (Hancock and Brian 666).  Humanity&#39;s standard of living steadily improved for centuries as the food supply continued to increase with the warming climate.  Global warming continued until sometime in the 13th or 14th century when the Medieval Warming period transformed into the Medieval Cooling Period (also know as the dark ages).  When the climate started cooling, agriculture production started to fall and there was not enough food to feed the people or their herd animals.  The Vikings were forced to abandon their Greenland colony and turn to raiding to survive (Wallace 16-24).  In Europe, people starved and diseases were rampant.  A plague was responsible for the death of nearly 25% of the known population of the earth (Hancock and Brian 613-617).<br><br>Hancock, Paul L., Brian J. Skinner. The Oxford Companion to The Earth.

The ecosystems wouldn&#39;t be able to absorb as much to begin with if the rate of photosynthesis decreases with higher temperature, so the rate of respiration would be limited by the supply of materials made by photosynthesis.

Let me frame it like this, even alone 99% of the species on this earth have gone extinct. Also that 1% of life has continued to survive. We are the first beings to be more conscious of our own impact on the planet. I truly think the planet is going to regulate our activity somehow, if that means our extinction then so be it. But if we survive I am sure life will be more resilient and more adaptable to the next ecosystem. We need to realize we are dynamic like the earth and earth is dynamic as well. We are still thinking we are gods, but in reality the earth is building up a regulatory effect. Hopefully it doesn\u2019t mean our end.
