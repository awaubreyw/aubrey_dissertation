Whether in reference to whether your skin feels moist or dry, or whether your wooden floors, cabinet, or guitar might swell up or dry out and crack, this is all directly relative to relative humidity. The absolute volume of moisture in the air is effectively irrelevant. What makes the difference is how ready the air is (based on moisture content vs temperature, I.e., relative humidity) to absorb or release moisture. <br><br>A wood panel will maintain (almost) the exact same moisture content and dimensions at 50% humidity at 85\u00b0F, as it will at 40\u00b0F. Same goes for your skin.<br><br>The problem is not that relative humidity is a bad unit to gauge by, but rather that meteorological reports list the OUTSIDE relative humidity. When it\u2019s 75% outside in winter at 30\u00b0, but then you warm that air to 70\u00b0 Indoors, it becomes terribly (relatively) dry. Likewise, when it\u2019s 60% humidity outdoors in summer at 85\u00b0, and that air sinks down to your cool basement, the same amount of moisture leads to a very high relative humidity, resulting in the notoriously damp basement. <br><br>So I would argue that relative humidity is indeed the more practical and useful reference, with little importance on dew point or total moisture content as any kind of useful metric for general use. You just have to be looking at the relative humidity in the environment of concern, not looking at outdoor humidity as gauge to the health of your piano or violin which is indoors.", "comment_date": "2021-04-28T04:39:41Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "B", "comment_text": "for the algorithm", "comment_date": "2021-04-27T11:15:42Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "realvanman1", "comment_text": "So... relative humidity is exactly what I\u2019ve always known it to be.
