Like books on a shelf, even a really big book shelf eventually fills up, and we need to take one off to fit another on. It makes sense to me that the human immune system would work in a similar way (though of course it might not, which is why I&#39;m asking!). Is our bookshelf of antibodies ever expanding/infinite? It makes sense to me too that books we don&#39;t read often/ever would fall off the shelf on their own, which explains the need for boosters. But how does getting the flu shot every year impact this? I know that getting a new flu shot doesn&#39;t push the measles book off the shelf, but why not? Do flu vaccines naturally fall off the shelf on their own in 3-5 years, making this not so important?
