This isn&#39;t always the case and people use this reasoning to not adopt from shelters. Also many breeders don&#39;t allow for enough genetic diversity and the dogs have health problems. I have a Prue bred German Shepherd who more often than not is missing huge chunks of hair because he is allergic to everything. We recently got him allergy tested again and have added grass, yes grass, to the long list. We have to buy special dog food for him because he is allergic to a lot of ingredients. We have to give him medication regularly to help with the arthritis in his hips . He is ageing poorly considering he is seven and my mom had a lab mutt of about the same size and he lived to be eighteen and was healthy as a horse till a week before his death. I really hope this study doesn&#39;t go to furthering breeding more dog with health problems. It&#39;s hard to see your dog suffer and I know some breeders will put down unhealthy pups who have it worse than my dog.", "comment_date": "2021-06-15T04:58:51Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Rose Bishop", "comment_text": "I have an auditory processing disorder and I find I accidentally interrupt people or think someone else has interrupted me when they haven&#39;t all the time.

They are the muttiest mutts that ever did mutt. Seriously, you look at any one of them and there are only vague hints at what breeds they&#39;re made up of. We thought maybe we&#39;d be able to tell when they got older but nope. Almost two years old and people see everything from Lab to Aussie Shep to a bully breed.
