Even if chimps eat meat (and they love it when they can get it) it\u2019s very sporadic. Meat is key to the story. <br>\r<br>Human ancestors may have begun as scavengers when their habitat turned into savannah, but turned into full blown hunters (and our bodies can be described as long-distance walker and runner and an object-throwing upper body: Chimps can\u2019t do it the way humans do it, no matter what). <br>\r<br>And meat is incredibly nutritious and requires (relatively) low processing, different from the continuous foraging for food by herbivores and the need to large bowels needed to extract as much nutritional value from the greens (that is manifested on the relative-to-size huge bellies in chimps and gorillas). <br><br>A powerful brain COULD evolve then that such restriction was lifted (compared for example to chimps who simply kept on going with their mainly plant based strategy or limitations). Obviously there are other dynamics for such evolution but here we touch mainly the food one. <br>\r<br>Thus, humans became fully omnivores but with meat becoming a winning and defining factor compared to ANY other primate on record. Meat means a huge reward, coming from a big animal hunt, whose meat could be eaten by the whole group and the NEED to share, while Chimps and Bonobos simply eat on location.  Each hunt was spaced with the next one (as it was not like every expedition was a successful one but if lucky the reward was huge. But this meant you needed to store that huge energy surplus while living on the meager non-meat resources of the savannah. <br>\r<br>So, human ancestors needed such capacity to store the sporadic huge rewards of meat, after hunting. What distort our diets today is that they are not cut with the forced fasting that our ancestors endured, leading therefore to obesity (of course coupled with lack of activity etc.).", "comment_date": "2021-12-10T13:56:19Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Smooth Smoker", "comment_text": "Orangutans \ud83e\udda7 are way fatter!!

Humans are the offshoot of the great apes ancestor that became semi-aquatic.  We have less body hair to be more hydrodynamic, we have more fat to keep warm in water and increase buoyancy (just like seals, otters, beavers and cetaceans), our hands and feet are fin-shaped with slightly webbed fingers and toes and most important of all, we have hooded noses that allow us to keep water out of our lungs while submerged. <br><br>We have less muscle mass because muscles are dense and would make us less buoyant more muscles aren&#39;t a very useful adaptation when a lot of your time is spent in the water.  Also, with the water holding us up, we don&#39;t NEED to have the same muscle mass as any terrestrial animal to get around.  It&#39;s not just other apes that are stronger than us, it&#39;s pretty much all terrestrial creatures.  Pound-for-pound, it&#39;s just the truth, we&#39;re terrestrial weaklings.<br><br><br>Our intelligence is far greater than that of our terrestrial and arboreal brethren but that could also be used as evidence of our aquatic nature.  After all, with the exception of humans, the most intelligent mammals in the world tend to exist in the water.  Dolphins and Whales of all kinds are well-known to be both extremely intelligent and also altruistic.  Otters know how to use tools to break shellfish and beavers are natural engineers.  Something about being a complex aquatic lifeform seems to create advanced intelligence.  The octopus is another example of this.  They are so intelligent that it&#39;s downright freaky.  Now, sure, not all aquatic life is intelligent because most fish are dumb as rocks but sea snakes, eels, rays and sharks have been shown to be pretty smart in their own right as well.<br><br>The other big piece of evidence is where humans are the naturally the most dangerous of apes.  If we were to have to fight another ape to the death we&#39;d be screwed if the battlefield was on land against a gorilla, bonobo or chimpanzee.  We&#39;d be screwed if we had to face an orangutan or gibbon in the trees.  However, none of those apes would stand a chance against an average human in deep water if the human knew how to swim.  Some chimpanzees can swim but it&#39;s kind of a heads-up breast-stroke because they can&#39;t submerge their heads.  Their noses would immediately begin to flood their lungs if this were to happen.  If an ape wanted to kill you and followed you into deep water, they wouldn&#39;t see tomorrow.  <br><br>A human could suberge so the other ape couldn&#39;t see, hear or smell them anymore.  Then the human could dive down below the ape&#39;s feet and drag it under.  By keeping below the ape opponent, the human would negate any chance of the ape trying to grab them.  The ape wouldn&#39;t want to reach down because down is not the direction that they&#39;d be desperate to go as they fought for air.  If the human held on just enough to keep the ape from surfacing, the ape would lose that struggle and drown.  <br><br>Even if you released the ape and it managed to re-surface (doubtful because they&#39;re so much more dense than humans), it would have water in its lungs already.  This would sap its strength and ability to think.  Have you ever had water in your lungs?  Yeah, try to tread water like that, good luck.  Since the ape would have to expend far more energy than you to avoid sinking because of its higher density, it would eventually run out of stamina and drown.  That 20-30 seconds that the average human can hold its breath underwater without any adverse effects would be a lethal weapon against any species of ape if fighting in deep water.<br><br>When it comes to where apes are at their best, gorillas, bonobos and chimpanzees rule the land, orangutans and gibbons rule the trees, and we rule the waves.  Surviving in water is our unique adaptation, something that no other ape can match.  We move as gracefully through the water as a gibbon does through the trees.
