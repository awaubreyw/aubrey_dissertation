It eats your food when it is left out in the kitchen or dining area and after about 4 hours there is enough of its toxic poop on your food to make you sick. So drinking wine will NOT prevent food poisoning. You would have to pour the wine over your food ever half hour or so to slow it down. Rule of thumb is that if food has been been left out for 4 hours it is covered with Salmonella poop and should be discarded. Don&#39;t try to cheat by eating food that&#39;s been left out longer than that and washing it down with a drink. If you are travelling, though, for example in Mexico or elsewhere where the tap water contains bacteria that you are not accustomed to then mixing in some wine will kill the bacteria and make it safe:   &quot;Stop drinking only water, and use a little wine because of your stomach and your frequent illnesses.&quot; - 1 Timothy <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JcOHClVQpTc&amp;t=5m23s\">5:23</a> (from the Bible)", "comment_date": "2017-12-20T23:29:47Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "iluvpinkandgold", "comment_text": "See I&#39;m not an alcoholic I&#39;m healthy! \ud83d\ude02", "comment_date": "2017-12-20T16:50:21Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Buster Jones", "comment_text": "It&#39;s kinda hard to die optimistic when there&#39;s phonies lying dead on the pavement, please, if you can hear me man, it&#39;s hard to make amends but I&#39;m losing my closest homies and friends.", "comment_date": "2017-12-20T08:40:22Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "James Drury", "comment_text": "Sponsored by Budweiser", "comment_date": "2017-12-19T21:23:15Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Aaron Vice", "comment_text": "Half true", "comment_date": "2017-12-19T13:57:35Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Brandon Diaz", "comment_text": "A straight shot of vodka is 40% ass. <br>However...tequila is 40% bad ass. <br>Tequila is life.

There are, after all, multiple different types of gut bacteria. Some gut bacteria, like Clostridium Difficile, is part of helpful gut bacteria. But all gut bacteria tend to average out others, like the checks and balances of our government are supposed to do. When certain kinds of bacteria die off, other kinds go crazy and can cause illness like the diarrhea of C. Diff infection. We have C. Diff naturally but when things like antibiotics kill off a lot of the C. Diff. controlling bacteria, C. Diff. diarrhea can be the result. <br><br>I work as nurse at a hospital on the Medical/Surgical unit where we often admit patients for C. Diff. infections. Sad to say, us nurses can simply take a whiff and look at stool after someone has had a bowel movement and tell if they have C. Diff. (or a gastrointestinal bleed) and tell if their gut is working right. <br><br>As a nurse, the stressors of my job have lead to me (and several coworkers) to be borderline alcoholics. I have noticed that after to much alcohol consumption,  my gut is not happy at all. I really believe that the alcohol kills off some bacteria but causes some to over-produce. Please pardon the nurse-isms here but, I often notice after a lot of alcohol intake, my BM&#39;s are fairly loose and with a bad smell. If I take a probiotic, (to repopulate my gut with good, regulating bacteria) my gut goes back to normal. <br><br>Some times, working in the medical field is more fruitful if you pay attention to your own body and put yourself in the position of the patient.
