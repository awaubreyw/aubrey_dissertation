For instance, figuring out a man&#39;s flow rate per unit volume might help with prostate issue diagnosis. I wish there was also a way to use this to help those with incontinence issues, particularly women (including a family member of mine), whose apparatus often gets deranged following pregnancies. If we could figure out a safe way to put a kink in their hoses, perhaps with a wearable pressure device, that could save them hundreds of dollars in incontinence products, as well as the embarrassment of lingering odor. Can we invent a women&#39;s pad with a lump in it that wouldn&#39;t be uncomfortable, and yet would allow them to control things in a more normal fashion? Or perhaps surgically introduce a gel pack, similar to artificial breast material, with just enough pressure to prevent unintended releases? Would that be like a lump, or would it need to be circular, with the urethra snipped and sewn back together after threading through it? For that matter, that might help some men as well. Perhaps a tiny, surgically implanted clamp, that would only open at a specific pressure, then would close when not having said pressure applied, but not close so tightly so as to affect blood supply? Perhaps one with an external, electronic control, so they could operate it intentionally, but which wouldn&#39;t be able to stay closed if they waited too long? Because obviously, someone could damage their kidneys if they tried to hold it in too long, or forgot to use it, due to dementia.", "comment_date": "2021-05-23T05:06:21Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "jaeD sixx66", "comment_text": "Wrong....there\u2019s a video of a dog pissing for 90 seconds straight", "comment_date": "2021-04-05T13:21:54Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Jessica Evans", "comment_text": "Dude, math or no math, seeing it or not, I could tell you that horses release more urine per second than a human does.", "comment_date": "2021-01-27T06:31:21Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Bethany Karasek", "comment_text": "I watched this when you first uploaded it and since then I have been counting my long pees.
