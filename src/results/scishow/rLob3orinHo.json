My treatment was a great success, he healed me just as he promised. he sent me his medication and ask me to go for check up after one weeks of taking the medication. i agreed with him i took this medication and went for check up, to my greatest surprise my result was negative after the treatment, i am really happy that i am cured and healthy again..

Not only are they waaay too different anatomically, but they can get away with regeneration because they have so many redundant organs and a body built to handle dismemberment.  Of course they can get away with losing an arm, a heart, or part of their brain, because all of their organs either have replacements or are decentralized.  That allows them to continue operating without any major functional loss.  Meanwhile, their lack of skeleton and just overall squishy body allows different parts of their lost organs to regrow at different rates without complication.", "comment_date": "2020-08-30T23:01:36Z", "likes_count": 18}, {"comment_by": "Noah Villanueva", "comment_text": "couldn&#39;t have waited the extra 32 days for October?", "comment_date": "2020-08-30T23:00:53Z", "likes_count": 6}, {"comment_by": "Mads Bachmann", "comment_text": "could be fun to have an octopus in an aquarium but I know they are very demanding in habitat and so on", "comment_date": "2020-08-30T22:56:34Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Mike, from Texas", "comment_text": "I&#39;ve always wondered, when y&#39;all say Octopuses can &quot;change their texture&quot;, do you mean that literally?
