I had to spend the night in the SICU, five more nights in the hospital then go to a heart clinic for an electrophysiological examination.<br>It turned out my heart can conduct signals where it shouldn&#39;t and it can trigger a supraventricular tachycardia. There&#39;s a fix for that, but there was an 80% chance that I&#39;d need a pacemaker if they tried, so for now it&#39;s out of the question. I have to be careful not to move in a way that might compress my chest, watch my breathing and not to be in a too humid environment (I don&#39;t know how&#39;s humidity connected but it is). Which meant avoiding exercise (which was hard because I was a body builder and a karateka), and ironically doing so just increased my risks of triggering it because I gained a lot of weight.
