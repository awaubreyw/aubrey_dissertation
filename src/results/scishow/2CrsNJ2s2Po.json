It would have been better to say &quot;severe HIV infection&quot; AND then state that a count &lt; 200 is a critical juncture wherein opportunistic infections start to increase significantly because the immune system is impaired.

Still, to be precise these proteins are used more for cell lineage markers. So cytokeratins (of which there are more than 20 different types) are used to identify epithelial cells; all epithelial cells in the body express some sort of cytokeratin and, usually, carcinomas  (although not all) which come from epithelium tend to express them. Vimentin for the other part is more inespecific but generally is used to identify mesenquimal cells and the tumors derived from them, so sarcomas. It is a bit of a simplification because there are sarcomas that don&#39;t express vimentin and some express cytokeratins and there are carcinomas that express vimentin and not keratins, but as a rule of thumb keratin for epithelial cells (also carcinomas) and vimentin for mesenquimal cells (also sarcomas). To further complicate matters there are neoplasma that are not epithelial nor mesenquimal such as lymphomas or melanomas.

A DNA test for amoebas, slime molds, and fungi turned up a surprising match-it&#39;s actually tapeworm DNA.
