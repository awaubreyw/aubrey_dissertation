I find the overall message of this video and the timing for it to come out right now. When recently people have been attacking a feral buildings, trying to burn them down with federal officers inside. The officers have been defending the building and their lives with nonlethal tools such as tear gas/ rubber bullets. Thats been going on in Seattle for the last two weeks. And it just so happens that all major media outlets paint them as completely peaceful and consisting of mothers and children and veterans. Both violent riots and peaceful protests happen, and some individuals may even &quot;peacefully protest&quot; among violent rioters. That doesn&#39;t make it right to ignore the political violence set force by the far left, antifa, BLM, and claim that the reality. When any group, these I just named, or others say a Neonazi group or KKK group, organize in groups and execute violent crimes they need to be shut down. End of story. It doesn&#39;t matter who it is, and the law enforcement needs the tools to do the job as safely as possible. Unfortunately better options don&#39;t exist as Micheal says in the video. Instead of giving the police less nonlethal options how about we invest more into the training of the officers in this country, and make it mandatory for them to consistently train throughout the career.", "comment_date": "2020-08-09T23:29:22Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "_Vallee _", "comment_text": "Getting tear gassed in the eyes feel as though you are going to die, your eyes begin to tear, and you start seeing the world in blur, your eyes start to water up and burn as though somebody had taken Tabasco sauce and rubbed it all over your eyes, and your eyes flood with tears.

Extreme discomfort, and my eyes burned, but after a few moments the coughing stopped and was just replaced with the burning sensation.  Sweating from the exercise burned my skin.  When I got out to fresh air, thats when the mucus and everything poured out, or at least you noticed it.  Don&#39;t wipe your face, don&#39;t touch your face; just flap your arms like a chicken.   It gets any excess gas out of your clothing, and encourages circulation of fresh air.  The ruck back hurt,, mostly because the sweat irritated the capsaicin.

We get trained and then we gear up and then head into a filled chamber of tear gas. You could see, but not well, maybe a few feet in front of you. It&#39;s like being in a room with Snoop Dogg, Willy Nelson, Cheech &amp; Chong during a smoke session. As the two trainees get up to being the next ones out, you are told you are to remove your face mask and hood, take a deep breath in and you are to state (and this varies depending on your instructor) your name and where you&#39;re from. The guy I was standing next to was from New Jersey and I&#39;m from Brooklyn. We remove our cover, take a deep breath in, and scream as loud as we can our name and where we&#39;re from and then proceed to walk out with our arms out so we don&#39;t touch our face (which would irritate the skin even more) and as we walked out we barely coughed. We had plenty of snot coming out and our eyes were watery, while some had it worse in the sense that they couldn&#39;t stop coughing with runny eyes and noses. It was crazy! One guy that was about 6&#39;7&quot; had the longest booger hanging from his face, almost went as far down as his mid-thigh (his nickname was Big Bird, I&#39;ll never forget) and it looked like a giant slug.
