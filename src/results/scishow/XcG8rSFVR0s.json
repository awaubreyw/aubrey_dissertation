The way in which glyphosate kills non-resistant plants, bacteria and fungi is by preventing an enzyme functioning that build\u2019s the organism\u2019s immune system - this is extremely similar to the way in which penecilin kills bacteria. Scientists found that some bacteria that were developing resistance to glyphosate were also developing resistance to anti-biotics!

These cells came from a dog thousands of years ago in the americas and its breed has long been extinct. This cancer acts like a single cellular organism and is the sole surviver of its species which is a breed of dog and lives on inside other dogs even though the &quot;dog&quot; is dead.<br><br>Thank you Trey for burdening me with this cursed fact.
