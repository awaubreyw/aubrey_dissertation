On the rare occasion we spot one(only 110 or so have been in the century or so since we discovered them!) They always have an Itty bitty fish called  Thalassobathia Pelagica.  I recall it being mentioned said fishy isn&#39;t found anywhere else(could be wrong on that and sadly no time to research \ud83d\ude22) its usually seen right up underneath the bell.  I find it intriguing how incredibly different from most jellies they are.  Almost like they are more evolved.  I suspect the relationship is the jellies offer a safe place to live and the fish rids them of parasites.  Its a bit vexing that despite having observed these deep sea behemoths(deepstaria, Stygiomedusa and big red...Tiburon?) We&#39;ve never really examined one it the lab.  That must be epically aggravating to biologists.  I recall the lady who invented the splat screen and jelly fish lure and pioneered research into bioluminescence. She also had a big hand in figuring out how to attract an arcateuthis dux.  During a submersible dive with the Monterey Bay folks she had the incredible luck to run into(almost literally!) A Stygiomedusa Gigantea.   It was so close they couldn&#39;t use thrusters and was only a few feet away from her.  She very well may be the only biologist to ever come so close.  They observed and photographed for a good bit of time.  Yet how frustrating that there is simply no way to capture one(well trawlers occasionally get one but that really tells nothing as they are pretty much nothing but a mangled ball of snot afterwards and can be hard to tell if it was even a jelly or if a whale sneezed...hmm can whales sneeze!?
