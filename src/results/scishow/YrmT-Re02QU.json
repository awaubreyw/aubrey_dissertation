Their differing Phenotype can confuse the fact they have similar genotypes to allow fertile (successful) interbreeding.<br>This is also the case with the American Ruddy Duck (invasive species) and mediterranean/Asian White-headed Duck (endangered) that were thought to be previously separate species.<br>Isn&#39;t this an example of adaptation (ecology) than evolution? as the suggestion that they could be classified as their own species as they become more genetically distinct overtime is a bit woolly as such events are supposed to take millions of years, When the speciation event occurs - this is would of course be more pronounce if the Coywolf itself was in genetic isolation as the continual interbreeding merely reinforces genetic compatibility and therefore non-speciation. <br>They could be classified as a separate subspecies if they are distinct enough so they are more taxonomy  Canis (genus). Latrans (Coyote - species) Lupi (wolf - subspecies) as opposed to a Canis Castellum (or something like that).<br>I Continue to enjoy watching Scishow and the myriad of interesting facts and myth busting :).
