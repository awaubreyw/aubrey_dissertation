The reasons why is that unless they have a clean energy power plant dedicated to them they&#39;re not even doing as well as if they were a hamster on a hamster wheel. The best way I can easily explain this is that it takes more energy and effort to extract CO2 from the atmosphere that to produce it. You are basically promoting a scam and I&#39;m not trying to be mean about this one but I&#39;m also correct about it because they can&#39;t do what you are saying unless they had a purpose built power plant for them that was 100% clean because if they draw any amount of energy from the grid at best they will do nothing and at worst they are actively harmful to the environment. This explanation is as follows,<br>* point one I pay them to sequester a given amount of CO2/carbon<br>* point two they start their plant that extracts the CO2/carbon from the atmosphere and that takes energy to make use of no matter how they do it.<br>* point three if any of the energy sources they use are from Fossil fuels they&#39;re actively contributing to the CO2/carbon emissions because of not just the higher energy costs of extraction but also because of energy loss during every step of the process the energy takes to get to the plant<br>* point four unless they are planting trees and 100% of their energy requirements are met by clean energy because of how much energy is required to extract the CO2/carbon they will be putting more into the atmosphere than they extract from the atmosphere. They are scamming you and I&#39;m sorry but it is true. I understand that you will need fossil fuels to produce the clean energy source no matter what it is, but I&#39;m not taking about that I&#39;m talking about the fact that they don&#39;t actually do anything important or even beneficial for the environment this is the same scam that was running years ago when there were these companies that were doing this round Robin where they were eliminating carbon in France and say creating it somewhere else like the UK but in truth all they were doing is creating more and more CO2 and other greenhouse emissions. Look up the spiffing brit and you will see part of what kind of scam this is.
