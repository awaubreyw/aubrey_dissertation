P.\r<br>Thermodynamics is used in many branches of science and human activity. Many researchers who are not professionally familiar with thermodynamics try to use this area of knowledge in their fields of activity. This is the main cause of many serious mistakes that quickly spread like a snowball in science. Thermodynamics uses the mathematical apparatus of total differentials and ideas about state functions. \r<br>State functions characterize equilibrium systems and, with an acceptable approximation, systems close to equilibrium, when it can be assumed that state functions have a real physical meaning. Systems that do not meet these criteria should not be considered thermodynamic. For example, systems far from equilibrium have no state functions. Processes occurring in these systems should not be described in terms of state functions. Thus, the thermodynamics of systems far from equilibrium I. Prigogine, in fact, is the kinetics using some non-thermodynamic entropy, which does not have a full differential.\r<br>Numerous errors are associated with misconceptions about thermodynamic entropy. Many of these errors are \u201cborn\u201d in the life sciences.\r<br>The term &quot;entropy&quot; coined Rudolf Clausius. According to his model of the world (universe), he presented a statement: &quot;The energy of the world is constant. The entropy of the world tends to the maximum&quot;. Later this statement was chosen by J. W. Gibbs as an epigraph to the paper &quot;On the Equilibrium of Heterogeneous Substances&quot;. These scientists have given this statement in relation to their model of the universe This model corresponds to a simple isolated system of ideal gas, i.e. isolated system of ideal gas, energy and volume of this system are constant and in which the work of expansion is performed only. Entropy of such a system can only increase! It should be noted that when we say on ideal model, which would correspond to the real universe, it would be necessary to accept the unreal assumption that any form of energy real universe will be transformed into thermal energy. Only in this case, also under additional unrealistic assumptions, the real universe &quot;would turn&quot; into the model of ideal system of Clausius - Gibbs. However, lovers of science have applied representations on simple systems to systems of other types, in which the interactions takes place between particles of different nature (interactions of molecules or other objects of different hierarchies) and to systems which interact with the environment. Some scientists, who are not professionals in the relevant fields of knowledge, have not escaped such errors. This has led to unimaginable confusion. This has slowed down the development of science, more than on a century. There are thousands of publications in scientific journals and popular literature containing marked misunderstandings. To these were added incorrect ideas on the negentropy and on the dissipative structures in the living world, and the false identification of &quot;the information entropy&quot; with the thermodynamic entropy. The origin of life and its evolution can be easily explained from the standpoint of hierarchical near equilibrium thermodynamics of complex dynamic systems. This thermodynamics is established on a solid foundation of equilibrium thermodynamics - thermodynamics of Rudolf Clausius, J. W. Gibbs and other great scientists.\r<br>It should also be noted that many non-professional authors use erroneous terminology. These errors are distributed in the literature, which creates incredible confusion. For example, the terms \u201cisolated system\u201d are sometimes replaced by the term \u201cclosed system\u201d and vice versa. Of course, from the standpoint of thermodynamics, this is completely unacceptable. \r<br>Another example of incorrect use of terms in thermodynamics is associated with the concepts of \u201csimple thermodynamic system\u201d and \u201ccomplex thermodynamic system\u201d. A simple system in thermodynamics is a system in which either no work is done or only the work of expansion is performed. A complex system in thermodynamics is a system in which not only the work of expansion is performed.\r<br>A serious misunderstanding is connected with the identification of the concepts of thermodynamic entropy and the Shannon informational entropy. The meaning of these concepts is completely different Nevertheless, now some researchers are trying to refute this assertion.\r<br>These comments relate to the majority of articles devoted to the second law and entropy in Wikipedia. Apparently, many of these articles need to be refined or revised.\r<br>\r<br>References\r<br>Gladyshev G.P.
