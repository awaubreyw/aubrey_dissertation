We\u2019ve lied, we\u2019ve stolen, we\u2019ve sinned sexually, and we\u2019ve taken His name in vain; which makes us liars, thieves, fornicators and blasphemers.. Yet this is only four of our many transgressions.<br><br>The problem is, we can never \u2018outweigh\u2019 our sin with good deeds because God is perfect in Holiness, meaning his standard is beyond our reach. He is also perfect in Justice, meaning, he will bring EVERY sin to light. The punishment for our sin is death, and Hell; a place of Eternal Fire, where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth.<br><br>Fortunately God is also perfect in Love, so 2000 years ago, Jesus Christ left his throne in heaven and came to this earth. While here, he lived a perfectly righteous life, only to take the punishment that We deserved; Our sinless creator became Our sin, and endured a gruesome death on a cross for our sake. <br>Right before he died, he said \u2018it is finished\u2019.. meaning, the debt for our sins has been paid in full. And on the third day, he conquered death and rose from the grave. So now, we can go free from the wrath of God\u2019s judgement not by earning it, but rather, as a free gift of grace ;<br><br>Except a gift can either be accepted or rejected..So this is what you must do in response; <br><br>Humbly admit to God that you have sinned against him, and through gratitude in the sacrifice of his son, repent (turn away) from your old way of life. Then, confess with your mouth that Jesus Christ is Lord, your savior, and the ruler of your life from this moment forward (Romans 10:9). <br><br>Do these things, and you will be saved.<br><br>If you do so sincerely, God will grant you a new heart which no longer finds comfort in sin. He will also grant you Eternal life in his presence; The greatest pleasure on earth doesn\u2019t even come close to what God is preparing for believers in the afterlife. <br><br>You\u2019ve been informed; Now the choice is yours. What you do with this information will determine where you spend ETERNITY, meaning, this is the single most critical decision you will EVER make; And all of us here, whether believer or atheist, know deep down that every last word here is true .<br><br>Jesus Christ awaits YOU this very moment; don\u2019t even think about sleeping tonight until you surrender your life to him, because your tomorrow isn\u2019t guaranteed.. And as it is written (Hebrews 9 : 27) ;<br><br>\u2018It is appointed unto man ONCE to die, but after this, THE JUDGMENT\u2019 .<br><br>All glory, honor and praise to Lord Jesus Christ.<br><br><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/1432117742/ref=emc_b_5_mob_i\">https://www.amazon.com/dp/1432117742/ref=emc_b_5_mob_i</a>", "comment_date": "2021-01-05T22:20:22Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Existenceisillusion", "comment_text": "Wondering just how much Brilliant really teaches about neural networks.
