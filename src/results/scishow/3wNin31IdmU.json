In other words, Autism isn&#39;t caused by vaccines but in sensitive individuals, all auto immune responses can tip them into an inflamed state that can later lead to autistic regression.<br>Combined with the fact that the most effective H2 and H3 blockers work through methylation and that gut issues lead to lower intrinsic factor, these individuals may have trouble absorbing B12 in their diet.

I took mirtazapine for some time and wondered why my motion sickness was gone (I experienced it when I played 1st person games). I was baffled. After some research, I found that a) the trigger of motion sickness is too many histamines, b) vitamin c can help with combating symptoms and c) around 80% of the effects from mirtazapine actually come from blocking histamine receptors, which is why it is used as a sleeping aid (mostly off-label). From there on, I was intrigued. I contacted one of the professors researching histamine intolerance and he confirmed that mirtazapine can help with motion sickness. In his book he also described that deaths related to drug abuse often comes from anaphylaxis (too much histamine) triggered by the drug.<br><br>A fee years ago, I was admitted to the hospital because of heart palpitations. I was worried that I got some of the heart conditions that run in my family. Luckily, I was perfectly healthy, however, I was still experiencing palpitations. Turns out, palpitations can be a symptom of histamine intolerance and can be treated by giving high doses of antihistamines! Histamine intolerance has sooo many symptoms and it is so little known about.<br><br>It&#39;s so interesting and there is still so much to learn! By the way, motion sickness is a stress reaction and stress triggers the release of histamine from the mast cells, which is why vitamin c helps. It helps metabolizing the histamine!<br><br>Also, too much histamine in your body can trigger ADHD-like symptoms! It can also go the other way around: Suspiciously, a lot of autistic people have GI issues. I personally believe it comes from the realease of histamine because autistic people deal with a lot of stress in their lives. I wouldn&#39;t be surprised if the role of antihistamines in the treatment of psychological conditions gets bigger and more important in the future and as a psychology student I am really excited about it!

I don\u2019t take any stims for it. (Besides caffeine, which is pretty norma and safel.) The symptoms however are still there. Which include the anxiety/depression/extreme negative emotion generally.
