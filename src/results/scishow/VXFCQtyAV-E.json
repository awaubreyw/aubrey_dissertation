I was going through the day, waiting until I got hungry, and then it was dinnertime and all I had was coffee and vitamin water. I have to force myself to eat, which hurts my stomach and makes me sick, because my body is telling me, &quot;No, you&#39;re full, stop eating.&quot; I even went to my doctor, fearing this was a serious issue, they ran tests, I had two ultrasounds, etc. Nothing.
