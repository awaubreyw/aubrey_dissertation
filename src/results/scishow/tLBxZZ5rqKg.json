Sound propagating from the inside to the the outside of the spinning borophene wheel should launch the nuclear fuel itself into something spinning the other direction to amplify it\u2019s force. Any projectile can be accelerated by resonant sound more efficiently than any other approach. Just a thought. I will rant for ages if I don\u2019t stop here. Peace.<br><br> Thank you, and sorry for wasting your time, but I am nothing at all. Just a guy that is utterly interested in fusion, merely because I feel like sonic resonance is highly unexplored. Mechanical vibration can shake apart anything. I mean, if something is already heated to fusion level, then shaking the crap out of it ought to separate it again for complete fission. A.I. can calculate, and monitor, the correct frequency and amplitude.<br><br>After learning the truth that you can only really expect .01 percent Q factor from fusion lead me to think, whoa, fusion can make hydrogen into even the heaviest element, and then fission can reduce it back down to hydrogen. But of course, how? It\u2019s okay that lasers are so energy intensive because if you don\u2019t use the energy such a portable propulsion system uses, the whole thing would melt, or arc out in every direction like a spider of plasma. <br><br>The borophene lattice confinement material made they way I was suggesting in the last comment, is an original approach, but will definitely absolutely deliver the desired product without fail. The 2 giant hexagonal shaped plates of tungsten would only come together to one atom thick. They can\u2019t squeeze any further than that or they would have to smash atoms. The boron atoms can be powdered down to single atoms by essentially melting it and spraying it through a nozzle into a vacuum. Actually, two nozzles that focus the beams of boron directly at each other to break it into single atoms, plus sound.<br><br>Once the powder is sprinkled on the very smooth, even metallic glassified, surface of the tungsten plates, the plates resonate with sound that only has enough amplitude to separate the boron atoms. The 2 plates will come together only one atom apart. Then a border around the 2 plates will be put around it to keep the boron powder in the device so that once electricity arcs between the 2 plates, and the boron turns to confined plasma, it can\u2019t escape.<br><br>Once it becomes plasma in a fraction of a nanosecond, sound reverberates through the 2 plates. The plates are shaped like large hexagons so that resonance forms a lattice of tiny hexagons in the plasma. &quot;If&quot; necessary, magnetic field lines can also guide the hexagonal lattice of the boron plasma. If there is too much powder in the device so that cavities don\u2019t form to make the lattice, then you have to back up and increase the amplitude of the sound that separated the powder on the plates.<br><br>Eventually you will discover the frequency, and the amplitude to have the exact right amount of powder in there to start with. When it turns into plasma, it will be larger, or more expanded, so it\u2019s much easier to find the correct sonic frequency. Once it collapses into a solid borophene film, it will be little tiny, so you have to start with giant tungsten plates. The tungsten will have to be resurface every so often, and when melted, it will bubble over the top a little. So spun slightly in a centrifuge the surface will become curved the other way. So, the speed of the centrifuge has to be correct also. Or, you can make slightly curved sheets of borophene that is a tiny bit weaker than if it was flat.<br><br>Sonic resonance may be required to make the tungsten plates perfectly flat. Once you have a stack of borophene sheets, you compress them, and flash bond them together with a flash of ultra high voltage, and super low amperage. This will fuse them into a structural brick to make the lattice confinement material to hold the hydrogen, or heavy hydrogen. From there, you use fine but powerful lasers to cut, carve, and shape it into a torus, or flash bond it into a torus.<br><br>Fusion occurs as this torus spins in a circle. At one spot in the circle as it spins, lasers, magnetic induction on the boron (assuming induction will work on boron), and maybe electricity, converge on a single focused spot and excite the hydrogen, and ignite fusion of the hydrogen into heavier elements. Weight on that side of the spinning torus just seems to appear out of nowhere. It\u2019s unbelievably hot for a fraction of a nanosecond, and that\u2019s when sonic resonance of a specific frequency meets from 2 opposing directions, and instant fission occurs, reducing it all of the way back down to hydrogen.<br><br>Actually, the sound for fission comes from the top and bottom of the spinning torus on the fission side. Many, many, locations does the sound come from. A chain of locations. Each succeeding location will induce a slightly higher frequency because the torus will loose temperature as it spins. How fast does the torus spin? Just beyond the speed of sound.<br><br>The unique feature of this type of propulsion is the craft it is in will get continuously faster, and might even break the speed limit. Eliminating G-forces is a whole other topic to be discussed later. I\u2019m going to write a second comment to you after this to see what you think.

I&#39;m not saying they should always go through a list of every idea someone&#39;s ever had for ways to generate power through fusion, but just acknowledging the concept that it isn&#39;t necessarily the only game in town would be nice. Like, &quot;One of the methods scientists are trying to use is the Tokamak&quot; really doesn&#39;t add a lot of words, and someone better at editing could surely trim that down without losing the concept that there are alternatives out there, like a stellarator, or inertial confinement, just to pull a couple off the top of my  head. It&#39;s not just articles about tokamaks that do this, but one about a stellarator project, for instance, tends to at least acknowledge the difference between them and tokamaks, since &quot;what they do better than a tokamak&quot; is an important reason for their existence.<br><br>Second, &quot;Fusion Energy.&quot; It often gets talked about in such a way that it sounds like it&#39;s some special flavor of energy, as if there&#39;s something qualitatively different about electricity that comes from that source (the same occasionally goes for &quot;solar energy&quot;), rather than just being a better, cleaner alternative way of generating plain vanilla electricity.

ITER will at least be tackling issues of tritium breeding for sustainability models, but ITER is massive and nothing more than a proof of concept at that size. Both ITER and JET are using <i>oldschool</i> magnet coils made of braided wire. The SPARC reactor project is not only tackling tritium breeding, but they&#39;re using magnet coils made with high-temp superconducting wire that is able to create vastly more powerful magnets. They&#39;re building coils with the magnetic strength of ITER... at a quarter of the size. <br><br>Size is super important to the progress of fusion energy. Heck, it&#39;s been a major roadblock of <i>all</i> forms of nuclear energy. Even if ITER succeeds, someone is gonna have to design a version that investors can AFFORD and won&#39;t take thirty years to build. Because of its size and complexity, ITER had to design and build everything in-house, starting with the wires for their coils. Meanwhile High-Temperature Superconductors already have a number of industrial uses and are currently being mass-produced as an off-the-rack part. That makes modern reactor parts very cost effective to build and maintain.<br><br>ITER: <br>Radius: 6.2m<br>Field Strength: 11.8T (maximum)<br>Expected Q ratio (energy return vs energy in): ~10 <br><br>SPARC:<br>1.85m<br>Field Strength: 12T (operating) / 20T (maximum)<br>Expected Q ratio: ~11<br><br>That&#39;s a massive difference. I&#39;m pretty psyched to see how that project plays out in the coming years. If their project timeline remains on schedule, they may even be officially unveiling their reactor around the same time as ITER in 2025. That&#39;s <i>right</i> around the corner. If ITER&#39;s design proves that fusion can work, and SPARC is able to replicate it at a fraction of the size... then holy crap that is gonna be a BIG win for fusion energy. I think a lot of people would rather see a video on this, as well as how all the frontrunner designs compare with one another.

It did Crank out a huge supply of Ph.D&#39;s. Fusion simply doesn&#39;t work as a technology.<br><br>    The Quantities of deuterium/tritium; though abundant require huge manufacturing facilities that industry simply hasn&#39;t adopted or built yet.<br><br>    Tritium has to bred in fission nuclear reactors in large amounts, thus still needs lots of reactors round the clock to produce barely a few Kilograms a year.<br><br>    Technology still doesn&#39;t break even.<br><br>    Despite it&#39;s claims it doesn&#39;t produce radioactive waste; it doesn&#39;t produce solid wastes, it does produce HUGE amounts of radiation and gaseous radioactivity. The Sun is 93 million miles away, still produces enough radiation to give you cancer and severe eye damage.<br><br>Fusion is difficult because the mass needed to fuse per second is huge. In nature GRAVITY does the work of coalescing gaseous material into a ball and keeping it into a ball. According to scientists stellar ignition requires a mass 70x greater than Jupiter; 6.4% the Sun&#39;s mass<br>(converting a quarter million tons of fuel per second) Humans cant generate gravity; so we substitute higher temps 100-1000x the temp of typical star cores, this results in a plasma temp too unstable to be dense enough to even use. 100-1000x less dense, it&#39;s less energetic.<br>Plus hydrogen nuclei don&#39;t like to merge, as they share the same charge, they deflect alot. So it takes enormous amounts of pressure and energy to FORCE hydrogen nucleus to interact. To sum up fusion Think of a miniature Golf Course. In this case the hill or Volcano hole. The Ball<br>is one hydrogen nucleus, the HOLE is the target atom, the volcano mound is the scattering affect of alike charges. You cant steer the ball, you have to have enough balls over and over again. And you need enough energy/temp to get it up the hill.

There&#39;s a hundred million holes all over the field (Uranium density), Temperature is 1000x lesser, Containment is irrelevant (except to protect you), the balls are moving slowly and every time a ball goes in<br>the hole 2-3 more balls come out.<br><br>Fusion is so hard we worked on it for 70 years, still doesn&#39;t work, Army of Ph.D scientists, engineers....Petaflop scale super computers, Machines that costs tens of billions of dollars and they still haven&#39;t produced anything resembling break even.

Fusion reactors are super cool science toys that do serve a purpose, but energy production to power your home isn\u2019t it.

Always.  It will always range from problems on the integrity of the containment vessel being able to withstand the immense heat and neutron activation, needing constant expensive maintenance at unsustainable intervals.  Then there is the problem of just sustaining the reaction.  You can\u2019t just add fuel like in a car to keep the reaction of combustion going.  Not a great analogue, but think of a fusion reactor like a \u201cboiler\u201d of sorts.  The pressure and temperature needs to be maintained with extreme precision under extreme conditions.  How are you introduce fuel in a controlled matter that keeps the reaction going?  It would be somewhat like adding cold water to that \u201cboiler\u201d the conditions change rapidly and you lose \u201csteam\u201d instead in this case \u201ccold\u201d fuel being introduced would nix the reaction.

This was expected to prevent tritium from becoming trapped in the walls, however it makes controlling the plasma more difficult as impurities from the wall have a major effect on performance. Note: tritium is radioactive and there will be a strict limit on the amount onsite at ITER, if it&#39;s in the walls, it&#39;s not able to be used in the reaction. What&#39;s GREAT is that, not only did they increase the fusion energy produced since the &#39;97 experiment, but they are also saying the tritium retention issue is much better with the new tiles!
