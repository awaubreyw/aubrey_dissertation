An airplane&#39;s skin isn&#39;t thick enough for a magnetic field that strong to attract it strongly enough to lift the whole airplane because not enough magnetic field can saturate the volume of the skin. It&#39;s also the reason why big (and super strong) neodymium magnets can&#39;t stick to fridge doors much more powerfully than smaller neo magnets. The thin steel doors saturate and the excess magnetic field can&#39;t do anything. :D<br><br>But in the spirit of what Hank Green said, let&#39;s say we have a mass of something ferromagnetic (iron, nickel, cobalt, whatever; we basically need something that will happily stick to our magnet) equivalent to that of an airplane, and this is a solid mass with tons of volume for field saturation capacity, then it&#39;ll totally stick to said magnet and be lifted right up. :)", "comment_date": "2019-01-04T23:31:02Z", "likes_count": 69}, {"comment_by": "Aukush", "comment_text": "That&#39;s how you make black holes.. =)", "comment_date": "2019-01-04T23:28:38Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Muscle Hank", "comment_text": "I should have made the list for my invaluable contributions to the field of bro-science.", "comment_date": "2019-01-04T23:28:36Z", "likes_count": 152}, {"comment_by": "John Smith", "comment_text": "Hi Henk!
