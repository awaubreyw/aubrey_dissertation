Not 8 cups specifically, just drink water when you\u2019re thirsty, make sure you\u2019re hydrated. <br>Exercise as much as you feel comfortable with. Whether it be an hour of walking, some strength training, the like, just make sure to not overdo it. <br>Get plenty of sleep. Sleep is good for you.<br>Do your stretches. It just helps with stiffness and keeps you limber. <br>And ask your doctor if you want to change your lifestyle, or even to see if things need changes. That\u2019s the most important thing to do.<br>And to top it all off, don\u2019t be hard on yourself. You can be disciplined without hating on yourself, and resenting yourself for not changing fast enough or missing one day isn\u2019t good for you. Believe in yourself, pace yourself, and you\u2019ll get there. It\u2019s not a race, it\u2019s not a competition.

What I mean is, there is NO food today that you can consume, raw out of the woods or otherwise that is anything like nutrient wise what our ancestors ate.<br>It&#39;s not a bad idea, but man it&#39;s just ignorant of how much things have changed, mostly due to human influence in all the foods we eat. Everything is bigger, sweeter and has more flesh for us to consume.<br><br>I eat 1000-1200 cals a day, because I am obese and can handle that big of a loss. My doctor approves because my mental health is absolutely terrible and it&#39;s a trigger for me to lose just a little bit all the time to keep going. I take a iron supplement and a multivitamin because 1000 is not enough to get everything in, it just isn&#39;t. But considering my size, age and all that, losing is a better option, even if it&#39;s not the healthiest way to do so, because I can&#39;t keep to anything else and I had my gall bladder removed, so Keto is no longer an option.<br>I lost 11 kilos in a little over 4 months.<br>I also work out a few times a week for about 20-30 minutes, sometimes just ten. Some weeks, it&#39;s nothing, because consistency is the bane of my existence, but I shoot for at least once a week of dedicated exercise, beyond any places I need to go.<br>I&#39;ve been off since then due to a depression spell for over a month and have gained 3.5 kilos back, much of which is likely water weight and bulk in my intestines and some of course is actual fat gain, because I have no been able to have any will in cravings. It&#39;s very frustrating to diet when you have bad mental health. Everyday is a crap-shoot on if you can keep on it or not. So when I am on it, I have a cheat day, or meal once a week, or once a month, depending on my ability to fight cravings. So I&#39;m an advocate of doing what works for you even if it&#39;s not the healthiest option, but still approved by a health professional.<br><br>For everyone else under the sun, moderation of everything is ALWAYS key. Do what makes you feel good. A little muscle burn is fine. Feeling like your muscles are going to explode is not. When trying to gain, go until the last few reps make you feel like you can&#39;t do anymore. There should be some work out pain, as it&#39;s an indicator of micro-tears in the muscle, which will rebuild and grow stronger and basically inflate (that&#39;s what makes muscles big, they don&#39;t actually change in size, and you can&#39;t build new muscle, your improve what you have already.)<br>Same with food. Some people can quit cold turkey, some do it slowly, others have a total relapse if they so much as eat a square of chocolate. So finding out which one you are and what your trigger foods are can help a LOT.<br>Candy is my trigger food, ice cream is fine for me in moderation. Every night I ate 100 grams of a no sugar ice cream and allotted the calories for it. Some people can handle having one slice of pizza instead of having to learn to make a new healthier lower calorie recipe. Most need to find a substitute though as they can&#39;t have one slice and feel worse and more cravings after.<br><br>Find what works for you and what your doctor approves of if you have any existing conditions that bar you from doing a typical CICO diet, like if keto works, if high carb works, if certain exercises help keep you more stable, etc etc. If you can find vices you can wiggle in that don&#39;t throw you off track. A couple of squares of chocolate and one table spoon of peanut butter is a common one as a late night snack for lots of people. One of my favorites was milk with one drop of stevia and some frozen mangos with some small bite size pieces of chocolate mixed in. The milk would freeze a little and become frosty and icy. Really helped cover a craving for cold, sweet and chocolate while also covering a fruit craving too. I weighed everything and was quite happy with it before I found the no sugar ice cream.

First simply cutting calories is not going to cut it and will in fact contribute to the yo-yo effect Michael was talking about. It causes rebound effects as people will often begin binge cycles. The body releases cortisol because it literally thinks your starving, this results in poor mood, irregular sleep, fatigue, and on and on all of which tend to drive you toward comfort foods, the very foods you are trying to avoid <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3014770/\">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3014770/</a>. That&#39;s why the Paleo and Vegan and Carnivore, and all these other diets were started in the first place. They all have one thing in common and that is cut out all the processed crap. Primarily oils and sugars. Now going hungry is not the problem, which you will find linked sources below for that (in fact it may help you feel full faster to go through bouts of CONTROLLED fasting). Chronic calorie restriction below your normal consumption, however, will lead to feelings of starvation. Which is why most of the diets I mentioned above don&#39;t start you off cutting your calories, you are supposed to eat until full. What you will find is that there are so many fewer calories in what your eating that you will get full and be eating less calories anyway. <br><br>The amount of exercise you would have to do to lose weight directly gets into the territory that Michael is trying to avoid as well. Exercise does come with benefits but they are not necessarily the calorie cutting kind. You are building muscle which increases you basal metabolic rate. It is the building of muscle that actually burns the calories. However it will take years of exercise to actually help you lose weight, this kind of reporting makes people think that overnight if they work hard enough they&#39;ll just start shedding pounds. Then these people get discouraged and quit right out of the gate. The message should be that this will be hard and it will take a long time but you will get there. If you fail it doesn&#39;t matter just try to have more good days than bad days. <br><br>Now where exercise does immediately start to help is improving cognitive function and mood. The diets should actually help as well, as long as you aren&#39;t trying to calorie restrict on top of them. Try and get plenty of sleep and do lots of things that make you happy like seeing family and friends more often, even if you have to carve that time from a very hectic schedule. Your mental health is one of the biggest assets you have when it comes to trying to lose weight. Make sure when you go grocery shopping to only buy good food, don&#39;t buy the snacks or soft drinks and it will become so much easier to eat healthy, as that is all you have. Stop eating out and remember you&#39;re in it for the long haul. Start your new diet by just cutting out the processed crap, then see if there are any diets that strike your fancy after extensive research. <br><br>I get worked up about this because diet and exercise are literally the medicine to cure most of the diseases that kill the modern world, and videos like this CANNOT cover the nuance in just ~10 minutes. If you want in-depth discussions start looking up science based research. Read Dr. Valter Longo&#39;s book The Longevity Diet (or watch here: <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d6PyyatqJSE)\">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d6PyyatqJSE)</a>, Dr. Jason Fung&#39;s The Diabetes code (or watch: <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jXXGxoNFag4)\">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jXXGxoNFag4)</a>, or Dr. Rhonda Patrick&#39;s entire youtube channel (<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/user/FoundMyFitness)\">https://www.youtube.com/user/FoundMyFitness)</a>. Or just follow this advice from Prof. Michael Pollan, &quot; Eat food. Not too much. Mostly plants.&quot; <br><br>The words everything in moderation do NOT always apply (ie Smoking, Drinking, Driving through stop lights, sky diving without a parachute). They are words to slap over something you do not want to think about. Either do the research or say you don&#39;t know. I&#39;ve researched this for a long time and I am still pretty comfortable saying I do not know what diet will be best for you. But I do know that it will involve absolutely zero donuts, pastries, or confections of any kind. That&#39;s not to say you can&#39;t eat them, but treat it like a cigarette and make sure you enjoy the hell out of it when you eat it. Treat it like a treat, not food.
