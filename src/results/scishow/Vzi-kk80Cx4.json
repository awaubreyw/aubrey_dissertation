These grow from seed easily . I have to remove volunteers often . The flowers are beautiful  and a bee plant , the tree is also very very thorny and at times drops all its leaves . Than you can use the leaves (desert hay) for mulch or compost . It is in the legume family and is nitrogen fixing There is a selected  Palo Verde from nurseries called  Desert Museum it does not seed or have thorns . How ever then there is nothing for you or the wild life as the seeds are edible . You can cook the fresh green seed pods for 5 min in boiling then eat . Also my trees are growing with out added water - than you don&#39;t have to prune much .", "comment_date": "2022-08-01T19:52:11Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Jordan Blackerby", "comment_text": "I saw many of these scattered throughout Las Vegas.
