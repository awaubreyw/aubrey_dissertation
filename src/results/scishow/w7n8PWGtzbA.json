I soon obtained a regular slinky and experimented with what little I had to work with to amplify the sound by hanging the one end of the slinky from a handheld microphone the other end rested about 5 rings of the slinky on the floor. Tapping with a pencil produced some great sounds and even better when recorded and slowed down. Also found you can hear the slinky well by just sliding it onto an empty shoebox. Not sure if it fits the discussion of this video but it did remind me of the past.
