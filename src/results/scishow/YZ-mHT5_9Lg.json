Or had it already been made a decade ago and we just never had a problem? Then why was everyone freaking out about it so heavily if there were already vaccinations? It really wasn&#39;t that bad in the area I lived in in fact a lot of people start their eyes and that the vaccination started causing it because we didn&#39;t have major outbreaks in the areas where I lived until after people started getting vaccinated granted they had a smaller reaction to the flu than that what they would have had if they hadn&#39;t had the vaccination I believe but when you have a lot of people who just received a vaccination getting sick ... It makes me worry about any rushed vaccine no matter how needed are desperately may need it.

Moderna skipped that process and went straight into a Phase 1 trial. As a result, they started their clinical trial first, about 3 weeks before Inovio.  The other interesting thing, as you pointed out, is that Inovio had already started on a MERS vaccine, before they ever started on the covid-19 vaccine which should be a big advantage in choosing an effective construct against the virus.
