Injuries and <br>deaths are so uncommon that there isn\u2019t much written about them in the <br>medical literature. <br><br>A 2009 report in Occupational Health and Safety notes that people who <br>install and maintain elevators may become injured in a variety of ways, <br>including, \u201cfalls, electrical shocks, muscle strains and other injuries related to <br>lockout/tagout, confined spaces, scaffolds, cranes, rigging, hoisting <br>and heavy equipment.\u201d The safety profile for passengers is much <br>better. \u201cBecause of the intricate, redundant and regulated safety <br>features built in to every elevator, catastrophes are rare outside of <br>movies and TV,\u201d according to the report. So-called rope elevators <br>require only one woven steel cable, but they usually have four to eight <br>cables just in case.
