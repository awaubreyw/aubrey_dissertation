A thought is are dreams are so complex but so is a roku, playstaion, an internet tower, cell phones or even our own brain. What if the subconscious is connected with not just the conscious world we live in but also a part like a signal to something when we&#39;re asleep. We can talk to eachother threw the air using invisable signals. As the universe expands as it is, whats to say in the center where it came from, the closest intelligent beeings have been around far longer than us. You drop a rock in a placid lake most of the wave will come from the edge of where the rock hit. What if we have signals triggering out subconscious. Allot of subconscious has feeling in it.
