I realize half a century ago most reasons why scientist were bugged about evolution and still will do for a pretty good time.  My understanding at the time keeps going because those scientists didn&#39;t figure it out yet.<br>First, we give to the word &#39;evolution&#39; much more meaning than what is due.<br>Second, most changes in the genetic code of any species is already known and, igf taken one by one, we must realize each of them is the result of a probability about one kind of modification.  So, saying at first sight that a mutation result in the lost of a character has many shortcomings.  A mutation change the whole code through only a small part of it.  So, that small part can be undone by the same order of probability.  At the human scale, it is most likely rare or not happening.  Since there so many parameters to take into account, a mutation can be anywhere and probably not the inverse of the first one.<br>I did compare as a young biology student the genetic code to a computer program (at the time I knew only Fortran+, pretty old for most living human today) with its linear code, but with subroutines more or less complex and applicable at many different places alongside that linear code.  That is very close to the functioning genetic code.  Practice coding or dig into Microsoft / Windows difficulties over their 25 first years and you will have much more insights about evolution, atavisms, mutations...<br>I didn&#39;t say the tenth of what I understood at that time and most genetic discoveries since then are unveilling my thoughts at the time.
