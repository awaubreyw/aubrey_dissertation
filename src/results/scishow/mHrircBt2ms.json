Incandescent light bulbs work by heating up the filament to a temperature where it emits light. When the light is dimmed, it is switched on and off, but this happens so quickly that it doesn&#39;t cool off, it just has a lower temperature, and therefore lower brightness, because the power being delivered to it is lower. LED lights dim by intelligent circuitry that limits their current. They do switch on and off rapidly, but this is smoothed out by capacitors and inductors, so there is no actual strobing.  Furthermore, if our lights were strobing at 120Hz, we would definitely noticed it. Some low quality LED bulbs lack a smoothing capacitor, and as a result they flicker at 120Hz (not 60Hz because it is full wave rectified). This is visible and very annoying. They also only talked about leading edge phase angle control dimmers, while many newer designs are trailing edge. SciShow, I usually love your content but this video is full of mistakes and misleading. It is poor quality, and I urge you to pull it immediately and issue a correction.
