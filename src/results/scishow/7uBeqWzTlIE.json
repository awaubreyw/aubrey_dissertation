Upon receiving the pigeons, he waited until evening and attached small containers with live coals to each one, and released them. The pigeons, of course, all flew home to their cotes, many of which then caught fire, and the city burned. We still have a proverb that the pigeons have come home to roost.

Maybe because it hits a little too close to home, there&#39;s no worse condemnation for me than calling something I accept irrational and not based on empirical evidence or logic. When I was a kid I wanted to be a biologist, and now I&#39;m going to university I am studying mathematics because I just can&#39;t accept things that are inelegant or have questionable validity. I also used to be a person who thought like those people in the comments, and I lost a friend because of it. It wasn&#39;t even ideas that made me so insensitive, it was words. I hadn&#39;t really been taught the gender and biological sex were different things, and for a very brief time after I was I wasn&#39;t convinced English didn&#39;t need redundancies in its words for biological sex. People aren&#39;t denying the existence of sexual dimorphism (forgetting for a time rarer occurrences that lead to intersex peoples who shouldn&#39;t really be forgotten), what they are saying is that small hormonal differences and the production of one kind of genitals or another is not necessary <b>or</b> sufficient to act in a permutation one of two almost entirely socially and historically defined roles (or for that matter to be committed to and defined by those genitals). The entire notion that having more complex ways to describe things is less scientific is alien to me, especially in the softer &quot;stamp collecting&quot; fields. Yes, making models is great, but biology is too messy to even make biological sex binary, it&#39;s crazy to think you can have a completely accurate nontrivial binary classifier for something as complex in its structure as a brain.  Yes, the brain is lacking in a lot of ways I want my primary computer to be, it falls into local maxima or minima for games where there is an ideal solution, and it can be clouded by emotions evolutionarily designed for primitive circumstances, but it&#39;s still a network with around 86 billion nodes and it&#39;s the biggest computational black box problem...ever. It seems like you&#39;re losing information if you decide there are only two types of this abstract structure, wrong if you&#39;re basing it on another loosely correlated factor outside the structure, and losing the battle if you assign a bunch of cultural and historical baggage to people who don&#39;t want it.", "comment_date": "2018-09-13T00:13:34Z", "likes_count": 29}, {"comment_by": "DrSharkBoy", "comment_text": "<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7uBeqWzTlIE&amp;t=13m17s\">13:17</a><br><br><b>Megolovania intensifies</b>", "comment_date": "2018-09-12T23:51:40Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "qsdfcvgyjmkl", "comment_text": "What the heck?!
