It is my two decades experience of the hellish pain of pneumonia and inflammation . There are thousands of species of living things on earth, covid 19 is only fatal for humans, why? most of the animals never face inflammation severely like humans. why? Some patients have been facing long covid and some of them still didn&#39;t get rid of it completely. Why? A human body takes 15 days to get immunity against any virus but  many covid patients didn&#39;t get immunity against it even after one  and a half year later too. Why? The other thing, covid 19 is fatal only for 1 or less than  one percent of the infected people, while 99 percent get survived with it and if the patients who are severely affected get ventilator and other facilities on time then the mortality rate would be less than that, so the main thing that has been killing the people it is not the virus directly, it is the severe inflammation. Who he survived this severe inflammation doesn&#39;t need to be afraid of any sort of covid 19 or it&#39;s variants. See the description box of the given video, it  answers,  all these questions..dear friends I was a very severe patient of pneumonia and inflammation and it&#39;s been three years and I won&#39;t face neither pneumonia nor inflammation now. but I follow my diet plan very very strictly..I want to ask the doctors, why don&#39;t I face pneumonia now, is the pneumonia virus  no more exist in the atmosphere? If not then why? I tell you the reason because now my body doesn&#39;t act overwhelmingly on pneumonia virus thus if the patient&#39;s body doesn&#39;t act overwhelmingly on covid 19 virus he never faces inflammation overwhelmingly and he is safe.\u00a9\u00a9\u00a2\u00a2\u00a5]] [\u20ac\u00a5\u00a2\u00ae\u2122&lt;&lt;} {] [\u20ac\u00a5\u00a9\u00ae\u2122", "comment_date": "2022-08-21T01:25:49Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "carter antwuan", "comment_text": "Today i am free from Herpes with the help of Dr harry herbs on YouTube who cure me from herpes virus with his Herbal medicine..", "comment_date": "2022-08-20T03:48:25Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Safe&Effective!", "comment_text": "Folks, do yourself a favor and compare the symptoms of mm radiation exposure symptoms alongside the widely reported &quot;long covid&quot; symptoms, and you will find that they mirror each other.", "comment_date": "2022-08-18T20:24:38Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "stevedon79", "comment_text": "Polio:  Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome is one of 1291 adverse effects reported by Pfizer as  court ordered disclosure in the vax.

Later I read that it controls mast cells and I read about mast cell activation syndrome; I kind of a bit self diagnosed myself as I do experience a lot of similar symptoms though with autoimmune stuff you just never know k guess. <br> I got mild but on a heavy side of mild covid in May last year: as in I was not hospitalized but I was dead sick for 3 weeks with crazy cough and complete fatigue that I slept 22/24 hours and barely could walk without being exhausted.

I\u2019ve been taking ketotifen every day beside I week of active covid sickness: I could not receive the pills in time and then when I had to walk one day I had a horrible \u201cattack\u201d (as I call it, basically incident when I have a sudden onslaught of symptoms that stops me from what I\u2019m doing and makes me cease activity for several hours), as in walking caused severe itchiness all over that got so strong it\u2019s painful, some blood pressure change, brain fog and cognitive-psychological reaction - normal for such cases for me, as soon as I stop and lay down it normally starts easing. I needed to walk 500 meters really bad, had no choice, I had to stop every 10 steps. To think about it - it was the strongest \u201cattack\u201d I\u2019ve ever had.

When I was a teenager, I had a particularly nasty ear infection that caused my entire body to shut down. I had to go on multiple rounds of antibiotics and fell into a dark depression because I was basically just passing out during the middle of the day from exhaustion. Somehow despite my physical symptoms, I was told it was somehow all in my head and that I should just magically get over it. Fast forward to adulthood and college nearly killed me. I barely graduated, and when I started working I could only work a part time job and still wound up passing out dead tired after only a 4 hour shift, needing the entire rest of the day to recover. It wasn\u2019t like I didn\u2019t have ambitions and hobbies, but I never had any time to complete any projects I wanted to do because working took 100% of my energy. Little did I know that this wasn\u2019t normal and that other people had an abundance of energy I could only dream of. I wasn\u2019t lazy! My body simply wasn\u2019t keeping up with what my mind wanted to do! I luckily had a colleague who had been experiencing similar symptoms and that\u2019s where I first heard of Chronic Fatigue Syndrome. I unfortunately think it\u2019s possible I got a very early case of Covid (before testing was even available) which only made my fatigue, brain fog and forgetting words even worse than they already were, and I officially caught Covid in January 2022. I\u2019m thankful that long covid has finally shined a light on Chronic Fatigue Syndrome, but I\u2019m also super sad that people who were suffering with these symptoms were basically being gaslight and told it was all in their head, until people who never had to experience this debilitating condition experienced it for the first time ever post Covid.

Since the beginning I noted that long-haul variance coinides with the variance of different ways Sugar damages you, and kind of follows a &quot;path of least resistance.&quot; I am uneducated, but I know damned well they are connected.<br><br>Societal Whole Health Capability (SWHC), which the government disrupted for 2 straight years, is the level of capability we have across society to take care of our individual Health needs, from Psychological Health to Physiological Health to Microbiome Health and back. All of the different healths rely on Financial Health, which was ripped apart country-wide by lockdowns.\r<br>\r<br>Financial Health not only dictates what you can buy for food, but also Psychological, Emotional, and Social Health outcomes. No job or money? No spouse, starving children, extra stress, etc. etc. etc. \r<br>\r<br>Diet dictates your Microbiome, and the Microbiome also influences Diet. The Microbiome also influences Psychological, Emotional, Physiological, and Immunological Health. In, turn, these areas of Health influence Social and Financial Health as well as Habits and Lifestyle. Your Habits and Lifestyle affect your Microbiome.\r<br>\r<br>Psychological Health influences whether or not you can attain and hold employment or Social status. It dictates your Habits and Diet, and in turn the Microbiome. Psychological Health affects Emotional Health as well.\r<br>\r<br>Social Health--any Social activity (especially one with human contact) breeds Oxytocin, which boosts Immune Function. Isolation as a countermeasure was a huge mistake. Your Social Health affects all the other areas of Health as well. \r<br>\r<br>I could keep going, but I am pretty sure that picture is laid out: all sectors of Health influence each other and perpetuate whatever cycle one is in. The most important part is that all of these areas of Health influence your Immune Function. That makes the lockdowns and mandates and fearmongering (abuse of fight-or-flight system kills Immune Function) surrounding the two <b>counter-productive</b> in almost every way imaginable. \r<br>\r<br>Now I will skip to number 11 of SWHC: Early Treatment/Outpatient Measures. Instead of relying on three one-dimensional measures, we could have been addressing all of the above while using off-label medications to stop Inflammation--the REAL killer; not COVID-19. Not one had to die, but our lovely governments chose &quot;Isolation, Vaccination, Mask the Nation&quot; (IVMN, ironically) as their strategy... \r<br>\r<br>A list of the off-label medications that would have worked for COVID-19 treatment includes but is not limited to: <b>Zinc, Vitamin C, Vitamin D, Ivermectin, Chloroquine, Hydroxychloroquine, Monoclonal Antibodies, Steroids, Molnupiravir, Antiandrogen Therapy, Spironolactone, Fluvoxamine, Nitazoxanide, Melatonin</b> and more. NOT ONE HAD TO DIE. Remdesivir, however, actually INCREASES likelihood of death, yet that was approved for use for COVID-19 inflammation over the rest of these.

I had it for 10 months after first wave infection in 2020. The virus goes away after 1-1/2 weeks, but the antibodies remains for months.<br><br>What I recommend for people who are experiencing long-covid symptoms are the following:<br><br>1. Don&#39;t despair. Never despair. The reactions of the strong symptoms can affect the psychotic part of the brain as one begins to experience hopelessness. You don&#39;t want your mind to be affected in a way that could cycle anxiety at the present time or in the future. So, stay positive and don&#39;t think that your going to die no matter how you feel. Stay focused at all times on the positive side cause the symptoms are just symptoms.<br><br>2. Do not stress the muscles by doing strong exercises because the muscle are at a state of compromise which is why fatigue, anxiety, tremors, panic attacks, etc are being experienced. Do light exercises, like short walks or light stretches and keep active so the muscles do not fall into atrophy that would worsen your\u00a0symptoms. Breathing exersises are excellent but be careful with overstretching because the tearing of muscle may produce acute, terrible pain. Rest when your body &quot;tells&quot; you it needs it but keep it active when it can.<br><br>3. Vitamins. Vitamins are ONLY to sustain the body&#39;s health while going through the covid symptoms phase. It is not a cure of any symptoms. Some may make you feel good, MAYBE, but the goal is to sustain the body for as long as it takes to recuperate. You will be surprised at how much you could be deficient in vitamins. 50% of the world population are critically deficient in magnesium and even in Vitamin D3. Do not take multi vitamins. Some ingredients like selenium or folate may cause reactions. Keep them separate (b1, b2, d3, etc). Remember that your muscles are somehow compromised into a weakened state so a multi vitamin may cause a reaction. It&#39;s important to remain healthy so if you are not eating healthy use supplements but of low dose. For example, B12 must be no more than 2.4mcg. Besides D3 and C, Magnesium is very important because it helps the muscles to relax and is healthy for the brain. Do the research on it, I am not lying. 200mg is ok every other day until your body gets over the diarrhea. I took magnesium oxide but you should research before taking other type. Protein powder is good to give the muscles essential amino acids. Pea protein powder is good because it is the least type that has caused allergic reactions. Again, do your research according to your body.<br><br>4. Doctors are telling you that it&#39;s &quot;all in your head&quot;? OK, then there&#39;s nothing wrong going to a psychiatrist so that you can be prescribed Valium to alleviate anxieties , tremors, insomnia, rapid heart beats, etc. This is if you truly need it. It should be only a last resort option because some medications can help to alleviate terrible symptoms on a temporary basis. I took Valium and it did give relief. Other option may be available based on your own body&#39;s specific reaction. In 2020 I didn&#39;t have anything else that I could have explored but now they are saying over the counter Histamine products or steroids can be useful as some relief. Mount Sinia hospital in NY is now actively running a long-covid health service. Maybe in your area the same is being done? Be active in your research and be ahead of the latest reports from doctors that may be able to provide help in the future.<br><br>5. DO NOT DESPAIR. This is repeated because it is impossible for me to over-emphasize how critically important it is to maintain a healthy focused mindset DURING THIS TIME. Pray, meditate, do yoga, see comedy, ask someone to tickle you ... DO WHATEVER IT TAKES to keep positive because the reality is that you can get over this. Just be patient. In fact, this is the PERFECT time to acquire patience, which is a virtue. When one gets into an accident it takes the body a while to recuperate. Yes, that&#39;s how it will happen to you.<br><br>6. Stay close to loved ones and those who can support you. If you are alone then stay in contact with others who may be experiencing the same. Support groups are so important. I had one and it was God and my mom.<br><br>May God bless everyone during this time.", "comment_date": "2022-05-06T02:10:26Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Ellen Hulslander", "comment_text": "You lost me at &quot;people assigned female at birth&quot;.<br>I don&#39;t trust ANY so called doctor that abandons biology in favor of fantasy.", "comment_date": "2022-05-05T20:07:17Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Ann-Marie Folwell", "comment_text": "I developed peripheral nerve damage after Covid.", "comment_date": "2022-05-05T18:52:33Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Crystal Green", "comment_text": "Two weeks after my husband\u2019s second COVID shot he had a stroke.

When I recently learned that many COVID &quot;long haulers&quot; had symptoms of dysautonomic conditions (such as MCAS, FM, POTS) I suddenly realized that the world was about to change in so many ways because this illness now created a significant amount of people with significant disabling health issues that have gone ignored by much of society throughout human history. I grew up with my disability but it didn&#39;t become severe until I became less active in college. No amount of stairs or walking was enough activity with an autonomic condition. I had been managing the condition until this point in my life by simply attending gym classes despite the chest pain and shortness of breath. <br>My circulation and blood pressure were weak but none of the doctors could figure out what was happening, until 2019 when one young ER doctor who had been somewhat familiar with dysautonomia had referred me to my first neurologist which is when the diagnosis and physical therapy began (the doctor&#39;s age matters because younger doctors appear to be more familiar with recent research). <br><br>I cannot express how frustrating it can be to live with these symptoms without answers. I felt like it would eventually kill me and nobody could save me. It was horrible knowing most of my life that something was wrong with my heart, lungs, and sweat glands but I never considered that they would be neurological. Not just neurological, but that the part of the nervous system controlling every involuntary action in my body would be the source of the malfunction. Countless doctors couldn&#39;t figure it out because the symptoms were so subtle on the surface and the tests they performed came back normally because the organs are fine. It&#39;s the nerves controlling the organs and veins that are malfunctioning, hence, the dysautonomia (autonomic nervous system dysfunction). <br><br>Knowing now that so many scientists have been diligently studying these autonomic conditions as a result of the lingering &quot;long COVID&quot; symptoms gives me so much hope because it seems like people experiencing dysautonomic conditions won&#39;t spend a lifetime without answers. It makes me think about all of the people who&#39;ve lived with this their entire lives and died without answers. How many people were disregarded as being dramatic or attention-seeking just because they experienced debilitating symptoms and suffered every time they stood up. I was told incessantly that this was &quot;all in my head&quot; because the research had been so new that most of the doctors I was seeing were simple unaware of autonomic conditions, let along that my issue is neurological. So COVID shone a very bright light on this new research about dysautonomia and people can finally add this to the conditions that humanity is much more aware of, which means that less people will suffer in silence without the answers and treatment that they need. It makes us much stronger as a species to understand what ailments we are facing, and Im EXTREMELY thankful that I was able to get my answers at a young age, albeit twenty years after my first experience with an autonomic dysfunction episode. I have been very fortunate to be born during an era that would eventually understand invisible illnesses, regardless of how long I&#39;d lived in the shadows.

There should have been an automatic assumption that this disease would cause long term health damage in many people. Why would it not? It literally attacks every organ in your body AND causes blood clots.  It&#39;s the perfect storm for long term health effects. The young and the fit will mostly fully recover because of the bodies natural resilience, but many people are going to face a long recovery period. Some people will be left with albeit mild, but permanent damage to their lungs and other organs. <br>Personally I think this is the motivation behind Chinas &quot;zero covid policy&quot;. Given there is now a well documented paper trail leading all the way from the NIH to The Wuhan Institute, I think its fairly uncontroversial to say that this virus originated from a Chinese lab. The Chinese should by rights know more about the virus than anyone, since they know its origins, and the nature of the gene splicing involved in its creation. Well they seem fairly hell bent on NOT letting it run rampant through the population, and have committed to a disruptive and expensive strategy of trying to minimise their populations exposure to the disease.

The covid vaccine does not mach the pre pandemic definition of vaccine, for while the prpa (pre pandemic) version was a small dose of the virus or dead viruses so that your body recognises it and fights it better, the new covid vaccine acctually replaces your rna, this has been stated in the moderna website. The problem with this is that this is a horribly unsuccesful treatment, if you look at modernas test results, (also on their own website) for their older rna treatment they all failed horribly! All the teat rats dies from blood clots, cardiac arrests, neurological symptoms, and much more. In fact if you look at the website it sais that the vaccine is still in its testing phase, this means that they have not even finished testing it.... most vaccines are tested for years bofore use, but this one was used without regard of this fact because everyone was in a panic, and when people are in a panic you can get them to do dumb stuff without thinking. Now a few months ago there was a russian doctor who released a video talking about how the vaccine was not safe, a few days later he was arrested and was later let go with the command not to talk about this again, he later made another video altink about every in and out that he claim to know about the vaccine, and how it used small fragments of a kind of carbon, these fragments were shaped in a way so that it would only get into the bloodstream if they went past the muscles, becuase of the shape there was a very large chance that it would get trapped in them, but the ones that didn`t went straight into the bloodstream where it would cause a lot of damage, around a week later the doctor died mysteriously, the video still floats around the internet today. I think ive said enough for now, hopefully anyone who reads this will gat a bit curious and do some digging, the only reason i put this out here was so that hopefully a few of you might spread the news, and if you do doubt me or these sources, then why don`t you doubt the media that you watch?

After I finished those though as soon as the steroid wore off I had extreme body fatigue and pain, I was unable to walk long distances and it hurt my muscles, my back, my joints, my hips, my calves, my ankles. To even bend to sit on the toilet was terrible. I felt like I was a geriatric patient which is ironic because I am a healthcare professional. I was in just awful pain. I went back and was prescribed tramadol and a steroid cluster pack, 6 one day, 5 the next, and so on. I finished the steroids but I had an intense reaction either to the combination of the steroid pack and covid or the steroid pack and tramadol combined. I had what I think is an allergic reaction as I started to have problems swallowing in the morning and throughout the day and shortness of breath. The problem with the shortness of breath is that I had similar issues from chronic bronchitis. The major worry for me when I decided to stop taking the tramadol was on top of the other issues I had an extreme breakout, on my chest, shoulders, and back. They were not at least to me they did not seem like normal pimples or even extreme pimples. Since the whole thing started I stopped and threw away the tramadol which before when I had been prescribed it I had had no issues so I wasn&#39;t worried about it they stopped. But the breakout persisted. I bought a body wash from Neutrogena for acne with salicyc acid and it helped clear some up but now I have strange big ones pop up with green puss heads almost like the only thing I can describe is like spider bites or MRSA. But I&#39;ve never had a spider bite or MRSA that I&#39;ve been diagnosed with. They are very very tender and painful. I&#39;ve had 3 now and they cause extreme pain.

Its just so odd for me to be feeling this now post covid.

Even now though the skin thing persists. And so does the fatigue and now depression.

I had lots of blood tests ordered by my pediatrician in the post-infection period, as my white blood cell count had dropped below normal levels.<br><br>On top of that, I suddenly became impossible to wake up in the mornings, and would continue to feel tired throughout the day. Sometimes I would feel completely fine walking around the mall, but then I would suddenly feel this wave of exhaustion wash over me, and I had to find someplace to sit down and take a break. I would feel a bit better after some rest, but those waves of exhaustion would hit at the strangest times.<br><br>I had also developed joint pain, insomnia, stomach issues, and brain fog. On top of this, I already had a preexisting history of POTS, stomach issues, and congenital hip dysplasia that was treated successfully, but needed PT a few times over the years. Luckily, my white blood count came back up, but my other blood tests came back mostly normal, and my pediatrician was stumped, so she referred me to the local rheumatology clinic, as well as the sleep medicine clinic.<br><br>At first, I got a preliminary diagnosis of juvenile fibromyalgia, but my rheumatologist didn&#39;t see kids much, so he referred me to the only pediatric rheumatology clinic in the state, at the University hospital. She saw me, realized I was hypermobile, and sent me off to genetics, who confirmed the rheumatologist&#39;s suspicions. I actually had a genetic disorder called Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, and many of my issues could be attributed to that. My fatigue was worse than most EDS patients, but it still seemed like the likely culprit at that point, especially after my first sleep study+MSLT comes back negative.<br><br>Years later, I&#39;m back at my old sleep center clinic. This time, I was seen by a neurologist who split his time between there and the neurology clinic nearby. Not much had changed, but I was even more tired, and had so much trouble with being exhausted in the mornings, yet struggling to fall asleep at night. Once I was asleep though, I would sleep for 10-14 hours if not woken up. Curiously, I had also started having visual hallucinations when I started to fall asleep. They were dream-like in every sense of the word, and that symptom made him suspect that something was up, along with one other nearly-forgotten fact from my medical history: these symptoms started shortly after my influenza infection. <br><br>He convinced my insurance company to pay for another sleep study, and... it came back negative. When I first heard the results over the phone, I was devastated. I almost skipped my next appointment with him, thinking it would be the same as my other negative test results. Despite my fears, I came in anyway, ready to be disappointed. Instead, he asked me &quot;hey, question, did I forget to tell you to stop taking your antidepressant before the sleep study?&quot;<br><br>I soon learned that both sleep studies were almost definitely false negatives due to the SSRIs and SNRIs I&#39;d been on for years, and I actually had narcolepsy type 1. Also known as narcolepsy w/ cataplexy, research has shown that narcolepsy T1 is likely an immune-mediated post-infection disorder that&#39;s often associated with influenza (especially H1N1) and strep throat. Many doctors suspect that it&#39;s an autoimmune disorder that results in the destruction of neurons in the brain that produce an important neurotransmitter called hypocretin/orexin. The functions of this neurotransmitter are not fully understood, but we do know that not having enough of it definitely causes narcolepsy T1. Without it, the brain has a much harder time maintaining the barrier between wakefulness and sleep, and REM sleep starts to intrude into everyday life, causing excessive daytime sleepiness, sleep-related hallucinations, disrupted nighttime sleep, and cataplexy: mild-severe muscle weakness that is typically triggered by certain emotions.<br><br>Unfortunately, there aren&#39;t a lot of treatments out there for it, and nothing will make most narcoleptics feel completely &quot;normal&quot; again yet, but there are some good (and expensive) options out there that can really help. I&#39;m still working on finding the right treatment for me, but unfortunately, we have learned that Adderall and Ritalin do not play well with my brain, and I&#39;ll be trying a very expensive, slightly dangerous medication called Xywav next. It definitely has some risks, as well as some weird side effects sometimes, but Xywav, and sodium oxybate in general, works really well at night to help people with narcolepsy, so it&#39;s definitely worth a shot for me.", "comment_date": "2022-03-30T01:27:43Z", "likes_count": 3}, {"comment_by": "V3ryan", "comment_text": "At the end of January I got sick with what could have been covid (I didn&#39;t get tested, but it was all the classic symptoms)<br><br>Regardless I isolated until I recovered, however, I did have mild aches and pains in various areas of my body that lasted months after.", "comment_date": "2022-03-30T01:19:21Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "minRef", "comment_text": "This overlooks the potential importance of tissue reservoirs.

Hierbei handelt es sich \u00fcbrigens nicht um \u201eeingebildete\u201c Schmerzen, sondern um einen real gegebenen Schmerz. Das Gehirn hat n\u00e4mlich einen falschen und kontraproduktiven Umgang mit Schmerzen gelernt.\r<br>- M\u00fcdigkeit und Ersch\u00f6pfung (Fatigue)\r<br>\r<br>Die Post-COVID-Fatigue stellt nicht nur k\u00f6rperlich, sondern auch psychisch eine schwere Belastung dar. Die betroffenen Menschen f\u00fchlen sich auch nach kleinen k\u00f6rperlichen Anstrengungen bereits sehr ersch\u00f6pft und \u00fcberfordert. Die M\u00fcdigkeit kann auch chronisch sein und das bisherige Leistungsniveau kann nicht mehr erreicht werden.\r<br>\r<br> In diesem Beitrag gehe ich vor allem auf die psychologische Behandlung von Long-COVID ein. Es versteht sich von selbst, dass Menschen immer nach dem biopsychosozialen Modell behandelt werden sollten. \r<br>Auf medizinier Ebene braucht es medikament\u00f6se, neurokognitive, logop\u00e4dische und pulmonale Reha-Therapien, vor allem aber auch viel Zeit und Geduld auf Seiten der Patient*innen. Auch Psychopharmaka, etwa Antidepressiva gegen Depressionen und \u00c4ngste, k\u00f6nnen hilfreich sein. \r<br>\r<br>Menschen, die unter Long-COVID leiden sollten sich k\u00f6rperlich und in der Arbeit nicht \u00fcberfordern, allerdings ist auch eine Schonhaltung, sozialer R\u00fcckzug, zu viel Vorsicht und Vermeidung von Aktivit\u00e4ten, die bisher dem Leben Sinn und Freude gaben, \u00e4u\u00dferst kontraproduktiv und kann Depressionen, \u00c4ngste und Schlafst\u00f6rungen verschlimmern.\r<br>\r<br>Folgende Verhaltensweisen k\u00f6nnen auch langfristig sch\u00e4dlich sein: \r<br>\r<br>- weniger arbeiten oder gar nicht mehr arbeiten gehen\r<br>\r<br>- weniger allt\u00e4gliche Arbeiten (Haushalt, einkaufen, etwas heben oder tragen)\r<br>\r<br>- weniger T\u00e4tigkeiten, die Freude machen, Spa\u00df bereiten, Sinn geben oder als wertvoll erlebt werden\r<br>\r<br>- weniger soziale Kontakte \r<br>\r<br>- weniger Freundschaften und Beziehungen pflegen\r<br>\r<br>- sozialer R\u00fcckzug\r<br>\r<br>- vermehrter Missbrauch von Drogen, Alkohol und Medikamenten\r<br>\r<br>- Vermeidung, etwas Neues im Leben auszuprobieren\r<br>\r<br>- zu viele Pausen, zu viel Schlaf, zu viel ruhen und hinlegen \r<br>\r<br>- mehr Medikamente einnehmen oder falsche Medikamente (etwa Benzodiazepine, welche schnell abh\u00e4ngig machen)\r<br>\r<br>- \u00f6fters oder zu h\u00e4ufig zu \u00c4rzt*innen zu gehen \r<br>\r<br>\r<br>Es kann aber auch falsch sein, den K\u00f6rper rein funktional zu betrachten und die k\u00f6rperlichen Beschwerden v\u00f6llig zu \u00fcbergehen. Ich zwinge dann meinen geschw\u00e4chten K\u00f6rper, genauso leistungsf\u00e4hig wie vor Long-COVID zu sein, als ob Long-COVID gar nicht gegeben w\u00e4re (Verleugnung). Auch eine \u00dcberaktivit\u00e4t kann sch\u00e4dlich sein.\r<br>\r<br>Sowohl ein \u00dcberma\u00df an Schon- und Vermeidungsverhalten, als auch \u00fcberm\u00e4\u00dfige Aktivit\u00e4ten k\u00f6nnen bei Long-COVID Frustration, Ersch\u00f6pfung, Depression, Ohnmacht und Hilflosigkeit verst\u00e4rken. \r<br>\r<br>Fragen sie sich daher, wenn sie unter den Folgen von Long-COVID leiden, welche ihrer Verhaltensweisen langfristig eher f\u00f6rderlich und welche eher hinderlich oder sogar selbstsch\u00e4digend sind. \r<br>\r<br>\r<br>Viktor Frankl, der Begr\u00fcnder der Logotherapie, hat sehr sch\u00f6n formuliert, dass wir den Bedingungen unserer Existenz (etwa K\u00f6rper und Psyche) nicht v\u00f6llig ausgeliefert sind, sondern uns als Menschen immer bewusst entscheiden k\u00f6nnen, wie wir damit umgehen. Leide ich etwa an den Folgen einer Erkrankung wie COVID-19, so kann ich lernen, mit diesen Folgen anders und besser (personal und authentischer) zu handeln.\r<br>Eine Krankheit wie Long-COVID stellt fast immer eine massive existentielle Ersch\u00fctterung im Leben eines Menschen dar. Depressionen, starke \u00c4ngste, Gef\u00fchle der Leere, innere Unruhe, Wut und Trauer k\u00f6nnen einander abwechseln.\r<br>Psychotherapie und psychologische Hilfe k\u00f6nnen Ihnen helfen, die Erkrankung in Ihr Leben zu integrieren und belastende Emotionen auszuhalten, anzunehmen und durch sie hindurchzugehen.\r<br>In dieser Ersch\u00fctterung des Lebens liegen auch personale und existentielle Spuren, einen neuen Blick auf das Leben und seine sinnstiftenden M\u00f6glichkeiten zu finden. Trotz belastender Emotionen kann im therapeutischen Prozess neuer Lebensmut gefunden werden und der/die Betroffene kann sich dem Leben neu zuwenden und in Beziehung zu ihm treten.\r<br>\r<br>Wichtig ist es auch, trotz und gerade wegen all Ihrer Beschwerden, dass Sie wieder den Blick auf Ihre eigenen Kraftquellen richten, um besser mit ihren Long-COVID-Beschwerden zurecht zu kommen. Viele Dinge k\u00f6nnen wir auch dann tun, wenn wir unter Beschwerden leiden.\r<br>\r<br>Folgende Fragen zur Selbsterfahrung k\u00f6nnen Ihnen hier hilfreich sein:\r<br>Gibt es eine innere St\u00e4rke oder einen inneren Halt, der/die Sie schon Ihr ganzes Leben lang begleitet?\r<br>\r<br>Welche Kraftquellen haben sie fr\u00fcher genutzt?\r<br>\r<br>Welche Kraftquellen haben Ihnen in der Vergangenheit in schwierigen Zeiten geholfen, etwa in Zeiten von Krankheiten, Lebenskrisen oder wenn Sie Schmerzen hatten?\r<br>\r<br>Welche dieser Kraftquellen nutzen Sie heute nicht mehr?\r<br>\r<br>Welche dieser Kraftquellen k\u00f6nnten Sie heute wieder nutzen?\r<br>\r<br>Wer k\u00f6nnte Ihnen dabei helfen und was brauchen Sie daf\u00fcr?\r<br>\r<br>Was ist heute Ihre wichtigste St\u00e4rke und Ressource?\r<br>\r<br>Welche St\u00e4rken/Ressourcen und Kraftquellen nutzen Sie bereits, um mit Ihren Beschwerden besser umzugehen oder sich davon abzulenken?\r<br>\r<br>Was k\u00f6nnten Sie trotz Ihrer Beschwerden heute noch genie\u00dfen?\r<br>\r<br>Was gibt Ihnen unabh\u00e4ngig von Ihren Beschwerden Kraft, Sinn und ist wertvoll in Ihrem Leben?", "comment_date": "2022-03-29T14:10:49Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Brian Ross", "comment_text": "I&#39;m sorry for the people affected by this and similar disabilities.

WHAT IF, while the proteins and enzymes programmed by the mRNA vaccine are good at immediately fighting off the virus, the proteins and enzymes are lingering around causing this long-term post-infection symptoms. I suspect that not letting the body develop the enzymes on its own is what is causing this. Only the true stats will be able to tell.

So much the better if the suffering patient is female since the medical profession even has the term &quot;hysteria&quot;, the root of which is hyster, meaning womb!<br><br>Giardia, a digestive system pathogen, was mentioned toward the end of this video. Another possible root of long term sequelae to some infections, including SARS-CoV-2, might be damage to the gut. This has been suggested also in Long COVID. In my geographical area, 2017, 18 &amp; 19 especially, we had outbreaks of &quot;unknown&quot;, &quot;really tough&quot; viruses -- according to our doctors -- that started out as mild upper respiratory but which savaged the intestines within 48 hours. These monsters had many signs and symptoms similar to COVID but, apparently, without the noticeable mortality. Some people never fully recovered and Fibromyalgia, CFS/ME developed in some. <br><br>Had doctors and researchers LISTENED TO THEIR SUFFERING PATIENTS decades before now, we may have had answers when SARS-CoV-2 occurred. It is time to boot the psychology profession in the arse and actually find answers to devastating illnesses!", "comment_date": "2022-03-27T17:19:33Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "49spfein.9999", "comment_text": "I will continue to promote cannabis over pharmaceutical gangsters playing with experimental drugs at YOUR expense", "comment_date": "2022-03-27T17:02:18Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Anna Lisette", "comment_text": "This isn&#39;t exactly anything new!

When I researched lupus, MS, fibro, and the feeling dehydrated/stiff muscle one, I was thinking that MS, fibro, long covid and Epstein Barr were all post illness or post infection/trauma reactions.  I did not know about the cfs/me thing.  I just read, alot.  I&#39;ve caught covid four times.  It was second covid that blew up my brain and made life way too interesting.  I can think now, but old injuries or traumas affect me much more than they used to.  I used to be hyper and a space cadet, but could &quot;act&quot; normal-ish at work.  Now I act more like my kids, ADHD-Autistic. I used to be able to push my body beyond it&#39;s limits for months at a time, now I feel like a delicate older lady.  { 1st covid was before Mardi Gras of 2020, 2nd was Thanksgiving week 2020, 3rd was July 2021, 4th was ?Dec 2021.}  I know that parasitic infections could lead to diseases that look like your body attacks itself, but would like to know more about how trauma, illnesses, and cognitive changes are related. I have a theory that illness makes depression worse and that healthy foods vitamins, nutrients, fiber, and the small things that help bodily processes should be used to help treat psychological disorders;  because the brain and body signal each other. I don&#39;t believe that some things are &quot;just in your head&quot;, or that other things are just &quot;in your gut&quot;.  People are amazingly beautiful complex creatures that have minds, will, spirit, bones, muscles, nerves, hormones, neurons, chemicals, and environments. I think that psychology tried to label and identify (place in a box) too many different syndromes or symptoms that may have comorbid or even different starting points.  [cue ball reaction, genetic components, after viral inflammation, loss of hormones, hyperthyroid, etc.]  I never tested positive, but my son did.  My doctor said I have antibodies.  I was vaccinated as soon as the vaccines were available in a large (drive thru)  area close to my home.  I got the booster when I was still feeling ill.  It seems like first covid made my seasonal colds and sinus infections extreme.  I lived off of cold medicines, {antihistamines?} and an antacid medicine that was supposed to help against covid for a year or two, (IBS) but I kept getting sick any way.  This year, I haven&#39;t gotten covid. I just have old injuries and muscle spasms, cramps, pain.  I did have a migraine.  I never had severe covid, it just felt like it.  I never had trouble breathing, just everything else. Every time I catch covid, it is a little less intense, but instead of a week long, it gets longer.  It would be so nice if doctors, nurses, and biologists could see as much research as you do, but our medical people are overwhelmed.  My family has a collagen disorder that one of my moms nurses didn&#39;t know anything about.  I keep explaining it. I used to be able to go to sleep at 2 am and wake up for 8.  During second covid I developed insomnia that lasted all night or a night and a day, often. Now, I have depression and anxiety medicine that helps me relax a little and lay down.  If I have to get up early, I have to take a melatonin, and a muscle relaxer as well.  I had tremors in 2010, they are worse now. I was always a sensitive person, but I can&#39;t be tough anymore, I have to be careful. I will share this video twice.

I guess it&#39;s just as well most of them don&#39;t know the inconvenience of juvenile rheumatoid arthritis or long covid!<br><br>My trust in the kindness of strangers has eroded a great deal over the past two years, between all the people demanding the right to be contagious, when they know Covid can kill or infect anyone with a longterm debilitating illness, and even attacking or shaming those of us daring to take precautions, both for ourselves and others, making us feel embarrassed to do so at best, threatened at worst. Nor is callousness restricted only to those misled by misinformation into believing COVID&#39;s effects are overblown or masking is useless. Lately, there&#39;s been a growing chorus of health officials, newscasters, government leaders, and even the head of the CDC saying the &quot;good news&quot; is that the &quot;only&quot; vaccinated people dying from covid now are those with existing health conditions, so let&#39;s just lift all restrictions and get back to normal! <br><br>I know she meant to say the good news was that the vaccine prevented <b>able-bodied</b> people from hospitalization or dying even if you had a breakthrough infection, so get it if you haven&#39;t. But what she actually said, dismissing the deaths of those with preexisting conditions, has been echoed openly or less openly by various people in authority (like TFG) since the early days of the pandemic: <b>Oh, well, they&#39;re &quot;unwell,&quot; so they&#39;ll die soon anyway. Grandma is happy to die for the economy. It&#39;s just poor people. It&#39;s just Them.</b><br><br><br>Think how many more people with preexisting conditions there are now than when the pandemic started. Yes, people with long covid have antibodies against COVID-19, but as new strains develop and antibody counts drop off, will that boost counteract the impact of longterm fatigue, aggravated MAST cells, scarring in lungs and/or other organs? What about everyone who gained weight or got out of shape staying home in 2020? How have stress, depression, job loss, impacted the public? How many millions of people avoided routine medical checkups or non-emergency medical procedures out of fear of catching covid, or because of an overworked health system? And how have each of those factors aggravated preexisting health conditions? <br><br>Luckily, a lot of researchers and scientists still care about the vulnerable, even if it sounds like most government officials, business leaders, the general population, and even some tactless health officials in high places want to wash their hands of the vulnerable in order to Return to Normal (tm). <br><br>Pardon the spleen ventage. I don&#39;t want to be too negative partly for Hanks sake, when he&#39;s being positive and pushing through some challenges himself! At any rate good luck to everyone fighting covid, long or short, and don&#39;t beat yourselves up about it... an epidemic is always contagious as its weakest link, which almost certainly wasn&#39;t you!", "comment_date": "2022-03-18T00:17:49Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "SJ", "comment_text": "Funny how only the vaxxed have long covid...  hmmm", "comment_date": "2022-03-17T23:56:03Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Georgi Purvanov", "comment_text": "I&#39;ve had long haul covid since way back in 2016-2017 when countries started buying pcr tests.

Everyone else recovered but a month after, my son got all the severe symptoms again, then 4 weeks later the vomiting and diarrhea were back again. This continued over a year or two until it was 6 days out of 7. He slept on the toilet for a full year and then on the floor of the bathroom for a further year. During the day he was pressured to go to school and it was hard for teachers to understand why he couldn&#39;t. He was exhausted and in pain. All regular causes were ruled out. I did research and found a disease called Eosinophilic GI Disease that fit many of his GI symptoms including choking on food and sure enough he was diagnosed with that. Meanwhile after several years of malnutrition from the constant vomiting and diarrhea he had stopped growing and a bone age scan revealed he was 2 years behind his birth age (after a new medication at age 16 he suddenly went from 5&#39;4&quot; to 6&#39;1&quot; in 18 months). <br>But back to his tween years, again after research I had read about MCAS causing more nocturnal symptoms so did a trial of H1 and H2 antihistamines which was successful so he was prescribed Ketotifen, a mast call stabilizer which stopped the vomiting almost overnight. <br><br>He&#39;s now 18, diagnosed with Eosinophilic Esophagitis, MCAS, POTS, IBS (C&amp;D), migraines and many more.

At 18 he has only completed 4 courses so it&#39;s going to be a long time. As if the exhaustion of the diseases and post infection syndrome wasn&#39;t bad enough he also has exhaustion and brain fog from all the meds he needs to keep him functioning (he is on over $40,000 worth of medications every year). He is currently undergoing a cardiac rehab program to try to get his fitness and tachycardia to be in a better place but it&#39;s proving exhausting too. <br>There has been so little hope or interest in his case, especially from the school and medical systems (some doctors would drop him because he couldn&#39;t attend appointments in person while have a severe stomach bug like symptoms). <br>I can only hope that the awful occurrence of Long Covid will also draw attention to cases like my son and help ensure that other kids and adults don&#39;t have to go through what he has. <br>He Doesnt Forget To Be Awesome though and recently won a community volunteer award in our city!", "comment_date": "2022-03-17T00:37:31Z", "likes_count": 354}, {"comment_by": "Jason W", "comment_text": "Ok so I&#39;ve had long covid for pretty much my whole life then", "comment_date": "2022-03-17T00:35:17Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Stanley Denning", "comment_text": "I just want a cure for old age.
