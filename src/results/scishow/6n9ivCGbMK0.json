But the same thing happened  to the pray - it had to be fast to escape the cheetahs so only the fastest gazelles and antilopes survived to pass their genes. If the parents are the fastest, than the offsprings will be faster on average than previous generations. But if the pray is faster, the predator needs to be faster if it is to survive, so again the fastest chettah survived to make even faster offsprings. It&#39;s a vicious circle that forced both the cheetah and its pray to become the fastest land animals. Stupid competition, they&#39;re in the same spot they would have been had they run slower, but now they waste more energy.
