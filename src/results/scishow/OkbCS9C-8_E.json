And can&#39;t parasites be ingested many ways unknowingly and  stay inside us causing covid style diarrhea and travel through out body causing immune systems to react and shut down parts of the body also leaving lasting long term effects like a brain fog. Why is no one talking about the long term effect of hair loss apparently people are struggling with??  Or the aggressive nature I&#39;ve definitely noticed after people seemed to have followed government mandate rule.?? Is it just me or is that a common side effect??<br>Can&#39;t get 1 straight answer about any of it not 1 agreed fact since day 1. <br>Seems like something to ponder and be aware of, there are clearly those benefiting and those who are sold on idea they could benefit by listening to one with more to gain... Many <br>Mushrooms could solve all our issues why aren&#39;t they funding that science and research??  Where&#39;s the urgency to Save Earth naturally and perhaps save humanity... But look in the mirror and then look around you and then think how you feel about most situations or people you encounter lately or last 10years. Should humanity be saved do we deserve it, would it change anything<br> History just repeats because we never change and so smart we ended up destroying our own species, all the other species and all plants and water supplies that are essential to our survival. That&#39;s not survival of fittest, smartest or a worthy species.<br>Enjoy the small moments be grateful for what&#39;s left of Earth&#39;s wonderous beauy and intriguing mysteries that we are part of..<br><br>Earth&#39;s Natural wonders proof we&#39;re not alone almost everything on Earth is alive and so far if you can imagine it, it&#39;s here and many more living things you didn&#39;t imagine because you forgot how to see nature with your imaginations. <br>You never feel alone because the trees and mushrooms and plants are all fully aware of your presence but you&#39;re sensed as threat so their energy put out signals your own natural intuition and warning senses to alert you of a persence. If a tree falls in the woods and no one around to hear it does it make a sound????  <br>No, because without anyone around it doesnt have to warn you of the potential danger also if no one around perhaps trees are doing a bit better than they would be if someone around. They don&#39;t need us to survive but we were taught we needed them. Honestly the ocean algae produces more of what we need to breathe than trees and not all trees benefit our breathing and if not native to the land and many left aren&#39;t they actually destroy environment and drink up all the water like palm trees where they don&#39;t belong terrible for other native plants drinking all theirs and our water. By trying to alter nature&#39;s natural course for path in anyway you&#39;re playing God or Universe maker. To gain control is to stop forcing ourselves on everuthingband everyone else. We must let go<br>Past=Memory(hallucination that changes over time and when it passes it&#39;s over cannot change it you&#39;ll only miss the little moments and they&#39;re why we&#39;re here. so why hang onto past larger moments??? Is this benefiting you, yours not who you were a second ago and now that moment is in the past alreafy see how quickly your time here actually goes by but if you are present for each little moment you won&#39;t miss a thing and will see and experience so much more and not just more but more of the good here on \ud83c\udf0e.<br>Present=this very instant(reality)<br>Each little moment of each second( and alit can happen and change in an instant and then it&#39;s just the past again and nothing cam change that, so why let past alter your present.<br>What emotion does the past often have you feeling?<br>What about the future? This you can control to an extent bit to do so you must pay attention to present reality each little moment or you might miss gift needed to help you as you head into your future where honestly anything can happen you have no control but you do have control to be self aware in present to see what you need to as you venture into the chaos we call our future. <br>Do what feels right for you because each journey is an individual one and non is random so listen to your true self it talks to you when it important. Your mind will ramble don&#39;t let it, a quiet mind is a healthy mind and you&#39;re present and in control of your thoughts and emotions open to the present.<br>A mind that goes on and on talking about the past that already happened cannot be changed or altered no matter what you do or say or how long you think or replay it, would you do that in a movie. Would you watch a movie that kept replaying same scene repeatedly?<br>Everything we see and experience is in past, and future is full of sooo many variables that no matter what you do , because of the unpredictability of nature you will never be able to control for certain any moment at any time, also no matter what you do , there&#39;s other people sharing the space as you though living totally different reality. Our worlds collid constantly with others , feels like same present reality if i share elevator with you but it&#39;s no, and never will be and that&#39;s ok, that&#39;s what makes it so special and intetesting. That&#39;s why purpose of life is simple...just be present and grateful for the opportunity and experiences. None lasted too long and always have 3 options and even an option to be physically here but actually somewhere else if somehow chaos causes me to become a part of someone&#39;s journey and it hurts me simply because somehow we&#39;re all here for a journey but is it your journey I&#39;m here for or you to mine? Or .............<br><br><br><br><br><br>Remember though in same present moment sharing same space my reality isn&#39;t your reality and yours not mine and  it&#39;s ok, it&#39;s not suppose to be the same.<br>Our journeys are different and yet also the same fundamentally.<br>Future=Imagination( Hallucination)<br><br><br>Like with a resucue<br>Dog you ask yourself. After a while wait who really saved who? <br>Often it&#39;s mutual and were drawn to each other but our false ego tells us we&#39;re saving the dog from shelte, but dog better equip for his journey , it&#39;s the humans that struggle for survival every second not because they really have to but they are attacking themselves constantly and not allowing themselves to move on and forward so growth and evolution and creative intuition and special connections can be made so that species help each other to survive not destroy ourselves and eachother till extinct because living in past on repeat worried about someone else&#39;s journey disrupting our own and others.", "comment_date": "2021-12-27T21:26:34Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Sierra Baughman", "comment_text": "How is it they came up with this concept about nuclear residue from WW11 for aging whales in April 2019 oh and malaria in May didn&#39;t Bill Gates just come out with pill or vaccine to help 60-75% effective, currently using in Africa", "comment_date": "2021-12-27T20:00:32Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "birdbeep1s", "comment_text": "sobs in wading model,, fun fact!! the evidence shown to prove that the Spinosaurus was fully or semi-aquatic didn&#39;t really hold up, while evidence for a wading-type lifestyle proved much more sound. it&#39;s 1000% more likely that the Spinosaurus lived near bodies of water, catching prey as it swam/flew by", "comment_date": "2021-12-14T02:40:03Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "101ABN327", "comment_text": "I didn&#39;t miss anything because of covid...", "comment_date": "2021-12-12T14:31:24Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Jebrem Ocampo", "comment_text": "Honestly, even if there wasn&#39;t a pandemic, I still would have missed it", "comment_date": "2021-12-11T03:23:33Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Ares Nuth", "comment_text": "I unfortunately all of this", "comment_date": "2021-12-10T04:11:47Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "John Wayne Government Contracts", "comment_text": "Please stop...... stop being so loud for no reason......

Finding some bones that you assume are from a specific dinosaur, and comparing them to crocodile bones is not science. It&#39;s pure imagination. Just as Doctor Who fans for example like to make all sorts of assumptions about meanings in the show. Speculation is not science, my friend. Dinosaur lovers can speculate all they want, but that doesn&#39;t make it science. Yes I know and believe that there were creatures in the past unknown to us today as dinosaurs. But learn to differentiate between science and speculation or hypothesis.<br><br>Two... dating the past again is not science. Yes I know that carbon dating uses chemistry and mathematics to assume the date. But it&#39;s nothing scientific and concrete. In science it is assumed that you can prove something stintically concrete, carbon dating is just pure hypothesis, no one can prove that carbon 14 loss is linear over years, there are a lot of problems in dating things, so carbon dating can be 99999+ years off. No one can say with certainty if an object that shows carbon dating as 100000 years old is not only 4000 years old. We can&#39;t check. So we&#39;re just guessing, nothing is definite. It&#39;s just more hypothesis for hypothesis lovers and speculators.<br><br>Three... you can tell there&#39;s a little science here.

The position of the nostrils is not supportive of an aquatic hunter, it&#39;s in the middle of the muzzle much like a stork, not at the end like on a crocodile or a hippo, animals that spend most of their time in the water. Meaning it would have to raise most of it&#39;s head out of the water every time it needed to take a breath instead of just the very end of it&#39;s muzzle the way hippos and crocodiles do. If it&#39;s a wading hunter, it can keep the bottom half of it&#39;s muzzle in the water and still be able to breathe while it feels around for food. It likely strikes at prey the way herons and storks do. It&#39;s got the right neck length and head shape for that.<br><br>Additionally, with the sail-like structure on their backs, the spinosaurus would have to be swimming at depths of 20+ meters in order to negate the drag created by the waves.

Alright.  Just to give you some perspective on who we&#39;re talking about when it comes to these <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OkbCS9C-8_E&amp;t=1m10s\">1:10</a> fossils going missing.<br><br>So picture this, you&#39;re a young archaeologist and you&#39;re on a dig site known to produce.  Your professor who has taught you everything you know and taken you to a few digsites before has told you to bring everything you find straight to him, so you do.  Well, you&#39;re digging and digging and by accident you stumble upon a 3/4 completion of a skull of a dinosaur you can&#39;t recognize.  You call over your professor and it&#39;s hailed as the biggest find of the day, it&#39;s extracted by hand, put on a truck and you never see it again.  This kind of thing happens to people.  Some bones have gone completely unaccounted for, and that&#39;s devastating to the historical record we need to piece together the evolutionary trees of our ancestors.  But certain men took it upon themselves to skip the scientific process and approach their studies with preconceived notions about the historical record, and this has <b>frequently</b> resulted in people &quot;losing&quot; artifacts.  Some of the pyramid sites in Peru for example have been rife with accusations of destruction of artifacts and important markers which no longer exist.  <br><br>The fact that nobody cracked down on the guys digging these bones up and choosing what to make public, or keep in a private collection, or destroy entirely, is a tragedy to humanity.  Getting rid of or altering the record left behind by pure coincidence isn&#39;t something that was ever rare in this field of study.  It happened frequently and when one team seems to get onto the trail of something, there always seems to be another team who comes out of nowhere to say otherwise.  Which typically is good, but when it comes to people arguing, they only want to prove themselves right.  They don&#39;t want to prove the historical record anymore than they want to see the other team defeated in some sense.  Humanity is naturally competitive which is a great thing, we&#39;ve come far because of it, but we&#39;ve also really shot ourselves in the foot a lot because of it.  <br><br>I like boiling it down to &quot;It was lost in WWII&quot; because that really is the best we can say.  I suspect there&#39;s more to the story than that and I&#39;m sure it&#39;s a very interesting one.
