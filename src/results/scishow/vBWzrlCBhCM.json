It would be a biological conundrum if nematodes were much older than that, for that would directly refute molecular clock analysis and it would provide a complication regarding the current phylogeny of metazoans. If they truly are this old, color me impressed, but current empirical data are in agreement with the notion that they may be between 500-400 million years old (at least the phylum is that old). There is currently no evidence that supports the idea that they may be billions of years old, thus it is misleading to say that they could be billions of years old instead of only stating their current estimates.", "comment_date": "2020-01-20T03:25:29Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Angie Lee", "comment_text": "anyone else see the thumbnail 2this video &amp; for a split sec thought it was a throw back of some Disney channel shows/movies from the early 2000s lmao.
