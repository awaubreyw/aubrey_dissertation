These trees were now situated right on the water&#39;s edge, and stood at or near their full height, but without their bark or branches. The lower portions were stained dark brown and had been smoothed out, while the upper portions had become dry and had cracked surfaces. In areas at the top of the root system, there were holes where the tree had been hollowed out, and whole groups of wharf crabs had taken up residence inside the trees, scurrying into the hollow portion and then up into the trunk at the first sign of danger. If you knocked on the trunk, the little wharf crabs would scurry around, just barely audible. When they were outside the trees, they mainly wandered in reeds and other plants at the water&#39;s edge.
