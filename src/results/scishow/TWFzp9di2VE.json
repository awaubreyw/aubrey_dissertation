But I want to say that I remember seeing something or reading something about this years and years ago in some psychology something or other. I studied psychology briefly. But I remember the key is in the facial proportions. The large eyes relative to the size of the head is similar to the face of a baby, with similarly large eyes for its head since our eyes grow very little throughout our life, or not at all, I&#39;ve heard both. So I&#39;d definitely factcheck that. But my point is the whole big-eyed puppy dog reminds people subconsciously of babies and sort of brings out those nurturing loving instincts that we normally reserve for children.<br><br>This doesn&#39;t just apply to puppies, but basically anything with a face. It depends entirely on the ratio of the sizes of the various facial features. Among other things, I&#39;m sure. But what I remember focused on the ratio of the sizes. There&#39;s more to it than just the eyes, too. I know a small nose is also a feature that reminds people of babies. It&#39;s actually really interesting to consider the ratio of the size of facial features and body parts in general. They&#39;re always more or less the same in everybody. Like if you took your thumb right now, it&#39;s going to be exactly the same length as your nose (usually) and it will be 3x the length of your face from your forehead to your chin. Your forehead is exactly 1 thumblength, your nose is 1 more thumblength and from under your nose to your chin is another thumblength. It&#39;s pretty wild if you&#39;ve never heard about it. But the same thing can be applied to just about every part of your body. Unfortunately I learned about this a long time ago so I don&#39;t recall everything. But you can look it up easily enough if you want to know more of these ratios.<br><br>Actually if any of you recall the DaVinci drawing of the Vitruvian Man where it&#39;s got that guy with his arms and legs spread out and there&#39;s a circle within a square around him and all sorts of other lines and stuff. That&#39;s exactly what DaVinci was showing in that picture. He was showing all of the various ratios of the parts of the human body. So it might be worth looking at that too if you&#39;re interested in it.", "comment_date": "2022-05-31T17:41:57Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "TheEternalPheonix", "comment_text": "Withoiut actually having watched the video I can firmly say they aren&#39;t.
