Data. Is. So. Important. For. AI. To. Work. Right. SO IMPORTANT. Not only the amount of data, but the quality and diversity of data, too. An AI can only learn from what it&#39;s trained on, it has no other experiences, so if your data doesn&#39;t represent all the types of data it will see &quot;in the wild&quot;, it won&#39;t do a good job with that data that lies outside what it was trained on. Poor training data is how you get things like &quot;racist AIs&quot; that have trouble recognizing people of color, for instance. It&#39;s not that the AI is racist, it&#39;s that most of its training data was white people, so it doesn&#39;t understand anything else nearly as well as it understands white people.<br><br>The relevance, in case I wasn&#39;t clear, is in the way giving the earthquake AI training data from the study produced a significantly more accurate AI just a year later. That trend will continue: better training data = a better AI.<br><br>Interesting side note: this doesn&#39;t just apply to machine learning. It applies to people as well. Babies and young kids are ignorant of many things because they don&#39;t have enough training data. But reciting the common idea that older = wiser is also untrue, because many adults are ignorant (often dangerously so) despite their large amount of data because their data <b>wasn&#39;t varied enough.</b> In machine learning terminology, they had a large training set of poor quality data. You need a lot of data, but <b>it must be diverse and high-quality</b> data as well, otherwise both machines and humans fail to understand reality.", "comment_date": "2021-09-27T22:06:00Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Scribe13", "comment_text": "Earthquakes are the planet&#39;s way of staying harmonically...groovy", "comment_date": "2021-09-27T22:04:23Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Megatron Jenkins", "comment_text": "I got to be Like <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23666\">#666</a>.
