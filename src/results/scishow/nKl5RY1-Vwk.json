When a cow is treated with penicillin it appears in the milk for a period afterward.  The FDA says you can&#39;t sell that milk commercially because some people (like me) are allergic to penicillin and could have a random bad reaction to a glass of milk.  The company coated micron-sized spheres of latex with antibodies specific to penicillin and then mixed it with a sample of the milk.  If there was the drug present in the milk the latex spheres would clump together in a process called agglutination, causing the sample to go from cloudy to clear with white clumps.  The same process is used these days for pregnancy tests and rapid blood type testing.  The process is quite versatile; you can coat the latex spheres with antibodies specific for practically any protein. <br><br>Here&#39;s a video I found illustrating how latex agglutination works: <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oXL1rH11MTg\">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oXL1rH11MTg</a>", "comment_date": "2021-03-03T06:18:39Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Chinmayi", "comment_text": "Happy World Wildlife Day!", "comment_date": "2021-03-03T06:13:04Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Alex Rydin", "comment_text": "Rose was a great addition, feels like she\u2019s always been around.", "comment_date": "2021-03-03T05:20:15Z", "likes_count": 8}, {"comment_by": "Mike Stewart", "comment_text": "Great job Rose.
