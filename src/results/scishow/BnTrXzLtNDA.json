They&#39;re largely very sociable with each other when food isn&#39;t a concern yet still harbor territorial misgivings depending on their age, sex, family status and current claims to access. I&#39;ve gathered a small number of them into my favoring while a decent number of others still merely take advantage of the excess available food. They can come to understand words, especially when they&#39;re consistent to a certain pitch. They&#39;re also, from my experience so far, careful about leaving refuse behind once they invest in a location. It&#39;s where they eat and cross paths so I imagine most times they prefer to do their leavings in private out of the way places.<br><br>What I find so nice about them and other regional wildlife is the degree you can gain something back from fostering their interests. While they&#39;re all rascals, every last creature, they return something with considerable access.

Anyway, I tried looking up info on them one day and all sources I could check list them as carnivores but they eat rice on a daily basis, they&#39;ve been raiding the trash my entire life. There&#39;s also no mention of them being able to change color.<br><br>I&#39;ve tried asking around in forums and most people had the theory that rice looks like maggots, but no, they also know that we keep rice in rice cooker appliances, aside from them raiding the trash. They also know which food they can/cannot eat inside the trash bins. I started regularly feeding them as an experiment and they show up almost on a schedule, at lunch. Since they live with humans, it makes sense that it was only a matter of time before they adapted to eating human food.<br><br>For the color changing. I&#39;ve only witnessed the lizards changing twice, but still, I couldn&#39;t find any mention of this anywhere... Most, if not all, outdoor house geckos (yeah, they are still in the premises but outdoors) are darker in color and may also have bumpy skin, assuming it&#39;s for camouflage. But every indoor house gecko is lighter in color, as shown in Wikipedia. I&#39;ve been wondering if they were separate species but I couldn&#39;t find any info at all about the darker ones that are outside. Turns out they&#39;re the same lizard. Once they are inside, in the shade, they turn from a dark color into the regular color and may also lose the bumps on their skin.<br><br>So yeah, either these creatures are underappreciated or just severely understudied. They are well-adapted to living indoors (or in the vicinity of houses) and they&#39;re pretty much everywhere in the city.
