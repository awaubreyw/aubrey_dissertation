[{"comment_by": "Darrell Baker", "comment_text": "If we are looking at the same study, the observations were made of soda treatment for gill injuries in fish. However, many bass fisherman use the technique for gullet-hooked fish that bleed from their injury, not gill injuries which are FAR more lethal. The soda is poured into the fish&#39;s mouth and not &quot;on them&quot;. It seems to work. The fish are kept in a live well to verify their survival before release. Consider the possibility that slowing the blood flow, even if only temporarily, provides an opportunity for the blood to naturally coagulate at the wound site, preventing the fish from bleeding out.", "comment_date": "2022-06-19T21:57:32Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "In search of perch", "comment_text": "I find mountain dew has saved loads of fish for me", "comment_date": "2021-08-13T12:55:24Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Doogan Doggin", "comment_text": "Could the sugar help with glucose depletion from fighting?
