This leaves the C with a delta positive charge. This then induces a slight positive charge on the H to which that C is bonded to. Thus, H has a greater attraction to nearby O, which is delta negatively charged. Somewhat similar to having electron withdrawing groups in a molecule.<br>Also, something to question/but I may be wrong: the C is bonded to a N of an amide. Due to amides resonance structure, we can say the O of the amide is electron withdrawing, and thus results in the delta positive N of the amide. This then pulls more electron density from the C, which then does to the H &quot;2 bonds away&quot;. Thus, the H on that C bonded to the amide (aka. peptide bond in proteins) is not like a H on a pure hydrocarbon, like an alkane, etc.<br>Maybe we have to consider the effect of an electronegative atom/electron-withdrawing group that may not be directly bonded to the H, but 2 or even 3 bonds away (especially in a resonance system with delocalised pi electrons). Just like how the chemical shift (ppm) of the H in 1H-NMR, is effected by atoms 2 or 3 bonds away? But I may be wrong as the inductive effect drops significantly past one bond.<br><br>Anyway, thanks for reading my thoughts -  I may be completely wrong though, but as a student myself, I love chemistry!", "comment_date": "2021-11-12T06:18:00Z", "likes_count": 7}, {"comment_by": "Ryan Rollins", "comment_text": "getting fit again! keep it up!", "comment_date": "2021-11-12T06:13:02Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Chloe Peifly", "comment_text": "can we get great minds pins!!", "comment_date": "2021-11-12T05:51:35Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Sevrin Tiger", "comment_text": "Because of course a woman can&#39;t discover things that a man has dismissed as imposible...", "comment_date": "2021-11-12T05:28:24Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "djthegrateone", "comment_text": "Would that make a hydrocarbon?", "comment_date": "2021-11-12T05:16:19Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Irtaza Azam", "comment_text": "Choo choo", "comment_date": "2021-11-12T05:12:17Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "chknoodle", "comment_text": "That title card is trying so hard to say &quot;CHOO CHOO&quot;. \ud83d\ude82", "comment_date": "2021-11-12T05:08:45Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Chris Williams", "comment_text": "And that&#39;s why it&#39;s said that &quot;Truth alone prevails&quot;.", "comment_date": "2021-11-12T05:04:32Z", "likes_count": 3}, {"comment_by": "Allan Alach", "comment_text": "Very impressed that you used the Aotearoa New Zealand combination.
