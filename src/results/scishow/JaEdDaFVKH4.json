They are called fissile.</b> &quot;Fissionable&quot; means they can be fissioned by a neutron. &quot;Fissile&quot; means they can sustain a chain reaction [3]. <br><br>-&quot;T-232 isn&#39;t fissionable.&quot; <b>Thorium&#39;s atomic symbol is &quot;Th,&quot; not &quot;T&quot; and Th-232 absolutely is fissionable, it just isn&#39;t fissile [3,4].</b> <br><br>-&quot;When T-232 is hit by a neutron, it turns into T-233, and that&#39;s fissionable.&quot; Even if I accept your incorrect definition of &quot;fissionable&quot; and your incorrect atomic symbol for thorium, this statement is false. <b>Adding a neutron to Th-232 turns it into Th-233, but Th-233 then decays into U-233, which is fissile (what you wrongly call &quot;fissionable&quot;) [2].</b><br><br>-<b>The implication that thorium&#39;s ability to breed fuel makes it different from standard nuclear fuel is wrong.</b> Uranium-plutonium reactors can also breed their own fuels while also fissioning away their high-actinide waste in a fast breeder reactor [2]. Idaho National Laboratories demonstrated this in the EBR-II reactor back in the 1980s[5]. <br><br>-<b>The distinct issue with high-actinide waste is not its toxicity, but its radioactivity.</b> Solar photovoltaic plants produce a lot more toxic waste than nuclear plants, but it&#39;s chemically toxic, not radioactive, so it will also be around in thousands of years.<br><br>-&quot;Most uranium in nature is in a nearly-unusable form called U-238.&quot; U-238 is fertile, just like Th-232 is, so it&#39;s just as useful as Th-232 in nuclear applications [2]. More so, in fact, since we actually do breed U-238 into Pu-239 fuel in far greater quantities than we breed Th-232 into U-233. U-238 is also handy as a high-density material in non-nuclear applications. <br><br>-&quot;Enriching the uranium is hard.&quot; <b>True, but it&#39;s also not required.</b> See heavy water reactor designs like the CANDU [6].<br><br>-&quot;The upshot is that thorium can be dug up and put in a reactor with a lot less effort than uranium, once you have the right kind of reactor.&quot;  *This is not true; we can use natural uranium as a fuel in several reactor designs right now; thorium is no more easy to put into a reactor than uranium [2]. <br><br>-&quot;Every major nuclear power disaster has been due to a cooling failure.&quot; This is incorrect. Chernobyl was caused by a runaway supercritical chain reaction, loss-of-cooling [7]. So was the SL-1 accident in Idaho [8]. <br><br>-&quot;if [water cooling] fails, you can get a meltdown, like what happened at Fukushima or Chernobyl.&quot; Chernobyl was a runaway supercritical chain reaction. There was plenty of cooling water flowing through it right before it blew.<br><br><b>This video presents passive cooling as if it were exclusive to the thorium MSR concept. It&#39;s not. [2,5].</b><br><br>-&quot;Since Uranium was much more useful for making nuclear bombs...&quot; <b>That&#39;s not why we researched uranium and plutonium as nuclear fuels first. We used uranium and plutonium first because uranium-235 is the only naturally-occurring fissile isotope [9].</b> By the way, you can absolutely make bombs from Thorium, too, and the U.S. did exactly that [10].<br><br>-&quot;...Like the betamax vs VHS fight&quot; <b>would only be a good metaphor if betamax could not exist without having VHS around first.</b> Without already having plenty of fissile nuclear fuel from U-235, you can&#39;t do anything with thorium. Nuclear reactors could never exist without U-235.<br><br><b>Please, SciShow, do your homework or at least talk to a competent nuclear engineer.</b> Thorium offers two key intrinsic advantages: it can be bred with thermal neutrons, and when bred into U-233 and fissioned, it produces less high-actinide waste. On the downside, they require more shielding, and there&#39;s a lot less experience and knowledge about them because they&#39;ve never existed outside some experimental test-beds. <br><br><b>Disclaimer: I&#39;m actually for thorium, but it&#39;s important to discern the relevant facts from the hype, and all this video is likely to do is muddy the waters even further.</b><br><br><b>Sources:</b><br>[1] <a href=\"https://ourworldindata.org/safest-sources-of-energy\">https://ourworldindata.org/safest-sources-of-energy</a><br>[2] <a href=\"https://whatisnuclear.com/thorium-myths.html\">https://whatisnuclear.com/thorium-myths.html</a><br>[3] <a href=\"https://www.open.edu/openlearn/science-maths-technology/unclear-about-nuclear/content-section-4.5\">https://www.open.edu/openlearn/science-maths-technology/unclear-about-nuclear/content-section-4.5</a><br>[4] <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thorium\">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thorium</a><br>[5] <a href=\"https://www.ne.anl.gov/About/reactors/frt.shtml\">https://www.ne.anl.gov/About/reactors/frt.shtml</a><br>[6] <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CANDU_reactor\">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CANDU_reactor</a><br>[7] <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chernobyl_disaster\">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chernobyl_disaster</a><br>[8] <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SL-1\">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SL-1</a><br>[9] <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uranium-235\">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uranium-235</a><br>[10] <a href=\"https://www.armscontrolwonk.com/archive/604629/just-because-no-one-does-it-anymore-doesnt-mean-it-doesnt-work/\">https://www.armscontrolwonk.com/archive/604629/just-because-no-one-does-it-anymore-doesnt-mean-it-doesnt-work/</a>", "comment_date": "2021-08-18T20:54:27Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Clark Kent", "comment_text": "First, this technology is not new and never advanced beyond the research reactor phase.

However, you need a neutron with a high enough kinetic energy to cause the fission to occur.  More often than not, the neutrons don&#39;t have that energy and instead Th232 and U238 end up absorbing the neutron becoming Th233 and U239.  Now, it&#39;s possible for the next incident neutron to hit these nucleui to cause a fission (fissile means any incident neutron can cause a fission).  The reason why Th233 doesn&#39;t appear to fission is because the cross sectional area of the nucleus is much lower than the decay process that eventually leads to U233.<br><br>Also, for those going on about Thorium being known by some people for 5 years...we Nuclear Engineers have known about it for decades.  The thing that people don&#39;t understand is that due to treaties like the Non-Proliferation Treaty, converting and breeding fissile material is not something that it looked at/allowed.  With Uranium 238 to Plutonium 239, it&#39;s really very easy to separate the two through chemical means.  The one <b>claim</b> about why Thorium isn&#39;t an issue is due to the n,2n reaction that occurs on occasion where a high energy gamma is released after ~70days and you end up with U232 instead.  I see people go on that because of this, no one would want to reprocess U233 for bombs, but the simple truth is this, if a bad actor wants it bad enough, they will get it.<br><br>Also, lets not call what comes out of reactors at each refueling cycle waste, and instead call it its proper name, *SPENT FUEL*.

Of the remaining 5%, most of that, or roughly 4% to 4.5% of the total spent fuel, is usable either medicinally (tracers, cancer treatments, etc) or industrially.  Less than 1% of the spent fuel is truly waste and there&#39;s no use for it.  Funnily enough, this actual waste, the longest lived half lifes are ~100 years.  Thus if spent fuel was reprocessed, the truly useless junk, which only makes up about 1% of the spent fuel, could easily be isolated and store for ~1000 years before it was safe (and likely half that amount of time).<br><br>Enrichment of U235 is hard if you don&#39;t have the proper technology.  If you&#39;re depending on diffusion or centrifuges it&#39;s hard, however, there are other technologies that have been available since the late 80s that can drastically speed up enrichment.  These technologies are highly watched however so I will not go into what they are, but I do know that one of the technologies can get almost 100% enrichment on a single pass (don&#39;t ask, I won&#39;t tell you as I am very much against nuclear weapons, but very much for nuclear power).<br><br>One accidents, the big thing with water reactors is the pressures.  Also, all of the major accidents to date have been with Gen 1 reactor designs.  Presently, we are using Gen 3 designs and early Gen 4 designs for new reactors being built.  Ever since late Gen 2 and onward designs, a lot of water reactors have had a number of passive control systems instituted.  In just about every late Gen 2 onward design, it would take an act over sabotage to melt down a reactor.  Also every major accident to date can also be directly faulted at human actions.  Windscale was improper carbon anneling, TMI 2 was maintenance worker leaving a value closed after maintenance and operators miss reading the panels, Chernobyl was 100% on management of the plant for forcing the scientists and engineers going forward with the test even though the scientists and engineers needed the reactor to be shutdown for 8 hours before running the test, and Fukushima was 100% at the feet of accountants not wanting to spend the money to place the backup generators a minimum of 10M off the ground to keep the water circulation pumps running.<br><br>The biggest advantage that Thorium has over Uranium is Thorium is literally <b>everywhere</b> on Earth where as Uranium is not.<br><br>TLDR - please research better before putting out something like this.", "comment_date": "2021-08-02T18:59:37Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Thomas ferris", "comment_text": "About time people start talking about this", "comment_date": "2021-08-02T18:59:26Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Tayton Keller", "comment_text": "Sam\u2019o\u2019!Nella made a video about this like 3-4 years ago", "comment_date": "2021-08-02T17:37:06Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "X88B88", "comment_text": "I love you.", "comment_date": "2021-08-02T16:58:55Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "14loosecannon", "comment_text": "There was a lot of buzz about this when I studied undergrad physics, which was about 10 years ago!", "comment_date": "2021-08-02T15:59:43Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Ajay Ajay", "comment_text": "Too late now....

I understand they point of the video is to boil down the topic so it\u2019s easier to understand, but to the extent they went, it\u2019s misleading. Firstly, natural uranium can be used as fuel. No enrichment needed. Many Canadian reactors are able to use uranium straight out of uranium ground as fuel. The vast majority of research / energy producing reactors do use some flavor of enriched uranium. The reactor I work with uses LEU fuel. Aka, low enriched uranium. It does have a higher abundance of U-235, that being said, it\u2019s still mostly U-238 and the various decay products. It is true that U-235 produces long lived radioactive isotopes like protactinium and actinium that have half lives of 33,000 and 22 years, respectively. What was not brought up is that Th-233 will eventually decay into U-233 and Th-229 with half lives of 160,000 and 7,400 years, respectively. Lastly, not that there isn\u2019t more to say, bringing up that the LWR designs principle date back to the 50\u2019s makes it seem like there\u2019s something inherently wrong with the design. The designs for plants have indeed changed significantly from the 50\u2019s. The idea behind how they produce electricity is the same. Like any steam based electrical plant, you heat water to the point it boils and pass the steam through a turbine which spins a magnet and makes electricity.

First, it has to undergo two beta decays, changing first (half-life 22 minutes) to protactinium-233 and then (half-life 28 days) to U-233.  U-233 is the fissile.

That only means the atom splits.  You need it to emit at least two neutrons with the splitting - such a material is termed &quot;fissile&quot;.  U-235 is fissile with slow neutrons.  U-238 is fissionable with high-energy neutrons - it splits but won&#39;t sustain a chain reaction.  <br><br>Fourthly, it makes its own fuel only by converting Th-232.

Nevertheless, replacing all existing PWRs with SNF burning MSRs using the SNF stored at these sites could be an excellent starting point.

Amazing read.<br><br>As for &quot;meaningful power&quot;, MSR&#39;s have been tested thoroughly. An MSR was designed as the choice for America&#39;s ill-fated nuclear powered bomber. On the test stand, it made more than enough thrust. And an MSR holds the record at oak ridge for the longest run, most reliable reactor they ever tested.<br><br>Molten salt breeder reactors also have the benefit of burning our current uranium and plutonium waste. They are pretty ravenous. And they make practically zero waste themselves.<br><br>They can also be used to very specifically make isotopes that we otherwise needed specialty reactors to make, such as isotopes required for research or cancer treatment. <br><br>Also, the explosions at Chernobyl/Fukushima were not steam explosions. They were hydrogen explosions. The reactor fuel was not cooled, so they &quot;melted down&quot;. The heat was so strong that the water that WAS around them was ripped into hydrogen and oxygen, and eventually detonated. That&#39;s why Fukushima vented the building several times. To get rid of hydrogen.<br><br>There is really only one noteworthy flaw in an MSR design - the flouride or sodium used for the fuel medium, while it does have the HUGE benefit of being at atmospheric pressure and inherently just runs at it&#39;s ideal operating temp and cannot &quot;run away&quot;, the F/Na are corrosive to pipes, so they would need specific maintenance. Radiation also embrittled metal, so it&#39;s just a field of study that needs more looking into. But the tech, as it stands, is market-ready. The reason you don&#39;t see them is because of public perception, political stonewalling and lack of subsidies like fossil fuels and renewables get, and the fact that the plants are slow and expensive to build. So the only people who will subsidize your plant are the people who make your fuel, and thorium just isn&#39;t something that needs as much care as uranium fuel rods, so the cost just isn&#39;t there for fuel manufacturers.<br><br>But another benefit of the MSR is they don&#39;t require a lot of the hyper expensive and difficult manufacturing that a pressurized reactor does. Any pressurized reactor needs a containment vessel. These can only be made at one steel mill on earth in Japan. And they wear out from embrittlement too. MSR&#39;s are also more modular, so they can be smaller scaled, and since they can&#39;t be used for nuclear proliferation, are ideal for remote or developing countries.<br><br>The biggest failing of science YouTube educators, this video included, is that they just don&#39;t talk about the brutal realities of nuclear. Nuclear power kills even fewer people than any renewable short of geothermal. Even our current, ancient reactors are ABJECTLY RIDICULOUSLY SAFE when compared to every other form of power generation in the world. And current designs of light water reactors that we haven&#39;t built yet are even orders of magnitude safer than that. Chernobyl was an example of soviet idiocy and cost engineering. Fukushima was a political s**tshow and they didn&#39;t even follow the american reactor manufacturer&#39;s recommendations to keep the backup generators ABOVE SEA LEVEL - which would have completely eliminated the meltdown.<br><br>And in addition to safety, the simple fact is that as the world sits today, there is no green energy future without nuclear. 100% renewable just isn&#39;t going to work without a stable base load that nuclear can happily carry. Nuclear reactors are just as green as all modern renewables, and a LOT greener than chemical battery banks.<br><br>The world will never go truly carbon neutral without nuclear to foot the burden.

The real question is not a question of uranium vs. thorium, but however the benefits of a molten salt reactor (MSR) over  existing light water reactors.  Below is a link for an article by Dr Ondrej Chvala, Research Assistant Professor in the Department of Nuclear Engineering at the University of Tennessee listing the benefits of MSRs.  Molten Salt Reactors can use uranium, thorium or even plutonium as their fuel.  In my opinion the best design for a molten salt reactor is the Molten Chloride Salt Fast Reactor (MCSFR) being developed by Elysium Industries and Mr. Ed Pheil.   This MSR actually utilizes the spent nuclear fuel (aka nuclear waste) from existing light water reactors.  Using the existing supply of spent nuclear fuel, MCSFRs could supply all the energy needs of the US for hundreds to thousands of years without mining any additional uranium or thorium.

The reason why U-238 or Th-232 is not used is because its extremely expensive to operate breeder reactors.

Neutron poisons are isotopes created during the reactions to convert Th-232 or U-238 to fissile U-233 or Pu-239. They have to be removed. There are some experimental reactors that use Molten Salts so that the poisons can be removed in-situ, but these was never practical because some major problems that just make the costs too expensive.<br>3.

Nuclear &quot;waste&quot; can be reprocessed back into more fuel, the amount of actual waste is stupidly small, it&#39;s just padded out with tons of unspent uranium.  The issue is that at least in the USA reprocessing of fuel is illegal, out of fear for weapons proliferation.  MSR&#39;s are another great option, they can burn the nuclear &quot;waste&quot; and generate loads of electricity from it.<br><br>Fear of radiation itself is also overblown.  Accident&#39;s bring to mind veritable wastelands where nothing grows, it couldn&#39;t be further from the truth.  While the fallout zone of chernobyl is considered unfit for humankind, nature has no issue there.  The area around chernobyl has flourished.  It turns out just our presence is more of a detriment to wildlife than the radiation is.
