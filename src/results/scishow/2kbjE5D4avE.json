Running to every high tech solution saying we need to do this without considering the costs and benefit is a bad idea.<br>We ignore problematic ag practices that increase CO2 through bare earth plowing practices; CAFOs; overgrazing; monocropping; chemical input dependent annual food crops; etc; that directly contribute to flooding, the need for electrical water pumping and brownouts; freshwater shortages; food deserts, reduced nutrition, lack of food diversity, food scarcity;  loss of crucial soil biota including mycelium; -aerosolized CO2 and topsoil* loss.  <br>In large areas of the world farmers plow in the Fall and leave bare soil that allows carbon-rich topsoil to be lost <b>to the air.</b>  Come late spring they may replant annual crops if conditions are a suitable or leave the soil bare longer still if they aren&#39;t.  That is a huge contributor to climate warming.  In 2017(?) Only 75% of grain crops were planted in the US because conditions were wrong for planting until it was too late.<br>Conventional organic- and chemical- ag practices indirectly contribute to drought, heat waves, loss of wildlife, flood claims, loss of life, wildfires; loss of resiliency; etc.<br>(&#39;sustainable ag&#39; is a greenwashing term), drought, heat wave, flooding, food deserts, lack of food diversity, poor nutrition, our topsoils are nearly depleted (it&#39;s estimated topsoil will be gone in 45 years).<br>We&#39;re told we need desalination plants! (imagine putting out a fire with desalinated water!); big canals and water pumps!; electric cars!; shade the atmosphere with chemicals! (Kind of how we got into trouble);  carbon tax! (lol!); etc! --no matter the long term environmental cost or the problems this locked-up carbon may cause elsewhere, including &#39;what if we need that carbon readily again and opps we did too good a job locking it??&#39; <br>This tech prices out the poor, and makes the middle class smaller as well and the politicians and tech mega corporate conglomerates  will say&#39;&#39;because &#39;You asked for it!&#39;&quot;, and turn around and commit your money to another lousy solution.<br>We know that &#39;global warming solutions and policies&#39; by bigwigs are money and power grabs.   Politicians glad-hand then divert money to dubious tech solutions that picks taxpayer pockets while globalist elitists get richer.  Greenwashing politicians have yet to be seen those pulling their ecological weight like Brad Lancaster and Mark Shepard, let alone in the same room.  Gore and Obama claimed the oceans are rising then bought oceanfront property after selling people on ethanol which proved to be a bigger polluter than a eco solution.  Tech companies profited from selling farmers distilleries while corn prices rose and vehicles deteriorated faster.  These &#39;solutions&#39; result in indentured servitude among the masses. <br>  <br>We need solutions that solve for multiple problems.  Decentralization reduces costs to taxpayers in infrastructure, maintenance, it bypasses/reduces the need for services, is efficient, creates lower tax burden while building localized resiliency.  <br><br>Love the approach proposed by climatologist and soil scientist Walter Jehne.  It is durable, decentralized and cheap.  It uses natural processes that focus on climate cooling through: 1) water sequestration, 2)regreening especially through appropriate trees,  and 3) soil health:<br>1) Due to the loss of soil carbon; as well as the loss of soils; loss of water permeability due to drought, solarization, wind, flooding --means we need to work at rehydrating the land first.<br> Rainwater harvesting earthworks in drylands and elsewhere add drought, fire, flood mitigation as well as favoring healthier soils.  It also recharges aquifers and increases albedo effect, downstream water availability, (the latter seems counterintuitive, but is supported by field studies).  It could increase water accessibility for impoverished/isolated/low rainwater communities thru rainwater harvesting via bioswales, curb cuts, using roof runoff, and greywater.  These can be used to water food trees grown for nuts, fruit and veggies with safety, as problematic chemicals are deposited in the bark, as well as non edible landscaping and lawns.  That&#39;s free water.  That makes a difference for those that refrain from watering because community water is too expensive.  It also reduces grid strain/brownouts because we are now pumping less water this way.  It reduces the need for more stormwater infrastructure costs and maintenance, etc.  It is durable as well.  Swales made in the 1930s by the CCC in the Sonoran desert are still going strong.  Look up the video.  Ethiopia, India, and Australia have been this as well.<br>Brad Lancaster is a great resource  on rainwater harvesting earthworks in drylands.  He has lots of videos and his books give out detailed info.  He has worked in both rural and urban areas.<br>The ideas are scaleable.\u00a0 It includes curb cuts, swales, bunds, gully repair, check dams, etc.<br>Geoff Lawton is another good source to see how it works. <br><br>2) We can add regreen more land than people realize.  People think of the Sahel as a great place for regreening with but we can actually use agricultural land everywhere.  Much of cropland and range land is left vulnerable when it can be planted with food producing, longer-lived perennials, shrubs, vines and trees and grasses <b>in polycultures.</b>  Appropriate trees produce livestock feed, unusual fruits and vegetables, and even timber. We can do this by planting site-appropriate native trees, shrubs, vines (or plants that are closely related to natives are great for this purpose), etc.  Some of the benefits of planting diverse,  site-appropriate trees is more food diversity, food security (more food!), fresh fruits, vegetables, nuts, edible leaves, increase food quality (because now you can get fresh food from your bioswale trees), livestock feed, mulch, shade, farm and gardener resilience, timber, transpiration, beauty.  They sequester carbon and encourage mycelium and other beneficial organisms for better soil health, heat island reduction, flood mitigation, increased albedo effect, decreased pollution, etc.  <br> <br>3) Healthy soil biota is cheaper than conventional inputs and adds to food production; sequesters carbon; retains moisture; remineralizes; reduces flooding and the need to irrigate; and related labor and material costs and replacement; works without machinery/moving part, etc.  <br><br>These are part of regenerative/restorative farming and ranching practices that can found under the heading of &#39;permaculture&#39; when done right.  Permaculturists such as Mark Shepard are showing that it can be done on a larger scale and can be profitable.  Suggest you read his book Restoration Agriculture first.  It explains more on the particulars of his technique.  His longer videos also delve into other areas that are eye opening, such as how it is difficult for independent producers to ship via train because the trains are booked up for the next 20 years...<br>I strongly suggest you watch at least several of Walter Jehne&#39;s videos.  Each makes different points and explains better the different aspects of why climate works.  It&#39;s a stunningly simple concept<br><br>Other decentralized solutions are: 1) harvesting methane (as it has much more immediate effects on climate than CO\u00b2).  Methane currently leaks from oil and water wells; septic tanks and wastewater treatment plants; dairy and CAFO manure ponds.  A simple bladder system to capture methane for use.  <br>Oil companies are big offenders and are doing little to repair methane leaks from oil wells.  We need to harvest it instead.  That on Federal land can support vets that are hiding away from society and campgrounds.  The leaking oil wells on private land can be used by &#39;homesteaders&#39; willing to set up in remote places.  It could be used for heat, cooking and hot water.<br><b>Methane warms the planet on steroids for a decade or two before decaying to CO2.  In those short decades, methane warms the planet by 86 times as much as CO2, according to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change.</b><br>2) Create and use hydrochar to help restore soils depleted by conventional organic- and chemical- ag practices and the surplus hydrochar could be used for low-hazard fuel.  We need wastewater treatment plants anyway. Hydrochar can be cheaper to operate/install than conventional wastewater treatments so this is a good option.  Hydrochar can be made after the methane from livestock, manure, sewage solid waste, <br><br><br>The &#39;centralized&#39; high tech solution <b>that is practical</b> is adding freight and passenger rail in a way similar to Eisenhower&#39;s for the interstate highway system.  It reduces car dependency.  It creates jobs in maintenance, tourism, engineers, creating economic opportunities to ship goods and for otherwise isolated people to travel in underserved communities.  It would reduce gridlock, add accessibility resiliency, reduce emissions, This would solve accessibility issues for poor and disabled, <br> It needs to be methodical and gridded. <br>The US,  Russia, Canada, China, and Australia are wealthy and big polluters and large areas are underserved.   Africa, South America and poorer sections of Asia would also benefit as it would connect them to diverse markets and create accessibility.<br><br>Beyond these methods I&#39;d be really skeptical unless they had mutifold utility and solve more problems than they create.<br><br> *Topsoil is also known as black gold among farmers and gardeners because of its superior qualities.", "comment_date": "2022-08-16T08:46:56Z", "likes_count": 3}, {"comment_by": "Qui9", "comment_text": "What&#39;s this about research ethics?

Whether that is due to soil conditions, topography affecting the ability of machinery to till, plant and harvest, or climate. Especially here in the US. There is also a lot of work being done with regenerative agriculture- using new pasture management and animal management to improve soil quality and bring back native flora. Animal agriculture can also have a lower impact on local fauna because grazing animals can live among native wildlife and those habitats don&#39;t have to be clear cut or destroyed to cultivate crops.<br><br>Another point is that a lot of our food waste is &quot;recycled&quot; back into the food chain through animal agriculture- we can feed cows and other animals crop by products (like soybean hulls, cotton seeds, etc). So calories that would have otherwise been wasted are given to animals who turn it into milk and meat. Not to mention, a lot of human food crops are fertilized with manure from animal agriculture. Without that natural fertilizer, crop farmers would have to rely more on synthetic fertilizers. <br><br>The parameters of this study seem to really skew the &quot;impact&quot; against animal agriculture- but it is difficult to account for all the nuance.
