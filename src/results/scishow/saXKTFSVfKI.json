I had a mare once and she always tried to steal other mares babies she&#39;d call them over and end up getting in trouble with their moms... She knew they were not hers. She just loved babies. Baby horses. And my gelding. He took over my other mares parenting duties. She spent less time being a parent than my gelding lol. That mares foal spent more time playing and having my at the time 17 18 year old gelding dote on him. When the little fella was weaned the first day he tried to nurse from my gelding&#39;s sheath and my gelding put a leg back like the foals mom did and just let the little weanling figure out nothing was happening and then my weanling never tried that again. He guarded the little guy too. He wouldn&#39;t let any other horses get to close. He would chase them away even if the weanling was the one that initiated the encounter. He raised that weanling for the next 3 years and now he&#39;s a 4 year old stallion with an amazing calm mind thanks to my gelding, raising him so well. They r still pastured and stalled right enxt to each other and nicked to each other in a hello when one comes or goes. \ud83e\udd70 Animals know, they don&#39;t always have to even be female or have just had a baby, they just have big hearts like any human would sometimes.

Evolution doesn&#39;t care if you survive or not, it just happens, and the individual living being and/or the entire species are better of because of it (or not, in which case the mutation isn&#39;t kept by way of natural selection), so expecting an animal to not care for other animals&#39; youngs seems to imputate our view on nature to the animals themselves (&quot;nature is cruel, the species that perform best physically get to survive&quot; etc) whilst such cases of solidarity help keep the species alive and even let it prosper as well; animals with highly developed social skills tend to perform better as a species, if not on an individual level. Something akin to what we call &quot;empathy&quot; when referring to our relations with other humans can help a species to prosper, and thus get &quot;selected for&quot; just as well. Especially if we take into account that not all behaviour is inscribed in the genes, and that animals teach their young tricks that they themselves have learned to be useful from their own parents, and during their lifetimes. <br>I feel like being surprised by such things, and searching for a &quot;rational&quot; decision making process, or straight up searching for &quot;dysfunctionalities&quot; in the animal&#39;s behaviour, is mostly a case of imputating a strict reading on how evolution is &quot;supposed&quot; to work, and thusly gives place to a distortion based on our urbanized vision on &quot;the wild&quot;. <br>In a way its not so different from imputating human behaviour on animalia; an otter doesn&#39;t &quot;love&quot; its young, because love as term is for human relations; we can not say with certainty or precision that an otter &quot;loves&quot; its young. The same way we can&#39;t say that it is &quot;in competition with other members of its species&quot;; while trying to minimize distortion on reality caused by our human understanding of things, we risk falling right back into it, only on the other end of the spectrum.", "comment_date": "2021-07-15T13:33:16Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Jeff Rosenbury", "comment_text": "&quot;The Selfish Gene&quot; theory on evolution is compelling.
