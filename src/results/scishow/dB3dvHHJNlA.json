But as the managers told it, the last 5%of the first population took as much effort as the first 95%. As remote a the islands were, it was difficult to get resources out there to hunt the goats and the most efficient way was hunting them in a helicopter. But as their population dwindled and the vegetation returned, the goats got smart and hid when they heard the helicopters. Enter the Judas goat. A female goat was captured, sterilized, tagged with a GPS and infected with hormones to permanently put them in heat and make them irresistibly attract other goats. The Judas goats lived up to their name, condemning many of their fellows and leading to total eradication on most islands.
