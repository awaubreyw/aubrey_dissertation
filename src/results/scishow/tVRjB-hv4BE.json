To me, long COVID is very frightening and we barely hear about it, despite lots and lots of people are still very ill and receive few or any appropriate cure for it, despite the vaccine itself can help some people with it.

That&#39;s right, you cannot enter Australia unless you are an Australian resident or citizen and even then, only with a very valid reason from a very small list of exemptions. And then you have to spend two weeks in quarantine on arrival, at your own expense, with regular testing and a negative test on day 11-13 (varies from state to state). Until June, we only had rare cases of community transmission and they were all exclusively leaks from hotel quarantine (staff infected, or travellers infected from COVID positive travellers in other rooms, the latter because hotels generally have terrible ventilation, increasing the risk of infection. We need dedicated quarantine facilities [intense glare at the Federal government]). Whenever these leaks occurred, in Perth, Adelaide, Brisbane/Gold Coast, Darwin or Melbourne, these cities went into snap 3-5 hard lockdowns in response to small numbers of cases, or even single cases. This broke any chains of transmission and allowed contact tracers to exhaustively trace any and all contacts. The contact tracing here does both up- and downstream tracing, as well as 3-4 rings (primary/close contacts, their primary/close contacts, casual/secondary contacts, and sometimes casual/secondary contacts of the primary/close contacts). In my city (Perth) we had an outbreak that ended up being a cluster of six infections. We put around 3,000 contacts into home isolation for two weeks. Yes, 3,000 contacts for 6 infections. This model of snap lockdowns and contact tracing is the model that is used in Western Australia, Northern Territory, Queensland, South Australia, Victoria, the ACT and Tasmania.\r<br>\r<br><br>Secondly, the large outbreak that started in June was mostly restricted to the Greater Sydney area. It was started by a limousine driver who was transporting international flight crews; the driver wasn&#39;t vaccinated or wearing a mask and was not required to under NSW regulations. Much to the chagrin of literally every other state and territory, the New South Wales state government was a firm opponent of using snap lockdowns, or lockdowns at all. Those 300-400 cases a day are mostly limited to the Greater Sydney area. The NSW government unfortunately reacted far too slowly and in a limited way, resulting in a spreading of the Delta variant. The lockdown restrictions in Sydney have only just changed to be as strict as those used in every other state and territory. That large outbreak in Sydney has seeded outbreaks in Melbourne (x2), Brisbane (x2), Adelaide (x1), Darwin (x1), the ACT (x1) and Perth (x1). It has now also started seeding outbreaks in rural NSW.

At their math that is 0.0001% \u00d7 25 = 0.0025% ??? To me that is negligible to say the least. When the chances of some longer term problems may arise down the road from this vaxx, ya know. Like even if we get it and just cross out fingers that big pharma companies (who don&#39;t have the best track record for creating cures over customers) got it rite with little to no testing or long term observation of possible side effects, we still can contact the virus and spread it to others but now in top of that have this mystery substance in us that may or may not be  harmful long-term?. All this for something we have a  0.0025% chance of surviving anyhow? I just don&#39;t see it as worth that risk. And the high suspicion that on top of all this the government is literally considering mandating aka forcing everyone take it when the gain from doing such is soooooo small. Knowing our government really doesn&#39;t care for our individual lives, as shown through their actions, there has to be some alternative motive. Yet we can&#39;t be told what all is in this or have legitimate open conversations or questions on social media or alternative news reporting on it?

The northern beaches kinda got lucky by avoiding this mess; I guess because they learned their lesson from Christmas last year.<br>AFAIK, about 20% of the population has received their two doses (my household included). A friend who works in healthcare told me last night that the parent of a patient that came into the clinic she works in is a doctor from an inner city hospital and advised that it is at capacity with COVID patients and they have no more ICU beds or ventilators. They said they also believe that we will only get out of lockdown once we reach that 80% vaccination rate. At the rate we are going, there were about 10% fully vaccinated in June, but the rate is increasing pretty steadily, so we might reach that number sometime before the end of the year, providing enough people realise that the hoohaa about AstraZeneca was an absolutely dramatic overreaction and that the benefits greatly outweigh any risks. There are so many things that could&#39;ve been done differently, but it&#39;s too late to change anything and we can only prevent further damage by getting the jab with whatever is available; don&#39;t wait for Pfizer, or until Moderna turns up here.", "comment_date": "2021-08-15T12:40:39Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Maranedy", "comment_text": "Thank you so much for your service.", "comment_date": "2021-08-15T12:30:36Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "QPRTokyo", "comment_text": "The reason Australia was successful because it all but closed  off the country.

Prophylactic treatment would be a more fitting description. Also why does almost every lawmaker around the world treat it like there are infections prevented? They are opening venues/events only to vaccinated people. Leaving the moral issues aside, how does that make sense, when only disease severity is reduced (by an unknown degree).\r<br>How is it a surprise to scientists that a respiratory virus mutates, when that was observed in every one so far? And in every one, with every new widespread mutation infectivity increased while disease severity decreased. Evolutionary pressure forces viruses to progress in this direction as more people develop (natural) immunity, it has to become more transmissible to not disappear, and that usually comes at a cost. There is no reason to think covid behaves differently than any other respiratory disease. This reminds me of the so-called &#39;asymptomatic transmission&#39;, where to be able to do that, covid would be the first disease in all the documented history of humanity, where healthy people can spread it more than a microscopic amount.\r<br>And last: How come there are delta outbreaks/breakthroughs in almost all countries following the ramping up of the vaccination campaigns? This will fly over most peoples&#39; heads, because &#39;vaccines&#39; prevent disease, they don&#39;t cause it, by definition.

None of the variants as yet qualify to be genetically far enough removed from the wild type of SARS-CoV-2 to be considered a different strain. Not even close. The reason for this is that variants of SARS-CoV-2 can only rely on mutation to emerge, and these take a long time and many mutations to alter the genetic make enough to be a distinct strain. This is because it is a single-strand RNA virus with moderate &#39;proof reading&#39; involved during replication. Viruses which mutate quickly do not have that proof-reading capacity, such as HIV, or are what is known as a segmented-strand RNA virus, such as influenza. In a segmented virus, emergence of a new strain can happen instantly, through what is known as rearrangement. This can occur when a cell is concurrently infected with two different strains of the same virus. In the case of influenza, the RNA strand is divide into 8 segments. When dual infection of a cell occurs, replication can result in (for example) the 1st, 2nd, 4th and 8th segment from the first virus combining with the 3rd, 5th. 6th and 7th segment of the second virus, creating a new virus which is massively different to each it was derived from, which then would be a new strain. The is known as viral-rearrangement and. being a single-strand RNA virus, SARS-CoV-2 is not capable of this. While mutation alone can only cause tiny changes (probably about 0.2-0.4%) in the genetic make-up of a virus, rearrangement could see the new virus 20% or more distinct from the parent viruses. This is why new influenza strains appear continuously and why SARS-CoV-2 don&#39;t, and won&#39;t for quite some time.", "comment_date": "2021-08-15T02:43:32Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Jeffrey Chen", "comment_text": "Huh, a civilized comment section.

The majority of the infections are coming from NSW, a state, unlike the rest, is run by the conservative (and oxymoronically named) Liberal Party. Hesitancy to lock down in favour of &quot;the economy&quot; caused the outbreak to blossom. This delay was only a few days but that is precious time. Then the lockdown was seriously bungled, again with economic interests at the forefront. The lockdown were too narrow, and were disparate, with more severe measures implemented in low socioeconomic and immigrant communities, with higher caste communities enjoyed relative freedom, as well as loopholes like being able go leave locked down areas to &quot;inspect property with interest to buy&quot;. This has lead to a persistently high infection rates and outbreaks in remote communities.<br><br>The other adjacent states like QLD, VIC, and SA have had more luck with short, sharp lockdowns, with QLD managing to get a cluster of 130, starred in a school, under control in 7 days. The issue we are having now is frequent incursions coming from NSW causing more outbreaks, plunging Victoria into another lockdown less than two weeks after the last one that lasted 3 weeks.<br><br>Yes this Delta is kicking our arse, and even without the Liberal Party&#39;s total incompetence we&#39;d still be struggling; the delta variant demands stronger lockdown measures and what previously took 3 days to get under control now often takes at least 7. While the economic costs still are nowhere near outweighing the potential human cost, it is still hard and it still sucks, that cost is not zero. But rather than a complete failure of our defenses, Australia should serve as a cautionary tale of yes the strength of Delta, but also the cost of complacency, and the cost of completely bungling your vaccine rollout (courtesy of the federal Liberal government)", "comment_date": "2021-08-14T22:06:32Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "John Bai", "comment_text": "If Pfizer is effective after two shots against delta variant, then explain Israel? <br><br>They give Pfizer 35% efficacy. <br><br>Propaganda is real", "comment_date": "2021-08-14T22:05:49Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Tato Verde", "comment_text": "Oh yeah?<br>Why don&#39;t you first explain how the &quot;original&quot; strain was first identify?

This is not the typical vaccine you got as a kid for polio or measles. Those work by exposing your immune system to a dead, dormant, and or weakened version of the thing you needed to learn to fight off. And for those vaccines, once your immune system has been shown it and worked out how to stop it, your risk of ever getting that disease is slim to practically none.<br><br>Then you have your seasonal vaccines, like the flu shot. These work just like other vaccines, except that these kinds of diseases mutate and multiply fast, so even if you were vaccinated for a specific strain of the flu this year, by next year, that strain of flu will have mutated so much that your body will no longer have as effective a response against it as it did. Aside from there being many multiple strains already and not knowing which ones will be the most active that year, these kinds of vaccines are basically a booster, or rather like warmup for your immune system, prepping them for the most likely invaders for the time, so that if one is encountered, there is less of a chance for you to get sick.<br><br>This new coronavirus vaccine is an RNA vaccine. It works completely differently. This vaccine Isn&#39;t showing your immune system a &quot;version&quot; of the disease and causing you to go through a dry run for practice. Its hardcoding some of your cells with the instructions necessary to fight off the invaders if they are spotted. Instead of seeing the disease and making antibodies in response to the invaders, the cells already know how to defend and are just waiting for the signal to start doing whatever it is they now know how to do. <br><br>Because of that distinction, its entirely possible to become infected with the disease when the RNA method is used. The body, most likely, hasn&#39;t ever actually made any antibodies yet because in theory, If none of the things the new instructions say to look out for ever appear in the body, then the instructions relayed to your cells by the RNA vaccine never get used. AND it takes a little time for your body to ramp up making all those things anyway. <br><br>Since your immune system stays &#39;alert&#39; for a time after encountering an invader, The first type of vaccine rallies the troops already, in hopes of stopping the wall breach in the first place, but if the wall is breached, its still pretty bad. The RNA vaccine on the other hand has no walls at all. it hasn&#39;t rallied any specialized troops. But whenever that specific invader DOES show up, the cells already have defenses and know what to do, and get to work immediately, for a milder sickness experience overall. at least thats how i understand it.", "comment_date": "2021-08-14T06:58:58Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "YuBeace", "comment_text": "My older brother had both of his shots done and caught the delta variant!

This included not travelling more than 5km from your home, no visitors, no leaving the home unless its for getting supplies or if you&#39;re an essential worker (all of which were clearly communicated, documented and enforced with local police). Masks were also mandated indoors and outdoors. <br><br>In the current outbreak, it was in a different state (New South Wales), which has a different process on how they managed outbreaks, and it seems it was inadequate to manage the spread of the Delta variant. Instead of locking down the whole state, they initially put in light restrictions, then when things worsened, locked down local areas. This means that cases are bleeding through locked down regions into other areas, causing more spread in areas that aren&#39;t locked down. It was also a problem that during these lockdowns, there was a lot of uncertainty on what they considered reasons to leave the home. The government also didn&#39;t mandate masks, which meant (Anecdotally) about half the population didn&#39;t bother to wear them.<br><br>The current research from health experts in Australia seem to indicate that the Delta variant moves too quickly to be controlled with half measures. Hard, fast lockdowns over a wider population seems to be an effective tool to control and eliminate the Delta variant until a population is vaccinated. Unfortunately, the state government in charge of this outbreak seems unwilling to do this.<br><br>On the more political side of things, it hasn&#39;t helped that the NSW premier has been vocally critical of the lockdowns in Victoria last year, which has been supported by the right wing media. Comments calling the Victorian Premier a &quot;Dictator&quot;, for his lockdowns, seem to have created a culture of ambivalence within the NSW population. This also meant that the NSW premier has painted herself into a corner, as her voter base is now deeply resistant to lockdowns, even though they are now necessary to control the spread. This, combined with the unclear communication, has lead to the current outbreak being very different from past outbreaks. <br><br>So that&#39;s why Australia is struggling more now than before.

That&#39;s the most effective way of stopping the spread. <br>The symptoms we &#39;look for&#39; in people that might be positive and are seen as HRC(high risk contacts = people that were in contact with a positive person during their contagious period) are:<br>-cough<br>-loss of taste/smell (though indicative a very rare symptom)<br>-trouble breathing/pressure on chest<br>-runny nose<br>-soar throat<br>-headache<br>-muscle/joint pain<br>-diarrhea<br>-lack of energy (tired)<br>-nauseousness<br>-throwing up<br><br>Try to avoid contact with people and certainly those outside of your in-home family and look to get tested asap as well. better safe than sorry. If your gp isn&#39;t available try to get tested at a pharmacy, it won&#39;t be a PCR test (which is 100% the most accurate and effective as it is super sensitive) but most likely an antigen test. self tests can be good but false negatives happen so often. even positive people that do one for &#39;fun&#39; (weird I know) will sometimes call because they tested negative on it. so even if you test negative on a self test and your symptoms are still there, contact your gp.", "comment_date": "2021-08-13T21:26:16Z", "likes_count": 96}, {"comment_by": "NoNTr1v1@L", "comment_text": "Thank God the Sigma Variant hasn&#39;t spawned yet.", "comment_date": "2021-08-13T21:25:06Z", "likes_count": 10}, {"comment_by": "Timothy Bedell", "comment_text": "So j&amp;j not so much\u2026.?", "comment_date": "2021-08-13T21:25:00Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "AnastaciyaSh", "comment_text": "Could you please, PLEASE talk about Ryan Cole&#39;s report &quot;\u0441\u043evid-19 vaccines and autopsy&quot;?
