I have severe, chronic, genetic migraine though dementia has not affected my long-living family. Anyway, research seems to show that migraine attacks frequently begin with cortical spreading depression (CSD) where the brain narrows blood vessels and slows action. The excruciating pain comes when the brain sends a signal to release calcitonin gene related peptide (CGRP), which aggravates the trigeminal nerve and rapidly expands blood vessels.<br><br>Again, over-simplifying, this reminds me of the low-flow toilets that won&#39;t flush, you have to wait for the tank to refill and hope there is enough gravitational force to thoroughly clean the bowl.

I had COVID in 2020 and there is different and additional scar tissue the neurologist thinks is from COVID. He says it looks like MS but I am too old to get a full blown case of that. Alzheimer&#39;s is a possibility. COVID caused daily migraine for a while, which I eventually backed off to every 5 to 7 days. Basically, most of my time is spent building up to migraine, having a multiple day attack and then try to recover. At best I have one or two days between when I feel reasonably normal. It is known COVID causes widespread inflammation throughout the body. Considering my simplistic low-flow toilet bowl analogy, a possible scenario emerges. Or perhaps too much inflammation is in the brain so the brain partially shuts down (CSD). But the brain needs nutrients and perhaps after somewhat fasting during the CSD, the brain throws the doors open to flush out sewage and intake fuel.

Assuming amyloid plaques <b>do</b> cause Alzheimer&#39;s, that doesn&#39;t by any logic mean that removing the plaques cures the disease. Why is there even an assumption that removing the plaques will restore cognition? It seems very plausible that the plaques do damage that is simply not reversed on its own by the plagues going away. Thus, it won&#39;t get better, but that doesn&#39;t mean it will get worse, either. It <b>could</b> serve as a preventative, which would be a pretty big deal on its own.<br>2. Do we really know enough about Alzheimer&#39;s -- or the brain at all for that matter -- that cognition ever restores on its own? Or on what time frame? Just because we&#39;ve fixed brain damage, doesn&#39;t mean it fixes the person&#39;s mental state. There seems to be a lot of cases where a perfectly physical brain just doesn&#39;t function properly. Lock in syndrome, say. There&#39;s way more to the brain than just molecules. <br>3. Furthermore, it could be thar removing the plaques <b>and</b> another treatment -- perhaps some kind of memory therapy -- could be the solution, and one won&#39;t work without the other. Brains are a funny thing. I would imagine, too, that the participants in the study were significantly made up of more serious cases of Alzheimer&#39;s -- and those patients could have been affected by it so long that they became accustomed to it and won&#39;t simply snap out of it. For example, people who have had serious brain surgery sometimes have to <b>re-learn</b> to walk. It doesn&#39;t just all come back.<br>4. The fact that non-Alzheimer&#39;s patients can have abnormal plaques is a non-starter. It wouldn&#39;t be the first disease that someone can have without symptoms. By far. Again, brains hard. I&#39;m sure there&#39;s people with heart murmurs than can run marathons. Illness sources don&#39;t always work the same on everyone. If I recall, there already exists evidence that people who worked in different professions or lifestyles tend to have different likelihoods of Alzheimer&#39;s.

A lot of the already available drugs have a high potential of not working, either. My mother will receive a new medication in a month, and we are aware that there is only a 60% chance it might help. 60% was enough for me to give it a try, given that we do have another drug to fall back on if it doesn&#39;t work. <br>But I cannot really fault anybody who is willing to try lower percentages. <br><br>As said in the video, Alzmeiner&#39;s often happens in families without previous history of this disease. This is the case in my family. I have been a caregiver to my aging grandparents for years, but nobody had any form of dementia. Now I am the sole caregiver for my mom and I am a fish out of water. If I&#39;m honest with myself, then I have to admit that I&#39;m simply not used to being treated badly. Alzheimer&#39;s makes people scared and angry and sometimes they lash out on their caregiver. <br>Nobody in the extended family has any advice and I have to rely on strangers (who are trying their best but the healthcare field is struggling in a lot of countries!) to lead me step by step. <br>Had we not found a drug that at least makes life a bit easier for Mom, even though it doesn&#39;t stop the decline, then I think I&#39;d be about ready to try anything now. Life&#39;s hard every day and I have asked our doctor any question under the sun - could we get drugs from other countries if we paid for them ourselves, could we use alternative therapies, could we use stem cells or anything that I could donate, could we try XYZ thing I&#39;ve found online - but there&#39;s only a few things available that have a chance of working. I was and am very angry sometimes, that in 2022 we have no cure for a disease that affects so many people. Even in our little town there is an assisted living facility for Dementia patients. <br><br>In the end, I can only hope that research goes on and that there will be some breakthrough in the future.

The primary trauma is inflammation due to dietary sugar leading to insulin resistance leading to high blood sugar. Once your glycocalyx is knocked flat, lipoproteins and other stuff in the blood can crash into vessel walls, starting the inflammatory process of artherosclerosis. Having the fat cars (lipoproteins) crashing into the vessel walls in the brain causes trauma. This process (or other traumas) then cause further inflammation, which causes cognitive decline. The amyloid-beta and tau proteins are basically there to protect traumatized neurons, and hopefully give them a chance to heal and regrow.<br><br>I&#39;m shocked that not everyone thought this way. As far as I knew, this was the only hypothesis still standing on the primary mechanism for dementia/Alzheimer&#39;s. The lack of cognitive improvement, and sometimes cognitive regression, in people who get their proteins/plaques removed, should completely disprove the idea that these proteins are the primary mechanism for dementia.<br><br>Hasn&#39;t it been shown that tau and beta-amyloid build up in other, younger brains, like those that suffered concussions from sports, luge/skeleton or accidents?<br><br>I think it&#39;s dumb to talk about Alzheimer&#39;s, because, like so many diseases, it has really vague and/or arbitrary clinical definition.
