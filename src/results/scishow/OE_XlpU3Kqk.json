There are several versions of UT. UT0 is the unsmoothed time exactly as measured by those quasars. UT1 is UT0 with the errors introduced by the wandering of the poles smoothed out. UT1R is UT1 with effects from tides smoothed out. UT2 is UT1 with seasonal variations smoothed out. UT2R is a smoothed combination of UT1 and UT1R. UTC is an approximation of UT1 with the length of a second fixed to the length of the SI second. All the other UTs have variable length seconds. UTC is International Atomic Time (TAI, Temps Atomique International) with leap seconds added or subtracted occasionally to keep it on track with UT1. TAI doesn&#39;t track the Earth&#39;s position at all, and is just a measurement of the exact number of seconds since its inception. The reason UTC is UTC and not CUT is for two reasons: the French didn&#39;t want the abbreviation based on English, and the English didn&#39;t want the abbreviation based on French, and they both wanted the abbreviation to be the same in all languages; and to make it match the previous Universal Time abbreviation convention of UT??.", "comment_date": "2021-04-06T01:06:31Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Mal", "comment_text": "Whipping 1.46 milliseconds XD<br>Not saying it doesnt matter, but saying it out loud does sound a little silly", "comment_date": "2021-04-06T01:04:49Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Herbert Fawcett", "comment_text": "POLITICS.
