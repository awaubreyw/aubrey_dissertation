One of the big problems is that tornado&#39;s and water spouts don&#39;t suck things up; that&#39;s a misconception. The wind lifts things off the ground and chucks them, but something underwater should be completely unaffected by a waterspout since the effects of the waterspout don&#39;t penetrate the surface. The waterspout explanation is popular but makes way less sense than a much simpler explanation. <br><br>Some aquatic animals can survive on land for some time and will migrate from one body of water to another. They tend to do this when it&#39;s wet, as, being aquatic, they don&#39;t want to dry out. Skeptoid podcast maker Brian Dunning did extensive research on this and and found not only no reliable evidence of animals being sucked up, but no evidence of animals actually falling from the sky, nor any reliable reports of them being in places other than the ground. He suggests the possibility that people would see aquatic animals on land after a heavy rain and assume that they must have fallen out of the sky, because how else do a bunch of fish end up in the middle of a road? This also explains why they&#39;re all the same species as well, as they&#39;re the only ones likely to be migrating en-mass at that particular point at time. Brian Dunning found in his research that the species of fish that were reported to have fallen from the sky are always ones that can survive on land for a longer period of time than normal, like certain species of catfish or mudskippers.<br><br>I noticed that the references listed referencing the phenomenon (not just waterspouts) are all from the mainstream media, which is notoriously poor at doing accurate science reporting.
