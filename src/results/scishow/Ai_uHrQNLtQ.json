Thus coffee grown on the western slopes of Mexico are significantly better than those grown on the eastern slopes. <br>     The Americas are known for growing arabica coffee, exclusively at the time when I sat at the tasting table. Whether it is the same today I cannot say. Arabica coffees are sold in two forms- processed and unprocessed. The process is called fermentation but has nothing to do with alcohol. It is a natural process. All the best coffees are processed. Of all the &quot;fermented&quot; coffees, Kenyan and Colombian are clearly superior. Of the others, Costa Rican is most consistently the best. Hawaiian and Jamaican Blue Mountain are generally equivalent to the Central American coffees, but the Centrals are a whole lot cheaper.<br>     Coffee tasting is different from wine tasting and has a mostly different set of terms.

Since I was kid I have noticed a strange phenomenon with a ceramic mug  filled with freshly made hot chocolate (the kind made from mixing powder with hot water).  If you stir the mixture up and then tap the mug repeatedly with a spoon after the hot water is added , you will often hear the pitch of the sound rise higher and higher over the space of about half a minute, at which time it stops changing. At first I thought that this was because the mug was heating up and this somehow affected its natural frequency  or speed of sound transmission. But, if that were the case, the same would presumably happen with any hot liquid added to the mug - coffee, tea , hot water etc. Yet none of these other liquids seem to to produce the same effect, only hot chocolate.
