The insignificant amount, even over the milleniums, can&#39;t make THAT much of a difference (Plus, given that it is widely accepted that much of what is now part of the western mountainous edge of Canada use to be a series of Islands on the Pacific plate, those land masses probably compasate for what was lost and creates a barrier for &quot;river material&quot; to reach the ocean; this would not apply everywhere, of course, but other processes elsewhere are probably often present).<br><br>The overall picture of the presentation seems to be quite lacking in scope!", "comment_date": "2021-01-26T13:43:11Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Ahtraihue B.", "comment_text": "Water is a human right, Boycott Nestle &amp; any water bottle brands!<br> Water is as important as Air, it is not a commodity. <br>   Stand for something or fall for anything!
