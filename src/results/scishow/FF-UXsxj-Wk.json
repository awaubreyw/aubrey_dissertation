I&#39;ve been testing my blood glucose 8 or more times a day via finger stick monitoring for more forty years and I can assure you that current meters are often off by as much as 30+ %. For those foolish enough to think that keeping their blood sugar between 80 and 250 mg/dl is okay a 30% +/- error may not seem like a big deal. But for those attempting to keep their blood sugar in a healthy range of say 80 to 110 mg/dl a 30% error can cause serious mistakes in insulin dosage, particularly when taking extra postprandial (after meal) insulin to correct high blood glucose. As far as current Continuous Glucose Monitoring systems, they are both very expensive to use and sorely lacking in accuracy. Worse yet they depend upon admittedly inaccurate finger stick meters as a check on accuracy. As I recently wrote in a piece on CGM systems using an inaccurate finger stick meter to evaluate the accuracy of an even more imprecise measuring device like a CGM system is a bit like using the odometer in your neighbor&#39;s car to measure the distance between Boston and San Francisco to check the distance recorded by the odometer in your own car.
