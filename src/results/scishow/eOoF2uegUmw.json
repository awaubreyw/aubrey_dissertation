An example of this is with the monster hunter series if you use visual cues for your actions with some monsters or mini games you will never be able to react quickly enough to avoid certain attacks or activate the event at the correct time but if you use your ears and the vibration of controllers you can easily avoid the attack or activate the event. This is mostly just personal experience but everyone who uses the cues I just mentioned to take an action will be successful and those who use only visual cues are not.

The eating area was near a large wooded area. Crow, maybe ravens would come out, and watch us eat. We would put our left over food out for the crows, but they never touched that. I don&#39;t they trusted us. Thing is, they would take food out of the trash, and eat that. On guy was eating bread cheese stick out of paper box. He had four left. He put them in the box, and threw them out.  The crow flew right down, and popped the box open. He took out the four bread sticks, and and a paper napkin. He stacked the cheese stick, so he could grab them all, but there was to many. Then sea gulls started show up. That&#39;s when the crow ripped out chunks of paper towl, and threw them. The wind took the bits of paper towl, and sea gulls chased them. The crow kept biting off the ends of the cheese sticks. Why I don&#39;t know, but after the seaguls realized the bit of paper wasn&#39;t food, they came back. The crow ripped another chunk of paper towl, and let the wind talk it. The crow finally ate one cheese stick, and reduce the size of the other. It let go of the paper towl, and seaguls chased that, as the crow flew away.", "comment_date": "2021-10-27T12:05:04Z", "likes_count": 13}, {"comment_by": "Ivan Dmitriev", "comment_text": "Confuse-a-cat service?", "comment_date": "2021-10-27T11:49:06Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Jonathan Desautels", "comment_text": "I fool my dog with magic when I pretend to throw her a stick.

You don&#39;t really want to know. You want to be fooled. But you wouldn&#39;t clap yet. Because making something disappear isn&#39;t enough; you have to bring it back.
