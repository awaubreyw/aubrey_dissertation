The acidificiation or the decrease in ph in the oceans is partially caused by global climate change, but it&#39;s also caused by the increase of nitrates and nitrites from agriculture. On top of that over fishing and climate issues also create mass growth of competitive and predatory inverts and algae. Corals for the most part are on their way out, along with most of the ocean&#39;s species. The ecological collapse of the earth&#39;s oceans is one of the biggest global disasters we face that will coincide and partially be caused by global climate change.<br><br><br>Fun fact though, throughout the Phanerazoic (the current eon we are in, IE the past 500+ million years in earth biological history), most reefs in the fossil record were not built by corals. The earliest known reefs were built by planktonic microscopic organisms, sponges, algae and even a few built by clams in the Mesozoic, were the primary reef builders. While corals have existed since the Cambrian, most were solitary species, a bit different than the colonial corals we are more familiar with in a reef setting (although solitary corals still exist). Coral reefs didn&#39;t start to become a major ecological system, until roughly 20-30 million years ago.  <br><br><br>The one bit of good news is that corals have had a long history of depletion and reemergence.

She told me this in the mid-1970\u2019s, and I always just assumed it to be true, the way kids often take their parents\u2019 word on blind faith, and I had no idea that she just sort of made it up.
