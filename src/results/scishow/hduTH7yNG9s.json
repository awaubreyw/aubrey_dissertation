I will not humor them, I will not even allow myself to get along with them, no matter how they act. Allow me to tell a story to explain why.<br><br>It was 2010, during the H1N1 Swine Flu pandemic, I was in 5th grade, and I had not yet gotten my yearly flu vaccine. My parents didn\u2019t oppose it at all to be clear, I have amazing parents, we just hadn\u2019t gotten around to it. But all my friends had gotten it, and had spent a lot of time around me, yet they never got sick. It was a normal Friday, I felt great, and I went about my day like nothing was wrong. We had a pizza party for lunch. I was in line to get my pizza and had just grabbed a slice. Then, with no warning, no nausea, no nothing, I suddenly began vomiting onto the floor. Naturally I was sent home for the day. Luckily it was Friday so I\u2019d have the weekend to recover and I\u2019d be back to school on Monday. <br><br>That was the idea at least, but instead my condition began to get progressively worse. I spent the entire weekend on an air mattress in my parents bedroom so they could keep an eye on me, I could barely stand up, and the entire weekend was nothing but the most horrific, unrelenting nausea I\u2019d ever felt. My temperature reached 107 F. By Monday morning it was clear that I was not recovering. And my mom took me to the doctor. The doctor took one look at me and immediately decided that not only did I need to go to the hospital, she insisted I be taken by ambulance. So I was. I was put on a stretcher and sent off. I spent 5 days there, and felt like death the entire time. I had developed severe pneumonia in my lungs. And I felt so horrible that I remember I had to be taken to the X-ray room by wheelchair, and standing up for the X-ray was so painful I was crying. Two nurses had to hold me up by my arms over their shoulders in order for me to be able to stand. My blood oxygen concentration was extremely low. According to my doctors, the readers they used to measure it would rate a healthy person at 95-100, and anything below 90 was considered low. Even with an oxygen mask, I frequently dipped into the 70s and even the high 60s a couple times. I slowly recovered, and after 5 days was finally sent home, I was still weak and needed antibiotics for the pneumonia, so that kept me home, all in all I missed nearly a month of school. And at the time I had no idea just how bad my situation was, or how close I might have been to dying. And I would have, if not for modern medicine. Those doctors saved my life, they saved me from a flu strain that not even 100 years earlier at that time, had killed 50-100 million people.<br><br>I had not gotten my vaccine yet, and the doctors who saved my life told me that the vaccine would have prevented it. I trust them more than some paranoid parents spewing crap on the internet. This happened because I wasn\u2019t vaccinated. And the idea that some children could be subjected to what I experienced, all because their self righteous parents think they know better than the ones who saved my life, pisses me off more than nearly anything else on this planet.<br><br>I am not like a lot of people, I have a very optimistic view of humanity, I do my best to break the negativity bias and show all the good we do as a species, and that we are better than we give ourselves credit for...

When measles struck, my parents kept rooms darkened to protect our eyes from the sun, calamine lotion to ease the itching, and cool baths or cold compresses and baby aspirin (called low dose now) to control rising fevers.  It was not uncommon for body temperatures to rise past 103 to 105 degrees or more, causing the sickest children to have seizures and brain damage.<br><br>The DTP (diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis) vaccine was available.  I remember when the polio vaccine became widely available in the early 1960\u2019s.  Too many families had lost members or had become crippled from being infected during outbreaks in the prior dozen years.  It was such a public health concern that mass immunizations took place, with whole families lining up in the city\u2019s school gyms and community centers to be vaccinated.  BTW, prior to the introduction of the measles vaccination, there was an average of 483 people who died EVERY year from measles - in the USA!  Through widespread vaccination and herd immunity, measles had been eliminated from the USA sometime after 2002.
