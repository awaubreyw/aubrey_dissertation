But it tells you that you&#39;re dying because the ego very strongly identifies with the equilibrium of the physical body and as the physical body begins to slide into the intoxication the ego is saying, what&#39;s happening here? Wait a minute! I&#39;m loosing coherency, this is not good! You made a mistake Joe! We need help Joe! It&#39;s coming apart! In that moment you have to say chill out Ego! It&#39;s going to be alright! And so you have to discipline yourself that way. The dissolving of the ego, that is dissolving of this maladaptive behaviour pattern that has made our sexual and social politics so complicated. In other words the ego is not a good thing, it&#39;s existence in each one of us is in extremely expressed form a symptom of neurosis, a cultural neurosis. And psychedelic dissolves the ego but the ego protests noisily while this is going on. And people who are very ego dependent, if they have a psychedelic experience they usually have one and then they say, well that was like going nuts, I hated it, it was awful. It&#39;s because they are very strongly identified with the ego. And another person who isn&#39;t so strongly identified with the ego could look at the identical experience and say it was a wonderful liberation, it was quintessence of freedom and light and openness.
