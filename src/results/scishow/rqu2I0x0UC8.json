The problem comes when People are being People and won&#39;t wear the mask in public. Like those Morons in the Wisconsin Bars. However,I don&#39;t see any reason to wear one at home, especially if you don&#39;t have any symptoms. I understand that some stores are finally getting hand sanitizer which is great. And you need to keep washing your hands. But, wearing the proper mask in public will do more to stop the spread of any virus then anything we have come up with so far. As far as everyone saying that only medical people should get them because they are so hard to get in the first place, Find the jerks who bought them all to up sell them online and take them.

If you are going to wear a mask you should make sure it is an occlusive mask (i.e. no air movement forward through the mask like real surgical/medical masks). Cloth masks allow a significant amount of air flow through them and the reason this is important is because the protection provided in normal face-to-face interaction is basically lost (which is clearly the most important transmission event for airborne infections). By having an occlusive mask in uncrowded places your breath is spread out to the sides of your face, respiratory droplets are blocked/collide with the mask and the virus has the opportunity to effectively be diluted by the much larger volume of air around you.

Si tenemos un episodio m\u00e1s reciente sobre COVID-19, lo incluiremos en la descripci\u00f3n.\r<br>\r<br>El 3 de abril en EUA, los centros para el control y prevenci\u00f3n de enfermedades (CDC) empezaron a recomendar que la gente utilice cubrebocas cuando est\u00e9n en p\u00fablico. Estos lineamientos no reemplazan al distanciamiento social. A\u00fan es sumamente importante mantenerse alejado de otras personas lo m\u00e1s que sea posible. Lo cual estoy haciendo al filmar este episodio desde mi casa.\r<br>\r<br>Pero los cubrebocas est\u00e1n dise\u00f1ados para evitar que el virus se propague en lugares m\u00e1s concurridos a los cuales a\u00fan necesitamos ir, como tiendas de abarrotes. \r<br>\r<br>Salvo que para muchos de nosotros, este no fue el mensaje que inicialmente recibimos durante los dos \u00faltimos meses. Antes de esta recomendaci\u00f3n, muchas organizaciones de la salud recomendaban no usar cubrebocas, a menos que estuvieras enfermo o cuidando de alguien que estuviera enfermo. \r<br>\r<br>Entonces. \u00bfQu\u00e9 cambi\u00f3? \r<br>\r<br>Bueno, no es que los cient\u00edficos aprendieran algo nuevo respecto a los cubrebocas. Sino que descubrieron m\u00e1s cosas respecto a c\u00f3mo se propaga el virus. \r<br>\r<br>En la mayor\u00eda de los caos, el cubrebocas no va a evitar que te enfermes, si hay virus flotando en el aire alrededor de ti. Hemos hablado de esto antes, pero cuando respiras utilizando un cubrebocas b\u00e1sico, mucho del aire que entra, proviene de las orillas de la mascarilla, y como el aire no pasa a trav\u00e9s del cubrebocas sino en las brechas que quedan en las orillas, el virus logra pasar.\r<br>\r<br>Los respiradores (como las N95) son m\u00e1s sofisticados y ofrecen mejor protecci\u00f3n siempre que est\u00e9n debidamente ajustados y se utilicen correctamente. Pero, y estoy seguro que has escuchado \u00e9sto, que esos deben reservarse por los trabajadores del sector salud, que est\u00e1n trabajando cercana y personalmente con pacientes de COVID19 constantemente. \r<br>\r<br>Sin embargo, a pesar de que los cubrebocas b\u00e1sicos no pueden realmente evitar que los virus entren, son mucho m\u00e1s efectivos evitando que salgan. \r<br>\r<br>Ver\u00e1s, cuando toses, estornudas, o incluso al hablar, no s\u00f3lo exhalas aire, sino tambi\u00e9n peque\u00f1as part\u00edculas de humedad que los cient\u00edficos llaman &quot;gotillas respiratorias&quot;, y si est\u00e1s enfermo esas gotillas pueden estar saturadas de virus. Pero un cubrebocas, retiene muchas de esas gotillas.\r<br>\r<br>Es por eso que la CDC y la OMS, han recomendado por meses que cualquiera que est\u00e9 tosiendo, estornudando o enfermo, utilice cubrebocas.\r<br>\r<br>Pero ahora las cosas est\u00e1n cambiando, al menos para la CDC.  Y esto es porque nueva investigaci\u00f3n sugiere que no s\u00f3lo la gente que sabe que est\u00e1 enferma, puede infectar a otros. Sabemos que algunos casos de COVID19 pueden ser muy leves. Y mientras que la mayor parte de la gente con un caso leve presenta fiebre, es posible que ni siquiera sepan que est\u00e1n enfermos. Pero m\u00e1s all\u00e1 de eso, parece ser que hay casos donde gente con el virus, nunca muestran s\u00edntomas, pero a\u00fan as\u00ed pueden transmitirlo. Y para el resto, la evidencia se sigue acumulando en el sentido de que es posible transmitir el virus cuando est\u00e1s presintom\u00e1tico, es decir, antes de empezar a presentar s\u00edntomas. \r<br>\r<br>Por ejemplo, un estudio publicado el primero de Abril, encontr\u00f3 que alrededor del 6% de los casos en Singapur parecen estar ligados a UNA persona que estaba presintom\u00e1tica. Y en China, casos fuera del epicentro de la provincia de Hubei, el porcentaje fue m\u00e1s cercano a 13%.  Por definici\u00f3n, las personas Presint\u00f3m\u00e1ticas no est\u00e1n tosiendo,  o estornudando, y puede que no lo hagan por d\u00edas, pero a\u00fan actividades normales como hablar, o algunas que no puedes evitar, como respirar, pueden crear gotillas respiratorias. Y mientras que a\u00fan no  se sabe si estas part\u00edculas son lo suficientemente grandes como para transmitir el virus, algunos cient\u00edficos, y algunos estudios preliminares sugieren que efectivamente es una posibilidad.\r<br>\r<br>En cualquier caso, la transmisi\u00f3n asintom\u00e1tica y presint\u00f3matica parece estar ocurriendo. Y es por eso que las recomendaciones oficiacies en EUA y en todas partes del mundo est\u00e1n cambiando para recomendar que TODOS usemos cubrebocas. Porque es posible que alguien transmita el COVI19 sin siquiera saber que est\u00e1 enfermo/a. Por lo que usando cubrebocas, estamos ayudando a proteger a los dem\u00e1s. \r<br>\r<br>En respuesta a esto, probablemente has visto gente haciendo sus propias mascarillas/cubrebocas utilizando retazos de tela o paliacates. Y aunque \u00e9sto puedea parecer una medida de cuidado trivial, la limitada evidencia con que contamos sugiere que s\u00ed es \u00fatil.\r<br>\r<br>Por ejemplo, un estudio realizado en 2013. Que como fue hecho hace siete a\u00f1os, no es referente al COVID19, sino otros virus. El estudio encontr\u00f3 que una camiseta de algod\u00f3n bloqueaba alrededor de la mitad de los virus al toser, mientras que un trapo de cocina (&quot;tea towel&quot;, costura m\u00e1s cerrada), detuvo el 72%.\r<br>\r<br>Por supuesto, en este punto hay mucho que a\u00fan no sabemos, sobre este coronavirus, y no hay muchos estudios respecto a cubrebocas caseros.  Es por eso que algunos expertos no coinciden con la recomendaci\u00f3n de la CDC. Pero otros investigadores argumentan que hacer algo, es mejor que no hacer nada.\r<br>\r<br>Si te interesa hacer tu propio cubrebocas, el sitio web de la CDC tiene varios patrones, incluyendo algunos que no requieren de costura, e incluiremos un link a \u00e9sto en la descripci\u00f3n del video. (<a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/prevent-getting-sick/diy-cloth-face-coverings.html)\">https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/prevent-getting-sick/diy-cloth-face-coverings.html)\r</a><br>\r<br>Pero hay algo importante que debemos saber. A pesar de que utilizar un cubrebocas nos puede dar un sentido de seguridad, para que funcionen, debes usarlos correctamente. Aqu\u00ed tengo un cubrebocas y por lo tanto puedo demostrar c\u00f3mo se usa. Debes usarlo apretado sobre tu nariz y boca, y debes evitar tocar los lados y las correas (el\u00e1sticos) lo m\u00e1s posible, no debes y no debes tocar el frente de la mascarilla en lo absoluto. Puede sonar tonto, pero b\u00e1sicamente debes de tratar el cubrebocas como si estuviera cubierto en pollo crudo o pop\u00f3. \r<br>\r<br> Cuando sea momento de retirarte el cubrebocas, hazlo utilizando los resortes o cintas. Luego, despu\u00e9s de cada uso, almacena tu cubrebocas en una bolsa hasta que puedas lavarlo con agua caliente y jab\u00f3n. Y por supuesto, l\u00e1vate las manos ANTES y DESPU\u00c9S de tocar el cubrebocas. \r<br>\r<br>Conforme nuestro entendimiento respecto al COVID19 siga mejorando, existe una alta probabilidad de que las recomendaciones vuelvan a cambiar. \r<br>\r<br>Pero mira, eso, honestamente es algo bueno. Las recomendaciones cambian cuando entendemos m\u00e1s respecto a este virus y esta enfermedad. Y esto es algo que contin\u00faa sucediendo. Al final del d\u00eda, esta va a ser informaci\u00f3n que nos ayude a mantenernos seguros los unos a los otros, y a descubrir c\u00f3mo es que vamos a salir de esta situaci\u00f3n. \r<br>\r<br>Gracias por ver este episodio de SciShow. Esperamos que se est\u00e9n manteniendo a salvo y bien.

All the information you\u2019re quoting here as the reason why there\u2019s been a shift now has been known for YEARS. Maybe not specific to Covid19, but completely applicable to other similar viruses and illnesses. It\u2019s not unscientific to make assumptions in this scenario that if a face mask, even a non medical one (like something made of cloth, cotton fabric, etc) might help prevent a higher viral load being aspirated by a person might equally prevent a higher viral load from leaving a sick person\u2019s body and reaching others. This is common knowledge and socially accepted in asian countries. The sad fact seems to be that western countries knew they didn\u2019t have enough supplies for healthcare workers and purposely misinformed the public to reduce chances of stockpiling and panic buying to secure whatever we did have for healthcare workers. They have done us all a disservice. Their lack of foresight and preparation has contributed to the spread of the disease. We should\u2019ve been requesting higher production of face masks since January, and educating the public on how to wear them and dispose of them correctly. We should\u2019ve been honest. These errors and the misinformation of the public only generates mistrust, making some people more willing to believe weird conspiracy theories, making us all more vulnerable (\u201cif the gov lied about the masks, what else arent they lying about?!\u201d). This has been one of the most costly mistakes we have made in regards to Covid19. Someday in the future we will probably have the data to back this up completely.

If I&#39;m supposed to assume I&#39;m infected all the time, and infected people should wear masks, then I should wear one all the time even if asymptomatic, and if I should wear one while caring for someone infected, then clearly they must impart some protection to the wearer.       <br>The real reason they were telling people &quot;don&#39;t wear masks&quot;  and &quot;wearing a mask may be worse than not wearing one&quot;  (seriously they said that), was because they were worried about the public buying <b>all</b> available masks leaving none for healthcare workers, which is a valid concern.

Wearing them when you are out walking and keeping a reasonable distance from others is not. Breathing and constantly recycling oxygen is.necessary to keep your lungs clear and if you have early stages of virus or any other similar illness for that matter a mask will hinder this process and could actually assist the virus to grow more virulent since you are containing the spores and not reoxygenating.and probably making it more virulent. And if have a severe case of cv you shouldn\u2019t be out at all because that mask will only help the virus reproduce in your lower respiratory track and cause pneumonia. And as pointed out, the mask will not prevent you from getting sick but people can get a false sense of security, and also pointed out here is that is you do not don and doff mask properly you haven\u2019t done anything to truly protect yourself.

Public health  officials will, by the very act of deception erode trust. In a democracy we need trust in times of crisis to achieve broadly; a sense of national unity.
