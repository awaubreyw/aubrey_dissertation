Ice i get, it has almost zero friction and is sometimes hard to see, and can form seemingly randomly. However, based on much experience with snowy roads, the most effective method is an extensive plowing, removing the majority of the snow from the road, as large clumps formed by traffic can severely redirect the course of any vehicle that encounters one. Salted roads however, are the worst of both worlds. Until the snow is melted or plowed away, the tracks still do form- and turn the snow into slush. This slush has about the same grip as snow, but is far more dense, but the lack of grip is due to the weight of the slush, so snow tires have almost no positive effect on affected roads. The same effect of the snow clumps forms but much more apparent, often in salted roads with regular traffic the same tracks will form, but instead on the outsides and in the middle of the road will be giant lines of  heavy slush, and if you hit one of these your front tires will be lifted above the ground due to the high density of the substance and sometimes hydroplaning forces, and if your wheels are turned at all the vehicle will likely veer in an unpredictable direction, while still having no grip. These are by far the most common crashes on poor condition roads and definitely the most damaging. All crashes on snowy roads can be prevented with proper tires, knowledge of vehicle handling, and driving within the limits of grip. Not only is salt damaging to vehicles and the environment, it is also more dangerous for drivers.", "comment_date": "2018-11-28T00:05:39Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Davis Clark", "comment_text": "In Wyoming, we use this Chemical that we spray on the roads and during a storm the snow doesn\u2019t stick to the road.
