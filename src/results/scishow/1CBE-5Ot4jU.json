This video is poorly researched to say the least.   I agree there is nothing proven about ALKALINE water.  Alkaline water sold in bottles that are sold are full of sodium bicarbonate and other balancers making it appear to be alkaline when tested with drops.  DO NOT DRINK THIS!  There is a general confusion in alkaline water and IONIZED ERW water.  Ionized water is rich in hydrogen and an electrical charge.  Hydrogen scavenges the body for OH (hydroxyl radicals) and attaches the extra hydrogen to it creating a water molecule in place of a very dangerous &#39;natural&#39; OH.  OH is like a tiny computer virus that reprograms healthy cells to multiply instead of self destruct in times of mutation.  Let&#39;s talk mutation..... that is largely caused by free radicals that are missing their negative electrical charge. When you drink water that is electrically charged, it is a scavenger for free radicals balancing them with their own negative charge so they stop picking fights with other cells.  There are considerable studies being done on this topic; every year there are more and more.  If you would like to do some actual research on the topic, please look for studies on ionized water, ERW (electrolysis reduced water) or hydrogen water.  Lastly I will mention that PH stands for the probability of hydrogen.  You can only affect the true PH of water with an ionizer.   Reach out to me if you have any questions on facebook or youtube.

I\u2019ve not even known loons to claim this.The body can compensate for acid intake in various ways, but they come at a cost of resources and energy to your body. Alkaline water just frees up those resources. The water has had different effects depending on the person. Most have found your bladder works better so you pee less frequently. In Korea, they first noticed feces stopped having an odor (also true in my experience). It cured a severe case of arthritis in my mother in a few months.

Its purpose is in alignment with the purpose of an overall  alkaline diet. The purpose of an alkaline diet is not to change the pH of your blood. It does not aim to change the pH of organs, tissues, or cells. The purpose is to provide the body the alkaline resources which help the body regulate the delicate pH balance of every organ and system in the body.  Think of acid forming foods as being hot, whereas alkaline forming foods cool down the body.  Alkaline food and water help put out fires created by too much acid forming food, which dry us out and burn up our organs.  It&#39;s about balance. <br><br><br><br>The requirements of maintaining the blood pH at 7.35 are such that when the alkaline resources are not available through the diet, the body must maintain that blood pH at any cost. That cost of inadequate alkalinity in the diet is huge. Bone and muscle are prime suppliers of alkaline material which help maintain blood pH. Bone supplies calcium and muscle supply magnesium to help buffer the blood when the diet is deficient. All the organs suffer the effects of this buffering requirement. <br><br><br><br>The 4 day study of the alkaline diet referenced in the presentation is a joke on many levels. First, the study was set up to find evidence that an alkaline diet could alter the pH of blood. Blood pH is maintained at a perfect 7.35 pH, and nobody wants to mess with that.  Second,  the alkaline diet group did not actually get foods which are alkaline forming. The researchers that concocted this experiment did not have a complete understanding of the acid or alkaline forming properties of the different foods, and simply proceeded with the mineral ash scores as determinants of how food was categorized. For example, the alkaline group were fed cheese, which has a net acid forming effect in the body, in spite of the calcium content.  In effect, both groups in that study received an acid forming diet. Alkaline forming foods primarily come from fruits, vegetables, nuts, and seeds.  No study can meaningfully assess health benefits of any diet in a meaningful manner in 4 days. This study has no has no purpose other than to perpetuate ignorance. <br><br><br><br>The kidneys do help to maintain blood pH. They do this through various mechanisms including production of bicarbonate, which buffers the blood, and through chelation of acids to minerals for excretion through the urine. Kidneys will eventually fail under an excessive acid load if alkaline resources are not adequately supplied through the diet, which is the case with the Standard American Diet, which is very acid forming. Such a diet will eventually burn the kidney tubules if not corrected through a more alkaline forming regimen.<br><br><br>Stomach pH is maintained through various mechanisms. For example, the pancreas secretes bicarbonate into the stomach which improves digestion and signals hydrochloric acid production.  An alkaline diet promotes correct stomach pH both directly and indirectly, which in turn corrects indigestion and acid reflux. This protects the stomach, pancreas, kidneys, and effortlessly allows the body to maintain blood pH at 7.35. <br><br><br><br>There are many types of cancer. It&#39;s true that not all cancers can be corrected solely through an adjustment of the pH, but evidence is mounting suggesting that most are. Have a look at the work of Dr. Tulio Simoncini, an oncologist who has a high success rate of treating cancer with bicarbonate. He treats cancer with sodium bicarbonate, through various protocols including direct injection, bicarbonate IV, and oral dosing. <br><br><br><br>Another useful analogy is to think of every cell in your body as a fish in a fish bowl. That water needs to be clean, with a balanced pH for that fish to be healthy. The fish&#39;s waste products move into that water. If that water gets cloudy (acid) the fish&#39;s health will begin to decline. Our current medical paradigm would have us study the fish under a microscope, analyze various biochemical markers, and then address those through medical interventions (medication, surgery). The fish is then tossed back into the dirty water, where it will continue to function briefly until symptoms reappear. Like the fish in the bowl, every cell in our body is swimming in an interstitial fluid which must maintain a balanced pH. The cells receive their nutrients through that fluid, and release their waste into it. Applying an alkaline diet helps keep that water at a healthy pH for all our cells..", "comment_date": "2019-07-23T21:31:30Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "subu mahanta", "comment_text": "This video totally misleading.

While I&#39;m not a supporter of alkaline water as a cure all, there&#39;s medical research to support that people with alkaline urine have a strong correlated with good health. Whole food plant based diets are the easiest way to improve urine pH. The pH of our sinus fluid ranged significantly based on diet as well, which can decrease cold/allergy symptoms. There&#39;s even research into joint fluid pH and arthritis, which may or may not be related to diet. Look, I flushed a dozen polyps one week after adopting an alkaline diet including some alkaline water. Not because my poo was alkaline, a healthy colon is actually an acidic colon. An alkaline diet, which is basically a whole food plant based diet, will increase urine pH and decrease colon pH. I also went 5 years without a cold, after almost having to undergo sinus surgery. So, hate on alkaline water all you want. The water itself is not backed by any science and it definitely isn&#39;t helpful when you&#39;re already eating well, but do some actual research on a medical journals before regergitating the &quot;blood pH doesn&#39;t change&quot; line from other under-researched blog posts.

See, water in itself can\u2019t be alkaline, as pure distilled water is always pH 7 at room temperature. So to make water more alkaline, we add alkaline chemicals to it that are safe for consumption. These chemicals often if not always include the salts (ionic compounds) of magnesium, sodium and potassium. These chemicals raise the pH of water, as pH means the amount of H+ ions there are in water and as you know, salts break down into ions when dissolved in water. So when we add these salts into the water, we increase the amount of OH- ions in water by adding these Na+, K+ etc. ions with the salts that separate from their negative ion pairs that bond with the more reactive free H+ ions (the stuff that makes things acidic) and therefore increase the pH. So the end result is that by adding different salts to the water, we ingest important minerals even though the more alkaline pH has virtually no effect on our bodies.<br><br><br>TL;DR: Alkaline water is good but not because it\u2019s alkaline.", "comment_date": "2019-03-11T21:34:05Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Jonathan", "comment_text": "So you&#39;re saying these people r stupid correct ?", "comment_date": "2019-03-11T21:32:58Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Cracked Emerald", "comment_text": "Water <i>should</i> be at a pH of 7, but, bottled water is generally lower", "comment_date": "2019-03-11T21:32:08Z", "likes_count": 2}, {"comment_by": "Tim S", "comment_text": "I drink snake venom", "comment_date": "2019-03-11T21:31:35Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "eric jones", "comment_text": "It&#39;s a gimmick to get you to drink their water.", "comment_date": "2019-03-11T21:31:31Z", "likes_count": 55}, {"comment_by": "Floyd Harrison", "comment_text": "Case studies arent effective at disproving anything.", "comment_date": "2019-03-11T21:30:20Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Alen Asenie", "comment_text": "I dont think is better for health, but is more tasty for me, so, for me, the value is higher than regular water", "comment_date": "2019-03-11T21:28:40Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Rien", "comment_text": "smh stick to cucumber water while doing mewing-yoga", "comment_date": "2019-03-11T21:26:44Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "SoberRS", "comment_text": "alkaline water also dosent contain floride.", "comment_date": "2019-03-11T21:26:06Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Chris H", "comment_text": "Most FL tap water is alkaline and in the same range as the marketed stuff.
