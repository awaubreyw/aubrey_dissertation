This was important in being able to assert that Albert&#39;s upset around the white furry animal was not spontaneous.  Yes, he was the son of a cleaning lady at the institution, so there are concerns about the power dynamic, but they asked her permission.  And if I recall correctly, efforts were made sometime later to extinguish the association.  Albert did not go on to be a homeless drug addict or axe murderer (or rabid anti-vaxxer).<br><br>In his book, Milgram describes a series of studies that are generally not discussed in Intro Psych classes and textbooks, and often not known about even by social psych profs.  The one study many of us have seen illustrated in the &quot;Obedience to Authority&quot; movie is the most extreme of his studies, and illustrated our willingness to do harm to those we cannot see (kind of a microcosm of what transpires daily on the internet, isn&#39;t it?).  As far as the &quot;teacher&quot; knew, the &quot;learner&quot; had agreed to the study, and they believed there was a 50/50 chance that either name could be drawn from the hat, when it came time for the experimenter to assign teacher or learner roles; so as far as they knew, the learner was as willing to take the gamble as they were, making it fair in their own mind.  The studies Milgram details in his book involved situations where the teacher <b>could</b> see the learner, either across the room, or even beside them.  The closer the learner was to the teacher, the less likely the teacher/subject was to administer the shocks as per their instructions.  The more people can SEE/witness the consequences of their harmful actions, the more mindful they are of that harm, and the more conscientious they become.<br><br>One of the most pivotal studies in the history of psychology, that you didn&#39;t mention, was Schacter and Singer&#39;s 1961 paper on how we experience and label emotions.  Undergrads were brought in under the premise that they would be trying out a vitamin that improved vision.  Unbeknownst to them, they were injected with epinephrine/adrenaline.  They were told it would take a little while for the &quot;vitamin&quot; to work, and that during the waiting period there were some simple math and other paper-and-pencil tasks to fill up the time.  Half of them were told in advance what effects to expect of the &quot;vitamin&quot; while the other half received no advance info.  During the waiting period, an accomplice of the investigator, portraying a fellow volunteer also waiting for the vitamin to work, either acted irritated or in a goofy silly manner.  The actual participants were eventually asked to describe their mood.  Those who had an explanation for what they were feeling described little change in mood.  Those with no explanation, and in the company of a silly partner, reported feeling happier and more &quot;up&quot;, while those in the company of an irritated partner reported a more negative mood.  The upshot and insight was that the very same physical sensations can be labelled and experienced differently, depending on context.  In other words, there is not much that is inherently <b>unique</b> to any given emotion.  The sensations are certainly real, but the subjective experience depends on the labelling.  That study could not be done today, because it  requires deceiving the participants.  But I&#39;m glad it was done.<br><br>I&#39;m happy that ethical standards have become more stringent over time.  Any research I&#39;ve been involved with that did not involve animals adhered to the Belmont report.

I&#39;m in my 30&#39;s and I&#39;ve been in a few accidents so I knew the process, I was in shock, I calmed my breathing, put my hazards on and waited to safely exit my vehicle as it had swerved completely away from the busy traffic. Not a single person stopped, including the person who caused me to crash off the side of the road. No one stopped, everyone assumed someone else would stop and I was stuck completely alone. Soon I was in shock simply by how disgusted I was with the driver who caused the accident and everyone who just left me. It&#39;s creepy and disheartening.", "comment_date": "2020-05-23T21:45:04Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "cheese loaf", "comment_text": "My younger brother was scared of the word marrow for quite a while", "comment_date": "2020-05-22T08:13:12Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Fiky heredia", "comment_text": "Dr. Rober White .... google that sheet", "comment_date": "2020-05-21T11:03:49Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Brian Patrick van Oers", "comment_text": "Why is John Money&#39;s twin experiment not on this list?", "comment_date": "2020-05-20T14:15:40Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Jesse Kelly", "comment_text": "&quot;Subjects would often be poor, while wealthier patients would benefit from the results of the experiments&quot; I think this is very often still true, a lot of places still do paid trials (e.g. for vaccines or treatments of illnesses) and something tells me it&#39;s not rich people lining up to do these trials.

The patient&#39;s actual reported that the test subjects were likely fakers, while the staff didn&#39;t catch one. The facility insisted on being tested again  with false patients in the mix, so they reran the experiment except they sent no one to the facility. This time however the staff had numerous patients that were fakers and were treated as such. Denying care to people with actual mental illness and crisis because they were trying decide who were the fakers and labeling people they didn&#39;t like or read well because they couldn&#39;t spot these phantom test subjects.  Proving once again the Psychiatrist&#39;s ability to pathologize any behaviour, and thus label people as disorganized and as &quot;Insane&quot; is in severe question for accuracy and especially needs to be tempered with restraint for the violation and forfeiture of rights these poor souls endure under these narcissistic psychopaths.    <br><br>Proving both times that the shrinks and their staff couldn&#39;t identify mental illness,  nor admit they had been wrong (presenting symptoms gave a first impression and that first impression couldn&#39;t be released or  revulated, they wrote in the records that the reporters taking notes behaviours for their research and story were pathological note behaviour. or fooled by actors. When confronted with this truth they abused their powers of involuntary commitment and refused to allow the patient to have access to their defense contacts.     But before that there was Elizabeth Cochrane Seaman (May 5, 1864 \u2013 January 27, 1922), better known by her pen name,  <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nellie_Bly\">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nellie_Bly</a>  who wrote a very damming expose` on the horrid conditions of mental health facilities called Ten days in the Mad House <a href=\"http://mentalfloss.com/article/29734/ten-days-madhouse-woman-who-got-herself-committed\">http://mentalfloss.com/article/29734/ten-days-madhouse-woman-who-got-herself-committed</a> .<br><br> These reports of squalor  conditions and abuse by staff, lead to some of the first many many and a never ending cycle continuing through today news of reforms the mental health industry has had to undergo when exposed for their treatment of the mentally ill.    If you think that is accient history or the mental abuse ended with 1950&#39;s  please see this very recent survey about abuse and trauma inflicted from mental hospital stays <a href=\"https://www.madinamerica.com/2018/12/mia-survey-force-trauma-sexual-abuse-mental-hospitals/\">https://www.madinamerica.com/2018/12/mia-survey-force-trauma-sexual-abuse-mental-hospitals/</a>    Psychatry should be at the front of making the experience as least traumatic as possible, but their intake process is more degrading than being arrested......   Every decade or so a bunch of bad behavior   gets outed and facilities are getting shut down but those are only the worst of the worst. Ask mental health patients how they rate their care or hospital stays for $3000-$5000 per double occupancy room with stays up to 30 days the magically insurance limit and you&#39;re then magically safe to go home.... The sheer volume of money verse the quality outcome shows extreme mismanagement of funds and treatment of patients. It would be cheaper to put them up in 5 star hotels have concierge service staff talk to them for less. The medication the staff at the hotel  would get from drug dealers will be way cheaper than the exact same medication from the hospital...But that is a pharmacy and hospital markup and billing rant/subject.<br><br>Each public outing bust that makes all the news stations, has the we have issues we are addressing and have since changed.  But history shows time and time again about every decade in never ending cycle... Psychiatrists claim they have changed &amp; you can believe us this time. The same lie you hear 100&#39;s of thousands of convicts say before a judge when it comes to their sentencing and/or parole hearing to only reoffend in less than month.  They &#39;re caught  and promising they&#39;ve turned a new corner in behaviour and standards yet again but this time it true and you really really need to give them the benefit of doubt. Despite a history ingrained through multiple decades.  These problems are like racism, it more than just one person and facility and just because they have to do_<i>_</i> because of court order and can&#39;t do or say_<i>__</i> doesn&#39;t mean that racist prejudice vindictive nature isn&#39;t there doing malicious compliance..<br><br>Because mental patients are often poor and don&#39;t have money for lawyers to sue and because they now have the stigma and prejudice of being a &quot;mental patient&quot; , their complaints of abuse , assault(physical and/or sexual) misconduct and unprofessional behaviour by staff is ignored by the public , supervisors and patient  advocates. The system has failed them, all the staff fails them and we the public fail them.<br><br>  But maybe you should listen to  Rae Unzicker the only Disabled person with Mental Illnesses who was such strong advocate that President Clinton appointed her to the head of American Disability council, the only person with such a medical background to ever hold such an office.

Last one I&#39;m familiar with was 2012 in the UK i believe, but there&#39;s probably been another one since then.<br><br>Bystander effect experiments of the type presented in this video are still done to some extent, I don&#39;t think the problem with that one is so much an ethics thing, but a lack of interest. There&#39;s an absolute ton of experiments that are similar to this, or have a similar &#39;appeal&#39; - diffusion of responsibility, basically. If you want to see something hilarious, look up the &#39;smoke filled room&#39; lines of experiment - there&#39;s plenty of videos online, freakin hilarious.", "comment_date": "2017-10-30T06:06:00Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Jisoo Kim", "comment_text": "I heard about a study where babies were put into two groups.

The study got canceled because in the first group the children kept dying and some even died after being returned to a normal environment. <br><br>I tried finding out where that study is from but even though there was similar studies on what social deprevation does to infants or infant monkeys, I couldn&#39;t find the exact study.

If we found a way to scan a brain at a certain point in time and then later completely reset said brain to that exact state effectively deleting recent memories if, under the conditions of the Belmont report, we could ethically perform these types of experiments by completely informing subjects of the nature of an experiment, getting their consent, then deleting their memories of them being informed in order to get consent without contaminating the trial. Researchers could also use the same technology to reset subjects memories again after the experiment to a scan of them giving consent, effectively deleting any psychological trauma. I seems this sort of thing could effectively cover the first and second points of the Belmont report in pretty much every regard all the time. Only problem is, you still effectively have to torture an unsuspecting human being and like, maybe just that relatively brief period of existence of causing an unsuspecting and unwilling human to suffer in and of itself could be consider unethical. Especially if you did this for long term stuff. Like what if someone agreed to do a year long experiment that would involve them getting cut open whilst conscious then sewn back together every day to test how humans can adapt to extreme physical pain over time or something absolutely atrocious. Provided the person suffers no lasting physical harm and their mental psyche isn&#39;t damaged at the end the experiment they consented to , and they&#39;re fairly compensated for the year of their time that they gave up, would it still be ethical to completely rip apart an unwitting, unwilling man time and again every day for a year?

While the ethical principles are essentially the same with psychology, what happens in the present day really is not. There are still some pretty questionable procedures that occur with clinical trials, consent, and the like. Informed consent is HUGE with medicine practices, and there are several pieces to it. Ensuring that the patient has a full understading of the procedure is one constitute, and I believe it is the one that is most often not completely achieved.If the patient agrees a procedure by means of coercion, persuasion, or manipulation - that is not consent. Technically, it is, but that&#39;s not how consent should be reached. Malpractice suits are a good example of demonstrating this mishap.
