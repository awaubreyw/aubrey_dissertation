The Hunza people are considered living proof of the health benefits of apricot kernels, based in the remote Himalayan region near West Pakistan, they are traditional apricot farmers and are believed to consume 200 times more B17 than Westerners do &quot;about 30 to 50 apricot seeds per day&quot;. Apricot kernels Cure and Prevent cancer, it is the amygdalin, vitamin B17 within that has this effect. Check out the documentary (G Edward Griffin a world without cancer the story of vitamin B17) I believe is the title, I have playlists on my channel. If interested let me know I will send you some links. The old saying an apple a day keeps the doctor away is True when you consume the whole Apple seeds included. Also check out the video titled (how to cure cancer with apricot kernels) muscular guy shaved head blue tank top in the thumbnail, Man in the video cured himself of bowel cancer, doctors gave him two months to live, Cured with bitter apricot kernels and bromelain which is a pineapple enzyme, digestive enzyme, he was taking 600 General, Digestive, Units, to Aid the absorption of the apricot kernels. He had No conventional treatment chemo, radiation, surgery or other treatment of any kind. He has been cancer-free for years now. Just a heads up guy makes a negative racial comment but video is worth watching.<br>There are multiple! cures for cancer, Natural cures these are and have been suppressed. Google (The Australian blushwood tree). If eating seeds was harmful /deadly humankind Never Would Have Made It. Think about it, think cavemen - cavewoman threw away the core : ) We evolved along with fruit fertilizing their seeds with our excrement in exchange for their nutrients, Harmony. Humans are all brainwashed this is by Design, as a child I was always told Not! to eat the core of an apple because the seeds contain cyanide, this is true but it is a Minuscule amount and it is structured in such a way not unlike Water which is two hydrogen atoms and one oxygen, harmless when together as H2O. The cyanide contained within apricot kernels and bitter almonds which use to be sold/consumed on a regular basis is Harmless to the body yet Deadly! to cancer cells, only cancer cells can unlock the cyanide and benzaldehyde molecules within the apricot kernels, Nature&#39;s Perfect Design, normal cells are 100% protected. B-17, amygdalin, Cyanide is also in Strawberries among thousands of other fruits and vegetables but in very low concentrations thanks to GMOs and Mass farming. In my opinion B-17, amygdalin is to cancer what vitamin C is to scurvy. B-17 Cyanide is also present in many grasses and wild edibles, livestock in the wintertime get what&#39;s known as winter cancers/tumors when their diets are no longer grasses but mainly corn and grain, when Spring and Summer come back around they again begin grazing the fields these tumors cancers Disappear due to the cyanide B-17 amygdalin within the grass and wild edibles they consume.<br> My Mom had cancer cured with apricot kernels, alkaline water and Essiac tea and lots of fresh juice, beet, carrot, celery, Apple you name it. People cure themselves of cancer all the time by switching to a raw vegan diet cancer cannot exist in an alkaline environment it cannot survive, apoptosis. Many fruits nuts and other foods contain vitamin B17, Cyanide it occurs naturally but B-17 is being bread out. Bitter apricot kernels have the highest natural concentration. The human body is amazing a tumor is the body&#39;s way of protecting itself containing the cancer, in my playlists there is a video of a young girl who cured herself of an inoperable brain tumor a very rare cancer with a raw vegan diet.<br> Silica from the bioavailable natural source Horsetail when taken orally remove aluminum from the body Reversing and Preventing Alzheimer&#39;s and Dementia, the silica binds to the aluminum and is carried out through the kidneys and excreted. Boron/Borax Cures arthritis and also decalcifies the pineal gland, balances hormone levels while also significantly raising testosterone among many other health benefits, Google The Borax conspiracy. Chanca piedra tea eliminates/Cures and prevents kidney and gallstones, works by gelatinizing stones. The list goes on, it&#39;s all about treating the symptom and not the cause keeping people sick and taking their money driving the numbers of the population down is the goal, at this point it is 1 in 2 for men and 1 in 3 for women will get cancer, dogs and cats that live less than 20 years on average are getting cancer nowadays this never use to happen. Think about it what do they eat our food supply is contaminated, poisoned. Scary thing is they&#39;re making everything seedless, genetically modified <br>without labels and most cannot afford to buy organic. Iodine also use to be used as a food preservative which was Beneficial for health and has Strong anticancer benefits, replaced with Bromine which causes thyroid disorders among many other negative health effects. I have Heard iodized table salt often contains 1/3 glass 1/3 sand and one third salt and is a Huge! contributor to heart attack and stroke, as the microscopic particles move through the arteries they cause micro abrasions which in turn causes plaque to form when cholesterol moves there to repair the damage done. Pink Himalayan salt is a much better choice, it also contains over 80 trace minerals that most people are deficient in. Prevention of cancer and the cure for most disease (dis-ease) is a vegan diet, raw organic is best, even if only Temporary the body must shift from acidic to alkaline, vitamin and mineral levels restored, once this takes place the body&#39;s natural defenses are restored and the body begins to  work optimally eliminating most all disease. If the body remains slightly alkaline, cancer can&#39;t survive / grow in an alkaline environment. I have heard Vitamin B17 use to be in B complex vitamins, it was removed back in the 1970s when they realize what it can do/does/was doing, the 1970s is when the documentary above was released. I have also heard that when a Gorilla is given an apricot they will instinctively crack open the pit and consume the seed/apricot kernel within.<br> Check out those two videos you&#39;ll understand where I&#39;m coming from, if you do watch the videos Please spread the word. People are dying Horrible Deaths families Destroyed for No! reason.<br>I&#39;am sharing what I consider to be Extremely !mportant information.<br>Google (can squirrels get cancer) also try Googling (do squirrels get cancer) and (foods rich in B-17)<br>You Will Understand The Connection when you do.<br>Also check out on YouTube (Third update)<br>Woman Cures herself of cancer with vitamin B17 Laetrile, I did the math she was taking the equivalent to roughly 50 apricot kernels daily in the form of laetrile, she was monitored by the hospital who was previously treating the cancer within her unsuccessfully.<br>And also check out the documentarys (What the Health) available on Netflix and possibly YouTube and (The food Matrix 101 reasons to go vegan) available on YouTube and also (Forks Over Knives). I am Not trying to push veganism if that&#39;s even a word, I just want you to be Aware of the amazing health benefits of a vegan diet, even if only temporary can completely reverse many different types of disease Dis-Ease type 2 diabetes for example.<br> Again if you would like some links message me, I will send them to you, also anyone reading this who is interested.<br><br> I have Playlist on my channel as well.<br><br>I know this all sounds to Simple But please understand and know that I have no reason to lie to you. Billions upon Billions upon Billions... of Dollars are raised and donated to cancer research Yet cancer rates continue to increase at an Extremely rapid pace.<br><br>I personally consume, on average 4 to 6 Apple&#39;s, seeds included and 10 to 15 dried bitter apricot kernels daily. I have consumed 25 apricot kernels all at once with no ill effect. <br><br>Do not take my word for it, do some research. <br><br>Please know that I am not trying to obtain subscribers that is Not at all what this is about. I have Nothing for sale.<br>If you do subscribe to my channel and have trouble accessing my cancer playlist&#39;s please notify me, I have had trouble\u00bf with this lately. <br><br>I myself have personally lost a close family Friend and an Aunt to cancer, when my Mom was diagnosed with cancer I started searching frantically and luckily came across the (How to cure cancer with apricot kernels) video. After you look into this if you believe as I do Please tell as Many! people as you can about this, Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, YouTube ECT, Printing information and links on Business cards, Bumper stickers, T-shirts, Printing information and links on computer Paper handing out to gas stations Ect for them to hand out, most will Gladly! do so. Once everyone understands that cancer is caused by a Vitamin Deficiency in my opinion, much the same as Scurvy we the Human race will have OUR! POWER Back and begin to fix the other things wrong with this world, for example fruit trees should be planted in Every climate that can sustain them, all parks along all Street mango trees, apple trees, peach, Apricot Etc. Food should be Free! For Everyone. As it stands now we have more than enough to go around More than once enough food for Everyone yet people are starving all over the world for No reason it&#39;s Wrong and Disgusting!.  <br>One last thing check out the video on YouTube (Water-fuel cell inventor murdered by government) believe it or not all engines can be easily converted to run on water, water is simply Hydrogen and Oxygen.
