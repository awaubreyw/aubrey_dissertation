I have no idea if it helped to charm them, but I also would whistle the same tune to them when I saw them. It wasn&#39;t the same tune they sing, but in a similar style. My best magpie story is that one time when hanging out washing, I had a couple parent magpies along with their juveniles hoping around the grass near me, picking bugs out of our lawn. Suddenly I heard the call of a swooping magpie (you learn this pretty quick when you live around them). Myagpie buddies began squawking at the newcomer and the swooping magpie abandoned their dive and sat on a nearby tree branch instead. I like to think that my friendly magpies were telling the aggressor that I&#39;m chill and feed them. I&#39;ve never come across any other anecdotes or research similar to this, but I thought this would be a good way to share. <br><br>I still whistle to magpies whenever I see magpies but have moved from the place I was living when I used to feed them. When I whistle, all magpies seem to cock their heads and look at me (cocking heads is done my many animals to help pinpoint the location of sounds). I don&#39;t think the whistling alone would be enough to befriend magpies, but I think maybe the &quot;attempt&quot; at conversation helps to break the ice. <br><br>I believe feeding magpies at any point, not just during breeding seasons will help you get off on the right foot with them, but haven&#39;t done enough experiments to confirm. <br><br>In truth I&#39;ve never been hurt by magpies although I&#39;ve been swooped plently of times. I have, however, had my earlobe cut by a swooping butcherbird as a child. Butcherbirds are a close relative of magpies. <br><br>Along with the porcupine (or ecidhna) helmet, you can put eye stickers or paint them on the back of your helmet.

I never get swooped because I interact with the magpies in my area during the year and they know and trust me. Befriend the magpies and you won&#39;t get swooped - and they are entertaining friends.<br>Paralysis ticks: The most common victims of these are dogs but you can get a pill that prevents dogs getting ticks and fleas. Ticks will bite humans but they can be found and removed. Most people are never in an area where they are likely to come in contact with them. By the way, &quot;cheese fries&quot; and the &quot;Outback steakhouse&quot; are American, not Australian and have nothing to do with Australia.<br>Centipedes: There are big centipedes and they are usually found in wooded areas away from cities. Most people have never seen one.<br>Strychnine Tree: About a thousand species of trees, flowers and shrubs in Australia are poisonous. Don&#39;t eat stuff unless you know what it is, is the basic rule. People follow the same rule worldwide with mushrooms. It isn&#39;t difficult. The Strychnine Tree grows along the east coast from northern NSW into Queensland. Most Australians never come across it.<br>Cone Shells: Don&#39;t pick them up, it&#39;s simple. That goes for the tiny blue-ringed octopus too. Leave them alone.<br>Gympie-Gympie Tree.  Australia is the same size as the USA (without Alaska) and you warn everyone about one tree that grows in one out-of-the-way rainforest up in far northeast Queensland. Most Australians and visitors will never go anywhere near it. If they do, they would be warned.<br>Irukandji jellyfish: Yes they are in the tropical waters of the far north coast. So are saltwater crocodiles, box jellyfish, venomous sea snakes and sharks. People do not swim off beaches in the north in the wet season. In the dry season the jellyfish have gone. Snorkelling and diving on reefs off the coast is relatively safe as the jellyfish are near the coast.<br><br>25 million people live in Australia and the most dangerous animal, the one that kills more than all the other animals and plants put together, is the horse.

They might attack strangers - I don&#39;t know.<br>Butcher birds are much worse - they attack me even if they know me, but the magpies drive them away.<br>And butcher-birds have a terrible song . not worth having around.And yes - these birds will go after your eyes when they attack - they know where you are looking and always strike from behind then strike at the eyes as they pass-over your head. If you wear a hat, they can&#39;t get to your eyes, but they are stressful and best to just kill them if they give you grief.", "comment_date": "2019-09-08T10:30:31Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "CH3353N1NJ45", "comment_text": "Cairns -  its pronounced cans, also casswaries.<br><br>Imaging a bush turkey, highly terratorial and extremely aggressive to any intruder that builds its nests in the nests of salt water crocodiles.", "comment_date": "2019-09-08T04:01:46Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Jayke Innes", "comment_text": "Wax strips will remove most hairs if applied straight away from the gympie gympie tree", "comment_date": "2019-09-07T22:42:30Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Syafran Muflih", "comment_text": "So basically creatures on Australia won&#39;t kill you, probably.

Where DO you get your information from? Obviously NOT from any reliable source(s), as almost all Australians who watched this video would know. Here are (but a few) examples:<br>1. Magpies can be found in Queensland, New South Wales, Victoria, Tasmania, South Australia and Western Australia...and not just on the coast. You (somehow) omitted at least 3 States, equal in size to over 1/4 of the U.S.<br>2. Most magpies in the southern Sates are about 40cm in size, but are generally larger in north eastern States.<br>3. The 3,200 magpie attacks and 520 injuries in 2017 alone were those requiring enough medical aid to be reported. The real number of attacks by magpies (who don&#39;t just seek out cyclists, but MAINLY pedestrian foot traffic) would easily be far in excess of 100,000. We don&#39;t like it, but (as Australians) we know it happens and take steps to avoid, and we don&#39;t make a &quot;big song and dance&quot; over it. Wrong country for that.<br>4. The most common and effective magpie deterrent adaption to helmets (and/or hats) is to paint or draw eyes on the back, not spikes around and over it.<br>5. Paralysis ticks and issues from them in Australia are exceedingly rare, so much so (if any did occur), they&#39;d make the nightly news...and they generally don&#39;t.<br>6. Outback Steakhouse aka Outback Jacks (and it&#39;s delicious American cheese fries) is NOT Australian in both concept or ownership, but an American company, originating in Canada. We have a few (but comparatively not many) here, and it would be one of the smaller chains of (American) food places.<br>7. The 16cm centipede is NOT found &quot;pretty much everywhere in Australia&quot;. Much smaller ones however are...and yes, their bite hurts.<br>8. Strychnine trees are real but exceedingly rare and sparse. So much so, you&#39;d have to go searching for a long time (days, weeks or months) in most places to find one.", "comment_date": "2019-06-14T08:51:46Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "pdix", "comment_text": "You forgot Australian citizens (minus aborigines)", "comment_date": "2019-06-14T06:17:15Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Renovartio", "comment_text": "shoot the birds", "comment_date": "2019-06-13T13:10:35Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "CipherVR", "comment_text": "first one is magpie haha they are annoying but don&#39;t see them as dangerous. i think the only dangerous thing is bad drivers.", "comment_date": "2019-06-13T10:07:11Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "guillermo pino", "comment_text": "bruh i see like 5 magpies a day, they&#39;re  just creepy but they wont hurt you unless u run towards them.", "comment_date": "2019-06-12T11:26:21Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Hazis Duka", "comment_text": "that&#39;s the reason I want to live in Australia &quot;danger&quot;", "comment_date": "2019-06-11T21:05:33Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Kaden Herzog", "comment_text": "Exactly why I\u2019m probably never going and if I do I\u2019m NOT swimming even in a pool", "comment_date": "2019-06-11T17:48:28Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Michael Dunn", "comment_text": "Well there is a tree called g bunk and if you eat there berry a hand full equals to about 100 oranges in vitman c", "comment_date": "2019-06-09T06:07:58Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Michael Dunn", "comment_text": "I have got swooped by one when i was riding my bike with my bike helmet which  was shiny keept attacking me i was so scared", "comment_date": "2019-06-09T06:03:26Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "guringai", "comment_text": "As an Australian, I think I have a more realistic list of scary creatures. <br>Clive Palmer, about to wreck the planet with a new gigantic coal mine.<br>Scomo.

It is in fact the guiness book record holder for <b>the</b> most dangerous ant in the world.  But what makes it so special you ask? Well...<br>The damn thing is a 5cm long ant, so about the size of your pinky, somehow trapped in a sort of suspended state of evolution, with a reusable stinger on it&#39;s back just like wasps have, except that this one carries one of the most potent substance in the insect world. On top of that, unlike, all other ants, these bad boys have propper vision, big wide eyes allowing them to see clearly as far as two meters away.<br>Now what got them their name of bull-ants is not their size, nor their hellish mandibules, it is their aggressivity. They will pick a fight with anything that they see move using their sharp eyesight, be it a bettle, a cat, a python, or a 2m tall human, regardless of any sort of self-preservation instinct. Hand-sized Wolf and huntsmen spiders won&#39;t even fight back if they end up cornered by one of them, they will just try to run even if there&#39;s no way out. And they are wise to do so, there&#39;s not a chance that their mandibules will manage to pierce a bull ant&#39;s  heavily reinforced skelleton, which can <b><i>withstand the weight of a human adult standing on it</i></b> .<br>As for their sting, well, i know quite a bit about it myself. It&#39;s about as painfull as i picture giving birth would be, i&#39;d define it as someone ripping open your flesh and hammering on a nerv with a chisel. Though thankfully the worst of the pain stops under half an hour. It can provoke a choc sufficient to make you throw up if you got stung multiple times, and will attack your flesh, leaving a bruise-like pattern for months. It will also itch pretty badly for weeks.<br><br>On top of all of that, remember their suspended state of evolution? These ants don&#39;t even need a queen. They have one, but can reproduce between workers and sustain their colony for years without her.<br><br>They have a smaller cousin too, refered to as bull ants as well, but also as &quot;jack jumpers&quot;. While the stinger of these nasty things pack less of a punch than the one of it&#39;s bigger cousin, they trade their weight for the ability to leap in split-second onto other objects, <b><i>and humans</i></b> .<br><br>Now if you haven&#39;t been horrified by this, i suggest that you look what these ants look like on a quick google search.", "comment_date": "2019-02-12T05:47:56Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Monkey Monk", "comment_text": "I feed the Magpies, they sing beautifully.

They just run away, like most snakes. Also, all aussie snakes have both poor eyesight, and small fangs.

Sure they make you feel like utter hell and sometimes antibiotics are needed but never heard of someone becoming allergic to meat, if you do go into the scrub, wear long sleeves and when out check EVERYWHERE for ticks, even behind your ears. You might be thinking of the Lone Star tick and that&#39;s in the US. Also Outback Steakhouse is NOT Aussie <b>angry shook noises</b><br>Strychnine Tree: Yeah no one eats random fruit off trees. Hell trying to get an Aussie to eat any fruit is tricky xD<br>Good old cone snail shells!: HAHAHA yeah they are nasty, old gold rule: if it&#39;s in the water leave it be. Also wear solid soled water shoes.<br>Gympie Gympie tree: STAY. ON. THE. PATHS. WHEN. NATURE. WALKING. AND. PAY. ATTENTION. TO. SIGNS! Seriously, please it&#39;s dangerous also take photos! Beautiful scenery up top!<br>Common KingSlayer: I REPEAT THE NATURE WALK WARNING! Keep an eye out for signs on beaches, DO YOUR RESEARCH! It&#39;s a quick 5 minute google, dont be an idiot or &#39;tough&#39; mother nature does not care. Stay between the flags or out of the water if it&#39;s not a dedicated area or a local swimming hole and if you&#39;re completely unsure, just go into a local store or find a life guard and ask. We wont bite, but we can keep you from getting hurt and STAY BETWEEN THE RED AND YELLOW FLAGS!
