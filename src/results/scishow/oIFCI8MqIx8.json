The studies has shown wide range of contradicting results, and none have ever claimed it causes 95% of all stomach cancer. In fact much cancer research shows the exact opposite, &quot;Several studies have detected an inverse relationship between H. pylori infection and gastric cardia cancer. The possibility of an inverse relationship between the bacterium and gastric cardia cancer is supported by the corresponding decrease in H. pylori infection rates in Western countries during the past century\u2014the result of improved hygiene and widespread antibiotic use\u2014and the increase in rates of gastric cardia cancer in these same regions.&quot; ~The National Cancer Institute. <br>The most we have been able to tell is there is a rare mutation in some H. pylori that is classified as cagA-positive.
