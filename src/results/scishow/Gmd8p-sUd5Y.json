I concede that Dr. Six certainly is more informed that I am on the matter, but I suspect she may have misspoke, and meant to say that up to 80% of mature lodgepole pine in BC will be dead by the end of the MPB outbreak, which is a statistic I&#39;ve seen before. MPB is undoubtedly an enormous problem here and has killed many lodgepole pine, in some regions up to 100% of them, but definitely not all trees all over BC. Not yet, anyway. MPB has begun to spread to jack pine too, which means it&#39;s heading further north into the boreal biome. <br>Thank you for once again shining a spotlight on the MPB outbreak.

I selected a stick and pushed and prodded the porcupine to go away. The porcupine was determined to stay. With some vigor, I encouraged it to leave and eventually it did. However, it wasn&#39;t done. It moved about 50 feet away and started vocalizing. For the next 6 hours, until dawn, I was serenaded with intermittent crying baby sounds and various grunts, buzzing sounds and generally disgruntled sounding porcupine complaints. I considered shooting it (after hours of not sleeping) and I checked on porcupine recipes, but my copy of &quot;Wilderness Almanac&quot; suggested that would have been very inappropriate as porcupines have been considered &quot;emergency food&quot; by First Nations people due to their relative ease of acquisition.
