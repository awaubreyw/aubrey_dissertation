When he realised he had actually caught something, he leaned in to start munching. I felt his little mandibles nibbling at my skin and thought to myself &quot;If I give him 5-10 minutes he MIGHT break my skin, so I should think of a solution quickly.&quot; Thankfully, he&#39;d grabbed the tip of my finger, meaning half his arm was only pressing against my finger nail and unable to pierce it with his rose-thorn-like spines. I was able to twist my finger in just the right way to make him lose his grip. He let go, looked vaguely confused, but mainly unbothered by the experience. ^^  I closed the terrarium and went to wash my finger thoroughly where his spines had poked skin. Nothing adverse happened to me either. ^^<br><br>Sometimes I think I&#39;d like a pet mantis that was a foot long, because it would be easier to interact with it, but then I remember how dumb they are and how much more capable it would be of munching me and settle for the 2-10cm ones. x)", "comment_date": "2020-05-18T13:05:45Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Kevin Luo", "comment_text": "The url: <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOe-lFF2XE4\">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOe-lFF2XE4</a>", "comment_date": "2020-05-13T18:39:29Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "MetallicaLife4", "comment_text": "Face-hugging beetles, fish-snaring worms and brain-slurping insects?

I was hiking in the woods of Choctaw County, Alabama, one summer morning, back in the late 1980s.  Being a bit parched on that sunny, steamy day, I stopped for a cool drink of water from my canteen, and after a few moments, noticed an irritating prickling and burning around my lower legs.  As I&#39;m a bit sensitive to brushing against certain kinds of grasses native to the area, I dismissed it as that.  As the sensation kept creeping higher, though, I also noticed the feeling of things crawling on me.  In that moment, I looked down and discovered that I&#39;d chosen to stop with my feet right in the middle of a fire-ant mound that had been somewhat hidden by weeds growing around it, and now had hundreds of the vicious buggers all over my legs and inside my shoes, stinging assiduously.  I later did an estimate and came up with a rough tally of around 200 stings across both legs.  <br><br>After retreating to a safe distance, I brushed off the ants on my legs, and removed most of the ones in my socks and shoes.  I soon began to feel a bit shaky, and decided to return home, which was only 10 minutes&#39; walk away.   By the time I got there, I was shaking all over and feeling curious chills and weakness -- could hardly hold a cup of coffee steady enough to take a sip.<br><br>Fortunately, that&#39;s as bad as it got, but it was a stark reminder that even tiny poisonous beasts can cause real trouble in sufficient numbers.", "comment_date": "2019-11-22T06:37:31Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "I'm listening", "comment_text": "This was hottifying....", "comment_date": "2019-11-18T22:37:17Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "H Grey", "comment_text": "&quot; lacking a back bone does not make you spineless&quot; that&#39;s the take away", "comment_date": "2019-11-18T20:35:51Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Undeviated", "comment_text": "Last time someone&#39;s house was invaded by a coconut crab and a snake.
