Mollusks are organic creatures and don&#39;t function at constant intervals. They can build up more or less calcium based on the health of the oyster. The availability of calcium in an environment will fluctuate and conditions will change so it is impossible to get an accurate enough picture of an environment to tell how it would affect the growth of the mollusk.<br><br>Same with studying ice cores or carbon 14. Ice cores would melt at an inconstant rate and the layers of ice can be affected by untimely stretches of days. Yes it might be permafrost and it might be building up layers of ice that doesn&#39;t thaw after a given amount of burying but the rate at which it buries or to how or when it gets affected are unknowns. Field work cannot be treated as lab work and assumptions cannot be made about the nature of the life of an object. <br><br>Carbon 14 decays at a steady rate and you can estimate the period of time between now and when it was most stable but it&#39;s not good for dating historical events because there are a lot of assumptions on what stage of decay the carbon was in at that time and what stage the control sample is at. You can do the math and then subtraction but there&#39;s still a high degree of variability.
