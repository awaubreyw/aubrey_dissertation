So I am quite certain I would be capable of their abilities, and maybe even surpass it due to the ridiculous amount of neurons dedicated to this sense. Interestingly humans have better equipment then even dogs to decode the inputs form olfactories, so we might have less olfactories, but they are significantly more effective due to the underlying support from more neurons actually processing the info. The idea that humans have poor smell is a myth created to explain freewill, story goes in comparison to brain size, less of our brain size is dedicated to the olfactory bulb, which in and off it self is correct, however this was assumed that the frontal lobe has taken the place of the olfactory bulb, and thus at the expense of smell we have become more self aware, however the key thing here is the human brain is massive in comparison to cats and dogs, giving us a distinct advantage over processing the information because physically in real terms the olfactory bulb is bigger then cats and dogs, because our brains are so much bigger then theirs, and thus even though a smaller percentage of the brain is focused on smell, the size of the brain far outweighs other smaller animals, and is so doing not only makes up for it, but exceeds that of other smaller animals.", "comment_date": "2022-04-14T14:43:03Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Rosy Glow", "comment_text": "&quot;Please pet all your cats for me and tell them I love them.&quot;<br><br>I second that.", "comment_date": "2022-04-10T14:39:32Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Trevor", "comment_text": "My sister and I call the Flehmen Response the &#39;Stank Face&#39;", "comment_date": "2022-04-10T03:09:47Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Nyx", "comment_text": "Cats are the greatest things to exist.", "comment_date": "2022-04-08T03:20:11Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "ultra apple", "comment_text": "Big cats don&#39;t have a fully calcefied bone-thing, and humans have the same thing...

My favourite game is to get kittehs ready to play, get my hand completely trapped in the cat trap of jaws and teeth and then keep completely still. Without fail when I stop struggling they all lose interest in following through and they either loosen their grip so I can escape, or push or kick my hand away at this surrender/playing dead so I only get the lightest of scratches. If I HAD managed to get scratched by that time I certainly wouldn&#39;t blame the cat.<br><br>Respect cats&#39; boundaries and they&#39;ll respect you. If they&#39;re growling or sending warning signals or playful signals they tend to be extremely obvious. I never understand how people get scratches on their face - what&#39;s your face doing so close to a creature that barely comes up to your knee? Generally that&#39;s YOUR fault, don&#39;t go doing inhumane things like declawing a cat simply for having boundaries, if you don&#39;t want to get scratched respect the cat&#39;s boundaries, don&#39;t play if you don&#39;t know how to read when the cat wants to be left alone. They send the most obvious body language signals of any creature I&#39;ve ever met, way more obvious and consistent than humans in the warnings they give. Plus a lot of their responses they can&#39;t really help if they get overstimulated so don&#39;t blame them if you get scratched, learn from Jackson Galaxy how to calm them down.<br><br>The only time I&#39;ve had deep scratches were one time I volunteered my arm to be a springboard for a cat leaping from a tree (clearly accidental from the cat and I should&#39;ve just gotten out of the way but I was a kinda dumb teen), and when my sister&#39;s dog pawed my calf in a painful friendly manner with his nails which were exceptionally long and needed a trim. I&#39;ve had cats my entire life and every time I went to visit someone they&#39;d always warn me that their cat was scratchy and vicious and that was never the case. I&#39;m in my 30s now and always gravitated towards cats at people&#39;s houses (no, I didn&#39;t pet strays because I still want to be smart and safe - was warned about diseases and never assumed they were tame or wanted to be petted and didn&#39;t want to encourage them to trust strange humans who might be bad people so I&#39;m not advocating people should take silly risks or be as playful with housecats as I am either, just that people should read cats&#39; body language and treat them and their boundaries with respect rather than imposing your will on the cat and then getting angry it didn&#39;t want to play. In my experience, besides being playful, house cats respect people who respect them, and chasing your feet or swiping playfully as you go past is a far cry from the type of deep scratches that would only come from a serious fight with a cat. A<br><br>lso, all that aside, there is no excuse for declawing or any other type of animal abuse.  Just don&#39;t have an animal or a kid if you&#39;re not willing to learn the proper way to take care of them - you choose to have them in order to serve and love them unconditionally, they&#39;re not there to fulfil or complete you, fulfil your insecurities and they don&#39;t owe you anything. If you didn&#39;t get a choice to have them don&#39;t take it out on them, they certainly didn&#39;t choose this life.", "comment_date": "2022-01-27T13:22:58Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "CuriousNerdKitteh", "comment_text": "Our two dogs loved to personally greet, escort and welcome every visitor&#39;s car arriving at the gate.

He had a huge ego and was a truly great spirit. Though small he ruled the house. He was horribly injured and almost died defending another housecat from a marauding stray German Shepard that escaped a neighborhood house. While both my beloved Fido, a very delicate and feminine Persian, and the attacking dog (blinded by Patsy in the attack) died because of their injuries, Patsy lived on to beyond 20 years of age. He was the toughest, most masculine and self confident creature I have had the privileged of knowing. I said &quot;great spirit&quot; and i meant it.<br><br><br>That cat was unflappable. Neighbors were adopted after they moved in by a giant rough Tom they named Beast. Beast was truly an &quot;outside cat&quot; but showed up when he needed a meal. In exchange he brought my neighbors presents, usually opossums the size of Patsy or larger. His torn ears and many scars were evidence of a life lived on the road, finding comfort where he pleased and bringing death to many a creature. Beast was the biggest &quot;domesticated&quot; cat I have ever seen. If Patsy heard the rattle of kibble into a dish next door he would run over and shoulder Beast out of the way until his belly was full. Beast never complained, just watching quizzically.<br><br><br>I say all this, and there is much more I could say, to set the stage, to give you an glimpse of understanding into patsy&#39;s weakness. While Patsy enjoyed marijuana, he would come and ask for the smoke to be blown into his face (hey, it was the &#39;70s), he had no weakness to catnip. Cantaloupes, however, were quire another matter. He LOVED cantaloupes, not the flesh, just the skin. he would chew it, gnaw it, wallow in it, and become hopelessly intoxicated. <br><br><br>This wasn&#39;t a casual attraction. I have had the misfortune of knowing a couple junkies.

This goes both ways, animals will be affected by us in this manner also so reducing contact with animals and maintaining appropriate contact is best... this mean not letting your cat lick your face or body, maintain space because infection is bi directional, washing your hands before and after touching the animal... this is not easy. At a minimum wash before consuming food or drink or touching anything food related, wash all surfaces before touching food because cats like counters. Litter boxes need daily or more maintenance and routine replacement of media and disinfection of the area and boxes. Do not use your cats as mousers or expect them to do all the dirty work pest wise, keep traps for mice and rats and remove the body immediately, if your cat does catch something do not let it eat it, dispose of and clean up. A show simply on parasites would be good to show people the dangers and methods of contact. I could chat on the subject for days.
