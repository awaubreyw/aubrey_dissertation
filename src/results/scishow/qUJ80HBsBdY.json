There are some minor inaccuracies in this video that I noticed and wanted to point out. I used to work as a telemetry technician within the medical field for a living, which meant continuously reading different patients&#39; EKGs for 12 hours at a time. At <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qUJ80HBsBdY&amp;t=2m12s\">2:12</a> in this video, you guys present different rhythms a patient&#39;s heart could be in. The rhythm you guys have labeled as &quot;normal heartbeat&quot; isn&#39;t actually normal. If I remember correctly, it looks like a sinus rhythm with a second-degree type 2 heart block and a bundle branch block. Notice how there are two little waves in that rhythm before a big triangle-looking wave. Both of those little waves are called p-waves, while the big triangle looking wave is called a QRS complex. The medium-sized wave following the QRS complex is called a T-wave. In a normal rhythm, aka normal sinus rhythm, there should only be a one to one to one ratio of the p-wave, QRS complex, and t-wave, which represents a single heartbeat. But since there are two p-waves for each heartbeat, that means the patient has a second-degree type 2 heart block. The QRS complex is also larger than normal, indicating a bundle branch block. Either way, I still love the work you guys do, and will continue to recommend you guys to my family and friends when to comes science.", "comment_date": "2022-06-05T08:23:59Z", "likes_count": 6}, {"comment_by": "David O'Banion", "comment_text": "Who stole his bolo tie?", "comment_date": "2022-06-05T07:46:09Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Chirantan Nath", "comment_text": "Heart attacks are the number 1 cause?

In the 1980s, scientists were able to use X-rays to examine the hearts of over 300 survivors of heart attacks and discover that they could withstand certain obstructions over time. After decades of research, doctors have finally conclusively identified what causes heart attacks: they are caused by clots forming in the arteries supplying oxygen and nutrients to the heart.
