Ironically, or sadly, the very news outlets you bemoaned at the start got it right while you got it wrong. The findings, as you presented them, are only a part of the findings and if you don&#39;t know that, you have no business talking about research (the only other episode you got wrong also involved research so you may want to stay away from that area until you become competent in the subject matter). First, take this video down because it is dangerous and may end up killing someone in a couple weeks. Second, make a second video and explain the hows and whys this one was so very wrong - and present the correct findings and you could use it to show exactly how research is correctly used. This presentation is wholly wrong - in its approach and in its pronouncements. Research is NEVER done in isolation and the Duke U project was done in conjunction with two earlier studies. One published in June showed no benefit from bandana-type masks; a second published in July duplicated the findings of the first. This study looked at what possible mechanism explained the findings of the first two studies - which it did. The findings are that bandana-type masks offer no protection due to the aerosolizing effect they have been shown to have on exhaled droplets. This is why access to research should be restricted only to those qualified to discuss it competently. And, if I&#39;m not mistaken, the first two research projects are cited in the Duke U one - which eliminates any possibility of claiming ignorance of their existence. I have used somewhere in the area of 100 of your shows as supplements for my students for good reason - they are trustworthy. You have presented yourself as a trustworthy source; as such there is also a liability involved as, if you present incorrect information, you can be held liable for damages because you present yourself as a reliable and trustworthy source of information.
