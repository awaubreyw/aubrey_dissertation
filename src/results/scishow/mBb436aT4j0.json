RTX is a chemical that activates heat-sensitive neurons that have a receptor called TRPV1. TRPV1 triggers pain brought about from fire when exposed to high temperatures or acid, so techanally when you eat spicy food, your brain thinks you\u2019re getting burned. With this effect in place, RTX amplifies this, making it near to deadly. You would think this stuff coud only be made in a lab, but its actually found prominent in a cactus-like plant called Morocco. Better yet, scientists also intend to make this chemical useable in medicine.

I&#39;ve unsubscribed from several channels that started consistently uploading sub-5 minute content with these long ads.<br>  I don&#39;t mean to be overly negative, and I am all for SciShow monetizing wherever possible. I think the cliche ads from the dozen or so companies everyone does ads for, have long long overstayed their welcome. In my opinion the future on this platform is following Mr. Linus (Tech Tips and others (no affiliation)). That dude has it dialed. I&#39;m not a fanboi. I don&#39;t watch half or more of his content, and I hate clickbait titles. However he has one thing perfectly on the mark. The future is definitely the ultra short and fresh in-content ads placed according to the CC&#39;s discretion, with the CC being highly cognizant of what they are plugging and putting their endorsement on. Linus&#39; in content ads are almost comical, relevant, and effective. IMO, he&#39;s revisiting the early TV and Radio style ads and doing it well. Companies like SciShow really really need to recognize this new shift in marketing and follow suit IMO.
