So the question one may wonder is the spiritual cost to one&#39;s own soul and spirit for having lived and died to the lowest standards of quality for so many years now global pollution has diminished the quality of life to the point where today&#39;s people are living, dying and yielding the worst spiritual kickback that has ever been manifested since the beginning of life only getting worse.  The polar opposite extreme to that is today&#39;s people should be living and dying to the highest standards of quality which would make each and every moment physically, mentally, financially and spiritually beneficial.

I&#39;m a long-time viewer short time member. I love your channels and have being inspired to do my part in renewable energy. I have designed and built a thermal capacitor that can utilize the phase change of different kinds of Wax. The cheapest and most locally-sourced wax available to me currently was beeswax which just so happens to have the melting Point most desirable for the application I want to use it for. Beeswax melts at 60 degrees C which is a very usable temperature for space Heating if it is used correctly. Utilizing phase-change materials as a means of storing energy is not a new idea. People have been grappling with the idea of utilizing wax as a means of storing thermal energy. The problem that people keep running into when trying to use wax for thermal storage arises when you try to extract the Heat stored in the wax. The solution I have come up with and I&#39;m trying to prove is in the design of the heat exchanger used to extract the Heat. The concept is simple instead of trying to use a small efficient heat exchanger you use a large inefficient heat exchanger that will allow the heat to be extracted slowly enough and more evenly throughout the wax preventing it from solidifying and becoming a thermal insulator around the heat exchanger. If you are reading this comment please share any thoughts that you may have to improve and develop this concept.", "comment_date": "2022-02-16T15:00:41Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "astrolover 95", "comment_text": "If AC DC is giving you a headache then I would recommend you turn the volume down.", "comment_date": "2022-01-18T12:18:54Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "David Niemi", "comment_text": "Being renewable or not is not the main factor in the reliability of sources of electricity.  There are many forms of renewable energy with very different strengths and weaknesses -- those that depend on heat and generators have similar reliability characteristics to fossil fuels.  Note that feeding a large coal plant is no small engineering feat either -- it requires massive amounts of coal being extracted in dangerous ways and transported long distances, and stockpiled by the kiloton, which is even before you make any attempt to make it a little less unbelievably harmful to the environment.  And our traditional energy grids are inefficient and prone to unstable interactions that cause cascading blackouts.  There are challenges no matter your fuel sources, we are far from solving our century-old challenges and the new ones are not necessarily harder to fix.<br><br>Solar has the advantage of being most available at the times the most air conditioning is used, so it makes a good natural supplement.  But as pointed out it is not feasible to use as your only energy source without some way to store a huge amount of this energy at a manageable long-term cost (lithium iron phosphate is way to expensive to be a good answer but there are other options).  Wind is one of the most cost-effective renewables but also requires some kind of storage system if it is to be your primary energy source.<br><br>The fossil fuels are not all equal either -- natural gas is the cleanest, easier to get where it&#39;s needed, and currently the least costly, so there is no good reason to use coal to generate electricity in the long term.  And natural gas is also fairly easy to make from many renewable sources, so conversion to those is fairly straightforward.<br><br>Note that hydrogen is not a meaningful fuel source.  It is a way of storing energy that can be used in a fuel cell or burned.  But it is hard to work with and hard to store, so don&#39;t think of it as the answer to clean energy, just one possible second-to-last hop among several others.<br><br>The bottom line here is that not all energy sources have the same characteristics, and this is a good thing if we mix them intelligently.", "comment_date": "2022-01-18T03:38:25Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "MrMegaPussyPlayer", "comment_text": "<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIMBr_uTPkE&amp;t=8m17s\">8:17</a> But the begin of the Highway to Hell?<br>\u3030\ud83c\udfb5\ud83c\udfb6Highwaaaaay \u3030 toooo \u3030Heeeeeeell\ud83c\udfb5", "comment_date": "2022-01-18T01:34:53Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "George Washington", "comment_text": "This guy looks like a baby and this commercial is propaganda for the new world order", "comment_date": "2022-01-17T01:13:52Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "chubs thecow", "comment_text": "When I heard &quot;speaking of current&quot; I got ready to skip a sponsor for current banking -_-", "comment_date": "2022-01-14T18:21:17Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Jack X", "comment_text": "Climate &quot;crisis&quot;?

Nuclear is like the complete opposite of renewables, with the former being too consistent (producing the same amount of power with limited ability to vary output) while the latter is as inconsistent as the weather (climate change much?).<br><br>Nuclear, which has one of the lowest LCOE&#39;s of any energy source, operates at almost full capacity almost all the time, meaning power it produces in the middle of the night or at noon when renewables are just gushing power at zero marginal cost onto the grid, that power is just wasted, as there&#39;s likely not the same level of demand for the plant&#39;s power at 2am as there is at 6pm. Cheap energy storage would allow nuclear plants to bank all the power it produces and release it almost directly in-line with demand, i.e. load follow. That would let a given nuclear plant serve more people, as you&#39;d have a lot more energy available at any given time, and at an even lower average cost, as you wouldn&#39;t have to price your electricity so that the income from electricity produced at 6pm would offset losses from electricity produced at 2am. <br><br>Additionally, energy storage can really only help renewables spread the energy they produce over a day or two, making the power generated over a small window available over a longer span of time (there&#39;s no storage method that can store that amount of power, enough to provide a city, for example, with power for a day or two, but one day there probably will be (assume we don&#39;t all die before that method is developed)). However, even in that fantastic future where we can store significant amounts of electricity for a couple days, that dream energy storage method STILL won&#39;t do anything to address issues like the wind drought northern Europe is currently going through or if you&#39;ve got cloudy weather for weeks or months (like in the fall or winter). If you go weeks to months without significant wind or sun exposure, even with fantasy batteries, you&#39;re still boned. Nuclear, on the other hand, is ALWAYS producing and would thus always accrue the benefits provided by cheap energy storage.<br><br>I could continue talking about how much more sense nuclear makes than renewables, but I&#39;m going to stop because I support any POTENTIAL energy source that could possibly replace baseload power from coal or nat. gas, AND! be as cheap OR cheaper than fossil fuels. I support nuclear because it, with a median LCOE of $69 USD/MWh, already does both, and cheap energy storage and Gen 4 reactors will make it STUPID cheap &amp; efficient. Renewables, outside hydro, don&#39;t do either if you eliminate the mountains of subsidies they get. HOWEVER, with a cheap and effective storage method, like Ambri&#39;s liquid metal batteries :), they might be able to make a material contribution to a non-fossil fuel grid.

Yeah yeah, I know, it&#39;s displacement, but go with me here.<br><br>Take a large, air tight container, attach it to a cable, and anchor it to the bottom of a large body of water with either a waterproofed generator and gearbox assembly or a pulley linking it to said assembly on land.  When you have an excess of energy, you pull the float down.  When you need electricity, you let it up, turning the generator.  The size of the float, length of the cable, and gearing of the mechanism can all be sized appropriately for nearly any location with a body of water.

Put a wave power generator between the shore and the float, and you have a minimal amount of area that can generate power nearly constantly depending on the body of water.  With multiple installations along a coastline that would otherwise be unfit for recreational use, you have the potential for massive amounts of storage and generation with minimal ecological impact and minimal obstruction.  <br><br>If you go with the submerged generator and gearbox idea, the float could be kept below the depths that ships would need to worry about it, and the power cables can be run to land the same way they do for offshore wind generation.

We are so many years ahead of you; while you are still thinking about whether something would be possible, we have already integrated it into our power supply. Austria is converting one conventional hydroelectric power plant after another into pumped storage power plants - as we speak. Norway became one giant battery two months ago when the extra-high voltage direct current line between Norway and Germany went into operation. Norway has 10,000(!) conventional hydropower plants that <b>don&#39;t</b> need to be converted to pumped storage, because Norway has been consuming its own hydropower until now. But in the future they won&#39;t, but draw excess power from the European interconnected grid for their own needs and leave their water in storage. Only when there is too little energy in the interconnected grid do they start up their hydropower plants and thus stabilize the grid - together with the Austrians. Just yesterday, a study came out that proves that huge storage facilities are not needed at all to stabilize the grid, as has always been thought. A few relatively small battery storage units are quite enough to stabilize a huge interconnected grid like the European one. Similarly, renewables have been shown not to have destabilized the grid, but to have made it <b>more</b> stable! Munich (with 1.5 million inhabitants) has just recently converted its municipal utilities from gas to geothermal, which provides base load, so the base load issue is also being addressed. Speaking of geothermal: Geothermal has been used for energy production in the Eifel region for years, but it turns out that the water contains a fair amount of lithium. So now they&#39;re filtering it out and thus have an absolutely environmentally friendly lithium extraction, since the water is 100% pumped back into the same layer of earth, just a bit colder and without lithium. I could go on like this for another hour, but not with coulda, shoulda, woulda, but with lots of concrete examples, where all this is already integrated into the power grid or will be in the very near future.<br>Come on, America, get your act together and just do it, too!

This kind of storage is pretty old, but modern ones make use of modern technology such as being suspended magnetically in a vacuum, minimising drag.
