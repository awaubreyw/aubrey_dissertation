And now, in my career, I&#39;ve worked with people from India, The Gambia, The UK, Kenya, Mexico, Morocco and I&#39;m sure quite a few I&#39;m not thinking of.

Honestly, there&#39;s very little of my education that didn&#39;t come in handy at some point. And some of the biggest breakthroughs happening right now are in multi-disciplinary topics.

I&#39;ve been thinking all this for years! I&#39;m so excited to see this talked about it on here! and something that I&#39;ve been thinking about that&#39;s along the same train of thought is the idea of a wild verse domesticated animal? and why is it so horrendous to take a wild animal from it&#39;s habitat? Taking an animal from it&#39;s home and then treating it poorly or not giving it what it needs to thrive is 100% bad, but if you&#39;re making the animals life more comfortable if you feed it well and keep it safe and happy then I don&#39;t understand the problem? but really the idea that there&#39;s an inherent difference between the wild and civilization just because humans made buildings is absurd! we just changed our habitat to fit our needs like any burrowing or building animal. I don&#39;t here people calling ant hills a civilization but its the same idea just on a much smaller scale! we act like other animals don&#39;t belong here and that&#39;s silly, really people talk and act as if humans are alien invaders on earth who are carelessly ruining this magic planet we found when we are native to earth! and yeah it sucks that we&#39;re probably gonna cause (or have caused I don&#39;t know) the next mass extinction, but the earth will survive and so will life, life has survived much worse things then the humans messing up our own environment. death is necessary for life, with out it there would be no food and or we&#39;d run out of space. and yeah it sucks especially since most of it is preventable, and we should prevent those things but humans aren&#39;t evil for failing that just like the meteorite wasn&#39;t evil for killing the dinosaurs! (I know that&#39;s not 100% accurate but my point still stands)  and yeah the meteorite has no thought or will but 99% of humans have close to no control over the environmental disasters anyway its law makers and corporations that are doing the worst damage, and people like brit who work so hard to try and help earth with science who can make the best change! but not everyone can be a scientist and not everyone can be a law maker who does good...
