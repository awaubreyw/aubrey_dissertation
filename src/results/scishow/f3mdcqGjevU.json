Stop being the tit off of which the\r<br>corporations suck and suck and keep sucking you dry.\r<br>\r<br>What kind of razor do you use?  Is it one for which you need to buy blades?  \r<br>Does it have a lubricating/moisturizing strip?  How often do you need to \r<br>replace the blades and how much does that cost?\r<br>\r<br>I remember when I was young, everyone knew that Kodak could give their cameras \r<br>away.  We all knew it was because they made all their money on the film.\r<br>\r<br>I remember the first &quot;action figure&quot;, G.I. Joe.  They had wanted a doll for boys\r<br>but you couldn&#39;t call it a doll.  Boys wouldn&#39;t have any of that.  So they \r<br>called it an action figure.  Well, the thing that made G. I. Joe so successful \r<br>was that once they got you to buy the, um, action figure, then you had to buy \r<br>all the stuff that went with it, the tanks, the canons, the helicopters and on \r<br>and on.  Even way back then they already had a name for it.  It is the classic \r<br>razor/razor blade marketing strategy.\r<br>\r<br>When I was a child, I spoke as a child.  But when I became a man, I put away my\r<br>safety razor and started using an adult&#39;s razor.  A real razor.  A straight \r<br>razor.\r<br>\r<br>And there is one reason. - I don&#39;t like supporting a company that only thinks of\r<br>their customers as cash cows.  &quot;Let&#39;s milk them for all we can.&quot;  That&#39;s all the\r<br>respect they have for the customer, and that&#39;s no respect at all.  They have all\r<br>the technology to make whatever they like but all they care about is the next \r<br>quarterly report.\r<br>\r<br>Those moisturizing strips don&#39;t do anything like moisturize.  What they do is \r<br>degrade in a predictable length of time so the angle of the head is such that \r<br>the blades will cut you and tear rather than give a good shave.  Not only do \r<br>they have you buying new blades all the time but they have you do it on their \r<br>schedule.  Is that something you want to let them do to you?\r<br>\r<br>One day I came home from work and noticed in my mail box, a new razor, one of \r<br>those four blade wonders, and I thought to myself, yeah.  Just like heroine\r<br>dealers, &quot;The first one is free&quot;.\r<br>\r<br>So I bought a Dovo, all stainless, straight razor, and have been happy ever \r<br>since.\r<br>\r<br>I have now, for the past few years, already spent all the money I will ever \r<br>need to in order to shave.\r<br>\r<br>Liberate yourself from the corporate milking machine.

A straight razor is an intensely delicate instrument, with a good one being really hard and brittle, rather than flexible like a spring. These will shatter very easily, but won&#39;t bend, and will have minimal edge rolling occurring during normal use, and their design specializes in minimizing edge roll by having a curve along the width of the blade, which stiffens things considerably. Stropping helped further with edge retention, which is why a good barber regularly stropped, but didn&#39;t sharpen his razor nearly as often. Cartridge razors can&#39;t be stropped, and are designed to flex a great deal, and are usually stainless (or nearly so), none of which are helpful if you want either a sharp edge in the first place, or to maintain an edge. Note, those soft spots you mention are more of a drawback/feature of stainless steel, if hard enough carbon steel was used, it would be less of an issue, as this has harder &#39;soft&#39; spots. <br><br>I suspect the sheer thinness of disposable blades is also an issue here, with the blades being insufficient to the task, because a thinner blade is cheaper/easier to fit 12 of them in one cartridge.", "comment_date": "2020-11-29T10:24:05Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "deepsy2k", "comment_text": "Too dull to cut my beard, but sharp enough to give me cuts, what am I missing here?", "comment_date": "2020-11-29T10:21:43Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Claressa Lucas", "comment_text": "Honest question: why don&#39;t we have ceramic razors?

Cast iron is made from mixing iron ore with charcoal or coke (purified coal, close to pure carbon) and igniting it. With enough air the carbon burns hot enough to melt the iron. The oxygen in the iron oxides moves to the carbon to make CO2 and most impurities float to the top but a lot of carbon gets mixed into the final product. Wrought iron is similar but never fully melts. Impurities fall out and burn away as the metal is repeatedly re-shaped, i.e. worked or wrought.
