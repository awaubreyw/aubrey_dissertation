N95 mask are the gold standard of masks. COVID-19 viruses are 0.125 microns. \r<br>HOW MASKS WORK : A basic understanding of how masks work helps. Masks are filters. The material used in a\u00a0standard surgical mask\u00a0(by far the more common type of mask) reduces transmission of bacteria. Both bacteria and viruses are microscopic microbes, but they differ greatly. Bacteria are living cells, while a virus is a particle that requires a host cell to replicate. A coronavirus virion (particle) is spherical, averaging around 125 nanometers in diameter. Compare that to bacteria\u2019s 1,000-nm size. It\u2019s a grape compared to a grapefruit. A surgical mask whose purpose is to block bacteria will do little to prevent passage of the smaller coronavirus particle. \r<br>SHORTCOMINGS IN THE CURRENT DESIGNS Problematically, masks seem like they weren\u2019t designed for people\u2019s actual faces. What\u2019s more, tying the straps around your head might cause the mask to pucker at the cheeks, creating gaps; and gaps above the cheekbones result in an upward flow of breath that fogs glasses. Even just talking can make the mask creep down from the nose. Yawning does the same but more quickly. Biomechanically, face movement and mask movement don\u2019t align\u2014the jaw\u2019s pivot point is near the ear, while the mask flexes near the mouth.\r<br>In todays age people forgotten how to cover there cough and sneezes, however, a mask can not stop an airborne virus that goes right threw a standard mask , types of mask demonstrations only shows liquid particles in which they are affective, C-19 is airborne with a particle size 1000&#39;s times smaller and also the masks are not sealed tight, if your breathe can go threw so can the virus, for or against mask wearing you might want to learn that you eyes and ears can be entry points also, so for all you that like shaming/fear as a tactic, maybe you should set an example and just put a plastic bag over you entire head.\r<br>Proof masks don\u2019t work:\r<br>Mayo Clinic mask efficacy study video with smoke, and mask. \r<br>Particulate matter in wood smoke has a size range (0.4 \u2013 0.7micrometers). \r<br><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibm_ZuwNuRQ\">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibm_ZuwNuRQ</a>                                                                                                                    Dr uses vape clouds to illustrate how masks do not work\r<br><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=il-5HVmmMXE\">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=il-5HVmmMXE</a>", "comment_date": "2020-11-16T18:45:12Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Rex Christian Lim", "comment_text": "I mean, if we&#39;re all required to wear masks, then what&#39;s the point in testing?
