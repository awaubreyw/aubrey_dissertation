The amount of energy that the radio systems on a passenger airliner deal with easily drown out cell phone communications. If a single cell phone signal, if even an entire plane of worth of cell phone signals, could actually interfere with the avionics, the planes own navigational systems would interfere with each other. Simply put, the plain would not be able to fly it all.<br><br>This was actually disproven relatively recently. In fact, the origin of the issue actually comes from the federal communications commission.  The issue has to deal with the amount of connections a cell tower can maintain at a time. When you&#39;re driving around, you may normally be connected to two or three cell towers. Periodically, cell towers drop connections, in order to make room for new ones. So as you drive around town, you&#39;ll connect to a new tower and drop from another one. When you fly, moving at several hundred miles an hour, you can connect to multiple towers faster than the old ones can drop you. This ties up network band with, making it more difficult to make cell calls near an airport, even when there are antennas nearby. The issue is network congestion, nothing to do with safety.<br><br>As a former student naval aviator, if cell phones were this much of a problem, there would have been safety briefs about it. Not once in flight school did I ever hear a single instructor say anything about a cell phone. Because they don&#39;t actually matter.
