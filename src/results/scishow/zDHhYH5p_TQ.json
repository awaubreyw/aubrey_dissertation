There were electrophoretic creatures described as sand dollar like creatures that glowed as they built up charge, and they were stored in a large tank which was divided by a porus mesh of what the characters concluded was a conductive mateiral. On the other side of the mesh were animals that the sand dollars ate. The SDs had been modified or conditioned or both to press against the mesh and disharge in order to be allowed access to the food animals which were normally too large to fit through the the mesh which i think would adjust to allow access when it was being charged. <br> The SDs glow diminished as they discharged and ate. As they digested, their charge would build back up. Would be interesting to see if something like that is possible with eels of this nature. <br> Iirc the prey was incentivized to try to make it through the mesh by having their food on the SD side enough of them could get through and back that they could survive and the SDs eat during each cycle. <br> I realize that neither the ammount of energy nor the type is correct for typical human usage at the moment. But the species in the book was using this areangement only as a small part of their energy needs. They were nearly an entirely biological based technological species. They used very little hard technology that could be considered mechnical and inanimate in nature. For instance their need for light was supplied for the most part by organisms entirely designed and grown for that purpose. They could be assigned and deployed to areas or to specifici indiciduals as needed. So as long as you could feed these animals you had light. They had very little use directly for electricity so what they did need could be produced in this way.", "comment_date": "2021-04-27T18:38:24Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Amit das", "comment_text": "TY \ud83d\ude03", "comment_date": "2021-04-27T15:29:03Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "B", "comment_text": "for the algorithm", "comment_date": "2021-04-27T11:32:30Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Hunter Keplinger", "comment_text": "Title needs comma please", "comment_date": "2021-04-27T05:19:20Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Robyn Richards", "comment_text": "&quot;Those are the shrieking eels, princess.
