But I notice this in my dog (as well as a few other dogs I&#39;ve met), when I scratch an itch where I saw her scratching earlier she starts to not just kick, but also assumes the position she was in when she was scratching that spot, always the most awkward pose lol. And then her foot will start scratching my hand because it&#39;s in the way of that spot, but she&#39;s not just trying to do it herself, it&#39;s involuntary. It doesn&#39;t seem to be exclusive to any part of the body, just whatever is itchy at that moment on the dog. <br>So I guess what I mean is, maybe it&#39;s not parasite related or just a reflex from scratching certain nerves, but the actual scratching itself may be triggering some sort of repetitive kicking response in the muscles. This would rapidly and thoroughly scratch the itch without fine motor skills in the legs being required, stopping once the itchy signals have subsided/the itch has been scratched. If that were the case, it seems most dogs don&#39;t really mind the response. But some try to take over the scratching or become uncomfortable that they&#39;re feeling the scratchies but their foot isn&#39;t actually doing anything.
