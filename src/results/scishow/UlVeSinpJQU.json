Never been huge on sports... But just in life... Quite a few concussions. Back degenerative disc from factory work. Had a 6&quot; summer so sprains, sooo many. I work in house keeping so rotator cuff and carpal tunnel. Did gymnastics when I was little. I can say all of these repetitive injuries have caused chronic pain and stiffness. Aaaahhh track! Toe injuries! Yup. I&#39;m gonna die Aaaahhh! Seriously tho, physical jobs, especially being a lot lighter than most guy&#39;s who are 6&#39;1&quot; means I had to throw myself into lifting my end because I weighed 165#, while the other guy is 6&#39;0&quot; 220#. It makes a difference. Walking miles and miles on concrete floors. A lot of repetitive motion, and throw in random injuries like that 500# pallet fell of scale on your foot, or that chain did not keep that steel on the gooseneck and crushes both hands, and it arctic. Both cause and effect. Falling on 3&quot; lugs in a sawmill. Almost fell 30&#39; to steel decks below. That guy cut boards too short so you accidentally staple hand building a crate. I&#39;m really not accident prone. It&#39;s the jobs are that dangerous. So I went to housekeeping. My hands just open up, it&#39;s very physical, cardio, fast paced. But... Air conditioning is nice. Oh yeah heat exhaustion and fatigue. Did you say something about sports being dangerous?
