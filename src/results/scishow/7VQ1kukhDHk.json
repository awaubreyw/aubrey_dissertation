Perhaps if the water is hot enough it might kill some germs, but I can&#39;t confirm that.  It doesn&#39;t cure the illness, but it really helps reduce the symptoms for me.  Most people find the idea of drinking plain hot water kind of disgusting though, and refuse to do it.  Some will have to at least resort to adding tea &amp; honey or something to be palatable to them, but I go with just pure hot water (note I don&#39;t drink hot water from the tap/faucet, because hot water from the tap seems to bring some funkiness to the water).  I think hot chicken soup idea can act similarly, but obviously it can be more interesting to eat as it has a mild, and light richness (chicken fat oil), with slippery noodles that won&#39;t scratch the throat as it goes down.<br>Oh, the advantage of hot water over chicken soup IMO is that you can constantly drink hot water throughout the entire day, but it&#39;s not practical to eat chicken soup throughout the entire day.  I&#39;d either get full from chicken soup or I&#39;d get tired of eating chicken soup if I tried.  The constant flow of hot water over a gunky throat helps to keep your throat clear &amp; alleviated of pain for the entire day.
