Engineers and computer scientists taking inspiration from nature doesn&#39;t seem to fit well in an evolutionary paradigm, but it makes perfect sense in a creation model.  You wouldn&#39;t expect the selection of random mutations to make algorithms, but an intelligent supernatural Creator [God] would put those algorithms in there with no problem.  So why do you people pretend like this obvious sign of a Creator doesn&#39;t point to a Creator?  That&#39;s the flaw of methodological naturalism.
