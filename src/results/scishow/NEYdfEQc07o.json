It&#39;s also kind of why the light refracts blue when you look up the sky because it&#39;s full of water.

With such a small aperture setting, stars are not bright enough for the camera to capture them.  <br><br>Here on Earth, one could easily test this fact by taking a photo of a full moon with increasingly small aperture settings on the camera.
