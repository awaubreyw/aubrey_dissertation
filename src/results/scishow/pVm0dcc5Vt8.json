The seas aren&#39;t going to &quot;feed the masses&quot; as the spin version of the story goes.<br><br>Also according to the same foundation, fisheries that are &quot;regulated&quot; tend to be &quot;limited&quot; to extracting the absolute maximum the relevant ecosystem can produce, with no margin of safety built in. They&#39;re restricted to the very borderline between collapse and survival to some degree. If something goes wrong, &quot;regulated&quot; fisheries have a tendency to collapse.

There&#39;s plenty of time to do this, and it&#39;s obviously the best cause we could exist for.<br><br>So then why not begin educating ourselves in what this entails, in the details, by becoming so civilized that we stop eating the &quot;free stuff in the sea&quot; as if we were insects, and instead look after it, knowing its worth, as human beings. We could become human beings. When we&#39;re sucking the life out of the sea the way we do, we&#39;re not being human. We&#39;re not being what the Human Being could be, or should be.
