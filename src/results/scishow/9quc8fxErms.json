Rita Jafaar et al, that (even for covid) cycle values above 25 are wildly inaccurate, as they basically only amplify background noise.

PCR can in no way tell you if someone is sick or infectous.<br>Asymptomatic spread also doesn&#39;t make sense biologically.

This would seem to at least partially explain &quot;slow&quot; or &quot;long covid&quot;, though it might not be as direct as that in that many of those people might have even at the same time developed an autoimmune disorder anyway and since things are in such disarray at the moment thats not being considered. <br> Also along that same line, a hyper immune response doesnt necessarily mean that the immune system is universally hyper capable, to make a rather obscure reference, it could be the difference between superman or superboy and ultraboy, not to be confused with ultraman. But superman has all the well known powers and he can essientially use them for the sake of argument simultaneously and to an essientially unlimited magnitude. Hes superfast and can fly at those speeds, hes invulnerable even while running or flying at super speed. He has super strength which he can use without loosing invulnerability or speed and he can use his heat and xray vison again for the sake of argument seperately or along with all the other powers.  Ultraboy however has lets say all of those powers, but he can only use one of them at a time. <br> He can lift something heavy but in doing so he isnt invulnerable anymore or use his xray vision. <br> The immune system may be like that in hyper responsive people in that while it mounts a massive attack on a novel infection it cant respond to more typical infections that it is more familiar with.
