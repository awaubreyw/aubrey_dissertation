Although Beavers have very long and sharp teeth which are continually growing for as long as they live they are very picky about what they eat always. Unlike rats. Is that only because well a beaver would sure be hard to miss in an urban environment if it were to start waddling from one gully which dried up to a different body of water in a very large city with a wide river flowing through it when they would just have a way too inconvenient tail to be doing so anyway?", "comment_date": "2022-08-09T03:02:07Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "buh bird", "comment_text": "Study from the university of Georgia?
