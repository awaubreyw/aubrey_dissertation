The same reason most mammals are innately able to walk, run, jump, and otherwise control their bodies, and humans aren&#39;t. It isn&#39;t just swimming that we have to learn from scratch; it&#39;s all body movement. I don&#39;t understand why it&#39;s so shocking to learn that an animal that pops out of the womb able to immediately walk, can also immediately swim.<br><br>How do they know how to swim? The same way they know how to walk. It&#39;s very useful as a survival technique to be able to ambulate in a variety of environments, so there&#39;s a positive evolutionary pressure there toward ambulatory ability from birth.<br><br>Why do animals that don&#39;t normally live in or around water know how to swim? Well, I mean... because creationism isn&#39;t a thing? Nobody went out to design kangaroos and thought, &quot;Should I give them the power of swimming, or no?&quot; Kangaroos evolved from some slightly earlier ancestor that knew how to swim, which evolved from some earlier ancestor that knew how to swim, all the way back to creatures that always swam.<br><br>The real question isn&#39;t &quot;why are most mammals innately able to swim?&quot;; it&#39;s &quot;why aren&#39;t humans innately able to swim?&quot; And the answer to that is the same as the reason why humans aren&#39;t innately able to walk, or hold our heads aloft, or crawl, or accurately move our hands, or think our feet might be foreign objects at first: our brains are too big for our pelvic passages, so we have to come out too early. Basically, all humans are severely premature, by the standards of most mammals. We come out bizarrely hairless, underdeveloped, with squishy joints that haven&#39;t finished fully forming yet, and almost no innate knowledge or abilities.<br><br>And... emulate other animals to swim better? Seriously? We are not shaped like <i>any</i> other animal. Why would we swim like they do? Once we <i>do</i> learn to swim, we&#39;re actually quite good at it compared to most land mammals.
