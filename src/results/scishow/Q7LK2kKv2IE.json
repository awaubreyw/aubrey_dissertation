My Black Lab passed last year, and my Jack Russel didn\u2019t handle it well. When my JR saw her best friend laying on the floor she walked up like usual to give him a nudge to wake him up, when he didn\u2019t respond she looked at me(I was on the floor next to them, saying goodbye) and back at him a few times like she wanted me to wake him up. After a few seconds she started to nudge his nose with hers, getting faster and more forceful about it until she started doing it in a almost frantic manner, I saw the moment when she realized what was wrong and it was very clear and it broke my heart. When I tried to comfort her by petting her, she just laid down next him and wouldn\u2019t move, and gave out a low crying sound. When I tried moving her to get him ready to put in the truck(took him to be cremated), she refused to move and while I was sitting down next to them she just crawled into my lap and laid there. <br><br>There was a definite mourning period, the JR is one of the happiest dogs I\u2019ve known(my parents bred dogs while I was growing up so I\u2019ve known a lot of dogs, both ours and others) and she is always cheerful and playful. For about 2 weeks she didn\u2019t eat much, moved very slowly, wouldn\u2019t play with me or with any of her toys, etc. Losing my Lab was heartbreaking enough for me, but seeing how it affected the JR made it so much worse. Even after she got passed it, it seemed difficult for her, being the only dog in the house for the first time in her life, so I made the extra effort every day to give her more attention and more love. About 6 months later my moms Labradoodle had puppies and I couldn\u2019t pass up the chance to give my JR a friend, and finally after so long I get to see her at her happiest again. The labradoodle is now just 4 months old and while she can cross the line and play a bit too rough the JR seems to be in 7th heaven....", "comment_date": "2018-09-06T00:12:38Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Jh5578", "comment_text": "People fail to understand that animals can suffer too.

It was mostly cockatiels, with a few budgies and conures. One day while cleaning water dishes I noticed one of the cockatiels was laying on the floor, dead. Her name was Gracie. I knew something was going to happen, because Gracie was very close to another cockatiel in the rescue named Sarah, and they almost never split up. But that day Sarah had been sitting in a corner not doing much of anything. She refused to talk, or fly, any of her normal behaviors. After I found Gracie I told my manager and she came in and showed all the other cockatiels the body. They were a flock and you could tell this had an affect. The reactions were varied, some birds tried to wake her up, others started screaming and flying around, others still just sat there silent. Sarah was never the same. She was always sweet, but after Gracie died she became mean and violent towards people and other birds. It really goes to show just how intelligent and connected parrots can be.", "comment_date": "2017-11-07T23:05:02Z", "likes_count": 53}, {"comment_by": "Andru Bernardo", "comment_text": "RIP", "comment_date": "2017-11-07T22:58:33Z", "likes_count": 11}, {"comment_by": "Singularity", "comment_text": "Why do some animals find holes to hide in when they are about to die?", "comment_date": "2017-11-07T22:57:15Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Eddie", "comment_text": "What kind of video is this, everyone knows animals mourn death....", "comment_date": "2017-11-07T22:56:08Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Beau B", "comment_text": "Im an animal, and i do", "comment_date": "2017-11-07T22:54:45Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Wyrmhand", "comment_text": "<a href=\"https://youtu.be/ixSzhbAMvgQ\">https://youtu.be/ixSzhbAMvgQ</a>", "comment_date": "2017-11-07T22:54:28Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Viewer617", "comment_text": "Yes they do.
