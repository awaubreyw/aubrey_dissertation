The darwinists wants you to believe that an organism popped into existence with the ability to find and digest food.<br><br>But consider the components that have to be in place in your own body in order for that to happen.<br><br>Eyes to find and identify the food.<br><br>Nose and taste buds to identify the quality of the food. If you didn&#39;t have taste buds you would die from food poisoning. When was the last time you spit something out that tasted rotten.<br><br>Bones and muscular structure to move yourself towards the food.<br><br>A month that is designed to intake food and only food and not other matter.<br><br>A brain to identify the food.<br><br>The digestive system to transform the food into energy. Which is made up of many complex parts just on its own.<br><br>An anus to excrete the food waste or you&#39;ll explode from food waste buildup.<br><br>Liver and kidneys.<br>To filter the natural toxic build up inherent to all food.<br><br>And last but not least, Food itself.<br>Which only comes from the food chain and organisms that would have to already exist. Or you could be born into existence with the ability to manufacture your own food which is called photosynthesis. An extremely complex multi-step process. Which is just as complicated as digestion.<br><br>And requires the intake of oxygen and water. So it&#39;s really just the ability to eat CO2, water, and sunlight. Darwinism wants you to believe that an organism popped into existence with all of these features.<br><br>Single cellular organisms do not have eyes, mouths, or muscular structure. Actually they do, they just go by different names like... Membrane, Chemical receptor, Mitochondria,\u00a0 Endoplasmic reticulum. <br><br>Single cellular organisms have all the same basic parts that we do we just call them by different names. And if a single cellular organism existed without every single one of them it would immediately die. Evolution is impossible.<br><br>Isn&#39;t this good news.<br><br>An intelligent Creator is the only logical alternative.<br>A painting cannot paint itself.<br>The building is proof of the builder.<br>Creation is proof of the creator.", "comment_date": "2021-11-15T03:01:53Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "bob dobbs", "comment_text": "Gotta love evo people.
