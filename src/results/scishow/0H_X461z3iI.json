Figured I&#39;d repost my thoughts in a fresh thread.<br><br>\u200bThe TL;DR is that both smoking or holding your breath would not make you get drunk faster because your body compensates, but it might be possible with some forms of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). The details are below:<br>\r<br>In short-term smokers with healthy lung tissue--and we&#39;re talking about individuals who have been smoking consistently for less than several months--we&#39;d be stating that, hypothetically, cigarette smoking is similar to holding your breath. Although this is true if you neglect the effects of nicotine and CO, you&#39;ll notice that holding your breath for some duration results in a marked increase in depth and rate of respiration once you start breathing again. This is also the case with cigarettes: people need to breath more between drags of their cigarettes than they would have to if they weren&#39;t smoking. However, periods of increased respiration between drags are balanced with periods of decreased respiration during drags and there is basically no net hyperventilation over time. Blood-ethanol levels would likely be similar over time in short-term smoking individuals versus non-smoking individuals.<br>\r<br>As an aside, the increased need to respire between drags might not be so noticeable due to nicotine&#39;s stimulating effects on vasoconstriction and heart rate, which could increase the efficiency of gas exchange. In this context, however, ventilatory effort is much more important for gas exchange than perfusion of blood in the lungs, and this is for reasons that are beyond the scope of the point I&#39;m making. I would guess that the activating effects of nicotine on the central nervous system give some people the impression that they are more sober than they really are. I don&#39;t know if this latter point is true, but that would be an avenue to investigate and I would assume that literature on it exists.<br>\r<br>Smoking for months or even as little as a year can lead to irreversible changes to the tissues of your lungs, which causes a decreased ability to exchange gasses (for more reading: <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4516194/\">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4516194/</a> ). Hypothetically, in some habitually-smoking people, alcohol could be retained for longer due to the damage that their lungs have sustained. Alas, the body would still be sensitive to the decreased ability to absorb O2 or exhale CO2, and, as a result, induce an increase in the respiratory rate. In this case, I would think that the ethanol retained due to the inability to exchange gas would be lost due to the increased respiratory rate.<br>\r<br>Many individuals that smoke develop what&#39;s called COPD, which, although preventable (by quitting) and treatable (with lots of meds), is irreversible, worsens over time, and variable in its presentation and resultant effects on ventilatory drive. Classically, individuals diagnosed with COPD fall into two categories: those who breath relatively faster and more shallow due to decreased ability to exchange gas (similar to what was mentioned in the previous paragraph), which is associated more with emphysema, and those who breath relatively more *slowly due to outflow obstruction that causes the lungs to be overinflated, which is associated with chronic bronchitis. Often times, the presentation can be mixed, so it&#39;s just a stereotypical way to characterize things, but the point here is that respiratory rate can be *decreased in some individuals with COPD. For these individuals, it might be possible that they&#39;d retain more ethanol in their blood for longer. It&#39;s basically like they&#39;re somewhat holding their breath for the rest of their lives--pretty horrific to witness and surprisingly common.\r<br><br>\r<br>Thanks for giving me an excuse to think about pulmonology and procrastinating what I&#39;m actually supposed to be studying! Check out any pulmonary physiology/pathology review if you want a source for most of what I wrote.<br>\r<br>PSA: although COPD and atherosclerosis are irreversible and cancer is often deadly, risk and severity tend to get worse with the amount of time one smokes. Quality and duration of life improve dramatically with quitting.

A darker and richer beer will require something equally hearty like a thick burger patty on a potato bun with a side of fries. Wine requires a full meal with 2 sides and an entree.
