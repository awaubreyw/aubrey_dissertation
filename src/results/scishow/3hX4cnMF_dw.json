That sounds like a ridiculous reason.  So here is my uneducated guess:<br><br>Step 1 - Start with a small animal ( T-Rex ancestor ) that needs to reach up high AND move fast, for whatever reason.  There are 3 ways that an animal can reach up high - long arms, long neck, or standing on hind legs.  Of the 3 options, standing on hind legs develops joints and muscles that allow for bipedal running, which is fast.  Animals that have long necks are not fast, and animals that have long arms are not fast unless fully bipedal like humans.<br><br>Step 2 - As a partial quadruped, it becomes easier to balance on hind legs if the animal has a longer and heavier tail.<br><br>Step 3 - Thousands or millions of years go by and the animal gains lots of mass for whatever reason.  ( The small ancestor evolves into a larger and larger animal )<br><br>Step 4 - Given a large tail, large body, and bipedal motion, excessive forward mass becomes a problem.<br><br>Step 5 - An evolutionary tradeoff emerges - The animal can either have a larger head and smaller arms, or larger arms and smaller head, in order to balance the forward body mass with the rear tail for efficient bipedal locomotion. <br><br>Step 6 - Animals that evolve larger heads and smaller arms can have larger jaws which makes them more formidable while fighting with peers, and they can kill larger prey.<br><br>So my personal conclusion is that a huge bipedal animal with small arms can maintain balance with a larger head.
