By having a bunch of self-driving cars moving at exactly the same speed with many car lengths between them on a grid is a good solution. Place 1 to 3 self-driving designated lanes on the far side of exits on every highway (almost like an HOV lane), then place 1 to 3 lanes where people are free to drive without a computer at the wheel on the side of the highway with the exits. When drivers want to disengage out of the self driving grid or get back into it, they can toggle between the 2 options and their car will find a place on the grid that became vacant or vacate a spot on the grid to drive off of the highway or drive however they like. The obvious problem is that there aren&#39;t that many self driving cars out there, but they do exist and could be very safe if they learned to space themselves and interact with one another to avoid collision in the event of a near accident. Plus it leaves room for people who want to be the entity piloting their vehicle because they like the freedom of driving.

Ending the extra lanes several miles later could help. Another issue is having way too many exit and on ramps in cities. Of course if you were to add express lanes with no on/exit ramps, with EMERGENCY access points every 2-5 miles, either through or just around the city for truck drivers and others who are just driving through it would drastically reduce the number of unnecessary vehicles in that traffic jam. <br><br>Some of the states just don&#39;t understand that express lanes were initially intended to help thru traffic get thru without interrupting local traffic. Giving people access ramps to and from express lanes for every exit and off ramps of the main interstate is just adding more lanes to the existing interstate. It causes more bottle necks and more chances of someone causing an accident trying to cross six lanes of traffic in a quarter of a mile.

The best reason for traffic can actually be linked to bad parking policies. As he mentioned in the video, people will take the choice that costs them the least amount in time and money and that&#39;s absolutely true not with just route choice but also mode choice. When cities require parking for businesses it makes the cost of driving much less than other modes such as bicycle or transit and virtually guarantees less dense land uses which deter bicycling and walking. If you remove strict parking policies, you can have very dense development that is walkable bike-able and is easier to be served by transit. Since most people in their car are traveling with themselves and perhaps a bag, driving is an incredibly inefficient mode of travel but is virtually required because of the aforementioned parking policies. In addition, free parking isn&#39;t free and must be paid for by someone. The free parking at the grocery store is partially subsidized by the food cost. If you arrived by transit, bike or walk you are paying for a utility (a parking space) that you aren&#39;t using, but since it&#39;s usually a bundled cost (except in rare pay garages), those people don&#39;t have a choice. 2ndly, He&#39;s absolutely right about the induced demand effect and I wish he would have expanded that to other modes. If you build a great bike network, more people bike, if you build better transit, more people take transit and of course if you build more highways more people use them.  3rdly and incredibly important is that there is no such thing as &#39;accidents&#39;.

Humans CAN NOT take over. As scary as everyone seems to think this is, it IS the solution. Drivers are rude and selfish. They don&#39;t work together and are vindictive. A central traffic coordinator that all the cars obey or at least the cars can communicate and figure it out together. But it is important that the decision is made by an impartial computer, and the drivers have no input to interject their selfishness. People are bad about not obeying traffic laws. One thing mentioned in the video as a solution and I saw some commenters correctly commenting about is leaving more distance between yourself and the car in front of you. People will jump in front of you every time, then you have to slow down to make the space between you and THAT car, then another car jumps in between you and THAT car. And so on and so on. A reminder: Right turn on red is if there is no one coming, not so you can squeeze into traffic. If you can see someone coming, DON&#39;T TURN! You have no right to turn. You will get a green light on your side soon enough. And if there isn&#39;t space on the other side of the intersection, it is illegal to move into the intersection, that includes right turns. Self driving cars could much more easily execute a zipper merge. There would also be absolutely no need for traffic lights.  It would calculate at every intersection you will encounter how to get through so that no one ever has to stop. Reducing one car&#39;s speed, while increasing another car&#39;s speed. And it would have calculated all of this before you even started the trip.

Next in my mind, if it does boil down to waiting, analyze the turmoil- and find in your mind adequate justification without bending the plausible truth unto yourself, this I find helpful because there is no way to say things will go your, or my way~ so it grants crucial positivity amid turmoil. Lastly, though the second is a spin of the first patience is fundamentally the only way to become fully considerate, and to learn, and to make sense of all that is around you~ it likely will always be more complicated than your first impression so take second and third impressions lest you really think one chance defines having good patience.

Since, as Hank said, the time it takes to get up to speed balances out whether you were close and had to wait to accelerate or back a ways and started moving right away, there is no benefit to leaving an overabundance of space when stopped. <br>Obviously I am not advocating touching bumpers, and when on a hill or behind a stick shift a little more space is needed, but leaving as little space as is safe to leave in these situations is beneficial for everyone.", "comment_date": "2018-06-24T15:00:07Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Jerry Lin", "comment_text": "@<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=epHRVoTFuVM&amp;t=6m40s\">6:40</a> leave more space and the another aggressive driver cut in front you creating a new traffic wave....", "comment_date": "2018-06-24T02:36:37Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "S\u00e9rgio D.

This also keeps someone from feeling pressured to speed up.  I have noticed that certain states have more or less traffic jams on the highway.  The most striking example is North and South Carolina.  North Carolina has much worse traffic issues than South Carolina.  This is due to one, police monitoring speeders way more.  Anything that is 10 over will get you pulled over.  Now.  This causes some asshats to just sit in the left lane and go 70 mph....  and not MOVE.  However in South Carolina you can BLOW past a cop and they don&#39;t really care all too much.  The people on highways will actually move out of the left lane, and traffic moves on average a solid 10 mph faster on highways (and most roads).  This mean less traffic due to people getting to where they need to be faster.  The faster they get somewhere, the faster they are off the road.  Now there are speed trap county&#39;s in every state, so keep that in mind.  Everywhere is different when it comes to driving, but realize that there will always be aggressive drivers.

If businesses that deal overseas switch some or all of their employees to overnight schedules, and more businesses varied their hours throughout the day, such as evening schedules, there would be no rush hour at all, and our current roads would have more than enough lanes for decades without expansions, saving cities millions of dollars.  Also, the increased energy use from businesses being active at night would be more than offset by the massive drop in emissions and gas usage from people who are no longer sitting in traffic (which by some estimates generates 20-40% of vehicle emissions overall).  Service businesses probably wouldn&#39;t even need to change their hours, since they&#39;re typically open til 10pm or later, but they could also spread their staff more evenly throughout the day.

In the UK we have been a guinea pig for these experiments and as such have had to suffer various guises of a managed motorway network which is heavily controlled and regulated and claims to reduce driving times by smoothing out the flow of traffic by operating heavily enforced variable speed limits.<br><br>So what is the problem; why does it not work when science says it should?

The problem arises in an enforced regime when drivers become frustrated by what they perceive as unnecessary restrictions.<br><br>Now perhaps the most flawed example in this video is the bag of rocks; not that it is flawed in its explanation, but it is flawed in being cited as an example of why we should not make roads bigger and wider. In essence it is all about scale.  Allow me to go back to my water example which is far more analogous to road traffic than a bag of rocks.  Now if you pour water into a funnel then it will slow down, but will not get jammed in the entrance of the funnel; this is because the molecules of the water are small enough and the funnel is large enough to guarantee flow (unless you have a really tiny funnel).  The point being that once you make the road wide enough you will reach a point where you do indeed guarantee flow.<br><br>The problem of a wave is very real but, certainly in Europe, this is caused by speed restricted vehicles such as heavy goods vehicles being able to use the second lane of motorways when they are artificially restricted to the extent that they cannot travel over 56MPH.<br><br>One of the biggest problems that science has in solving the problem is that the problems for long haul and short haul are very different and if the two were separated then it would make life much easier for both.  The biggest reason for motorways to become clogged is actual vehicles entering and leaving the motorway (and no amount of active traffic management can do anything about this).  One solution is to physically divide the motorway so that a 4 lane motorway could have a couple of long haul lanes and 2 short haul lanes.  The long hauls should be physically impossible to exit for around 5 junctions in order to maintain higher speeds which will get vehicles to where they want to be much faster (the faster vehicle go the quicker that they are off the road, which provides a real world increase in overall road capacity).  An alternative short term solution would be to block off every other slip road, although this would have a significantly adverse effect on other parts of the road network.<br><br>Short haul is a much more difficult problem to solve but in towns and cities making all roads one way and opening up the majority of side roads in order to allow drivers to take a more direct route to their destination would go some way towards alleviating the problem.  The problem here is that we need to convince people that they need to accept free flowing traffic going down their side street and that it is not a good idea to let their children and pets play in the road (which lets be honest, it isn&#39;t at any speed and flow of traffic).<br><br>Automated cars will solve some of the problems, but I think that it is more likely that automated drones will be the real solution (perhaps in 50 or so years time).", "comment_date": "2018-04-07T16:06:06Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "AndroidDoctorr", "comment_text": "I really love it when someone slams on the gas to pass me only for me to slowly pass them later without even trying just because of lane traffic.

At this point, it becomes a cascading domino effect of people going in front of you, and you continue to go slower. You might as well just go into the far right lane at granny speed. If I&#39;m not in a rush, I will just go to the far right lane and let people pass me if they want. But that&#39;s why the problem exists; Traffic time aka too many cars in the same place at once. Everyone is trying to go somewhere at the same time, so just adding bigger gaps isn&#39;t going to fix it. Honestly, I think the issue is more of the time schedule. Everyone is trying to get to or leave the same area at the same time. If stores and businesses ran more 24-7 with worker having a staggered schedule, we wouldn&#39;t have these traffic hours at certain times of the day.

If you wait til the merge starts before you start merging at highway speeds and length of merge it will be too late and once the lane ending start breaking and slowing down as panic sets in the &#39;speed differential&#39; increases and THAT is where it gets bad... vehicles moving at similar speeds can merge much more efficiently, so everyone merging a mile ahead of time is too soon but as the merge starts is too late.  In my opinion, the best is somewhere in the middle with the goal being to have completed the lane change before the merge (when I say the merge , i mean where the striping or cones or barrels start forcing the ending lane closed), while both lanes are moving at similar speeds, once breaking starts and speed differential becomes a factor and it falls apart.  Now if you want to discuss when to start merging 1000ft before merge starts, 1/4 or 1/2 mile, speed and volume should be considered but key element would communicate how to best merge with psa and signage.  One thing some may not consider is that larger heavier vehicles work trucks, landscaping truck trailers, on up to dump trucks and 18 wheelers need to merge sooner because it is harder to find a large enough spot at the last minute and once a loaded 18 wheeler gets on the brakes or  wose stopped, both lanes will almost certainly have to nearly stop to get the merge working again, so if you instruct people to wait till the merge.  And to expect someone who merged earlier when it was smother to sit and watch cars behind them jump out and go buzzing down the ending lane to jump back and cause the thru lane to stop to allow them in, is a hard sell.  I think it would worth a try to set a merge zone, established with signage, after the initial warning lane ends 1 mile at 1000ft or 1/4 mile before the actual merge that this is best time to blend in at no more traffic should enter the ending lane beyond that point &quot;Merge NOW lane ends 1000ft.
