Specifically when the concentration of the anaesthetic molecules reaches a concentration in brain lipids of 0.05 molal, general anaesthesia ensues. Could this transition be due to the effect of this concentration upon electron mobility in the tubulin dimers? Say in triggering a switch of the tubulin electron currents from quantum to classical - kind of like unplugging the dimer electrons from interaction with quantum vacuum electromagnetic field fluctuations? You know, like switching the brain&#39;s computation from networked to offline computation? \ud83e\udd14", "comment_date": "2022-07-02T12:20:57Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Abstract", "comment_text": "<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZSsYjQeK0qg&amp;t=2m54s\">2:54</a> &quot;We&#39;re still not sure why this mechanism exists.

There are 4 stages through which a patient must go to effect the state of unconsciousness that is required for any surgery to happen. 1) sedation-- pt is essentially &quot;awake&quot;, and can respond purposefully to verbal commands; 2) the excitatory phase-- prior to fully losing consciousness, the patient manifests a period of paradoxical &quot;hyperactivity&quot; during which s/he might experience involuntary movements that give the APPEARANCE of wakefulness-<del>yet  the patient cannot respond purposefully to verbal stimuli; 3) general anesthesia-</del> the patient is at a level of unconsciousness such that s/he will not respond to ANY type of stimulus, particularly a painful one,  such as a skin incision; 4) overdose-- this stage of anesthesia is not part of a standard (or even nonstandard) general anesthetic; it is achieved when the concentration of delivered anesthetic gases begins to induce potentially harmful effects (most often decreased blood pressure). <br>Be mindful that NONE of these stages of general anesthesia include rapid eye movements, or any condition which could mimic REM sleep; additionally, there is no evidence of any neurological/physiological restorative function afforded by general anesthesia. So, it bears repeating: GENERAL ANESTHESIA IS NOT NATURAL SLEEP. PATIENTS ARE NOT NAPPING. PATIENTS ARE NOT LIKELY TO EXPERIENCE DREAMS (although they may). PATIENTS ARE NOT BEING SENT ON A  LOVELY VACATION. PATIENTS ARE NOT GETTING A &quot;NICE COCKTAIL.&quot; Even this video gives only the little declarative evidence gathered to date regarding the mechanism of general anesthesia at the molecular level.

He explained that when he closed his eyes, it was just black to him. There was no thoughts or emotions or whatever. <br><br>So he explained that even when he slept, he coul enter a state very similar to this, so that he could actually remain consciously aware even when he was in dreamless sleep. So he went on to explain that even when you are asleep, or knocked out, or even put under, you are still conscious, but the reason that you don&#39;t feel pain is because you don&#39;t create memories.

So can you tell us if this discovery has led to anything that is helping to make anethesia safer? Is it not true that anesthesiology is its own feild because if you get it wrong you can absolutely kill someone? Is it not true that even if you are an anesthesiologist whos made this kind of thing your live&#39;s work - sometimes there are people who just die due to the anesthesia itself and nobody really knows why that happens either? <br><br>I&#39;ve heard that it actually happens alot more often than people realize, and it is one of the primary reasons you are still required to sign a form that basically legally absolves the anesthesiologist of first degree murder and keeps your family from suing the hospital - and that form is just for the anesthesia alone not even the surgery itself. Anethesia is actually still to this day- alot less safe than people think it is. Certainly nobody could say outright that it is &quot; perfectly harmless&quot;. Knowing what it&#39;s doing is cool I guess but more importantly - can this discovery help keep anesthesiologiest from killing people on accident before they even do the surgery? <br><br>Isn&#39;t like- the very first step to every surgery - that the anesthesiologist comes in- they put the person under- and then the doctors have to wait to make sure the patient isn&#39;t already dieing due to the anesthesia itself before they can even begin operating? Isn&#39;t that like the standard procedure? Why is that not being mentioned here at all?  It seems like the true relevance to a general populace of this discovery is whether or not this new knowledge is leading toward helping anesthesiologists understand why some people die right away just because they were put under anesthesia at all- long before a doctor with a scalpal ever gets near them. I think you&#39;ll find with any doctor that they will tell you outright &quot; there is always some risk of near instant death&quot;  with general anesthesia. That&#39;s why if they believe that they can do the surgery on you by using local site injection numbing instead of putting you under- they will always reccomend you do that instead. Not to mention all the weird things that happen to people under anesthesia that nobody completely understadtands yet. For example- the people who wake up part way through surgery paralyzed but very much concious and able to feel everything.
