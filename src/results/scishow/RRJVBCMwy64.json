Then once we hit Mars, we got one blizzard after the other. The snow came and melted away about 4-5 times over a single month.<br><br>Two weeks into April and it&#39;s 25 degrees celcius. This continues pretty much through May all the way till June the 10th, cause today (June the 11th) it&#39;s been around 9 degrees all day and will continue to do so for a while. Hopefully it gets warm again, but being a Dane, I wont bet on it. Literally anything can happen. Living here means getting up in the morning, preparing yourself for everything, since the day can literally start out being 22 degrees celcius and then suddenly drop to around 10 degrees in a matter of 20-30 minutes.<br><br>And then it still might only be in that particular area.
