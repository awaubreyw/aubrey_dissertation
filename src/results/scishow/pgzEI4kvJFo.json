Since you can feed it every file of 256 bits (would take longer than the universe has existed) and bigger files (all files) as well, by the pigeon-hole-principle, anyone can see that AES-256 hash MUST have collisions. The most beloved new data-structure in modern computer programming languages is the dictionary/hash. All of the implementations I know of, the end pointer of a hash leads to a linked-list (almost always consisting of one element).

They are wanting to move forward, as quickly as they can, as soon as they can. They also don&#39;t want to hit the person in front of them hard, don&#39;t want to be disqualified (or break social norms) by pushing their way around, through, or over other runners, and don&#39;t want to fall to the ground and be trampled. Equations and fluid dynamics aren&#39;t needed to predict what will happen, as row two has to wait for row one to move and then react, row three has to wait for row one to move and row two to react and then react themselves, row four has to wait for row one to move, row two to react then move, row three to react to row two, then react and move themselves, and so on. The further back you go the longer it will take for the runner&#39;s wishes to move forward to be realized with their other wants being met ( being fair, not hurt, etc).  This would, and does happen,  regardless if the start had a funnelling aspect to it or not, it just adds time for the whole process to be completed and adds an element of confusion in the minds of the runners as to how best to meet their contradicting goals (go fast vs don&#39;t die), again adding more time.
