In that case the mechanism of spread of the disease seems to have been totally misunderstood.<br><br><br>Something similar might also be happening with Covid-19. There are at least two possible confounding factors. One was suggested by a small US study looking for antibodies which, while questionable in its design, suggests that the number of people who have contracted the infection may exceed the reported number by a factor of 50-85 times.  If correct, this would indicate that the overwhelming majority of Covid-19 infections are mild and that it is far more infectious than present figures suggest. A second factor is the evident genetic instability of this virus. Multiple mutations have already be observed and a study in Iceland which sampled 5% of the population found 40 variants.<br><br><br>Given that a successful virus spreads as much as possible, selection pressure favours less harmful viruses with higher infectivity. This is thought to be what happened in the case of the first SARS coronavirus: it mutated away from pathogenicity and took itself out of the equation as a serious pathogen. The high rate of mutations might also point to why some areas are seeing different characteristics of the infection. Here&#39;s hoping!

Quick question. As I understand it, this virus will continue to spread until either:<br><br>(1) we hit sufficient herd immunity to drop Ro below 1.0, at which point the virus will start to decline, or <br><br>(2) we develop a vaccine.<br><br>It seems like experts predominantly agree that option 1 will happen before option 2. If this is true, then the number of total infected individuals will be about the same regardless of what measures we take.

The latter is what experts mean when they say \u201cflatten the curve.\u201d If we want to avoid deaths, we should:<br><br>(1) keep infections below the level that would overwhelm hospitals, and <br><br>(2) try to keep susceptible people from getting sick.<br><br>If this is true, wouldn\u2019t the best solution be to allow non-susceptible people to interact as much as possible as long as we stay below an amount that would overwhelm hospitals? It seems like many governments are trying to distance far beyond this point - unless they\u2019re willing to do so for over a year for a vaccine, I think this will end up killing more people in the long run. By having overly-extensive distancing, you force non-susceptible people to behave like susceptible people, which gives them a roughly equal chance to contract the disease. If you loosen restrictions, non-susceptible can be less careful and take up more of the necessary infections.<br><br>Just curious as to your thoughts.

Alternate models include SEIR(susceptible, exposed, infected, recovered) and SEYAR(susceptible, exposed, symptomatic, asymptomatic and recovered). These can more accurately model the outbreak, and get a better estimate of R-o. Unfortunately, with these more robust models, it&#39;s looking like this disease is about as bad as it can get. Some newer models are showing that the R-o of COVID-19 is closer to that of Measles. Measles is the most infectious disease we know of, with an R-o of 12-18. I saw one model that puts COVID-19 R-o at a median of 14.
