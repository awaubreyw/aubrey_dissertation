Long exposures of stars generally turn into streaks or blobs if the exposure is too slow. Too fast and it won&#39;t get enough light to produce an image. If you want to do long exposure photography of stars from Earth you need the camera to move with the stars to prevent the streaks, and if the camera wobbles even a little the entire thing can come out blurry. I know, the mountains in the back move slower than things that are close, but still. Everything is in space moving around really fast, and the exposure time of the first JWST images took around 19 hours... I&#39;m guessing they probably used the typical astrophotography method of image stacking, and it was probably more like &quot;equivalent to 19 hours&quot; and they just took like 3000 images with 32s exposures and stacked them, while everything moves around really fast, and also in space where things are a bit different than on Earth. I may have come up with the solution to my own issue. It&#39;s still mind boggling though. I guess 19 hours doesn&#39;t make much difference to light that&#39;s 13.5 billion years old. Kind of weird that we can even see that light still. It&#39;s probably the closest thing we&#39;ll have to time travel; being able to see the light from objects that aren&#39;t there anymore. If the Milky Way is swirling and the Earth is just a rock zooming around space then I wonder if we could look back at where Earth used to be 13 million years ago to see what it was like back then.
