The result of going back and forth to work everyday built up pollution in the environment and caused for all kinds of natural disasters and deadly diseases to come and destroy lives. The Lord God commanded His people Israel and children of Zion to only stay at home. Men have to only farm natural food; Abundance of natural food leads to healthy life and gives strength to resist deadly diseases. Women must stay home, cook healthy meals for their families, and teach their children to obey the laws and commandments of God. This will stop social problems and decrease government expenditures. Children are supposed to only enjoy childhood life and not to be overwhelmed with school works and loan payments with interest. Governments must not burden the public with national debts and taxes.  Employers need to love their employees by having them work only three days a week; Well rested workers make the country strong. All inhabitants of the earth and farm lands need to take rest every Sabbath Day and Sabbatical Year to renew their strength for the following years to come. And all nations need to forgive each others&#39;s debts; Greed and selfishness cause hard work, sicknesses, and sufferings on earth.  Remember that every country is chained together as a necklace. If one breaks, everyone will suffer.  <br><br>We are in the process of building the beloved City of the Lord Jesus called Mount Zion, the Heavenly Jerusalem, with a temple in it. The mission of it on earth is to teach the people about the importance of obedience to the Law of Moses which is the righteousness and holiness of God. It is the highest knowledge in the world because it will only result peace, prosperity, good health, and life without death. Disobedience towards the laws and commandments of God brings a curse as natural disasters, famine, war, and deadly diseases. I am asking everyone in the world to donate from the heart for the building of Mount Zion which is called the joy of the earth. If you want to donate, please contact Us.

When the people ignore or reject it, the  Lord God comes with punishments until the people learn to obey them. <br><br>If you want peace, good health, and life on earth, all governments, public, and businesses need to come back to the way of life in the past which the Lord God commanded to the children of Israel and people in Zion to live by. The result of going back and forth to work everyday built up pollution in the environment and caused for all kinds of natural disasters and deadly diseases to come and destroy lives. The Lord God commanded His people Israel and children of Zion to only stay at home. Men have to only farm natural food; Abundance of natural food leads to healthy life and gives strength to resist deadly diseases. Women must stay home, cook healthy meals for their families, and teach their children to obey the laws and commandments of God. This will stop social problems and decrease government expenditures. Children are supposed to only enjoy childhood life and not to be overwhelmed with school works and loan payments with interest. Governments must not burden the public with national debts and taxes.  Employers need to love their employees by having them work only three days a week; Well rested workers make the country strong. All inhabitants of the earth and farm lands need to take rest every Sabbath Day and Sabbatical Year to renew their strength for the following years to come. And all nations need to forgive each others&#39;s debts; Greed and selfishness cause hard work, sicknesses, and sufferings on earth.  Remember that every country is chained together as a necklace. If one breaks, everyone will suffer.  <br><br>We are in the process of building the beloved City of the Lord Jesus called Mount Zion, the Heavenly Jerusalem, with a temple in it. The mission of it on earth is to teach the people about the importance of obedience to the Law of Moses which is the righteousness and holiness of God. It is the highest knowledge in the world because it will only result peace, prosperity, good health, and life without death. Disobedience towards the laws and commandments of God brings a curse as natural disasters, famine, war, and deadly diseases. I am asking everyone in the world to donate from the heart for the building of Mount Zion which is called the joy of the earth. If you want to donate, please contact Us. May the Lord Jesus who sent me, His angel, in this last day be merciful to you by forgiving you and to heal you.<br><br>Isaiah 63:9<br>In all their affliction He was afflicted, and the Angel of His Presence saved them; In His love and in His pity He redeemed them; And He bore them and carried them all the days of old.<br><br>Obadiah <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wfPF6_KRR_U&amp;t=1m17s\">1:17</a><br>But on Mount Zion there shall be deliverance, and there shall be holiness; The house of Jacob shall possess their possessions.<br><br>The Spirit and the bride,<br>Mount Zion, Heavenly Jerusalem<br>Gabriel riah", "comment_date": "2020-04-19T21:14:09Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "James Mitchell", "comment_text": "Not as bad as the flu huh?", "comment_date": "2020-04-18T16:18:29Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "James Mitchell", "comment_text": "<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wfPF6_KRR_U&amp;t=4m55s\">4:55</a> no, it\u2019s not!", "comment_date": "2020-04-18T16:17:19Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Justin", "comment_text": "Hank, this message is from the future.

Which means by that point it was water cooler gossip and the entire hospital knew about it. Few medical workers talked about it, all the rest kept quiet. For good reason, the ones that talked were picked up by security apparatus. Until January 20 Chinese authorities kept insisting there was no human-to-human transmission, though for sure they knew there was already in December.<br>The significance of R0 is that higher it is the harder it is to stop an epidemic. For example, in case of R0=2, if you can prevent more than half the infections the numbers of new cases will keep dropping until the epidemic dies out. If R0=4 you need to prevent more than 75% of new infections to achieve the same result which is much harder. For something like measles with R0 somewhere between 12-18, your only option is to immunize almost the entire population. Something you can&#39;t do with a virus you have no vaccine for.<br>Completely separate from spread of the epidemic is the severity of the disease. You can calculate mortality rate two ways, dead/cases and you get 2.18% right now. Or you can calculate dead/(dead+recovered) and you get 23.4% right now. As time passes these figures approach each other and you get a figure you can take a bit more seriously.

Several countries in the Middle East have been affected, including Jordan, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates (UAE), and Qatar. Cases have also been reported by three countries in Europe: France, Germany, and the United Kingdom. All of the European cases have had a direct or indirect connection to the Middle East. However, in France and the United Kingdom, there has been limited local transmission among close contacts who had not been to the Middle East but had been in contact with a traveler recently returned from the Middle East.<br><br>The most recent case reported had onset on 10 May 2013. Most patients are male (79%; 31 of 39 cases with sex reported), and range in age from 24 to 94 years (median 56 years). All of the laboratory confirmed cases had respiratory disease as part of the illness, and most had severe acute respiratory disease requiring hospitalization. Reported clinical features include acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), renal failure requiring hemodialysis, consumptive coagulopathy, and pericarditis. Many patients have also had gastrointestinal symptoms including diarrhea during the course of their illness. One patient, who was immunocompromised, presented with fever, diarrhea and abdominal pain, but had no respiratory symptoms initially; pneumonia was identified incidentally on a radiograph. 20 of the 40 patients have died.<br><br>Since 6 April 2013, 21 cases of infection have been confirmed and reported in the region of Al-Ahsa in the Eastern Province of Saudi Arabia (16 males and 5 females, median age 56 years). Nine of these have died, and six remain critically ill. Most patients were reported to have at least one comorbidity. The majority of the initial cases were associated with a single health care facility in Al-Ahsa. Additional cases have subsequently been identified who were not patients at the facility. Three family members of cases linked to the facility and two health care workers not associated with the Al-Ahsa facility but who had contact with laboratory confirmed cases have become infected. Two additional cases have been identified in the community that did not have any links with other cases from the Al-Ahsa healthcare facility. Although investigations are still ongoing into the source of this outbreak, early information indicated that only a small minority of these cases had contact with animals in the time leading up to their illness.<br><br>Since 8 May 2013, two cases have been reported by France. The first case became ill after a 9 day vacation to Dubai, UAE. The second case, reported on 12 May, is a patient who shared a room at a health care facility with the first case. Investigations to look for additional cases among fellow travelers of the first case and close contacts of both cases are currently underway, but no further cases have been identified. Of note, the patient\u2019s initial nasopharyngeal swab was negative, but a bronchoalveolar lavage was found to be positive for nCoV.<br><br>All clusters reported to date have occurred among family contacts or in a health care setting. Human-to-human transmission occurred in at least some of these clusters, however, the exact mode of transmission is unknown. So far, no evidence of sustained transmission beyond the clusters into the community has been observed.<br><br>Recent peer-reviewed papers published since the last update<br><br>The Coronavirus Study Group of the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses has published a proposed new designation for the novel coronavirus, the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (MERS-CoV). Reference: De Groot RJ, et al. Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (MERS-CoV): Announcement of the Coronavirus Study Group. J Virol. Published ahead of print 15 May 2013. doi:10.1128/JVI.01244-13.<br><br>Summary assessment<br><br>The nCoV is thought to be of animal origin and to be sporadically transmitted to humans through an as yet unknown route. However, it is clear that the virus can also be transmitted between humans. So far, human-to-human transmission has only been observed in health care facilities and close family contacts and sustained transmission in the community has not been observed. The continued appearance of cases that are not part of larger clusters, and who do not have a history of animal contact, increases concerns about possible community transmission. This possibility is being investigated by authorities in Saudi Arabia.<br><br>The infection of two health care workers who had contact with infected patients and other examples of nosocomial transmission re-emphasize the need for meticulous adherence to appropriate infection control measures when nCoV is suspected, beginning with initial patient triage. Current infection control recommendations can be found at: <br><a href=\"http://www.who.int/csr/disease/coronavirus_infections/en/\">http://www.who.int/csr/disease/coronavirus_infections/en/</a>.<br><br>The large number of cases with reported co-morbidities suggests that increased susceptibility from underlying medical conditions may play a role in transmission. In addition, it has now been demonstrated that nCoV infection may present atypically, and initially without respiratory symptoms, in immunocompromised individuals.<br><br>Limited evidence suggests that the use of nasopharyngeal swabs for diagnosis may not be as sensitive as the use of lower respiratory specimens. Lower respiratory specimens should be used for diagnosis in addition to nasopharyngeal swabs when they are available. If an nasopharyngeal swab tests negative, consider retesting using lower respiratory specimens such as sputum, endotracheal aspirate, or bronchoalveolar lavage. Clinicians should take care to follow strict infection prevention and control guidelines when collecting respiratory specimens of any kind.<br><br>The recent increase in cases may in part be related to increased awareness among the medical community, however the demonstrated ability of this virus to transmit between humans and to cause large outbreaks, has increased concerns about the possibility of sustained transmission. Countries in the Middle East in particular should maintain a high level of vigilance and a low threshold for testing of suspect cases. Current surveillance recommendations can be found at: <br><a href=\"http://www.who.int/csr/disease/coronavirus_infections/en/\">http://www.who.int/csr/disease/coronavirus_infections/en/</a>.<br><br>WHO expects that more cases will be identified. Control of the disease will require urgent multisectoral investigations aimed at identifying the source of the virus and the exposures that result in infection. It is critical for member states to report these cases and related information urgently to WHO, as required by the International Health Regulations, to inform effective international alertness, preparedness and response.", "comment_date": "2020-02-03T22:58:46Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "bruinflight", "comment_text": "Look, if NOW isn&#39;t the time to panic and disgorge mass hysteria at every turn, I can&#39;t think of a better time that would be...", "comment_date": "2020-02-03T22:35:22Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Tasoq", "comment_text": "WE MUSTN&#39;T PANIC<br>....<br><b>AAAAAAAHHHHHHHH</b>", "comment_date": "2020-02-03T20:53:26Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Freedom Of Speech", "comment_text": "The fatality rate can also be much higher than expected since China, a country notorious for censorship and has been proven to censor news about the recent Corona virus could have lied about the actual death rate.

The reason why I&#39;m furious about the whole thing is that there was absolutly no informatio prior our boarding, the crew discused it the night before and there was no public announcement. They did it because they were concerned for the crew and guests but what kind of satety measure is that if they allow people from Hong Kong to get on board. Media informed that there were positive cases of the coronavirus infection in Hong Kong at the time.

The virus has been proven to be a man-made bioweapon as they found evidence of Gene insertion in 4 places, from the HIV1 virus. Viruses can inherit/steal genes from other organisms but it&#39;s usually more diverse and takes a lot more time. And then if you look into the Pirbright institute (the people that made the virus) where the UN, EuroCommission and the Bill and Malinda Gates foundation have patents on both the virus and the vaccines for the virus AND are also the shareholders of the company. <br><br>And if you look at the simulation graphics that Bill Gates made in late 2019 and you compare them with the actual statistics and their graphics, they are almost identical. How did they know it would start in China, in the Wuhan area? Why is the &#39;wet market&#39; where they sell all the different animal foods, just a few kilometers away from the deadly diseases facility? Why did bill Gates announce an upcoming chemical threat in 2018? I find it too coincidental with the fake impeachment trials, the UN being caught by a leaked video where the same lady that said, a few weeks earlier &quot;there are no vaccine deaths&quot; then saying behind closed doors that people have been dying because they have been excessively using adjuvants in populations where those adjuvants are not even required. It is TOO coincidental that one could say &quot;it is cheesey&quot;. It&#39;s like if police are about arrest a criminal and the criminal kicked a poison gas grenade at their feet and said &quot;whoops&quot;. <br><br>It&#39;s a confirmed bioweapon and possibly the worst bioweapon known to date. Funny that every one had to panic for a fake Ebola and Animal Flu outbreak where Obama only stole resource from Africa, and now there is a legitimate bioweapon outbreak and all the Soros funded media are like &quot;don&#39;t panic, it&#39;s nothing&quot;. Yeah, like in the &quot;Saving Private Ryan&quot; movie where the two men are fighting with the knives and just as one guy puts the knife into the heart of the other guy he says &quot;shhh....shhhh.....&quot;. <br><br>So, saying &quot;don&#39;t panic&quot;...that is true in the sense that you need to keep your wits and not surrender to doing nothing. But don&#39;t interpret that as &quot;don&#39;t prepare&quot; because goods and services can potentially become a problem. People need to store their own food, water, medications etc. And here is some info. Cannabidiol was proven by Raphael Mechoulum to stop RNA being able to inject their code into your DNA and thereby reproduce. This means that it stops Ebola, HIV, and any other RNA virus from being able to reproduce. And a more easily accessible option is the plant called Prunella Vulgaris (self heal) which was found to prevent infection by HIV (40% success rate) by blocking it from reproducing in human cells. Both these sources are very safe and have almost no negative side effects. Much better than a vaccine which is made by the person (Bill Gates) that said &quot;If we do a good job with vaccines, we can lower the population of the world by another 15%&quot;", "comment_date": "2020-02-01T22:08:18Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "NEO ViSiON", "comment_text": "<a href=\"https://gisanddata.maps.arcgis.com/apps/opsdashboard/index.html?fbclid=IwAR16cl5jcfbe1owwfDP--fWxF_zdpK4LvzUzbmQCUoHmnJ-8MMqAlKvfTZo#/bda7594740fd40299423467b48e9ecf6\">https://gisanddata.maps.arcgis.com/apps/opsdashboard/index.html?fbclid=IwAR16cl5jcfbe1owwfDP--fWxF_zdpK4LvzUzbmQCUoHmnJ-8MMqAlKvfTZo#/bda7594740fd40299423467b48e9ecf6</a> 12 tys", "comment_date": "2020-02-01T22:04:19Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Whitney Connolly", "comment_text": "Someone called it the Kung Fu virus", "comment_date": "2020-02-01T22:04:16Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "theemissary1313", "comment_text": "Do you know what undermines a &quot;Don&#39;t panic&quot; message?

Even worse, the CCP actively prevents investigative efforts by outsiders to again save face.

In addition the death rate is higher than reported because China only reports coronoavirus deaths in those with no other pre-existing conditions.  So for instance if a person with cancer, diabetes or heart disease dies while ill with choeonavirus due to respiratory shut down, they still will not be classified as a chrononavirus death. They are reported as a cancer or heart death etc. So, the data is cooked as china seeks to make itself and its health system look good. Therefore,the death rate is much higher than reported! Altogether this tells me that this virus is a bit more dangerous than we think. In addition while the flu kills more or will this year it is not the same.

Also fatality rate is around 2% in General but for Wuhan city it&#39;s 5% which is extremely high for a virus with R0 of 2.5-3.6 ( Effective R0 might be higher due to low healthcare quality and crowdiness of China). Majority of death happened in Wuhan (90%) but it&#39;s due to fact that Diease has incubation period of 14 days and also deaths occur generally 7 days after symptoms show up. Diease has been in attention for like 10 days as of right now. Even in this 10 days it surprassed our expectations. Deaths outside China will start in possibly next week. People should stop underestimating this, I am not trying to sound like a doomsday person butChina cannot be trusted with the data provided, they frequently hide facts and censor real data as They did in 2003&#39;s SARS outbreak. They even bought offical in WHO but finally WHO manned up enough to declare emergency. We will see about this in coming days. Further actions never seen in history may need to be taken in future. Even the fraction of real data provided is already worrisome. SARS was deadlier than that with 11% Mortality, but it had R0 lesser than 1 which means we were able to kill it of once we quarantined every sick person also it could only spread after symptoms showed up. Ebola has Mortality rate of 50% but it can only spread with fluids. Flu has Mortality rate of 0.01 % and R0 of 1.3 it barely survives summers (0.8) generally thrives in winter (2.3) months.

The more contagious it is, the more people it&#39;s likely to spread to, and the more like it is to randomly mutate and kill everybody. And, no it&#39;s no longer contained in Wuhan. It&#39;s gone national in China. Also, if you believe the Chinese Communist dictatorship government&#39;s reports, you&#39;re just plain gullible.<br><br>&quot;You should worry about the influenza virus if you live in the USA right now, because it&#39;s a really bad flu season this year.&quot;<br><br>Not if you&#39;re a healthy and fit young adult with a healthy and normal immune system, no, because the flu won&#39;t be able to kill you. We don&#39;t know if Corona Virus can kill healthy young adults, but it looks like it can kill up to 20% of young healthy adults with normal immune systems if untreated. Worse yet, the Corona Virus, or the 2019-nVoc specifically, is transmissible even when asymptomatic, meaning there&#39;s no actual way to contain the spread of the disease because you don&#39;t necessarily see people showing symptoms before they become able to spread the disease, and some people never become symptomatic, but can still spread the disease that can still cause other people to get symptoms and a risk of death. The main problem with the disease is when it sometimes causes viral pneumonia, which requires hospitalisation to stop people from drowning to death in their own lung fluid. If the local healthcare systems become overburdened due to excessive numbers of cases, you could see the fatality rate rise to 20% as there&#39;s not enough machines to suck the lung fluids out. The problem is if the virus mutates too readily because first of all that means a higher risk of it mutating into a form that can kill us all, secondly of all if the virus mutates too frequently, people can get reinfected and put at risk of hospitalisation again if the virus mutates more than your immune system can recognise, and whilst it&#39;s not as deadly as SARS, there&#39;s more asymptomatic patients, and it can be spread by those patients. Also, if it mutates too rapidly, we might not be able to create a vaccine for it because it could mutate before we finish creating a vaccine for it, rendering the vaccine useless. In that case, we&#39;d have to hope it mutates into an innocuous form, essentially creating a natural inoculation against the virus like the west Africa ebola epidemic. The question is what is the mutation rate? That&#39;s something we have to figure out... It&#39;s all very well and good to say not panic, but people have to be prepared in case things go south. Being able to spread whilst patients are asymptomatic, it will break containment. You just have to accept you will get infected with the Corona Virus, and hope you&#39;re lucky and one of the 80+% that won&#39;t get viral pneumonia and become immune.
