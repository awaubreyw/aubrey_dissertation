Real password managers are not bad, it actually increases your chance against hackers. Why? Because it uses encryption to save your passwords, so the only thing saved on their server is gibberish that even if hackers have access to it, they wont be useful. The encryption key is usually stored on your local device, so only you can access the passwords that are saved. Now, what is the advantage of using password manager rather than writing your pass down on paper? One is these pass manager have random pass generator feature, which you can tweak to have however many letter you want. Because its random, its safer against bruteforce attacks than your usual passwords. The second is, no need to type your pass every time you want to use your pass since most have autofill or you can just copy your pass from the vault (your pass collection). Now, lets talk about the Nordpass here. Tbh i wouldnt recommend closed-source pass manager and nordpass seems like its made by nordvpn, which is known to have data leaks so i wouldnt trust them. Imo good pass manager are those open-sourced ones, since the time to patch after hacks (either ethical or unethical) are found is shorter in general.", "comment_date": "2020-03-25T11:00:10Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Niko L", "comment_text": "Don&#39;t waste money on paid password managers.

This was 30 years ago and I still  remember it clearly as originally I thought the problem was our crew, till everyone said the same thing and were all gearing down on the oars.", "comment_date": "2020-03-25T00:31:10Z", "likes_count": 219}, {"comment_by": "Cloudy Day", "comment_text": "I, as a competitive swimmer, was confused by the title \ud83e\udd26", "comment_date": "2020-03-25T00:29:14Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Chris Smith", "comment_text": "Stupid water", "comment_date": "2020-03-25T00:21:51Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "X X", "comment_text": "IT&#39;S &#39; B C &#39; OR &#39; A D &#39; ANYTHING ELSE IS A LIE , HISTORICALLY INCORRECT , AND BIGOTED !", "comment_date": "2020-03-25T00:13:50Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Daniel Staal", "comment_text": "Hmm.
