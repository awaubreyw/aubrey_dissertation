There&#39;s an obsession with cleaning oneself, and specially when it comes to women: they won&#39;t just wash their skin when they bathe, but they will scrap the skin with a very coarse loofah, to the point of damaging it, every single day, because they don&#39;t want it to get rough and coarse. They brush their body into massive skin allergies, because they wipe off clean the layer of oils that protects the skin every day when they wash. <br>Thing is, on the other side, for instance, in Spain, you never hear of a single Gypsy getting any diseases or allergies? Why? Because they play out on the dirt all day from their very early childhood, putting stuff in their mouth and building up tolerance to all crap. In the west too, as kids have been forced out of playgrounds due to parents feeling they&#39;re in danger (a danger that is more real in places like America than others), and have been stuck indoors, playing their Playstations, pigging up on cheetos and mountain dew, they started to develop food, pollen and skin allergies like everyone else, due to lack of exposure to the real world.
