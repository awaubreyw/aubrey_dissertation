The arsenic-based pesticides used from 1910 to 1980 that were sprayed on farmlands didn&#39;t just disappear. They have percolated into plumes of arsenic and have made it 100 feet underground.  Such contaminates on average travel down at a rate of 1 cm per day.  Most public water that we use and drink every day is several hundreds of feet down, but eventually, that arsenic will make its way there and contaminate our water.  Agricultural decisions made several decades ago will affect us and future generations through contaminated drinking water, which will last for thousands of years.  Lastly, low levels are not &quot;toxic&quot; but prolonged exposure to arsenic-based herbicides, which are still used today in the form of methylated arsenic, will cause several different types of cancers.  When studies look at exposures in isolation in a reductionist approach, it is easy to arrive at the conclusion that we live in a safe environment or &quot;safer&quot; environment, but we do not live in a reductionist world.  Cancer rates are from an accumulation, not one factor, such as pesticides and herbicides, but in a multitude of factors:  small particulates in the air, formaldehyde off-gassing in our housing materials, chromium in leather (etc).  It&#39;s also a low bar to say that we don&#39;t have it as bad as we used to.

DDT is an interesting one because when they were testing for that they found other harmful chemicals like PCB&#39;s Poly Chlorinated Biphenyl which were also very toxic. The effect of these chemicals took some time to work out. As for the DDT and  PCB&#39;s  and BPA/Phalates from plastics they effect the endocrine systems/hormones/reproductive DNA systems and in particular can effect the offspring / babies of infected adults.  The big downside is that some of the chemicals produced like DDT/ PCBs don&#39;t just disappear once you stop using them, they stay around in the environment and your body for a long time. They can effect several ecosystems ie fish get poisoned we eat fish we get poisoned we pass the poison onto our offspring. Through testing is required through all stages of life to work out the results before endorsing any of these chemicals benefits. For PCB&#39;s among other things  it lowered IQ in the babies by about 6%.  Places like Botanical Gardens in Auckland NZ no longer use insecticides/fungicides.  Washing off pesticides can be effective for cleaning off some pesticides but many effective pesticides are taken inside the plant through the leaves. Herbicides/Weedicides like round up are systemic and are taken up via the green parts of the plant and are transported via the vascular system. Although the LD rating /  Lethal Dose is low ( based how many rats it kills from ingestion) the effects of Round up are still not fully understood and people that have used the chemical frequently have suffered many disorders from skin to neurological disorders and again no through testing has been done. Benlate a systemic fungicide was taken off the market because miscarriage and concerns. 245T Herbicide/Weedicide  a formulation of Agent Orange sprayed on foliage as a growth hormone that resulted in defoliation of plants during the  Vietnam war was taken off the market for numerous cancers and health problems. The list goes on hence probably why it is better to pick crops that have cultivars that are resistant to pests/fungus. People forget these sprays have only been around for a few decades we had good food production before that. personally I don&#39;t use sprays never had too for my vegetables/fruit trees.

If someone feels uneasy about them, including the declarations of scientists about their safety, I think that is well-deserved--it&#39;s just too often uninformed. I&#39;m sorry, but I cannot tell you how many times across decades we have been assured that everything is good, that the hard lessons were learned with the DDT scare. (My grandfather stored bags and bags of DDT in the barn back in the day--it was wonderfully effective.)  Has there been progress? Yes, but the truth is that some types of contamination that typically go with them cannot easily be remedied or reversed, particularly in groundwater, which wasn&#39;t mentioned. For a current example, I would suggest reviewing the long approved use of Bromacil for pineapple production in Costa Rica, finally banned by that government last year because of the consequences of its use and what has happened to the workers&#39; communities there. Bromacil is a wonderful, US-developed and EPA-certified product, right?  How could it be that bad? Yet if end consumers, mostly in Europe, had any idea of what was being required in human and environmental costs to get them cheap, conventional pineapples, would they have still bought them?  If that isn&#39;t enough, how about exploring simple fertilization and the consequences that more than a century of easily-leaching chemical fertilization has had on nitrate levels in water supplies in major growing areas of the US? (ignorant organic farmers can contribute to the problem as well, but most conventional farmers will somewhat by default.) Many times with all these ag products, there is a wonderful short-term gain for a much-less-understood or announced long-term problem.   <a href=\"https://water.usgs.gov/nawqa/nutrients/pubs/wcp_v39_no12/\">https://water.usgs.gov/nawqa/nutrients/pubs/wcp_v39_no12/</a>", "comment_date": "2018-07-20T03:43:14Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Bill Geo", "comment_text": "If you live in a big-ish city in a first-ish country anything that you get on you plate was mass produced and had antibiotics and/of pesticides used in or on it.

A good solution would be to use some form of integrated pest management, such as the introduction of predatory and parasitic insects, predatory mites, fungi and viruses that only hone in on particular hosts. While were on the subject, I would also recommend using a diverse variety of native pollinators as opposed to introduced ones like Apis melifera.
