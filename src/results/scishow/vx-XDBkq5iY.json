Everest due to &quot;higher temperatures increasing pressure&quot;. That would only be true in a closed container (where volume cannot change). In fact, it&#39;s the opposite: warming air EXPANDS (if it&#39;s not contained), so there will be LESS oxygen (per volume). That&#39;s why old prop airplanes need a less rich fuel mix on hot days (because there&#39;s less oxygen in the air to mix with the fuel), or higher up. That&#39;s why airplanes need more runway to take off (less air to give lift) on hot days (or higher up).<br><br>The real reason global warming increases air density on Mr. Everest is because the ENTIRE atmosphere expands, including the &quot;thicker&quot; parts lower down.

Firstly, gravity differences aren&#39;t that important. The idealized difference in the force of gravity between 8850m ASL and 0 ASL is less than 0.3%. Besides that, gravity isn&#39;t really changing and as the air warms, if anything I&#39;d expect the volume of the atmosphere to increase meaning more air further away and experiencing the ever so slightly lower gravity further away. Why? Well the atmosphere isn&#39;t confined to a fixed volume, so it&#39;s not quite the same situation as a sealed bottle or something being heated and the pressure increasing. As the atmosphere warms, it can expand further up into space. That said, if the expectation is that temperature increase alone can directly lead to higher air pressures, then why do we see a belt of relatively low pressure around the equator where temperatures tend to be hotter? I&#39;m not convinced. By far, the main reason for air pressure is the weight of the air above which is primarily dependent on its mass. Is climate change increasing the mass of the atmosphere? I&#39;m thinking it could. As the temperature increases, the amount of water vapor in the atmosphere will increase. That&#39;s one source of additional atmospheric mass. Additionally, we&#39;re putting more carbon atoms into the air. For every carbon atom we put in the air we&#39;re roughly exchanging an oxygen molecule for a carbon dioxide molecule, which is about 37% heavier than oxygen. That&#39;s another source of additional atmospheric mass. These seem like more plausible explanations for why air pressure might increase as the planet warms.
