The problem in poor countries is access (physical and financial) to these medications. Even though it might help fight  40% of certain kinds of plasmodium, after 4 total shots, majority(60%)  of those infected will still experience full blown malaria which will be treated by conventional medication. Why should governments spend millions inoculating children against treatable diseases when it would be better off distributing treated mosquito nets and creating access to medication. I\u2019m not against vaccination in anyway. I\u2019m just highly skeptical of this sub par solution providing a false sense of security, taking away money that would be better spent implementing other more effective preventative measures that stop exposure.  Seems like the pharma corps want to recoup losses  made after years of flushing money down the drain on this low quality solution. The pilot programs are in highly corrupt countries where the leaders are  easily influenced to allow these kinds of programs which we know is only effective against a very narrow section of the plasmodium phenotypes in the wild.
