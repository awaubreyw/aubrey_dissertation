Essentially we do this everyday by using an intermediate like electricity, but conversion losses lower it&#39;s efficiency.

I reviewed under NDAs probably every technology described here, a total of over 200 different companies by the time I retired last year.  For the next few years the answer is definitely lithium based batteries.  Billions in investment has lowered costs and improved reliability to the point where my latest projects were paying ~$125/kWh for battery modules in the ~50MWh quantities.  ~90% efficient, very low standby losses, and extremely compact. Also, the primary companies here (Samsung, LG, BYD, CATL, Tesla, etc.) are large companies that can financially back long term warranties, which is a real requirement for storage projects that can cost 10&#39;s to 100&#39;s of $millions.  There is a need for longer term energy storage, and that is an ongoing area.  Compressed air would be great, but the problem of extracting the heat of compression during compression, storing it, and then reinjecting has been one several smart companies have tried and failed at.  Aside from the &quot;train&quot; noted here, there are many non-water gravity storage systems, but few if any can provide needed services at a low enough tech risk and cost.  Flywheels have made great strides, but stand by losses are too great to bear, and Li batteries now beat them at $/kWh by a wide margin.  Also, the edge of a grid storage flywheel may be traveling at equivalent to Mach 2, and if the mag bearings fail, the sudden energy release is a sight to see.   As many people noted,  pumped hydro storage is a mature tech and widely used around the world.  the USA hasn&#39;t built any new pumped storage in about 30 years, but that&#39;s mostly because of the politics of water in the Western USA.   China was under construction on 20GWh of pumped storage a few years ago.    I believe a lot of current efforts for long duration storage are about creating some energy-dense chemistry using off-peak wind and solar, such as H2, Methane, Ammonia, etc.", "comment_date": "2020-09-15T02:52:50Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Catalina Baldwin", "comment_text": "Hypothetically, what about storing energy mechanically using springs?
