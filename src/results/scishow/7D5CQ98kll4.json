Leading to higher survival rates of their offspring...<br>Whereas more peaceful individuals would be less effective at doing this.<br>This could create an increase in both sexual attraction towards members of the population that exhibit a greater ability to express negative emotions in the face... and also a greater chance of their offspring living to the age of sexual maturity in order to reproduce<br>Even if this only accounted for a 1-2% increase is offspring survival it would eventually catalyze into a statistically relevant change in the frequency of alleles among the population.<br>But there are definitely much stranger traits to be found in the animal kingdom than the human chin.<br>Have you seen a duck&#39;s penis???

Other mammals lips go all the way to the jaw while ours is only  close to half of that. My theory is; due to our mouth muscles and denture structure has pulled the bones inward causing a chin to form. If you push the line up the teeth like the other mammals then the chin would be almost none existence. I seen a video where a women in Japan wanted tiny feet and keep wearing small shoes.

The second one has to do with mouthbreathers. Humans before the homo sapiens tended to be nomads so they had to move constantly and actively hunt their food so the energy demand was much higher hence they had to breathe with more frequency and quantity to meet the physiological needs to survive on a daily basis. That said, when mankind became sedentary there was no longer needed to be breathing heavily to hunt and move around because as a species we learned to take advantage of what nature offered us and the need to run long distances to hunt down food eventually disappeared and our pharynx evolutionarily had to grow more to improve intake airflow in a resting state. This led to eventually getting us the characteristic of a loss of a really refined smell for a refinement of taste, both equilibrated in comparison to other animals who don&#39;t mind eating raw meat because the two senses are not that connected as in humans. And finally the use of the tongue to form such a great variety of sounds to communicate to each other, this had to make an important role to forming a cavity where the tongue could rest but at the same time a good range of movement and consistency to make cries, whispers, whistles...<br><br>Sorry for the long text.

This could potentially lead to pneumonia and death without procreating.<br>Thus there&#39;s an evolutionary pressure favoring ones who don&#39;t accidentally inhale water, or who do so less frequently.<br>If the bone below the mouth has even a slight protrusion putting it closer to the water, when the individual keeps their face above water their mouth is further from the water, decreasing the likelihood of accidentally inhaling water.<br><br>The larger the protrusion, the higher their likelihood of surviving and mating. Over millions of years, this created the jaw.<br><br>This happened during our evolution from Australopithecus to Hominidae. Some wading Australopithecus developed the downward protrusion of the jaw and upright posture. They spent much time wading in the water because they liked seafood. They also hunted and foraged on land.<br><br>A defect in the genes for jaw muscles later appeared in that group resulting in significantly smaller jaw muscles. The ones with the defect spent significantly <b>more</b> time in the water since the food on land was more difficult to chew. <br>Through millions of years of evolution, this led to a more pronounced chin along with the loss of body hair, webbing between fingers, fingertip wrinkling response to water, breath control, eventually to the hominids.<br><br>Being in water, these hominids didn&#39;t fear fire as land animals did.

Why do humans have chins, with biological males tending to have broader chins? What other facial feature shares this same pattern? Beards. Why do humans have coarse hair in localized regions? Typically, to help dry sweat, to potentially distribute informative social odors, sexual signaling, and as an anti-friction surface(prevents chaffing). Being that chins are not typically sweaty like an arm pit and are typically kept clean, anti-friction and sexual selection seem likely. Why would male faces need protection from friction? Well, perhaps like lions, it&#39;s to prevent inter-species aggression from causing too much damage. Being bipedal, our hands are freed up and we have the structural ability to punch and use weapons. The face is quite vulnerable to these types of attacks. Thick, coarse hair both cushions, prevents friction, and deflects blows. Having a stronger jaw would be helpful for this. Why only us? Well, why don&#39;t Chinese Water Deer have antlers? They don&#39;t need them. Humans have the weakest jaws compared to other apes and hominids.
