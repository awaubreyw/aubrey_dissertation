All animals (including ourselves) have thoughts and feeling and in fact have the same emotions. <br><br>Anyone who has had a pet can do a simple demonstration. When your cat or dog come up to to be pet they are doing two things: 1. They are coming to you not your sofa, not the table, not anything else, they go to you. They have remembered that you pet them and when they want to be pet again they know to come to you. They are to distinguish between you and everything else. This demonstrates thought. 2. When your pet gets the pet they wanted they perform a response or pleasure, and when they get pet the wrong way they perform a response of discomfort. This demonstrates that they can feel. Using MRI scans we can see the areas of the brain light up where emotions are in the same areas of our brain when you account for size. The fact we can treat other animals that appear to show signs of mental illness using the same medication that we use to treat that mental illness shows they not just feel but also have emotions and the same ones. <br><br>Why can&#39;t we &quot;listen&quot; to what animals have to say when they communicate? Well, you can and you can&#39;t. All things communicate uses their senses, it what senses they use to communicate that can differ. When it comes to mammals the majority communicate using primarily visually and secondarily tactilely and tertiarily verbally. It is not to say that don&#39;t use their other senses to gather information, just they don&#39;t use those sense to express information. Perhaps you are thinking you have seen your dog sniff to gather information before. What they are doing if sniffing for pheromones, which humans do the same thing after shaking hands but this isn&#39;t the same thing as expressing information. It is not common to see a communication model not like the one mentioned previously in mammals but some mammals do, such as humans. Humans flip what most mammals do and communicate primarily verbally and secondarily visually and tactilely. <br><br>Your communication model is something \u00a0are born with and language is something you learn. Language is based on communication models, so all human languages you learn with primarily involve verbal components. Usually we don&#39;t involve visual communication in our language but rather use the same visual communication across our species and call this body language (which is a poor term as it isn&#39;t a language). There are some visual languages (such a sign language) but all of those languages are based upon the use of verbal language and directly translating that into hand singles or otherwise to express thought in the same way you do verbal language. Because some visual languages exist, we can and have taught other animals how to &quot;speak&quot; our visual languages, such as Koko the gorilla. We have a hard time learning other species visual languages because unlike ours they don&#39;t base their visual languages in a verbal like way. <br><br>Can other species that share the same communication models communicate with one another. Yes, but not completely. While latin isn&#39;t a communication model but rather a language we can latin demonstrate a point. There are languages called romance languages with are based upon latin: spanish, french, portuguese, italian, romanian, etc. While all of the romance languages are different languages, because they are based on the same language they can use those different languages to express thought amongst themselves without having to know the other language but have difficulty expressing increasing complex ideas. Different species that share the same communication model have developed their own languages based on the same model and can express ideas amongst each other but the more complex the idea the harder it is to express it. Just like we can express ideas in english to someone who only understands japanese by using on simple level, but when we share the same language we express even more complex ideas. <br><br>Why this is important when it come to autistic people is understanding our communication differences. Through my own understanding and experiences with communication as well as speaking to other autistic people it is my understanding that perhaps our communication model is much like other mammals being primarily visual and secondary tactilely and tertiarily verbally. Having a different communication model could explain our communication differences and sharing the same communication model as most mammals could explain we understand other mammals a lot more easily. <br><br>When thinking about how I express emotions, my emotes are not naturally my face (a demonstration of primarily using verbal communication up close as having facial emotes aids in verbal communication in a close range to demonstrate subtlety of language) but rather my stims using the rest body. Emoting with your body is something allistic people do to a degree but not much as their face, much like my primary emotes being with my body but there a few natural emotes with my face such as smiling when in uncomfortable situations (which other primates also use to demonstrate aggression and ward off others) but there a few stims I also do using my face but not as many. Something that also comes naturally to me is expressing how I feel more complex ideas tactilely, such as directions, needs, wants, providing comfort, expressing emotion, location, etc.", "comment_date": "2019-01-02T21:30:44Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "AlbinoTuxedo", "comment_text": "I&#39;ve always wanted to know why bright lights make me sneeze, I&#39;ve had it since I was a little kid and it&#39;s always fascinated me; photonic sneezing, I believe its called", "comment_date": "2019-01-02T21:04:50Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "The incarnation of boredom", "comment_text": "&quot;The science of happiness&quot;<br><br>&quot;Butt hair&quot;<br><br>ok then", "comment_date": "2019-01-02T20:53:51Z", "likes_count": 2}, {"comment_by": "Gawayne", "comment_text": "Recycling is important for the environment yawl", "comment_date": "2019-01-02T20:35:37Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "sniperammow", "comment_text": "I go cycling a lot and when I shave my butt hair nothing is wrong until I do a 40 km+ ride, the area between my legs gets red and painful.", "comment_date": "2019-01-02T20:25:14Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "DaCo Video", "comment_text": "I have no concept of the stuff he&#39;s talking about with love and the hypothalmus lmao.", "comment_date": "2019-01-02T20:11:46Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "MercurialCorsair", "comment_text": "The hearts are actually meant to look similar to butts and cleavage in shape,  the real reason for valentine&#39;s day", "comment_date": "2019-01-02T20:04:49Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Popacapify", "comment_text": "Never thought that much about butt hair before...", "comment_date": "2019-01-02T19:40:30Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "eSKAone", "comment_text": "Now we know how cruel it is to breed &quot;dogs&quot; with not real tails.", "comment_date": "2019-01-02T19:35:51Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "eSKAone", "comment_text": "If tommorow dogs would start talking, could we really justify to dominate, breed, and sell them like that any longer?

We often laugh at things that would or could be perceived as painful. A laugh communicates that it is not serious. On both sides, the person who hurts themselves might laugh to say it isn&#39;t serious or the person watching might laugh to say it isn&#39;t serious. <br>If you play peekaboo with a child that child might get scared but they might also laugh because they realize instinctively that it is not serious. You can watch videos of this.<br>This would have been useful when bumps in the night startled our ancestors as they tried to sleep. If a fart wakes you from a deep sleep a laugh tells your startled wife that she doesn&#39;t need to panic. Which brings us to why we don&#39;t find things funny. If something is painful like a football in the groin many will find this funny because they have had the experience and know that it is not serious but the person getting the football in the groin is probably in pain and that pain prevents the laughter, it just too soon. If they rewatch that video on YouTube they are given the chance to reassess\u00a0just how serious it actually was and perhaps the over the top reaction might be seen as funny. <br>Think of a comic who pushes the edge and points at some social issue that is currently or recently heated. Let&#39;s take the trans issue because that was recently brought up by a comic who was approached after a show by an angry audience member who is trans. They express how hurtful the joke was how it offended them and how they wanted the comic to stop telling it. A joke will never &quot;land&quot; with everyone, some don&#39;t get the joke which often happens when you can&#39;t relate to the pain or suffering that is presented or how it was trivialized to be perceived as not serious. For some it will be too soon and the pain current or unresolved and being told that is not serious can actually be more painful.
