As Magyar and Spanish are in different Language Families (Uralic and Indo-European), the differences are more marked. I suspect that, if the languages were more closely related (say Spanish and Italian), the evidence for different brain processing would be less obvious. Humans, for example, with sufficient training, can distinguish the subtle differences between the songs of different birds within the same species. I am unaware of any experiment that tried a null-set case where the notes of the song were randomly scrambled, but I suspect that we could pick that up as &quot;wrong&quot; somehow. I do not think that says much about linguistic processing, though.
