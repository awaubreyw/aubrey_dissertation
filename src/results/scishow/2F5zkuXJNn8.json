It was thought they were first built in the Iron Age, a period that began around 800 BC. Four of these sites have been radiocarbon dated to about 3640-3360 BC in the Neolithic period - before the erection of Stonehenge&#39;s stone circle. It is on these crannogs, however, that there is a vast perfusion of ancient, fossilised haggis bones, suggesting that long ago they were bred by early man for their meat or even guard haggis to warn off predators.\r<br>Well, putting facts and speculation aside, the plain, indisputable fact is; where the highlander was, so there was the haggis!  <br>\r<br><br><br><a href=\"https://play.google.com/store/books/details/Cuger_Brant_The_Haggis?id=wFckEAAAQBAJ\">https://play.google.com/store/books/details/Cuger_Brant_The_Haggis?id=wFckEAAAQBAJ</a>", "comment_date": "2021-08-12T19:29:02Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Cracno112", "comment_text": "God.

They stated that ahead of this big adjustment there would be predecessor adjustments that would come in waves.\r<br>\r<br> Wave#1 occurred on May 8 when the Colonial Pipeline was forced to close where it crosses the Mississippi River and a truss on the I-40 bridge to Memphis snapped. Following that we had a refinery explode at the Ohio River headwaters, then a DC pedestrian bridge collapse and the SurfSide condo collapse. The SE Portion of the US cannot move and is poised to rip off. The emission maps showed the tension in the SE Portion on June 5.\r<br>\r<br>Then the tension shifted to the Gulf of Mexico  when a buoy throbbed for a day on July 8 along the path from the Pemex gas field explosion to New Orleans. This happened simultaneously to a major water main break at Jackson, MS. \r<br>\r<br>The next day a cruise ship went aground in Kentucky while cruising the Cumberland River. The river bottom had shifted. \r<br>\r<br>If Wave#1 focused on the SE Portion of the US to the EAST of the Mississippi River what will happen to that portion of the US to the WEST of the Mississippi River? \r<br>\r<br>On that same day, July 8, a massive quake swarm on the California/Nevada border began. Notably, SO2 and CO emissions from rock shifting began to focus on western Canada, which sustained a crane collapse in BC.\r<br>\r<br>Confirmation 7/31/2021: As was noted when the Pemex gas field exploded in an underwater eruption, and as we have stated since the start of the 7 of 10 Plate Movements, the New Madrid Adjustment will start its unzipping in Mexico. \r<br>\r<br>Draw a line from the Mexico City/Pemex region to New Orleans and this line passes through the current active buoy location. This is very significant as this will soon destabilize the continental US near and above New Orleans. That the lowlands near Jackson, MS are shifting in step with the buoy warnings is not a surprise.\r<br>\r<br>Beyond these signs that the rock in the western 2/3 of the N American Plate is shifting toward the Pacific are the signs of unease in the US and Russian governments. Hal Turner reports a rumor that filling station chains have been warned there will be a gasoline shortage soon, so the next delivery of gasoline might be their last. \r<br>\r<br>There is a long North American Plate border running down through the Arctic, and when the North American Plate twitches, this could affect Siberia too. Thus the temporary closing of the Nord gas line and military exercises in Siberia look suspicious.\r<br>\r<br>Why are some filling station chains suddenly getting a notice that gasoline delivery to them will soon stop? Their primary suppliers are getting a confidential notice from the US Military that there could be a gasoline shortage pending if the New Madrid Fault Line ruptures. \r<br>\r<br>Sworn to silence to prevent panic if the public were to learn of this, these suppliers could not stop themselves from issuing what they thought was a confidential message to their clients. Their concern is that true emergencies would arise and leave the public without any means to escape a catastrophe.
