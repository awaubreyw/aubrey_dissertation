They have different methods for determining the age of rock layers. However, there is one small problem. Ancient books tell us that a cycle of natural disasters threatens the earth and all living things. The cause of this cycle of disasters is a ninth planet in our solar system orbiting the sun in an eccentric orbit. Features of the natural disaster include a massive tidal wave, higher than the highest mountain, flooding, storms, rain, volcanic eruptions, earthquakes and a fiery asteroid bombardment. That planet is surrounded by a gigantic twisting cloud of dust and meteorites. That cloud obscures the atmosphere, pollutes the water and covers the whole planet Earth with that dust. At the end of the crossing of this planet 9, the earth is covered with a horizontal layer of wet mud, a mixture of sand, clay, lime, fossils of sea and land animals, shells and the deposit of that dust cloud and asteroids. So in every layer on our planet we will find  material of the same antiquity, perhaps many millions of years old: the deposit of extraterrestrial clay and meteorites. Even the youngest, topmost earth layer, which is less than 6,000 years old, also includes the same very old deposit. If you don&#39;t know about this cycle, you have no idea how our history has evolved. To learn much more about planet 9, the recurring flood cycle and its timeline, the re-creation of civilizations and ancient high technology, read the e-book: &quot;Planet 9 = Nibiru&quot;. It can be read on any computer, tablet or smartphone.

Further evidence of this is the Younger Dryus people that lived in what is modern day New Jersey, Rhode Island and Connecticut!!!

There&#39;s something missing here in the human chain of events. Blacks and whites, orientals and Europeans, Native Americans Etc look absolutely nothing like each other. So what you are predisposing, is that radical physical characteristics changed rapidly from The Great Migration of Africa into the far reaches of the planet. Sorry but I&#39;m not buying it. Especially when the timeline proves otherwise. Changing oceans, land bridges and Ice Bridges, along with severe changes in weather would have greatly impeded this type of Mass travel. Then you have to account for the radical physical changes in humanity from one group to the next. I honestly think it is a disservice to each variety so to speak, of human traits. Why is it so hard to just merely accept Who We Are, rather than make a race game out of it. Back to the native travel routes. We can suppose a lot. If we find a stonepoint that is familiar to a given geographical occurrence, but then find that same Stone 1500 miles away, it is easier to assume stone tools and weapons along with their technology, would have traveled with the makers into other areas of the globe. Don&#39;t laugh it&#39;s definitely possible. Case in point... Here in Southern Michigan a friend was Excavating an area next to his field to build a garage. In order to level this out, and then add sand for the base, there had to be several feet dugout with a bulldozer. Going out to look at the site the next morning, he found a Stone Point laying up on top of the ground. With there being absolutely no mistake about it, upon looking at it, I immediately identified it as a Folsom point. What was it doing there several feet into the ground of Southern Michigan? The sauk, Fox, Sioux, Ojibwe, Potawatomi, Iroquois, and other bands traveled in and out of Michigan area for many millennia. Any stone technology each would have possessed, can be scattered for hundreds of miles, if not 1,000 miles in some cases. We can say where we believe technology has an origin, but we definitely cannot say that it is always exclusive to that geographical location. Stating that these Footprints only belong to children who were out hunter-gathering, isn&#39;t so far off, because it is well known that women and children did these things in Native groups, where the men would be off Hunting. Food preparation, Gathering, preparing skins and general encampment family details would definitely go to the women and the children. Theories are not facts.
