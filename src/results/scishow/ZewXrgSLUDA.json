If they&#39;re starved of another food source, then one colony will eventually consume the other, so whichever one comes out on top is the predator, right? <br><br>I guess it would be like putting a cat in a box with a bunch of rats, then closing it and coming back after some time to see if there are no rats, or if the cat was overwhelmed by the rats and they ate it.
