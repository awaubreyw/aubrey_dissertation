After a couple of minutes to allow the pan sufficient heating time, I began to slowly stir through the stuff. Within another couple of minutes, I was forced to open a window as the beginning &quot;puffs&quot; from the reaction began bursting into the air... They were never particularly large or obnoxious, but the steady strings of them as I stirred and rolled the powder around were aerating the stuff and making a HORRIBLY obnoxious odor as well as bringing a burning sensation to my nose and throat...<br><br>    Okay... this goes on for some 15 or 20 minutes, and then steadily diminishes to relative peace again... no amount of stirring can keep it going on. Upon close inspection at this point, including a comparison with a small quantity of original baking soda, reveals that the powder cooked in the pan is somewhat darker grayish in color than the pearly white of the soda...<br><br>     THIS is sodium carbonate, or &quot;washing soda&quot; as they called it in the older times... It must be kept in a sealed container or it draws humidity and reverts back into baking soda again, though you can cook it down to &quot;washing soda&quot; repeatedly without harm done... It&#39;s a cleaning booster, though I&#39;m not entirely sure of what exact boosting qualities it carries... I do know that added in reasonable amounts to degreasing agents and other surfactant heavy soaps, the cleaning intensity is noticeably &quot;stronger&quot; without a lot of time or money invested toward the &quot;novel&quot; ingredient... There IS a point of diminishing returns, but this stuff is capable of boosting even ordinary hair-care products (like plain shampoo) into a laundry degreasing agent almost as effective as GoJo... AND my personal experimentation started with VO5 &quot;Extra Body&quot; shampoo, as it seems to lack all the lotions, moisturizing contaminants and other dubious &quot;enriching&quot; substances that might dubiously alter the formula, even if it does claim to be enriched with vitamins or essence of some kind...<br><br>     In any case, you can meter the stuff directly into a load of laundry, in addition to whatever particular brand of soap you prefer, and no fear of destroying the perfume qualities... It CAN diminish some of the lifespan of some fabrics, but those are mostly not intended to be involved in degreasing or any activity that might lead to it in the first place... Still, a sparing addition of wash soda in lieu of declaring a precious garment &quot;ruined&quot; at once might be the better alternative all together... <br><br>    SO risk assessment is UP TO YOU...  ;o)", "comment_date": "2021-12-13T06:31:18Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Trevor Riley", "comment_text": "Gee thanks....im even more confused now", "comment_date": "2021-12-13T03:09:40Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "t0mn8r", "comment_text": "Very interesting.", "comment_date": "2021-12-13T00:26:24Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Luut\u00e2s \u039b\u03bf\u03cd\u03c4\u03b1\u03c2 \u041b\u0443\u0301\u0442\u043e\u0441 \u0932\u0942\u0924\u0938 \u91ce\u4eba \u0644\u0648\u062a\u0627\u0633", "comment_text": "In portuguese we call them <b>Bicarbonato de s\u00f3dio</b> and <b>Fermento em p\u00f3</b>", "comment_date": "2021-12-12T16:23:18Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "David Owen", "comment_text": "\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02 thank you", "comment_date": "2021-12-12T12:52:41Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "David Carlson", "comment_text": "Good info, but could you not rush it?", "comment_date": "2021-12-12T04:02:47Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Zenabu Bawah", "comment_text": "informative.
