Kharazmi was born in Kharazm about 440 years before the Mongols\u2019 invasion to Iran. So, he was Iranian.) By the way, those scientific works do not originate from the Islamic view and attitude.

That why in serious and encyclopedic Islamic traditional school, we always taught that beside al Quran, there is another god guidance (ayatullah) called ayat kauniyah (the universe and all god creation in it). and for qur&#39;anic scholars, we also know --from al Quran it self, there are two others god guidance (ayatullah), that we as muslims should seek for God Guidances: called as ayat insaniyah (human being) and ayat tarikhiyyah (human history).\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>if common muslims and it scholars, uses all 4 God Guidance in balanced ways, we will not always fall into legalistic point of view when we talking or examining Islam point of view about woman/feminism, politics, evolution, LGBTQ issues, democracy, secularism, separation between religion and state. etc. for me, if sociology, political science, statistics, history on the rise and fall of civilizations/countries (as interpreters of ayat kauniyah and ayat tarikhiyyah) comes to the conclusion that democracy with separation between religion and state, is the best political system in the world for advancement human civilizations, then all Muslims should choose democracy with separation between religion and state, as preferable political system to practice in all Muslims majority countries. \r<br>\r<br>\r<br>also if expert on biology, doctors, psychiatry, etc (as interpreter of ayat kauniyah and ayat insaniyah) , said that beside man and woman (as gender), we also has intersex, hemaprodyte, woman with more testosterones, man with more X chromosome, etc, then all Muslims should choose to agree that god him self gave us guidance / ayat that beside man and woman as gender, there also another genders/pronouns that we should cherish, protect, and respect (cos if we don&#39;t respect others God Creations, are similarly with we don&#39;t respect our God as their Creator).\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>if we stubborn, only picks, one ayatullah, we called al Quran (holy scripture/ayat Qauliyah), as the one and only god guidance to follow, then muslims and it scholars, will always fall upon into legalistic point of view (fiqh oriented) when we examining what is islamic point view on everything under the sky. wahabbiyah, isis, al Qaida, etc are trapped in this narrow point of view about Islam and its believe. of course, for responsible and encyclopedic islamic teaching, all those narrow point views on Islam are wrong (at least incomplete), misguided, and disrespecting God. \r<br>\r<br>\r<br>umar bin khattab, as on of few sahabah (closed friend of Prophet), several times choose to disregarding some textual issues stated clearly in al Quran, and pick other decision after he choosed as Muhammad successor, as leader (khalifah/amir),  if there are more fairer and more justice way (socially)  on making decision as Amir/Leader, rather than choose from what already state very clear in al Quran. he always choose more fairer and more justice, even others sahabah question his decision. and as we know it, umar bin khattab is one of several sahabah (closed friend of Prophet) that guaranteed (informed) by the Prophet that he is going to heaven. his way of leadership decision, was a hard evidence that the closest friend to Muhammad, also not only consider holy scripture (ayat Qauliyah), but also social aspect, fairness, and justice (ayat kauniyah), when he making decision as a leader. \r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>nobody in umar bin khattab time, dare to called umar bin khattab as heretic/bid&#39;ah, kuffar, or infidel. but in modern era, several of loud muslims, loud muslim scholars, and most of jihadist will immediately call us heretic/bid&#39;ah, kuffar, or infidel if we also uses 3 other God Guidances beside ayat Qauliyah, when we speak, analyze, examining islamic point of view on everything under the sun. how strange is it, if we following completes God Guidance&#39;s, then be called as infidel, kuffar, or bid&#39;ah. legalistic approach (fiqh oriented) on Islam has bad impact on advancement of Islamic civilization, and has backward effect on development of its peoples: the Muslims. but yes, in Islamic jurisprudence (ushul fiqh), we also has similar concept with Umar way, but unfortunately has more narrowed approach and clearly far from sufficient to be implemented in modern era, we call them: maslahah mursalah (public good principle) and  maqashid syariah (ratio legal over legal specific). \r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>if muslims also incorporate social science, biology, technology, history, political science, psychology, etc (as part of rightful interpreter all of God Guidancs/ayatullah), many problem we faced today in many part of Muslim countries, will be addressed in responsible way. Muhammad him self, in his own word (Hadits Bukhari Collection no 6015), muslims should follow person with specific expertise on handling matter, so let political scientist handle political matter, health matter should handle by doctors, etc. do not let everything under authority of quranic expert. in general, muslim should treat expert on other ayatullah (scientist as rightful interpreter whole universe and all of His Creations in it, as rightful interpreter human being behavior and it history) equal to expert on holy scripture (al quran). Furthermore, on all wide range of social issues, every new founding/understanding as result from responsible research by scientist, should supersede (abrogate) any old interpretation from holy scripture, cos all of every new founding/understanding as result from responsible research by scientist, are also rightful interpreter of God Guidance (ayatullah). falling to do so, should be interpreted as a disqualified argument/opinion.\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>Many argument/opinion base on fiqh (islamic legal specific), kalam (theology) and falsafah (philosophy), factually in most areas are quite obsolete for addressing social, economic, and political problem in modern era, cos most of them are derived only from ayat Qauliyah (Quranic centric), which is an incomplete way to sorting our problem in modern era. Most of old argument/opinion already supersede/abrogated by new founding/understanding as result from responsible research by scientist. Muslims should back to the complete of God Guidance in balance way on solving problem in Muslims world, not only using holy scripture as final say. and stop kuffar/infidel calling game, cos that game from a complete, genuine, and responsible interpretation of 4 God Guidances, is simply un islamic.\r<br>\r<br>and, as an open end conclusion, there is a deeper question: why common muslims and its scholars dare to disregarding 3 other God Guidances? why muslims and its scholars become legalistic (only focus on 1 ayatullah / 1 God Gudance (ayat Qauliyah) called alquran, as if salvation of a civilization fate can be and must be depend on 1 cause only?  as brief answer is: corruption and abuse of power by people in high power, it cronies, and big business that closed to muslim countries rulers. all of them, almost single handedly creates and propagate common muslims and its scholars into disregarding 3 other God Guidances.\r<br>\r<br>peoples in power, it cronies, and big business that closed to muslim countries rulers push and push relentlessly to narrow interpretation on morals and public interest thru perverted interpretation on the holy scripture. even, they dare to appoint unqualified islamic scholar as qadi for them to uses as fatwa producers in favors to their vested interest. since then, islamic civilization goes down spiral into inevitable decline from it&#39;s greatness. many fatwa produced in their regime will makes serious, genuine, and responsible islamic scholar scratching their head and shocked. fatwa on mihnah policy, etc, is among of perverted interpretation on holy scripture. it lead to tradition/repetition on using narrow interpretation islamic law for beating and punishing dissent and discontent on social injustice in islamic society.\r<br>\r<br>furthermore, it lead islamic society to become close minded, anti science, and trapped in textual approach tradition on just 1 god guidance called al quran (ayat Qauliyah) only, with narrow and more narrow interpretation. common muslim today and it scholar today are the real victims of their legacy. lets wake them up, by spreading the real genuine of God Guidances and it&#39;s rightful interpreters. amen.", "comment_date": "2021-09-04T01:50:03Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Faisal", "comment_text": "There was more books in Baghdad but mongols destroyed everything", "comment_date": "2021-09-03T02:45:02Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Ehsan sarshar", "comment_text": "if we say He was Persian doesn&#39;t mean Iran. scholars from Afghanistan, Uzbekistan, Tajikistan and Turkmenistan also called Persians", "comment_date": "2021-08-31T16:24:07Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Circassian Man", "comment_text": "Shame that people who once was the locomotives of civilization and science of the whole world came to this.", "comment_date": "2021-08-24T08:49:42Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "A", "comment_text": "SubhaanAllah, <br>Suwar ki Gaand me kitne ched hote hne, ye sabase pahale muslim scientists ne hi bataya the,<br>Nabi paak Muhammad saw ne Sybase pahale ye science baat bataai thi ki shaitan paad maarta Hua bhagata he<br>SubhaanAllah MashahAllah", "comment_date": "2021-08-24T04:22:47Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Saif Iqbal", "comment_text": "I&#39;m so glad this video exists, with racism and islamophobia being normal in todays world.", "comment_date": "2021-08-22T16:48:19Z", "likes_count": 3}, {"comment_by": "Aaron E", "comment_text": "I love this for it&#39;s information and; that it P. o.s  those on the political right! \ud83d\ude03\ud83d\ude03\ud83d\ude03\ud83d\ude01", "comment_date": "2021-08-12T17:54:27Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "steve angel", "comment_text": "And then they burned the Library of Alexandria............", "comment_date": "2021-08-04T02:06:22Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "TheFlowerOfLife", "comment_text": "Indian?

Several well-known Indian books such as\u00a0Mahabharata, parts of the\u00a0Vedas,\u00a0Yoga-Vasistha,\u00a0Bhagavad-Gita\u00a0and\u00a0Bhagavata Purana\u00a0were thus translated. The most fundamental views contained within these texts express the crux of natural philosophy: a universe in constant transformation, wherein elements are interconnected, sharing in absolute unity and having a sequence of creation. The\u00a0Yoga-Vasistha, for example, a collection of stories and fables nearly 30,000 verses in length, \u00a0was appreciated for its \u201crealities, diverse morals, \u00a0and remarkable advice.\u201d</b><br><br>Under Dara Shukoh some 50 major Indian works\u00a0were translated, among them the\u00a0Upanishads, the pinnacle part of the\u00a0Vedas\u00a0script, which he considered imbued with the power to make people \u201cimperishable, unsolicitous and eternally liberated.\u201d His rendering was later translated into Latin in the 18th century by Anquetil Duperron of France. It was read in turn by the eminent 19th-century German philosopher Arthur Schopenhauer, who was so impressed by the universality of its message that he kept a copy open on a table near his bed.<br><br><br>Much of what Akbar and his successors learned to value, however, had already been observed centuries before. During his years in India in the 11th century, Abu al-Rayan al-Biruni, an all-around erudite from Kath in Central Asia, studied Sanskrit and researched the arts, literature and science. He analyzed meta-physics in Vedic texts and translated a number of them into Arabic, including selections from\u00a0Patanjali\u2019s\u00a0Yoga-Sutras, a philosophical compilation, and the 700-verse\u00a0Bhagavad-Gita. In his own book,\u00a0Kitab\u00a0Ta\u2019rikh al-Hind\u00a0(Book of Indian History, popularly known as\u00a0Alberuni\u2019s India), he introduced Muslim readers to Indian scholarly culture. Al-Biruni admits in the introduction that despite cultural and linguistic barriers, his book is an attempt to offer \u201cthe essential facts for any Muslim who wanted to converse with Hindus and to discuss with them questions of religion, science, or literature.\u201d\u00a0<br><br>\u00a0He also identi\ufb01es crossovers between Indian sci-ence and literature, notably\u00a0Kalila wa Dimna\u00a0(Kalila and Dimna), a celebrated book in the Middle East since the early medieval period. Based on an earlier Indian work,\u00a0Pancatantra\u00a0(Five Principles), it was written down from the oral tradition in the third century BCE, and it uses animal fables (Kalila and Dimna are jackals) to tell stories about human conduct and the arts of governance.<br><br>COURTESY:- <a href=\"https://www.aramcoworld.com/Articles/September-2017/Islamic-Science-s-India-Connection\">https://www.aramcoworld.com/Articles/September-2017/Islamic-Science-s-India-Connection</a>", "comment_date": "2021-05-02T16:31:31Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "FQ MS", "comment_text": "All of that scientists were iranian\ud83d\ude0e\ud83c\uddee\ud83c\uddf7...", "comment_date": "2021-05-01T22:28:47Z", "likes_count": 3}, {"comment_by": "wylieecoyote", "comment_text": "The Middle East and Arab Word made significant progress for the world and the wisdom spread throughout the world.

No one had the authority or power to declare something forbidden or shut down an avenue of science (despite what people like Neil Degrasse Tyson would have you believe). Scholars were free to pursue their interests and were more likely to be hindered by political entanglements or loss of patronage than they were by any religious policing.  Central to this freedom is: 2) Islam&#39;s view of knowledge and science, not as a threat to God&#39;s Authority but, in fact, the only true path to understanding the majesty and might of God.  The Quran itself is FULL of Verses that Spur people to go look and examine the natural world, find out how things were created and made the way you see them now from plants and animals to stars and mountains and by doing so get to know God more clearly.  The lack of those 2 obstacles in Islamic cultures helped spur on the desire and the success of those institutions of learning.  Unfortunately when the Mongol invasion came, it destroyed most of the economic infrastructure of the eastern half of the Muslim world while the Western Half suffered the aftermath of International trade shifting west to the cross-Atlantic with the discovery of the new world.  It was mostly the Loss of wealth and patronage system in most of the Islamic world that did away with that Golden age and not any religious doctrine.", "comment_date": "2020-10-25T19:20:08Z", "likes_count": 3}, {"comment_by": "al", "comment_text": "i like the hair!", "comment_date": "2020-10-25T18:18:37Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Nana Owusu", "comment_text": "I thought it was admitted that the faith of the scientists in that age drove their scientific pursuits.

We could agree fractionally that ethnicity could have an impact but it is culture, perspective, upbringing, struggle that offers the diversity you&#39;re all suggesting. Ethnicity is one of the ways you could easily adopt promising talent into a situation but it is not the trait that matters. Europe and China&#39;s stagnation is due to certain factors as well. It could be assured that easy communication, ample prosperity, law, a cross trade of talent that can meet will have similar results. That kind of positive development is noted in numerous empires throughout history and such things come to be when stability arises and people with promise can focus their energies on breakable challenges. We can however bet that a golden age, wherever it occurs is finite in length and given enough time the variables will shift and progress will slow or even halt. What can be said is that these golden ages did not spontaneously occur in fresh empires but were, as stated in the video, seeded from prior civilizations that were at the brink of stagnation and risking accumulated knowledge. Our golden ages are beginning to transfer more rapidly in recent centuries as the stakes rise and rapid progress leaches good into bad soil preventing further blossoming. It has always happened this way and it continues now as we risk stability in favor of retracing our steps into the golden past as well as doubt the promise of pursuing difficult answers to difficult questions.", "comment_date": "2020-10-25T01:59:00Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Alfred The Patient XCVI", "comment_text": "arabs and persians translated the greek and latin books from the Byzantine Empire.", "comment_date": "2020-10-25T00:58:32Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "JACQUES-A-DAUMUS", "comment_text": "Diversity leads to better science?

The video mentions about how they benefitted a lot from ideas taken in from the Greeks, Indians and Chinese, but at least one (if not two) of those groups isn&#39;t particularly diverse - and still produced a lot of knowledge. So sure, diversity might help, but it isn&#39;t a pre-requisite for science. Another thing those who advance this idea often get wrong is to pretend as if diversity has no costs, except it does. They only highlight one side of the equation - the positives - but neglect to mention the negative aspects. Such as conflict and tribalism. Probably because they assume that&#39;s somehow not inherent and so will simply go away once people get over outdated ideas like racism or sexism or Islamophobia. Except that those categories in themselves represent a very narrow way of looking at human identity and diversity. Tribalism is alive and well, and persists thanks to our prodigious inventiveness at formulating new identities and axes of differences. For instance, political identification is not a biological trait, and yet today many people act in very tribal ways along that axis - getting into conflicts with and/or avoiding the opposite tribe, and equally importantly huddling together in echo chambers with their own. The more differences your population starts with, the more &#39;nucleation points&#39; i.e. bases for such tribal behaviors to emerge there are. And that can lead to a lot of negative outcomes, including in scientific research (scientists are also human, after all). And these are just a couple of the costs of diversity. To accurate assess just how much of a benefit diversity provides, one would have to count both the benefits and the costs, to arrive at a net result.

We\u2019ve lied, we\u2019ve stolen, we\u2019ve sinned sexually, and we\u2019ve taken God\u2019s name in vain; which makes us liars, thieves, fornicators and blasphemers. James 2 : 10 also states that breaking even just one commandment makes us guilty of breaking them all.<br><br>The problem is, we can never \u2018outweigh\u2019 our sin with good deeds because The Creator is perfect in Holiness, meaning his standard is beyond our reach. He is also perfect in Justice, meaning, EVERY sin will be brought to light, and punished. The punishment for our sin is death, and Hell; a place of Eternal Fire, where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth.<br><br>Fortunately God is also perfect in Love, so 2000 years ago, Jesus Christ left his throne in heaven and came to this earth. While here, he lived a perfectly righteous life, only to take the punishment that We deserved. Our sinless creator became Our sin, and endured a gruesome death on a cross for our sake. Right before he died, he said \u2018it is finished\u2019.. meaning, the debt for our sins has been paid in full. And on the third day, he conquered death and rose from the grave. So now, we can go free from the wrath of God\u2019s judgement not by earning it, but rather, as a free gift of grace;<br><br>Except a gift can either be accepted or rejected..So this is what you must do in response; <br><br>Humbly admit to God that you have sinned against him, and through gratitude in the sacrifice of his son, repent (turn away) from your old way of life. Then, confess with your mouth that Jesus Christ is Lord, your savior, and the ruler of your life from this moment forward (Romans 10:9). <br><br>Do these things, and you will be saved.<br><br>If you sincerely do so, God will grant you a new heart which no longer finds comfort in sin. Also, he will grant you eternal life in his presence; The greatest pleasure on earth doesn\u2019t even come close to what God has in store for believers in the afterlife. <br><br>You\u2019ve been informed; Now the choice is yours. What you do with this information will determine where you spend ETERNITY, meaning, this is the single most critical decision you will EVER make; And all of us here, whether believer or atheist, know deep down that every last word here is true.<br><br>Jesus Christ is awaiting YOU this very moment; don\u2019t even think about sleeping tonight until you surrender your life to him, because your tomorrow isn\u2019t guaranteed..
