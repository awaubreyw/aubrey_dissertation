I&#39;d been a skeptic (and still am pretty skeptic) regarding all paranormal phenomena. One night I was unable to sleep because I had slept at noon, but it was still late and I had to get up the day after. I was at my step-grandma&#39;s house, in the living room&#39;s bed. There was a balcony, the doors to which were open, and in the middle of the room there was a table. Normal eastern european living room dining table. As I was fidgeting on my phone, trying to find sleep where there&#39;s none I hear this SLAP smack on the table. I immediately turn around, and nothing was there. I went out the balcony, street was completely empty. I went back in bed,  frankly not really worried because I was convinced if it was actually a ghost it was of my step-dad&#39;s father who at the time I remembered died in that room and frankly I had no reason to worry he had quarrel with me. So I turned my phone off and turned my back to the room which is when I felt it. A drumming, on the bedframe. 4 beats, drumming like someone impatient would. Frankly, I was bewildered, but even more than that excited because I finally encountered a ghost. That&#39;s gotta be some story to tell, especially since people knew me as a skeptic who would first follow through every logical possibility that would come to his mind. After a while I did manage to fall asleep, though it was pretty late and I just cancelled my next day plans so I could sleep in. <br><br>The next day I woke up near noon, rather poorly rested, went into the kitchen and had lunch for breakfast. Chatted a bit with that grandma, then I felt sleepy so I went back into my room and laid in bed, back to the wall. And I felt the regular breathing of someone fast asleep on the back of my neck. The only window was on the opposite side of the room, and the bed itself has a rather tall bedframe,  it reaches way higher than your head when you lay flat so it would be really unlikely the breathing was currents from the door. <br><br>Thing is, alone I could just chalk these phenomena up to something or other (though the table slap was so cllear it would be  a fair bit difficult to justify) , but all together it seems like a case of &quot;if you hear hoofbeats think horses&quot;. <br><br>I don&#39;t expect anyone to just up and believe me, and I do not mind potential explanations other than &quot;oh you were just tired,  your mind played tricks on you&quot; and that&#39;s that because frankly  those are non-arguments (not to mention that, again, I was quite restless and rested) and can be said about every paranormal phenomenon that doesn&#39;t happen in one&#39;s presence and direct observattion.

I looked at the wall on my right, tried to close my eyes one more time and suddenly I felt something pushed my left leg. I immediately turned towards it.

At first, I didn&#39;t get scared thinking it was my sister that came into my room, because I left the door open. As I tried to whisper her name, I realized it wasn&#39;t her. That genuinely gave me chills. I was paralyzed.<br><br>I had never seen this person before in my life. She was a bit taller and older than my sister, who was 8 at the time. The girl had medium, straight, black hair (and my sister&#39;s was very long). She had that classic diamond face shape, dark eyes, tiny nose and little mouth. She was wearing white pajamas.<br><br>She looked me in the eye and got a bit closer, then leaned towards me and smiled at me with a serene and cute look in her eyes. I know, it&#39;s really weird and creepy, but somehow that made me feel relieved. Then she stood up straight again went back a few steps and faded away like it was nothing.<br><br>I was astonished and still scared. I didn&#39;t sleep a single minute that night. In the morning, I couldn&#39;t stop thinking about it. I was repeating it over and over again in my mind.

For example, the sense of paranormal activity may be when an atom or molecule uses an ability to &quot;feel&quot; (or invoke some other action that is similar to the human definition of sensory detection and processing) negative space at a quantum level, and this in combination with an organism&#39;s natural sense of fear, self preservation, and situational conditioning gives organisms some action to sense what we humans would call &quot;ghosts&quot; and then react to those stimuli. This would be similar to the natural innate sense of fear and the innate knowledge and eventual acceptance of an organism dying or forming a new life cycle. <br>Under the theory of evolution, all organisms have technically originated from one source and would mean that there was a primitive chemical reaction / animo acid / protein / cell(s) that has died an indefinite amount of times yet simultaneously continued to grow, multiply, and mutate, thus live on. By technicality, every known organism may actuqlly be 1 single entity and our human/animal/organism sense of seperation and classification may also just be the side effect of our own sense of individuality that evolved during our primitive cell phase in search of self preservation. An example of this is the fact that we are multicellular creatures that are unable to &quot;feel&quot; the death of each cell individually, but if enough cells die within the vessel, &quot;we&quot; the individual will die as our cells decompose and break down into the basic elements. In turn, the origination of the paranoia of &quot;spirits, demons, and fae&quot; may be the atomic feeling of the seperation of the cosmic (and eventual sentient) thought from its physical mass. By this idea, we are individually each just a mass of conscious atoms, chemical reactions and energy. And if we are just these 3 things, there is no way to deny that negative space may be conscious as well (individually as many or systematically as one) since measuring the actions of the void of negative space is not completely technologically possible, yet. Thus all organisms, including ourselves, fall fear to the idea and illusion of the patterned order under a God or Absolute, regardless if the laws are found in a Bible or Science textbook. The God/Absolute Laws may just be our &quot;multi-comsic-ullar&quot; outer self (like if the universe and its lifeforma were to be compared to a person with their cells) and thus gives us the feeling of  &quot;ghosts&quot; and other spooks due to lack of sensory information of he remainder of the universe that is at our mortal disposal. This would mean that our &quot;ghosts&quot; are actually real and we just lack the technology to measure these forces. <br><br>But this is just a hypothesis. A GHOST hypothesis!

You laid out exactly how it can cause problems for people with existing issues, and by extension, it seems reasonable to think that it might CAUSE issues.

Caffeine sensitivity doesn&#39;t mean that caffeine is a super stimulant, but it is for those people.  Conversely, if you can DEFINITELY see the negative effects of EMF on some people, then it is probably causing negative effects on others that just don&#39;t manifest those symptoms as clearly.  You did mention this, but I feel like that is the exact issue with 5G.  <br><br><br>5G is going to be MUCH more intense of an EMF exposure than anything else that is currently out there, and it is going to be everywhere in urban areas.

That means people are going to be continuously bombarded by it if they live in an urban area.

When my grandfather was a toddler and began to speak, the family became aware that he counted one more family member in the house than everyone else did.  He encountered this extra family member only on the stairs, usually when coming down for breakfast.  This was an older man, who sometimes passed on advice for the family.  The family lived on a farm in Pennsylvania, and the &#39;ghost&#39; warned them once or twice that bad weather was on the way, and they needed to scramble to bring a crop in to avoid it being ruined.
