I did not know that there are neurotoxic aluminum and mercury molecules in vaccines. I did not know enough to research vaccines before vaccinating my own children. \r<br>I did not know that my own precocious, active, talking son would be vaccine-injured.

I did not know that my mother(an R.N.) would get 8 vaccines in 1 day to &quot;catch-up&quot; with newly added CDC vaccines to keep her job as Head Nurse in the Largest Hospital in the county and then get such severe, aggressive, progressive brain fog in days and become unable to dial a phone or push an elevator button or remember any of her  5 children in a few weeks and then have this &quot;dementia&quot; progress and then die in diapers\r<br>\r<br>I did not know that vaccines were given a blanket indemnity from liability in 1986 and now total immunity for all COVID vaccines for the future. I did not know that we gave more vaccines than any other country starting on day #1...I did not know that we have the highest rate of SIDS of the top 35 industrialized countries...

We are in the 5th month of this virus so I would assume that 1 million people will get the virus every month and those deaths will rise up to 600,000+ at the 1 year mark. Experts say this will go on for 2 years so we are going to see 1.2 million people die by the end of 2021 world wide. In 2016 we lost 3.0 million people world wide to lung cancer alone that doesn\u2019t include the other 1.7 million due to diabetes and 15 million dead due to hearth diseases and strokes.

Btw the bill Trump signed H.R.478 (4+7+9=19) was introduced to the House of Representatives back in 01/2019 they knew this outbreak was coming cause they planned the outbreak.

Also get this the Tanzania President John Magufuli secretly sent specimens from a fruit, quail, and goat to a lab testing for the COVID-19 coronavirus disease in humans \u2014 and the results came back positive.

You have to keep the virus hot for 48 hours straight to prevent it from replicating baby viruses, then when it dies in 2 days after it;s life cycle expires, no more viruses.

The far greater factor is direct sunlight. No known virus survives direct sunlight given enough exposure (less than the time from 10AM to 6 PM).    In addition, people outdoors are more inclined to maintain distance between each other - a break in the road the virus must use to travel from person to person, especially given the frequency of breezes above 3 MPH when we are outdoors.  You can be standing face to face at 2 feet talking to a person when there\u2019s a 3-10 mph breeze and neither person will be exposed to the virus - it literally blows away.  <br>RE: (2) \u201conly a small percentage of people in the U.S.  have been confirmed to have gotten COVID 19, the real total here is likely to be higher, maybe much higher. But even according to the biggest estimates, less than 5% of the population are likely to have been infected. So way more than 80% of the population is still susceptible. So, yes, it will be a while before we really know there\u2019s reason to think COVID 19 could become a seasonal affliction just like the flu. But even if it is, that won\u2019t likely give us the reprieve people are hoping for.  \u2026. there\u2019s still too much of the population that\u2019s still susceptible to the virus.\u201d   <br>With the above you  are calling into question the numbers published by the CDC and spread by news corporations in America.   Since March 16, the  number of people known to have caught this illness is less than 0.5% of our total population.     That means: success.  99.5% of the people have avoided this infection.   Even 95% uninfected over time is still success.   Yes, 99.5 % still susceptible but successful in avoiding infection, too.  All that\u2019s needed is for everyone to continue washing their hands (and using hand sanitizers) and maintaining a distance too great for the virus to travel.    On that we agree.  <br>RE: the world disrupting pandemic it is now.\u201d \u2014   Of course we have not addressed an important fact about this \u201cworld disrupting\u201d event. That is:  the disruption is intentional on the part of politicians who hold top offices in government.
