Two examples.  A species of clam that lives near me in Florida in the mud used to be randomly bright pink, light pink or white.  A parent could have all three in the hundreds every time they reproduce.   So if you were out collecting their shells you would be likely to see all three colors in equal amounts.  Shell crafters, people who make decorative objects from seashells often pick brightly colored shells to harvest as opposed to planer looking shells.  Shell crafting has been going on since the sailor&#39;s valentine craze of the Victorian era but it has grown to a wider scale here in Florida so much so that some county&#39;s ban harvesting live shells altogether.   So due to the popularity of brightly colored shells, the crafters would harvest only the pink ones leaving the white ones to survive to reproduce.   In 1979, as I said, the color demographics were more or less even.  Today, you will easily find the white ones but hardly ever will you find either of the pink shades.   A similar thing happened with it&#39;s distant cousin, another clam but that one comes in a huge variety of colors ranging from all white to every color of the rainbow and often many colors at once.  At least that was the case again 40 years ago but today, the demographics of that clam is roughly 80% white and 20% multi colored.  And like the other species, any parent can reproduce any of the colors and in fact will have a thousand offspring at a time and every color of the rainbow will be represented in one mass of eggs but mostly today you see white ones.   I predict that 2nd species of clam will be 96% White in 40 years and 99% white in 120 years and in a few more centuries, all color will be bred out of both species.   There is also a species of sea snail that when first discovered was up to 18&quot; long and quite heavy.  The snail would simply keep reproducing throughout it&#39;s life and just get bigger and bigger.  Due to harvesting preferences being for the largest display worthy specimens, you never see this species over a foot long any more.  But also this species tended to reproduce only after it reached 10 inches in length.  A malacologist once told me that they simply didn&#39;t reach sexual maturity until they were 10 inches long.  Prior to that any offspring would be deformed or sickly.   Recently I have observed specimens as small as six inches laying eggs and when I examined some under a microscope I found they were perfectly formed.  I saw one in a museum once that was 22 1/2 inches long.  It was accompanied by an egg case that was 2 1/2 inches thick.  The egg cases I see today are half an inch thick.  It&#39;s basically the same species but now I think we could call today&#39;s version a sub species, a sort of pigmy version of their ancestors.   To my knowledge no specimen of that species over 14 inches long has been seen alive since the 1970&#39;s.  All this said,  they are actually a very common species.  I could go out into the harbor near my house at low tide and there is a 75% chance I could fill a shopping bag with them in an hour.  Smaller specimens have little commercial value but the foot long or nearly foot long specimens sell for about $50 in souvenir shops.", "comment_date": "2022-08-02T11:28:30Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Arngeir", "comment_text": "Nah we don&#39;t have to change a thing, survival of the fittest, if some idiot animal species goes extinct because they can&#39;t adapt fast enough, tough.

The examples given DO NOT demonstrate any kind of EVOLUTION of one KIND becoming a completely different KIND, a dog remains a dog, a cat remains a cat and a snake remains a snake.  Yes, certain MUTATIONS (ie. &quot;MISTAKES&quot;) can make different MEMBERS within a particular KIND seem to change in outward appearance, but in most instances when a MUTATION occurs it is due to LOST INFORMATION in the genetic makeup of the individual which in most cases does not represent something positive, but demonstrates the LOSS of information not the introduction of new information; however, the animal or plant does NOT change from one KIND to a different KIND, the dog remains a dog, the cat remains a cat and the snake remains a snake.  To use these MUTATIONS as proof that EVOLUTION has occurred is pure BULLS**T and definitely cannot be claimed as SCIENCE!  In most cases, people want to believe in THE THEORY OF EVOLUTION so they can explain away the reality of the Creator of everything, GOD!  They claim to represent SCIENCE when in fact they are just replacing GOD with a twisted form of pseudoscience as their &quot;religion&quot;.  It has been PROVEN that there has never been discovered the fossil remains of one KIND changing into a completely different KIND over multiple thousands or even millions of years.  In fact, if you were to take the entire known expanse of the universe and fill it completely with objects the size of an electron with no space between them and then mark one of them and throw it out into the expanse and then blindfold someone and have them reach out and the first time pick out that marked electron and then multiple that number by 2 you might come close to the probability of something like EVOLUTION to have occurred at any time during the entire existence of the universe!  What most people aren&#39;t aware of is that there is a number in probability when something actually reaches the state of impossibility because we know that time is finite meaning that there is only so much time in the entire universe which has remained static since what the EVOLUTIONISTS call the &quot;big bang&quot; thus restricting random events to remain within that restricted amount of time.  There isn&#39;t enough time in the entire universe to allow RANDOM EVENTS and/or MUTATIONS to occur in one KIND to change it into a completely different KIND!  From the earliest period of mankind on earth up to the present there has NEVER been discovered one single &quot;transitional&quot; fossil that demonstrates one KIND changing into a completely different KIND!  Absolutely NO TRANSITIONAL FORMS exist that demonstrate THE THEORY OF EVOLUTION as being SCIENTIFICALLY valid!  If THE THEORY OF EVOLUTION were true, not just one TRANSITIONAL FORM would be found, but billions upon billions demonstrating one KIND changing into a completely different KIND.  Most if not all EVOLUTIONISTS believe that they are descendants of the apes, but if they choose to believe this then they will have to go much further back in time to find their true predecessors.  In fact they would have to go as far back as the chemicals leeched off the primordial rocks into the primordial pools of &quot;ooze&quot; that, according to them, created the basic components of life, thus your ancestors would actually be a bunch of random ROCKS!  I&#39;m pretty sure that you would be hard pressed to get an EVOLUTIONIST to agree that he was descended from a rock!  It has long been a proven fact in science that inorganic forms cannot give rise to organic forms of life.  Abiogenesis (ie. &quot;spontaneous generation&quot;) has been scientifically disproved for a long time now.  Life is far more complex than most people realize, even down the the simplest cell.  If you were to remove even one part of the mechanism that makes up the simplest cell it would cease to exist so please explain how you can create something as complex as a human being from a bunch of mistakes made over millions of years when the first time you miss inclusion of even the simplest component of even one cell, the organism ceases to exist?  If you are scholastically honest and approach science according to scientific method, you can never prove EVOLUTION!  It doesn&#39;t even make a SCIENTIFICALLY good THEORY!  What you can do is show the EVOLUTIONIST for who he really is, a hater of GOD who replaces the religion of the Bible with his religion of some twisted thing he calls SCIENCE!  It takes more FAITH to believe in a THEORY like EVOLUTION than it takes to believe in the God of the Bible!  The EVOLUTIONIST has just replaced the GOD of the Bible with his own FALSE &quot;god&quot; of some kind of voodoo magic called EVOLUTION!

You have an unknown specie that has been controlled by a more predatory/aggressive specie keeping its numbers small... well yes, once you eliminate almost all the competition you end up with an explosive growth of a once unknown specie that is considered a new discovery or an &#39;evolution&#39; of a less aggressive specie that now fills the vacuum left by the extinction or eradication of the previous aggressive specie that kept other species it fed on under control. \r<br>\r<br>That holds true for pesticides killing whole generations of mosquitoes... Surviving mosquitoes is called a form of natural selection, or resistance variation within a specie generation. Mosquitoes do not evolve against pesticides. There are only a few resistant mosquitoes within a generation of millions that survive a pesticide. Those go on to reproduce and become dominant. All others from the generation die. The cycle continues. Those new resistant generation are killed by a new pesticide, some survive and become a new dominant generation... on &amp; on it goes.

They then passed on those genetic traits to their offspring. So the latter generations had a high proportion of individuals with the advantageous trait. They then got to pass on their genes. It&#39;s just selection of an existing trait within a population. Take peppered moths for instance - the natural, pre-industrial Revolution population of moths had a fairly high proportion of light coloured to dark coloured individuals within the population. They would rest on the bark of light coloured trees. The dark moths stood out more than their light coloured brethren and were more easily seen by predatory birds, and were eaten. Dead moths don&#39;t reproduce. When the industrial Revolution occurred, a lot of soot was produced, which darkened the trees on which the moths rested. So now, the light coloured moths stood out against the background and were more heavily predated upon, with the dark coloured moths surviving to pass on their dark coloured genes. Thus you had a population shift from light coloured to dark coloured moths being the dominant form. No new information was required - just the selection of an advantageous existing trait. The same happens with fish, elephants and bacteria. If that population pressure continues - soon, only those with the advantageous trait survive in the local breeding population, and lose altogether the previous diversity of genetic variability available for passing on.

(4) In July 1947, I was stationed at Fort Worth Army Air Field [later Carswell Air Force Base] in Fort Worth, Texas. I served as Chief of Staff to Major General Roger Ramey, Commander, Eighth Air Force. I had the rank of Colonel. (5) In early July, I received a phone call from Maj. Gen. Clements McMullen, Deputy Commander, Strategic Air Command. He asked what we knew about the object which had been recovered outside Roswell, New Mexico, as reported in the press. I called Col. William Blanchard, Commander of the Roswell Army Air Field, and directed him to send the material in a sealed container to me at Fort Worth. I so informed Maj. Gen. McMullen. (6) After the plane from Roswell arrived with the material, I asked the Base Commander, Col. Al Clark, to take possession of the material and to personally transport it in a B-26 to Maj. Gen. McMullen in Washington, D.C. I notified Maj. Gen. McMullen, and he told me he would send the material by personal courier on his plane to Benjamin Chidlaw, Commanding General of the Air Material Command at Wright Field [later Wright Patterson AFB]. The entire operation was conducted under the strictest secrecy. (7) The material shown in the photographs taken in Maj. Gen. Ramey\u2019s office was a weather balloon. The weather balloon explanation for the material was a cover story to divert the attention of the press.

In this case, the swallows already had the genetic diversity for long and short wings. Evolution requires an increase in genetic diversity. An example of evolution, if it were real, would be if swallows only had genes for long wings, then developed a brand new gene by random mutation for short wings. Also the rationale for the success of the short-winged birds is wrong: long wings make for better maneuverability than short wings. \r<br>\r<br><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKB1dyXsTGM&amp;t=3m05s\">3:05</a> Sport fish: This is microevolution: change within a species. It is not macroevolution, which is the claim of evolutionists that species change their body forms, but which has no basis in reality. Even after shrinking or reducing their lifespan, the fish here all remain the same species. The same thing happened to horses introduce to Iceland: within one generation their descendants were significantly smaller, due to environmental pressure (much-reduced food supply). Were their descendants a different species? No. Also, the logic is false: they didn&#39;t evolve to be smaller on average because fishermen favoured larger fish; they were smaller on average because the larger fish were fished out. \r<br>\r<br><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKB1dyXsTGM&amp;t=4m29s\">4:29</a> Mosquitoes: A change of diet doesn&#39;t make the underground mosquitoes a different species. People move to new areas and change their diet. Lack of hibernation doesn&#39;t make for a new species; it&#39;s a behavioural adaptation to the climate-controlled environment. Not needing blood to lay eggs harkens back to creation when all animals fed on plants. The fact that they can&#39;t mate with other mosquitoes also doesn&#39;t necessarily make them a new species, because there is no solid definition of a species. Would an archaeologist consider them different species if he found one of each in amber? Tough call. They are still mosquitoes. They haven&#39;t changed body form, e.g. into wasps. No evolution here. \r<br>\r<br><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKB1dyXsTGM&amp;t=6m09s\">6:09</a> Sea snakes: This is adaptation within a species, not evolution (a change from one species to another). So they had the genetic variability to become black. Not a big deal; humanity as a whole has the genes for a little melanin or a lot.  People with a lot of melanin could cope with equatorial conditions; people with little melanin moved to temperate zones. \r<br>\r<br><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKB1dyXsTGM&amp;t=7m40s\">7:40</a> Ocean microbes: Full of BS. How do scientists know how much plastic is supposed to be in the ocean? Are they there to supervise each ship dumping garbage into the water? And if the patches aren&#39;t getting bigger, why are we screaming about turtles and banning plastic straws in Canada? Sounds like all is under control. And a change of diet does not make for a different species. Some Ideonella sakaiensis had a greater tolerance for plastic than others, and they flourished because of great supply. Most humans are lactose intolerant, but some can consume dairy, so they do. Same thing. \r<br>\r<br><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKB1dyXsTGM&amp;t=9m26s\">9:26</a> Butterflies: Where is the evolution here? The butterflies found a better food source, it disappeared, and they went extinct. Imagine North Americans losing their current food supply: would they go &quot;back&quot; to eating native vegetation, or would they starve? Exactly. Current generations don&#39;t even know what native vegetation is edible. \r<br>\r<br><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKB1dyXsTGM&amp;t=10m35s\">10:35</a> Elephants: No evolution here. Tuskless elephants are more common because of natural selection (or unnatural selection, in the case of human poaching, depending how you look at it). Tusklessness was in the elephants&#39; genome, and tuskless elephants became the norm because the ones that developed tusks got shot. Fine. They&#39;re still elephants, just with reduced genetic complexity as the genetics for tusks gets weeded out. A given breed of dog is a basic, &quot;original&quot; dog (probably a wolf-like ancestor), with some of the genetics weeded out.

This was not something that was voluntary, it was written in law to force farmers to use, in order to increase yields. Now they rewrote the law to make such fertilizer illegal, but farmers can&#39;t go back to other methods because the soil is dead. But instead of accepting this fact that it is too late, or make an alternative, governments have skipped straight to trying to seize land from farmers, even though they weren&#39;t the ones who wanted to use that fertilizer to begin with. It&#39;s what Dutch farmers are protesting currently.<br><br>The point is, all this talk about caring about the environment is useless if you won&#39;t look at who the ones ruining it actually are. The very same big name people pushing for &#39;environmental consciousness&#39; are the ones who were and are ruining the environment to begin with. But they want to blame us small people for their mistakes, and make us a scapegoat so that they can give themselves permission to continue controlling the future, and ruining the Earth further.", "comment_date": "2022-07-29T01:24:52Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Jack Burton", "comment_text": "Lost me at climate change /facepalm", "comment_date": "2022-07-29T01:00:52Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Tarson Talon", "comment_text": "Everyone talks about how many go extinct because of humans, nobody talks about how many species are created because humans.

The fish are smaller because over-fishing doesn&#39;t give them time to grow.  There is no predilection toward environmentally-motivated modification over time.<br>     Otherwise human beings, being cognizant of circumstance, would have developed gills for life underwater, wings for flight, prehensile tails for enhanced balance and stability, protective exoskeletons, internal temperature control, the ability to regenerate fingers or toes if not limbs, ....

We certainly had the time to grow fins, wings, and shells.  How did we &quot;evolve&quot; from stardust, through primordial sludge, through apes, to become superstitious, racist, hypocrites, WITHOUT ONE SINGLE ITEM in the superlative list of possibilities so naturally achieved by a bunch of stupid birds, fish, and crabs?

A hybrid bee that in the short span of only 50 years or so, evolved to hatch their queens one day before their European cousins.  Because of this, when an africanized colony takes over a European hive they will kill their queen first.  They will they quickly make a queen cell and lay an egg so even if the resident colony makes a queen cell and lays an egg at the very same time, the africanized queen will hatch first and she has an instinct that has her search for and kill the European queen still in her queen cell.  The bees will then usually accept the new queen and she will then lay very mean africanized bees that are very dangerous, for they protect their honey unlike any other bee specials.  Why?  Well because bees in Africa are unlike all other honey bee species in the world in that they only make a precise amount of honey that they use for food.  They don\u2019t require the colony to make an access of honey like other bees because they don\u2019t have winters like regular European honey bees experience which forces them to make 80% more honey than they actually need.  Many colonies make so much honey they could survive two winters back to back without ever gathering any other food stores.. A trait humans thousands of years ago recognized and is why humans and bees have such a quintessential symbiotic relationship.  Which is why when regular honey bees protect their hives they only send approximately 10% of their colony out to attack the aggressor.

The &#39;changes in the genes&#39; are chemical tagging changes, turnings genes on and off, or up and down that leaves the DNA sequences alone. This is evidence for intelligent design, not for evolution. \r<br>\r<br>As for being able to drink milk is from a gene getting stuck in the on-position. Again, not evidence of evolving DNA sequences by natural selection of beneficial mutations. \r<br>\r<br>What the deceived believers of evolution need to realize is there is a difference between effects from genome degradation and epigenetic-derived adaptations. The Darwin Finch is just ONE of the examples of this adaptation for their adapted beaks. The epigenome acts as a software program of a computer. There are FIVE information codes in every regular cell. At least four of five, have to have their molecules turned 100% right-handed...other ones left-handed. This would be like finding a billion quarters on a gymnasium floor all turned up heads with tails underneath. These complexities surpasses the threshold for mathematical impossibilities-by-chance.\r<br>\r<br>There are actual real adaptations that is observed to new diets, environments, or threats. These have been used as &#39;evidence&#39; for evolution to set itself up on 1st base and as a cornerstone for the sleight of hand by evolutionists for things like the macroevolution mind-constructs. These adaptations however comes from the built-in and pre-enabled biological system called the epigenome. All life has this. It uses chemical tags above the DNA sequence without producing DNA errors. This fits the intelligent design paradigm, not the Godless-spinned evolution. We are a creation. The Creator?

I would have sex with any girl, any time and anywhere. For so long I am not sure how many I have been with at this point. I had little to no morals nor cares about anything really. The only thing I held onto was my word as I was taught when I was a child, that a man is measured by his word and to keep your promises. So, IF I said I was going to do something, I did it no matter the cost. That being said, one night I awoke from my sleep. Sat up in my bed and vocally promised myself I was going to read the bible. Not sure why, to this day I still have no understanding as to why I made this my word. But I did, so I read.... and read and read more. Turns out the bible is a rather large book and it was taking me some time to do it. But I gave my word and I kept on reading it and as I read it the words where convicting my soul. I could feel something in my heart start to turn and became uneasy. Then one night, when I was asleep. I awoke to a presence in the hall at the end of my bed. I could see something was there but I was not able to see what it was. Then I heard a disgusting noise coming from it and I told it. \r<br>You&#39;re disgusting!!\r<br>\r<br>Then out of the silence, out of the darkness I heard.\r<br>\r<br>YOU\tARE\t       TO\r<br>\r<br>And it grabbed me.\r<br>\r<br>Then I awoke not knowing I was in a dream as the entire dream was where I was and how I was. &quot;Never had a dream like this before and never had another like it again.&quot; \r<br>The crazy part.... I still felt right where &quot;IT&quot; grabbed me, as if the tightness of its grip was still on me.\r<br>To say the least I have seen something that is not normal nor good.

It&#39;s epigenetic...ABOVE...the DNA sequences acting as a software program. It&#39;s has an intelligent design signature, not the Godless-spinned evolution of randomness and on-the-fly development. Can just gene expression modifications by chemical tagging cause huge appearance differences...and subtle ones? Look at the caterpillars and their resulting butterflies and moths after metamorphosis. Big structural change without any DNA sequence changes. In 2014, it was elucidated this same aspect gives the Darwin Finches their adaptations like different beaks by this epigenetics that has an intelligent design signature by its logistics...not the evolutionary theory&#39;s evolving of DNA mutations. Epigenetics have been found to do this with finches in just 17 years, not the theorized wrongly 2 million years. Even aspects of antibacterial resistance is epigenetic. No evolution! Evolution is not happening folks. We are a creation by Jesus Christ. Come on! Have anyone seen under-the-microscope evidence of any combination of &#39;building blocks of life&#39; bringing themselves in ANY bio-sophistication? No. Life is made up of millions, billions, and trillions of mathematically impossible-by-chance structures. This includes measurements and constants in physics and chemistry in their mathematical impossibilities-by-chance values. Being a creation is a cinch. ToE&#39;s many found-wrong precepts makes the evolution concept impossible.<br><br>Since Neanderthals are evolution-impertinent to us then there was no &#39;evolution&#39; of viruses. &#39;Evolution&#39; is misrepresentations of genome degeneration, aspects of gene expression and regulation, under-crediting the full ability of the epigenome of epigenetics in passing multigenerational  adaptations. It&#39;s made of a ridiculous assertion that genome degeneration causes evolutionary generation. What was the &#39;evidence&#39; for it? It was epigenetic adaptations with assumed evolving of DNA mutations but...epigenetic adaptations leave the DNA sequences alone in achieving it. The precept was wrong! Making the evolution concept IMPOSSIBLE. There&#39;s your science. Anyone like to science with me?

Selective adaption within a species is NOT evolution.  In the case of the mosquitos adapting so much they could no-longer breed with unadapted ones, this is an outdated definition of species.  It has been found some species, widespread over a continental scale can all breed with the adjacent group but not with groups at opposite ends of the species range. This is fairly well known in Grey Kangaroos for example &amp; they are still regarded as one species.  The mosquito example sounds extreme but the concept of species can not be defined by the ability to breed anymore as there are so many cases where that definition breaks down.  The human construct of species has become rather arbitrary IMO.  You need to go at least to the order level before you definitively have evolution. You can&#39;t even use chromosome count, otherwise down syndrome people would be considered not human and that is clearly not an acceptable view.  Below order, variations are pretty much just promoting or rejecting existing genetic variation through selectivity (natural selection or selective breeding).  While selectivity is hypothesised as a possible mechanism. It is not confirmed by actual observed, only hypothesized from the fossil record.  Therefore it is not a fact no matter how convinced one may be.  That&#39;s how science works, recorded observations are facts, conclusions are not.  The best we can say is that based on the evidence, we think the most likely explanation is..........  The reason I am doing this rant is that IMO a lot of people over step the mark on what is conclusively known and I think science should be done scientifically &amp; not by popular opinion.<br><br>Oh by the way, longer wings (with the same body weight and wing chord) are not faster, they are slower because L = 1/2 . p . V^2 . S . Cl so V = (2 . L /( p . S . Cl ))^(1/2).  Therefore, reducing wing area &quot;S&quot; yields a higher velocity (airspeed).  Shorter wings leads to higher induced drag winch simply changes the L/D ratio which is a measure of efficiency.  This effects gliding range and rate of descent, not air speed.  Air speed is determined by the ability to generate enough lift to counteract weight &amp; thereby maintain level flight.<br><br>Some birds particularly ocean birds that rely on dynamic soaring in high winds and are not behaviourally tied to a limited geographic range, have high body weights and very narrow long (low area) wings.  As weight/area is high, they achieve very high air speeds.  Their narrow long wings give low induced drag, high lift/drag ratios performance that gives them an efficient shallow, long range gliding performance.  But, this is not the case in the example given in the video.  I suspect this example has been inappropriately transferred to the case in the video.<br><br>The point is that while holding other parameters fixed, reducing wing area, either by reducing wing chord or by reducing length, results in increased wing loading which increases airspeed for flight.", "comment_date": "2021-06-11T00:05:45Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Mozart's Ghost", "comment_text": "lol climate change is 100% our fault? might wanna go back and do some more research on that one.", "comment_date": "2021-06-10T21:51:13Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Too Many Lies", "comment_text": "Fascinating.", "comment_date": "2021-06-10T19:44:50Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Abdullah Alhashmi", "comment_text": "And then I started evolving", "comment_date": "2021-06-10T15:35:44Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "DarkHorse Gaming", "comment_text": "Climate change is not 100% our fault.

The cane toad populations that are found further West display features that would be beneficial in travelling the large distances required to reach a new habitat before it becomes saturated with members of their own species. They are significantly larger than the parent species and also have comparatively longer legs. Basically, this invading species has adapted traits that serve well for the vanguard simply reaching a new destination first and dominating the region before the smaller and shorter legged competitors arrive.<br><br>Additionally, native species that live in areas which have become inhabited by cane toads have also evolved to accommodate their presence. The Australian Red-Bellied Black Snake has evolved a smaller head because those with large enough jaws to ingest a poisonous adult toad died very quickly after doing so. Also, several species of Australian bird have developed a preference for flipping toads onto their backs and eating the non-poisonous parts of the toad. While this was initially believe to be a learned behavior, birds that are raised in captivity and never see other birds doing this do now seem to instinctively go for the underside of toads when encountering them for the first time.", "comment_date": "2021-05-12T22:43:18Z", "likes_count": 280}, {"comment_by": "PShawtx", "comment_text": "They are confusing evolution with adapting.

The naturalists noticed that the moths, which spent significant time perching on tree-trunks, were harder to see on the trunks, as the tree-trunks were, in many areas, darker due to soot from large numbers of nearby furnaces.  This made it harder for birds that preyed on them, to spot them.  So the species had originally been a lighter gray, as that made it harder to spotted by the predacious birds, but selective pressure had previously mitigated against the darker ones, as standing out on the lighter (earlier) tree-barks.", "comment_date": "2020-11-03T06:44:56Z", "likes_count": 65}, {"comment_by": "Jim Gilligan", "comment_text": "Include climate change in your presentation but please omit the Anthropogenic form as a cause because climate change has been occurring since the earth formed and life began.

She had a large iguana on her roof, and many smaller lizards that lived inside and around the house that occasionally made an appearance. Finally, after living with the horrible paint scheme for many years, she convinced the landlord to let her paint the house other colors. When she did, she noticed a lot more small lizards \u2014 since they were all hot pink! The lizards had evolved to be pink to blend in better with the pink walls, so they wouldn\u2019t be eaten by the iguana.

All animals have good designs which work. Most cars have 4 wheels. It\u2019s a good design, so it works. That does not prove that cars are related.

Compared to an Oreo cookie or a sugar cookie. Some parts might have a large chunk of chocolate chip in them, others might not, but you can still tell which original cookie each chunk belongs to.

If the recent scientific findings that show carbon-14 testing results are skewed because of the excessive carbon 12 that is being released into the atmosphere by the burning of fossil fuels, which we have done for over a hundred fifty years, what does that say about carbon dating itself, since it has only been around for 70 years? How has it not been skewed since the inception of radiometric dating if we&#39;ve been releasing excessive amounts of carbon 12 into the atmosphere for a hundred years prior to carbon dating being used? These are serious Theory holds that need to be addressed and not shrugged off. A lot of things aren&#39;t gelling calculating correctly. <br><br>Is there going to try and claim another rapid change in evolutionary process rate, and even more try to pin it on us as the reason, they need to be coming up with more than educated guesses.

An organism has a great deal of extra genetic information which ONLY comes into use if that creature experiences certain environmental pressures.  Until and unless that happens, those genes are useless and just extra weight.  So how did epigenetic coding come about?  If evolution is survival of the fittest how do you evolve some you only MIGHT need hundreds of generations down the line, but is of no immediate benefit?<br><br>That is not how evolution is supposed to work.  However, that is what one would expect of a wise and loving Creator.  Such a designer could anticipate future needs and environmental stresses such that in a &quot;use in or lose it&quot; way one can lose unneeded traits and have a handy toolkit to adapt to the foods and environment one experiences and pass done such useful genetics to descendants.  Never really a change of magnitude though.  Never enough to become a different Kind of creature, just better suited to your niche and resilient to disease or other stressors.<br><br>Take a survival back pack for example.  Pretty much useless to you unless you get into that survival situation.  Just a heavy, resource hogging waste till then.  When you suddenly need it, you don&#39;t have time to go buy those supplies or evolve them.  You have to have them BEFORE you need them.  That is not how evolution could work.  And yet a great deal of epigenetic coding exists.  This is evidence of a wise planner.  One does not just fall out of a plane and say &quot;Oh look, what do you know?  I have a parachute.

I counter that those who are predisposed to believe in evolution tend to want to claim everything is proof of evolution.  If you claim I have bias, then they also have bias the other way.  It is best to be objective.<br><br>The claim is made that if microevolution is true, then this will eventually lead to macroevolution.  Breeding experiments have been carried out for decades, over hundreds and even thousands of generations on fruit flies, micro-organisms and plants.  It has been found that there is a limit to how much they can change.  It is always within what was already genetically present in the organism.  They never become something other than fruit flies or Staphylococcus or whatever they started out with.  The expression by the Creator that creatures reproduce &quot;according to their kinds&quot; (roughly equivalent to classification &quot;Family&quot; appears proven to be true.<br><br>My contention is that though proponents like to call it microevolution it isn&#39;t actually evolution, because no innovations have occurred, merely breeding.  In the illustration I gave before where someone kills everyone without red hair, in a couple generations should a researcher come through and say, &quot;Wow, what an example of amazingly rapid evolution!  Practically the whole population has red hair now.&quot;  Yeah sure, there has been a genetic shift in allele frequencies, but they haven&#39;t ACTUALLY changed significantly.  It is just a cosmetic difference that was already present. <br><br>In my view, how wonderful that our Creator kindly crammed a bunch of potential genetic diversity in every Kind of organism.  Thus we can have many types of dogs, of cats, horses, people, roses, bananas, corn, etc.  This provides enjoyable variety in taste, color, size, resiliency, etc.  Most changes are just cosmetic.  Having different races of human is excellent, but it is mostly all just surface features that vary.  Their internal organs and cells (the important stuff) pretty much works the same way.<br><br>For evolution to be true, it would have to produce NEW strings of genetic code.  There are countless fantastic innovations.  The eye, ear, lungs, blood, clotting ability, stages of reproduction, stages of digestion, peristalsis, numerous sphincters, so many wondrous functions we take for granted until they don&#39;t work (often because a mutation bad enough to be called a genetic disease threw a spanner in the works.)<br><br>So no, I don&#39;t consider so-called microevolution to ACTUALLY be evolution.  Not just because of my potential bias, but because it isn&#39;t enough to produce new abilities, which is what evolution is supposed to be able to do eventually.  I know the difference between a merry-go-round and a train.  Also, a paint job doesn&#39;t make an existing house a new one.  It just a &quot;bait and switch&quot; con.  Say some truth to get someone agreeing with you and then blur the lines to an unwarranted conclusion. <br><br>Microevolution does not lead to macroevolution and thus really isn&#39;t proof of evolution at all.<br><a href=\"https://www.jw.org/en/bible-teachings/science/\">https://www.jw.org/en/bible-teachings/science/</a>", "comment_date": "2019-12-24T17:30:56Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "KURTlikesSTUFF", "comment_text": "London Underground mosquitoes sounds like an indie band", "comment_date": "2019-12-24T17:18:12Z", "likes_count": 4551}, {"comment_by": "kwitchabichen", "comment_text": "Warnings before you show trash.

None of them actually showed NEW capabilities coming as a result of accidental genetic change.  They were all simply attributes which the creatures already had and were within their existing range of genetic diversity.  There can be a bit of natural selection of EXISTING traits, but it&#39;s all around a mean or average.  Take the cliff swallows, for example.  Some already HAD short wings.  Nothing NEW came into being.  If the conditions changed they would revert back.  They are just oscillating around a mean.  They are not actually GOING anywhere or truly changing or improving.<br><br><br>In no case did they become another new type of creature.  Cliff swallows were still cliff swallows, etc.  Elephants were still elephants.<br>It is a wonderful design to allow variety within a family of creatures.  This keeps them from all being wiped out by a particular adversity.  Variations in size, color and so forth are pleasant to enjoy and also allow resilience.<br><br><br>It has been discovered (and even discussed on Sci-Show) that there is such a thing as Epigenetics.  Creatures have a great deal of extra genetic coding ALREADY existing within there genome and ready to respond to environmental stimuli.  Thus, they do not need a NEW mutation giving them some new ability (as if random single point mutations could actually do that.)  Fully functioning long strings of code already exist to help adapt within a predetermined range.  I watched a different video showing that even consuming plastic was within the EXISTING capabilities of certain bacteria since it wasn&#39;t that different from something they already were capable of consuming.  (They put some micro-organism which they knew had never interacted with plastics and a sub-set were able to consume it.)<br><br><br>I consider the concept that if the genetics shifts a little at all, even within existing traits, that this means evolution has occurred.  That is a very wussy, grasp at straws version of evolution.  If all variety in life came about by evolution, then evolution has to actually introduce new traits by means of new genetic coding.  Not simple going round and round in a circle of pre-existing genetics.  You&#39;ve got to code something NEW or you aren&#39;t actually something new.  Slightly shorter wings is simple existing genes being expressed a little less.  No new coding required.  A mutation which keeps an elephant from being able to grow tusks is a LOSS of information, not anything new.<br><br><br>Let me illustrate what I mean.  If some psychopath killed everyone in a community who didn&#39;t have red hair and in future generations red hair was much more common, was that evolution?  That is pretty much what most of the 7 examples presenting in the video amounted to.  Some outside force killing those that didn&#39;t have a certain existing trait.  My whole point is genetic information was LOST, not gained.  That&#39;s not really an example of evolution, just variety within a group and maybe de-evolution if anything, since variety was lost.<br><br><br><br>Enough rant for now.

And that these better fed birds make it longer in the wild regardless of the weather?<br><br>Moving on to the elephants.<br>Tusk-less elephants already existed before human meddling and in this case blaming human activity is totally justified. It can also be argued that this isn&#39;t really evolution as the trait lived on in the species before human intervention. Humans do kill the elephants with tusks and tusk-less elephants survived simply because humans let them be. While yes this can fit the definition of evolution what is really happening to most elephants is more closely related to eugenics.<br><br>Humans directly killing these animals is an environmental pressure fitting the definition of evolution but the rapid change is caused by a very unnatural direct selection process. We are not changing their environment this change isn&#39;t happening over many human or in this case elephant generations and human hunting has a very obvious cause and effect to the animals phenotype namely humans are the reason elephants have no tusks. Any other changes to this animal species have not been observed having no tusks is the only obvious point of differentiation<br><br>Just like with the birds we do see a difference but unlike in the birds whose wings are a little shorter we know why these elephants are being born without tusks and we don&#39;t know why the birds wings are getting shorter. The guess is to avoid cars, but humans cannot prove that. It&#39;s certainly possible other swallows died far away from a road trying to catch food without and starved to death without our knowledge and since these animals live under bridges and some live above other roads (in underpasses) there&#39;s quite obvious reasons why fledglings may wind up as roadkill. They can fall out of the nest or die trying to fly for their first time. Since we don&#39;t see the dead bodies outside of the areas over roads I guess we just assume it&#39;s all our cars fault now instead of actually looking for other dead bodies away from any roadway where we expect them to live away from human structures. The way I see it here is that in this case we inadvertently created homes for these birds whose population has also exploded I might add.<br><br>Basically life will find a way unless some force deliberately targets a species for destruction or an animal&#39;s habitat is destroyed or food moves away or dies.<br><br>The problem I have here is blaming calling this kind of evolutionary pressure on people when it isn&#39;t or on climate change which is believed to be driven by people when the evidence indicates we&#39;re not capable of destroying any habitat via CO2 emissions.<br><br>If you want to blame pesticides, solid/liquid runoff waste and diesel exhaust particulate matter all of which are also byproducts of human activity that hamper, change or outroght damage local ecology I&#39;d back your arguments up, but no one ever seems to want to do that.", "comment_date": "2019-12-23T04:36:21Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Brad Hill", "comment_text": "hold up, melanin binds with heavy metals? that&#39;s... genetically intriguing", "comment_date": "2019-12-23T04:24:47Z", "likes_count": 4}, {"comment_by": "CyberiusT", "comment_text": "~<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKB1dyXsTGM&amp;t=5m36s\">5:36</a>: &quot;The two types [of mosquito] are now so genetically distinct that they can&#39;t mate and produce offspring&quot;; and then:<br>~<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKB1dyXsTGM&amp;t=5m41s\">5:41</a>: &quot;The Metro mosquitoes are arguably a new species, not just a subspecies.&quot;<br>I thought hat not being able to crossbreed was pretty much the definition of a different species.
