Reverse cancer with electricity? Cancer is genetic mutation, it&#39;s not possible to reverse DNA damage that way, the best you can do is to suppress cancerous tissue more than healthy tissue - which probably is what happened in the experiments, but in most real situations I doubt it would do much more than slow down cancer somewhat.<br>I didn&#39;t really hear what mechanism this could theoretically use to help the body fight cancer. Just slowing it down is not enough, it will just relapse, the DNA damage is still there and the cells are not killed.<br>Furthermore, what mechanism can possibly be used to somewhat-consistently inject photoactive genes into tissues of live people? And then how to remove them if the treatment is ever successful?<br>Chemotherapy is mostly to kill off and suppress cancer that cannot be easily separated from healthy tissue, this therapy is unlikely to ever replace that because blasting ions indescriminately will, as mentioioned, negatively affect all muscles and nerves, primarily heart, but also stomach, mobility, and all other ones, and for targeted this will not replace radiation or local chemo since it cannot discriminately kill the cancerous cells, just suppress them at best.<br>By the way, cancer is not one thing, every cancer is different, and although there are similarities, I serously doubt all or almost all cancers behave same way in this regard, which should be at least mentioned.<br>Although the research itself is interesting, as of now applications are unclear at best, suggesting otherwise is fake news.", "comment_date": "2020-09-06T20:06:15Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Freedomcat", "comment_text": "That is basically reiki/chi/ki healing.

I was hurt and depressed so I was too curious and wanted to try Dr IFA, , then i contacted him through his email when i contact him, he assured me 100% that he will heal me, i pleaded with him to help me out. My treatment was a great success, he healed me just as he promised. he sent me his medication and ask me to go for check up after one weeks of taking the medication. i agreed with him i took this medication and went for check up, to my greatest surprise my result was negative after the treatment, i am really happy that i am cured and healthy again.. I have waited for 3weeks to be very sure i was completely healed before writing this testimony.... I did another blood test one week ago and it was still Herpes negative., ,,so i guess it time i recommend anyone going through Herpes HSV-1 or HSV-2, HIV, HPV,Hepatitis B,, Diabetes, ex back,Cancer, Syphilis reach him through Email drifahome@<a href=\"http://gmail.com/\">gmail.com</a> OR add on whatsapp +2349054764719 DOCTOR WEBSITE;<a href=\"https://drifahomecentre.jimdosite.com/\">https://drifahomecentre.jimdosite.com</a>", "comment_date": "2020-09-04T09:29:40Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Jack v", "comment_text": "Some have a very strong command of their bio electromagnetic energy that they can actually direct that energy through almost any part of their body and it feels like a tingling sensation similar to that which you get when you&#39;re having a powerful moment or when you watch a scary movie and you&#39;re getting up to that the scene where something&#39;s going to happen that is very explosive oh, do you understand where I&#39;m coming from so far? LOL or do I sound crazy oh, I&#39;m going to sound crazy a little bit later on in this comment probably LOL I can tell you beyond the shadow of any doubt that I have control in the ability to direct my by electric current to almost any part of my vital organs and at will most of the time. I just looked up the search term bioelectric energy cures cancer and I came up with this video LOL. All yes most definitely so and when you tell yourself something and you are in command of something very powerful you can kill off any cancer that is growing provided you are able to harness this internal energy flow. You can test the resistance of that energy with a simple voltmeter, attach the positive and negative end to each temp temple of your head and then muster up the energy or trying to force that energy out, if your new out of you don&#39;t understand it think of it as like you&#39;re trying to pass gas oh, and then look at the metre and lo and behold you will see the values on that metre oh, I&#39;ve experimented with both young and old and it seems as though the very young are able to effortlessly move the needle or change the values on a digital voltmeter very easily older people Thunder to have a more difficult time or not able to move the metre at all except for one older person who was able to move the analog Needle on the voltmeter. now I don&#39;t know what that means yet, Perhaps is calcification of the body or some sort of environmental toxin or some accumulation of something that prevents the proper electrical conductivity in the body and that&#39;s because children are young they are not so exposed to this could be fluoride could be one of various reasons and I do not think it would be very difficult to find out what prohibits or lessens the body&#39;s electrical flow. So good luck, and perhaps use some powerful music anything that will get but sensation going where your hairs are standing on end it is essentially a sort of something like that an aspect of it and that you can eventually begin to take command of it well good luck everyone", "comment_date": "2020-09-04T04:00:28Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "lizard", "comment_text": "I want to know who you watch on Twitch!", "comment_date": "2020-09-04T00:45:45Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "oa127", "comment_text": "Reminds me of my own experiments to remove moles on my leg back in the 90&#39;s.
