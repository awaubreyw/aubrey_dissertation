Their smell makes me want to cuddle them, and protect them, and wistfully wish I had been a father.<br><br>For childhood memories, I recall Georgia pines, and some sort of odor that was in the fog of Warner Robbins, GA, early 1970s, that reminded me of ham. No idea what that was. Old books smell a bit like vanilla, which is a component of all of my favourite colognes, including Coty&#39;s &quot;Raw Vanilla,&quot; and Polo &quot;Green,&quot; which also has two of my other favourite scents, lime oil, and cedar oil. Genuine rose oil is also a favourite. Meanwhile, I can&#39;t smell musk. Musk colognes, along with carnations, just smell like plastic to me. Strangely, because of a vinyl-coated crib bumper pad, the smell of vinyl relaxes me, making me want to sleep.<br><br>As for the smell of sweat, women&#39;s sweat makes me want to vomit, and my dad&#39;s was just gross, but other men&#39;s is extremely attracting. I&#39;m not talking like unwashed homeless cumin sweat. That&#39;s gross. I&#39;m talking gym workout with having showered that morning sweat. Men who wash that off or cover that up are less attractive. It&#39;s best when mixed with some of the other favourite odors. Work sweat with cedar, lime, and vanilla, is perfect. Meanwhile, thankfully, as someone getting older, I have an Asian allele that cause my sebaceous secretions to have less oil, so I should have less Nonenal. Yay?
