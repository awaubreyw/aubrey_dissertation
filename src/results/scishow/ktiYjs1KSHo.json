I was in one car crash in my life.<br><br>1.  I don&#39;t drive.  And I had rarely been in cars for a few years as I was living in London.  But in the early &#39;90s, a group of us went to visit friends in the countryside.  I only say this to suggest that I couldn&#39;t have picked up anything from the feeling of the car to have known something was wrong.<br><br>2.  I was in the back corner seat and had turned towards the person in the middle as we were talking.  This means that I wasn&#39;t looking out of the front window.  I was just looking at this girl&#39;s face and there was a 3rd person in the backseat behind the girl so I wasn&#39;t looking out of the back door window either.<br><br>I was talking and then time suddenly slowed.  I remember thinking &quot;Why on earth has time suddenly gone really slow.&quot;<br><br>A bit after I thought that, as I was trying to work out why time had slowed, I felt the car begin to lose control {going round a bend} and then swerve and we went into the ditch.<br><br>All this was still in slo-mo.<br><br>And it now sort of made sense that it was.<br><br>It wasn&#39;t really dangerous.  The car wasn&#39;t going above the speed limit and the ditch was only perhaps 3 foot deep.  None of the 5 of us were harmed.  Not even any cuts or bruises.<br><br>But I 100% know I thought &#39;Hang on, why has time suddenly really slowed down&#39; from before there was any indication there was anything wrong {when I was in mid conversation} until we nose dived into the ditch and stopped moving.<br><br>Once we&#39;d made sure everyone was fine, I told everyone about the time going slow straight away and had been known to happen sometimes.<br><br>So it clearly wasn&#39;t me remembering it as that afterwards.<br><br>{And ftr, I was several years later in a minor plane crash.  A plane was taking off from Bogota airport, accelerated and when it put the flaps down for take-off, the flap on my side fell off the wing.  I smashed into the seat in front - we all did - and that was scary as it screeched to on the brakes.  But that wasn&#39;t slomo.  It was just normal.  First I knew about it was when I slammed into the seat in front of me.  Then I did have a bit of pain and was just worried about getting back home safely.}<br><br>So if it was memory, why wouldn&#39;t I have remembered that as slomo?  That experience, of time going suddenly going really slowly and not having a clue why and trying to work it out is not something one could have imagined without experiencing it.  Trust me.<br><br>About a decade ago there was a series on BBC with the Oxford Maths professor Marcus du Sautnoy.  One experiment made him say his mind was completely blown and he didn&#39;t know what was going on with reality any more.<br><br>At one of the top London colleges, he was made to lie down on his back with two electrodes - one in each side of the lower back of his head.  He was given two thumb button pressers, one for each hand.<br><br>He had to relax and look at the screen, and at random intervals, the word &#39;Choose&#39; would appear on the screen, and when it did, and not before, he was to choose to press the left or the right button.<br><br>1.  The electrodes in the back of his brain got which one he would pick right every single time.<br>2.  But 7 seconds before the word appeared on the screen.<br>3.  Which also meant that, given the timing between the word appearing was random, his subconscious also knew 7 seconds before the word appeared that it was going to appear in 7 seconds time.<br>4.  So while he&#39;s lying there, not knowing when the word will appear, nor which way he&#39;ll choose, his subconscious knew 7 seconds before hand.<br>5.  Every single time.<br><br>Now remember, this wasn&#39;t some youtube spoof.  <br><br>This is a BBC science documentary presented by an Oxford professor, a Fellow of the Royal Society (FRS),  the current holder of the Simonyi Professorship for the Public Understanding of Science who has been a fellow of 3 different Oxford colleges..<br><br>And he said after he had finished the experiment that he no longer knew what was going on with reality.  That it made him doubt time and free will.  <br><br>His brain had predicted when a random future event would occur.<br>And had predicted what he thought was his own free will choice.<br>7 seconds before hand.<br>Every time.<br><br>So if that can happen, is it not possible that in the car crash, my brain also knew the future and slowed down time in preparation?<br><br>As I say, all I know is that:<br>I noticed time had slowed down and was wondering why.<br>That this started before there was any reason for me to suspect anything was wrong - hence my surprise.<br>That while it seemed at the time like a good half minute or more, it was probably only a matter of seconds in real life given we could see the tyre marks and it had started before that.<br><br>Anyone got any thoughts on this?<br><br><br>Actually, there was one other time where things slower only with hindsight.  In 2001, I was watching an Arsenal CL game in the upper tier of the North Bank at the old Highbury stadium.  2-1 up against Juventus with 4 minutes of normal time to go.  Bergkamp got the ball on the edge of their box, and with 2 defenders around him, he drags the ball this way and that for about 5 touches.  Another defender arrives and he keeps dragging the ball around under his boot, twisting and turning, before flicking it through for a run of Freddie Llunjberg who finishes first time.<br><br>I hadn&#39;t seen Freddie&#39;s run as I&#39;d just been staring at the ball.  Time didn&#39;t seem to be slow, it all felt normal, but I thought Bergkamp had had the ball at his feet for a good 20-30 secs.  It was only when I watched the goal again on Youtube almost a decade later that I saw, much to my surprise, that Bergy had the ball for maybe 6-7 secs.  I was thoroughly shocked.<br><br>Now that could just be memory, or perhaps a subconscious memory of watching a slomo replay on the big screen.  But as I say, it didn&#39;t seem slow at the time.  It just seemed speeded up compared to my memory when I watched it many years later on youtube.<br><br>But the car crash, with me thinking &#39;why has everything gone slow?&#39; before anything went wrong shows to me that it really did slow down.<br><br>And the time it would have taken in real life, as opposed to the slo-mo I was in, would fit that evidence of the BBC doc where our subconscious seems to know the future 7 seconds before it happens.<br><br>There&#39;s a lot to think about in this.", "comment_date": "2018-07-25T09:48:19Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Keaton Belliston", "comment_text": "When I was t-boned by a drunk driver, all I could think about was how everything turned grayscale for that second.
