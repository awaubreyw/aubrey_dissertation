Cases like Denhama aussa (an Australian stick insect) are even worse. Again, an Austrian (not Austr-al-ian) researcher was trying hard to classify the Australian stick insects, and when he finally got the first one right, he was calling out in his Austrian accent: &quot;Den hamma aussa!&quot; (&quot;We got him right!&quot;), and the name stuck.<br>And who ever thought that the definition of a genus like &quot;lifeforms looking similar to each other and having fertile offspring, which also looks similar&quot; is universal or at least works for the most common lifeforms, never looked at the actual way the Common Dandelion (Taraxacum sect.

They even trace the forks in the evolutionary tree back billions of years from looking at the distribution of genes across species now, and even use the retroviruses in our own genomes to trace back the millions of years since they infected a common ancestor. I do not have a clue how they do this, but you might like to look into it.<br><br>The &#39;Small Things Considered&#39; blog might put you in touch with experts who can explain the modern &#39;tree of life&#39;. It consists mostly of microbes by a long long way--though if you lined up the bacteriophage in the seas end to end, the line would reach light years! Vincent Racaniello&#39;s YT virus lecture course will tell you about that!<br><br>In the micro world, it seems that whole new phyla are being added faster than new macro species are being discovered. The &#39;Tree&#39; is more like a spread out bunch of keys on a giant key ring now, with the shaft of each key being a phylum in its own right. You have to look quite hard to see the one that includes multicellular things and leads eventually to us!<br><br>As to &#39;describing&#39; new species: this is difficult because most species cannot be cultivated in the lab. DNA is just extracted from the environment now, and, as everything alive is constantly shedding DNA, species can be known from their DNA long before anyone. Ever finds the creature it comes from! On the other hand, this environmental DNA can help decide whether a known species is still hiding somewhere and not extinct after all.<br><br>I&#39;d guess, however, that some species we &#39;discover&#39; from eDNA now might actually come from creatures that have been extinct for a long time, but they are only just thawing out and being washed into rivers and seas with the melting of permafrost.

First, remember that phyla are, in some fundamental ways, arbitrary. The entire concept was devised, not to reflect evolution, but rather to organize our thinking on biology. As such, there&#39;s no reason to assume that they have anything to do with evolution; evolutionary thought is grafted onto taxonomy, often surprisingly crudely. Many (most?) phyla were developed prior to paleontology being firmly established, and reflect the modern world, NOT the history of life. Second, there is no reason to assume that phyla SHOULD have the same amount of diversity. However we define phyla, there&#39;s a good chance that the amount of genetic diversity within them is significant. I don&#39;t know of anyone who uses the ability of a taxon to diversify as a character, but it&#39;s one that may very well be a significant one--ammonites and forams both show a surprising amount of diversity, while some taxa seem to remain stagnant for a very long time. <br><br>Personally I like the idea of defining phyla by focusing on bauplans, but that has flaws as well. Arthropoda is often argued to be a polyphyletic group, because &quot;segmented thing with a shell&quot; is a pretty easy bauplan to evolve, and there are significant differences between members of Arthropoda which suggest different origins. <br><br>I also note that you don&#39;t get into the more significant problems. For example: there are multiple definitions of &quot;species&quot;. How do you define species if the clade you&#39;re working with reproduces asexually? Can&#39;t use genetic isolation! There&#39;s also the assumption that species are genetically isolated from one another, which turns out not to be the case--hybridization can occur in many organisms, and horizontal gene transfer (such as between parasite and host) is also common. And what do you do with a chronospecies, such as bison? Or bacteria, which can exchange genetic information almost at will? The reality is that the biological species concept, which is what taxonomy was based on and which most phylogenetic and cladistic studies assume, only works (sort of) with a limited range of sexually reproducing animals. Genetics? Okay--which genes? Because no one uses the entire genome. Plus you miss out on the vast majority of biological history, since genetic information is not preserved for long in the fossil record. Morphology? That&#39;s the de facto default, but five minutes&#39; thought demonstrates the flaws therein. <br><br><br>For my part, I think we need to embrace the fact that biology is messy. It&#39;s not going to be neat and orderly like physics or chemistry; biology is a series of exceptions with just enough rules to keep it from completely falling apart. Attempting to redefine the rules to minimize the exceptions misses a very fundamental point about biology: it adapts, constantly, and at all levels, from individual proteins to entire ecosystems.", "comment_date": "2020-02-20T00:47:42Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "elaztic", "comment_text": "This went over my head.<br><br> I&#39;m still adding it to my Pinterest.", "comment_date": "2020-02-20T00:46:37Z", "likes_count": 2}, {"comment_by": "Kamil Majewski", "comment_text": "The way we learned this in biology (as in one of the other students thought of this) was King Philip came on Freddy&#39;s giant schlong.<br><br> We heard it once, bursed out laughing and none of us have forgotten it since.", "comment_date": "2020-02-20T00:45:22Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "a wingless monkey", "comment_text": "You&#39;d think lizards and turtles would be considered their own orders at this point.  &quot;Reptiles&quot; should be a supra-order, if we&#39;re going to bother keeping the old ranks at all.", "comment_date": "2020-02-20T00:44:16Z", "likes_count": 147}, {"comment_by": "Johan Habben Jansen", "comment_text": "Fishy...", "comment_date": "2020-02-20T00:43:34Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Michael Gibb", "comment_text": "We all know there&#39;s no such thing as a fish. \ud83d\ude09", "comment_date": "2020-02-20T00:43:18Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Frank Valdi", "comment_text": "That is what happens you think your smart and try  to cram  false information into a theory.

Main purpose of systematics is to made work with biodiversity more sufficient. Molecular methods great to find polyphyly or some hidden close relations, but if to made a system only by genetic differences ignoring morphology (like 95% differences, 90% differences, etc) - it will be unusable for practical purposes.
