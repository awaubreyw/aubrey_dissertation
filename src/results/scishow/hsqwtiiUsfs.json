Areas that fossilize well are awfully rare, albeit some areas do really well in making man into fossil, like the famed Olduvai Gorge. <br><br>Now for a long time, scientist have thought that because of lack of fossils, mankind was more or less restricted to those areas were fossils were found, evolving right there and only there, so we&#39;ve been thinking East Africa was man&#39;s cradle.\u00a0<br><br>That may have been the case, but... It might as well be that Humans have made enormous evolutionary steps in areas like forests or swamp uplands (the slightly higher hills in and around river floodplains which still are popular today as dwelling areas for ppl to survive in the wild)\u00a0<br>These are areas where fossilizing is notoriously rare and difficult - but at same time these niches put vastly different ecological stresses on evolving species than the drier highlands in East Africa. It might even be, several species of early humans have evolved in non-fossilizing areas, gone their ways when circumstances changed, evolved further, and the old humanoid that didn&#39;t fossilize, has never been seen again, except for sudden changes in later human fossils.<br><br>So, most of us still think we came out of East Africa - but fossils from other areas are erased, so what do we really know ? \u00a0<br>As far I&#39;m aware, it still unknown how and where Neanderthals evolved to the study Home Sapiens N. we know (Yup Neanders are Homo S, but one sapiens short from us, Homo double sapiens).\u00a0<br>It&#39;s like a burned down library of which only the doused books remain, and todays historians arent yet aware that that judge history by the books that survived, not aware that there have other books<br>There might innumerous chapters missing from human history, kinda like over 95%  of the library.
