There is no definitive proof of it being any particular mineral (they may even have used more than one), but two things are known. The first is that CALCITE (transparent, crystalline calcite known as iceland spar) works as a way to determine direction on a cloudy or foggy day when the sun&#39;s position in the sky is impossible to determine by just, y&#39;know, looking at it. And there has been a large crystal of calcite found in a Norse shipwreck off the English coast.<br><br>Tanzanite is my favorite of the pleochroic minerals. When I was in Tanzania, I visited TanzaniteONE, a major mining effort there that produces a LOT (possibly the majority) of the world&#39;s tanzanite...and I managed to procure a small crystal of UNCUT Tanzanite from a vendor in Zanzibar (those in the know are aware that uncut tanzanite is illegal to take out of Tanzania, however, my crystal was hastily incorporated into a necklace pendant, and as part of jewellery, the export of tanzanite is allowed). It is delightful, one of my personal favorite mineral specimens I own (and I own hundreds of pounds of rocks and minerals from all over the place, mostly collected by me). Tourmaline might be my all-time favorite mineral group though, because of its &quot;garbage-can&quot; status (i.e. you can chuck so many different elements into it, it accepts so many). I have some elbaite and schorl samples (I actually collected a pretty nice schorl myself in Bancroft, Ontario), and am always poking around looking for nice watermelon specimens at reasonable prices (haven&#39;t found a great one yet).", "comment_date": "2019-08-18T22:25:38Z", "likes_count": 4}, {"comment_by": "CSCJB", "comment_text": "why not change the title of the video to 5 Pleochroic minerals.
