I hope the topic was not suggested by the koslicki-lab and produced as an advertisment for their research. The papers that SciShow showed do not seem to contain randomized controlled trials and but only observational studies, some with very limited sample sizes. If there is clinically relevant measurable benefit from meta-genomics interventions in healthcare, hopefully the research will show. I may be wrong but this video somehow gives me the feeling, this was not an objective view of the research. As a physician, I am excited about the possibilities that might come from metagenomics, especially having worked in pediatric infectiology for a very short time. However, there is always lots of money to be made for companies who offer these kind of services and, thus, conflicts of interest might arise. I hope this channel maintains editorial independence, keeps it&#39;s credibility and does not become something like Veritatium has become with its sponsored videos.", "comment_date": "2022-02-21T18:55:07Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "LittleLady", "comment_text": "Scary stuff", "comment_date": "2022-02-21T16:39:01Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "annatanneberger1", "comment_text": "Antibiotic-resistant germs is not a new discovery.

The idea that certain microbes had evolved to resist multiple drugs was terrifying.  Now we know that many of the most common diseases have acquired this ability.  Not only that, but they continue to evolve to maintain this status.  In hospitals there are warning signs on doors to rooms where MSRA patients are to be sure that caregivers wear protective clothing to avoid spreading those particular microbes though the general patient population.  Still, not all patients are screened for this; only when they are not responding to traditional treatment and not getting better (or getting worse) that this testing takes place.  MSRA kills more people every year, (over 100,000 in 2019 alone), and we are not producing new drugs to combat it since pharmaceutical companies don&#39;t want to spend the money and time for a drug that may already be obsolete by the time it is manufactured (usually 3-6 years) since the microbes will already have evolved past it.  However, many diseases are acquiring this ability through the over-use of common antibiotics.  This is particularly acute for diseases like tuberculosis, which is basically untreatable with current medicines in about 70% of patients now, and there are many others on that road as well.  Containing the spread of these medicine-resistant diseases is really mankind&#39;s only hope of escaping disaster as we regress to a time when there were no antibiotics and sickness spread and usually killed huge numbers of people.", "comment_date": "2022-02-20T21:38:09Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Law 86", "comment_text": "<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDkKCw3xeYo&amp;t=3m51s\">3:51</a> Classic metaphor.", "comment_date": "2022-02-20T18:03:36Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "T1Oracle", "comment_text": "Instead of antibiotics, we need to focus on probiotics more.", "comment_date": "2022-02-20T16:15:01Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "E Zach Lee Wright", "comment_text": "How far along are we in regards to using phage therapy to kick superbug ass?", "comment_date": "2022-02-20T15:01:54Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "dillonvillon", "comment_text": "Hospitals are nasty and you shouldn&#39;t go unless you think you might die.", "comment_date": "2022-02-20T14:00:59Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Wesley Williams", "comment_text": "The name has meta in it so I\u2019m not trusting it lol", "comment_date": "2022-02-20T13:48:26Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Tarin", "comment_text": "The stool background when talking about stools was really funny", "comment_date": "2022-02-20T13:44:03Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "djgruby", "comment_text": "Factory farming in animal agriculture has incomparably larger impact on a widespread antibiotic resistance than hospitals.

My family works in the industry, and they tell me about how so many of their coworkers are deeply unhealthy, smokers are common, even in respiratory specialists, and obesity is also very common. I think it shows a fundamental misstep in the way we approach health. We fight disease a lot more than we seek health. We like simple equations of health, see problem, destroy\\fix problem.
