The vents of Kawah Ijen are spewing out volcanic gases, including elemental sulfur in vapour form. It&#39;s cooling and condensing ( helped along by humans who have hammered pipes into the vents to speed up the cooling and solidifying of the sulfur), so you literally get flows of molten sulfur running down the crater walls. The flows still produce some vapour and it&#39;s this reacting with oxygen to create the blue flames.

Speaking from an evolutionary standpoint, intelligence just isn&#39;t an efficient adaptation.  Look at literally every other species on earth, as many have thrived much better then us without it.  My theory on why this occurs is based off of how the first warm-blooded animals evolved. It was an adaptation in which ultimately granted their survival through the pending apocalypse(the great extinction). Perhaps evolution posses some form of intuition somehow, and a doom will eventually impede the world once again, however no other adaptation could possibly save life.

It is only releasing gases, some of which, like the video said, are sulfur compounds. Entrepreneurial daredevils living nearby saw that the sulfur gases reacted together to form elemental sulfur (a useful element in the production of sugar, of all things), and so they installed metal condensing pipes into the volcano&#39;s fumaroles (gas vents) to cool the gases before they are released to the atmosphere, resulting in more yellow stuff to mine, and more money in their pockets (though it&#39;s a very dangerous job and certainly shortens life spans to under 40 years for people who do it long enough - these gases are quite toxic). When the sulfur burns, it glows blue. But it is decidedly not lava, there is no glowing, Hawaiian-style molten rock coming out of that volcano. In fact, the volcano hasn&#39;t actually erupted AT ALL for about 15 years. Please get your facts straight SciShow.<br><br>On another note, Ol Doinyo Lengai volcano in Tanzania could have easily made the list as a volcano that looks really weird, and does really weird things (lava flowing nearly as fast as water, for one, plus it makes some very bizarre-looking landforms).
