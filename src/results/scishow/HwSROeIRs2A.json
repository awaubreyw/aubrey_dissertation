Don&#39;t tell us that he only made $1,080 a year in 1908. Almost no one has any idea what that means because of the effect of inflation. For example, if you had said $3000 a year, we would think that that was also a pathetic and unfairly small salary. However, $3000 would have actually been a really good salary, equivalent to around $100,000 today adjusted for inflation. When you do things like this, you make educated people feel like you&#39;re biased and (in this case) it gives them a legitimate reason to discount what you&#39;re saying. <br>Instead of saying &quot;In 1908, he accepted a teaching position at Sumner High School with a starting salary of $1080 a year.&quot; you should say &quot;He became a high school teacher making the equivalent of $28,000 a year in today&#39;s money.&quot; or...&quot;making half of what he would as a professor&quot;. The actual number and location are both less important than the fact that he was making less than he should have given his merits. If on the other hand he was making the same amount as a professor, or that was  a good salary for the time, then the whole point actually was to mislead.
