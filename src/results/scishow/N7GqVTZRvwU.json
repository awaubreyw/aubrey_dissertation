While earthworms are interesting in their own right with colorful and/or large variants (for colors my favorite is the fried egg worm and for size the longest earthworm measured was 21 feet long), the most interesting annelids are the ones that barely ever get discussed. <br><br>While still well known, leeches are more interesting than you&#39;d think. Some are colorful, they can have anywhere between 2 and 10 eyespots, there are terrestrial variants that move by grabbing the surface with their mouth and anus, and some aren&#39;t parasitic and instead swallow other worms whole.<br><br>Some worms are filter feeders like the Tube Worms mentioned in the video. Most of them feed with feather-like appendages which in some species have eyespots, they are aptly named Feather Worms. Another example are the Christmas Tree Worms that have two filter feeding appendages that resemble christmas trees and have eyes in their gills.<br><br>Some of these worms even superficially resemble arthropods (spiders, crabs, bugs, etc), having mandibles, antenna, eyes and/or rudimentary &quot;legs&quot;. Some of my favorite examples are the Bobbit Worms which snatch fish and pull them underground, Sea Mice, Ragworms, Bearded Fireworms among many, many others.<br><br>I didn&#39;t even touch on some of the other interesting groups of this phylum (bristleworms, spoon worms, peanut worms, etc), let alone the other really interesting worms out there like velvet worms, arrow worms, ribbon worms, penis worms, lancelets (close relatives to vertebrates) and so on.", "comment_date": "2022-05-11T14:37:34Z", "likes_count": 2}, {"comment_by": "icedragonair", "comment_text": "I love planarians.
