I have not put any energy in to this system yet the superfluid is going up and dropping over the side running the water wheel giving me free energy. I think insted if you perfectly drop water on flat glass it would spill out in all directions perfectly in a circle. with watter it&#39;s a small circle but what if it were to spread out to be only one atom thick, and what if <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Van_der_Waals_force\">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Van_der_Waals_force</a> made it stick and coat anything regardless of shape. I think if you had a big enough container, it would stop crawling up the walls. because it would run out of liquid to coat. the only reason it is being pushed up the sides of the container is because it is more then one atom thick and the gravity pulling it down creates pressure in all directions. just a guess, but the perpetual motion is a problem.", "comment_date": "2019-04-24T21:27:21Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "iDomain", "comment_text": "so every human reseach started because some prehistorical human say: &quot;why?&quot;", "comment_date": "2019-04-24T20:05:06Z", "likes_count": 3}, {"comment_by": "Angelo Alexander", "comment_text": "&quot;I never freeze&quot; - t&#39;challa aka &quot;Helium&quot;", "comment_date": "2019-04-24T20:03:56Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Humble Servant", "comment_text": "So boring....", "comment_date": "2019-04-24T19:42:43Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Jane Joestar", "comment_text": "Immagine a piece of tech that can change the state of energy states in matter, frictionless surfaces would be crazy", "comment_date": "2019-04-24T19:22:14Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "chris roberts", "comment_text": "Please upload a video of these helium reactions!", "comment_date": "2019-04-24T18:05:57Z", "likes_count": 3}, {"comment_by": "JoseKnight 1", "comment_text": "Great vid, but don&#39;t make a video of an amazing phenomenon that we can see without showing it.", "comment_date": "2019-04-24T17:45:06Z", "likes_count": 2}, {"comment_by": "Samuel Tibbitts", "comment_text": "<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zJblFBwqjPo&amp;t=4m47s\">4:47</a> are those the stats for Helium-3 or Helium-4?
