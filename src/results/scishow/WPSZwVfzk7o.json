Anyways, my diet could help, but I like to eat the foods I was raised to eat and can afford, but aren&#39;t the best for my condition ...rice and beans. Doctor referred me to a nutritionist who stated I had insulin resistance. I agreed to try the drug Ozempic and at first I had a day or two of light-headedness and nausea. After week 2 I noticed I was doing more and had less pain and on top of that was losing weight. I was on it for a total of 3 months and was ready for a refill. Unfortunately, the $895 cost for 30 day supply, which is a discount, is something I am not willing to pay even if I feel fantastic. I am considering traveling abroad to purchase a 3 month supply, but I wish this was not the case....and after 2 months the pain and stiffness  and weight are back.
