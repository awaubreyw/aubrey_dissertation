Real adaptations to changes in environment, diet, or threats comes from a function of the biological system that gene expression comes from, called the epigenome.  Adaptations come from all life&#39;s epigenomes by turning genes up and down or up and down to modify itself to new adaptations and body structures WITHOUT ANY DNA MUTATION INVOLVEMENT. This passes adaptations for at least HUNDREDS of generations, perhaps thousands. In 2014, these new facts was elucidated for the first time in peer review by Dr. Skinner and others in their research. This kind of adaptation by the same pre-built biological system of the epigenome would be of an intelligent design signature. Makes perfect sense since biological structures-by-chance-self-assembly are mathematical impossibilities of up to 10^600 for DNA sequences while the impossibility standard by many mathematicians starts at 10^50. Total atomic particles in the universe is 10^80. <br><br>So...what was called &#39;evidence&#39; for evolution by natural selection of DNA mutations turned out to be an already-there epigenomes. This includes many looked-at organisms such as the Darwin Finch and some of the examples of antibiotic resistance in bacteria and viruses. It&#39;s called EPIGENETICS in the study of its actions. Adaptations without DNA mutations as the theory of evolution claimed for all these decades is a logistics-killer. It leaves the only one alternative of life being a creation. The Creator&#39;s name is Jesus Christ. The theory of evolution has been scientifically explained why it is not happening. <br><br>So...what does DNA mutations actually do and why were they used as &#39;evidence&#39; for evolution? They will cause different traits and appearances in animals that are short of life-ending genetic diseases. Evolutionists used this ambiguity purposely or by ignorance. They used the action of the epigenetic adaptations as a smoke screen in their claims of genome degeneration causing evolutionary generation. Evolution has been a big juggling act. Since real adaptations by epigenetics without evolving DNA mutations makes ALL macroevolution schemes impossible...such as men evolving from the past from apes or in the future into flesh-eating monsters.<br><br>Need proof of epigenetics being able to cause new structures without evolution&#39;s-needed DNA mutations? Just look at all of the caterpillars and their resulting butterflies and moths after metamorphosis. It is epigenetic modifications, gene expression same-action that does it. The DNA of a caterpillar is exactly the same as its later-on butterfly. New structures such as new wings come about by pre-enabled-to-do epigenetics. This is the same process that Darwin Finches get new beaks, bacteria get new antibiotic resistance, cavefish lost their eyesight...or their offspring get it back after some generations later when taken out of the caves by evolution-replacing epigenetics. There you go. You are welcome. It&#39;s so much better to know the truth than believe lies in just one life we live. It&#39;s fun, isn&#39;t it?

It is also incorrect to claim or assume that based on random changes we expect half the differences to have arisen in chimps and half in humans, because chimps evolve much more rapidly than humans. Chimps&#39; differences from our last common ancestor are substantially greater than humans&#39; differences. This is because evolution happens when mutations occur in the germ line, each time that an egg is fertilized by a sperm and an offspring is produced --- some estimates reckon that about 600 new mutations occur in each new human conceptus. Since the chimp generation time is much shorter than the human generation time, that is chimps reach sexual maturity much faster than humans, they have gone through many more generations since our last common ancestor, hence chimps are much more highly evolved than humans. Note that high evolution rate has nothing to do with being more advanced or superior in any way, since mutation and evolution is a random walk in no particular direction. If a new mutation is advantageous it may nevertheless be lost by chance, and even if is inherited by descendants it takes many generations to spread to a substantial proportion of the species. Even a new mutation that is present in thousands of individuals can be lost by chance (genetic drift).", "comment_date": "2021-07-12T14:57:42Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "sombodysdad", "comment_text": "DNA does not determine biological form.

I have researched in secular peer-review pro-evolution papers or sanctioned secular science magazines. I can listen to two pro-evolution scientists talk and find non-friendly facts against evolution. This is called hostile witness evidence and follows the principles of &#39;police science&#39; in investigations. Investigators, in this science, will gather evidence for and against each position and make a court presentation of evidence that prosecutors or the defense can use to win or lose the case. Also, the biological &#39;science&#39; of evolution disrupts other sciences such as political science, social science, economic science, and science in psychology. It&#39;s not harmonious. Why? The evolutionary theory is junk. It&#39;s framed evidence with misrepresentations and spin. Evidence for intelligent design? It would be dozens of measurements and constants in chemistry and physics to a precision of mathematical impossibilities-by-chance of 10^40 to 10^120 each. Then there are millions, billions, and trillions in biological structures that are mathematical impossibilities-by-chance of 10^450 to 10^600 each in biological-structure arrangements in life-giving DNA and protein sequences that without the catch-22&#39;s needed to make them live on. Those catch-22&#39;s would be mathematical impossibilities-by-chance too. What is a mathematical impossibility? Many PhD mathematicians consider it to be 10^50. Why? There are only 10^80 atomic particles in the universe. If your possibility comes within 60% and even exceed it of the 10^80 particles then truly you have mathematical impossibilities. A real strong intelligent design signature. <br><br>How is the chance of a biological structures by-chance of 10^450 to 10^600 determined? Answer this question. Questions answer questions very nicely. You have a one in six chance of rolling a six with a dice. How is it determined to be so? It&#39;s because it has six sides. Conversely, a life giving protein or DNA sequence-by-chance is done in the same manner to arrive at the values. Simple.  <br><br>What does the evolutionary theory have? It has framed evidence to a desired wanted belief for many ulterior motives that humans are capable of having. How about the &#39;evidence&#39; for evolution such as the appendix, whales hips, and the recurrent laryngeal nerve? They have intelligent design found purposes. The appendix re-supplies good bacteria to the gut after an illness, the whale hips supports the uterus, the fetus, and the male organs for sex. The hips also cups the immense weight of internal intestinal and digestive organs as it dives and ascends. The recurrent laryngeal nerve goes has branches for different purposes and gives you the &#39;gut feeling&#39; and emotions in your heart. This nerve has been cut or damaged in accidents...so it DOES have a ID signature found out by its absence of function. The blood vessels in front of the human retina serves as a UV light filter for protection. The octopus has it behind because the ocean water filters the sun&#39;s UV rays. Yes, we are a creation.

Other species in the plant, insect, and animal kingdoms that are &#39;evolutionary cousins&#39; have a 20% to 40% in these unique genes. Evolution&#39;s &#39;gradualist&#39; theorized steps should make ALL genes to have similarities...in theory. Not 20% to 40% TOTAL DIFFERENCE.

The chimps are missing 33% of the genes that the human&#39;s have. What is the Y chromosome? It gives male offspring to the both of us. If chimps are missing 33% of the genes then how can it make a 96% identical male offspring? The secular scientist who took part in this shock finding said the difference was HORRENDOUS.
