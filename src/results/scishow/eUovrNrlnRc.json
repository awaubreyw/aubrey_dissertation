(&quot;Directly above&quot; refers to the fly&#39;s points of reference, <i>NOT</i> TO YOURS!)  That distance is dependent on the ambient temperature (I&#39;ll explain that in a moment, honestly!\u2606)  Also, analyze the angle of the fly&#39;s stance in relation to the surface upon which it is standing, as you want the fly&#39;s initial spring to take it DIRECTLY BETWEEN your palms.  <br>          When perfectly positioned, DON&#39;T EVEN THINK ABOUT THE FLY, JUST ABRUPTLY <b>SLAP</b> YOUR HANDS TOGETHER!  <b>THE FLY WILL, VERY OBLIGINGLY, LEAP DIRECTLY BETWEEN YOUR QUICKLY CLOSING HANDS - AND BE CRUSHED!</b><br>          \u2606The warmer the air, the <b>more lively a fly will be,</b> and his initial &quot;spring!&quot; will be significantly higher in warmer air.  Also, if the fly is standing on a sloping surface, his initial spring WON&#39;T be taken in a &quot;right-angle to gravity&quot; direction, as one might suppose, but rather he will spring almost <i>DIRECTLY</i> in a 90\u00b0 angle to the surface he&#39;s standing on, instead.  (Watch a couple of &quot;startled&quot; flies take off, if you need verification of this; it might surprise you!)<br>          This method can have a <i>VERY</i> <b>HIGH success rate,</b> and individual success <b>WILL IMPROVE</b> with practice &amp; experience!  Nowadays, my DH &quot;gets his beast&quot; about 90-95% of first tries these days, but then, at the age of 78 he <i>HAS</i> slowed down a bit since his younger years (who hasn&#39;t?)

They can evade you 2, 3, 4, 5 times, but... they get tired if you are constant. So, after about 20 seconds they are very tired, and after 40 seconds they often land and don&#39;t move anymore. This is the same technique the native African hunters of old do with four legged creatures that can out run humans.

First of all the fly has to land and stay sitting some place where you can do this, ideally a countertop or other flat surface with enough room on either side of the fly. Position both hands on either side of the fly about 6 in away, most of the time the fly will fly away at this point providing it doesn&#39;t, bring both hands together rapidly as though you were going to clap. Right before reaching the fly lift your hands up about 1 or 2 in then smack them together. Ideally the fly should be right between your hands and will get smacked. This is because the fly having to try to dodge two obstacles won&#39;t be able to get away. The reason  you lift your hands at the last second is because the fly jumps straight up and you want to catch him smack in the middle of your palm.<br>The reason this works is because if you approach a fly from one direction it will fly in the other automatically without thinking about it. By presenting the fly with two obstacles coming at it at the same time the fly has to think for a brief instant and it usually flies straight up. This positions it directly between your two incoming hands hence lifting at the last second your hands up an inch or so", "comment_date": "2021-12-28T05:31:10Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "kawmaster!", "comment_text": "It isn&#39;t.
