There are so many insanely interesting shark species out there. Even some of the \u201cHollywood classics\u201d are a lot cooler than people give them credit for (thanks, film industry). The bull shark can regulate its own salinity, which allows it to move back and forth between salt and fresh water. The tiger shark is just known for eating whatever the hell it wants (there\u2019s a story out there of scientists cutting open a tiger shark to find a live Inuit fisherman inside). The mako shark is incredibly fast. The cookie cutter shark bites circular holes in its very large prey (dolphins, whales, etc.) instead of eating it entirely (hence the name), and has been known to go after submarines. The basking shark is a huge filter-feeding species that has an absolutely gigantic mouth. It literally just basks in the open water as tiny organisms swim into its huge, gaping maw. Hammerheads have, as the name suggests, hammer-shaped heads that are used to dig up prey from in the sand. They have an eye on either side of the \u201chammer\u201d, and so have to turn their heads back and forth as they swim in order to see in front of them. The whale shark is a massive shark (up to 50 feet long) that\u2019s entirely peaceful. It\u2019s another filter feeder. There are sharks out there that are livebearers, which is super cool. There\u2019s also just a crazy amount of diversity among egg shapes and sizes.<br><br>And this is all to do with sharks that still exist. You\u2019ve also got prehistoric oddities like the guy with the weird wheel jaw, or the one with bristles on its head.<br><br>In summary, sharks are incredibly fascinating creatures, and you should totally learn more about them.", "comment_date": "2019-02-11T14:46:47Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Koaw Nature", "comment_text": "Great analysis of unusual shark adaptations!
