Actually, we can. Stradivarius are no better than the best hand-crafted violins made today. Strads are definitely better than machine-made violins and custom violins, but they are not better than hand-crafted violins from the best lutiers today. The reason why the sound of a Strad sounds so much more polished and richer than that of even the best hand-made violins today is mostly due totwo things:\r<br>1. The polish - We don&#39;t know exactly what varnish Stradivarius used, but the varnish that he used was specific to Cremona at the time, and had a mix of minerals and oils that gave the wood great density and ressonance ability but without creating echo. While it is impossible to replicate the exact varnishes that Stradivarius used, we can replicate varnishes that give the wood a density and ressonance ability similar to a Strad byu analysing the density and sound vibrancy of the wood.<br>2. Time - Like wine, violins get better with time as the wood becomes less and less echoey which allows it to vibrate sounds more clearly. <br>If you were to get the absolute top-of-the-line hand-crafted violins from some of the best lutiers from France and Italy today, and give it a varnish similar to the ones used in Cremona at the time, you would basically have a brand-new Stradivarius. The problem is, you would still need to wait 200 years for it tio truly sound like a Strad. Even 100 years is too short a time for that. We can replicate perfectly the artisinal craftsmanship of a Stradivarius, and we can replicate well although nor perfectly the varnishing. What we cannot replicate, though, is the effect of the passage of time. So yes, we cannot have new Strads <b>now</b> .", "comment_date": "2022-08-18T05:24:54Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "C L", "comment_text": "Look for the video Ray Chen comparing a Strat to a $69 violin, I could tell the difference even in my crappy phone speaker.

The value of these pieces is going to be subjective but the age, history and quality of the sound is a testament to them being works of art, just like many paintings or sculptures. It may be arguable the value of these kinds of things but they hold an elusive quality of being nearly unreplicatable, just like famous works of art, and I think the stories act as inspiration and romanticize the process of developing and crafting an instrument.

I know someone with extremely acute color sensitivity. This person can (for example) not only match fabrics dyed from the same dye vs other dye lots, they can match fabrics within a specific dye lot. I&#39;ve tested this individual&#39;s color matching ability using the finest distinctions possible with 24-bit color, at it is indeed pretty exceptional. In tests, no one else I&#39;ve found (including professional artists), can match it. <br><br>The same goes for taste, hearing, and touch. So unless an extremely high standard set and bench-marked, these blind test are meaningless. If perhaps only one person in 1,000 can reliably tell a Strad from another violin, or 1 in 10,000, or 1 in 10 million, it doesn&#39;t mean the difference is not there. It simply means that only that person can discern it. <br><br>As for the psychological effect, this is also can also be misunderstood. Our brains can be trained to recognize fine distinctions, but they don&#39;t always. It takes effort and motivation -- the brain needs to be &quot;primed&quot; to do the work, to focus and concentrate, to detect these fine distinctions. Otherwise, they&#39;ll be missed. Telling a person &quot;you&#39;re playing/listening to&quot; a Strad could be just such a clue. <br><br>Finally, the whole &quot;these 2 things are exactly the same&quot; -- no. No 2 things are exactly the same. There are always differences. They exist at gradations varying from course, to extremely fine, down to the molecular and to atomic level. What is the limit of discernment? Under the proper conditions, the naked human eye (some exceptional human eyes, that is) can detect as few as 2 photons -- possibly even one. It&#39;s quite remarkable -- and not easy to achieve. So whether it&#39;s violins or cigarettes, the powers of human perception often exceed the ability of people setting up tests to determine the degree of similarity between the things being tested, and the testing method can be based on unfounded assumptions. All of this must be considered before concluding two things are &quot;the same&quot; or not. <br><br>For the record, I have a tin ear. I couldn&#39;t tell a Strad from a bust chainsaw.

Kids, right?  <br>Stradivari Violins are not the BEST sounding violins.  They just have a sound.  That sound is bright, with highs for cutting in a large hall.  Stradivari and Guarnei both learned from another violin maker called Amati.  Amati&#39;s violins sounded great, but were not very loud.  I mean, not very loud at all, as in you could maybe hear it well in a reflective bathroom.  So, this is where Stradivari and Guarnei learned their crafts. <br><br>Stradivari Violins were made for playing large halls AND having the people in the far seats be able to hear them.  Stradivari Violins don&#39;t actually sound as good a del Gesu/Guarneri violin which is best in chamber music.... in smaller rooms. They have better low tones than a Strad.  A Stradivari in a small live chamber can make your ears and eyes bleed. The del Gesu in the same chamber (20&#39; x 20&#39; x 20&#39;) will warm your heart.   The del Gesu violins have a dark (deep warm) sound.  These rooms or halls are part of the instrument, actually.  The instruments are DRIVERS for the hall or chamber.  An old friend of mine, now dead, turned sheet music for Heifetz when he came through town in the Midwest.  He said Heifetz sounded like ripping and not good up where he was.  However, Heifetz&#39;s playing that night as it went into the hall sounded great.  You see, the violin is part of the room at that point.  <br><br>The prices of these either of these violins is based on their collectors value, not the sound.  They are investments, like paintings or stocks.  Heifetz had one of each in the 1940s.  You can see them on films that were made of him back stage from then.  The face of must violins are made of spruce.  There is a stage where the face is tuned.  That means that wood is removed (bottom or top, but mostly bottom) to reach a pitch when tapped on.  You know, tap tap tap.  This will cause the face, all by itself with out being attached to the rest of the violin, to resonate at a pitch.  As in F5 mandolins this pitch is important to the tone.  They don&#39;t use sandpaper or CNC machines to do this.   Just to confuse the readers, the bow makes more difference in the sound that the violin.  Things like the weight, the action, etc... all make a big difference.  However, if you have the right bow, with the right hair, and the right strings, with the right rosin, and then a player like Heifetz, then violin can be the important part of the combo.  The violinist&#39;s technique makes all the difference here.   You can see where violin makers were trying to address specific performance conditions back then.  <br><br>It is amazing how many instrument makers have no clue as to what the performer looks for, acoustically, in an instrument.

At first at least, he most often used wood from the ocean. He would search for sunken ships and broken boat oars, because the wood was very good and free. Later in life as he and his sons became more prosperous their primary wood of choice was Norway Spruce, for the front and back. Maple on the side. Ebony or rosewood on the neck. 3.

Modern guitars often have this incredible wood with 64 rings and inch, and expertly sawn.  Some of the old 19th century guitars use stuff you could have got in a 1970s 2x4.  The better wood is tighter, stiffer, definetly what you want in an airplane wing, but not necessarily is a vibratory surface,<br><br>2) Modern makers often finish everything as though it was a piece of furniture for the finest salon.  This can include very finely finished inner surfaces where the air volume is (not coated, just super smoothed).  It has been suggested that this pumps air less efficiently.  Seems unlikely, but it is at least a thing.<br><br>3) There is some evidence that playing instruments makes them more responsive, so centuries of playing by great violinists might loosen the violin up.  I had a guitar that when played fingerstyle, sounded a lot better when you strummed it violently for a while, first.  It was really noticeable.  It was a peculiar guitar, with only two braces and a stiffer top.  There are, or were devices that vibrate instruments on purpose like this.  With my guitar, you had to loosen it every time.

His earliest ones very much followed the Amati pattern, as it was Andreas Amati who invented the instrument and to whom Stradivari was an apprentice. His mid-period instruments had some what larger bodies while his late period instruments were back to a smaller size again but with not such a deep curve on the plates. Thus said, all the known violins do seem to have a &#39;house sound&#39; which is different from either the Guaneri or Amati (Nicolo) violins which were also made in Cremona at around the same time period and from very similar timber. Having heard all three in a demonstration there is quite a difference. The sound of the Amati can be described as &#39;deeper&#39;, &#39;richer&#39; and &#39;darker&#39; than the others. Guaneri are known for being &#39;powerful&#39; and &#39;penetrating&#39;, some players select them for this feature. Stradivari are often considered to have the best balance, with words like &#39;silken&#39;, &#39;silvery&#39;, &#39;crystal clear&#39; and &#39;expressive&#39; being used to describe their sound. Just as any good modern luthier can engineer a guitar to produce a sound of a particular character, so it seems that the violin makers in Cremona could do the same with their violins. One can imagine that &#39;back in the day&#39; a violin player might have selected which maker to purchase his instrument from based upon how he wanted it to play and sound. The Carpathian Spruce and European Sycamore (not Maple, but a related species) with which those violin makers started would have been selected from the same supply.", "comment_date": "2021-12-17T02:24:34Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "PJ Ostrowski", "comment_text": "I have conducted research on the violin and modern violin makers.

People were more in awe of his violin than there were of him. At this reception, there were many of the accompanying symphony&#39;s musicians with their violins. Kreisler, frustrated, asked to play a sampling of the musicians violins; they all sounded like his Stradivari.  Simply it was Kreisler&#39;s unique tone and phrasing that made each instrument  Kreisler&#39;s. Hmmm, sounds like a Strad.

The luthier I know thinks that he treated his wood with very harsh acidic chemicals in a copper tub as to prevent any bugs from eating away the wood in his instruments. The acid opened up pours in the wood allowing it to have a \u201csofter, silvery sound\u201d but have a more flat shape than the violins before him. Flat shapes generally have less softness but more volume. His had the flatness for volume but the porous wood to have the softer tone, being exactly what every violinist wants. No sacrifice for volume of tone, but both. You can vary the shape of the violin to adjust how soft the tone is and how loud it is. But, with wood like that, especially the more dense wood from post ice age, no matter the shape, the violin will sound better than another violin of the same volume or tone. Because it will be louder than a violin with a similar tone, and sound better than a violin with a similar volume.<br><br>His microscope analysis of a Stradivari showed the wood was more porous than other violins of similar age as well.<br><br>But him being a secretive luthier himself, he never published the information he found, as he is now trying to make his own technique to replicate it.

It was 2AM and he NEVER acted like that. He was an Army Ranger, in for holiday leave as well, and so I invited him in. I knew something was wrong. He carried a familiar, ratty looking guitar case and laid it on the kitchen table. Without a word he opened it and I knew what I would see, but my heart sank when the damage was visible.<br>    It was a guitar his father had made in &#39;Nam, the old man&#39;s second tour. He&#39;d improvised his own jigs, bartered wherever he could for materials, and glue, and slowly fashioned probably the lightest guitar I&#39;d ever held in my hands, before or since. Apparently, on his trip home, the airport staff had dropped the case, and the impact had sprung about a third of the seam between the top and side around from next to the pick-guard around past the tail-piece.<br><br>    The old man had died while my friend was on his first tour of duty, and this was especially hard for him to deal with... I was the only person he knew who remotely resembled a lutier... SO I nodded and offered a brave smile... and still without a syllable, he retreated to the door and out. He was never one to let anyone see him cry.<br><br>    It took a week, but very VERY carefully I steamed and prayed, inching my way around to fully expose the joint and extract the neck of the thing. I took off the tail-piece and simply enough, sacrificed the strings. They weren&#39;t important. They get used up, and for about 5 bucks, I could easily replace them. Every creek or murmur of the wood and my nerves were rattled, I&#39;d cringe or wince so hard I could practically taste my own testicles! BUT finally, the top rose away and I was able to gaze at a delicacy of carving and shaping I could scarcely fathom... Next I examined every inch. There were a few stressed cracks, but some super-glue or urethane was dabbled into them deeply with X-Acto&#39;s and a biological probe, I&#39;d found in a microscope kit years before... AND careful weighing down or clamping kept the thing from curling out of place while the glue finished curing... I scraped and scraped and then snapped off the end of a square file to scrub through grooves to get rid of the old glue, and finally cleaned it all before adding fresh, modern adhesive and then pressing the guitar carefully back together... I went ahead and rode down to a store in town for a new set of strings... and a set of AA batteries for my old digital tuner... A new piece of leather was needed for the neck, firming the fitting properly before I could remove the last of old wires and immediately replace them with fresh... AND it was nicely tuned when Nate came around to check up on my progress...<br><br>   AND his joy at seeing his Daddy&#39;s old guitar not only back in one piece but to pick it up and play it again... THAT was a moment I will never forget. Not only had I been truly privileged with the trust of a beloved instrument, the last piece of his father&#39;s heart, soul, and memory embodied in something hand made by the old man, but I&#39;d accomplished what I was trusted to do. Two boys had left their home town for different ends of the world, during our own war-time services... We&#39;d become men and done a LOT of growing up for that.<br><br>     ...BUT for that beloved guitar, hand crafted in a hell-hole like Vietnam by the grizzled hands of a Marine who&#39;d be hated when he returned... We were boys again... if for a short time. We could sing and dance as if we were rock-stars, and the old man was right there in our hearts and memories... dancing and laughing with us...<br><br>     It was GLORIOUS. It was the single MOST BEAUTIFUL sounding instrument I&#39;d ever heard in my life... and will likely remain so. ;o)", "comment_date": "2021-11-20T00:56:54Z", "likes_count": 262}, {"comment_by": "Stuffed Something", "comment_text": "So, the pairing of the harmonics with the acoustics of the room weren&#39;t brought into question in much depth, I feel like that&#39;s definitely gotta play a part.", "comment_date": "2021-11-19T23:11:12Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Zach", "comment_text": "Why does everyone believe Strad was the best?

However when the price range starts to go up whether from name brand value or the quality of the luthier or the materials used to manufacture the violin, a violin&#39;s sound starts to feel more whole and tends to have alot more depth and resonance compared to factory made violins. Its important to note though that price is never a 100 percent correct indication of quality and when buying a violin you should go for the best sound in your price range.

What these tests can tell us is, after pass a certain point for the majority of people the small incremental of quality doesn\u2019t matter. However if you have someone that plays a Strad almost on a daily basis I.e Ray Chen (or in the case of wine, you have Masters of Wine and Master Sommeliers doing the wine tastings) the likelihood of these research being inconclusive is highly unlikely. In the case of wine things are even more complex because some wines are expensive due to supply and demand. On average, if you use the most expensive methods of making wines and you are able to make a good quality wine at a reasonable volume (the annual volume of lafite) you are looking at approx $80 a bottle to cover your costs and make some profit. So from a quality standpoint, a medium size no name winery could theoretically produce a bottle of wine that rivals a lafite but is significantly cheaper. This makes the whole concept of having someone blind test to guess price based on quality to be more flawed, since you can\u2019t taste spike in price caused by demand. The same could be said for Strads in the sense that modern violin is cheaper and people can\u2019t tell the difference between it and the Strad doesn\u2019t devalue the Strad, it just means there are more supply of the modern violin than the Strad and in fact it shows the Strad is amazing to sound on par if not better than modern violins with ancient violin making methods.", "comment_date": "2021-10-28T22:30:48Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Maverick", "comment_text": "Me: we can&#39;t make what?

People swear up and down that Stradivarius violin is the most beautiful sounding violin of all time, simply because it&#39;s a Stradivarius violin, and the violins stature, and provenance, leads to people thinking it sounds better than others, when it just sounds like a premium violin. Not that they don&#39;t sound better than a $50 violin, because they do. They were built by an 18th century master craftsman, over the course of a 20 hours. Rather than modern $50 violins, which are commonly built by a a 22 year old factory worker, over the course of 20 minutes. However, there are violins on the market today, in the 2k, to $10,000 range, that can (essentially) match a Stradivari violins sound, in every way.", "comment_date": "2021-10-25T16:16:58Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Justin Woodford", "comment_text": "I bet it&#39;s not that much better if at all.", "comment_date": "2021-10-25T14:35:27Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "DaddyB", "comment_text": "it&#39;s never the tool / instrument.  it&#39;s always the user that makes it good or bad.  speaking from a photographer&#39;s point of view.  give me a crappy camera that&#39;s not digital and i still out shoot you.", "comment_date": "2021-10-25T11:32:50Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Devin Seitz", "comment_text": "I hate your accent.", "comment_date": "2021-10-25T11:21:03Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "TheMonkdad", "comment_text": "Reminds me of the oenophile studies.

If for instance;  this violin has become as such a configured state because of aging and resonance affecting forces of making thus the wood more supple in some areas more and others less.  Well then if you for instance build it with a sawdust mix with the right ratio of hot glue gun  glue and it leaving you the options of reheating and skimming it or reshaping it;  then eventually;  you should be able to build another one that is exactly like it.  It would really help if having the use of an original one or at least the exact forms of it and weight of the parts and thicknesses.  Cheers.

Sadly TIME is the ultimate factor in it as this makes the wood harder. Some other factors are area where it was produced in its&#39; climate and what type of glue was used. They didn&#39;t have Elmers glue or other modern day adhesives. Mostly they used TREE SAP for it and the finishes were made from the same sandaric resins as available today. Only we now refer to violin finishes as varnish. Also another thing to consider is that they used cat gut or goat innards for the strings.

Why can a cheap guitar sound and play like some of the best guitars? Slight variations in the wood, a slight difference in the thickness of the parts, a variation in the placement of the bracing. So many subtle differences that can improve or destroy the sound characteristics of the instrument. Think of that cheap guitar, it was likely sanded on a thickness sander, the sandpaper was at the beginning, middle, or end of its life. The amount of pressure maybe different, the feed rate may have been changed. In addition, the parts of the guitar are married to other parts, perhaps the Muses smile down on one of ten thousand instruments and make it special. The skilled luthier controls many aspects of the process, but in the end some aspects of the instrument are beyond the control of the maker. <br>A guitar top starts at approximately 9/64ths of an inch. As the top is scraped and sanded the thickness is reduced to about 7/64ths. As the soundboard is thinned the maker taps the top and listens for the overtones. And at some point the top begins to resonate with rich tones as it nears its optimum thickness. The question is: How far do you go? There is a point of no return where the soundboard is stifled and there is nothing that can bring it back. Now think of that factory built guitar that the Muses smiled upon; it went through the thickness sander at the precise setting that produced the perfect resonance, more or less would have produced a lesser sound.", "comment_date": "2021-09-05T13:59:58Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "William Bogue", "comment_text": "For the same reason we can\u2019t create any more original Rembrandt paintings?", "comment_date": "2021-09-05T13:46:44Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Juan Gomez", "comment_text": "Age", "comment_date": "2021-09-05T13:40:30Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Nirakolov", "comment_text": "Pre-vid comment:  You can&#39;t make new Stradivaris anymore than you can make new Shakespeares... it&#39;s not about quality, it&#39;s about literally actually doing it", "comment_date": "2021-09-05T13:29:28Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Gary K", "comment_text": "anyone consider a heat treating of the woods over a few days so as to not overly dry the wood out, just enough to get it from being freshly cut &quot;wet wood&quot;??  another thing to consider what was in his workshop and what tools were there.  clues all.", "comment_date": "2021-09-05T13:24:43Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "seansverige", "comment_text": "<i>&quot;Cometeer - coffee to watch the world burn / drown by&quot;</i>  (delete as applicable) <br>Disappointing.

While all violins are the same sizen and shape of a Strad, give or take a few millimeters. Violas, on the other hand, range from 15&quot; all the way to 22&quot; with drastically different shapes, contours, f-holes, etc. So a violin sounds like a Strad because someone decided that violins MUST sound like Strads.", "comment_date": "2021-09-04T00:32:39Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Growlus notneeded", "comment_text": "Get an audio engineer to measure the frequency and the tone, and it comes down to the dumbass nostalgia", "comment_date": "2021-09-04T00:31:13Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "NIGHTOWL 1963", "comment_text": "I heard the bow strings were made from natural beautiful blonde pubic hair of young virgins.

Magnet field readings should be able to tell if there were differences in the coatings, I mean there just has to be some more data that can be collected without it being too obtrusive. <br>Then the data ran by sound engineers that could tell the finer subtleties by ear and then cross referenced with the physical data. <br>I for one do agree that the wood could be a factor, but again just saying that without being able to analyze the data...<br>I also am sceptical about the blind test, as  violinist myself, you can smell the difference alone when you are playing an older violin, but again we aren&#39;t sure about that data, nor the sample size, quality of ear, etc. <br>I do believe I also heard something about that back then, they valued volume variance to be a supreme factor, so the start of the craze could have been those original ears, in that original times, in the original halls, maybe even putting them in the hands of some of the better players, playing them on certain kind of sheep gut strings, that then put them in the Jones&#39; hands that become a thing of legend that allowed sellers to get premium costs out of them. <br>The reality of the new world it appears to us to be more of a story from the same people that kiss a stone at the top of a castle for luck ffs.

Artists very often have self-esteem issues. They suffer from impostor syndrome and have very little confidence in their actual musical or artistic talent. Probably stemming from the fact that all art is subjective and what constitutes good is not universal. Many need an excuse, a reason to believe that their performance is good enough you deserve to be put on display. And because this doesn&#39;t come from inside themselves they chase equipment.

I have played the piano for 14 years and have played Yamahas, Kawais, Steiways, Faziolis, B\u00f6sendorfers, and more. My former teacher had two grand pianos: a Stuart and Sons and a Fazioli. Both were in great condition and tuned often. Fazioli has a brand reputation on par with, if not higher than Steinway, yet from the first time I played that piano I hated it. I never felt confident on it and could not control the sound in the way I wanted to and thus would make more mistakes on it. Steinways, on the other hand have been generally awesome in my experience. Even when I&#39;m on stage and very nervous, I&#39;m still able to perform at my best on a Steinway grand so long as it&#39;s in good condition.

There are several things that I wish to say about them. First off, neither was the best violin I&#39;ve ever played, even though one was one of the top 25 Strads. Further, there are some Strads which really aren&#39;t that good by anyone&#39;s standards. If you have one of those, you own it because of the name, not because it is a really fine instrument.<br>Another thing one should know about the Strads are that all of them have been modified from the way Antonio Stradivari made them. When he was building violins the neck and fingerboard were shorter, the pitch standard was lower, the angle of the fingerboard was shallower, and the sound which the players of the time were trying for was entirely different. At the time of their making they were  not considered to be all that good. Indeed the instruments of the man who taught him how to make violins, Nicolo Amati, were considered to be far superior. Even to this day there are people (myself included) who find the Amati instruments to be better. Another player of the time who made instruments which surpassed the instruments of Stradivari was Giuseppe Guarneri (aka Guarneri del Jesu). I am actually a violist who occasionally played violin if needed, and one of the two instruments I played professionally was a Guarneir del Jesu viola which was far superior to any Strad I ever laid hands on. It was also an instrument which had managed to remained unaltered since it was made(the other instrument I played was a modern copy of a 17th century instrument, and was made by a very talented modern luthier name Rolland Ross) . <br>I understand why the Strads are so highly considered. They produce a very bright sound, which is highly sought after in the modern orchestra. It is a sound however, which was not sought after until the mid 19th century. Further, you really have to struggle with the instrument in passages where a soft, quiet, delicate sound is required. It&#39;s a great instrument for solo concerto work on pieces written post 1800, but it is definitely the wrong instrument even when converted back to it&#39;s original dimensions, for music of the 18th century and earlier. In the opinion of many artists who try to recreate historically informed performances it is also not the instrument of first choice, even in a solo role. <br>Because of this, one has to wonder if it was the craftsmanship of Antonio Stradivari which make the instruments good, or if it is more a matter of lucky happenstance. I believe it is the latter, and that modern builders would be better served rather than trying to &quot;unlock&quot; the &quot;mystery&quot; of the Strad, to focus instead on making the best instruments they can without it being a copy of anything, and indeed, that&#39;s what the best luthiers today are doing. A lot about how an instrument sounds has to do with how well broken in it was, and how well it was maintained over the years. It&#39;s well known by professional players that a violin or viola which is left unplayed for a long period of time will loose it&#39;s voice, and I&#39;m left to wonder if maybe some of the lower tier Strads may have suffered a fate of going for a long while unplayed.<br>To sum up, having an authentic Strad does not mean you have one of the best instruments out there, and even if you do have one of the best Strads, it is probably a waste of time trying to build an instrument which sounds the same as a Strad, because in time it will sound entirely different than what it sounded like originally, because even the Strads themselves do not sound like they did originally. Nothing will affect the sound of an instrument like the hundreds of years of daily playing does, and there is no way to hurry that process along. The bottom line is that the &quot;Stradivarius sound&quot; is not necessarily the best sound. The best sound is largely a myth, and the quality of sound you get out of the best violins has much more to do with the ability of the performer than it does with the instrument itself. It does have name recognition, and for that reason it is performer bling. But the secret amongst professionals is that there are other instruments available which will serve you just as well, if not better.<br>...and then there&#39;s the bow. But that&#39;s a whole other story for a whole other time.", "comment_date": "2021-09-01T13:31:08Z", "likes_count": 6}, {"comment_by": "Andrew Suryali", "comment_text": "I just want to point out that the test has a flaw that needs to be addressed. That is, the reputation of the Stradivarius violins came from 400 years ago but they were tested against MODERN violins. This, like the sommelier taste tests, ignores the simple fact that nearly everything improves over time, and that the direction of improvements in the realm of arts will tend to head towards closing with the golden standard. Stradivarius violins can&#39;t be differentiated from modern violins because modern violins have gone through 400 years of evolution to get closer and closer to the golden standard set by Stradivarius. Similarly, wine production improvements in the past 60 years or so have tended towards replicating the taste and quality of the expensive wines in the past, to the point that all wines today are pretty much the same. But ask a sommelier to compare an expensive wine from before this wine revolution to its peers and they would quickly identify the expensive one. In fact, you don&#39;t even need sommeliers. Turns out regular people could too. The wines WERE different then, the gap is just gone now. To see whether Strads are actually unique they should be compared to the violins that people had 400 years ago.

He had thickness scales, but not for symmetry. He did it for taper.<br>3. Early in his career, he got a lot of his lumber from SCRAPS by the doc. While Guineri was rich, Stradivari came from a poor family (his father was a relief carver). He actually used pine, cedar and oak on some of his instruments.<br>4. Stradivari had bad eyes and amazing ears. Thanks to his father\u2019s job, he also was a master at sharpening blades, so his tools carved easily instead of stressing the wood from slightly dull blades (MAKES A HUGE DIFFERENCE).<br>5. His 1st 2 instruments were both 10 string guitars. Inspired by seeing them at a doc being played by a Spanish sailor, the instrument was SHUNNED in Italia, and his mentor SMASHED both of them.<br>6. He didn\u2019t make just violins. He made cellos, violas, double bass, viola da gamba (but those are all gone forever). He even got commissioned to make instruments fir entire orchestras (by royalties).<br>7. He didn\u2019t own anything to read because HE COULDN\u2019T READ.\ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2642\ufe0f But he was friends with his neighbors and learned a lot about how (for example) acidic fruit blackens carbon steel.\ud83e\udd14 This got him into experimenting with how certain plants stain or effect woods. Fir example, broccoli was high in IRON (so was moss). Plants like blueberries, black pepper and basil. (Don\u2019t play with your food!\ud83d\udc4a)<br>8. Not only could he not read, he also couldn\u2019t count.\ud83e\udd26\u200d\u2642\ufe0f He used calipers to measure things (like binding one piece flush to another piece), but he never wrote it down!\ud83e\udd26\u200d\u2642\ufe0f He literally didn\u2019t know!<br>9. By working by ear instead of making them within certain measurements, Stradivarius instruments came in various subtle differences in measurements. It was never about them all being the same sizes and shapes. It was always THE SOUND.<br>10. Taking a cue from Michelangelo (the stone statue carver), Antonio would stare at a piece of wood, examine it until he decided what it would be good for. A LOT of his instruments wood grains are\u2026 well\u2026 um\u2026 UGLY. They\u2019re boring!\ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2642\ufe0f His competition would by the most beautiful, curly maple, burl woods with exotic grains. They\u2019d take these pieces they bought for beauty and carve them until they got a decent tone. Antonio\u2026 He\u2019d take that ugly wood he he chose for (whatever instrument he thought a piece was good for) and pull what was in his head right out of the plank.<br><br>So while everyone were making pretty instruments and trying to make them sound as good as they looked, Stradivari was making beautiful SOUNDING instruments, and trying to make them LOOK as good as they SOUNDED.<br>(conclusion) FORM FOLLOWS FUNCTION.<br>And that\u2019s Stradivari. \ud83d\udc4f", "comment_date": "2021-08-31T15:51:41Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "TJ", "comment_text": "yea this totally reeks of a subjective art kind of placebo and not that they are actually better violins", "comment_date": "2021-08-31T15:51:14Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "the eternal student", "comment_text": "I wonder why the knowlege was not passed down to his descendants.

To use both is redundant and is neither/nor but quite the opposite, in fact.<br><br>FYI: Having analysed the sonic characteristics of the violin (the &quot;Strad&#39; among them) the unique quality of the violin sound  is difficult to &quot;hear&quot;, unless one is blessed with a rare &quot;ear&quot;. To wit: If one plays middle C, the C above middle C has twice the amplitude of the played note, with a resultant upward &quot;energy shift&quot; of Harmonic partials. The ear &quot;hears&quot; the played note (dominant) but it is &quot;colored&quot; by the boosted energy of the accessory (+) octave. It is perceptual &quot;dissonance&quot; which provokes a &quot;visceral&quot; response, which can, in some instances, provoke the emotional response unique to the instrument. The sonic profile unique to any instrument is  established in the energy balance of harmonic partials within the sound &quot;envelope&quot;. In true sound synthesis (as opposed to electronically SIMULATED) a guitar can be &quot;glissed&quot;  (shifted) to sound like a trumpet by adjusting the balance of odd and even-numbered partials and their relative energy, via the rule of sums and differences. <br>The Strad (at least the two that were tested) has a unique  energy balance in the even-numbered partials (esthetically pleasing) and an energy &quot;boost&quot; on the partials bass end, two octaves below the played note. Although an &quot;autopsy&quot; of the Strads tested was strictly precluded, trace mineral salts (alumina among them) in the wood, (we believed) was the result of &quot;pickling&quot; prior to seasoning (drying) the blank. These combined  elements would have required a slow process, commenced several years before the blank could be shaped, primarily by scraping... not to mention the choice of &quot;China&quot; lacquer: made from the carapace of the lacquer beetle. Of note: we did not rely solely on electronic devices to test the sonic qualities of the Strad, but enlisted the abilities of a concert violinist, who could detect a tonic variance (off-tune) of 1/8 of a partial in a played note.

All of them have been through series of repairs and patches and have been serviced by luthiers over the centuries.  That&#39;s not even counting how the wood itself has aged.  Second, the design of the bridge -- which is critically important to how the instrument sounds -- that Stradivari used is not really the one used on any violin, including Stradivarius instruments, today.  The modern violin/viola bridge is actually Guarneri&#39;s design and what Stradivari used bears more resemblance to a modern cello bridge.  That means it&#39;s an absolute certainty that they sounded quite different in the 1600s than they do today even apart from all the servicing and age.  Thirdly, Stradivari experimented with loads of designs.  His early instruments were much closer to the Amati designs, but they changed over the years and he tried experiments with different shapes and designs without cornices.<br><br>The notion that Stradivari never wrote down his &quot;process&quot; is not entirely correct.  He left behind loads of writings and diagrams and drawings.  It&#39;s just that he felt that the design and shape of the instrument and the design of the bridge was the most important thing.  If there was any process of treating the wood that he used but didn&#39;t write down, it would be because it wasn&#39;t new or at least he didn&#39;t personally invent it.  Before Strads and Guarneris, Amatis and Stainer violins were the prized ones.  Both Bach and Mozart themselves had Stainer violins.  They lost popularity when orchestras and venues got bigger and there was a need for soloists to have instruments that projected more with more power.<br><br>Also, I&#39;m a little curious about the mention of Guarneri being &quot;just as old&quot;, but with no mention of how Guarneri del Gesu violins compare.  In spite of the fact that Stradivarius carries the bigger name, actual violinists tend to view this comparison as a toss-up and down to personal preference.  I happen to be one of those who prefers the sound of del Gesu violins to that of Stradivarius (and both makers&#39; violins will sell for 8 figure prices), but that is a matter of personal taste.  Guarneri&#39;s tend to be a bit more resonant in the lower harmonics and some of that just comes down to size -- Guarneri often toyed with taller ribs and broader upper bouts.<br><br>I feel like the most important thing that people miss is that even the &quot;old masters&quot; were willing to mess with the design of the instrument.  There&#39;s actually a lot of room to play with the design of a violin/viola and still have something that is really good.  We look back at the Strads and try to say &quot;let&#39;s try to copy this,&quot; without ever asking the question &quot;*why* did he do that?&quot;.  People are too buried in tradition and this idea that Stradivari already perfected the bowed string instrument, and there is nothing more to do.  When in reality, he was willing to try new things, as was Guarneri...  when nobody does that today, you end up stuck in a rut of trying to go backwards instead of forward.  If you look at any of the violins made by Julius Zoller, for instance, you&#39;d find something that looks utterly alien with its sound holes in the ribs and sympathetic string through the center of the bridge and all sorts of things that the likes of TwoSet would call sacrilegious...  and yet, for that, it produces a sound that sounds quite astonishingly mature and by no means out of place in any orchestra.  It&#39;s not a million-dollar instrument, but it would easily stand middle of the pack in a field of modern professional-grade instruments.", "comment_date": "2021-08-31T06:47:24Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Swallowtail Photo Studio", "comment_text": "In regards to violins and wine, here is my take on it.  Strads are undoubtedly exceptional violins and had construction techniques that not only helped make it better but also distinctive.

In modern times we have access to materials, technology, techniques, and capital to produce fine instruments in mass quantities and exceptional instruments in limited production.<br><br>Similarly for famous, expensive wines, none of them would be called bad wines, at worse you may say they are not good value.

It\u2019s the result of the instruments being treated with chemicals, several of which have now been identified for the first time.<br><br>After years of research, Joseph Nagyvary, a professor emeritus of biochemistry at Texas A&amp;M, first proposed and proved the theory nearly 40 years ago. It was not so much the skill of making the instrument, but rather the chemicals used in the process that accounted for the unmatched sound of those created by Stradivari and others such as Guarneri del Gesu. The chemicals were used due to a worm infestation at the time.<br><br>Nagyvary\u2019s findings at the time were verified in a review by the American Chemical Society, the world\u2019s largest scientific organization, the report\u00a0said.<br><br>Current findings by an international team led by Hwan-Ching Tai, professor of chemistry at National Taiwan University, have been published in Angewandte Chemie International Edition.<br><br>The findings of the research team show that the chemicals used to treat the wood used in the instruments were \u201cborax, zinc, copper, and alum\u2014along with lime water,\u201d the news outlet\u00a0reported.<br><br>Nagyvary\u00a0noted\u00a0the use of borax as a preservative goes back to the ancient Egyptians who used it in \u201cmummification and later as an insecticide.\u201d He\u00a0added\u00a0due to widespread worm infestations at the time, both Stradivari and Guarneri would have wanted to treat their violins to \u201cprevent worms from eating away the wood.\u201d Each would have his own \u201chome-grown methods\u201d for the wood\u2019s treatment, in collaboration with \u201cthe local drugstore and druggist at the time.\u201d<br><br>\u201cThis new study reveals that Stradivari and Guarneri had their own individual proprietary method of wood processing, to which they could have attributed a considerable significance,\u201d Nagyvary\u00a0said.<br>It\u2019s\u00a0reportedly\u00a0possible they became aware the special salts they used for permeating the wood also imparted to it \u201csome beneficial mechanical strength and acoustical advantages.\u201d Therefore, the methods \u201cwere kept secret,\u201d adding a \u201ccompetitive advantage\u201d over other instrument makers", "comment_date": "2021-08-31T05:44:00Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "44Nifty", "comment_text": "So is this where the Minecraft record &#39;strad&#39; comes from?", "comment_date": "2021-08-31T05:41:54Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Bonita Jeffrey", "comment_text": "I bet he peed on them.

It was also common to store log in water such as a pond until it was ready to be dried and cut. Its thought microbes would eat the soft parts of the wood during this time. Well in the north american logging industry lakes and rivers were used to flow wood from forests to mills but occasionally water logged old growth wood could sink so there is a modern industry for recovering sunken old growth logs for high end furniture. Allegedly this wood makes an incredible music instrument. The only reason we cant just grow wood to treat in some way that reproduces the effects of this wood is that the tree growth must be slower.

I&#39;m a big synth fan and everyone is always fighting over digital hardware recreations of vintage analog synths, or software versions of vintage analog synths. Many people claim they can hear a &#39;harsh and digital sound&#39; with the digital / software versions but when given a blind poll most results come up as 50/50% right/wrong, and then people blame it on streaming audio compression. My opinion: if you can&#39;t hear the difference streaming it online they might as well sound the same since everyone streams music nowadays. Plus non-musicians won&#39;t pick up on most of the details enthusiasts or pro&#39;s will notice.<br><br>So why buy analog or vintage synths? 1. the digital / software versions all sound the same and are based off of 1 particular unit typically, where as vintage versions of synths (or any instrument really) are going to have a character based on decades of aging. 2. in music how the artist feels actually matters. every piece of gear inspires its own writing style which can be amazing. Using the software version doesn&#39;t give the same tactile feel and using a modern recreation doesn&#39;t make you feel like you&#39;re using something special and rare. When you&#39;re turning emotions and feelings into a sound, your headspace matters a great deal in the writing / recording process. 3. some gear will change tuning based on temperature, even modern analog gear. Digital vintage instruments use older chips that cause unique aliasing or have a low bit depth, and the unique combination of these elements can really change the sound. This CAN be modeled in software in many cases but often its not, and most instruments don&#39;t have modern recreations or software versions. 4. its just cool to own something rare and special if you have the cash. Obviously Stradivari is one of the most extreme versions of this.<br><br>I would imagine when it comes to Stradivarius violins many of these things apply. Special combinations of wood, lots of aging, the inspiration a performer has when playing something so rare and special. Even if in a blind test people don&#39;t choose it as the &#39;better&#39; violin, it&#39;s relatively likely that due to these qualities it at least sounds unique.

Don&#39;t just mention Guarneri with only a passing remark that he was a contemporary. Truth be told the Guarneri del Gesu violins are held by many to be better than Strads. The two greatest violinists of all time, Heifetz and Paganini, owned multiples of both Strads and Guarneri&#39;s and both preferred the latter. For my money, the two greatest sounding violins of all time are the  ex-Pagaini &quot;Il Canone&quot; and the ex-Vieuxtemps that Heifetz played in the final years of his career. Utterly amazing!  Neither is privately owned (Paganini donated his violin to his home town of Genoa upon his death and deserving violinists are still allowed to play it; upon Hefetz&#39;s death, the violin was gifted to an association and is lent to the concert master of the San Francisco Symphony). If either ever came up for sale, who knows what price they would command. I would expect it would surpass the current record which is north of 30 million dollars. I am myself a classically trained violinist and have had the enormous honour of playing a Strad and a Guarneri. The Strad (at the time) was worth about 8 million dollars. The Guarneri had gone through some major repairs and was worth in the hundreds of thousands of dollars, in comparison. Even knowing the price gap, I would take that Guarneri every day of the week.  One final thought, Stradivari worked as a violin maker for many, many decades. Not every instrument that left his shop was of equal quality. Indeed, for instruments from his later period, it is not known how involved he was personally in the instrument&#39;s construction; it may be as much a product of a student or apprentice as of Stradivari himself. I have spoken to my luthier about Strads on a few occasions. He has mentioned working on a few Strads that were kind of clunkers.
