The amount of kinetic energy in your body is essentially the same in both dives. And it takes an equivalent amount of energy to bring your falling body to a stop whether all at once (a belly flop) or spread out over time (a perfect swan dive). The correct concept is impulse - or net force over time. It takes the same amount of net force over time to stop your falling body. Further, the capacity of the water to push back is constant. This can be quantified as force per square inch. In a swan dive the force applied is only over a very few square inches. Hence you slice through the water because the force is insufficient to cause much deceleration. In a belly flop, the force per square inch is the same, just applied over a much wider area. So, strictly speaking, you experience the same amount of force no matter how you hit the water. In a belly flop It&#39;s just compressed into a smaller time interval and over a larger surface area. The peak instantaneous force is higher, but the total force is the same. <br><br>All this said, it is still not a complete explanation because of things like shearing forces in the water, surface tension, etc.", "comment_date": "2017-07-23T20:05:21Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "DKDarts", "comment_text": "Screw you newton", "comment_date": "2017-07-23T13:41:25Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "premier69", "comment_text": "to the religious: blame god", "comment_date": "2017-07-23T06:30:28Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "S P", "comment_text": "anyone notice he is getting fatter", "comment_date": "2017-07-21T07:19:18Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "brandon castro", "comment_text": "Yo, homies i like what you do, I&#39;ll pay you $10 you tell me why asprin and medicine taste bad?

I dismissed that encounter because of absolutely no reason, but I knew I was in denial, since I did shoot a blue shell at him once and he got hurt really badly since lakitu didn&#39;t make it in time (he fell off a cliff because of the blue shell). He got really hurt because of me, after that day I lost contact from Mario and his family, and strangely, a week later after this whole ordeal, I lost all contact from the Boys Squad and the Marie Fanclub. At first I was scared, but that was 6 months ago, and I&#39;ve moved on, but I have noticed that Luigi wasn&#39;t participating in many tournaments like Mario and co... But as a friend once told me, &quot;the past always comes back to you&quot;, but I hoped that this wasn&#39;t going to apply to me. That night I had a dream involving abstract shapes, numbers, mysterious flashing colors, in the dream I was aware of me being in a dream, and of everything for some reason, like I was aware of my breathing, heartbeat, thinking, existance, it was a wierd sensation, then five sphere came up to me and opened like eyes, but they were completely white. Then everything became dark all of a sudden, and shortly after I woke up terribly, with a dry throat, sweaty, sleepy eyes, but the wierdest thing was that I had an air conditioning installed, but even wierder... it was off, even though I turned it on last night. I shrugged it off as it being that the power went out or something. I then was preparing for a meeting I was having with a friend of mine, but an hour later, he called saying &quot;I can&#39;t come, something came up&quot; and then he hanged up, then he wouldn&#39;t answer. So I decided to take a walk outside.<br><br>When I came outside I felt something off about the air around me, but I shrugged it off. When I came to town, I saw a store with a TV showing the tournaments, and in the first time in a long time, I saw Luigi participating again, I kinda felt happy that he started racing again, after the incident 6 months ago, in the back of my mind I thought that he might of developed depression or something, since he&#39;s not been racing in a long time and he got hurt really bad. Anyways, I decided to enter said store and I saw a bunch of comic books, so I bought em&#39;, they costed 5 bucks, but then the guy said 6 bucks, I asked and he said that they were always 6 bucks, and I look again, and he was right, then I go to pay, and he says 4 bucks now, and on the walls around it, it actually says 4 bucks, I was obviously startled, as the man asked about my sanity, but I decided not to buy anything after all, and I shrugged it off. Then I went to the food court and I fell for no reason, and I shrugged it off. I decided not to get anything aside from some pizza, and it was indeed delicious. So I decided to go home.<br><br>As I went home, I started to hallucinate, flashing lights, wierd shapes, the sun as it was setting, turned blue, and then I couldn&#39;t almost tell it apart from the sky, then the sun was back to normal, and it was midday. Then I saw Luigi apperently, but I was not sure if he was real. Then the ground started to shake, and I fell down through a crack in the ground. It was dark. I then fell on a field of grass, and next to that field, I saw some mountains, and some guy next to me was saying, &quot;my names Steve, and climb them please&quot; I assumed that he meant the mountains, so I tried, it took me 5 hours, I didn&#39;t know how I knew that, considering that I didn&#39;t have my phone, when I finally climbed them, I passed out, and woke up in a hospital. When I look around, I see that it&#39;s daytime, and when I see my phone, I go check on it, and see that it&#39;s 4 months ago, as if I time traveled. I couldn&#39;t shrug this off for some reason, so I tried to move, but I could too much, and I was in a bed. The door started to move, and I saw my family, they were for some reason, really happy to see me, I didn&#39;t complain, and I felt a happiness that I never felt in a long time.
