She was startlingly intelligent, and on several occasions she obeyed voice commands she&#39;d never heard before, and she was possibly the best guard animal I have ever seen, but she required constant discipline and correction.  On the whole, I found the experience of owning her to be good, but I would caution anyone that wants a wolf puppy to be willing to speak their language and not just rely on scolding or other &quot;humane&quot; correctional measures.  Wolves establish dominance by nipping ears and holding the other wolf&#39;s mouth shut with their own.  If you&#39;re not willing to pinch your wolf pup&#39;s ear, or even bite it in extreme cases, you will not have the respect of your wolf.  I know some may find the administration of pain to be cruel, but I assure you that a wolf or wolf hybrid will not respect a stern scolding, and will be potentially quite dangerous if not kept in line by methods they understand.
