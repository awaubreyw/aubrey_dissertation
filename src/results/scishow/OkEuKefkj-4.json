This may sound radical, maybe even downright ridiculous to some. Bears hibernate and are still able to give birth because one of their two systems of brain activity is still active. The main part is redistributing energy back into a galactic system that is far greater than we can comprehend in our current state. The squirrel pays back about the same as the bear, relative to its size and weight. This is the same process every human on the planet goes through every time their head is put down and they fall asleep. It\u2019s why the periodical cicada sleeps for 13 to 17 years at a time. That\u2019s why all life, including plants and fungi, sleep and or hibernate. Have any of you ever wondered why do we sleep for about 7 hours per night? It\u2019s obvious that it serves an evolutionary disadvantage to all people and animals, yet we all still do it. We have zero control over our sleep. We can do our best to fight it, but in a very short period, we\u2019d drop dead. Let us remember that energy cannot be created or eliminated. Every living creature must pay back what is due in order for everything to function. It has always been this way. We cannot change it and it is not open for debate.
