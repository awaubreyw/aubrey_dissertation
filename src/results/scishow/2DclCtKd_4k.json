In summary a whole new organ was formed probably as some combination of benign genetic drift turned beneficial. It also as noted comes with the curious quirk that birds can make two different  sounds independently as they have a pair of vocal organs rather than a single one which is the defining characteristic of song birds.", "comment_date": "2020-10-21T22:00:02Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Fuzzy B.
