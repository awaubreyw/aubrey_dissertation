They\u2019re basically skinnier, wigglier versions of their relatives, the sea stars. But those are not the only ways they differ from their meatier cousins. Sea stars have eyes\u2014one at the end of each arm. But brittle stars are eyeless, so clearly they must not be as cool, right? Except, it turns out they can see. Just with their skin instead of eyes! Vision seems like it would be pretty simple: if you have eyes, you can see. If you don\u2019t have eyes, you cannot. But eyes are just a really advanced form of photoreception: the ability to perceive light. And there\u2019s lots of animals on our planet that do not have eyes that can still sense light. And it has a name! It\u2019s known as extraocular photoreception. Basically, they can sense light with other parts of their bodies, either in addition to or instead of having eyes. The brittle star Ophiocoma wendtii, is one such creature. These brainless, shy animals spend their time hanging out in dark crevices of coral reefs. And they know they\u2019re in those crevices because they can react to light and shadow using their skin. Until recently, scientists thought that crystal-like structures in their skin worked together like a big compound eye. Essentially, they believed the crystals could focus light onto nerves running all over the brittle star\u2019s body, and that allowed the animals to form images of their environment. And they believed that because they thought there was this big network of nerves running below the crystals. But once they took a closer look with high-tech microscopes, they found that these nerves actually run in between the crystals. Which sinks the whole crystals-focusing-light on them idea. However, they also found that the skin on their arms contains lots of cells filled with light-sensitive proteins called opsins. And it turns out these are in close contact with those nerves. So now, biologists think these cells allow the brittle star to detect light. Basically, when light hits those light-sensitive proteins, the cells send a signal to the nerves, and that causes the brittle star to react. Which, in their case, generally means moving out of the spotlight and back into the dark. It\u2019s still not fully known how exactly the nerves produce this response, what with the animals lacking a brain. And they aren\u2019t sure whether brittle stars can see shapes or just experience light and shadow. But they\u2019re eager to learn more, because there are lots of cases where we would like machines to see without relying on a central control system. It could help cut down the circuitry needs of mobile robots, for example, since they wouldn\u2019t need to send all information to their centralized \u201cbrains\u201d to process. And it might make the machines better at tolerating and adapting to damage. Basically, much like brittle stars, localized injuries wouldn\u2019t have as big an impact on their overall ability to function\u2014an idea known as graceful degradation. So not only do brittle stars have the superpower of seeing without eyes, they might be able to show us how to design robots with that same ability, so that they can travel into dangerous environments and perform all sorts of helpful tasks. And that makes these eyeless, boneless, brainless animals anything but boring. Thanks for watching this episode of SciShow, which is sponsored by Brilliant.

I&#39;m pretty sure someone is about to bring my butt to school on this subject. This particular subject I&#39;m an idiot on and feel very stupid. So if you want to really make fun of me that&#39;s fine by me. <br>  So back to these pretty much mindless creatures. I watched bees flap their wings and seen how they are pretty much able to talk to each other. They will defend their homes to the death if they need too. Ants are close but don&#39;t have the wings and I guess just go by smell. Now me personally, I&#39;m allergic to them and especially fire ants which my yard has at least 6 or 7 ant mounds. I was going to kill them all but have left them be. They do keep away other little bugs I hate worse, like ticks!!! Now if I see a line of them on my steps outside and I&#39;m sitting there. I&#39;ll squash one and when the next ant walks up to the dead ant. Well the poor ant will go freaking crazy and start running all over the place. It&#39;s almost like they know that death is coming!!! Then later the ants will show up and drag their brothern back home, which I&#39;m guessing to give it a funeral and bury it. I don&#39;t know, they might be just bringing it back to eat, but they always get their dead and bring them back home.
