Only one latent state can be observed at a time. This observation transitions according to a continuous-time markov process. In the case of the devil&#39;s staircase, we have two states: one has Poisson rate parameter of zero as it produces no activity while the other states has a positive rate. This is the Interrupted Poisson Process. It has interesting properties such as producing self-similarity (burstiness) which is why it is often used to model the arrival of data packets or bursty urban traffic. It has similar algorithms related to Hidden Markov Models (generally used to decide genome sequences or speech signals) in that it can also decode hidden states. It is a model that is good at telling you what happened and where you are know as well as what the single next step might be.

Hence, why you are at best making a prediction about the likelihood of such an event happening in any given location over a time period (which is what they are sort of going on about).  More to the point, when you get one big quake, you almost always get a bunch of smaller (parasitic) quakes/movements along the fault plane soon after.  <br><br>Admittedly, it makes sense, when you get strain build up, you will start getting lots of micro events that are likely indicators of something big coming (and again, applicable to lots of other fields), but, like I said, there are a few missing details that would help me understand things.<br><br>Also, I think Australia has had one Magnitude 6 quake in the last 30 years (in Newcastle)....
