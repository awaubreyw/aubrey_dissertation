It provides a guideline we can strive to emulate.  And yet, few ever contemplate or appreciate the source of such masterful design.  Seldom is asked the question, &quot;How likely is it that natural selection of random point mutations could actually cause such magnificent, sublime, clever and beautiful design?&quot;<br><br>Besides the fine qualities mentioned in this video, contemplate metamorphosis of a caterpillar into a butterfly.  How could random point mutations ever cause that ability to begin to exist?  There are thousands of radical steps needed to transform into an entirely different type of creature.  One cannot write the code for this piecemeal.  An incomplete metamorphosis is not going to result in a creature more suited to survival than a caterpillar or likely any sort of functional creature at all.  It is all or nothing and that is too much for the gradualism evolutionary theory uses as an excuse for the unlikelihood of what it is claims to accomplish.<br><br>Then of course how could natural selection of random point mutations result in crucial instinctive knowledge?  Within a minute a newly emerge butterfly knows it can fly and how to do it, where to find and how to eat nectar (an entirely different type of food than it has ever know before), how to successfully gain a mate and where to migrate to thousands of miles away.  So many vital abilities and knowledge it has to have without learning or being taught.<br><br>All this knowledge and the wonderful design found everywhere, which we do well to seek to learn from, are far beyond what accidental genetic mistakes could ever produce.  Often too much change and new knowledge must be gained upon the instant of a radical transition for natural selection of mistakes to ever be plausibly be given credit for.  For example, it is presumed land animals became marine mammals such as dolphins and whales.  These must sleep with half their brain at a time so that the other half can keep swimming and surfacing to breathe.  That&#39;s something you have to get 100% correct from day one or you will drown.  Those are abilities totally unneeded until the instant you use them for the first time and then they must be completely functional.  That is not how evolution is supposed to work.  One doesn&#39;t save up a vast set of changes in case a descendant might one day radically change its lifestyle.  Let&#39;s say all these required changes were finally complete.  How do you know you can now sleep in the water with half your brain still swimming?  I&#39;ll bet you&#39;ve never tried it just in case you could.  Why would any creature?  You would have to also lose all the instinctive reactions which normally prevent this.<br><br>Anyway, I love the wonderful science and design everywhere and always get a bit bugged when no credit it given to the Great Designer all of this points to.  Design requires a Designer.  Information requires a Source.  Credit keeps being given to natural selection of random mutations when that is not really a functional method of gaining completely new abilities, instinctive knowledge and other radical transformations.  I&#39;m not into being ungrateful.  Give credit where credit is due.<br><br>(Revelation 4:11) \u201cYou are worthy, Jehovah our God, to receive the glory and the honor and the power, because you created all things, and because of your will they came into existence and were created.\u201d<br><br>Those to whom the idea of an intelligent, capable designer is anathema, even though that is the only workable explanation, will likely heap insults rather than answer the questions raised or honestly contemplate the limits of what natural selection of random mutations could actually result in.  Let&#39;s see if responses are petty or honest.<br><br>As Harvard evolutionary geneticist Richard Lewontin confessed,\r<br>&quot;It is not that the methods and institutions of science somehow compel us to accept a material explanation of the phenomenal world but, on the contrary, that we are forced by our a prioiri adherence to material causes to create an apparatus of investigation and a set of concepts that produce material explanations, no matter how counter-intuitive, no matter how mystifying to the uninitiated. Moreover, that materialism is absolute for we cannot allow a divine foot in the door.&quot;\r<br><br>Here are  numerous further examples of the wonderful capabilities of nature and asks the natural question &quot;Was it Designed?&quot;<br><a href=\"https://www.jw.org/en/bible-teachings/science/was-it-designed/\">https://www.jw.org/en/bible-teachings/science/was-it-designed/</a>", "comment_date": "2021-04-22T18:29:17Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Andrew Hetchler", "comment_text": "Commie propiganda", "comment_date": "2021-04-21T22:33:51Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Jay", "comment_text": "Avoid a climate disaster by charging corporations.
