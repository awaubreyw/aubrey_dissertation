Inoculation (variolation) != vaccination/vaccine. Vaccination/vaccine!= immunization. Immunization !=inoculation. I\u2019m aware some sources try to make these words the same, but they are not. They have differences, but, they are interrelated.<br><br>SciShow: \u201cThe credit should go to Onesimus [as the first significant American figure in medicine]\u201d<br>Also SciShow: \u201cBut the concept of a vaccine had already existed for a long time\u201d<br><br>Why say we shouldn\u2019t give credit to one person and proceed to give credit to one person?<br><br>This is a bad and highly biased video and poorly researched (piecemealed). Why would Onesimus be given significant credit for spreading knowledge of inoculation (variolation)? He was halfway around the world from Jenner and we have evidence of earlier inoculations (and knowledge of inoculations) in Europe. You\u2019ve written out Emanuel Timonius and John Woodward who spread the information around Europe at approximately the same time (1714) and were far more influential than one man (Onesimus) telling one other man (Mather). Lady Mary Worley Montague also played a significant role in popularization of inoculation in England (1721 by an /old/ Greek practitioner).<br><br>We also have evidence of Greeks (Europeans) practicing inoculation since 1660. We even have evidence of inoculation being practiced in Wales since at least 1600. The earliest written record of variolation in China is only 1549. The claim of inoculation to 1000 CE is disputed. The Chinese method (insufflation) was one of the worst methods of inoculation with a higher mortality rate and disease severity rates versus other methods (such as cutaneous inoculation practiced in India). <br><br>Regardless, the spread of inoculation, in recorded verifiable history, appears to have proliferated/originated in the mid 1500s with the practice spreading widely all the way to NW Europe by 1600.<br><br>Unfortunately, Onesimus likely had, in reality, little to no impact on the popularization or advent of variolation. Arguably, Mathers didn\u2019t either. Still, Mathers would have learned about inoculation at approximately the same time with or without Onesimus.<br><br>Additionally, your downplaying of Jenner\u2019s role is frustrating. He was the first person to prove (and publish/inform others) the possibility of immunizing someone against an infectious disease without giving them that disease (variolation still spread smallpox to others). Also, Jenner didn\u2019t claim to be the first to think of dairymaids contracting cowpox gaining immunity to smallpox - he was the first prove (provide evidence) of it.<br><br>Stop erasing cultures by painting people in broad brushes. People from the same content are not the same people. Onesimus was from modern Libya. During the same time period, people from Southern Africa would likely not have been exposed to knowledge of inoculating. Evidence suggests Japanese didn\u2019t know about inoculation until the 1800s. Just because people reside on the same continent doesn\u2019t mean they\u2019re the same. Also, you display bias when you refer to one group of people by color of skin (white) and others by their nation of origin or continent of origin (African, Chinese, etc.).<br><br>Honestly, this was a pretty bad video. \u201cBut science history is much richer than we\u2019ve been led to believe.\u201d How did you not find better more comprehensive sources? You didn\u2019t even get James Phipps\u2019 age correct - he was eight years of age instead of nine (although I see your CDC source which incorrectly aged James Phipp as nine, many of your own sources correctly list his age as eight). I\u2019m not trying to be overly harsh, but this was a bad video.

It is extremely rare that a single individual or experiment generates a quantum leap in understanding; this &quot;lone genius&quot; paradigm is potentially injurious to the research\r process.&quot;</i><br><i>&quot;Jenner&#39;s work represented the first scientific attempt to control an infectious disease by the deliberate use of vaccination. Strictly speaking, he did not discover vaccination </i><b><i>but was the first person to confer scientific status on the procedure and to pursue its scientific investigation</i></b><i> [mine again]. [...] Benjamin Jesty was neither the first nor the last to experiment with vaccination. In fact, the use of smallpox and cowpox was widely known among the country physicians in the dairy counties of 18th-century England. However, </i><b><i>the recognition of these facts should not diminish our view of Jenner&#39;s accomplishments</i></b><i> [mine again]. It was his relentless promotion and devoted research of vaccination that changed the way medicine was practiced.&quot;</i><br>In the next piece, also by Boylston, he merely claims that <i>&quot;Sadly the milkmaid story is a </i><b><i>lie</i></b><i> [mine emphasis] invented by John Baron, Jenner\u2019s friend and first biographer. Jenner himself never claimed to have discovered the value of cowpox, nor did he ever say, despite a huge volume of correspondence, how he first came across the idea.&quot;</i> He then goes to hypothesize a tentative connection between Fewster and Jenner, but that&#39;s about it.<br>Another critic of Jenner is Horton, who vitriolically writes <i>&quot;The limping truth is that Edward Jenner was a political opportunist who obtained priority in the\r discovery of vaccination (1796) through his reputation (he was elected a fellow of the Royal Society in 1779 on the strength of his research on cuckoos) and aristocratic social standing (he received financial support from the Duke of Bedford and the lord mayor of London).&quot;</i><br>This last one strikes me as <i>ad hominem</i> , considering a quotation from the fifth source: <i>&quot;Jenner was not without faults or without critics. [...] Many of the specific comments made by these and other critics have some substance. [...] This is not the place to adjudicate on these controversies; Baxby (1981) discusses them at length. It seems to the present authors that, whatever its shortcomings and Jenner&#39;s failings, publication of the</i> Inquiry <i>and the subsequent energetic promulgation by Jenner of the idea of vaccination with a virus other than variola virus constituted a watershed in the control of smallpox, </i><b><i>for which he more than anyone else deserves the credit</i></b><i> [mine again].&quot;</i><br><br>As for the last 3 pieces, they speak something interesting about you crying &quot;ideological foul&quot;; again, in order:<br><br><i>&quot;We conducted a demographic analysis by extracting hundreds of human names from common biology textbooks and assessing the binary gender and race of featured scientists. We found that the most common scientists featured in textbooks are white men. [...] We call upon textbook publishers to expand upon the scientists they highlight to reflect the diverse population of learners in biology.&quot;</i><br><i>&quot;Any western medical institution more than a century old and which claims to stand for peace and justice has to confront a painful truth\u2014that its success was built on the savage legacy of colonialism.&quot;</i><br><i>&quot;It&#39;s time to take the &#39;great&#39; white men of science off their pedestals&quot;</i><br><br>So there you go; you&#39;re guilty of dressing up historical revisionism as science in the name of identity politics, and I arrest my case based on the FACTS of the matter...<br><br><b>EDIT</b> : I should also comment on <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtqAqL3fn64&amp;t=9m32s\">9:32</a>-<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtqAqL3fn64&amp;t=10m36s\">10:36</a> .
