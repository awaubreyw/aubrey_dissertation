The score is based on changes from the norm of multiple protein biomarkers including IL-16, a proinflammatory cytokine, soluble Fas, an inducer of apoptosis, and Hepatocyte Growth Factor (HGF)which serves as a marker for chemotaxis of T-cells into epithelium and cardiac tissue, among other markers. Elevation above the norm increases the PULS score, while decreases below the norm lowers the PULS score.The score has been measured every 3-6 months in our patient population for 8 years. Recently, with the advent of the mRNA COVID 19 vaccines (vac) by Moderna and Pfizer, dramatic changes in the PULS score became apparent in most patients.This report summarizes those results. A total of 566 pts, aged 28 to 97, M:F ratio 1:1 seen in a preventive cardiology practice had a new PULS test drawn from 2 to 10 weeks following the 2nd\u00a0COVID shot and was compared to the previous PULS score drawn 3 to 5 months previously pre- shot. Baseline IL-16 increased from 35=/-20 above the norm to 82 =/- 75 above the norm post-vac; sFas increased from 22+/- 15 above the norm to 46=/-24 above the norm post-vac; HGF increased from 42+/-12 above the norm to 86+/-31 above the norm post-vac. These changes resulted in an increase of the PULS score from 11% 5 yr ACS risk to 25% 5 yr ACS risk. At the time of this report, these changes persist for at least 2.5 months post second dose of vac.We conclude that the mRNA vacs dramatically increase inflammation on the endothelium and T cell infiltration of cardiac muscle and may account for the observations of increased thrombosis, cardiomyopathy, and other vascular events following vaccination.", "comment_date": "2021-11-22T14:55:20Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Sheepdog Warrior", "comment_text": "Spike protein level damage of normal DNA process... .is being investigated.", "comment_date": "2021-11-22T03:23:34Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Sheepdog Warrior", "comment_text": "This information is outdated already.", "comment_date": "2021-11-22T03:22:36Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Sheepdog Warrior", "comment_text": "Heart attack device....for free.", "comment_date": "2021-11-22T03:21:15Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "tom69", "comment_text": "keep the death shot", "comment_date": "2021-11-22T01:27:34Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "The Reign of the Zero", "comment_text": "Haha...so you&#39;re saying the mrna research was done and ready to go at the exact time that covid happened?

I did not know that vaccines were given a blanket indemnity from liability in 1986 (they cannot be sued)...... I did not know that we gave more vaccines than any other country.....I did not know that we are the only country that gives newborn babies Hepatitis B vaccines ( against a sexually transmitted disease) on the 1st day of life...I did not know that the US has the highest rate of SIDS in the industrialized world on the 2nd day of life...

I did not know that more college students are getting mumps and measles because they have no protection from these childhood illnesses from their vaccines....I did not know that the measles vaccine only comes in the MMR now but the single version of just the measles vaccine was safer and not causing autism...I did not know that Dr.Wakefield was proven to be right...I did not know that when adults get their DPT vaccines to visit their grandchildren that the &quot;P&quot; pertussis = whooping cough infection is actually still alive in them then and they are then contagious like &quot;Typhoid Mary&#39;&#39;, and these adults are actually carrying the infection and then spreading pertussis=whooping cough...I did not know how emotional the topic would be and how angry people would be at me for just asking questions about Vaccine Safety....I did not know that pediatricians do not even know the vaccine ingredients, like mercury, aluminum, and Human DNA and neurotoxic aluminum molecules and glyphosate.....

It is succinct and exact when acknowledgement and applied knowledge/sciencd is used to alter natural or previous colored hair.

Our cells are fantastic at keeping foreign material out.  Viruses are unfortunately able to by-pass this protection.  In order to get sick by a virus the virus&#39;s genetic material, used to cause the infection, must be protected by a protein coat.  The protein coat also has the ability to by-pass the cell&#39;s defenses and injects the viral genetic material into the cell to begin viral reproduction.  The cell explodes after it gets filled will viral protein coats packaged with viral genetic material and these new viruses go on to attack other cells repeating the process.  Now If I inject you with viral genetic material of any kind only this is rapidly recognized as foreign and destroyed by your immune system.  It can&#39;t get into your cells to start reproduction, producing viruses and thus symptomatic infection because there is NO natural mechanism to do so.  So what is this &quot;carrier&quot; that protects the foreign genetic material AND injects it into one&#39;s cells?  This process is NOT vaccination.  The word vaccination comes from the latin name for smallpox &quot;vaccinia&quot;.  The root of vaccinia is cow as it was discovered that humans injected with cow pox obtained immunity from smallpox and were thus &quot;vaccinated&quot;.  By definition a vaccine is the introduction of weakened or dead organisms by injection to stimulate the immune system.  That&#39;s NOT what any m-RNA injectable does.  These injectables should therefore be termed more correctly as gene therapies NOT as vaccines.  But coming back to the carrier....  I have no doubt that it is feasible.  But what is it?  I think we deserve to know.  I can guarantee nefarious powers would love to have access to the &quot;carrier&quot; to get things into your cells that DON&#39;T belong there thus evading detection in the blood stream.

So if we are becoming viral and contagious with a new variant of the spike protein and our body is continuously fighting it off, common sense and medical research shows that the virus will find a way top survive eventually and begin to mutate to accomplish this.... aka Zeta variant.

There, they &quot;confirm virus isolation&quot; and replication by monitoring the cells for cytopathic effects (destruction) with a microscope and genetic detection of the virus via RT-PCR.<br><br>That is the basic standardized method of what it means to have &quot;isolated&quot; a virus in Virology, which for them serves as proof.<br><br>They believe those methods are sufficient evidence because by checking for certain<br><br>genetic material (they believe is related to a virus) they are able to approximate or match the<br><br>genetic identity or homology of that material to other viruses in their database. In the case of Sars-cov-2, they said it was about an 80% genetic match to Sars-1, which is how they &quot;know&quot; it&#39;s a virus. And by also seeing the cells in the culture die, that all serves as &quot;proof&quot; that they found a virus. They then capture images of the objects they say are viruses under an electron microscope for a final confirmation.<br><br>So in virology: Finding certain genetic material + cytopathic effects + micrographs of particles in a cell culture = we found a virus.<br><br>\u00a0<br><br>WHY THEY ARE WRONG;<br><br>(1) Virologists literally NEVER run an equally treated &quot;&#39;non-infected&quot; cell culture control experiment to compare against the &quot;infected&quot; cell culture. It&#39;s like not having a control group.<br><br>Basic &amp; furndamental science is completely MIA in virology. Dr. Stefan Lanka, renounced virologist recently demonstrated that he gets the same cytopathic effects as these other virologists, all without using Any &quot;infected&quot; material whatsoever. The cells die because of the way virologists are treating them (poisoning and starving the cells).<br><br>Not a virus.<br><br>So we can go ahead and cross &quot;Cytopathic Effects&quot; off the List. <br><br>(2) Sars-cov-2 was &quot;found and isolated&quot; the same way as Sars-1 (one of the main references for sars-2) and every other virus; via indirect unvalidated methods. Most people should realize that isn&#39;t real evidence since virologists never proved they found a virus in the first place. They assume they founda virus<br><br>by comparing it to genetie &quot;virus templates&quot; that were ALSO &quot;found&quot; the same way. It&#39;s like claiming to have found a unicorn based on genetic material that you believe has a genetic similarity to that of a previous unicorn, yet no one ever found an ACTUAL Unicorn to get any genetic material in the first place!<br><br>\u00a0<br><br>(3) Detecting genetic material that&#39;s never been proven to come from a virus does not tell you Where that material came from, so there is no way to prove that it is a virus that invaded someone&#39;s body and caused a disease. It could easily be material that was produced by the body itself or a resut of the cell culture mix.<br><br>\u00a0<br><br>\u00a0<br><br>(4) To date, every published &quot;full genome sequence&quot; has been the in-silico variety, which are all stitched together theoretical computer models of a genome, based on a theoretical virus never proven to exist in reality. And they&#39;re in silico because-&gt;They Never Purified out a Virus. You cant actually sequence a &quot;new&quot; object from end-to-end without first separating out that object. Check any virology paper you want. Every genome is assembled via alignment and de novo techniques with &quot;virus templates&quot; and multiple computer programs. - So between 2, 3, and 4, we can also cross out &quot;Certain Genetic Material&quot;. - Which means we can also cross out those Electron Micrograph images, since we know microscopic particles don&#39;t have &quot;virus&quot; name tags on them.<br><br>\u00a0<br><br>(5) Which brings us to: What they SHOULD be doing (as written in microbiology text books and universally recognized as the Gold Standard of isolation); is taking fluid samples from a diseased person and then filtering through viral sized particles for collection, followed by density gradient centrifugation to create a viral band&quot; around a centrifuge tube. The virus particles (if they existed) could then be extracted from that - thereby ISOLATED &amp; Purified from everything else.<br><br>Afterwards the suspected virus could then be visualized, genetically mapped &quot;sequenced&quot; from end-to-end, and used in properly conducted scientific experiments to determine if it&#39;s the cause of any disease. And Then, IF SO, could be said to be a real life &quot;virus&quot;. You can&#39;t call it a &quot;pathogenic virus&quot; unless you first show this. So taking particles and sequencing their &quot;genome&quot; isn&#39;t even enough. Read any virology paper you want - That has never occurred.<br><br>\u00a0(6) Bottom Line.

This is time limited and so for a period will cause cells to create antigen, build an immune response and then be gone. You achieve the same as injecting the viral antigen direct, as say the AZ vaccine, but as you point out, you enable the body to create the antigen itself rather than having to create it externally and then inject, as most \u2018traditional\u2019 vaccines work.

The human immune system is extremely complex, and I don&#39;t think we should use the world population as lab rats to find out. That is why years of testing is needed instead of this hysteric rush to combat a disease, that has a very low mortality rate in the first place. We should focus on new treatments of those who are the worst hit by the virus, and let our immune system do what it has done for millions of years. \r<br>There are so many reports already of people dying or suffering side effects after taking the vaccine, and then there is the insane censoring being orchestrated by media and big tech through a rampage campaign to quell even sound scientific debates, and direct personal attacks of professionals that ask questions.

If you get legionella bacteria in your body, dilute one tablespoon of borax in a bottle of hot water. Allow cooling.

It is one of the safest drugs known. It is on the WHO\u2019s list of essential medicines, has been given 3.7 billion times around the globe, and won the Nobel prize for its global and historic impacts in eradicating endemic parasitic infections in many parts of the world. Our medical discovery of a rapidly growing published medical evidence base demonstrating its unique and highly potent ability to inhibit SARS-CoV-2 replication and to suppress inflammation, prompted our team to use ivermectin for prevention and treatment in all stages of COVID-19.

In the exercise, the virus is called SPARS, because of the city (St. Paul) where this virus was first discovered. In reality, the new virus will likely be renamed. SPARS will also become a coronavirus, which means that the covid project will actually continue as normal, but with a different name and a &quot;more dangerous&quot; virus. The simulation states that the new virus has spread to animals in Southeast Asia in 2021. This makes it necessary to sacrifice countless animals (to satan) in order to prevent the spread. Vaccines also play a crucial role in this simulation and the vaccine here is called COROVAX. This vaccine will be the version needed to stop the new pandemic. In the coming years, the people will get used to the permanent lockdown and will be forced voluntarily to get more and more vaccinations. By the time the SPARS virus enters the picture in 2025, the population is already used to having to queue for yet another \u201clife-saving vaccine\u201d. 2025 is also the year that almost the whole world will be able to enjoy the fast download of movies, also called 5G, and that would also be the perfect time to take the final step. The COROVAX that everyone wants very much because the new SPARS virus is so dangerous, will then contain the necessary nanoparticles to connect everyone to the cloud. And so we are all heading towards 2030 as mind control slaves. SPARS is of course nothing more than an exercise that already took place in 2017. Just like Event 201 was an exercise that also involved John Hopkins University and took place several weeks before the real bogus pandemic started. Because covid-19 has a limited lifespan and a lot still needs to be done in the field of 5G to be able to connect everyone to the super-fast network and the fact that creep Bill already knows that something is coming that will get our attention this time.

Is this process similar to anything that naturally happens in properly functioning organisms?<br>That is, do cells ever share RNAs between themselves?  Perhaps as part of an antiviral response? e.g. Maybe a cell that&#39;s been triggered to produce an interferon will send RNAs for it along with signals to trigger production more &quot;conventionally?&quot;  The vaccine sounds like a stripped down enveloped RNA virus to me.  That&#39;s why I&#39;m specifying healthy functioning.<br><br>2. How are the produced antigens exposed to the immune system?  Do the cells present them via their  MHC systems, release them to the intercellular fluid, both, or something else entirely?  If MHC presentation is involved, doesn&#39;t that trigger cell execution?  Regardless, isn&#39;t there a potential for RNA vaccines to trigger autoimmune issues down the line?  Is there data on such problems?  What countermeasures have been built into the vaccine, if any?  How do those countermeasures work?  (Also if my hunch is definitely incorrect, please explain where my chain of thought went wrong:<br>1. Vaccine triggers healthy cells to produce antigens. &gt;&gt;&gt; 2. Immune system probably associates cells with antigens possibly destroys cells [based on my incomplete knowledge of immune function].  &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; 3. Also, if healthy cells are destroyed, immune system can be exposed to higher quantities of healthy cell components.  Which could increase likelihood of immune response against those components. &gt;&gt;&gt; 4.

This was just two days after the genetic sequence had been made public in an act of scientific and humanitarian generosity that resulted in China\u2019s Yong-Zhen Zhang\u2019s being temporarily forced out of his lab.

It was completed before China had even acknowledged that the disease could be transmitted from human to human, more than a week before the first confirmed coronavirus case in the United States. By the time the first American death was announced a month later, the vaccine had already been manufactured and shipped to the National Institutes of Health for the beginning of its Phase I clinical trial.
