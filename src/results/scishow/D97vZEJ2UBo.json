Let&#39;s get real--nukes are all Russia has against the US. If Russia\u2019s conventional forces were twice as good as they are, they\u2019d still be half as good as they need to be to give the US a run for its money. As for China, all signs point to its conventional forces being just as much of a paper tiger as Russia&#39;s. Realistically speaking, no country\u2019s conventional forces pose a strategic threat to the US. Yet, against nukes the US seems content to remain helpless. The percentage of defense spending allocated to nuclear defense is so low what else can it be called other than wildly irrational and profoundly irresponsible. I\u2019ve read that the US has fewer bunkers than either tiny Albania or tiny Switzerland. I live in Washington DC. A few minutes ago I googled where to go in case of a nuclear attack. I can find no useful answer. I just see unhelpful comments like \u201cgo to a fall-out shelter\u201d with no info about where fall-out shelters are, what their capacities are, which ones are deepest, best fortified, etc. If nukes were really about to fly in 15 minutes, I suppose I\u2019d run to the closest metro stop (the subway), but to where should I take it? Which direction should I head? Which metro lines would take me to an above-ground stop where death awaits? Where can one find iodine pills agains radiation sickness? I can\u2019t find any answers. Why hasn\u2019t the US spent five-hundred dollars to create a webpage with this kind of information. It\u2019s as if long ago the US decided that there\u2019s no point in even trying to survive a nuclear war given that whatever we do millions of us will die. If half of us will die, there\u2019s no point in the other half surviving. What kind of nonsense is that?! Why do we make no effort whatsoever to save the tens of millions of American lives that could be saved? We spend astronomical amounts to develop fighter jets so advanced that fighter pilots won\u2019t get shot down, thereby saving tens or hundreds of American lives. So why do we spend almost nothing to save tens of millions of American civilians from incineration and radiation poisoning?!", "comment_date": "2022-03-13T19:30:41Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Dan. a.k.a.bradpitt", "comment_text": "[------------------&gt; WARNING  :    Here is something you do not know.   1.

Russia has invested heavily and has fast tracked these programs so as of today they are in service and ready to go right now. Russia has essentially eliminated MAD .

A failed MAD equals russia and possibly others , continue on with life , regardless if it will never be the same again on earth. America will be a hot pile of ash, every single person , because of our military and our political leaderships failure to address how to keep our lives going in a armed conflict. They are not doing nearly enough , in regards to our lives , maybe theirs considering the emergency underground shelters they have , but we on the other hand , are not provided. Why do Americans say nothing about this ? Are we really that stupid ? Complacent ? Careless ? YES , and for that reason , it is our own fault . Russia has again FAST tracked these programs and are now pushing to re shape the territory back to its former state of 1988.

In the United States, it was first identified in military personnel in spring 1918. It is estimated that about 500 million people or one-third of the world\u2019s population became infected with this virus. The number of deaths was estimated to be at least 50 million worldwide with about 675,000 occurring in the United States.<br><br>In February 1957, a new influenza A (H2N2) virus emerged in East Asia, triggering a pandemic (\u201cAsian Flu\u201d). This H2N2 virus was comprised of three different genes from an H2N2 virus that originated from an avian influenza A virus, including the H2 hemagglutinin and the N2 neuraminidase genes. It was first reported in Singapore in February 1957, Hong Kong in April 1957, and in coastal cities in the United States in summer 1957. The estimated number of deaths was 1.1 million worldwide and 116,000 in the United States.<br><br>1968 Pandemic (H3N2 virus)\r<br>Espa\u00f1ol\r<br>woman working in lab\r<br>The 1968 pandemic was caused by an influenza A (H3N2) virus comprised of two genes from an avian influenza A virus, including a new H3 hemagglutinin, but also contained the N2 neuraminidase from the 1957 H2N2 virus. It was first noted in the United States in September 1968. The estimated number of deaths was 1 million worldwide and about 100,000 in the United States. Most excess deaths were in people 65 years and older. The H3N2 virus continues to circulate worldwide as a seasonal influenza A virus. Seasonal H3N2 viruses, which are associated with severe illness in older people, undergo regular antigenic drift.<br><br>The 2009 H1N1 Pandemic: A New Flu Virus Emerges\r<br>The (H1N1)pdm09 virus was very different from H1N1 viruses that were circulating at the time of the pandemic. Few young people had any existing immunity (as detected by antibody response) to the (H1N1)pdm09 virus, but nearly one-third of people over 60 years old had antibodies against this virus, likely from exposure to an older H1N1 virus earlier in their lives. Since the (H1N1)pdm09 virus was very different from circulating H1N1 viruses, vaccination with seasonal flu vaccines offered little cross-protection against (H1N1)pdm09 virus infection. While a monovalent (H1N1)pdm09 vaccine was produced, it was not available in large quantities until late November\u2014after the peak of illness during the second wave had come and gone in the United States. From April 12, 2009 to April 10, 2010, CDC estimated there were 60.8 million cases (range: 43.3-89.3 million), 274,304 hospitalizations (range: 195,086-402,719), and 12,469 deaths (range: 8868-18,306) in the United States due to the (H1N1)pdm09 virus.\r<br>\r<br>Disease Burden of the H1N1pdm09 Flu Virus, 2009-2018\r<br>Since the 2009 H1N1 pandemic, the (H1N1)pdm09 flu virus has circulated seasonally in the U.S. causing significant illnesses, hospitalizations, and deaths.\r<br>\r<br>Additionally, CDC estimated that 151,700-575,400 people worldwide died from (H1N1)pdm09 virus infection during the first year the virus circulated.** Globally, 80 percent of (H1N1)pdm09 virus-related deaths were estimated to have occurred in people younger than 65 years of age. This differs greatly from typical seasonal influenza epidemics, during which about 70 percent to 90 percent of deaths are estimated to occur in people 65 years and older.\r<br>\r<br>Though the 2009 flu pandemic primarily affected children and young and middle-aged adults, the impact of the (H1N1)pdm09 virus on the global population during the first year was less severe than that of previous pandemics. Estimates of pandemic influenza mortality ranged from 0.03 percent of the world\u2019s population during the 1968 H3N2 pandemic to 1 percent to 3 percent of the world\u2019s population during the 1918 H1N1 pandemic. It is estimated that 0.001 percent to 0.007 percent of the world\u2019s population died of respiratory complications associated with (H1N1)pdm09 virus infection during the first 12 months the virus circulated.\r<br>\r<br>The United States mounted a complex, multi-faceted and long-term response to the pandemic, summarized in The 2009 H1N1 Pandemic: Summary Highlights, April 2009-April 2010. On August 10, 2010, WHO declared an end to the global 2009 H1N1 influenza pandemic. However, (H1N1)pdm09 virus continues to circulate as a seasonal flu virus, and cause illness, hospitalization, and deaths worldwide every year.<br><br>This just a short list but I feel you get my drift.<br>Watch and see the next one will be the Mother of all Viruses<br>In short,  we&#39;re doomed,<br>Mother Earth will wipe us all out and it will be FAST, trust me on this one....<br>and re-start the world again.<br>We continue to kill mother earth,  so mother earth said, enough is enough.<br>I feel we all could change our future,  or, allow our destiny  to happen.<br><br>I say my farewell to you all now<br>Later may not be an option.", "comment_date": "2020-09-11T17:19:19Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Chi Chu", "comment_text": "Nukes missiles are laundering.The humans species are gone as the dinosaurs.", "comment_date": "2020-09-06T02:18:19Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Not Eren Yega", "comment_text": "Who else is here when the Indo-China Cold War is going on ??!", "comment_date": "2020-09-04T11:19:00Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "J Lupus", "comment_text": "Does this when an AK-47 won\u2019t be enough?", "comment_date": "2020-08-01T01:47:25Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "IcyboyG", "comment_text": "I have always imagined like a force field dome surrounding a city or a military installation that can stop anything from penetrating it.
