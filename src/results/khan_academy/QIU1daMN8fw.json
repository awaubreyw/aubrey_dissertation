For example, let&#39;s say we map from [x y] to [x y 0].  That should be invertible (right?), but since the codomain is R^3 and points like [1 2 3] aren&#39;t mapped to, it isn&#39;t surjective.

Making them blobs makes it more general.\nIf you learn Complex Analysis, you&#39;ll find that domains and codomains can have a shape to them. Actually, this is important for many of the theorems in Complex Analysis, and so a general &quot;blob&quot; shape is usually made to show that this works with any shaped set.", "comment_date": "2011-08-08T02:05:17Z", "likes_count": 2}}}, {"QIU1daMN8fw": {"Relating invertibility to being onto and one-to-one | Linear Algebra | Khan Academy": {"channel_id": "Ugz2JoSFVAnO-6FxQxh4AaABAg", "comment_by": "Fred Kelly", "comment_text": "Notice that a function is bijective exactly when it is both surjective and injective.", "comment_date": "2011-02-03T16:25:51Z", "likes_count": 2}}}]
