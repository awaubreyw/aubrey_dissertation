But no one remember it no one knew it because westerners tried to erase it but they failed . And created a make believe stupid holiday known as Christmas . We all humans are actually a part of Sanatan Dharma. Which means . Sanatan = From forever , Humanity , truth <br>Dharma = Life living laws or which westerners created a word called religions.  Religion is such a negative and poor word . Christianity Islamism Hinduism these are not religions, these are law&#39;s life living laws.  Christianity obay different life living laws Hindu&#39;s obey different . But actually we should obey one Life living law and that&#39;s Sanatan means Humanity.

This should be around 50,000 TO 75000 Years ago. There was no &#39;NEW gene flow in Indian subcontinent till 10000 years ago when ASI gene was formed by its intermingling with Middle eastern (Iranian) farmers.<br>3. Language development , particularly the written ones (Indo-european which also include Sanskrit) development usually considered to be coinciding with inflow of steppes pastoralists gene into Indian subcontinent, happened probably around 2500-1500 Years ago. Steppes pastoralists +ASI gene formed ANI gene.<br>4. Almost every Indian (and there form following Hinduism) has ASI gene in them to the least. Its the ANI proportion that changes in proportion when you move from southern to northern part of Indian subcontinent. <br>5. Per archaeology, Rakhigiri civilization is considered to be continuum of Harappa Civilization and it was believed to be based on vedic rituals (means Hinduism).  Religion doesn&#39;t form when people develop civilization rather its &#39;a belief that their parents have which they passed on to their kids&#39;. Even monkeys and animal may have their own religion till they make a collective effort to change it  somtoething different. Therefore Hinduism has to be presumed to be formed  when ASI gene formed to the least (that is around 10000 years ago) and may be prior to that when first homo settled its foot on Indian subcontinent with AASI gene formation (that is around 50000 to 75000 years ago).  Therefore Hinduism has to be originated between anywhere from 75000 years to 10000 years ago. Why?<br>AASI gene pool is also found in other parts of world (wherever out of Africa Hunters Gatherers migrated) but  there is no Hinduism there. Also ASI and ANI precursors (middle east, Iran, Iraq and Steppes region respectively) do not have Hinduism philosophy. Although culture there do show some &#39;trace of Hinduism text&#39; but not anywhere close to the what Hinduism is.<br>5. By current scientific consensus, in terms of &#39;authenticity&#39; following weight should be logically given: <br>Genetic&gt; Archaeology (will include carbon dating)&gt;Linguistic/literature. <br>Reason: Genetic analysis has least conflicting artifacts than other two. In this paragraph, I do not hesitate to comment that so called other dominant religion of today&#39;s world i.e. Christianity and Islam are not only influenced but rather originated by plagiarism of Hindu scripture. Per current facts, it should be assumed that due to this &#39;plagiarism&#39;, Hinduism gave rise to Jainism and Buddhism. Then Buddhism intermingled with Jewish religion to form Christianity. Then Middle easterner selfish clan developed Islam out of christian text and beliefs.<br>Hope it helps the nastiks. By the way being Nastik, you are still Hindu because Hinduism is not about believing god but rather &#39;doing chintan to find the ultimate truth, and Truth of our existence can be a god made out of matter or energy or rather combination of two&#39;.

It&#39;s a provisional model whose continued existence depends on its power of prediction and control, i.e., we stay alive, we don&#39;t die, it satisfies our needs, desires, will. It&#39;s a heuristic tool to get us what we want. It is not a mirror image of a free-standing reality. The little trout swimming in the fast-flowing mountain stream does not mirror the stream, but it lives in the stream and gets all it needs to stay alive from the stream, nutrients, oxygen, etc., if it acts within certain parameters. The little trout is viable in that environment like our conceptions of reality are viable in ours. It works. It survives. It&#39;s sustainable.

It is what it is and we are where we are and we take it from here, cherishing out heritage - biological, cultural, religious - and ready and willing to advance to a brave new future.

Imagine a hundred pearls on a string. Can each pearl claim the string that is within it as its own, that that part of the string belongs to that pearl? No, it cannot. Really, the pearl belongs to the string, and even though it can slide back and forth on the string, it just cannot claim the string as its own. So in the same way, Brahman flows through us. But the part of the Supreme Brahman within us, is not our &quot;Soul.&quot; It is the part of the Universe, Brahman, that our mind and body float on. If we believe in the five koshas or elements, there are : body layer, energy/praana/chi layer, then three layers of mind. It is my belief that when we die, the physical body is left behind to be burnt or decompose, but the remaining four layers are our &quot;soul.&quot; The soul, can remain indefinitely in the ether if it wants to, or incarnate again as per its inclination. But there is no penalty/punishment in the next birth or Janma to pay back or whatever, just more and more to learn. Until the soul feels, or is so guided by the most advanced souls, that it does not need another Janma; it then attains Moksha, or liberation.

The Hindus are all wrong though about Heaven being Evil ! The entire purpose of life is to go live in Heaven ! According to the scriptures of Hinduism the name of the single so called God of Hinduism is &quot;Brahm&quot; ! Of course in Hinduism it is taught that you have no eternal existence and that the Atman (Ones Soul) is not Immortal ! According to the scriptures of Hinduism ones Soul known as the Atman is obsorbed into &quot;Brahm&quot; and that their is no individuality and their is only the existence of &quot;Brahm&quot; left ! This is the idea of Monksha or Freedom in Hinduism ! Also according to the scriptures of Hinduism &quot;Brahm&quot; sits at the top of the Three Worlds (Heavens) and governs everything within these Three Worlds ( Heavens) which includes the Earth ! According to Hinduism the names of these Three Worlds (Heavens) are ... 1) The large Astral Heaven 2) The large Devachanic Heaven 3) The large Causal Heaven ! The large Causal Heaven has five small Heavens within it thus one plus one plus five is a total of seven Heavens ! These are the exact same seven Heavens that are recognized in Christianity ! Almost all religions in the world worship &quot;Brahm&quot; although by different names ! &quot;Brahm&quot; is an Introverted, Vain and Selfish so called God ! &quot;Brahm&quot; is the creator of all levels of Material Creation known as Lower Creation and as such &quot;Brahm&quot; is a Material so called God ! These seven Heavens of Lower Creation are Heavens of Psychism and the Mind ! The contents of these seven Heavens of Lower Creation may be that of Evil but fortunately their are many true Spiritual Heavens of Higher Creation that exist far, far above &quot;Brahm&quot; ! This is explained with in depth detail in an Ancient sacred scripture titled the SHARIYAT- KI- SUGMAD now available in the English language from the religion of ECKANKAR !

However, I might add the following for better understanding - <br>1. The word &quot;Hindu&quot; does not mean religion, it merely refers to the geographical connotation of the area beyond the Indus River. The actual &quot;religion&quot; in this case would be &quot;Sanathana Dharma&quot; which translates to the &quot;eternal way of life&quot;. It is merely an ideology to seek the inner truth about oneself and is far away from being a religion. There are no authoritative commandments, single god, authoritative body like a church, no prophet etc. <br>2. The discussion being made in the video relates to the Advaita philosophy propounded by Sri Adi Shankaracharya. This idea talks about the oneness between the Atman and Brahman. However, there are various other ideas like  Vishitadvaita and Dvaita which talk about Atman and Brahman being separate entities. So the idea spoken in the video is just one of many, however, it is the more widely accepted ideology.<br>3. The Aryan invasion theory has debunked and is not believed to be true.

Maybe this will give some insight for anyone who\u2019s curious about what experiential depths we can go to...<br><br>I can\u2019t say I was experiencing my nirvanic body/atman, but definitely one or two layers out from that, possibly my cosmic or causal body. I have more of a sense that it was my cosmic layer though. I was cognising, experiencing that I was wearing my body - my head felt like a helmet or sorts, with my eyes as a \u201cvisor\u201d. When others looked at my body I wouldn\u2019t think they were looking at me, I would think \u201cthis person is looking at my face\u201d, or something along lines, rather than \u201cthey\u2019re looking at me\u201d as a cognition. I was constantly soaked in this feeling that I was just a part of everything, that I was it. All fears and negative patterns just melted away, were non existent. I felt like I was embodying yoga by nature - every word was so precise and graceful. Every movement I made I was fully conscious of and I would love my body in a gentle manor - for instance, setting down a cup on the table would be with almost a respect or reverence for that cup, so I would place it very gently, rather than with that subtle violence we tend to emit towards inanimate objects. Also, everything just felt so effortless to do, no stress in my body or mind was involved in anything. My thoughts were virtually zero to only 4 thoughts a minute at most, instead of the usual 4/5 thoughts every few seconds (like how we tend to string thoughts together and miss the space between them). I remember even my breathing was so deep it felt like my breath was travelling past my lungs and down into the ground, but also it was going up through my head and beyond at the same. My lungs just felt so big! I didn\u2019t really have this concept of \u201cI\u201d but I knew who I was still, but I mostly just felt like I was my Guru - as if I was in his body/having his experience, in some way. I say this because this was when I felt the most connected to him and really felt his pervasiveness in my being.<br>This is the best way I can describe the whole experience, but I feel it\u2019s like trying to explain colour to a blind person. The way I can shorten it down is, everything which was once just a concept, something I knew was the truth and so spoke as the truth, formed a logic around and could only visualise at most, suddenly was just a living reality beyond any comprehension of visualisation. I learned that no matter how much we speak about and act as if we know about these deep spiritual truths, we never truly know until we experience it!<br><br>Actually I have to add one thing about Karma, because it\u2019s so widely misconceived and is quite vague and confusing to most seekers in Dharmic paths because it isn\u2019t explained very simply. Karma can be seen as a consequence of our actions, but actually if we go deeper, it\u2019s our cognitions that are our karma because our cognitions dictate our impulse action. It\u2019s our cognitions about ourselves, others and life that controls the impulsive actions we take. Impulsive actions are what we call as a karma, because they are unconscious actions that we act out as a pattern (often without even knowing it)  - this is what is Karma. So for people who are worried about karma, instead of trying to change your actions which will can be like just putting a bandage on a wound, just work on changing your actual cognitions - work on the root of your actions and heal them from that space. This is all that is karma.

I am the Lord who dwells in every creature. <br>Through the power of my own maya, I manifest myself in a <br>finite form.<br>7.1Earth, water, fire, air, akasha, mind, intellect, and ego \u2013 these are the eight divisions of my prakriti. <br>7.2But beyond this I have another, higher nature; it supports the whole universe and is the source of life in all human beings.<br>7.3In these two aspects of my nature is the womb of all creation. The birth and dissolution of the cosmos itself take place in me. <br>7.4There is nothing that exists separate from me. The entire universe is suspended from me as a necklace of jewels.<br>7.5I am the taste of pure water and the radiance of the sun and moon. I am the sacred word and the sound heard in air, and the courage of human beings.<br>7.6I am the sweet fragrance in the earth and the radiance of fire; I am the life in every creature and the striving of the spiritual aspirant.<br>7.7My eternal seed is to be found in every creature. I am the power of discrimination in those who are intelligent, and the glory of the noble.<br>7.8In those who are strong, I am strength, free from passion and selfish attachment. I am desire itself, if that desire is in harmony with the purpose of life.<br>8.1 My highest nature, the imperishable Brahman, gives every creature its existence and lives in every creature as adhyatama. My action is creation and the bringing forth of creatures.<br>8.2The adhibhuta is the perishable body; the adhidaiva is the Purusha, eternal spirit. The adhiyajna, the supreme sacrifice, is made to me as the Lord within you.<br>8.3The Lord is the supreme poet, the first cause, the sovereign ruler, subtler than the tiniest particle, the support of all, inconceivable, bright as the sun, beyond darkness.<br>8.4But beyond this formless state there is another, unmanifested reality, which is eternal and not dissolved when the cosmos is destroyed.<br>8.5Those who realize life\u2019s supreme goal know that I am unmanifest and unchanging. Having come home to me, they never return to separate existence.<br>8.6This supreme Lord who pervades all existence, the true Self of all creatures, may be realized through undivided love.<br>9.1I pervade the entire universe in my unmanifested form. All creatures find their existence in me, but I am not limited by them.<br>9.2I am the father and mother of this universe, and its grandfather too; I am its entire support. <br>9.3I am the goal of life, the Lord and support of all, the inner witness, the abode of all. I am the only refuge, the one true friend; I am the beginning, the staying, and the end of creation; I am the womb and the eternal seed.<br>9.4I am heat; I give and withhold the rain. I am immortality and I am death; I am what is and what is not.<br>10.1Whoever knows me as the Lord of all creation, without birth or beginning, knows the truth and frees himself from all evil.<br>10.2I am the seed that can be found in every creature; for without me nothing can exist, neither animate nor inanimate.<br>13.1The body is called a field; the one who knows it is called the knower of the field. This is the knowledge of those who know.<br>13.2I am the Knower of the field in everyone. Knowledge of the field and its Knower is true knowledge.<br>13.3This supreme Self is without a beginning, undifferentiated, deathless. Though it dwells in the body, it neither acts nor is touched by action. <br>13.4As akasha pervades the cosmos but remains unstained, the Self can never be tainted though it dwells in every creature.<br>13.5As the sun lights up the world, the Self dwelling in the field is the source of all light in the field. <br>13.6Those who, with the eye of wisdom, distinguish the field from its Knower and the way to freedom from the bondage of prakriti, attain the supreme goal.<br>15.1In this world there are two orders of being: the perishable, separate creature and the changeless spirit.<br>15.2But beyond these there is another, the supreme Self, the eternal Lord, who enters into the entire cosmos and supports it from within.<br>15.3I am that Supreme Self, praised by the scriptures as beyond the changing and the changeless.<br>15.4Those who see in me that supreme Self see truly.
