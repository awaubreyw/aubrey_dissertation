I never knew I was Israelite, but I guess I should have known because I was always curious about the bible stories and always felt part of the people of the bible. Now I have proof. I have also 22% Chongoni Rock art , which fits with my ancestry because I am a quarter black. Just a warning, don\u2019t get the beginner test, it\u2019s cheaper but it doesn\u2019t have the ancient people of the Bible.", "comment_date": "2021-05-22T01:47:39Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "DylanOriginal", "comment_text": "nooooo profe porqueeee?\u00a1\u00a1", "comment_date": "2021-04-14T13:46:35Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "drtn", "comment_text": "Mostly myth though, not a lot of historical value..", "comment_date": "2021-03-29T13:00:27Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "tchoopee514", "comment_text": "Wait so the same guy that was teaching me about implicit differentiation and log properties knows Bible history too?
