When I lecture to high schoolers about Islam, I invite them to consider what factors enabled the Reformation, and have them think about whether Gutenberg&#39;s printing press would have been as valuable (when it came to printing the Bible and disseminating it to the non-clerical, non-noble classes) if Islam hadn&#39;t united so much of the world and brought to Europe cheap paper and ink from China. When you compare Jesus and Constantine with Muhammad, the situation is a little different. Constantine united Christian clerics and scholars in an attempt to get them to sort out what exactly Christians believe (the first of multiple conclaves, and the unfortunate result of a lot was the excommunication or outright violence against whoever believed something other than these councils decided (like lots of Arians died as a result of Trinitarian theology). Muhammad dictated the Qur&#39;an within his own lifetime and it was collected and organized only a few years later under Umar (2nd Caliph). So Muslims started out knowing universally what they believed and with an excellent pattern for the structure of society. Not a practicing Muslim, although I can make the Shahada without lying.
