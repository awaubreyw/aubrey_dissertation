Over the course of time, It became more suitable for ordinary people instead of practicing actual cultivation to reach enlightenment. Mahayana was widely spread across other countries like China, Japan and South east Asia. Theravada was an orthodox cultivation practice and not a religion.

After this some drivers used to steal their brought head and take the gold mud by showing the king again.
