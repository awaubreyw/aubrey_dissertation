The engineering of machines requires left-brain geometry, axioms and logic.  <br>However, when students or adults wish to go beyond mere logic as a tool for addressing life&#39;s challenges, we begin seeing how limited left-brain-only geometry is.  <br>Callum Coats, a student of Viktor Schauberger, brought the paucity of left-brain-only geometry home to me.  <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pEwi1NqvGOs\">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pEwi1NqvGOs</a> <br>If we look everywhere in Nature, we see forms, volumes and above it all the radiance of the Sun.  However the Euclidian geometry of man&#39;s inventions since 1750, limited to points, lines, circles, ovals and axioms can NOT reproduce nor produce much insight to the organic forms of Nature.  Natural organic forms rarely use points, lines, circles, ovals and axioms.  <br>What do they use?  Well, we are still learning about this.  One starting place is the polarity of expansion~contraction is a primarily a linear concept, the line expands or contracts.  <br>Even if we demonstrate expansion~contraction with circles-ovals, we are still in only two dimensions.  When we start expanding and contracting in three dimensions, we come closer to Nature&#39;s geometry; yet, we quickly perceive volumes per se are only a partial geometry of Nature.  <br>Schauberger, thru Callum Coats, helped me see the missing geometry contrasting with volumes is radiance, as in the Sun.  A beginning of a Geometry of Nature can start with the polarity of Radiance and Suction.
