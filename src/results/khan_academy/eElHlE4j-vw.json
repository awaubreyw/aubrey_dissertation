[{"comment_by": "Mye Flatley", "comment_text": "I agree.  With time, more and more of the money supply is constantly shifting into the hands of the richest.  This then creates a tighter and tighter money supply amongst the middle class and the poor.  This tightening of the money supply then results in recession and then a depression.  Without the money supply being rebalanced thru inheritance taxing, the economy comes to a halt as it did in the 1930&#39;s.  Right now the government borrows money from the richest to keep the economy going.  An inheritance tax is a much more practical way to rebalance the money supply.  Without such a tax the government will go further into debt and eventually bankrupt.  That would be catastrophic for the global economy.", "comment_date": "2021-01-04T04:22:23Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "allsparkwars2", "comment_text": "35 percent is too high, but it is reasonable to have some tax on something after 10 Million dollars.", "comment_date": "2020-07-31T17:32:50Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Sam Steers", "comment_text": "It&#39;s a policy failure that there are no individual trillionaire&#39;s", "comment_date": "2020-04-28T10:02:36Z", "likes_count": 2}, {"comment_by": "Sam Steers", "comment_text": "Such a socialist way of thinking how wealth is produced", "comment_date": "2020-04-28T09:48:17Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Sam Steers", "comment_text": "Taxation is theft", "comment_date": "2020-04-28T09:46:21Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "REF KRIS", "comment_text": "Estate Tax is just taxation of money that has already been taxed.", "comment_date": "2018-12-15T21:56:15Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Justin", "comment_text": "So that&#39;s why Billionaires &quot;give away&quot; all their money.
