If it is me, the implication is that if B chooses to exercise this option at strike price, I still need to buy the stock from the market and sell it to B, so before I end up doing something like this, I wanna understand what it means.", "comment_date": "2019-05-10T19:22:14Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Adrien Tardif", "comment_text": "In the ends, who issue the options that can be traded ?", "comment_date": "2017-09-13T20:46:13Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "F\u00e1t", "comment_text": "Hi Khan,  Thank you for your great video tutorial.
