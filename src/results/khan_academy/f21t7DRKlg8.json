They were merely subtle semantic mismatches between plural pronouns and technically singular antecedents (which are usually conceptually plural, like &quot;anyone&quot; or &quot;everone&quot;).   By analogy, one can imagine a person saying: &quot;When one of us next goes to the post office, we should pick up the package waiting there.&quot;   I have no strong aversion to such semantic mismatches, but it is bizarre that you mock the 19th century gramarians for being averse to them, while at the same time relying on the rule they created requiring a match, to prove that the mismatched plural pronoun is really singular after all (because otherwise it would not match).  Also, I don&#39;t see what you are trying to prove with the discussion of &quot;thou&quot; and &quot;you&quot;, and other lost forms.  We have lost many pronoun distinctions, and pronoun forms, and pronouns, but I don&#39;t see how it follows that we should lose another one.", "comment_date": "2022-05-17T23:28:23Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Fraiseyyes", "comment_text": "Thank you!
