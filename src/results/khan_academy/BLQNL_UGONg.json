I bet if you learned math this way you would hate it. <br>Thanks for your website-- but please, focus on people instead of concepts.", "comment_date": "2021-10-18T21:18:26Z", "likes_count": 2}}}, {"BLQNL_UGONg": {"Showing relationship between cosine and sine of complements | Trigonometry | Khan Academy": {"channel_id": "UgwJg-HdWrTSeO5polJ4AaABAg", "comment_by": "8D Copyright Free Music", "comment_text": "ee dud", "comment_date": "2021-07-13T02:09:56Z", "likes_count": 0}}}, {"BLQNL_UGONg": {"Showing relationship between cosine and sine of complements | Trigonometry | Khan Academy": {"channel_id": "UgwSFLsebvfqJLzCoZ94AaABAg", "comment_by": "Mr. Banana Man", "comment_text": "<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLQNL_UGONg&amp;t=0m00s\">0:00</a> nice voice crack :P", "comment_date": "2021-03-16T23:08:09Z", "likes_count": 2}}}, {"BLQNL_UGONg": {"Showing relationship between cosine and sine of complements | Trigonometry | Khan Academy": {"channel_id": "Ugws22IT_hhgjgP2_xh4AaABAg", "comment_by": "Dabi Clips", "comment_text": "This dud sounds like Joe from family guy", "comment_date": "2021-02-11T04:51:34Z", "likes_count": 0}}}, {"BLQNL_UGONg": {"Showing relationship between cosine and sine of complements | Trigonometry | Khan Academy": {"channel_id": "UgyiAv-FJXnFGtTAOKl4AaABAg", "comment_by": "ahmed mohamed", "comment_text": "very good", "comment_date": "2020-02-12T20:35:21Z", "likes_count": 0}}}, {"BLQNL_UGONg": {"Showing relationship between cosine and sine of complements | Trigonometry | Khan Academy": {"channel_id": "UgzZTdrFVRIcWS_2eDN4AaABAg", "comment_by": "Vojtech Ryb\u00e1r", "comment_text": "thank u, next", "comment_date": "2019-12-06T21:07:11Z", "likes_count": 1}}}, {"BLQNL_UGONg": {"Showing relationship between cosine and sine of complements | Trigonometry | Khan Academy": {"channel_id": "Ugx518ErIQfWe_thxRJ4AaABAg", "comment_by": "Vader", "comment_text": "We SEEEE :D Nice one, Khan :P", "comment_date": "2019-09-23T19:32:01Z", "likes_count": 5}}}, {"BLQNL_UGONg": {"Showing relationship between cosine and sine of complements | Trigonometry | Khan Academy": {"channel_id": "Ugy07IdmqmFE-_AfqaF4AaABAg", "comment_by": "CookieJar", "comment_text": "Lol imagine if you&#39;re at kinder and you watch this haha", "comment_date": "2019-05-18T07:47:10Z", "likes_count": 2}}}, {"BLQNL_UGONg": {"Showing relationship between cosine and sine of complements | Trigonometry | Khan Academy": {"channel_id": "UgzGZvSsfTs0T_KfjLZ4AaABAg", "comment_by": "Nice to mole you", "comment_text": "wut", "comment_date": "2019-02-21T23:18:22Z", "likes_count": 2}}}, {"BLQNL_UGONg": {"Showing relationship between cosine and sine of complements | Trigonometry | Khan Academy": {"channel_id": "UgweIf2GRPhQkNtelvF4AaABAg", "comment_by": "HappinessYata", "comment_text": "Thx a lot!", "comment_date": "2018-11-08T06:38:19Z", "likes_count": 1}}}, {"BLQNL_UGONg": {"Showing relationship between cosine and sine of complements | Trigonometry | Khan Academy": {"channel_id": "UgzqPF7nzS9HM9Jqy8B4AaABAg", "comment_by": "Master Maxx", "comment_text": "this video is so umderrated", "comment_date": "2018-10-05T17:26:47Z", "likes_count": 0}}}, {"BLQNL_UGONg": {"Showing relationship between cosine and sine of complements | Trigonometry | Khan Academy": {"channel_id": "Ughb4cMKCPlzIngCoAEC", "comment_by": "\u7f85\u6069\u5149Aacon Loh", "comment_text": "Perfect Maths teacher.", "comment_date": "2015-04-07T13:22:07Z", "likes_count": 5}}}, {"BLQNL_UGONg": {"Showing relationship between cosine and sine of complements | Trigonometry | Khan Academy": {"channel_id": "UgjJcBpigPnfsXgCoAEC", "comment_by": "ProfessorPeasant", "comment_text": "You are wayyyyyy too underrated!", "comment_date": "2013-12-15T19:20:54Z", "likes_count": 9}}}, {"BLQNL_UGONg": {"Showing relationship between cosine and sine of complements | Trigonometry | Khan Academy": {"channel_id": "UgjSQwC7IdB_sXgCoAEC", "comment_by": "Stone Hobson", "comment_text": "These are great for going over the basics I&#39;ve forgotten.<br>Nice\u00a0presentation.
