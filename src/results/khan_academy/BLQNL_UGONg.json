[{"comment_by": "Cloud Galaxy", "comment_text": "As I get older, I think the French math style like this is the reason why most people hate math. You just tell someone a truth and it knocks the wind out of their sails. <br>It&#39;s the same thing as telling the punchline before a joke. <br><br>I hope this criticism actually gets to you-- because this style may work for those with very robotic minds, and for refreshing people on concepts, but this is a terrible way to actually learn something new. I bet if you learned math this way you would hate it. <br>Thanks for your website-- but please, focus on people instead of concepts.", "comment_date": "2021-10-18T21:18:26Z", "likes_count": 2}, {"comment_by": "8D Copyright Free Music", "comment_text": "ee dud", "comment_date": "2021-07-13T02:09:56Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Mr. Banana Man", "comment_text": "<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLQNL_UGONg&amp;t=0m00s\">0:00</a> nice voice crack :P", "comment_date": "2021-03-16T23:08:09Z", "likes_count": 2}, {"comment_by": "Dabi Clips", "comment_text": "This dud sounds like Joe from family guy", "comment_date": "2021-02-11T04:51:34Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "ahmed mohamed", "comment_text": "very good", "comment_date": "2020-02-12T20:35:21Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Vojtech Ryb\u00e1r", "comment_text": "thank u, next", "comment_date": "2019-12-06T21:07:11Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Vader", "comment_text": "We SEEEE :D Nice one, Khan :P", "comment_date": "2019-09-23T19:32:01Z", "likes_count": 5}, {"comment_by": "CookieJar", "comment_text": "Lol imagine if you&#39;re at kinder and you watch this haha", "comment_date": "2019-05-18T07:47:10Z", "likes_count": 2}, {"comment_by": "Nice to mole you", "comment_text": "wut", "comment_date": "2019-02-21T23:18:22Z", "likes_count": 2}, {"comment_by": "HappinessYata", "comment_text": "Thx a lot!", "comment_date": "2018-11-08T06:38:19Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Master Maxx", "comment_text": "this video is so umderrated", "comment_date": "2018-10-05T17:26:47Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "\u7f85\u6069\u5149Aacon Loh", "comment_text": "Perfect Maths teacher.", "comment_date": "2015-04-07T13:22:07Z", "likes_count": 5}, {"comment_by": "ProfessorPeasant", "comment_text": "You are wayyyyyy too underrated!", "comment_date": "2013-12-15T19:20:54Z", "likes_count": 9}, {"comment_by": "Stone Hobson", "comment_text": "These are great for going over the basics I&#39;ve forgotten.<br>Nice\u00a0presentation.
