But if you assume equal dimensions (like &#39;square&#39; matrices), it could be helpful to know they are distributive as well, I suppose..", "comment_date": "2012-02-02T12:16:24Z", "likes_count": 11}, {"comment_by": "alkalait", "comment_text": "i can see how this can be a boring, maybe trivial, but necessary part of a solid grounding to more complex formulations of linear algebra", "comment_date": "2010-01-29T04:07:29Z", "likes_count": 3}]
