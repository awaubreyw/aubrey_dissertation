So 2(-5)-(-1), Long story short the answer I got was incorrect because I should of turned the negative 1 into a positive: (10)+(+1) and added the last 2 numbers, because I was told that sometimes minus a negative can equal a positive. But then in the second test question it was: X= -2, Y=8, Z= -5. So 3(-5)-(-2). I ended up doing (-5) +(+ 2). <b>WHICH WAS INCORRECT</b> Even though I thought i was suppose to turn minus a negative into a freaking positive! :(", "comment_date": "2019-10-14T09:34:42Z", "likes_count": 0}}}, {"JnpqlXN9Whw": {"Negative exponents | Exponents, radicals, and scientific notation | Pre-Algebra | Khan Academy": {"channel_id": "Ugyvl_EWxg_BEp36KMN4AaABAg", "comment_by": "existential crisis", "comment_text": "I\u2019m confused as to why the negative sign becomes 1/ can somebody explain this to me?", "comment_date": "2019-10-03T01:23:55Z", "likes_count": 1}}}, {"JnpqlXN9Whw": {"Negative exponents | Exponents, radicals, and scientific notation | Pre-Algebra | Khan Academy": {"channel_id": "UgyrwMK5lA9gb2Fp6Yh4AaABAg", "comment_by": "Biba Idrissa", "comment_text": "Thanks, my math teacher  can&#39;t teach for nothing.", "comment_date": "2019-10-02T21:11:55Z", "likes_count": 32}}}, {"JnpqlXN9Whw": {"Negative exponents | Exponents, radicals, and scientific notation | Pre-Algebra | Khan Academy": {"channel_id": "Ugw58TkKA4nKLdv5SuJ4AaABAg", "comment_by": "Emma", "comment_text": "math makes me cry regularly", "comment_date": "2019-09-05T02:16:39Z", "likes_count": 10}}}, {"JnpqlXN9Whw": {"Negative exponents | Exponents, radicals, and scientific notation | Pre-Algebra | Khan Academy": {"channel_id": "UgxVnIXdbk18Oogr06Z4AaABAg", "comment_by": "Smdb", "comment_text": "8th grade maths is hard thanks dude", "comment_date": "2019-09-04T20:05:14Z", "likes_count": 1}}}, {"JnpqlXN9Whw": {"Negative exponents | Exponents, radicals, and scientific notation | Pre-Algebra | Khan Academy": {"channel_id": "Ugy9dRICVTiZEaG-8jN4AaABAg", "comment_by": "Ben", "comment_text": "epic vid much pain", "comment_date": "2019-09-03T08:58:00Z", "likes_count": 2}}}, {"JnpqlXN9Whw": {"Negative exponents | Exponents, radicals, and scientific notation | Pre-Algebra | Khan Academy": {"channel_id": "UgzgEbZjYaaCIfcczOV4AaABAg", "comment_by": "Adventures With Matt", "comment_text": "Please do not use Magenta, it is hard to read.", "comment_date": "2019-08-29T22:17:44Z", "likes_count": 2}}}, {"JnpqlXN9Whw": {"Negative exponents | Exponents, radicals, and scientific notation | Pre-Algebra | Khan Academy": {"channel_id": "UgyTawY7yCmzOxHMaoB4AaABAg", "comment_by": "Kenneth Zartman", "comment_text": "Thanks just reteaching myself since being out of school way longer than I went and never thought or was taught to put the one in front making it easier to remember for the negative exponents", "comment_date": "2019-08-15T22:40:59Z", "likes_count": 3}}}, {"JnpqlXN9Whw": {"Negative exponents | Exponents, radicals, and scientific notation | Pre-Algebra | Khan Academy": {"channel_id": "UgzZxRCoyakkoA-Vp_h4AaABAg", "comment_by": "BeBeingBenMesa", "comment_text": "\u201cLet\u2019s do one more example, just in an attempt to confuse ourseves\u201d~ &quot;It was time for Thomas to leave, he had seen everything&quot;....", "comment_date": "2019-06-22T14:45:10Z", "likes_count": 18}}}, {"JnpqlXN9Whw": {"Negative exponents | Exponents, radicals, and scientific notation | Pre-Algebra | Khan Academy": {"channel_id": "UgygjQvQcLL95NY-ebV4AaABAg", "comment_by": "Shay", "comment_text": "Yeah thanks..i got it", "comment_date": "2019-06-02T03:23:48Z", "likes_count": 0}}}, {"JnpqlXN9Whw": {"Negative exponents | Exponents, radicals, and scientific notation | Pre-Algebra | Khan Academy": {"channel_id": "UgziDu8aFve60ML1IQR4AaABAg", "comment_by": "charredskeleton", "comment_text": "<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JnpqlXN9Whw&amp;t=6m33s\">6:33</a> on jives with me .
