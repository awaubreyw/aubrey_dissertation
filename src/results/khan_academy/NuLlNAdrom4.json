Every time the federal government spends, it creates new dollars to fund that spending. That is how dollars are created and injected into the private sector. Federal taxes are how dollars are extracted from the private sector and destroyed. Federal taxes are not recycled. In fact, if you pay your taxes in cash, they literally shred it. In the olden days, back when all taxes were paid in cash, they burned it. This belief that taxes are recycled is a neoliberal bluff akin to believing that banks are financial intermediaries that take deposits and then lend those out. This is a strange faith in what was learned from George Bailey in It&#39;s a Wonderful Life. The financial intermediary theory of banking, like the fractional reserve theory of banking are complete bunk. There is no empirical evidence to support either of these theories. The only theory of banking that is empirically proven is the credit creation theory of banking. Imagine for a moment that the federal government asks you to pay a tax in dollars before it, the sole creator of the dollar, has spent it into existence. Is it possible? No. The federal government has to create that dollar before it can tax that dollar. And no, the federal government never borrows dollars to fund spending. Securities are a monetary tool used to control the overnight interest rate and a timed payout savings account. It is also not a funding mechanism. As for state taxes, yes, the state absolutely needs revenue before it can spend that revenue as it is not a currency creator. It&#39;s like comparing apples to a soccer ball.", "comment_date": "2022-01-21T07:03:03Z", "likes_count": 0}}}, {"NuLlNAdrom4": {"Taxation and dead weight loss | Microeconomics | Khan Academy": {"channel_id": "Ugx-1oxzFC45ySfnMXN4AaABAg", "comment_by": "RobTheViking", "comment_text": "Just throwing this out there:   demand is impossible to quantify.
