A problem which I have faced is that the data I am trying to use belong to a non-normal distribution showing heavy kurtosis. I am often carried away with the correct terminology but would you be able to suggest what is the correct method for comparing two means for trading rules for two different strategies considering the non-normal distribution of stock returns. The main critique I face using this method is that this holds true for normal distribution.
