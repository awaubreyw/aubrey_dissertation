Money is power and the more money you have the more the chances that you can get even more money. This is at the heart of consolidation that has been happening in the world economy in the past thirty years where big companies are getting bigger and bigger and because that means more power they don&#39;t let any competition to form, either buying and dissolving the competition at an early stage or drowning it out in public sphere through advertisement or outright not letting it operate (a la Amazon, threatening publishers who sell their books on other platforms). Everywhere you look in market economies, you see more and more consolidation of industries and monopolies forming instead of competition. And these monopolies in many cases are stronger than many governments and they are inherently authoritarian structures since there&#39;s no democratic representation a la a parliament or democratically elected president or executive branch or an independent judiciary. Because of these consolidations, the capitalist class, CEOs, CFOs, etc. are increasing their share of the profits as can be seen in increases in upper managerial class incomes as opposed to the rate of increase in workers income. Most economies in the world before 1980s were despite what they claimed closer to command economies. Corporations could not get as big as they get now because of anti-trust laws, governments had the power to break them up. Governments were very powerful in dealing with corporations but starting from 1980s the Chicago school, as described here as &quot;capitalism&quot;, took over and limited the power of governments, giving more freedoms to corporations and advertising this as a democratic move, but governments ideally at least to a certain extent represent people, while corporations represent special interests, so taking power away from governments and giving them to corporations may be advertised as giving freedom to people but what it actually amounts to is taking power from people at large and giving it to the capitalist class, a group which doesn&#39;t need to answer to anyone in a democratic way. This development which is sometimes called market fundamentalism has caused huge instability in world economy, in which recessions have doubled in speed, leaving millions in dire conditions every decade in a accelerating cycle, while enriching very few; and in terms of management of resources this system also has been proven to have an abysmal track record, for instance in terms of food, the amount of food produced in the world is enough to feed the whole population of the earth three times over but billions are grappling with starvation. In communist economies when countries faced famine and starvation, the command economy was blamed for it and deaths caused from it. This is easy to do since the command economy claims to be centrally planning the economy so for the layperson it is easy to justify seeing the command economy as the cause of the things that&#39;s happening in an economy, be it famine and starvation or on the other hand success in feeding people. But when it comes to market economies, although they principally claim it to be a better way of managing the economy, through a sleight of hand, the negative consequences of the system are shifted always elsewhere because they claim that no one is planning this, so a starvation in market economies is always blamed on some other factor but all the successes are claimed as the result of market economy. But a market economy is a way of managing resources, so if the management of resources is failing as badly as it is doing now in our global market economy, the blame is on the &quot;unplanned&quot; short-term myopic outlook of market economies. Since the advent of Chicago school, and increase in market fundamentalism, aka freer enterprise, in 1980s, the resulting world is a world in which for the first time since the industrial revolution (successes of which market economists attribute to free market, while no free market existed in England or Netherlands until late 19th century and advent of science has nothing to do with the form of government as been proven in history time and time again), the new generation is faring worse than their parents. To claim religiously as market economists do, who are mostly themselves tied to the financial sector or whose faculties are funded by libertarian billionaires, that competition is always good and that letting the markets be without any long-term planning is the way to go, is what got us into this mess with climate change and horrible allocation of resources. What hopefully distinguishes humans from other animals is rationality and the hallmark of rationality is a thorough analysis of past and present and using this to devise a long-term plan taking into account data and insight gathered from many different areas of knowledge and science. This cooperation and long-term planning is the essence of rationality and market economy is telling us that this is not the way to go and in fact the opposite is better. Yes the opposite is better for the billionaires and the economists that get a consulting gig to push this nonsense but it&#39;s not better for our planet and its population.", "comment_date": "2022-07-07T13:21:25Z", "likes_count": 1}}}, {"Ve6K10-Yx_M": {"Command and market economies | Basic economics concepts | AP Macroeconomics | Khan Academy": {"channel_id": "Ugwf71asyNT3u27zEaR4AaABAg", "comment_by": "Ugust Parre Angel", "comment_text": "Command economy = government dictates allocations of scarce resssources\r<br>*less product variety\r<br>*removes competition, no motivation to meet market\r<br>*no incentives to innovate\r<br>*no job competition\r<br>*capital equality\r<br>*social safety\r<br>\r<br>Market economy = market dictates allocations of scarce ressources\r<br>*more product variety\r<br>*creates competition, motivation to meet market\r<br>*incentives to innovate\r<br>*job competition\r<br>*capital inequality\r<br>*less social safety", "comment_date": "2022-05-27T18:16:15Z", "likes_count": 3}}}, {"Ve6K10-Yx_M": {"Command and market economies | Basic economics concepts | AP Macroeconomics | Khan Academy": {"channel_id": "UgwEv9nEsCxQcAM2LPh4AaABAg", "comment_by": "Tony stark", "comment_text": "I love you.", "comment_date": "2022-02-07T18:14:31Z", "likes_count": 0}}}, {"Ve6K10-Yx_M": {"Command and market economies | Basic economics concepts | AP Macroeconomics | Khan Academy": {"channel_id": "UgzkFDE9b_zzTgNp8Nh4AaABAg", "comment_by": "Ananth S", "comment_text": "Oprah winfrey moment @<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ve6K10-Yx_M&amp;t=1m53s\">1:53</a>", "comment_date": "2022-01-23T13:36:49Z", "likes_count": 1}}}, {"Ve6K10-Yx_M": {"Command and market economies | Basic economics concepts | AP Macroeconomics | Khan Academy": {"channel_id": "UgyrfGhH_NafyFP8NXF4AaABAg", "comment_by": "Shk Mudasir", "comment_text": "Thnk yu...<br>It was very intresting.

There was innovation included, as every so often the engineering team suggested a new version of a product.

Imagine a profile page with it&#39;s own style, when you get in a car you could have it looking like your own personal style. But even then a car isn&#39;t really about making a statement, it&#39;s about getting from a to b. But the point of styling is to keep the world interesting. Never a dull moment. We should be working on technology that can be the style a person wants on demand. This would not affect the hardware or software. Imagine lego blocks with motors, on a tiny scale. That can be formed in a pattern we like. The style we choose would be up to us. Now with vehicles it could just be the windows styles and so on.

The rest of the time 3d printers and methods would be available in which everyone could have any design they wanted, and then select how it is to look or even hoe stringy and soft something is. This could be done with layering. Like how fabric is woven. But point being the aim would be to allow everyone to have something by creating a device which could re-make the part made.

And since the government is the people, they would always look out for all peoples interest, not tainted by profit or gain, but looking to give what everyone needed. That is if the government is actually run by the people. It would be better though if you had local statisticians working out what is needed and what people want in that area, and working out if it can be done. This would all be about the best interest of the people. It would not be about setting up those in government with power as I said the government should be run by all people.
