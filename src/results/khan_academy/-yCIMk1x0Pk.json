Thus far no offspring that I know of in any papers or literature have been carried full terms to a viable clone. Many times the females body rejects the embryo and this will almost always happen if its not that very females own somatic stem cells that are regressed. Sometimes its the cell membrane that simply refuses to host the stem cells.<br><br>The uses of this are to generate lots and lots of embryonic stem cells which would be used in turn to offer gene therapy to patients with diseases where an individualized solution is required. A good example might be congenital heart defects. iPS cells are often times not good enough for this due to lack of plasticity.<br><br>I&#39;m not sure what ethical considerations there are about this. Obviously if this was a human and the mother carried the fetus to term then the offspring would be her clone and would also therefore have no father, just a mother. There were of course also issues around telemeres at the ends of genes which seem to keep their original length from the somatic cell donar and therefore the offspring ages much faster than its donar. I think those have been solved, I dunno I&#39;m nota biologist and I just tend to read a lot.<br><br>But one things for sure, we can&#39;t just listen to every tom, dick or harry with any ethical concerns which are based on things other than medical ethics. That&#39;d be like giving a platform to a taxi driver on whether its a good idea to build spacecraft... Medical ethics is the concern of all of us but such ethics should be formed based on an &#39;informed&#39; opinion of the procedure being discussed and not on anything else. Otherwise &#39;I just don&#39;t like it&#39; becomes in and of itself an ethical concern.<br><br>What I don&#39;t get is that when concerns of an embryonic stem cell lines are pointed out then that line may be destroyed, or a court might order it to be destroyed, usually by incineration. Thats done usually becasue the donar is already pregnant with a child and the cells canot be used a second time anyway since they can&#39;t be frozen successfully.  Now I&#39;m not sure if &#39;incineration&#39; is a viable way to allow a blastocyst to progress to an actual child... I&#39;ve never heard of that working. So what objectors to this technology actually want is for a cell they see as being a child to be destroyed.... which I think is a little weird to say the least! Its a little like arguing that children are potential adults (which is true) and that a child life is sacrosanct (also true) and that the solution to children who are born severely mentally or physically disabled, too disabled to mature into an adult mentally, or they won&#39;t last until then.... would be to pop them all into the oven at birth....
