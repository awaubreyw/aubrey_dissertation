It&#39;s also true this part of world is small with lot of confusing problems for which the rest of the world doesn&#39;t have time nor understanding. International public remembers Yugoslavia much more than it remembers states that preceded the empires before Yugoslavia. The problem of this part of world is not just linguistics and religion. It is also about states. All the states that you can see now on the map of Balkans have been existing in medieval time before Ottoman Empire and Habsburg Monarchy, except Kosovo (but in that case there is another problem of territories occupied by Albanian people before Yugoslav boundaries). <br>With late arrival of national ideas, identities that were previously based on religion transformed into identities based on ethnicity and statehood (and religion) and became a fuel to hatred, from Balkan Wars to the breakup of Yugoslavia. Very few historians mention that Muslim population of Balkans was almost totally swept away during First and Second Balkan War and WW1. <br>The term &quot;Serbo-Croatian language&quot; is widely used in international linguistics but it doesn&#39;t have foothold in ex-Yu countries. Even Serbs, to whom Yugoslavia was most useful for achieving their national and political goals - don&#39;t use this term. Applying one name for language inside societies of these countries is impossible, contrary to what it is a case about English. Croats, Bosniaks and Montenegrins see this name as a remnant of Serb-dominated state they haven&#39;t been satisfied about.<br>When it is about Bosnia, things become even more complicated. Bosnia is a country with 1000 years of history. It had bans, but also kings. It&#39;s was multi religious society all the time. During Ottomans Muslim population inside the empire was enlisted. Christian population wasn&#39;t enlisted, but was obliged to pay taxes. In the last days of empire the wars have been numeorus and exhausting. Bosniaks lost a lot of their men. Days before arrival of Austro-Hungarian Empire Muslim population of Bosnia was just 50 000 bigger than Christian population. After this 200 000 Bosniaks left to Ottoman Empire and Orthodox Christians (who started to call themselves Serbs 1 or 2 decades before that) became the majority (by 150 000). That is when Bosnian problems begun.<br>The reason why we are calling ourselves Bosnians and Bosniaks is that Bosnian Serbs and Croats were not willing to accept term Bosnian under any circumstaces. Big majority of them are still more proud about their Serb and Croat identity, rather than Bosnian. Bosniak is also turkish version of our name.<br>Bosniak/n", "comment_date": "2018-12-16T16:02:35Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "quantomic1106", "comment_text": "Is there anything this guy don&#39;t know?", "comment_date": "2018-03-24T12:51:07Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "vjeran vlahovic", "comment_text": "omg!i cant even tell you what a bad and inaccurate video you made!first error there is no such thing as serbo croatian language....it has never been!!!i am not going to try to explain to you because it wolud take to much time but do not use croatia and serbia in the sam sentance ever again!!!!", "comment_date": "2018-01-31T19:54:14Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Tariq BOSS", "comment_text": "well they categorized the language as Serbo-Croatian but it is Bosnian<br>because the first dictionary of a south slav language was Bosnian written by Mehmed Uskufi <br>in 16th century", "comment_date": "2018-01-17T16:26:40Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Joni Zymberi", "comment_text": "Remove Serbia from the Balkans and you solve 99% of the problems here.", "comment_date": "2017-03-13T15:56:51Z", "likes_count": 9}, {"comment_by": "Filip", "comment_text": "Three empires ruled the south Slavs, first the Byzantine empire, which was Eastern Orthodox and Greek cultured.

Often in Europe you have to do nothing more than stay in one place as the borders shift around you.  Ethnic groups having citizenship of a particular country do not make them loyal to that country.  For example in WW2 the German populations in other countries were loyal to Germany such as in the Sudetenland.
