If you have F = ma (force - mass times acceleration). and F/MA = 0.\n\nm x a cannot equal 0, otherwise F/ma = 0 would be undefined instead of 0. So if you have 1kg mass with no acceleration (0m/s^2) and force would be equal to 0. Does that mean that 0/0 is undefined? or just 0 ?", "comment_date": "2012-10-20T07:04:47Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "KoolScience", "comment_text": "i think he uses smoothdraw with a tablet", "comment_date": "2012-09-30T17:59:19Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Muneeb Khan", "comment_text": "somewhat yes, y=mx+b is when u have the value of m(which is the slope) and the value of b(which is the y intercept) but yes the formula is the same but right now he is not using the slope intercept form(that is wat it i called", "comment_date": "2012-07-13T17:48:29Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "L R", "comment_text": "pig: &quot;i think therefore i ham&quot;\n", "comment_date": "2012-06-26T13:32:11Z", "likes_count": 2}, {"comment_by": "skan150190", "comment_text": "Thank you for that!
