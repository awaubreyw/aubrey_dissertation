Private placements are common for companies that are trying to grow.  For example, many gold companies decide to initiate PP&#39;s to continue exploration or to finance a mining facility.

If the company is not a cash cow, it might have to place additional private placements.

If they don&#39;t care about their share price then nobody will want to subscribe to their placement.  No interest = No cash.

After a company performs an IPO, it is true that they receive the cash and they offer shares in return.  After the IPO the secondary market may seem like it doesn&#39;t affect the company but it does.  For one, the company has management and directors that are granted stock options that provide an incentive to be obsessed with getting their ticker as high as possible.  That way they may exercise them for secondary income on top of their salaries.", "comment_date": "2011-12-12T23:02:09Z", "likes_count": 2}}}, {"ywOr4OYqXOs": {"An IPO | Stocks and bonds | Finance & Capital Markets | Khan Academy": {"channel_id": "UgzEp4ywleyO2f7QekJ4AaABAg", "comment_by": "jvigus", "comment_text": "he has a top hat. and thank you very much for you for the vids dude\n", "comment_date": "2011-12-02T02:01:27Z", "likes_count": 3}}}, {"ywOr4OYqXOs": {"An IPO | Stocks and bonds | Finance & Capital Markets | Khan Academy": {"channel_id": "UgwxSAU272pHFk3-SM94AaABAg", "comment_by": "Ashley Mote", "comment_text": "Im looking for IPO&#39;S that I can offer low Credit Card Rates and ACH.
