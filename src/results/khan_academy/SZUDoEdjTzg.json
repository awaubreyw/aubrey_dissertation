Apparently, it says that: however random physical existence is, if a series of events can be given arithmetic values, the number 1 comes up most; then 2 and so on.  At first, this sounds like madness.  Complete random disorder has a god-like order?<br>While people can explain the results mathematically as here and it is often applied,  for example, in examining financial records to find evidence of fraud, I have not heard a fundamental explanation for it.<br>Then the reason struck me. Even though I was the biggest dunce at maths at school. Duh. <br>Every event has energy.  Every event has an effect on other events. These generate waves of energy.  <br>So, take any series of waves.  They go up and down, passing above and below zero.  And what is the most likely number nearest to zero? One. And the next likely value? Two. And so on.. This phenomenon may be described as the heart-beat of physical existence.<br>That\u2019s the only answer I can come up with that makes any sort of sense.  Maybe I should apply that in drawing a number in the Californian Lotto.
