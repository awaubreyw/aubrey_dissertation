One thing I want to make clear that is video does not is about the points in time where energy is released and absorbed (needed). There are a few processes where bonds are formed and broken in the model shown. In chemistry, when bonds are formed energy is released. Energy is needed, or absorbed, when a bond needs to be broken. Yes this includes the phosphate group bond in ATP!!! Even though the phosphate group bonds are unstable, it is still a form of stability which needs energy to break it (some people replace unstable with high energy, this is why I tend to disagree with that terminology). It just happens to be that the formation of the bond with the phosphate group and the oxygen in the water molecule is more stable and thus releases the energy. The placement of energy before and after in the system comes out to mean energy is released in this chemical reaction, but that is from the formation of the bond with water rather then the breaking of ATP.", "comment_date": "2021-10-15T11:37:38Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Firdaus Zainudin", "comment_text": "Imagine, the power station use ATP to generate electricity instead of coal, petroleum &amp; nuclear..
