The diversity, or lack of, was WITHIN a group or a tribe and that made any group more powerful and strong. The ones who could diversify within a group just ceased to exist.<br><br>The current idea of diversity is between populations, globalistation in one direction only Asia to Europe. We are not talking about genes only. Now we are talking about cultures and ways of life which are completely different. So in this case, diversity does not enhance that society, it weakens it because not a) either some cultures are given higher priority or b) No one culture is considered better than the others amd they are all considered equal. This allows for mini groups to be formed within societies who protect their cultures. This weakens the society as whole because these many cultures are either very protective of thier cultutes or they become diluted and absorb into a mix of many other cultures, losing their own identity and strength.<br>In Asia, Africa and Middle-east, you will not see a lot of diversity for the same reasons as above. These people know and protect thier cultures for a reason. While Europeans are determined to undermine their heritage and willing to &quot;diversify&quot; it. If the idea of diversity is that strong then these other continents should be forced to try it as well and there should be UN fund to educate these people to diversify. But this is not happening and one must ask why this is the case.", "comment_date": "2021-01-12T01:37:54Z", "likes_count": 0}}}, {"3NdTUkjwehs": {"Population diversity and resilience | Natural selection | AP Biology | Khan Academy": {"channel_id": "UgznnSzb2Q6DMA8aQ5d4AaABAg", "comment_by": "Rumford Chimpenstein", "comment_text": "if the environment is pure green, and a predator arrives that relies on sight, isn&#39;t the left population more resilient? each mixture is optimal for a different environment, &quot;environmental resilience&quot; is a misleading term for this reason.
