At <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgHksfBFbjk&amp;t=4m13s\">4:13</a>, after figuring out the length of BE, could you have also assumed the DE was of equal length since triangle BED has two 30 degree angles and is therefore isosceles? Meaning that BE and DE should be of equal lengths, correct? I think this would have been a simpler way of figuring out the length of DE.", "comment_date": "2017-09-23T21:58:19Z", "likes_count": 2}}}, {"dgHksfBFbjk": {"30-60-90 triangle example problem | Right triangles and trigonometry | Geometry | Khan Academy": {"channel_id": "UggaRlsKx_HAmXgCoAEC", "comment_by": "Nome", "comment_text": "<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgHksfBFbjk&amp;t=5m10s\">5:10</a> why are you so relatable", "comment_date": "2016-11-18T02:17:55Z", "likes_count": 5}}}, {"dgHksfBFbjk": {"30-60-90 triangle example problem | Right triangles and trigonometry | Geometry | Khan Academy": {"channel_id": "UgijLWVe6GVvSngCoAEC", "comment_by": "Jayiane Giro", "comment_text": "how [square root of 3] became [3 square root of 3 over 3]  ?", "comment_date": "2015-11-07T16:42:40Z", "likes_count": 1}}}, {"dgHksfBFbjk": {"30-60-90 triangle example problem | Right triangles and trigonometry | Geometry | Khan Academy": {"channel_id": "UgxeTRbqL7tTfU4ment4AaABAg", "comment_by": "emy", "comment_text": "An easier way (I paused the video before Sal started solving) was to find BE first (BEA - 30/60/90 triangle), then find BD(same as above, this time in the BDC triangle). You then notice that the measure of angle BDE is 30 (complementary angle) which is the same as DBE (trisector).\n\nFrom these you can see that BDE is an isosceles triangle so EB = DE.
