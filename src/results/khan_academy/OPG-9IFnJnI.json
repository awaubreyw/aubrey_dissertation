That was unnecessarily convoluted and inefficient.<br>Here is the easier way. Label the angles along the top line above the triangle, left to right, a, b, and c. Since they form a line, their sum is 180. Angles a and c are congruent to the triangle&#39;s lower right and left angles, respectively, because of the parallel lines theorem. Angle b is congruent to the to angle at the top of the triangle because they are vertical angles. So the triangle consists of three angles congruent to a, b, and c, which we know add up to 180. Therefore the triangle has 180 degrees.", "comment_date": "2016-02-16T19:32:57Z", "likes_count": 6}, {"comment_by": "Markalos", "comment_text": "The Pythagorean theorem is a squared+b squared=c squared.
