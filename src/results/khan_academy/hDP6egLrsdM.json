I&#39;m a carpenter developing better performing housing construction. I think one thing that might need adding is that A (area) in the formula is relative to volume, it&#39;s hard to visualise with the schematic of a single wall. I was picturing making a wall smaller to decrease A to decrease Q/t but that only works if its positively affecting its area/volume ratio. The sphere is the perfect example, as far away as you get from sphere you get the worse the volume to area ratio becomes right? So a cube is likely the best practical and efficient shape for a building (if you&#39;re not keen on building a hexagonal prism or something that complicated haha)", "comment_date": "2022-07-18T08:13:53Z", "likes_count": 0}}}, {"hDP6egLrsdM": {"Intuition behind formula for thermal conductivity | Physics | Khan Academy": {"channel_id": "Ugw754xQrWjxSq4XUdF4AaABAg", "comment_by": "Anonym ous \u200b", "comment_text": "<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hDP6egLrsdM&amp;t=10m45s\">10:45</a> how is there gravity in space \ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23", "comment_date": "2022-06-18T05:58:51Z", "likes_count": 0}}}, {"hDP6egLrsdM": {"Intuition behind formula for thermal conductivity | Physics | Khan Academy": {"channel_id": "UgzWU5oXSRyBB4Tza_x4AaABAg", "comment_by": "Sahan Ravindu", "comment_text": "thank you,sir", "comment_date": "2022-06-09T03:06:47Z", "likes_count": 1}}}, {"hDP6egLrsdM": {"Intuition behind formula for thermal conductivity | Physics | Khan Academy": {"channel_id": "Ugwa1h2H1OSwVqxXrol4AaABAg", "comment_by": "Sumit jaiswal", "comment_text": "Thank uh so much", "comment_date": "2022-03-28T12:08:24Z", "likes_count": 0}}}, {"hDP6egLrsdM": {"Intuition behind formula for thermal conductivity | Physics | Khan Academy": {"channel_id": "Ugw0JUMN8e6s6eho3uN4AaABAg", "comment_by": "BridgeWalley", "comment_text": "Holy c...

It makes things intuitive for me. This was especially useful to me in fluid mechanics, thermodynamics and mechanics of materials, ect. But with this equation something feels off. The distance d is expressed in meters and is in the x-direction.  The k term has meters in the denominator and is non-directional. These terms (m^2) cancel out the units from the area-- meters in the y direction and meters in the z direction. How can they cancel if they&#39;re not in the same direction?? I thought that was the point of cross products in physics- to combine terms that are the same units but are not in the same direction. I see no cross products here.
