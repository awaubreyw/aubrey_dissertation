[{"comment_by": "Alok Kumar Mishra", "comment_text": "This video is older than a decade but I hope that you will answer this.<br>Sir, could you please tell why did we take an interval of 1 feet( half feet on either side of the point) while calculating the probability of landing on lets say, 6 feet, via normal distribution chart. Also, since we know that we can not land on 5 feet , we could have taken a 1 feet interval on both the sides of the 6 feet point. Why does the result depends on the interval used for integration?

I think that this only gonna happen when both probabilities are equal in case of binomial distribution and argument behind this is that Bell curve is symmetric about mean. So when you have equal probability in case of Binomial Distribution, your choosing(choosing x out of n or choosing n-x out of n) becomes symmetrical and then Binomial can be easily approximated as Normal Distribution. <br>Let me know if I am wrong.", "comment_date": "2018-11-14T20:44:44Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Ganesh Deshmukh", "comment_text": "Please put this video after introduction to normal distribution.<br>Videos are not properly ordered.<br>First is normal distribution Excel sheet video then introduction to normal distribution.<br>Please update playlist orderings.", "comment_date": "2018-11-14T20:23:17Z", "likes_count": 2}, {"comment_by": "Ganesh Deshmukh", "comment_text": "Could you please explain me<br>How you got answer 0.0001?<br>@<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yTGEMoaWDCQ&amp;t=9m00s\">9:00</a>", "comment_date": "2018-11-14T18:23:50Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Ozzy Explains", "comment_text": "bro you meander too much.", "comment_date": "2018-08-04T21:53:17Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Mohammed Shafei", "comment_text": "Why are you talking about right and left steps?
