Love these videos. One question about assumptions, in general. In lots of these videos we use the pebble thing, which is an excellent way to understand things. I wondered, though, why the removal of the pebble or the replacement of the pebble is not considered in our calculations. Is that not also a form of work? This came to mind after your Maxwell&#39;s demon video, and you mention that the demon is part of the Q consideration. Not suggesting you&#39;re a demon, at all. Maybe I should go back and look at your intro to the pebble moment. Anyhow, just a minor question. I love your instruction!", "comment_date": "2019-03-16T00:52:28Z", "likes_count": 2}, {"comment_by": "Alfonsina Cipollone", "comment_text": "If only  he would have said which is the most efficient engine... <br>Hahah kidding thanks mate ur help is appreciated", "comment_date": "2018-04-08T04:20:09Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Melvin Paul", "comment_text": "you are great bro just keep d&#39;ing", "comment_date": "2018-01-15T06:30:27Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Siam", "comment_text": "Thank you", "comment_date": "2017-05-21T20:55:10Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Rituraj Borah", "comment_text": "well..I feel like Sal was in a kind of a hurry..", "comment_date": "2015-10-24T19:47:37Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Vipul Verma", "comment_text": "Timeline : <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQWwP7YYH6o&amp;t=8m17s\">8:17</a><br>Since we are adiabatically contracting, the volume of the air should reduce.
