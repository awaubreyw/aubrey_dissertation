If you&#39;re interested in getting saved say this beautiful prayer and mean it genuinely and you&#39;ll be saved by the grace of God<br> &quot;Dear Lord Jesus, I know that I am a sinner, and I ask for Your forgiveness. I believe You died for my sins and rose from the dead. I turn from my sins and invite You to come into my heart and life. I want to trust and follow You as my Lord and Savior.<br>&quot;<br>After getting saved you will need to continue to build your relationship with God which is possible through prayer, fasting, reading the Bible and even fellowship with other Christians. If you don&#39;t know how to pray you can start off with The Our Father Prayer found in Matthew 6:9-13; and if you don&#39;t know where to start when reading the Bible, start with the first four Gospels Matthew, Mark, Luke and John. Ik some versions of the Bible such as KJV may be hard to understand which is why i would recommend the NIV or the GNB for better understanding. <br>I&#39;m not tryna come off as better or holier than anyone by sharing my faith but mannn if y&#39;all only know how good God has been to me and how AMAZING He is to those who believe in him and seek him y&#39;all would for sure wanna be involved in his unconditional love !! Leave your questions if you have any and i&#39;ll try my best to answer them. I really love you all and pray that you will come to Christ\u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f", "comment_date": "2020-12-14T07:40:14Z", "likes_count": 1}}}, {"Hmwvj9X4GNY": {"Parts of a cell": {"channel_id": "Ugymu9Sla-nXJbIBasJ4AaABAg", "comment_by": "Arrianah", "comment_text": "take a shot every time he says endoplasmic reticulum<br><br>edit: he said endoplasmic reticulum about 25 times", "comment_date": "2020-11-08T10:14:30Z", "likes_count": 0}}}, {"Hmwvj9X4GNY": {"Parts of a cell": {"channel_id": "UgxZEjvgIMfLzfk2m1V4AaABAg", "comment_by": "Andrew Berg", "comment_text": "First comment in four years!
