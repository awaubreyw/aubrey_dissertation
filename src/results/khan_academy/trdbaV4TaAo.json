Not only did you bring up Googool, you mentioned your lovely wife and her attention to detail about adding a zero in front of decimals... I have clarity now! Last night I dreamt that the whole world had scientific notation as directions. My Ram truck dashboard read: &quot;Speed six to the 10&quot; and my Amazon orders was 1 to the negative tenth and I owed PayPal money in the negative tenths and so on. Today I will just ride my fat tire bike and forget about it for a while. Your cursive writing is APLUS... Like clouds in a world of ordered chaos. What will your Academy Award speech be about.? ? &quot;&quot; ? I hope world peace, because you are the only way out of this mess EG summation, No ads, No ads, clarity, nice voice, and you are helping some girl in Afghanistan bring about peace in her time.
