Constantinople was made the capital of ALL Rome in 330 and Ravena had remained the capital of WEST Rome since 402, so Rome being the Capital holds no credible argument. Rome was also sacked 410 which was the fall from grace of the capital. Even after 476, Rome was largely preserved (not razed), remained Christian and its senate still functioned until Justinian reconquered it around 555 (along with much of the West). Additionally, the reconquest of the West was crippled primarily by the Justinian Plague, not military defeat, which further makes the 476 date less sensible. Since Augustus, the East was always the bread basket and since the beginning, Roman civilisation was always heavily Greek influences. As far as Greek language goes, the whole of Rome NEVER just spoke Latin and languages split drastically so the cultural distinction is also senseless. The official language was changed to Greek in 620 but evidence for how heavily Heraculus\u2019 reforms were truely followed is lacking at best. Nobody ever doubted these were Eastern Romans, further proven by the fact sources call them \u2018Roman\u2019 except The HRE who INVENTED term Byzantine to tarnish the legitimacy of the Eastern Orthodox Church and strengthen the Catholic Pope and general military reverence of the west. There was a strong and bitter political war here to be the dominant power and influence which lead to the eventual sacking of Constantinople by the Catholic, western christians in 1204. Does the catholic crusade veering off course to cripple the (Christian) Roman Empire sounds like something you\u2019d want to rewrite as a western catholic historian? Because that\u2019s exactly what it became! Now let\u2019s look at how non-christians viewed Eastern Rome: The Sultanate of Rum (translates into Rome) was named from territory taken from East Rome in 1077 by the Seljuks as further proof this was the same Roman Empire in the eyes of Muslim world. When Mehmed II conquered Constantinople, he was declared Kayser-i Rum after he finished the Roman Empire. I use the term Byzantine as convention but it is a timestamp on the same, continuous empire. Those who use the 476 date and term, Byzantine, need to question the motivations their popularisation.", "comment_date": "2020-05-05T05:52:25Z", "likes_count": 5}, {"comment_by": "Zaid Akbar Siregar AR 4024", "comment_text": "You mean Roman empire vs new Roman empire ?", "comment_date": "2020-03-09T16:10:21Z", "likes_count": 6}, {"comment_by": "mert g\u00f6k\u00e7e", "comment_text": "nice crosshair", "comment_date": "2020-01-15T15:26:53Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Jing-Xing Xu", "comment_text": "Comparing Rome and Rome", "comment_date": "2019-12-08T10:47:41Z", "likes_count": 24}, {"comment_by": "feelsgoodman", "comment_text": "The Byzantine Empire IS the Eastern Roman Empire.  stop making such titles to end misconceptions.", "comment_date": "2019-04-02T16:24:08Z", "likes_count": 45}, {"comment_by": "Melooo182", "comment_text": "Aaaand not sure if already mentioned but the city of Roma was no longer the capital of Western Empire by 300AD, it was moved to Mediolanum (Milan) and later to Ravenna", "comment_date": "2019-01-20T19:54:19Z", "likes_count": 15}, {"comment_by": "DanTheMan", "comment_text": "The dislikes were from Byzantine people that want to be called roman", "comment_date": "2018-10-16T04:27:46Z", "likes_count": 4}, {"comment_by": "Father Louis Williams Suga Adams the 3rd jr. jr", "comment_text": "The other same thing is how the  religious authority submitted themselves before the Emperor, either in pagan Roman Empire or in Eastern Roman Empire (caesaropapism)", "comment_date": "2018-09-16T05:45:12Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "TsimpoukiaMeDoseis Theodosis", "comment_text": "Olympic games had lost their original values by the time of the Roman Empire, Theodosius forbid the pagan rituals that were essential for the games but sources mention that less and less wealthy people sponsoring them by 5th century, when ceased under Justinian I reign", "comment_date": "2018-09-16T01:47:26Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Christoffer Jespersen", "comment_text": "Constantine actually didn&#39;t keep the byzantium name or name it Constantinople its name was actually named Nova Roma &quot;New Rome&quot; however this was sadley changed after his death in his honour the renamed it to Constantinople which i find a less cooler name", "comment_date": "2018-08-31T14:01:45Z", "likes_count": 14}, {"comment_by": "Sto_Karfi!", "comment_text": "no no no, the theme system isn&#39;t feudal, is what it should to be in order to keep the central authority strong!It&#39;s complicated,but to give an example, when Alexios I demanded oaths of loyalty from the crusaders, they(unwillingly) accepted by using the feudal ritual, something Alexios didn&#39;t understood clearly in depth.Later with the fall of constantinople to the crusaders the feudal system comes and mixes with the theme making it easy today to think that was the same...", "comment_date": "2018-05-13T11:46:04Z", "likes_count": 16}, {"comment_by": "David Komn", "comment_text": "It was the same empire.", "comment_date": "2018-05-11T19:37:02Z", "likes_count": 6}, {"comment_by": "David Quezada", "comment_text": "Byzantine should be way better <br>In all ways", "comment_date": "2018-04-25T01:07:17Z", "likes_count": 3}, {"comment_by": "Se\u00f1or DT", "comment_text": "Christian Rome &gt; Pagan Rome", "comment_date": "2018-04-09T00:43:34Z", "likes_count": 8}, {"comment_by": "TheBro", "comment_text": "there is something amazed me... why the Byzantine suddenly started communicate with Greek instead of Latin? who decided this and why?", "comment_date": "2017-11-07T20:22:57Z", "likes_count": 3}, {"comment_by": "nikolaos dimopoulos", "comment_text": "Its not Byzantine Empire.
