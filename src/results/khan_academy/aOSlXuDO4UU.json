Other youtube tutorials used U = Q - W initially. For example: what is the change of internal energy in the system if 300J of heat is added and 200J of work done on the system. In analyzing, Q is +300J while W is -200J. For other tutorials, they used the formula: U= Q - W, hence U = +300 - (-200J) = +500J. While the tutorials here, the formula will based on the analysis, hence: U = +300J - 200J = +100J. What is really the correct way of solving internal energy?
