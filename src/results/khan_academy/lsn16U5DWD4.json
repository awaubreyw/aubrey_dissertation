In the real world there is a bigger problem regarding the amount charged not by the government via tax, but by monopoles from producers with the epipen being just one example.

So, how to (economically) motivate consumers to pay more but legally apart from eventual criminilazation and risk of penalties? Should goods with inelastic demand be taxed less in general? Is there a way to consider elasticity of demand when applying a tax?<br>Thanks to who is able to answer!", "comment_date": "2018-09-14T11:05:33Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Cheydinal", "comment_text": "I don&#39;t get why the pharma company would price insulin af 75$ if they could easily make 30% more by demanding 100$.
