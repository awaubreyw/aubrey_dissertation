They also compared the ancient Teopancazco results with DNA from nine modern Native Mexican populations, which showed that the ancient skeletons were close to people from Tepehuan, Zapotec, Maya, and Mixtec populations. \u201cThese data suggest that the population of the initial phase of Teopancazco (Tlamimilolpa, AD 200-350) was composed mainly by local people and by foreigners from sites belonging to the Teotihuacan corridor to the Gulf Coast,\u201d the authors explain. \u00a0The fact that there was limited contact with other distant populations \u201csuggests a lower genetic diversity during this time in comparison to the final phase of the Teopancazco history (the Xolalpan phase), characterized by the possible expansion of exchange routes between Teotihuacan and Mesoamerica,\u201d they conclude.<br><br>The researchers also did DNA testing on infants, which is the only way to tell from the skeleton whether the child was male or female, in light of the suggestion that some of these babies may have been sacrificed. In their sample, there were seven female infants and five male infants. \u00a0More interesting than the balanced sex ratio, though, was the fact that the male infants showed greater genetic diversity. \u201cThis is the first time that hypotheses based on genetic data in relation to infant sacrifices in Mesoamerican populations are proposed,\u201d the authors comment, and the data suggest that additional research may produce more answers to the question of child sacrifice at Teotihuacan.<br><br>\u201cBefore our research,\u201d the authors write, \u201ccomprehensive genetic studies aimed to better understand the multiethnicity in this site had not been carried out.\u201d Their results show that, although Teopancazco was genetically diverse, its people came from areas and groups living close by. \u00a0They are also the first group to suggest, based on DNA data, a relationship between infants and burial styles in the \u201ctermination ritual\u201d in the transitional phase of the site.", "comment_date": "2021-10-30T18:50:24Z", "likes_count": 0}}}, {"HPRPaTqNnZk": {"Mayans and Teotihuacan | World History | Khan Academy": {"channel_id": "UgxPSrWWyIzGCgrnV6F4AaABAg", "comment_by": "beastboyom", "comment_text": "Wow I love Khan academy", "comment_date": "2021-06-24T04:59:17Z", "likes_count": 0}}}, {"HPRPaTqNnZk": {"Mayans and Teotihuacan | World History | Khan Academy": {"channel_id": "UgwkgYtwRI0iDf-m9sx4AaABAg", "comment_by": "House Of Masculinity", "comment_text": "ahhh my ancestors.....", "comment_date": "2021-03-25T04:07:53Z", "likes_count": 1}}}, {"HPRPaTqNnZk": {"Mayans and Teotihuacan | World History | Khan Academy": {"channel_id": "UgwD9UhlcuX-q6tCS2x4AaABAg", "comment_by": "Amelia Cardwell", "comment_text": "Doing this for homework but my mans enthusiasm is so great I\u2019m not bored \u263a\ufe0f", "comment_date": "2020-12-02T20:45:50Z", "likes_count": 0}}}, {"HPRPaTqNnZk": {"Mayans and Teotihuacan | World History | Khan Academy": {"channel_id": "UgymSXLfeOeXwms6Lg54AaABAg", "comment_by": "Peabody Sherman", "comment_text": "The teacher made us watch this for homework.
