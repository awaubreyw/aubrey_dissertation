However, I have a better way to calculate the Real GDP:\n     $15,294.3 bn/ REAL GDP = 102.5/100\n Since the product of the Means = product of the extremes, We have:\n     $15,294.3 X 100 = REAL GDP X 102.5 Divide each side by 102.5  This gives us:\n     $15,294.3 X 100/102.5 = REAL GDP \n     $14,921.26 = REAL GDP 2011 or rounded = $14,921.3 bn\nBest Regards,\nRobert Del Rosso    rdelrosso2001@yahoo.com\n\n\n\n\n\n \n", "comment_date": "2012-02-19T08:33:31Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "PAIDEGUINHA", "comment_text": "third place", "comment_date": "2012-02-13T23:17:45Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "JJI", "comment_text": "Keep these video coming!
