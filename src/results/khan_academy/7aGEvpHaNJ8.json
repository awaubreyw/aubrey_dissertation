So u will find that ABC and dec are similar. Using this we can find ac:CE and then find ae and then by basic proportionality theorem we can find CF .", "comment_date": "2019-06-15T15:07:09Z", "likes_count": 2}}}, {"7aGEvpHaNJ8": {"Challenging similarity problem | Similarity | Geometry | Khan Academy": {"channel_id": "UgwBXy94bb2-ivKt0DB4AaABAg", "comment_by": "Travel with Krish", "comment_text": "You just lengthened it up its just a three step sum.", "comment_date": "2019-01-21T03:08:21Z", "likes_count": 1}}}, {"7aGEvpHaNJ8": {"Challenging similarity problem | Similarity | Geometry | Khan Academy": {"channel_id": "UgycvWNLr2Cqu1xZI7F4AaABAg", "comment_by": "UK LEARNING HUB", "comment_text": "Sir i have question please help me to solve this", "comment_date": "2018-08-19T17:05:15Z", "likes_count": 0}}}, {"7aGEvpHaNJ8": {"Challenging similarity problem | Similarity | Geometry | Khan Academy": {"channel_id": "UgxcPA6vcBEvB7DA2IZ4AaABAg", "comment_by": "Damien Glover", "comment_text": "Why is FE y-x?
