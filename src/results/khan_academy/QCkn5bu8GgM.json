Russia started to fight on its own front against bolshewiek uprising, and the French had mass desertions, and couldnt hold on. But the People Hitler and the others were upset about? were the people who told the British to hold on, because they would get America involved. and they did;prolonging the war with another 2 years, and THEN putting the Blame for WW1 on German, who did NOT start this War.

To be\u00a0 more specific, my thesis highlighted the events, philosophies and ideologies of Hitler and the SS and how the Five permanent members of the United Nations whole heartily agreed with Hitlers beliefs, but all knew that it could only be accomplished through a generational plan unlike the Ten year plan Hilter had in store for Germany and the world at that time. I warned that we would see the full fruition of Hitlers beliefs fulfilled in my lifetime. It was extremely specific, I used documents from resources such as the library of Congress to show my research. I did receive an A for my paper and it was published in our universities magazine and newspaper. Skip forward to today...As of now, the medical profession is doing its part as well as the technology industries in fulfilling the agreed upon agendas including the Media doing its part in promulgating propaganda and silencing the dissidents. Next will be the militaries turn, they will become involved. Just like in Germany during Hitlers time in power.. This is when things get really bad. This model is nothing more than a re-do from Hitlers play book. This time, everyone is on board unlike the first time when a world War ensued. This old agenda has been renamed a few times, and each time with the name changes are policy and agenda changes, this is due to technology advances. You may have known it as a familiar name, and now its been renamed once again, from its original name called the Third Reich, to the New World Order,\u00a0 now its current name is known as the Great Reset. All of these names are one in the same. They derived from the root. That root has flourished over the last Seventy-five years to its current state. It can not be uprooted by any man or group of men. It has taken hold, it has smothered out the smaller roots around its base, leaving it the power that can not be checked by man or nation.
