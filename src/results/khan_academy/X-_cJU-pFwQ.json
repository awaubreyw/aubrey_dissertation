Pushyamitra Shung used to torture the Buddhists and the people here, and on the strength of strength, the character (Hindu) religion was accepted by them as Manusmrtha composed by Brahmins.<br><br>\ud83d\udc46\ud83c\udffb * Greek King Milind had the right to the north-west region. King Milind was a follower of Buddhism. As soon as Raja Milind discovered that Pushyamitra Shung was torturing the Buddhists, he attacked Pataliputra. The people of Pataliputra also set up a revolt against Pushyamitra Sung, after which Pushyamitra Shung fled and saved the followers of Jain religion in Ujjaini *.<br><br>* As soon as this incident happened to King Kharwail of Kalinga, he declared his independence and attacked Pataliputra *. * Pataliputra pushed the Greek King Milind to the North West. *<br>\ud83d\udc46\ud83c\udffb * After this Brahmin Pushyamitra Shung Ram joined with his supporters in the middle area of \u200b\u200bPataliputra and Shialakot and made his capital Saket. Pushyamitra Shung changed his name to Ayodhya. Ayodhya i.e.-built capital without war ... *<br><br>\ud83d\udc46\ud83c\udffb * After making the capital, Pushyamitra Shung Ram announced that any person who brings the heads of the Buddhist monks, will be given a reward of 100 gold coins. Thus, the slaughter of the gold coins has led to the massacre of Buddhist monks across the country. The heads of Buddhist monks started coming to the capital. After this some drivers used to steal their brought head and take the gold mud by showing the king again. The King came to know that people are also cheating on this, then the king kept a big stone and seeing the head of the monarch, the monk, killed him on the stone, and wasting his face. After this, the head of a Buddhist monk was thrown into the river Ghaghra *.<br> * There were so many heads of Buddhist monks in the capital Ayodhya that the name of the river with the shredded heads was named Sarvorda, which has now become &quot;Sarai&quot; in the present.<br>\ud83d\udc46\ud83c\udffb * On the banks of this &quot;Sarayu&quot; river, Rajavi Valmiki of Pushyamitra Shung wrote &quot;Ramayana&quot;. Describing the Maurya emperors as Pushyamitra Shung and Ram as &quot;Ravan&quot;, in which Ram had praised his capital Ayodhya and received much more awards from the king. Not only this, the composition of many fictitious Brahmin religious texts like Ramayana, Mahabharata, memories, etc. also happened in the Ayodhya of Pushyamitra Sung, on the banks of &quot;Sarayu&quot; river.<br><br>\ud83d\udc46\ud83c\udffb Due to the massacre of Buddhist monks, all Buddhist Vihars have become empty. Then the Arya Brahmins thought, &#39;What will happen to these Buddhist monasteries that the coming generation never know what it was in the past years *<br>* Then they changed all these Buddhist monasteries into the temples and established their ancestors and fictional characters, gods and goddesses in the form of God and opened these shops in the name of worship.<br><br>\ud83d\udc46\ud83c\udffb Note that before the killing of the great Maurya Maurya, there was no word of temple in India, nor this kind of nature. At present, there is a tradition of breaking the coconut by killing stones at Brahmin religion.
