From the perspective of physical chemistry, energy is released only when bonds are formed.  In the case of ATP, simply cleaving ATP is actually an energy investment - energy is only gained when the third phosphate becomes attached to another molecule. As an example, the free P may causes changes to the shape of an enzyme, which, in attaining a more energetic form, may facilitate the otherwise hefty amino-tRNA synthesis.", "comment_date": "2011-06-28T14:33:45Z", "likes_count": 0}}}, {"YQfWiDlFEcA": {"ATP: Adenosine Triphosphate": {"channel_id": "UgwlR6bJM7afiBEtqJh4AaABAg", "comment_by": "Aadam", "comment_text": "Hey, what does a muscle contraction cost? 80p...", "comment_date": "2011-06-21T16:11:14Z", "likes_count": 5}}}, {"YQfWiDlFEcA": {"ATP: Adenosine Triphosphate": {"channel_id": "UgwqxVAEWiGWKAliSIR4AaABAg", "comment_by": "Gregory Burton", "comment_text": "I wish you were my professor.
