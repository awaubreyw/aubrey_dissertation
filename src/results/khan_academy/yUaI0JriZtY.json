That being the case, the first three pairings are the same as the second three pairings and thus its only three ways instead of six. Since I don&#39;t know the answer I am left to only speculate as to whether my logic is accurate or flawed.", "comment_date": "2017-04-22T03:46:56Z", "likes_count": 7}}}, {"yUaI0JriZtY": {"Finding probability example | Probability and Statistics | Khan Academy": {"channel_id": "UghlnshT7ngUoHgCoAEC", "comment_by": "Syed", "comment_text": "Thanks for the video.<br>Allah may bless you :)", "comment_date": "2017-04-15T18:48:55Z", "likes_count": 29}}}, {"yUaI0JriZtY": {"Finding probability example | Probability and Statistics | Khan Academy": {"channel_id": "UghTKqYbIsfaRHgCoAEC", "comment_by": "Sugar Plum", "comment_text": "Thank you!
