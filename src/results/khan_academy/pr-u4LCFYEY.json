My humble contribution to this, &#39;s in time <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pr-u4LCFYEY&amp;t=9m09s\">9:09</a>, when you said that an increase in sigma (historical volatility), makes D1 go up and D2 down in value, which it&#39;s not quite accurate, I&#39;m certain it&#39;s because you speaking in rough terms to be easier to understand.\r<br>\r<br><br>As my understanding goes, an increase in volatility (sigma) makes BOTH D1 and D2 increase in value, but the ratio of this increase in D1 is greater. Which makes the difference, between them, and their fore between N(D1) and N(D2) greater. And that&#39;s why an increase in volatility alone makes the premium of a call option, as the example, have an increase in value. More specifically Extrinsic value. The outcome in the premium it&#39;s the same, but I humbly believe that&#39;s this&#39;s more the case in that situation.\r<br>\r<br><br>Sorry for the bad English, I&#39;m a foreigner and I love the videos.
