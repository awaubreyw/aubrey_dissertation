[{"comment_by": "Filippo Bravi", "comment_text": "i think that there is a mistake in this video: when you definde the type 1 surface, you wrote R : ...., but R is the scalar function for the z axis, not the integral domain (the integral domain is S). thank you for these video!", "comment_date": "2018-02-10T10:37:00Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Perfect_English", "comment_text": "Thanks for the video. Two questions! First, why are those integrals of these particular types? Second, isn&#39;t f a function of x y and z? so why did you put f(x,y) for the limit and not f(x,y,z) ?<br>&#39;", "comment_date": "2013-12-18T14:28:29Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "daniel343ful", "comment_text": "I gonna get this someday", "comment_date": "2013-09-11T02:55:01Z", "likes_count": 4}, {"comment_by": "Erica Bauserman", "comment_text": "ArF.", "comment_date": "2012-06-28T22:28:15Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "kedem12345", "comment_text": "so we define surfase 3 as the &quot;vertical&quot; &quot;connection&quot; between our upper and lower bounds? and say that any 3rd surface that is not parallel to the k component, is irrelevant, because it can be included in one form or another, within our surfaces 1 and 2 (meaning, if you devide to 3 surfaces, and your 3 isn&#39;t parallel to the k, that means your deciding is wrong)?\n(This is the rationalization I made to myself, just wanted to make sure it wasn&#39;t total nonsence)", "comment_date": "2012-06-28T01:43:32Z", "likes_count": 0}]
