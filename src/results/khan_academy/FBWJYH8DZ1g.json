Typically a price is given, and then the consumer decides how much they want at that price.....sort of expressed as Q = f(P).  Because we are typically in the position of having to derive a demand curve, using probability distributions of demand-side characteristics (i.e. demand destruction), and those probability distributions usually relate to the independent variable in a function, how should we normalize such relationships?", "comment_date": "2022-03-15T19:32:23Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Keonne Brown", "comment_text": "Thank you!", "comment_date": "2022-01-27T10:50:13Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "James Samuel", "comment_text": "nice vibes much love", "comment_date": "2022-01-11T19:54:30Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Ayesha Anjum", "comment_text": "This guy really said elas-titty at <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBWJYH8DZ1g&amp;t=5m09s\">5:09</a>....im dead\ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\udc80", "comment_date": "2021-12-10T19:24:17Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Hermano", "comment_text": "Got a test tmr lmao", "comment_date": "2021-11-29T14:38:21Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Laurent Maldague", "comment_text": "U know what we got here?
