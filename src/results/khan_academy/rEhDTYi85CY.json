[{"comment_by": "ayouness1960", "comment_text": "I have the opposite problem with my teen. He is an overachiever, and spends eight to twelve hours a day on his studies taking copious notes in preparation for his AP exams. He&#39;s a senior patrol leader in boy scouts and plays in several bands at school. Since Covid, there are no band rehearsals, no scouting activities or boys to lead; but he&#39;s still spending hours and hours on his studies. I want him to take time off to go outside and get fresh air, toss the Frisbee, take a walk. How do I get him to slow down and listen? He gets so irritated with me for gently knocking on his door to ask if he wants a bite to eat or to take a break. I worry about him getting burnt out as he prepares for his senior year in high school. (He&#39;s always been an overachiever - straight A student.)", "comment_date": "2020-05-01T00:44:52Z", "likes_count": 4}, {"comment_by": "Christa Free", "comment_text": "None of that works for teenagers.
