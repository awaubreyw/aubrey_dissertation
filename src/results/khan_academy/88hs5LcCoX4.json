For example, a simple list of integer numbers maps out a virtual reality; each entry in the list represents one particle. The value of each list entry is a pointer to the virtual location the particle is positioned in. Just by defining this simple list, we instantly have all the makings of a digital Universe! We can define:<br><br><br>1) Matter : The list of particles <br><br>2) Space: The set of locations that can be pointed to. How Big is space? How big can you process the numbers in the list... F.Y.I. it cannot be infinite because infinite numbers cannot be processed.<br>3) Occupation: If a number in the list points to a location, it is occupied, otherwise it is empty.<br>4) Co-occupation: If more than one list entry points to the same location, it is considered to be co-occupied.<br>5) Relative distance: the distance between two particles in the list is easy to determine as simple because the numbers implicitly represent Cartesian coordinates of Grid Locations (GL).<br><br><br>The list defines the state of the Universe at &quot;an instant in time&quot;. \u00a0If every particle was located in the same location, say, 0,0,0 (the center of a 3-dimentional Universe) that would be called the &quot;pre-big-bang state&quot;. In this case, the X, Y, and Z DIMENSIONS are indicated by three numbers in each list entry.<br><br><br>OK, now, by changing the value of the numbers in this list, we MOVE MATTER around from location to location! The numbers can be changed by using a set of RULES to change them. This set of rules is called an ALGORITHM, for example, &quot;ADD ONE TO THE X--VALUE OF THE ODD NUMBERED ENTRIES&quot; would move the odd numbered list entries one GL to the right, by virtue of changing their location pointer values.<br><br><br>This results in a NEW STATE of the Universe. But note, it all happens at once, kind of like in the game of chess more than one piece can be re-positioned in a single &#39;move&quot;. Once this NUMERIC TRANSACTION has completed, the Universe &quot;instantly&quot; assumes this new state. OK, now, at this juncture, the same algorithm can be re-applied to this new state, resulting in yet another successive state. We have just defined TIME!!! Time is the sequential ordering of these state changes, one after another. Important to note, it does not matter how long it takes these calculations to be completed for the sequence to remain intact... to the characters within this virtual reality, time is ONLY based upon the sequence of state changes, not upon the time it takes to render them. I call these &quot;TICKS of Universe time&quot;.<br><br><br>In our simple example algorithm, we moved all of the odd numbered particles in the list one GL per every tick of Universe time. This &quot;SPEED&quot; is based upon the framework of the algorithm... if we called this &quot;the speed of light&quot;, then we can use it to define slower speeds that matter is allowed to be moved around at. So, the speed of light is not an arbitrary constant, it is based upon the implicit framework of the algorithm running against Cartesian coordinates in successive processing steps.<br><br><br>NOW, in this scenario, if a particle only moves every other tick, how fast is it moving? It is moving at 1/2 c. If it waits two ticks, then hops one GL, it is moving at 1/3 c. Speed is all based upon waiting for a count of ticks, and then hopping one GL!!!<br><br><br>Let us assume that this is the case, for reasons of simplicity in the design. OK? In this scenario, the Universe operates a lot different from what we implicitly assume in a time-space-continuum. The Universe either IS or it IS NOT informational. If it IS, then it must operate DIGITALLY and these ideas of hopping instantly from one location to the next and pausing in-between hops must be considered! It always comes down to a matter of GRANULARITY... there must always be finite limits to all of the processing... infinite resolution is not possible because it would require infinite processing to complete any transaction in the sequence. Since we do appear to move, I claim that this proves the Universe is DIGITAL!<br><br><br>But if you look closely at what I&#39;m proposing, you can assume that typically, matter doesn&#39;t move anywhere near the speed of light... typically, all matter is FROZEN in the grid and only moves on rare occasions. In fact, I am proposing that light is never emitted from matter whilst it is in motion, and also that matter cannot absorb previously emitted light whist in motion... again, it deals with the simplicity of the design, and let us make this assumption as well. OK?<br><br><br><br>Anyways, what about the Either?? What about the Michelson-Morley experiment? LOOK AT THIS DIAGRAM...<br><br><br><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Michelson-morley_calculations.svg\">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Michelson-morley_calculations.svg</a><br><br><br><br>They expected a difference in the behavior of light because the emitting matter is moving faster in one of the directions through the Either than through another direction. This was very much like the Einstein train throwing light from it whilst it moves compared to someone standing next to the train track. This is what they can&#39;t understand about light, in general, and this resulted in the Lorenz transformation and special relativity.<br><br><br>But wait! I&#39;m claiming that matter is always frozen in the grid when it emits light and also when it absorbs light... the v (velocity) in the above diagram is always zero... that&#39;s why the experiment &quot;failed&quot;... it was based upon the assumption of a time-space continuum where matter can be emitted from a particle while it is in motion. This minor oversight has led us into 130 years of total confusion. There is an Either... it is the grid of locations in virtual space that can be pointed to by integer numbers in a list.<br><br><br>Marty, 26-May-2019", "comment_date": "2019-05-26T16:13:44Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Shimul", "comment_text": "Thank you", "comment_date": "2019-05-19T06:24:45Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "JRC", "comment_text": "What if the ether is stationary?", "comment_date": "2019-05-08T01:46:02Z", "likes_count": 2}, {"comment_by": "shelly Hooper", "comment_text": "Please, Dont use the metric system to measure distance.", "comment_date": "2019-04-14T11:10:40Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Theorica", "comment_text": "Light has no speed.

It makes much more sense if you consider the aether as integral to inertia and moving exactly as anything moves within it.  If there were any relative motion to detect it would likely be some distance from the Earth (i.e. like a pressure wave in front of your hand moving through a pool.)  Likewise you wouldn&#39;t see a difference in the propagation of light save for experiments of induced aether drag, like the Fizeau experiment.", "comment_date": "2017-08-05T20:00:34Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Nada Yabiznas", "comment_text": "it&#39;s like measuring the flow of a river by only measuring across it from bank to bank.", "comment_date": "2017-04-17T04:30:15Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Jud citizen", "comment_text": "Hint:  Just say &quot;Ether.&quot;  You don&#39;t have to stumble over &quot;Luminiferous&quot; every time.
