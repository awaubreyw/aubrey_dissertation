It simultaneously idealises free markets and their ability to give people what they want. It gets away with this contradiction through the doctrines of adam smith, that individual competition leads to ideal outcomes. But where open market competition and individual profiteering conflict, as here, the economist still takes the perspective of self-interest. Smith&#39;s simultaneous advocation of individualism and free markets is inconsistent, and the individualism he spawned is taking precedence over his market system. This is the discourse of the powerful, the discourse that says &quot;screwing you over is fine because in the big picture it&#39;s in your interests&quot; when in fact it isn&#39;t, it&#39;s just screwing you over", "comment_date": "2017-03-07T11:48:44Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Michael Amir", "comment_text": "isn&#39;t every state, except for the nash equilibrium stat, a Pareto\u00a0optimal state?", "comment_date": "2016-06-09T15:49:57Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "lexagon", "comment_text": "Unfortunately this video paints a somewhat misleading and simplified picture. The problem arises that real life duopolies/cartels aren&#39;t usually based on single market transactions, but on iterated transactions. Iterating games essentially means that a participant doesn&#39;t have just one chance to make a strategic decision, as it would be in a single transaction situation, but instead there are multiple subsequent transaction and the participant can constantly re-evaluate their strategy during every single transaction. Essentially the participants replay the game constantly and remember all of their own previous strategies in individual iterations as well those of the other parties&#39;. This leads to some major differences from what is portrayed in the video above, which is what I&#39;ll attempt to explain below.<br><br>All of the following is assuming that MPC, market demand structure, average unit cost etc. do not vary with time and the participants have perfect information.\u00a0<br><br>In a single, discrete case of Prisoner&#39;s dilemma, the Nash equilibrium is always non-cooperation. However, if you iterate the prisoner&#39;s dilemma indefinitely and the parties know that the game will be replayed, the Nash equilibrium moves from not cooperating to cooperation. This has to do with the fact that they know that the next iteration of the game will also give them a profit if they cooperate and they can assign a value for it, provided that there&#39;s enough reliable data without excess noise (I won&#39;t go into games with imperfect/asymmetric information, with market variables and probability). The notion is generally called discounted cash flow, or DCF for short.\u00a0<br><br>In this scenario, the participants will discount their anticipated profits from all future iterations and take them into account while making strategic decisions in every single iteration, which radically alters the payoff matrix. An important factor in the discounting process is that duopolies and cartels usually have a somewhat unforgiving trigger strategy in regards to cooperation, in which if the other one decides not to cooperate (undercut cartel prices or increase production), it will lead to the other party &quot;losing trust&quot; and not cooperating for the rest of the iterations of the game, thus returning to the classic Nash equilibrium of the Prisoner&#39;s dilemma. Simply put, an attempt by one party at hogging the cartel profits will lead to the collapse of the cartel and both participants returning to perfect competition, exactly in the manner as shown in this video. This leads to the following point: if the game is iterated indefinitely, the profits from cooperation are infinitely higher than not cooperating, the latter of which would result in the loss of all future cartel profits due to the grim trigger. If the discounted cash flow from cooperation now and in future iterations will always be higher than non-cooperation, neither party can improve its strategy by undercutting prices or increasing production. The Nash equilibrium hops over to the Pareto Efficient solution (in the reference frame of the participants of the game, not society as a whole).<br><br>All this complex jargon can be summed up by the old idiom of the stupidity of killing the goose that lays golden eggs in hopes for a quick slightly higher one-time profit. I appreciate the attempt at just explaining the basics, but unfortunately the basics lead to oversimplification and demonstrably false models. To truly understand cartel behavior in game theory, you a) have to differentiate between single games and iterated games, and b) understand basic trigger strategies and which of them applies in any given model.", "comment_date": "2015-07-27T01:42:01Z", "likes_count": 7}, {"comment_by": "Laureano Luna", "comment_text": "Sal&#39;s result that the Nash equilibrium for duopoly is at 0 economic profit contradicts the theory of Cournot duopoly, where the Nash equlibrium for the firms lies before they reach the perfect competence production.
