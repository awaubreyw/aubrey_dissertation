They came from inner part of Africa.<br><br>Again, it is well known that Ta-seti shows the beginning of ancient Egyptian civilization, including the medu neter(hieroglyphs) .<br>Again, there were at least 12 Pharohs in Ta-seti before the first pharoh in Egypt...<br><br>We shouldn&#39;t also forget that egypt was and still part of Africa... Any attempt by anybody to move it to western Asia which is mistakenly called middle east is a lie ..<br><br>We should also know that the first 1000yrs of the dynastic period in Egypt were purely Africans and had not had any non African interference.<br><br>The pyramids were built between 3rd and 6th dynasty.....and the first  hebrew(Abraham) was born in the 13 dynasty.... Meaning, there was no Isaac, no Jacob, no Joseph.<br>Again... There are physical evidence, I repeat physical evidence of cultures and practices of ancient  Egyptians who moved inward of Africa because of the constant attack of Egypt by foreigners.<br><br>Moreover, Herodotus writes that the Egyptians and Ethiopians appeared as the same people.. Black face with wholly hair...<br>And even  said Zeus and Apollo were from Africa.. And they had to return to Africa at least once a year to renew their immortality.<br>We should also know that another name for Zeus is Aeithiop which means black God or burnt face....<br><br><br>Be honest and straightforward in your video.....<br>There were so many attacks on Egypt<br>Hyksos, Assyrians,Persians,Greeks,Romans,Muslim Arabs(in just AD640) , later the Frenchs and what have you....<br>There have been so many presence of foreigners (I mean non Africans/ non black people) in Egypt.. Majority of the native Africans moved inward of Africa and the rest stayed at the modern day south of Egypt... Others intermarried.....
