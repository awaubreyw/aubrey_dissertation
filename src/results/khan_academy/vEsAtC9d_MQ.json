His teaching diagrams and commentary were so much like this one--focusing on the dynamics of forces and gradients. Like Diana Rogava says below, the amazing action of how oxygen gets split away from the water is not really explained by most instructors. They are too focused on naming everything--and aren&#39;t seeing the big driving forces and the recovery methods. These 2-bit instructors (1 of them was head of my whole biology department) didn&#39;t comprehend how hugely, dangerously powerful the photons are, and didn&#39;t understand that the photon drives an electron into a crazed hyperactive condition, causing the electron to leave behind a huge negativity when it exits.  This enables Chlorophyll 680 to do an otherwise impossible oxidation of the tightly-bound water molecule--it rips off the oxygen so it can regain an electron for the next excitation. The H+ in the meantime accumulates, providing for gradients that cause photosynthesis to continue. And there is another type of pigment that is usually present in Photosystem II, carotenes, that detoxify the photon&#39;s radiation damage to lipids in the surrounding membrane. As you can see, the antioxidants important in your diet are crucial to the plant, too.", "comment_date": "2019-11-22T07:25:39Z", "likes_count": 15}}}, {"vEsAtC9d_MQ": {"Conceptual overview of light dependent reactions": {"channel_id": "Ugy8BXjA_Tx2jBZRhHl4AaABAg", "comment_by": "Omnia Youssef", "comment_text": "I owe you alot", "comment_date": "2019-10-17T21:28:55Z", "likes_count": 3}}}, {"vEsAtC9d_MQ": {"Conceptual overview of light dependent reactions": {"channel_id": "UgzNs6IHmUZ0T2Dw2JZ4AaABAg", "comment_by": "Diana Rogava", "comment_text": "I never understood why water was split into oxygen and hydrogen!
