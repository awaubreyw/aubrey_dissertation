You are talking about the most superficial layer of economics and the truth is that modern economic models rest of very specific assumptions which, when stated fully, make no sense. It is unclear if you are fully informed. E.g., monetarism forms the base of some branches of mainstream economics but monetarism rests on an assumption of perfect foresight of monetary income over every agent&#39;s lifetime. This is necessary for the math and the metaphysics but it makes no sense. Furthermore, they would be computing this in utilities and thus one would have to understand the future stock of goods upon which their forecast of income rest. The whole thing is absolutely ridiculous and it is high time the profession move on. If the premises are wrong then so are the conclusions. These are not simplifications but silly myth and you are unknowingly perpetuating it. I&#39;d like an hour with Bill Gates to explain the issue, to stop you from doing future damage. In sum, by focusing on mathematical economics, you are ignoring a huge body of literature and are, in my view, merely repeating the errors of superficial academic minds. The truth is that only a tiny fraction of the economics profession is represented by the views you shared -- it just happens to be the most influential minority. That minority, you will find, form an ideology which is either derived from the model or the model from the ideology (it is unclear which way causation moves). Thus, in my view, you are doing damage by repeating the old line when, in 2017, it is time for sanity to prevail. We cannot continue along the mathematical line due to its contradictions and absurdities. And there are better models waiting in the wings. Thus, please stop hurting the public.
