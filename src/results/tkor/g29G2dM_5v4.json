Firstly most salts are soluble in water due to waters electonegativity. Due to huge difference between the electronegativity between oxygen and hydrogen it makes it a huge candidate for dissolving salts. This is becuase water is classified as a polar substance, and polar substances generally are perfect fpr dissolving salts. While oils and ethonal are not perfect candidates, due to their polrity. Oil and ethonal are classified as non polar substances.
