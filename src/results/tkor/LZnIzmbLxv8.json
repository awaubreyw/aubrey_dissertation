This is unusual; normally the top and sides of the rolls are directly exposed to the heat of the oven, while the bottom is shielded by a baking sheet (which starts at room temperature). I think that&#39;s why the bottom of the roll was crispy.<br><br>So at this point you might expect the bottom to burn while the top remained completely raw. But the dough cooking would also create some gases, so the jar would have gradually started to repressurize from the gases produced by the cooking dough. As the gases from the dough started to repressurize the jar, that would have allowed heat to transfer through to start cooking the rest of the dough. The result was a perfectly cooked roll that was crispy all around.<br><br>The rubber seal on the lid was a wild card. It had the potential to result in a flat hockey puck if that seal failed too early and the jar repressurized suddenly (which honestly was what I was expecting). By the time the lid&#39;s rubber seal failed, I think that either the dough had already set up into its cooked shape well enough, or it had generated enough of an atmosphere that the change in pressure wasn&#39;t drastic enough, or probably a combination of both, so that it didn&#39;t collapse when the rubber seal failed like the raw one did when its jar was repressurized.", "comment_date": "2019-05-20T04:25:31Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Ty3", "comment_text": "<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LZnIzmbLxv8&amp;t=3m40s\">3:40</a>-<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LZnIzmbLxv8&amp;t=3m50s\">3:50</a> that\u2019s what she said", "comment_date": "2019-05-20T04:17:01Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Mar\u00eda Jos\u00e9", "comment_text": "You should\u2019ve tried with fresh dough, that has a lot more air \ud83e\udd14", "comment_date": "2019-05-20T04:00:09Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "FunkyWunky", "comment_text": "Can u microwave a microwave and then what happened to it", "comment_date": "2019-05-20T03:55:26Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Jared DFTZ", "comment_text": "Instead of high temperature rumbber seal.
