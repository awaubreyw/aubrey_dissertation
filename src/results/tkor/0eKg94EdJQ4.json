There is no consistency in the kinetic energy imparted to the balls, even when you have the same people kick it multiple times, Averaging will not correct for the sheer differences in each persons invidual kicks even when averaged among the same individual. you need a launcher of some kind that will hit each ball with the same amount of force to get any idea because I know from experience that the amount of &quot;bouyency&quot; you will get from helium in that volume is TINY.
