Dioxazine purple is another strong pigment.

I&#39;ve had them since 2017, so some don&#39;t work well, or don&#39;t work at all anymore. My lime green one only worked for a few months, and for some reason it cracked, and burst at school. (It was in a pouch with the other ones when it did, and only stained a little bit of the pouch, but i had to clean all my pens.) I don&#39;t know why, but i kept the lime green pen. I still have it. I guess since it was too expensive to buy, i decided to keep it. I can get it to work sometimes.....", "comment_date": "2019-03-03T23:19:20Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Sian F", "comment_text": "Does...
