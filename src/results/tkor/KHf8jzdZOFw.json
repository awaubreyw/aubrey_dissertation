Loved your video.  Method 2 should actually work better than method 1 but you need to make some changes.  Your iron skillet does not have enough mass for method 2.  Switch to a 14&quot;-16&quot; pan.  Iron is very slow to heat up but also slow to cool... so preheat it for about 30 minutes. (as I cant tell how long things take from the video...  once 25-30 min are over test the pan temp with a drop of avocado oil... if it smokes it must be hot.. around 520F  or sunflower oil 440F... If not need more heat) Then when you throw your steak on the bottom will sear from pan heat and the top will sear from solar heat.  I expect you will get it cooked in half the time as both sides are getting done at once... so watch that meat thermometer.  You may need to remove the pan from the sunlight occasionally to slow down the cooking after the searing is done.

After those I wanted to see how it would react if froze and if it would freeze. Left it in several hours, and it was still super formable. The glowing one was by Zuru called So Squishy in like a dinosaur egg and the other was just an aqua blue by Braini. Think you guys could do something with those or some putties like those including the glowing kind? Like what would it do on dry ice or with liquid nitrogen? the solar board or foundry?
