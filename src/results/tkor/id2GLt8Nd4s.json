You don\u2019t want a thick buildup of oil - that\u2019ll make things stick, and make the oil flake off the way it did. If you can dig your fingernail into the oil, or if it feels at all gummy, you did it wrong - too much oil. <br>2. Cook the egg properly. First, your pan is toooo hot! Put some oil or butter down first. Butter should just slightly sizzle when it hits the pan. If it does more than that, wipe it off, reduce the heat and wait. When the heat is right, drop the butter, quick sizzle, butter melts... Then drop your egg right in the center of the butter. If the butter turns brown, your pan is either too hot or you waited too long to drop your egg. <br>3. Get a real spatula- made of metal. Thin.

Get the water as hot as possible, preferably hot enough to burn you then run the skillet under the water, then gently rub it with something soft like a clean rag, all the stuck on bits of food should be steamed off with this method. If some bits remain reheat the pan and repeat the above steps, then heat one final time and wipe it down with the flax oil, very thin layer, and let it cool on the stove top.

Gotta use oil even if it\u2019s seasoned. Also you never wanna scrub the pan with anything overly abrasive; a chain mail scrubber is great because it won\u2019t score the iron. And last, you NEVER want to pour water into a hot cast iron pan. That can cause it to crack and is potentially really dangerous. What you\u2019d wanna do is pour off the oil while it\u2019s still hot (and potentially reserve it if it\u2019s bacon grease \ud83d\ude0b) and let the pan cool down. Go eat and enjoy your meal while you do so and then once it\u2019s cool, wash it with water and a non-abrasive scrubber. If you have a hard time removing gunk use about a teaspoon of coarse ground salt while scrubbing; that will act as a non-chemical abrasive and works a dream. After that, heat it up on the stove to remove any water and prevent it from rusting, then apply some more oil all over the pan while it\u2019s still hot.

Use solid fat, it sticks better, and get it hotter.  The brown color looks like you&#39;re not completely seasoning it.  It should be black.  You aren&#39;t cooking fat onto the pan, you&#39;re burning it.  Deliberately.  You&#39;re burning all of the hydrogen and oxygen off and leaving a layer of pretty much pure carbon.  That having been said, seasoning is only partially about making the pan non-stick.  It&#39;s mostly about sealing the metal away from oxygen to keep it from rusting.  Cast iron is a misnomer.  It&#39;s actually a really high carbon steel.  (Up to 4-5% carbon.)  Way TOO high to be useful for much, it&#39;s just too brittle at that point, and like all high carbon steel it&#39;s seriously vulnerable to rust.
