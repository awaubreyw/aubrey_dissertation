But there are generally arrows or something pointing to a certain side in the non electronic timer ones that indicates the side you are to use when toasting just one piece of bread.  This is because it needs the airflow in the slot to be restricted to some degree in order for the heat near the bottom to build up enough to trigger the release from that particular side.<br><br>Anyways,  not all of these will work properly on their sides depending on the location of the heat affected device. But if it does, use that side and it should produce some of the crapiest grilled cheese sandwiches you ever had. It&#39;s just one step above putting cheese on toast and microwaving it.
