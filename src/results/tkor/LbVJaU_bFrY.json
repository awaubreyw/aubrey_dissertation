I prefer a double bit when chopping wood for the stove and that brings up a couple thoughts. I once swung down on a gnarled black oak stump with plenty of knots.  The blade skipped off the edge of one knot and then another and buried itself in my left leg about 4 inches above the ankle.  To achieve that, it passed through 2 pairs of 14oz cotton Levi jeans,  two layers of leather in my boot, a cotton &#39;union suit&#39; and two pair of thick linsy-woolsy socks and thunked against the bone.  Luckily, I hadn&#39;t approached the stump with a full swing, looking to find a &#39;set&#39;.   So, grab the leg, pull out the axe and holler for the first aid kit.  The cut was only an inch or so long.  I smeared it with wild honey (unboiled) and wrapped it with gauze and then with a stretch wrap bandage with those cleats.  I was up cutting wood the next day and the next, etc.  After a week I checked and the skin was healed fine so I wrapped it again for another week.  40 years later the scar has faded but it never hurt, didn&#39;t become infected or anything.  What I&#39;m wondering is could you find a way to test my solution of wild honey against some other cures like sugar, sorghum and the like?  I&#39;m figgerin&#39; probably not but thought I&#39;d ask.  Thanx.
