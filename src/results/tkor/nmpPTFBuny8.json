This is why when you heat food sometimes the surface is steaming hot but the rest is cold, this is mainly an issue for dry foods or foods in thicker quantities. When there&#39;s more liquid, the particles vibrate because of the energy which collides with other particles thus causing the transfer of heat, this comes into play with water, which is loosely packed/not dense compared to most common liquids and thus heats up much faster, lets say you poured water into a hole in the middle of the sandcastle, the whole thing would heat up because of the intensity of heat that the water would release, quickly causing surrounding particles in close range or direct contact to heat up faster. This is why adding a small water amounts onto foods or placing a microwave cover over the foods helps dramatically reduce heating times of foods and other objects.<br>Hope this helps with understanding of what was going on ={D", "comment_date": "2018-11-11T01:01:29Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "nemarooo", "comment_text": "is sand technically cold glass powder?", "comment_date": "2018-11-11T01:00:49Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Benjamin Hunter", "comment_text": "What happens when you freeze kinetic sand", "comment_date": "2018-11-11T01:00:22Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "AdamCF", "comment_text": "<b>Hey Nate, Grant, or a YouTube user surfing the comments</b><br>I\u2019ve got an idea.
