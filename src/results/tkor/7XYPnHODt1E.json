I have been using thin superglue (CA) for nearly 20 years in woodworking. CA is a near perfect glue for wood repair. It&#39;s primary negative is that it cannot be stained easily. CA can be stained, but it takes a lot of skill and talent to pull it off successfully. Baking Soda is a strong contender for a quick and easy replacement to the traditional filler. Fine, pure sanding dust from multiple species of wood that can be blended to match the base wood color of your stock. The one thing I have always desired was a cheap, easily colored filler to replace the expensive wood and water based stains I have used in the past. The best part of the video was the molds. The practical application for CA and mold making goes way beyond props. With what you have shown in this video, I can save hundreds on decorative wood hardware. It&#39;s nothing unusual to pay north of $100 for a single corner bracket that resembled cast iron. Usually, I would use such hardware to cover the structural hardware used. The potential to use graphite and aluminum dust is exciting. For the base cost of one bracket I could buy enough supplies to make every piece of decorative hardware I want for my next project. To buy all the pieces I want for the project, I am looking at a base cost of about $1,000.
