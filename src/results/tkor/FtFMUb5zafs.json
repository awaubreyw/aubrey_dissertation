The visual evidence of this is found at <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FtFMUb5zafs&amp;t=9m20s\">9:20</a> to <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FtFMUb5zafs&amp;t=9m30s\">9:30</a> of the video, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FtFMUb5zafs&amp;t=9m28s\">9:28</a>-<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FtFMUb5zafs&amp;t=9m30s\">9:30</a> specifically. Atmosphere speeds up the ratio of acceleration in a gravitational field relevant to weight differential. Vacuum does not negate that ratio, it only diminishes the ratio. Therefore in a vacuum, the higher the drop in a gravitational field, that ratio increases. The science of gravity, mathematics and magnetism do not lie but many believe they do. So your experiment does prove my point.<br>However! As you did not achieve a perfect vacuum, air would sink to the bottom of the tube therefore effectively slowing the descent of the feather towards the very bottom of the tube.
