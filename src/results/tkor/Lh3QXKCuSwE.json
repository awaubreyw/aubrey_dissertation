Actually, there are two proteins you&#39;re trying to cook in the white: ovotransferrin and ovalbumin. The ovalbumin, the most plentiful protein, doesn&#39;t set until 180\u00b0 F. Ovotransferrin, on the other hand, starts to set at about 140\u00b0. It fully sets at 155\u00b0, at which point the white should be fairly uniform instead of the porridge you got, but still soft and gel-like, because the ovalbumin has not yet set. Egg yolks, on the other hand, set around 149-158\u00b0. And time is also a factor: The process of denaturing and entangling proteins actually starts around body temperature, and raising the heat only speeds it up. (Rule of thumb for chemists: a 10\u00b0 C (50\u00b0 F) increase in temperature doubles the reaction rate. It&#39;s only a rule of thumb, mind, and complicated things like proteins can have much more extreme reactions to smaller increases in temperature.) So, overnight might not actually the best idea if you do try this again at a higher temperature.<br><br>This is actually a problem with chicken eggs, too, and the reason that the best way to do it is actually a two-stage process: a very short time in boiling water, shock in ice water, then a longer cook in hot-but-not-boiling water (I don&#39;t remember the actual times, unfortunately). To soft boil an ostrich egg, I&#39;m not actually sure what the best way would be. Maybe sous-vide to cook the yolk, then a brief stint in salted (to raise the boiling temperature) boiling water? Might take some experimenting.<br><br>*You&#39;re not actually cooking sous-vide. You&#39;re just cooking with an immersion circulator. The reason they&#39;re often marketed as &quot;sous-vide cookers&quot; is that the most common household use is sous-vide, but it&#39;s technically not sous-vide unless the food is vacuum-sealed. That&#39;s literally what &quot;sous-vide&quot; means: &quot;under vacuum.&quot; Of course, you don&#39;t actually need to vacuum-seal eggs, because they have shells, but most foods that you&#39;d use an immersion circulator for are much better off sealed away from the water. SPEAKING OF! An idea: You&#39;ve tried a lot of ways to keep avocados/guacamole from going brown, but one thing you haven&#39;t tried yet is using an immersion circulator to hold them at 40\u00b0 C for 1-5 hours to deactivate the enzyme that causes browning. (Alton Brown says 40\u00b0 C; I&#39;ve looked it up before, and the actual temperature is a bit in question; from what I&#39;ve read, 45\u00b0 should be effective, but still low enough not to actually cook anything. The timing is because, according to the one source that actually tested it that thoroughly, 1 hour is enough to keep them from browning for a day, 2-5 is enough to keep them from browning before they go bad, and 6 hours turns them to mush.)", "comment_date": "2020-11-21T00:59:06Z", "likes_count": 87}, {"comment_by": "infinitytec", "comment_text": "Thanks for doing my idea!", "comment_date": "2020-11-21T00:57:57Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Alex Farrell", "comment_text": "An ostrich egg is the largest single cell organism", "comment_date": "2020-11-21T00:55:58Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "My Lazy Lizards \ud83e\udd8e", "comment_text": "Try freeze drying in shell.
