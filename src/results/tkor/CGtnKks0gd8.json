It was snowing and 8 got a bucket of water and put it outside and since I was young I thought that cold water would freeze more quickly........ \ud83d\ude10 well I ended up making a piece of clear ice and I put snow on the other side and it looked really cool!<br>Edit: idk why but when I was watching this I guess tap water doesn\u2019t work well but I\u2019m pretty sure I got tap water. Mayby cuz of the snow I put in the bucket? From the cold tempetures? Was the water I used even Tap water? IDK!

The slower the better as it freezes downwards forcing both impurities and air bubbles down into the thermos.

As the ice forms, the amount of liquid water gets smaller, but the amount of dissolved gasses stays the same. This causes the concentration of the dissolved gasses to increase. Eventually, the remaining liquid water becomes saturated with dissolved gasses and they start precipitating out as bubbles. But in all the cases here, there is a seal of ice preventing the bubbles from escaping so they just get locked into the continually forming ice. In the plastic (and one glass) containers, the water is freezing from all directions so the precipitated bubbles form in the middle. In the cooler, because of the top-down freezing direction, the bubbles were trapped below the clear ice.<br><br>As far as degassing goes, the one that had the best chance was the one in the glass bowl. Water absorbs air very readily, and anyone with an aquarium knows pouring water puts a lot of air into water. But, the one in the glass bowl was still destined to fail simply because the water was absorbing gasses just from the top surface. Had he sealed the top surface there might have been a chance at a successful freeze as long as the vessel maintained integrity (i.e. didn&#39;t shatter).<br><br>I worked on a project where we froze 650 gallons of water in tanks and had to keep the ice as optically clear as possible. We elected to use the top-down method. Because of the 10% volumetric expansion of water to ice we also had to allow for excess water to drain out, so we used a fitting at the bottom of the tank attached to a vertical pipe for overflow. This gave us a port into the bottom of the tank that we used to connect to a circulation and degassing unit on the bottom of the tank. The degasser would work very hard until the first skin of ice across the top, then the amount of gas that could be removed was controlled by how much ice formed. It would take a few months to freeze, but we ended up with a block of ice 3-4 feet thick that you could read a newspaper through.", "comment_date": "2018-10-15T16:47:46Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Yu Wish", "comment_text": "There is a reason why ice rink machines use hot water.", "comment_date": "2018-10-15T16:45:38Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Horned n' Hooved", "comment_text": "Dammit, <b>A SCREW DRIVER IS NOT A CHISEL</b>", "comment_date": "2018-10-15T16:44:23Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "vuk r.", "comment_text": "Do you se play button or I em crazy", "comment_date": "2018-10-15T16:40:46Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Max Melcher", "comment_text": "Try putting it in a freezer while its in a vacuum.", "comment_date": "2018-10-15T16:38:44Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Keshavshyper Likesmtndew", "comment_text": "What happened to the old guy", "comment_date": "2018-10-15T16:37:42Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "heerak sharma", "comment_text": "My way: -<br>Use type 2 non-ionised water <br>Boil it thrice<br>Vaccum it<br>Freeze it overnight", "comment_date": "2018-10-15T16:37:10Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Ryan Russell - ki4rex", "comment_text": "SANDERSON!!!!!!!", "comment_date": "2018-10-15T16:36:05Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Jeremiah Klepatzki", "comment_text": "if you pump air into the bottom of container as it freezes it will freeze clear", "comment_date": "2018-10-15T16:34:49Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "zahin azhari", "comment_text": "What if you put the vacuum chamber with vacuum water in it, into the freezer?

At one point I was interested in how to do this and watched a number of videos.  I have noticed two similar methods that appear to work quite well and you basically did one of them.  They both involve using a cooler to control the direction if freezing.  One is freezing a block like you did and just remove the portion that is not clear at the bottom.  The second way is to suspend some form of ice cube tray or mold in water in the cooler, the container for the ice must be open at the bottom.  Let the ice freeze until it has frozen the depth of your tray or mold, then remove.  If you search YouTube for &quot;clear ice&quot; these methods are used in several of the top results.

That is why glass is clear. As we know from your ammonium nitrate crystal growth videos, the best way to cause crystals is to slowly cool a non moving solution to give crystals time to form. It is the same with the water. The best way to prevent crystals from forming is to keep the liquid water moving across the surface of the freezing water. Professional ice sculptors use a small pump to keep the water moving. Ice makers pump water across the evaporator plate that cools and freezes the ice. That is why your ice chest method made the most clear ice. As the ice was forming it was only able to be cooled from the top, and the rest of the water was too warm for it to freeze, so in essence you were cooling it too fast to form crystals.  But as the rest of the water cooled down to near freezing the crystals were able to grow throughout and that caused the ice to not be clear.<br><br>The second thing is a video idea. I was wondering if you could do a video where you freeze two identical containers of water side by side in a freezer. One would start out as hot water, and one would be cold water. That way, we could finally get video proof of which one freezes first when they are sitting still.<br><br>You guys are awesome. Thank you for all your great work.

Also note some rivers who freeze over clear are also in continuous motion as they freeze over so never perfectly still.  Freezing water in a &#39;still state&#39; makes the water expand and crack as the freezing ice touches the gradually freezing water. same principle as putting an ice cube in water, when it crack your ice cube gets whiter or less clear.
