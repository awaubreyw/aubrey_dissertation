It&#39;s a quick &quot;hack&quot; to make salted egg yolk (quite popular in asian-chinese recipes).<br>But what the hack calls for is to first freeze the egg, break it open and thaw away the white, leaving a nice round semi-hard yolk then only burying it in the salt. The salt and egg yolk should then sit in the refrigerator for just an hour or two (or else it will end up too salty!). Finally, to cook it, I suggest steaming it instead of baking (Tip: rinse the salt off the yolk before steaming!).", "comment_date": "2020-07-02T05:26:44Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Pankaj Jain", "comment_text": "Water a plant with foodcoloring no water", "comment_date": "2020-07-02T05:26:32Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Darkie", "comment_text": "No one going to talk about how Nate just grabbed the yolks", "comment_date": "2020-07-02T05:26:25Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Pankaj Jain", "comment_text": "Microwave a plant", "comment_date": "2020-07-02T05:25:30Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Chris Cook", "comment_text": "The salt eggyokes are an actual cooking technique!

If you need the trays after, just put &#39;em in a zip-top bag once they&#39;re thoroughly frozen. Thaw when needed. (You can do the same with the whites.) Salt eggs are a real thing, but they&#39;re not meant to preserve the eggs <b>as</b> eggs anymore than dill pickles are meant to be the same as cucumbers or kimchi is to be the same as fresh cabbage.<br>-Parsley (and other herbs): In water on the counter is pretty much the best way, but if you don&#39;t have the space, spread them out in a single layer on a length of damp paper towel, roll them all up, and put the roll in a plastic bag in the fridge. It&#39;ll last longer than if you just dump the herbs in the fridge straight from the store.<br>-Pineapple: If you&#39;re not using it yet, just leave it uncut in the fridge. If you&#39;ve already cut it, instead of putting it upside down on a plate, finish cutting it and stick it in a zip-top bag in the freezer.<br>-Squash (those were butternut squash, btw): Best preserved whole, but if  you&#39;ve already cut one open, like you already found, plastic wrap over the cut part will keep them fresh a long time. Cubed, bagged, and frozen, they&#39;ll last for years.<br>So...
