Watching this one tho, there is a faster way to cool the drinks with just ice and salt!  You submerge the can in the ice, pour salt on top to cool the ice more, THEN spin the can in the ice!  Best if you have the can on it&#39;s side when u spin it inside the ice.  The reason of the spin: as the can starts to cool down, the condensation on the can prevents the contents from cooling quickly (like a natural insulator).  By spinning the can, it keeps the condensation in motion from the can thus cooling the contents a lot quicker.
