The gallium aluminum sponge? <br><br>You made aluminum sponge! How does that effect the electrical conductivity of the aluminum? <br><br>Being that it\u2019s now a sponge the surface area must have increased dramatically. Can you use it as a dielectric material or as a collection plate? <br><br>It\u2019s very brittle but could you maybe hold it together using epoxy or some other glue? <br><br>Please comment.", "comment_date": "2018-12-30T06:11:48Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Ian Foreman", "comment_text": "where do you get your gallium?", "comment_date": "2018-12-30T05:51:54Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Ronin", "comment_text": "New face, who dat", "comment_date": "2018-12-30T02:40:43Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Matthias Tietjen", "comment_text": "Whares grant we miss him", "comment_date": "2018-12-30T02:32:28Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "swzy", "comment_text": "she is hot.", "comment_date": "2018-12-30T02:10:30Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "mondrianman", "comment_text": "kinetic sand like metal... kinetic metal?", "comment_date": "2018-12-30T00:11:42Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Life of Souty,PJ,SWEAT", "comment_text": "Pure Gallium is non toxic unless it were too be introduced into a compound, mixing up with different elements or substances.", "comment_date": "2018-12-29T22:34:52Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Cyrus Joshua Zamora", "comment_text": "Howbout liquid iron with some liquid gallium", "comment_date": "2018-12-29T20:54:52Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "John Adriane Yuipco", "comment_text": "Can magnets work inside galium?", "comment_date": "2018-12-29T20:20:58Z", "likes_count": 80}, {"comment_by": "XrQ2", "comment_text": "Aluminum(wow, that is fun to spell)reacts with a lot of things.", "comment_date": "2018-12-29T19:58:02Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "uninteresting person", "comment_text": "That yer discovery wasn\u2019t accidental AT ALL", "comment_date": "2018-12-29T19:25:23Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Angela quintero", "comment_text": "<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EnbKOvdbMq4&amp;t=9m24s\">9:24</a>", "comment_date": "2018-12-29T17:05:36Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Chris", "comment_text": "What was that logo", "comment_date": "2018-12-29T15:51:11Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Lunalie", "comment_text": "Galluminum", "comment_date": "2018-12-29T14:18:10Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "The Sci Fi Guy", "comment_text": "Probably been said before.

Once the steel rod touches the gallium it creates a magnetic field as current flows trough the rod an the blob. As they have the same polarity of magnetic field, Lorentz forces pushes them away from each other. This opens the circuit which causes the Lorentz force to wear off and so it goes on until you pull the rod away from the gallium.
