CO2 is Carbon Dioxide which is what you breath out. Our bodys arnt made to breath in CO2 which is why when you wear a mask you cant breath, get headaches, start feeling claustrophobic even though you arnt, get migraines, etc. Even though YOU might not feel any if these doesnt mean that its NOT effecting your body on the inside. Have you ever went under a blanket, blocked out all the airways, and tried to hide from someone but soon you cant breath? Thats because you are breathing in CO2 and have NO air coming in. The second thing masks dont work AT ALL when you buy them it evens says that it WONT protect you from the virus BECAUSE the virus us sooooooo small that it GOES THROUGH THE MASK! Covid is nothing more than a cold and i should know because IVE HAD IT! Now my third thing i want to say is about the so called vaccine... if we just had covid for a year than how is there already a vaccine? It took longer to get the flu, cold, etc. vaccine but this just took a couple months?! And why are people refusing you stuff if you DONT get the vaccine?!? There is MORE to this than you think. Our country is becoming COMMUNISTIC that is what the DEMOCRATES AND EVEB SOME REPUBLICANS WANT! Trump has stopped this for 4 years but if Biden gets in then nothing is EVER going to be the same.
