I did a final chemistry experiment using glowsticks last year. Getting the glowsticks open is never fun. The reason the blue glowsticks show up clear is that luminol (the chemical that creates the glow) inherently glows a blue colour. So no dye is needed! Typically the clear reactor liquid is hydrogen peroxide.  The reaction is not deadly in small quantities, but shouldn&#39;t be consumed in large amounts. It can cause eye and skin irritation, as well as throat irritation if consumed (so keep it away from your pets). Also, it will dye everything it touches. I destroyed five stirring rods through the course of my experiment just because they were dyed a green-yellow after like three uses. <br>Effectively, the glowstick contains hydrogen peroxide (the clear liquid) and a luminol/Dibutyl phthalate plus a dye. The luminol is kept within a glass container within the glowstick, as seen here. thick plastic exterior is used to allow the glowsticks to bend, but also to protect your hands from the glass breaking inside. Glass is used since it can easily break, unlike, say, a plastic. Dibutyl phthalate is also used to make plastics soft and flexible, so using an internal plastic container may not be as effective.<br>Basically, glowsticks are a ton of fun and if careful (plus adult supervision if you&#39;re a kid), opening them can be an interesting experiment. Luminol is also what&#39;s used on crime scenes, in order to react with blood to make it glow.", "comment_date": "2019-02-28T17:41:39Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Hope Strong", "comment_text": "That hurt my eyes.

The second thing might be that glass naturally has a green color, it&#39;s just hard to see. Stack several panes of glass, look up a picture or stacked glass screen protectors, or look closely at the side of the glass on your mirror. Glass is green. So I think what&#39;s happening is that in the glass, both of the above properties take effect. The liquid sends off a weaker green color, but because glass is green, it reflects all that green sent of right into your eyes. I think that on your glove, because the dye that colors the liquid was so spread thin, the green luminescent color overpowered the fiery orange. Am I wrong?
