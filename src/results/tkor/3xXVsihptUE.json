I use the same crank popcorn pan shown around three minutes in, but mine is magnetic stainless, because I use an induction plate to create the heat.  I put just a tiny bit of olive oil in pot, yes, just a tiny bit works fine, and lots of popcorn. Heat slowly for a while, then crank up the heat upon first crackles. Crank a lot, when done, pour out in a huge container. I use a giant pot. I pour some REAL BUTTER over it and mix in a little bit of popcorn salt. Best popcorn ever, not loaded with artificial oils, low on salt, etc. Costs pennys to make a huge pot full. Many grocery stores sell popcorn in 4 lb bags, and is cheap. I get a 50 lb bag from restaurant supply though.
