It&#39;s the salt formed by mixing baking soda and vinegar, and because the trihydrate form melts below the boiling point of water mixed with it, you can make a supersaturated solution of it by boiling off the water and cooling it with a lid to prevent any more water from evaporating. Then, you just provide a nucleation site by dropping in a sodium acetate crystal (or a tiny bit of baking soda, if it&#39;s your first batch), and it crystallizes quickly. The pure crystals are white and look like ice; between that and the fact that the crystallization is exothermic, you get the name hot ice. (Unfortunately, grocery store vinegar isn&#39;t 100% pure water and acetic acid, so it tends to come out a bit yellowish.) You can also get purer sodium acetate trihydrate by cutting open certain types of heating packs.<br>EDIT: Sorry, if you make it from scratch, your studio will absolutely smell like vinegar.
