Rain in the Summer in America, a lack of tropical cyclone activity, increased thunderstorms and 300 tornadoes in one month. At that point, the El Nino Index showed a reading of almost +1.0 - meaning that the conditions weren&#39;t conducive for off-land activity due to low sea surface ocean heat content and high vertical wind shear. Instead, on-land activity was thriving and severe thunderstorms and destruction wreaked havoc in several areas of the globe. Paired with the Julian-Madden Oscillation, hardly any tropical cyclones formed. Now, the chart has dropped to -0.072 - which is above average for tropical cyclone development - meaning that many tropical cyclones are to be expected. Four tropical waves have formed in the Atlantic Ocean, two near the Caribbean, one in the Central Atlantic, and one in the Eastern Atlantic. Two disturbances are set to form into tropical cyclones near Mexico, and a tropical cyclone is set to smash into Manila next week.
