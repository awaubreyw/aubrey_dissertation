Because the treadmill has no effect on your friend pulling you with the rope. It is literally a force from outside the system. In the airplane scenario, the propeller is the rope. You LITERALLY cannot pull the treadmill fast enough to even ATTEMPT to &quot;keep up&quot; with the plane. The only, and I mean ONLY want the treadmill could affect the plane is if it were being pulled fast enough so that the friction in the wheels of the plane were counteracting the force of the propeller.
