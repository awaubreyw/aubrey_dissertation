feel any pain at all... i only got black from the zink and nothing more... i also made a pice of metal become magnetic no it&#39;s own when i took one end of it and putted it into a small fontainer with water and zink and that i got from the batteries and i did take a 9 volt battery and a some wire and i did put one end of the wire into theliquid and the other at the opposite side of the pice of mettal that was sticking out if the liquid.... and i did it a few times and my pice of mettal became magnetic.....(the most fascinating with my experiment was that when i did conect the 9 volt battery into the liquid so started yellow/ orange /brown bubbles to form around the wire and it keept going for a long while.... also.... when i did pull out the wire from the liquid so realized i that the wire had begun to brake because the bubbles(not because the acid because i had tested leaving a pice of wood in it over a night and nothing had happened to it later)", "comment_date":

The plates inside all batteries need to be kept wet which is   sulfuric acid, the wet substance leaking out.  It&#39;s not normally dark like that.  The dark grey is from the lead plates being broken mixing with the acid.  This battery is a 1.5v.  Pure sulfuric acid has a specific gravity of 1835.  With an industrial forklift battery each cells s.g. should be at 1260- 1300 which would equal 2.10v- 2.14v per cell.  I&#39;d say these batteries have a 1210-1230 s.g.  So yeah, and sulfuric acid is a dry liquid, which means it activates with water or any wet substance.  So if you have a bucket of pure 1800 sulfuric acid and you toss a small cup of water in the bucket.  You&#39;ll get a explosion with acid spraying everywhere and a cloud  of smoke.

Please!!! Could you find out or tell us What would happen in this situation:  : if you had a (baseball sized or about the size of or bigger)hollow copper ball cut in half but made so that you could twist screw on/off both halfs together so the inside and outside of the copper ball had no bumps. Then put a small circular magnet then put it inside the screwed closed copper ball. By holding the copper ball with one hand moving it quickly in a clockwise circular motion fast for a few seconds and then without dropping the copper ball just set the ball down on a flat surface. Would a nail be attracted to the magnet from outside the ball without touching the copper ball? Would a nail attract any faster to the magnet from a set distance outside of the ball after you set it down than if the magnet was the same distance outside of the ball?Would the copper ball start rolling after you set it down?<br>Would the magnet end up floating indefinitely in the center of the ball after shaking around in a circular motion?<br>Would the copper ball implode after shaking it around in the circular motion for too long?", "comment_date": "2018-03-25T07:55:43Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "SerialShitposter", "comment_text": "Maybe try to burn a nuclear batterie Xd",
