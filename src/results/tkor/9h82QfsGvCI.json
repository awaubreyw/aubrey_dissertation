Use lemon varieties which have a larger percentage of essential oil. For the home trials, use Ponderosa lemons. The oil glands in those are so numerous and large that the essential will run down your arm just by peeling them.<br>Oregano, You aren&#39;t using enough material. You&#39;ll need about 5 pounds to get a small amount of visible oil. One of the reasons why it&#39;s pretty expensive.

The reason that the other distiller did not work great, is again plastic, and also directly boiling the substance breaks the molecules down, while in the other distiller, instead of boiling everything, you just use the steam to break open the cells of the plant material and then gets pulled up. Also, the first test was just too small amount of material.  From my experiments, I used eucalyptus leaves. I used about 10 kg of leaves for about 7-8 ml.
