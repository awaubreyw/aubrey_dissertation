We were in a &quot;surgery&quot; when the lights came up, and the actor just paused,   and told us what happened, then we looked around.  He was cutting a body up, that was supposed to be alive, but he was cutting on the side of the table close to him and farthest from the people    going through the house.  But, the blood was all around us, almost none around him.  He noticed    us looking and asked, and we explained arterial flow and pressure, telling him for realism, he needs to cut on the side farthest from him, or put most of the spray around him.  He was shocked, then   of course asked how we knew and we told him and he laughed.
