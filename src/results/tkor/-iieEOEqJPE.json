The radio waves fly around inside the oven but due to frequency and the design of the box there will be standing radio waves, it is therefore necessary to have a rotating disc as the food is on so the whole food gets radio waves. For this experiment you need a mobile phone find a youtube video with a frequency of 1Khz, put the phone on the table and walk around the room and you will experience that the sound disappears and comes again.

Heat is infrared radiation, this is microwave radiation. It heats up food not because it is hot, but because the microwave is set to the exact resonant frequency of a water molecule.

This increased kinetic energy of the water molecules transfers to the other molecules by conduction, and since heat is the kinetic energy of molecules, the food heats up. But anything without water will not heat up.

However all photons from all electromagnetic (EM) waves have certain kinetic energies associated with them. Only once the atoms in an object absorb energy from EM radiation can it be measured as temperature or heat. Its based on collisions with electrons, molecules, etc. So while the microwaves do not bounce heat around, the materials or food being bombarded by the waves do increase in energy, temperature, and heat. (This reminds me of the confusion around E=MC^2 relating to photons. That&#39;s not the full equation, it&#39;s abbreviated. Science Asylum has a great video on this. Light has no mass (so how does M fit into equation? well...) but light DOES have energy, and momentum) So while photons don&#39;t have mass, they do have energy and momentum which allows molecules to increase or decrease in energy. The EM wave nature of the microwaves have oscillating positive + and negative - peaks, they are able to interact and excite polar + - water molecules very easily. This is how food is energized and cooked. The insulation of the confined space helps retain the heat via lack of convection. Once food is out in the open air (as long as the temp is lower than the food&#39;s temp) the hot boundary layer of air surrounded the food can be blown or removed and cool the food. Infrared cookers work well, but do not cook food as evenly, and wouldn&#39;t be the same process or ease as a microwave.", "comment_date": "2020-03-07T07:31:11Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Antonio FWM", "comment_text": "Couldn&#39;t you guess just cut the middle out", "comment_date": "2020-03-07T07:28:11Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Roschlynn Michael D'souza", "comment_text": "Why saw the door off?
