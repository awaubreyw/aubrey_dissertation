So I noticed that you asked if the packaged cookie dough from Ben and Jerry&#39;s is the same as the cookie dough found in their ice cream. According to Delish, they are exactly the same chunks they put in their ice cream. So basically, they are just making more of the same dough to be able to both package it separately and put it in ice cream. And I also found that they are packaging all their other chunks, like the peanut butter cookie dough one that&#39;s in some of their ice creams, the half-baked chunks, chocolate chocolate chip cookie dough, and the vegan version of the chocolate chip cookie dough you guys used in the video that they use in the non-dairy ice cream. So the entire packaged cookie dough chunks line is exactly the same stuff they put in their ice creams. I guess that&#39;s why it&#39;s meant to be kept frozen like how it is with the ice cream, possibly to keep it&#39;s structure, taste, and overall mouth feel. Hope that helps.
