One of my projects was an ocarina, i made a prototype modeled after the Zelda one and a final of my own design,though similar to yours,just more refined. I spent weeks researching various ways to make,tune,and design them. Loved it. Mine is little more elongated,with a bone white glaze (forget what type) and i BELIEVE tuned to key of C (-/+ not sure).
