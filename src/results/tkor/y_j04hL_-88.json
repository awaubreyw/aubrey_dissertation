For starters skunks don&#39;t have a natural fear of pretty much anything, people included, so the kits (baby skunks) took right to living in the house with us.  They would pile up in bed with us, along with the dogs, and everybody got along fine until they were grown enough to fend for themselves, and at that point we let them go into the woods behind our house.
