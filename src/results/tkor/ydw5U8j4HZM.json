Soil contains hundreds of millions of microbes per cubic inch and they play a huge factor in the health of the ecosystem.  Therefore, once the plant had used up all the CO2 within the closed system, none was being produced and it slowly starved.  Although people are mentioning that photo respiration was the reason the plant survived, it is not an efficient enough process to maintain the plant over the course of a week.  Plants do not fulfill the full cycle of cell reps like humans do, and therefore it\u2019s oxygen consuming phase is very inefficient.  The oxygen produced as a product of photosynthesis would have also allowed the plant to carry out photo respiration in the CO2 jar, which obviously did not nurture the plant enough.  The CO2 would have also been heavier than the trace amounts of oxygen in the CO2 jar and sank to the bottom, essentially creating a buffer from the oxygen and suffocating. When you make a closed system terrarium, the plant does not survive because of the initial CO2 deposits, but rather the relationship with the living, oxygen producing microorganisms that live in the soil.

You probably only needed to put a teaspoon of water in the jars, since a lot of it will get recycled since it has no place to go. So you kinda put in too much water from the looks of it. Also, it seems a bit inconsistent the amount of O2 and CO2 going in the sealed jars. Perhaps modifying the lids with a valve and pumping from canisters into it that way will work better and help control it. As for the plants switching to consuming O2 like they do at night, if the grow light is on them all the time with no breaks, then they aren&#39;t likely to switch to O2 breathing as much. The CO2 plant that was out in the open is sort of an example of why I&#39;m not worried about &quot;global warming&quot; with high CO2 levels.

Basically plants still need oxygen. Yes plants use CO2 + Sunlight to make sugars to store the energy of the sun for later and oxygen is a by product here. The important part is that in order to release and harness the energy stored in the sugar they need to use oxygen in the process, creating water and CO2 again. So it&#39;s theoretically a closed loop, but in actuality the plant needs both Water and Oxygen and CO2 to be supplied to it in order to thrive in the long run. Reason being that all the pieces need to come together at the right time, all of them need to be plentiful enough to randomly interact in the chaotic mess that is the life of a cell.<br>It&#39;s a fine tuned process that has been evolved over millions or billions of years so it is especially adapted to deal with the concentrations similar to those found in nature. In nature O2 makes up ~20% of the atmosphere where as CO2 is 410 parts per million or 0.041% so the plant is going to be a lot more sensitive to the oxygen level going to 0 than the CO2. <br>Another way to think about it is taking away the CO2 stops the plant from storing new energy while taking away all the O2 takes away its ability to release any of its stored energy so it doesn&#39;t matter how much more energy it can store with all that CO2 available.<br>Final point here, the marginal amount of CO2 released in the process of the plant breaking down its sugars would be much more significant to the plant because it is used to such low levels. Comparatively the marginal amount of O2 released in photosynthesis is going to seem like nothing when the plant is used to a 20% O2 atmosphere.", "comment_date": "2020-06-12T00:31:59Z", "likes_count": 60}, {"comment_by": "Alyx with a Y", "comment_text": "Plants enjoy nitrogen, which bacteria in the dirt feeds off of oxygen.
