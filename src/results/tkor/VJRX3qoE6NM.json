This video was made three years ago, and I&#39;m currently watching it in 2021 so that means this video was made in 2018. Ironically MAPP gas was discontinued in 2016 but BernzOmatic kept the name for marketing purposes. Anything after 2016 sold by BernzOmatic labeled as MAPP gas is not MAPP gas but simply the same as the blue bottle propane yet being marketed falsely to maintain revenues and the only difference now is that they still sell you the map gas nozzle which just pushes more gas and more air to give you what appeared to be a more powerful Flame. Will it burn hotter; yes because they are increasing the volume of gas and air mixture it is only the nozzle that makes it burn hotter. This is why you pay $50 for a MAPP gas kit. You&#39;re mainly paying for the nozzle but if you run a blue bottle on that same nozzle it&#39;ll have the same chemical and heat signature assuming both bottles are pressurized the same, but it&#39;s actually the same gas \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2642\ufe0f\ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2642\ufe0f\ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2642\ufe0f\ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2642\ufe0f\ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2642\ufe0f", "comment_date": "2021-12-25T05:55:20Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Kristian Dinh", "comment_text": "What happens when there is no gravitation?", "comment_date": "2021-12-23T21:58:09Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "ATS Gaming", "comment_text": "What&#39;s up with the frame at <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VJRX3qoE6NM&amp;t=7m06s\">7:06</a>?", "comment_date": "2021-12-22T20:20:34Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "this channel is cancelled", "comment_text": "<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VJRX3qoE6NM&amp;t=7m06s\">7:06</a> i saw some thing", "comment_date": "2021-12-18T21:46:38Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Josh Loshaw", "comment_text": "use gloves lol", "comment_date": "2021-12-17T01:24:22Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Charles", "comment_text": "You left it in the nitrogen too long the inside cooled", "comment_date": "2021-12-11T04:38:04Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Harold Jackman", "comment_text": "You could try smooth vice jaw covers.", "comment_date": "2021-11-28T01:04:50Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Dariius", "comment_text": "sticker at <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VJRX3qoE6NM&amp;t=7m06s\">7:06</a>", "comment_date": "2021-11-20T22:02:04Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Blazanthrix", "comment_text": "Now try to do it in acetone!", "comment_date": "2021-11-19T01:57:18Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "B", "comment_text": "It\u2019s still hot because of the Leidenfrost effect", "comment_date": "2021-11-11T22:17:33Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "William Rohmeyer", "comment_text": "My hero you saved the butterfly!", "comment_date": "2021-11-02T00:04:55Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Mak_1115", "comment_text": "why are there always some random flashes of TKOR logos in most vids?", "comment_date": "2021-10-30T14:41:01Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Brian Burgess", "comment_text": "Make 1 with no tail, heat and roll it till it drops like a marble", "comment_date": "2021-10-02T13:23:15Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Artificial gamer", "comment_text": "callie:has a torch* a random bug oOOooO something shiny", "comment_date": "2021-08-22T03:34:45Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Kj Dj", "comment_text": "<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VJRX3qoE6NM&amp;t=7m05s\">7:05</a> logo flash", "comment_date": "2021-08-22T03:15:18Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Carlos Playz", "comment_text": "Eyy u should do it", "comment_date": "2021-07-22T14:17:34Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Cinnamon Rick Rolls", "comment_text": "Butterfly: <b>exists</b><br>Callie: no!

Couldn&#39;t you get that droplet forming effect and the quick outer cooling effect without much of a tail behind the drop needed? Or maybe you have someone else hovering there with a pair of scissors or something to try and snip the tail off as short and as soon as possible right as the liquid drop of glass falls between the scissor blades and into the water. What if you just got the end of a glass rod molten and dipped it straight into the water without letting it drop off from the starter glass rod? Would the molten droplet tip still attached to the main glass rod still be as strong as the tip of a Rupert&#39;s drop but without the weak tail, or is there something about actually having to have a molten glass droplet completely separate from the glass rod and cool in the water to obtain all the strength properties of a Rupert&#39;s drop. <br><br>Lastly, another video about these explained that the strength simply comes from the outer surface of the glass coming into contact with cool water first and solidifying well before the center of the drop has had its chance to cool and solidify, so by the time the whole drop has solidified all the way through to the center it has contracted in on itself and therefore solidifies under huge tension which is where it gets its strength. That being said, it sounds like as long as you have molten glass cooling and solidifying faster from outside surface to center, then perhaps the whole droplet shape isn&#39;t even needed and you can just somehow get an entire rod or hunk of glass into a molten state in an oven and then plop that whole thing into some water to end up with any shape other than a droplet with its weak little tail. I&#39;m curious if something about that drop shape with weak skinny tail is necessary for all the strength properties those drops have, or if any shape of glass that&#39;s been cooled under the same conditions would be as strong if not more so by eliminating the weakest aspect of the Rupert&#39;s drops being their hair thin little brittle tails.", "comment_date": "2020-10-28T09:03:09Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Rachael Brady", "comment_text": "I\u2019d like to see what a prince Ruperts drop would do in a vacuum chamber.", "comment_date": "2020-10-10T11:10:46Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Jasiah Emondtfauel", "comment_text": "i seen a blip of the logo\\", "comment_date": "2020-10-02T18:38:49Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Tracy Lang", "comment_text": "Beer bottle and dollar store type glass use a different formula than soft or boro glass.

Water cannot go higher than 212.<br>When the molten glass drops into the water, the heat of the glass cannot be absorbed by the water (can&#39;t go over 212)... the heat is forced out the tail... this creates a &quot;phase shift&quot; of heat energy to pressure and sound to get the &quot;heat energy&quot; out as quickly as possible. The point in the tail... is the phase shifting point. When the glass cools that point is sealed. There is a lack of pressure through the &quot;sound harmonics&quot; of energy. Glass is special in that it will reflect anything not on the other side. The Rupert&#39;s Drop  having phase shifted the heat to pressure and sound, has drastically less than on the outside. The &quot;magic glass&quot; reflects the pressure through the sound harmonic. If you strike the Rupert&#39;s Drop hard enough to make a spark (a phase shift of pressure to light to expend excess kinetic energy)... it will pop the rupert&#39;s drop. If you &quot;unseal&quot; the Phase Shifting point, it will shatter.<br>Now, if I could just make one... but that&#39;s what happens.

Combustion is a chemical reaction, which changes the chemical properties of a substance when reacting with oxygen. As you&#39;ve all seen, every time one of the drops shatters it&#39;s still glass. You could even re-melt the glass powder and recreate the Prince Rupert&#39;s drop over and over again. All the reactions taking place here are purely mechanical, as it&#39;s the release of the tension between the glass molecules that has built up from the rapid cooling and contraction. Also, the reason the liquid nitrogen didn&#39;t work is because it didn&#39;t cool the glass fast enough because of the Leidenfrost effect. The temperature difference between the glass and the liquid nitrogen is so great that it created a gas barrier around the drop, insulating it from the extreme cold.

Get some fibers of various different sizes but aim for as thin and long as you can get it. Test them out to see what is best for what you are using them for and then continue with the best. Then try painting the outside with black, white or silver and compare those with a naked one to see what works the best then try to use it in a project. <br>It would be super awesome for you guys to make a laser beam motion detector circuit! Bonus cool points for doing as many of these other things with it as possible: It would be really cool if you could set it up with the laser bouncing off of tons of little mirrors zig zagging the beam either in a door way, across a hallway or a around a room then you reveled it by turning the lights out and blowing smoke through it (like in a heist movie), set it up so the power cord was USB so you could have it running off of a USB power bank, a computer or a wall outlet, make it at least kind of hidden or just put all the stuff for it into something that looks normal to be plugged into the wall (empty cigar boxes are cheep and look pretty nice as a project box), modify it with a non visible light beam, use some of the home made fiber-optic cables even if they are just to route the light from indicator LEDs or something up to the surface to create a more subtle or hidden display, make it have either an in person alarm or it silently triggers and just counts how many times the beam is broken, and lastly integrate an arduino board or something  connected to bluetooth or wireless internet so that when it triggers you get a text message/email or something.
