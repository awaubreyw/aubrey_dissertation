Unlike the successful bouncy ball that you made, you allowed that to cast in place, if you will, by putting it inside it&#39;s little container and then dropped it in the water to be cured. The ball has lots of room to be compressed and then reform, thus making it bouncy. So, I think if you built a form around the sole of your shoes, filled the form with the beads and then submerged the form in water (possibly best done with water socks so that it won&#39;t be miserable wearing shoes that soaked up a bunch of water) it may have a lot better result as the new bouncy sole should now have room to compress and reform.

rubber on the shoe would have to be proportional to the person\u2019s body weight, meaning it\u2019d have to be very thick, and on top of that the size would have to be strong enough that it can hit the ground without dispersing all that energy into the ground. In other words, you\u2019d need so much force to counterbalance the transference of the energy so that what would be left would be enough to propel the person into the air. Essentially, with gravity the way it is on earth and the weight of the average person, this is kind of impossible.
