In the ice, that quickness to have heat removed would mean that the heat is applied to the ice quicker as well. If the material is slow at shedding off its heat, when exposed to ice, it would make the ice melt more slowly, then turn to steam more slowly as well...where as a material that can shed its heat quickly will melt the ice quicker, then turn it to steam quicker, causing more pressure in the ice, causing it to explode.", "comment_date": "2018-07-04T03:47:31Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "avech", "comment_text": "I don&#39;t mean this personally, but I would like to see something new?

thermal conductivity therefore letting more surface of the ice touch the molten metal and maybe making a seal increasing the presure and blowing the block of ice, i mean probably im wrong but what do

Al and Pb being more reactive than hydrogen displace get oxidised, reducing the H+ in water to hydrogen gas. The gas produced has to go somewhere so it pushes though the ice, and hence breaking it. Cu is less reactive than hydrogen (and brass, majorly consisting of Cu) doesn&#39;t produce hydrogen gas and thus no explosion.(Though brass reacts a little differently as it also contains Zn which is more reactive than hydrogen thus there is some production of gas but the increase in pressure(due to the increased volume) is not enough to break the ice and the gas just exits from the top spurting metal with it. So if you want to see explosions you should use the metals higher in the rectivity series.

My guess is the rapid temperature change is so sudden that the metal starts to expand near instantly. A similar thing happens (only thousands of years slower) when water gets in the cracks of a rock and freezes. The rock eventually gets pushed apart from the inside. They&#39;ve had cases with rocks practically exploding from this same phenomenon. If the block of ice were the right shape, it theoretically wouldn&#39;t shatter. The structural integrity might be so strong (let&#39;s say in a sphere), that the ice would end up becoming a mold. This might explain why the bottom piece of ice is a diamond. The weak points in the ice must have either been directly in between the corners, or on the corners themselves. This concept of expansion and contraction might help explain why it works best with metal that has a low melting point. With brass and copper, it takes more to cool them down. They&#39;re so hot that the ice can&#39;t exchange energy fast enough to make them rapidly expand. While with lead and aluminium, the low temperatures allows less energy to induce a change.
