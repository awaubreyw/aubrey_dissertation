As for the glove it took a long time to let it dry so you lost your patience, decided it was enough of a glove even though it was still a thin layer of partially dried glue, and immediately decided to peel it off, which was not very climactic due to it not being fully dry.

Fill empty balloons with a little LQ and tie it, then let the LQ evaporate and fill the balloon, and light it.<br>5.
