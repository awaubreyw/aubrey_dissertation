Molecular oxygen (as what is in the air) is a diatomic molecule. It is naturally O2 already. So you only need one molecule of O2 (plus a single atom of carbon from somewhere) to make a single molecule of CO2. No net change in the number of molecules of air-based oxygen to carbon dioxide. Unfortunately, the math goes against you for oxygen plus parts of the parifin to water. For every one O2 moledule combining with the hydrogen in the parafin you get two molecules of H2O, so you have a net doubling of molecules. Now, as the gaseous H2O condenses on the inside of the glass, there is one possible way of lowering the volume of gas inside the glass, pulling the water in. (I&#39;m not sure how quickly that happens though.) My suspicion is most of the suction is as a result of the hot gasses (particularly the gasses hot enough to glow in the flame) cooling and trying to reduce in volume to lower the pressure inside the glass which then allows the column of air above the experiment to push the water up into the glass.", "comment_date": "2019-12-28T21:22:39Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Jason Paeth", "comment_text": "Cause it burns the oxygen out cause a vacuum", "comment_date": "2019-12-28T21:14:56Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Nidhal Sormali", "comment_text": "Anything can burn once it gets thin enough", "comment_date": "2019-12-28T21:14:30Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Nidhal Sormali", "comment_text": "XD <br>PLOP<br>HAA<br>hhahaahah GLORIOUS<br>PLOP HAHA", "comment_date": "2019-12-28T21:11:51Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Kevin Hatley", "comment_text": "What happens if you do it with waterproof matches", "comment_date": "2019-12-28T21:05:25Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Kevin Hatley", "comment_text": "Lol <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5aOyxysY9DI&amp;t=3m20s\">3:20</a> my guy said \u201cwater atoms\u201d", "comment_date": "2019-12-28T21:03:50Z", "likes_count": 4}, {"comment_by": "Nidhal Sormali", "comment_text": "&#39;Cos its hot?
