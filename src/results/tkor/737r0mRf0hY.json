LOL I think the dislikes are people who wanted a million dollar diamond made from a briquette and peanut butter. LOL.. if you can afford a platinum plate and a high temperature kiln with rotisserie base... it is possible to grow real precious crystals from the correct chemical compositions. The pressure required for diamonds is the difficult hurdle... my above reference was for entertainment purposes. I think thats a decent temperature and with the right pressure it might only take half the time... geology is a lot like baking. You can not cut corners... time, temperature and ingredients (with pressure as a modifier).

There can be trace elements in diamonds that change the color/opacity of the crystal, but these impurities aren&#39;t anywhere near the 5mol% encountered in coal. It&#39;s also important to note that diamonds are really only valuable to most people as a large single crystal, something that&#39;s more difficult to make than diamond &quot;dust&quot;. Graphite, however, is also a pure phase of carbon, so it can be directly converted into diamond. Anyway,  to convert the coal into diamond the lowest pressure you would need to have would be at about 1000MPa , and a temperature of just over 4000K.

It can be done synthetically but not in a microwave and not with charcoal briquettes. When I say a whole lot of pressure I mean like the weight of a mountain and when I say high heat I mean nearly volcanic heat from beneath the earth&#39;s crust. I&#39;m not exactly sure what they use in Laboratories or factories probably some kind of giant pneumatic piston or hydraulic press to compress coal. I would imagine you still need quite a bit of heat though. There&#39;s a company that can take some of the carbon that people are made of after they pass on and get cremated they can take some of the carbon mix it with a another element to create a colored diamond that was literally created from your body.

I have seen a video few years ago with a guy showing a method for making diamonds by taking a string, soaking it in (i think) olive oil, making few turns around a graphite (from the mechanical pencil thing) and then taking a plat and a mug. He put the plate upside down and put the mug on top of it - that it created a seal (kinda) and put the graphite with the string in between the mug and the plate for about 30 to 60 minutes. (the mug broke) The idea is, that the string will help concentrate the power in one spot. The diamond was not visible, but he said that a jewelry store guy told him that there is a ~18 karat diamond.
