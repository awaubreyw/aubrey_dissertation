Although not truly smokeless nitrocellulose does emit only a tiny fraction of the smoke of traditional black powder, burns much faster, leaves less residue, and the residue it does leave isn&#39;t inherently corrosive like black powder residue. As a result nearly every firearm designed after 1886 has been completely dependant on nitrocellulose to function. Putting black powder in a gun designed for smokeless will gunk up the gun within a relatively small number of shots, cause it not to cycle if any energy from the shot is used to move internal parts (like in semi-automatic or fully-automatic guns), and begin corroding the gun if it isn&#39;t cleaned promptly. On the other hand putting smokeless in a gun designed for black powder can blow up the gun.", "comment_date": "2021-08-13T08:06:26Z", "likes_count": 3}, {"comment_by": "Rob Seabrook", "comment_text": "why would you NOT do this outdoors rather than indoors....you have soot all over your house now....ingenious! lol  but nice demonstration and video!", "comment_date": "2021-08-11T17:47:39Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "INDRA REX TROY", "comment_text": "COOL", "comment_date": "2021-08-10T20:23:12Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Nice Guy 57", "comment_text": "Rest in peace my friend , even if you were not alive , thank you for teaching us this method", "comment_date": "2021-08-10T09:54:27Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Fakedream2", "comment_text": "Tnt in real life", "comment_date": "2021-08-10T08:06:45Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "DrRSPMD2010", "comment_text": "Thanks for that additional knowledge in Chemistry.

They are produced with &quot;flash powder&quot;, which is more powerful and more sensitive(and therefore more dangerous), depending on which &#39;recipe&#39; you choose, AND the consistency the final product. I&#39;ve never made any myself, but as a chemistry buff, I&#39;ve read about it.*</b><br><br>The most common recipe for flash powder used in commercial firecrackers, is aluminum powder and potassium chlorate. However, the use of potassium chlorate as an oxidizer, is potentially more dangerous, because it creates a more friction sensitive flash powder than can be set off accidentally, by stirring the powder too hard! But it can be made in a safer, less sensitive form, by using the &#39;perchlorate&#39; form of the chemical, instead of chlorate. So a mixture of aluminum powder and potassium perchlorate is supposed to be significantly safer. <br><br>Also, producing it in the form of extremely fine powder is NOT the most efficient and most powerful form, because it burns slower, which is the opposite of what you want in an effective flash powder. The mixture will burn faster and more efficiently when the particles are larger, with air spaces in between the particles. Some people go as far as to produce specifically shaped particles.<br><br>But there are other recipes for flash powder, that utilize magnesium powder in place of powdered aluminum, and sodium nitrate in place of potassium perchlorate. Depending on final particle size and shape, as well as chemical ratio, you can end up with a flash powder that burns so fast and efficiently, that it practically detonates in open air, even when not confined inside a closed airtight container!

Simple BP packs together and therefore loses surface area and burns &quot;slowly&quot; unless compressed, it is used in pyrotechnics, rockets and some traditional black powder muzzle loaders but will not burn as fast as gunpowder when uncompressed.

My idea was that some of the impurities might desolve in water (with water coined as the universal solvent) and afterwards I could strain the sulfur from the hot water solution and in theory any of the said impurities that are soluble in water would be gone. I did this whole process before making a batch of black powder and did notice that after burning, there was less residue left behind as the reaction was more complete than that of using only 90% pure sulfur.", "comment_date": "2017-05-02T11:05:33Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "alibobcat", "comment_text": "mix black powder and gummy and once it solidifies see if it would burn", "comment_date": "2017-05-02T11:02:19Z", "likes_count": 2}, {"comment_by": "JMS Motorsport", "comment_text": "It&#39;s not HyDROscopic, it&#39;s HyGROscopic.

A ball mill really is the secrete to producing amazing black powder. <br>- Use &#39;willow&#39; or &#39;balsa&#39; wood charcoal instead of the paint sticks, you will get an increased burn rate.

This gives you a VERY simple fuse with a burn rate around 1 inch per second. To speed it up, you can then wrap the black match in loose paper or even scotch/painter&#39;s tape, giving you quick match which burns very very rapidly (feet per second). I prefer paper because you can rip a foot or two of paper off, giving you 10-20 seconds of predictible slow burn, followed by a rapid combustion to whatever you&#39;ve put your fuse into.<br><br>Might be worth trying.

There are several other processes black powder generally goes under to increase the burn rate, the most significant being mixing it with water.  It seems counter-intuitive, but saturating the powder with water and then drying drastically increases the burn rate as it dissolves the potassium nitrate salts (the oxidizer in this mixture) into the water and then, as it&#39;s dried, the potassium nitrate is deposited in all the microscopic pores in the charcoal particles.", "comment_date": "2017-05-01T16:39:55Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Agent 007", "comment_text": "pleas show us how make bottle rockets with it  ;)", "comment_date": "2017-05-01T16:39:48Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "scott lund", "comment_text": "Great and perfect video!
