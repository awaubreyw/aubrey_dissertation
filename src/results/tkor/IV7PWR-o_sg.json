Its only the final electron recipient at the end of the electron transport chain. You can\u2019t make your ATP without it, but the energy does not actually come from O2.  In short term, I could see O2 giving a slight boost to your energy just by making your metabolism more efficient. Don\u2019t forget the placebo effect for improving your performance. Long term use of extra O2 could potentially cause anemia. Your bodies red blood cell (RBC) production is regulated by hypoxia (lack of O2 to the tissue, kidneys in particular) low O2 in the blood in the kidneys produces eurithropoeitin (EPO). Which promotes more RBC production. Long term super high O2 could potentially hinder this and cause a reduction in RBC production. However I think that would require almost constant 100% O2 content. Also, your RBCs can only hold so much O2. So once your RBCs absorb 100% saturation, in hailing more O2 will have no effect except maybe the diffused O2 content in the plasma. Which does not deliver the O2 to the tissues. Also remember O2 produces free radicals called superoxide.
