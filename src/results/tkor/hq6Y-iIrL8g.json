Freeze drying the mentos caused them to crack. In turn added more surface area on the mentos. Causing a slightly more violent reaction. Basically like dropping more of the mentos in to the soda. It would be a cool experiment to see if you got the same result if you just cracked the mentos and put them to the test.
