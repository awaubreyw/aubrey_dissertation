The AFO was designed to put out small semi-enclosed spaces (dumpster, cabinet...).

A CO2 extinguisher works by eliminating oxygen and replacing it with carbon dioxide. You could do the same thing with just about any non-oxidizing gas (nitrogen, halon), but carbon dioxide is inexpensive and easy to store. A dry powder extinguisher can handle all four types of fires: combustible solids like wood or paper, combustible liquids like gasoline or grease, electrical, and metal fires. The idea behind a dry chemical fire extinguisher is to blanket the fuel with an inert solid (similar to dirt or sand). A dry chemical extinguisher sprays a very fine powder of sodium bicarbonate (baking soda), potassium bicarbonate (nearly identical to baking soda), or monoammonium phosphate. These solids coat the fuel and smother the fire. A CO2 extinguisher is much more efficient but more bulky. It&#39;s recognizable from the huge &quot;horn&quot; nozzle and no pressure gauge.
