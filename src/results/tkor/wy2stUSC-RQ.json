However, exposure to gallium halide complexes can result in acute toxicity. The Ga3+-ion of soluble gallium salts tends to form the insoluble hydroxide when injected in large doses; precipitation of this hydroxide resulted in\u00a0nephrotoxicity in animals. In lower doses, soluble gallium is tolerated well and does not accumulate as a poison, instead being excreted mostly through urine. Excretion of gallium occurs in two phases: the first phase has a\u00a0biological half-life\u00a0of 1 hour, while the second has a biological half-life of 25 hours.<br><br>And gallium has to be labeled as corrosive....", "comment_date": "2020-06-07T16:15:58Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "FCFA Titan", "comment_text": "So, I&#39;d you guys didnt know the only way to get thermite on a civilian level is the packaging.
