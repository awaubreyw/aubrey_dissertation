It can be seen without a camera, granted you have the correct setup. I stumbled upon this when I started playing guitar some 10 or so years ago. I have a 59Hz monitor which is usually the only lightsource when I engage in late-night guitar studying. Granted you have a small enough incongruence between your light frequency and string frequency, you&#39;ll perceive this incongruence manifesting visually as a stepwise phase-shift of the string vibration at each strobe cycle, which ultimately means that you can fine tune this to visualize a wave with a frequency equal to said incongruence. For a 59Hz monitor like mine, I could visuallize the string as a ~1.5Hz standing wave by playing a Bb2(~116.5Hz). The ruler is just not precise enough and the lighting needs to be very controlled(Preferably the only lightsource present).<br><br>Edit: It is very similar in fact to the wave interference which causes you to hear two notes &quot;beat&quot; against eachother when you&#39;re tuning.", "comment_date": "2020-03-31T10:55:55Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Ajitesh Dhillon", "comment_text": "try weak hcl for the bone in vinegar experiment instead of vinegar", "comment_date": "2020-03-31T07:37:42Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Bryce Brown", "comment_text": "im a big fan. if anyone here is in there houses because the corona give a like.", "comment_date": "2020-03-30T17:53:45Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Krisha Nicole", "comment_text": "Can u do 10000 degreese knive vs liquid nitrogen", "comment_date": "2020-03-30T11:39:27Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Alien \u30b7", "comment_text": "The first experiment did not work ;-; did you use oxygen or helium in the balloon.", "comment_date": "2020-03-30T02:33:21Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Canada\u2019s wonderland!
