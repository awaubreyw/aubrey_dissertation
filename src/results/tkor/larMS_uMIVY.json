Even chocolate has too many solids and will always burn or have a burnt taste in you try to spin it. Only solid, clearish sugars or sugar candies will spin into floss. And when you are making a big, pretty cloud of cotton candy on a cone or stick, don&#39;t wait for it to accumulate on the sides of the catch bowl; take it as it slings out from the spinner, holding your stick above the spinner, twisting the hole time; it will come off in one band or floss of melted sugar and you spin the stick (cone) in your hand like you were winding twine on a spool, like the streetcart vendor videos. And yeah, the top part of the catch bowl totally gets in the way; Take it off. Its just hot sugar. There you go, the perfect cotton candy.
