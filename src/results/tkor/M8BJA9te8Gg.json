I love root beer but it is hard to find here unless you want to pay $2.50 a can versus 50c or less for a can of coke - they are imported A&amp;W root beer cans.  There is sarsparilla which is similar to root beer but it&#39;s not the same.  I also like Dr Pepper which did come out here in Australia for a while but it wasn&#39;t popular enough to stay on the market (it&#39;s a cultural taste I guess) - that too is available now for around $2 to $2.50 a can for the imported Dr Pepper cans.  With both of the imported Dr Pepper and rootbeer, the ones made in Mexico taste better than the ones made in the USA because the Mexican ones use cane sugar for sweetening while the US ones use high fructose corn syrup - I don&#39;t know if that is just a side effect of growing up consuming cane sugar over HFCS but it is what it is.<br><br>When I was a kid we used to get &quot;spiders&quot; which is actually different to a float (I was looking to see if I was right about red creaming soda being the traditional soda used here and found that out instead).  A float has the scooped ice cream added to the soda (or the scooped icecream in the bottom of the cup with the soda poured on) while a spider has the icecream mashed with some flavouring syrup in a cup and then the soda poured over the top.  We always had them made with red creaming soda but apparently people were also making them with lemonade like Sprite afaik, they could have also used lemonade similar to traditional lemonade but I can&#39;t find anything that matches what I am referring to that is sold in the USA beyond Rondo which left the market quite a while ago.", "comment_date": "2020-09-11T02:37:15Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Starla Townsend", "comment_text": "I used to work at a restaurant and we had this person come in who always made us make their float in the blender you put like four scoops of ice cream and a whole can of whatever soda they wanted and blended it till it was smooth like a milkshake", "comment_date": "2020-09-11T02:27:14Z", "likes_count": 4}, {"comment_by": "Starla Townsend", "comment_text": "Use all different kinds of sodas and all different flavors of ice cream and sorbet", "comment_date": "2020-09-11T02:25:07Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Anna Sassin", "comment_text": "idea which soda pop makes the best floats try them all, orange cream ginger ale etc", "comment_date": "2020-09-11T01:54:52Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Savana Gomez", "comment_text": "Wait y\u2019all don\u2019t like the foam?", "comment_date": "2020-09-11T01:39:09Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Kaue Ferraz", "comment_text": "Here in Brazil, we dont have Root Beer, actually I never heard before.

Both the warm and the cold drinks (given the short space of time) will melt roughly equal amounts of ice cream. In fact the temperature difference is less important for this process vs the movement of the liquid over the ice cream, creating convection. This is why cold running water melts ice quicker than stagnant hot water.
