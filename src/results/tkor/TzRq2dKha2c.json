Get two matches, point both heads together. Wrap tin foil or we would use the bit that you pull out of a cigarette packet wrapped tightly around the match heads (paper side in). Heat up the foil and you get a mini rocket. There is another trick that you need three matches, a matchbox and a flame. You put two matches in the matchbox (like a vice) pointing outwards and make a triangle with the match heads touching. Place the third match head on top/between the other two sticking out and it resting on the ground/table. Light the match heads and wait to see what happens. Is it YouTube friendly who knows.
