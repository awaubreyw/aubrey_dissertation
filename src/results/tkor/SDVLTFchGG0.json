I don&#39;t think the scent was the deciding factor there. Cats like spots that just fit right to their body size, as it makes them feel saver. If it is a cat-sized opening, the largest thing that could attack them is a cat-sized creature. It is also more comfortable, as they can snuggle against the walls. Of course materials and shape play a factor as well, as having a scratchable surface helps the cat making it part of their territory.<br><br>To the catnip i can only say that I don&#39;t think it is worth to buy it at all. Not every cat likes it and not all so called &#39;catnip&#39; attracts cats. I have several species of cat mint in my garden and not a single cat cares about it. They may chew on one of their leaves, but the bamboo on the other side of the garden gets much much more such action. It seems to be more about the shape and structure of the leaves rather than its smell and maybe even taste. Anything that is grass-shaped and has no poison will do just fine. (Larger leaves are prefered, though) I used just wheat most of the time, as you can buy germinable wheat in almost every super market. Half a kilo will last you 1-2 years easily - and costs less than one pot of ready to eat cat grass.<br><br>My cats like to chew on strand maths/raffia maths (essentially bound together hay in structure and smell) as well. I think most cats would do. Dried catnip leaves/stems and blossoms don&#39;t get too much attention in comparison.<br>As for the socks: Just put anything into it. It doesn&#39;t need to be catnip. It only has to be interesting. I never met a cat that liked them stuffed with plain fabric/tuff, but crumbled up paper, leaves or - yet again - hay will make for interesting sounds and texture. It is of course much cheaper as well.", "comment_date": "2020-06-21T01:59:12Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Rasceney Joseph", "comment_text": "If you search kittens versus invisible wall you see that somebody already did that", "comment_date": "2020-06-21T00:46:52Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Lil mosey still woke up like the man", "comment_text": "Ew why would u use avatar in that edit", "comment_date": "2020-06-20T23:52:42Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Kazi Wolf", "comment_text": "My cats favorite place to hide toys was under the fridge", "comment_date": "2020-06-20T22:39:55Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "camodeath69 252", "comment_text": "Nate was Yoda in <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDVLTFchGG0&amp;t=12m40s\">12:40</a>", "comment_date": "2020-06-20T18:57:15Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "The Diamond Hunter", "comment_text": "If you do that the cat may think it&#39;s a snake and no longer trust it there", "comment_date": "2020-06-20T16:33:37Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "cat barry", "comment_text": "That fur babys", "comment_date": "2020-06-20T16:28:39Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "The Diamond Hunter", "comment_text": "I&#39;m so sad the cats look so cute but my mom and brother is allergic", "comment_date": "2020-06-20T16:22:58Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "jennifer morton", "comment_text": "Lol pot cat in box and pot hols in it then wen you have cat in not duo tape on it", "comment_date": "2020-06-20T14:41:09Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "M.A.C", "comment_text": "I have the same looking cat on the thumb nail", "comment_date": "2020-06-20T13:39:21Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Heartstopper addition", "comment_text": "cat&#39;s  smell catnip better than humans", "comment_date": "2020-06-20T10:57:11Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Lyssi", "comment_text": "Did anyone notice that their names are Jack and Sally?

The project involves attaching the device to the top of a scratching post and the motor spins the laser while its angled (you want a somewhat slow spin maybe grind off a couple gears to make it move in intervals) but the concept is that doing this you leave it in the middle of a room and the cats chase the laser while you are gone and because of something I noticed with my own cats is that when they start to play they want to sharpen their claws. This would be a somewhat time consuming project depending on how far you want to take it (IE integrating a battery compartment into the cat tree so you don&#39;t have wires showing and such) but the end result would keep kittens pretty well interested. I would say use no less than 2 gears with 1 gear having a section 1/3 or 1/4 of the way ground/filed smooth (preferably the drive gear on the motor) because that allows the system not to seize up.
