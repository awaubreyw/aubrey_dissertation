Because light reflects and refracts, you are not able to see the light as it travels through the laminar stream of water until it reaches the end, just like with fiber. However, if what you want is something that looks cool but isn&#39;t necessarily laminar, but close, you could wire up a small vibrating motor from a game controller to the outside of container at the output end. You could turn this on and off to create interesting effects. Multiple motors in different configurations would provide different effects on the water and light.

It works by taking pigments that, when hit by a white light, absorb all of the wavelengths in the color spectrum except for a range that is attributed to a particular color. When you blend different pigments, it further restricts the range to form different colors, &quot;subtracting&quot; the wavelengths. Eventually, adding enough different pigments will result in either brown (all pigments mixed together) or black (all wavelengths absorbed).<br><br>Additive color is the opposite - instead of &quot;subtracting&quot; wavelengths, you are adding them together in the form of light sources that emit specific wavelengths. The primary colors are red, green, and blue, and when added together they make the secondary colors cyan (green and blue), magenta (red and blue) and yellow (red and green). If you keep blending colors, you eventually end up with white, which is all the wavelengths added together.
