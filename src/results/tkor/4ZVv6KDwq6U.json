And also it can destroy cotton, paper, wood and I think it can even destroy hair. A while ago I tried it with dead stink bugs and it worked beatifully. All of them vaporized! (well they did not actually vaporize, but the sulfuric acid turned them into carbon and the hydrogen peroxide oxidized the carbon to CO2 wich is a gas.)<br>4.
