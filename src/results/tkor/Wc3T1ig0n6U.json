Black locust seeds don&#39;t respond too well to cold stratification, so instead I use scarification (yes, that&#39;s also a real word and appropriate for the process I use). Basically I put the seeds in a tea strainer, and quickly pour over the seeds and through the strainer a cup of boiling water. Sounds extreme, but it works. The seeds are only in contact with the boiling water for a second or two, then it flows away through the holes in the strainer. The seeds get a thermal shock which awakes them and makes them sprout. I then put them in a moist folded paper towel in a bag and leave them on the counter for a couple weeks. It&#39;s actually best to not completely close the bag as the seeds need air to sprout. Then I plant them directly outside. Many sprouted seeds will die when you plant them outside instead of in a pot first, but those that survive will grow strong trees.", "comment_date": "2017-05-11T23:02:23Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Svet_", "comment_text": "theres an interesting way to grow an avocado tree by piercing the seed with tooth picks and placing half of it in a glass of water, you will be able to watch it sprout and see the roots as they go into the glass of water", "comment_date": "2017-05-11T23:01:44Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Michael Nugent", "comment_text": "I heard you had to have a rabbit eat the apple seed and then once it poops it out it will grow.", "comment_date": "2017-05-11T23:00:24Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "DR_aine", "comment_text": "i already have an apple tree", "comment_date": "2017-05-11T23:00:07Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Uioman Cannot", "comment_text": "I actually did this years ago, and the tree is currently about 2m tall, not producing, might be sterile. started off with three seeds.", "comment_date": "2017-05-11T23:00:07Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Chris Aguirre", "comment_text": "my parents told me not to eat apple seeds because they had cyanide.", "comment_date": "2017-05-11T22:59:48Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Tom wood works", "comment_text": "You should make a molten glass figit spiner", "comment_date": "2017-05-11T22:58:05Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "James Alexander", "comment_text": "can you do this with bananas, rubarb, or even coconuts", "comment_date": "2017-05-11T22:56:46Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Dinamush", "comment_text": "Don&#39;t apple seeds have sugar cyanide?", "comment_date": "2017-05-11T22:51:34Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "DETROITREDNECK DETROITREDNECK", "comment_text": "I have an experiment for you I have seen the trees that grow apples on one branch Peaches on another Branch pears on another branch I would like to see you make your own multi fruit fruit tree", "comment_date": "2017-05-11T22:51:26Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Camo Flag", "comment_text": "How to plant an apple tree <br>Put the apple in the ground<br>I think", "comment_date": "2017-05-11T22:51:14Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Jayke Leblanc", "comment_text": "Umm u planted the seeds upside down and u didnt have to put those in the fridge", "comment_date": "2017-05-11T22:50:59Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Senjutsu666", "comment_text": "hey grant i was wondering what would happen if you put molten metal in liquid nitrogen", "comment_date": "2017-05-11T22:50:31Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "MarzBarz", "comment_text": "if you come early enough it is said he likes your comment.", "comment_date": "2017-05-11T22:49:09Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Bret ashworth", "comment_text": "How long does it take to grow an apple tree", "comment_date": "2017-05-11T22:46:34Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Janinho897", "comment_text": "So in 3 weeks,  the Honey Hickory Sauce is still at the same level on the same spot, the water level and position of the gallon hasn&#39;t changed, and there are still two identical cans on the top shelf in your fridge? interesting...", "comment_date": "2017-05-11T22:45:27Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Velocity Art", "comment_text": "3 weeks later and he leveled up and got new armor", "comment_date": "2017-05-11T22:45:16Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Cyborg Beaver_1639", "comment_text": "I thought you were in nyc", "comment_date": "2017-05-11T22:43:31Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Atomic Videos", "comment_text": "( \u0361\u00b0 \u035c\u0296 \u0361\u00b0) ( \u0361\u2299 \u035c\u0296 \u0361\u2299) ( \u0361\u25c9 \u035c\u0296 \u0361\u25c9)", "comment_date": "2017-05-11T22:42:47Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Joe Seabert", "comment_text": "I grew an avocado tree from the pit.
