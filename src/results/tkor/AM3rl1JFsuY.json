You take a rock (I&#39;ve done it with carbonates, but you can do it with silicates if you can find the right acid), cut it, and polish one side. Then you dip that polished side VERY BREIFLY into a solvent. Once the solvent is dry, you dip the rock into acetone, then press it onto an acetate sheet. You hold it there for a second, then remove the rock (pulling it straight up). What&#39;s left behind, if you do it right, is an impression of the rock, showing all the grains, fossils, etc. <br><br>The great thing about this method is that once you etch the rock, you can make as many acetate peals as you want. And since they each show what&#39;s in the rock, you can ship these acetate peals to various researchers. I&#39;ve used them to count the number of brachiopods in a chunk of limestone, for example--a few of us counted the number in the same rock, to test various counting methods.

So first you make the putty and put it in one half and in the middle of it you put something hard in it like wood that way it has a core. then put putty in the other half and clamp both halves together very hard so both halves bond together before the 2 halves set/cure so you don&#39;t have 2 half swords that has wood in one.
