The whole idea of an electric arc is the higher the voltage the more easily it is for electrons to jump from one atom to another and the further away those atoms can be. Eventually, it becomes high enough for the electrons to jump about the various atoms in the air which are usually too far apart for electricity to flow through. If you pull all the air out, as in a vacuum, there are no (or few) atoms for the electrons to form a path across and so they would have to bridge the gap in a single jump purely from one atom of one carbon rod to an atom from the other. While theoretically possible, it would take an absurd amount of voltage to achieve.<br><br>What is interesting to me is the potential of melting things in a vacuum or a non-oxygenated atmosphere (replacing the air with nitrogen or an inert gas). Without oxygen, metals wouldn&#39;t oxidize when heated and would cause them to behave differently than standard furnaces, which is one major benefit of an arc furnace (normal furnaces require oxygen to function and produce CO2 anyway).<br><br>One thing to be careful of is the fact that without air at all, the carbon rods will heat up quite quickly and take a lot longer to cool down. Removing air forces the heat to dissipate purely through radiation instead of conduction through the air or a replacement gas. Though graphite is one of the better materials at radiating heat in a vacuum, it&#39;s still significantly less than what it can do in atmosphere.", "comment_date": "2018-10-22T01:37:55Z", "likes_count": 163}, {"comment_by": "Liam Van Straten", "comment_text": "Can you make homemade silicone gloves with Proto putty", "comment_date": "2018-10-22T01:37:46Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "C.V PADMAVATHI", "comment_text": "Next time why don&#39;t you try up with  inert gas", "comment_date": "2018-10-22T01:37:35Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Cari Draney", "comment_text": "Well...plasma is acetylene and oxygen ....can you put the acetylene and oxygen in a vacuume chamber", "comment_date": "2018-10-22T01:37:33Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "robert moneygold", "comment_text": "try automotive high temp rtv", "comment_date": "2018-10-22T01:36:36Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Christopher Manfredo", "comment_text": "Egg in a vacuum chamber?", "comment_date": "2018-10-22T01:36:28Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "MKUltraGaming69", "comment_text": "More grant more grant more grant", "comment_date": "2018-10-22T01:36:04Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "mitch marcarthy", "comment_text": "I want to see the yellow and black sunglasses", "comment_date": "2018-10-22T01:36:02Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Vincent Belletti", "comment_text": "What would happen if u use the ark and melt ninja ooz", "comment_date": "2018-10-22T01:35:59Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "BIG MAMA", "comment_text": "It needs air to ark", "comment_date": "2018-10-22T01:35:43Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Austin Chopra", "comment_text": "You should fill it with noble gases like He, Ne, Ar, Kr, Xe, and Rn.
