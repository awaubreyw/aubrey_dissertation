If a fluid is defined as a substance that takes the form of it&#39;s container, and a solid is defined as a rigid material such as a wooden block, then Silly Putty fits the definition of a fluid, a very viscous fluid. Silly Putty also happens to keeps it&#39;s form under high impact, thus allowing it to bounce off of hard surfaces. So since it maintains a certain level of rigidity during high impact moments such that a normal fluid would conform to the impacted surface itself, Silly Putty could be observed as a Non-Newtonian Fluid.
