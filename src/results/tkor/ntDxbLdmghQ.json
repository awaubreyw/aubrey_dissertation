Direct heat from the flame (in controlled, small amounts) doesn&#39;t typically effect any sugar based candy that much, it only heats the trapped air inside the liquid. <br><br>This method works best for small or shallow molds for the best distribution of heat. But when using a very large one, such as this mold of Nate&#39;s foot, you can do this in layers!
