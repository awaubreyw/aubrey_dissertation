The rubber stopper idea is great, but flawed.   Drilling a hole in the lid makes an irregular opening with microdents and metal burrs; this will impact the seal at a microscopic level.   Also, the jar within a jar evacuation method doesn&#39;t allow for 100% of air to be removed.   The moment you release the suction, the pressure balance is restored to all areas of the vacuum chamber.   This floods all areas simultaneously; instantly.   A negligible, yet problematic amount of air will still manage to flow into the inner jar just before the inner seal sets.

You are basically trying to solve the question of whether food will last longer canned or fresh. The obvious answer is yes it will last longer canned that&#39;s why people can stuff.

You might as well have finished the process and just boiled it and done normal canning. I don&#39;t understand why this video is necessary. So sorry to be a hater or whatever.

The answer is not likely that the seals broke or air got in, but more so the microbes and fungus living on the food created their own atmosphere. Many microbial decomposers are anaerobic which means they don\u2019t need oxygen and occasionally don\u2019t even need air to survive. Where you left the unsterile food exposed to unsterile objects, decomposers contaminated the samples and went to work regardless of air pressure. The lack of pressure may have disturbed some of them, but by the looks of it, mostly cells with cell walls survived because the cell wall helps to regulate the cells size and shape, resisting the vacuum chamber. As they broke down the saccharides (sugars) in the food, they created oxygen and carbon dioxide. Also, there could be traces of other gases depending such as nitrogen depending on what parts the microbes and fungus decomposed and what types of metabolisms they use to respire. Water could also be created through respiration which is why the bread may have been even more moist than it was to begin with. <br><br>To sum it up, organisms that don\u2019t require air or an atmosphere contaminated your samples and created their own atmosphere within a vacuum chamber.", "comment_date": "2018-10-01T06:58:22Z", "likes_count": 678}, {"comment_by": "Caleb Champion", "comment_text": "Drilling holes in the lids of mason jars \ud83d\ude15\ud83d\ude15\ud83d\ude14\ud83d\ude22\ud83d\ude22\ud83d\ude15\ud83d\ude15\ud83d\ude12\ud83d\ude12\ud83d\ude12\ud83d\ude11\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02.
