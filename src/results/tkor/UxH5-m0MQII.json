For some reason I think that if the phone book were slowly pulled apart, rather than in a sudden burst, this would give the air enough time to slip into the cracks. I think the fine, thin paper helps a lot in the test as well. As you turn pages in a phone book, they almost seem like they are statically attracted to each other, and as one page falls from spine to edge onto another, I think this and the nature of the paper (such as surface texture) effectively eliminates air on it&#39;s own.<br><br>I just never see Post-it Notes behave that way. In fact, they usually end of fraying out if you toss them into a bookbag, and seem to return to form in the same way a spring does. And if I&#39;m correct, the &quot;vacuums&quot; between the pages would degrade over time as air creeped in. Though I think if you had a decent vice, clamp, or press it would be able to &quot;touch-up&quot; the vacuums, perhaps even stronger than before.
