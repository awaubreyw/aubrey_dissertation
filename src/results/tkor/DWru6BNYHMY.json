I would take a 50lb sack of pure cain sugar. fill sugar into a 22qt food grade round container with about a teaspoon of floss. blend well and pour a scoop into floss machine. turn on heater then motor and allow cotton candy to build up along the walls of the bowl. repeat filling floss into machine while on when needed. You should have a net lining the inside bowl to help catch the cotton candy and plus half of the melted sugar for easier clean up. I noticed no leather straps on the spindle head, it helps keep the mix from flying everywhere when pouring into machine while running (you\u2019ll still get overspray but not the whole amount when pouring). adjust speed when floss starts to fluff up along the walls. Allow a generous amount of cotton candy to build up, stick cone into the inner section, twist and pull up at the same time. I would just grab twist &amp; then stuff into bag. I usually have two floss machines running at the same time to mix flavors while packing. <br><br>looking forwards to some more experimental cotton candy videos\ud83d\udc4d\ud83c\udffb", "comment_date": "2019-11-02T20:10:32Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "BRENTGAMEZ", "comment_text": "I don&#39;t know if you&#39;ve done it yet but what about butterscotch?", "comment_date": "2019-11-02T20:10:03Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "SirNoobington", "comment_text": "can you turn baby powder into cotton candy?", "comment_date": "2019-11-02T20:10:01Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Isla", "comment_text": "What happens when you put multiple colors of candy floss, cause it melts, will it combine or stay separate", "comment_date": "2019-11-02T20:09:57Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Mitchell Posey", "comment_text": "The cotton candy machine that I have says to use sugar free hard candies and that seems to work better, worth a shot next time you go down this road get some sugar free!", "comment_date": "2019-11-02T20:09:56Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Chuck Mayes", "comment_text": "Ingredients.
