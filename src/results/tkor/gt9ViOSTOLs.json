I have a suggestion for if you try this again. I was an avid archer through my childhood so i would love to see another go at this project...<br>First, when making the longbow, as you put the sticks together in the tube, try to see if you can fit them together so the tips aren&#39;t point-to-point, but with tips interlocking. Hard to figure out how to describe it but envision the points, 2 here and 2 there.... Instead of spear tips touching, have them interlocking like one flat on the side and the other group standing on the side.... That way you should get a box formation in there... This should help keep maximum rigidity in the epicenter of the bow. If possible, put it all together like that and wrap once in electrical tape and then insert into plastic sleeve. Also, more rigidity means more force exerted when firing. Another thing you can try is resins... Like pine resin. Something to keep it more solid as one single piece structurally, rather than having it like the video shows which allows for some potential force to be spread out rather than all concentrated to the middle of the bow. Bow physics dictates that the spot you fire from should be the spot where all that potential energy meets, gathers. I could probably explain it better if i didn&#39;t have to think of how to type it out, but i hope this helps. Feel free to ask me if you have questions, i will do my best to provide proper answers.
