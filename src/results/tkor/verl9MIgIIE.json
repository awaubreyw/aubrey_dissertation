First, the slime uses baking soda as a coagulate in reaction with the glue and borax. Borax being an acid, and Baking Soda being a base, they neutralize each other. Adding the slime and acid mix, you break that bond and dissolve the slime into... basically sludge. Second, glue is typically made from organic matter. Acid rapidly dissolves organics, which means the mixture cannot coagulate and turn into slime. You would need an acid paste. I can see using powdered sulfuric acid as a replacement for the baking soda, but I don&#39;t know of any acidic glues to replace the more neutral glue you are using here.", "comment_date": "2020-06-18T16:37:24Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Samuel Castillo", "comment_text": "What about citric acid", "comment_date": "2020-06-13T14:16:05Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "yingxia wei", "comment_text": "TKOR: What happens if we make acid sli-<br>YouTube: AgE-rEsTrIcTeD", "comment_date": "2020-06-06T01:09:18Z", "likes_count": 2}, {"comment_by": "Kairi Medeiros", "comment_text": "I haven\u2019t made slime since 4 AM on a Tuesday night", "comment_date": "2020-06-05T23:43:30Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Christopher Kelley", "comment_text": "Only 1/3?

The neutralization of acid release a lot of energy, just look at the reactions and the enthalpy chart, much more than the ionization caused by the dilution.<br>pH only works with diluted acid and bases, with concentration below 1 mol/L. In concentrated acid, the concept don&#39;t work and pH stripes don&#39;t read it. With the sulfuric acid, the color change happens because of the oxidation of organic matter cause by acid, and the pH stripes and food coloring are basically organic compounds.<br>This oxidation also happens to glue, which is a 4-8 % PVA, that&#39;s why the slime don&#39;t form.", "comment_date": "2018-12-16T03:33:34Z", "likes_count": 175}, {"comment_by": "Pam Offutt", "comment_text": "That&#39;s definitely Flubber!", "comment_date": "2018-12-16T03:30:44Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Eric Teachworth", "comment_text": "Where&#39;s grant?", "comment_date": "2018-12-16T03:30:03Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "ashlyn whitehead", "comment_text": "You should extract DNA from bananas and strawberrys (i did this in my biomed class)...but to other experiment to see what it does under extreme heat and cold.", "comment_date": "2018-12-16T03:28:43Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Bill Cypher", "comment_text": "When termite meets slime!", "comment_date": "2018-12-16T03:25:39Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "junkratsgf", "comment_text": "Did anyone notice how red Nate\u2019s eye was??!", "comment_date": "2018-12-16T03:24:44Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Kaiden H", "comment_text": "Powderize acid and other things like gasoline and hand-sanitizer", "comment_date": "2018-12-16T03:24:33Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Mia Wyx", "comment_text": "try to make a skate board with a scooters handle bars", "comment_date": "2018-12-16T03:22:38Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Jan Hansen", "comment_text": "You could try ask a chemist how to do it, like NileRed or NurdRage", "comment_date": "2018-12-16T03:18:53Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Alfie Aboagye", "comment_text": "try liquid nitrogen slime", "comment_date": "2018-12-16T03:18:43Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "London", "comment_text": "Acid in the vacuum chamber", "comment_date": "2018-12-16T03:14:37Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Katrina Reid", "comment_text": "Superglue slime", "comment_date": "2018-12-16T03:14:34Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Avery :0", "comment_text": "why do you only make jiggly slime you never make normal slime", "comment_date": "2018-12-16T03:14:22Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Blarg", "comment_text": "Can you powderize vanilla extract?", "comment_date": "2018-12-16T03:07:43Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Neumanator", "comment_text": "Make edible slime", "comment_date": "2018-12-16T02:59:57Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Itsamiyah", "comment_text": "Can you do dry ice and acid<br>and how will it reacts\ud83e\udd70\ud83d\ude0f\ud83e\udd14.", "comment_date": "2018-12-16T02:59:36Z", "likes_count": 38}, {"comment_by": "Jashaun Garrett", "comment_text": "See what happens when you freeze acid with liquid nitrogen or dry ice", "comment_date": "2018-12-16T02:57:10Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "AMD GAMING", "comment_text": "Put ice cream in the dehydrator", "comment_date": "2018-12-16T02:56:07Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Atma Seepersad", "comment_text": "Light acid on fire", "comment_date": "2018-12-16T02:53:26Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "David play's & animates", "comment_text": "can tharapedic putty repel a bullet", "comment_date": "2018-12-16T02:50:57Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Ryan Brown", "comment_text": "Can you please try making foam like matress foam or glowing metel", "comment_date": "2018-12-16T02:47:53Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Minecraft asmr Skertskert", "comment_text": "Try soaking orbeez in acid.", "comment_date": "2018-12-16T02:45:33Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "John Kuhn", "comment_text": "What was the <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=verl9MIgIIE&amp;t=2m46s\">2:46</a> slide about", "comment_date": "2018-12-16T02:45:02Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Matthew Robinson", "comment_text": "Put acid in the vacuum chamber and arc furnace", "comment_date": "2018-12-16T02:44:12Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Diana Dolan", "comment_text": "Mlat a glow sick", "comment_date": "2018-12-16T02:39:35Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Dessellee Stanford", "comment_text": "Dehydrate/powderize tomato sauce and try to reconstitute it", "comment_date": "2018-12-16T02:38:58Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Finaldash", "comment_text": "Make a slime volcano", "comment_date": "2018-12-16T02:38:24Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "rakhi mondal", "comment_text": "When Nate was talking of the sponsor I literally thought that he was going to be sleeping with Callie on that mattress", "comment_date": "2018-12-16T02:34:42Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Ben Korpella", "comment_text": "Does anyone else ship Nate &amp;

He then poured a third the red cabbage water into one of the beakers and it changed colour. Then, he poured another third of the cabbage water into the other beaker, and it changed another colour.

He then poured a third the red cabbage water into one of the beakers and it changed colour. Then, he poured another third of the cabbage water into the other beaker, and it changed another colour. He then poured both beakers into a bigger beaker and compared the colour to the remaining third of cabbage water. I thought it was a neat demonstration of PH values and acids and bases and such.
