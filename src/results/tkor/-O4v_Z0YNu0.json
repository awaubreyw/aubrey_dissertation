that feed into 8 inch round duct work approx 4 feet long. incorporate your diy sand blaster (2x) and airbrush (2x) for your salt and butter. use the same vortex positioning you do in the foundry. it will salt and butter the popcorn in a contained space while dropping it out into a kiddie pool. for bonus points build an auto-reload system for the air poppers. tweak quantities as you see fit to maximize salt/butter coverage and overall cubic feet per hour output. the kiddie pool was a cute proof of concept but it&#39;s time to do it for real.", "comment_date": "2019-05-31T04:24:30Z",
