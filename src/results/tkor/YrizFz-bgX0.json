The whole problem is the agitation causes the CO2 to separate from the water which pressurizes the can, and tapping is just going to agitate it more (if possibly only negligibly more). What you need to do is to get the CO2 to redissolve into the water, which is why waiting 30 seconds worked the best for them. You can also put the drink in the fridge/freezer, as cold water dissolves CO2 much more readily than warm water so the CO2 will redissolve faster and more reliably. (This is why warm drinks are the most explosive as the water can&#39;t dissolve as much of the CO2 and it separates much more easily.)<br><br>Alternatively, you could also open the can slowly so the pressure gets gradually released rather than all at once.

Most times nearly all of it is mixed in the Drink so you have a nice fuzzy drink. Shaking it however agitates the CO2 in the drink so it forms actual CO2 wich mixes with the air. Because you can dissolve much more CO2 in the liquid, there is a pressure built up, wich in turn creates your &quot;exploding cans&quot;. <br>The Paint shaker could actually shake it so much tho, that the liquid kind of dissolves the CO2 right as it forms, so its not as violent as you might think. A Single Shake could however create a small low pressure point in wich the gases are very likely to pop into, as there is more space they can occupy and therefore create a really high pressure wich dissolves rather quickly. Its the same reason a beer foams so violently when you give it a hit with another bottle from the top.<br>Now to the tapping: the only thing that the tapping really does is just removing some of the bubbles wich could grab liquid when the can is opened. These bubbles need time to form however. Just take a glass of coke for example you will only see tiny bubbles at first and 10 minutes later they are much larger although only very few of them still exist in your glass. So Tapping after shaking it so violently is basicly doing nothing.
