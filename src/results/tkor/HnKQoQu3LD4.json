I\u2019ve worked for a soap company for many years, and the products you used are very familiar to me. Couple of tips:<br>1) I noticed you\u2019ve used HE (high efficiency) detergent for the video (presumably, this is what the instructions for the washer said). HE detergent has much lower levels of suds (# of bubbles/volume) than non-HE. Also, powder detergent tends to have higher suds than liquids. And finally, suds need proper water temperatures to activate. If you re-run the experiment with non-HE powder detergent (and hot water), you\u2019ll have that machine bursting with bubbles. Should make for some great visuals.<br>2) most front-loader washing machines have heating elements, most top loaders do not. If you cannot hook it up to a hot water supply, get a front-loader. <br>3) the \u201cwaxy\u201d feeling you get from over-dosing with fabric softener are the remnants of the surfactants built into the softener formula. The surfactants essentially coat the fibers of the fabrics and this is what makes these fabrics feel \u201csoft\u201d. It also makes them less absorbent. There are various ways to get rid of these surfactants (heat, oxygen, acid, acrid smoke). <br><br>Love your show!", "comment_date": "2020-06-05T00:52:26Z", "likes_count": 143}, {"comment_by": "Aspen A", "comment_text": "You should try putting Dawn soap in the machine!!!", "comment_date": "2020-06-05T00:51:26Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Aspen A", "comment_text": "<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnKQoQu3LD4&amp;t=9m38s\">9:38</a> Who else laughed when they saw Callies face in the reflection of the play button", "comment_date": "2020-06-05T00:51:11Z", "likes_count": 13}, {"comment_by": "Dude Wassup?", "comment_text": "Dish soap next!", "comment_date": "2020-06-05T00:50:20Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Alyssa :p", "comment_text": "Video idea: what happens when you put trainers in a dryer", "comment_date": "2020-06-05T00:49:24Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Kai Kelemen", "comment_text": "LET HER MAKE SOUP", "comment_date": "2020-06-05T00:48:56Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "VampiricUnicorn", "comment_text": "If you had wanted a more sudsy load you should have used a front faced washer. ;) Now there&#39;s a washer that you have to make sure to put the correct amount in!", "comment_date": "2020-06-05T00:48:44Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "SmoKeYJoE024", "comment_text": "Try a non-HE washer.
