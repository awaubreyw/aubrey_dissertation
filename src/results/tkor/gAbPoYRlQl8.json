I&#39;ve worked as a roadie and audio engineer for years and have tried to teach this to all my support people. It&#39;s tough to teach but once they get it, they get it. One thing to keep in mind, however, is you must throw the cable out holding the end of the cable where you started your wrap. If you throw out from the opposite end, you&#39;ll put an overhead knot for every loop you made into your cable. Not fun. Plan your throw. I almost always throw from the &quot;talent&quot; end to my audio or power source. Hence when I wrap, i start by unplugging then walking to the talent side and wrapping the cable in from the talent side. Make sense? This works great with round cables. Flat cables like a flat extension cord, however, are better served with a slip knot wrap aka electrician&#39;s wrap.
