This is true for multiple reasons.<br>1) Even at 32,000 lumens, the total radiant output of the flashlight is only 47 watts (One lumen = 1/683 watts of visible light power). \u00a0<br>2) Most of the beam was not hitting the lego figure (less than 10%).<br>3) Virtually all of the photons were reflected.  Below is the explanation.<br><br>In a shiny metal, photons (light) interact with both 1) the valance electrons of the metal lattice and 2) the electrons in the conduction band.  Some of the photons impacting the metal surface are absorbed by the electrons in the conduction band.  At visible light frequencies, conduction band electrons collide with the lattice electrons at a rate faster than the frequency of the visible light photons.  This (conduction band electron-valence band electron interaction frequency &gt; visible light frequency) works to prevent the absorbed energy in the conductive band from being passed on to the valence electrons in the metal lattice.  Because the waves do not penetrate deeply not many of the conduction electrons see the incoming wave and not that much overall energy is absorbed.  Most of the energy is reflected by the first few layers of metal atoms in the lattice with a spectrum that depends on the scattering properties of these particular metals atoms. <br><br>In your experiment, the gallium was close to the light, and as the flashlight grew hot, some of the air near the flashlight was heated as well (through simple conduction).  This air, heated by conduction, passed some of that heat on to the lego figure, again by conduction.  Thus, it was primarily conduction and not radiant heat that melted the figure.  So yes, the flashlight did melt the gallium figure, but through its by-product of heat.  The photons (light) did not play a significant role.<br><br>A simple way to confirm the above would be to find the isothermal zones around the flashlight, while it is on.  A thermal camera or a quick-read thermometer can do this easily.  Then, place two figures in the same isothermal region - one directly in the beam the light and one outside of the beam of light.  Simple observation would detect whether the energy from the photons has any meaningful effect.<br><br>Thanks.
