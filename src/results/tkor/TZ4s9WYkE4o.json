Basically using some spinach leaves, under a uv/ ultraviolet light, the normal spinach leaf is a bit purple but when you rip the spinach leaf into pieces and pouring 95% lab alcohol into a glass with the leaves causes a different result. When the room is dark, with the uv light, the leaf and alcohol in the glass is usually dark green but under light it is BRIGHT red and is incredibly amazing. This happens because the alcohol dissolves most of the things in the cell leaving the chlorophyll exposed. The electrons excite and raise in rings and they drop down again. The red color is literally electrons falling in energy levels.
