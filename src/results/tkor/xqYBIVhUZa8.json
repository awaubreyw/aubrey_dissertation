Do you have any suggestions for how to keep fleas away? I live in a house that has a flea problem and my legs/feet are terrible looking because of how many times I&#39;ve been bitten. If you don&#39;t have any ideas for how to keep them away, maybe something that can help my legs heal? Like something homemade?  I am really low on funds, and anything helps. Thanks, and your cake looks AMAZING. \ud83d\ude0a", "comment_date": "2019-05-16T06:38:36Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Keke Love", "comment_text": "Can u guys do the ramen life hack things", "comment_date": "2019-05-16T06:36:19Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Anmol Bhatia", "comment_text": "Who knew before this video that Titanium is edible???", "comment_date": "2019-05-16T06:35:09Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Rohit Tondare", "comment_text": "Can you Freeze Dry Anti-freeze?", "comment_date": "2019-05-16T06:20:34Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "LAZAR BANANA", "comment_text": "You did the same video twice but with a different name", "comment_date": "2019-05-16T06:17:57Z", "likes_count": 4}, {"comment_by": "DJHYPES Salazar", "comment_text": "Can u make an egg glow different colors", "comment_date": "2019-05-16T05:56:55Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "A.S.N Ethen", "comment_text": "Make a rainbow one!", "comment_date": "2019-05-16T05:55:19Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "emeral\u2019s Kandy", "comment_text": "What happens when you mix dry ice and copper together?", "comment_date": "2019-05-16T05:49:55Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Brendan Ansell", "comment_text": "You should put a CD in a micro wave", "comment_date": "2019-05-16T05:42:42Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Composer Muda", "comment_text": "24 on trending malaysia", "comment_date": "2019-05-16T05:31:58Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Josh Ofiana", "comment_text": "What would happen if you dehydrated used coffee grounds and would you be able to use them again and if so how strong will the coffee be?", "comment_date": "2019-05-16T05:26:51Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "CyborgBee", "comment_text": "What is the best way to clean stained cookie sheets?", "comment_date": "2019-05-16T05:14:40Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Trey Antonelle", "comment_text": "You should test and see if aluminum cans actually have a plastic lining in them", "comment_date": "2019-05-16T05:12:45Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Offensive Vin", "comment_text": "should of added different colors", "comment_date": "2019-05-16T04:58:50Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "ii_Sythix", "comment_text": "Try to make things levitate lol or something levitate.", "comment_date": "2019-05-16T04:56:41Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Joshua Watts", "comment_text": "Lol they got this from Rosanna Pansino\ud83d\ude02", "comment_date": "2019-05-16T04:55:46Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Anirudh", "comment_text": "Make a fidget spinner spin with magnets", "comment_date": "2019-05-16T04:55:40Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Namrepus Gamer", "comment_text": "Did nobody else see this at <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xqYBIVhUZa8&amp;t=10m40s\">10:40</a>?
