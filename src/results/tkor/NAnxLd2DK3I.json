Direct heat from the flame (in controlled, small amounts) doesn&#39;t typically effect any sugar based candy that much, it only heats the trapped air inside the liquid. <br><br>This method works best for small or shallow molds for the best distribution of heat. But when using a very large one, such as this mold of Callie&#39;s hand, you can do this in layers! Simply pour the candy in, heat it, and repeat. <br><br>Like this comment if you think TKOR should do more candy casting, and if you want them to see it!", "comment_date": "2020-07-05T00:16:01Z", "likes_count": 56}, {"comment_by": "InfernoGaming", "comment_text": "Try an ear", "comment_date": "2020-07-03T23:47:41Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Kelly B.", "comment_text": "This is the one time you can pull someones finger without worrying!
