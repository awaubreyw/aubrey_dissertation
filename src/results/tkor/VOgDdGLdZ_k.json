I only say that because you might want to avoid tasting the material that splattered onto the stove top.  Maybe recommend that those spatters are just cleaned up and disposed of?  Probably being a bit of an old lady worry wart, and overly cautious, but if the spattered material was heated by the flame directly, you could have some nitrite formed (and you really don&#39;t need very much at all to make you sick...)

I then used this same pot and added one 1/4 cup of distilled water again and 10 teaspoons of powdered sugar. Reduced the water with a 15 min simmer and put the pot in the freezer for 15 min. Again I heated the mixture but added 2 teaspoons of 90% iso alc on the stove and evaporated the rest of the water. Before the solution caramelized and turned brown I removed it from the heat and gave it a swish and let it sit. The end result was the smoothest plastic like white rocket fuel I have ever made. It has the appearance of elmers glue and burns very vigorously. I attempted to recreate it this morning without pre crystalizing the Kno3 and without the freezer time in the middle and ended up with a shaved ice type fuel. Still burns well but isn&#39;t like the elmers glue style from before.
