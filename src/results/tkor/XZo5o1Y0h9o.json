Having such a large cavity in the foundry will really be a challenge for those little burners to heat up, and you will find that it takes way longer to get up to temperature compared to the smaller foundry. Also, when you put larger items in there to heat up, they will absorb a lot of the heat which means it will require a LOT more heat to keep temperature up in there while in use. <br><br>I would have double lined the Kao Wool to take up some of that space, and would definitely double up the burners, with two more burners placed above the existing burners about halfway up the trash can.   Would actually make for a cool video; remaking the gas burners two high with a bracket holding one above the other. Two sets of those, one on either side and you&#39;ll be set.<br>Also, place a hard fire brick on the bottom to lift the crucible up so that it is receiving heat from underneath.
