It makes sense since on camera the water looks a bit brownish and when it was boiling it was more of a foam ontop instead of the bubble boiling kind and that  is since lignin is the material in wood that gives wood it&#39;s strength and brown color and it foams up under heat. That would explain why at the lower temperatures the water had a hard time heating up, but it did when you introduced the foundery since it can go up to higher temperatures and therefore liquidizing the lignin and heating the water and since the two other tests couldn&#39;t reach as high temperatures it didn&#39;t heat the lignin and all the heat that was in the water was probaly from surface heat on the water line and mabye the glue melting and heating it up aswell, very similar to what the lignin did.", "comment_date": "2019-01-01T23:35:56Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "niki123489", "comment_text": "Happy New Year!
