You could be floating in the air. Your body&#39;s capacitance makes a &quot;virtual ground,&quot; and it&#39;s why you will get shocked by only touching the hot. Animals that hang out on power lines have a much smaller capacitance. They also usually don&#39;t sweat through their skin. When it comes to DC, this capacitance means nothing.
