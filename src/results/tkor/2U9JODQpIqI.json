Microns are small \r<br>\u2013 1 millionth of a meter. Pollen particles are often 10 microns or bigger. Bacteria are often about 1 \r<br>micron. COVID19 has a diameter of approximately 60\u2013140 nm or 0.06 to 1.4 microns.\r<br>While particulate matter or organisms of any size \r<br>can cause adverse effects to our health, particles below \r<br>2.5 microns in size are especially dangerous. These are \r<br>small enough to be absorbed directly into \r<br>our bloodstream and enter our lungs, heart, and brains. \r<br>Regular HEPA filters are fantastic at capturing particles \r<br>under 0.3 microns. \r<br>In fact, smaller particles, like 0.01-micron \r<br>particles are even easier to capture than 0.3 micron \r<br>particles. It seems counterintuitive that 0.3 micron \r<br>particles would be harder to capture than 0.01 microns \r<br>(30 times smaller). That is because we think of filters \r<br>like a net, thinking that if a particle is smaller than the \r<br>holes in the net, it gets through. That is how HEPA filters \r<br>or N95 masks work for particles &gt;0.3 microns. These \r<br>particles either cannot fit through, either because they are \r<br>bigger than the filter hole size, or their inertia causes \r<br>them to hit the filter fibers (impaction &amp; interception). \r<br>Particles under 0.3 microns have so little mass the actually bounce around like pinballs when they \r<br>hit gas molecules, so they move in random zigzag patterns. This is known as Brownian Motion.\r<br>Here\u2019s why that 0.3 micron number \r<br>comes up all the time. The weirdness of \r<br>Brownian motion happens under 0.3 microns. \r<br>The more easily understandable filtering occurs\r<br>above 0.3 microns. But where those two \r<br>processes overlap is the weak spot. Particles at \r<br>0.3 microns lie in between the two, and that \r<br>makes them the hardest particle size to capture. \r<br>Researchers call this the most penetrating \r<br>particle size (MPPS). The theory of 0.3 microns \r<br>being hardest to capture works for fiber filters of \r<br>all types, including N95 masks.\r<br>Scientists from NASA have tested the particle capturing efficiency of filters and found that 0.3 \r<br>microns is the lowest point. Another piece of evidence comes from hospitals and airplanes, many ofwhich use HEPAs to capture viruses as the \u201cremoval efficiency is generally greater for particles both \r<br>larger and smaller\u201d than 0.3 microns.\r<br>3M, one of the manufacturers or N95 masks, issued a Technical Data Bulletin in February 2020, \r<br>addressing these same concerns. Key highlights include these statements: \u201c. . . it is generally thought that \r<br>airborne viruses are normally attached to other particles and rarely exist as naked organisms. Inhalation of \r<br>these bioaerosols may be reduced by wearing respirators. The US Centers for Disease Control and \r<br>Prevention (CDC), the World Health Organization (WHO), and many national health authorities have \r<br>made numerous recommendations for respirator use where they believed the potential for the spread of \r<br>disease through the airborne route exists. Considerations for selection and use of respirators to help \r<br>reduce exposure to bioaerosols include: \r<br>\u2022 Filtration \r<br>\u2022 Microorganism survival on the filter \r<br>\u2022 Potential reaerosolization of the bioaerosol \r<br>\u2022 Reuse of the respirator \r<br>\u2022 Fit and the assigned protection factor of the respirator\u201d\r<br>A number of questions have been raised regarding the use of respirators against biological agents. \r<br>The primary question is whether or not particulate respirators can filter small particles such as fungal \r<br>spores (2 to 5 \u03bcm), bacteria (0.3 to 10 \u03bcm), or viruses (0.02 to 0.3 \u03bcm). As noted previously, biological \r<br>organisms may be carried on other particles including dust, blood, saliva, etc.\u201d The following graph \r<br>illustrates this concept.\r<br>Figure 1. Averaged Filtration Efficiency for Six N95 Respirators* (on the left), and Size Distribution of Droplet Nuclei from a Sneeze (on the \r<br>right).\r<br>\u201cThe MPPS included particles with a diameter between 0.04 and 0.1 \u03bcm. As seen in \r<br>Figure 1 (left), particles that are smaller or larger than the MPPS are captured with higher \r<br>filtration efficiency. Filtration via diffusion (most noticeable for particles smaller than 0.1 \u03bcm) \r<br>actually increases as particle size decreases. Other research has confirmed that filter efficiency \r<br>increases with decreasing particle size, even for particles as small as 0.003 \u03bcm (much smaller \r<br>than that of virus).\u201d\r<br>It is important to note that the only way to ensure 100% efficiency of blocking particle \r<br>flow is to also block airflow. Without airflow, you will not receive oxygen, and you will \r<br>suffocate and die.
