Reason is pretty simple 1 gasoline does not burn gasoline fumes burn 2nd it takes time for heat to be imparted to the fumes smaller area under sea level air pressure longer to ignite compress it and o2 and you can get it to ignite with less flame /spark as the molecules are closer together and take less work to have heat transfered to them that is why car etc engines don&#39;t just pour gas in to a cylinder at top of stroke and light it off. The piston will move a little and slowly but wont do much work. You need that compression and air mix to be right for it to explode and do the work you want.

Gasoline boils at 85c, and it won&#39;t get any hotter than that since anything that gets hotter is converted to a gas. You&#39;d need to pressurize the system if you wanted to raise the boiling temp. The stuff that was left over are the additives that they add to control the octane and detergents. The autoignition temperature of gasoline is 280c, below that it&#39;ll need an ignition source, leave a candle next to the boiling gasoline and you&#39;ll see the vapors ignite as they pour over the vessel.", "comment_date": "2017-09-23T18:48:46Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Brandon Espinoza", "comment_text": "What happen if you melt aluminum foil and pour it into gasoline", "comment_date": "2017-09-23T18:47:49Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Augiukas", "comment_text": "what happen if u boil car oil?", "comment_date": "2017-09-23T18:47:48Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "ADIS", "comment_text": "Can you boile  antifreeze ?", "comment_date": "2017-09-23T18:47:41Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "sherri Huffman", "comment_text": "If there&#39;s some kind of metal in gasoline and gasoline won&#39;t ignite by boiling can u put it in a crucible and try to extract some kind of metal?", "comment_date": "2017-09-23T18:47:31Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "[FMTM] LilCeebzVert", "comment_text": "What happens if you light a whole tree on fire", "comment_date": "2017-09-23T18:47:03Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Junne 363", "comment_text": "What happens when you boil E85", "comment_date": "2017-09-23T18:46:08Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Geeks, Guns, and Gadgets !!!", "comment_text": "Can you make the flamethrower have a different color flame like the green fire from Game of Thrones???", "comment_date": "2017-09-23T18:45:48Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Austin Vanhoek", "comment_text": "What happens when u put dry ice in gasoline?", "comment_date": "2017-09-23T18:45:11Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Edgar B", "comment_text": "You should boil liquid nitrogen.", "comment_date": "2017-09-23T18:45:10Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "ZXS", "comment_text": "Can you make slime with liquid nitrogen?", "comment_date": "2017-09-23T18:44:42Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "ashish chhabra", "comment_text": "can you put a red hot glowing ball in a vacuum", "comment_date": "2017-09-23T18:44:41Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "NoodleBin", "comment_text": "boiling gasoline is part of making napalm", "comment_date": "2017-09-23T18:44:39Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "The Comedy Guys", "comment_text": "What happens when you boil acetone", "comment_date": "2017-09-23T18:44:00Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "603 Hunting & Fishing", "comment_text": "Can you make wood into paper please !!", "comment_date": "2017-09-23T18:43:15Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Kenneth Phillips", "comment_text": "The rope vidoe was kool and would be awesome to see another with some kind of purpose or something like that.", "comment_date": "2017-09-23T18:43:05Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Holden Schroyer", "comment_text": "What would happen if you froze gasoline then set it on fire? \ud83d\udd25", "comment_date": "2017-09-23T18:43:03Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Caiden Crawford", "comment_text": "What happens when you boil kerosene", "comment_date": "2017-09-23T18:43:00Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Rick Sanchez", "comment_text": "Could you make some kind of portable x-ray machine?", "comment_date": "2017-09-23T18:42:52Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Fox", "comment_text": "You didn&#39;t get anywhere near half of the gas in that container lol barely any made it in", "comment_date": "2017-09-23T18:42:15Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Caiden Crawford", "comment_text": "What happend when you boil diesel", "comment_date": "2017-09-23T18:41:43Z", "likes_count": 18}, {"comment_by": "KERNEL SANDERS", "comment_text": "What is Celsius, it&#39;s all about Fahrenheit in &#39;merica", "comment_date": "2017-09-23T18:41:36Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "monzee", "comment_text": "Can you ignite frozen gasoline", "comment_date": "2017-09-23T18:41:24Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Rabea Butto", "comment_text": "\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02 \u062a\u062d\u064a\u0629 \u0644\u0644\u0639\u0631\u0628 \u0648\u062c\u0631\u0627\u0646\u062a \u0627\u0644\u0644\u064a \u062d\u0627\u0648\u0644 \u064a\u0642\u0631\u0649 \u0645\u064a\u0643\u0633 \u0645\u0646\u0648\u0639\u0627\u062a \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02", "comment_date": "2017-09-23T18:40:55Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Moto Michael", "comment_text": "What happens if you soke your shirt in gasoline then boil it then light it.
