strong to handle all that pressure they are exposed to, and also, the rope would have been stronger still, IF you could have 1, made the fibers THINNER and 2, ROUNDER. <br><br>Scientific research shows that any plastic and some implastic materials (such as steel) can be made to hold more weight when turned into thinner fibers and then counter woven more thoroughly because of some little known but much speculated and theorized principles of molecular and atomic bonding principles still being researched.<br><br>Scientific research also shows that ,rounding a non-round fiber, either by drawing through a compression die, OR, by drawing through a shaving die, will allow the fibers to exert more pressure on each other before causing one-another to fail.<br><br>Each f the two rounding methods have different effects, as the compression die pre-stretches the fibers and realigns their internal molecules, which, in some plastics [again also some implastics] leads to dynamic improvements in molecular strength in the material.<br><br>ALSO compression die rounding [typically] results in a smoother, less cutting and less abrasive external surface, which is quite critical in and of its self to the lifespan of a rope.<br><br>A shaving die, on the other hand, mainly just takes away rough edges, break-leaders [the equivalent of cracks in vitreous and crystalline materials, which, some plastics are] and line tears [think of how cloth can be strong until a snag develops then the cloth (usually denim jeans, when working, in THE MOST embarrassing moments!) easily ans rapidly rips along a seam, and how some plastics, especially Mylar and similar PP plastics will do the same {visibly...the molecular action is a bit different} when a tiny split is formed in them] as well as some surface smoothing, again, reducing fiber-to-fiber abrasion induced failures.<br><br>And, finally, by narrowing the cross section, one is able to also reduce the crystalline bending radius [now they even have flexible ceramics because of this knowledge, although this is made by having nano-sized fibers...anything larger still breaks] so that typically rigid and brittle materials become quite pliable, reducing, if not eliminating their primary cause of mechanical failure.<br><br>This is why fiberglass is so flexible, despite being glass.", "comment_date": "2019-01-21T03:49:39Z",
