(basicalls just groups of atoms) are pointing in the same direction, when heat energy is added to the material it&#39;s domains start going wack and it stops being magnetized. When a magnet is put next to a feromagnetc material it temporarily points all of the domains in the same direction. so melting or heating a magnet would cause it to lose its magnetism, but I belive that you may be able to temporarily realign the domains in the material using a magnet that hasn&#39;t been heated up.", "comment_date": "2018-06-03T15:23:19Z", "likes_count": 44}, {"comment_by": "Benozai", "comment_text": "Its haunted", "comment_date": "2018-06-03T15:22:22Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Jb Steyn", "comment_text": "Molten copper vs wet cement", "comment_date": "2018-06-03T15:22:15Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "TotallyNotAFanficReader", "comment_text": "This....is so random...I LOVEE IT", "comment_date": "2018-06-03T15:21:55Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "John Peter", "comment_text": "Can you use the mega metal foundry ?", "comment_date": "2018-06-03T15:21:52Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Vemula Vijay Kumar", "comment_text": "Wow", "comment_date": "2018-06-03T15:21:51Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Caden Lipsky", "comment_text": "Loved the video I liked and subscribed", "comment_date": "2018-06-03T15:21:43Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Phillewonka", "comment_text": "Molten glass mixed with molten salt!", "comment_date": "2018-06-03T15:20:15Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Sirisha Amara", "comment_text": "Melt glass\ud83e\udd1f\ud83c\udffb", "comment_date": "2018-06-03T15:19:34Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Kelvin Van Der Ham", "comment_text": "Nice vid \ud83d\udc4d", "comment_date": "2018-06-03T15:19:28Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "EdvisDoz3", "comment_text": "Molten copper in dry ice!", "comment_date": "2018-06-03T15:19:26Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Rex Fc", "comment_text": "Awesome", "comment_date": "2018-06-03T15:19:17Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Mikel Juanes", "comment_text": "interesting way of casting a turd...", "comment_date": "2018-06-03T15:19:12Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Sivin", "comment_text": "how to make a oil ice using liquid nitrogen", "comment_date": "2018-06-03T15:18:35Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Konstantin Strau\u00df", "comment_text": "Please make a MOLOTOV cocktail.
