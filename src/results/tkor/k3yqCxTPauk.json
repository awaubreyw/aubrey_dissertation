Electroplating is very similar to making a voltaic cell. To make a primary voltaic cell you need copper(II)sulfate (aq), copper, zinc sulfate (aq), zinc, 2 non-metal containers, a tube to connect the solutions, cotton to plug the tube, and sodium chloride (aq). Fill the containers with the different sulfate solutions. Put each metal into the containers with their matching sulfates, copper with CuSO4 zinc with ZnSO4. Plug the tube ends with cotton and fill the tube with the sodium chloride solution. Connect the containers to the tube. Connect the metals with the wires and the reaction will begin. The copper (cathode)  wants the electrons more than the zinc (anode) can hold on to them so the zinc loses its electrons 2 per atom to be exact creating a ZnSO4 with a +2 oxidation state the electrons transfer through the wire to the copper where they attach themselves to a CuSO4 and turning it into a Cu and a SO4.", "comment_date": "2018-03-02T04:14:48Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "The Screaming Goat Production", "comment_text": "Electroplated gold please", "comment_date": "2018-03-02T04:14:08Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "MrKillaSnayke", "comment_text": "Great! now i can pay with copper nickels!", "comment_date": "2018-03-02T04:13:27Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Hylanos (OG)", "comment_text": "I was wondering if you could pressurize your flamethrower with dry ice and see what happens", "comment_date": "2018-03-02T04:09:30Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "GeneralFranky03", "comment_text": "Try pouring molten any metal into liquid nitrogen and pouring liquid nitrogen into the molten metal when it is still in the foundry", "comment_date": "2018-03-02T04:07:05Z", "likes_count": 4}, {"comment_by": "Justin Topp", "comment_text": "I have an adaptor that runs at 12v at 1.2 amps is this better is low power better ?", "comment_date": "2018-03-02T04:03:39Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Mrwhatsalot", "comment_text": "Make a penny very clean, like polish it.", "comment_date": "2018-03-02T04:01:15Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Paxton Dilworth", "comment_text": "Who is this new guy", "comment_date": "2018-03-02T03:56:47Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Ben Andrews", "comment_text": "If you have a LONG time just mix vinegar or lemon juice and salt, put a bunch of pennies in, put a spoon in and wait", "comment_date": "2018-03-02T03:56:20Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Sebastien Zammit", "comment_text": "this is awsome i did this in science today but i made copper sulphate turn to iron sulphate", "comment_date": "2018-03-02T03:55:16Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Anthony Rogers", "comment_text": "Can you try mixing molten aluminum and molten copper together and see if it is conductive enough to be plated?
