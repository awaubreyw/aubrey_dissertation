I just don&#39;t feel like going comment combing to find it.  My theory is Peanut Butter has a lot of oil in it.  Products using it will use reduced oil versions instead of the full oil versions.  Jarred PB has high content of oil hence why it wont freeze dry, Ice Creams, Candy Bars and other treats use more powder content/less oil.  PB powder is basically dried peanut butter it just has none of the oil or water contents you would normally see since they have been pressed out. I used to make nonfat PB with PB2-Dried PB product types. I believe the more powdery PB being used is reconstituting into the ice creams you are using in some cases...Something to consider..", "comment_date": "2021-01-18T17:35:07Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Jay-Lee van der Berg", "comment_text": "Make and freeze dry a \u201cwater droplet cake\u201d<br>Maybe also Jello for fun", "comment_date": "2021-01-06T10:02:33Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "tubbysnowman", "comment_text": "Hello Fresh is nice, but twice now I&#39;ve received bad chicken from them. of course because its sealed, you don&#39;t know it&#39;s bad until you go to open it to cook your meal.", "comment_date": "2021-01-03T23:09:44Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "April Curry", "comment_text": "Can you do removing the cream from oreos to see what you can do with it", "comment_date": "2021-01-02T16:09:46Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Ossie White", "comment_text": "Looks like peanut butter sandwich cookie peanut butter to me.", "comment_date": "2021-01-02T07:57:43Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Miram Tilem", "comment_text": "Peanutbutter is Vetter than this vid", "comment_date": "2021-01-01T19:47:06Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "WiseWoof", "comment_text": "How about freeze dried bubblegum.
