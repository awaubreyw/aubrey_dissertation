No doubt that freezing can keep your roasted coffee fresh for longer, but its not freezing the beans in the same way that you are freezing fluids. Coffee has very little fluid or water left in the beans after roasting, so its not really freezing the beans. Aldo those beans are darker roasted, so they are brittle because they have even less water than say, a medium roasted bean or a light roasted bean, thats why they are really brittle.<br><br>A lot of very basic mistakes and false advice, like sweetness and bitterness depending on what machine you use to brew the coffee and the temperature of the water? So the type of bean and the type of process, the roast level and the degassing has nothing to do with sweetness and bitterness? <br><br>Who in their right mind puts coffee beans in a food processer? That&#39;s your culprit right there, friction and heat from the processer, smashing those beans instead of consistently and uniformly grinding the beans is also going to destroy any chance of decent extraction and flavor.
