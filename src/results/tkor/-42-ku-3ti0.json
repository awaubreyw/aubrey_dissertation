Meanwhile, in a separate zip-lok bag, fill this bag with 60-70 ml&#39;s of plain tap water. Seal it. Put this water bag inside the bag with the calcium chloride. \r<br>\r<br>IMPORTANT TIP: Make sure you seal and tape the outer ziplok bag thoroughly, as you don&#39;t want it to break while you&#39;re in the cold!\r<br>\r<br>When ready to use, break just the water bag that&#39;s inside with the dry calcium chloride bag. When the calcium chloride gets wet from the water, this becomes your heat source (science).\r<br>\r<br>Your DIY hand warmer will create 45-60 mins of 45 C\u00b0 (or 113 F\u00b0) heat. Works great for your feet as well. Where do you get calcium chloride? Just buy an ice melter product (that salt stuff that melts ice on driveways or stairs). You can use anything that lists calcium chloride as the one and main ingredient but make sure it&#39;s calcium chloride. I use Prestone Driveway Heat Ice Melter calcium chloride pellets.
