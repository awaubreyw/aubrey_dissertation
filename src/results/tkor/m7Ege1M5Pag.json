Usually rese4ved for fish or poultry. Pack rock salt (and a few sprinkles of water to keep it in place) completely around a fish or bird, with seasonings inside the animals cavity. Baked in the oven, it solidifies around it so you have to break it off like clay. It imparts a completely different flavor that isn&#39;t usually too salty. It does seal in moisture. I wonder if there is something about that which could be used with molten salt. Maybe a single use clay dish the shape of the steak, filled first with molten salt, place the steak in, and cover it with more molten salt. Probably work better with Cornish game hens flattened out or something.
