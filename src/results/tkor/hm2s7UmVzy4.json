And then grab some electrical tape and tape over the area where you labeled what spray is being used.  That way you don&#39;t have any idea which coating your testing and just line up the squares from most durable to least durable  and wait until testing all the sections to reveal which coatings were labeled underneath the electrical tape<br><br>Also having a raw,  untreated,  &quot;control&quot; section would help too. ... that way you could test how much weight would be needed to scratch the raw version first before moving forward and testing the  treated sections. <br><br>\u00b2spraying the scratch proof sprays directly into the materials<br>\u2705 as long as you have a raw untreated section for comparison it&#39;s ok-ish<br>\u274c however,  if you want to get better results on just the scratch proof sprays performance alone, it might help to prime the materials being tested &amp; put a basecoat of paint (preferably a mat black,  so as to not have any glare and being able to inspect for scratches/ nicks/ imperfections that are already there and to either fix  (by sanding those areas to even out the entire area being tested) or to disregard those imperfections during the actual scratch test phase. <br><br><br>Overall,  I did enjoy the video and found it very useful and informative.
