Room looks like it could be around 1000 cuft, but we will use about half this for the following calculation. 512cuft room would be about 8 X 8 feet. 512cuft/8cuft = 64. The first setup would require 64 candle to heat a 8x8 room to 72 degrees with a temp outside of 70 degrees. The second setup would require 256 candles to heat the room to 72 degrees with an outside temp of 38. The 3rd setup would require 256 candles to heat the room to 72 degrees with an outside temp of 48 degrees. I would hope a home is more insulated compared to these boxes, but some are not.

You are right in that there is only so many BTU\u2019s per candle.  Burning straight up is just convection and we feel nothing but the room ceiling will.  The flower pot captures some of the convection, warms the thermal mass and then radiates it out.

You&#39;re better off keeping those tea lights for literally warming up tea. Drinking hot tea will warm your core directly, but simply burning a candle to try and heat a room, well you&#39;d have better luck moving a beach with a tweezers. The amount of radiant heat you get off those is negligible. If SHTF, close off all nonessential rooms, pitch a tent in your living room and throw a blanket over it. Put your air mattress down, then your sleeping bag on that. You&#39;ll be fine. Your pipes might freeze, but you won&#39;t die of hypothermia. And if you don&#39;t have a tent, sleeping bag, and air mattress, you&#39;re doing life wrong.<br>Of course it&#39;s best to have a backup heating system in place. My go-to is a dyna-glo kerosene heater and a 5 gallon tank of K-1. Enough to keep the living room warm and comfy for a few days, or survivable for a lot longer. Just make sure you have a carbon monoxide detector!

A candle heats up the air, and once the air flows away, you lose the heat. Putting a pot on it converts the heated up air into radiant heat, which is readily absorbed by solid objects, like the walls or people, and not much by air. This is why patio heaters and those used on some food trucks are the types that produce a lot of infrared - you can direct that at people and warm them up from a distance, while the air itself stays cold. Outside it isn&#39;t a closed system, so avoiding he heating up of air makes a lot of difference. And you can put your hands on the pot and warm them up without getting burned, and reduce the chance of wind blowing the candles out as a bonus. Indoors the air exchanges slowly enough for the pot to make much less difference, as the air has a lot of tome to exchange heat with everything.", "comment_date": "2021-12-11T18:53:55Z", "likes_count": 26}, {"comment_by": "Jason Yasumoto", "comment_text": "Love all the experiments you people do.
