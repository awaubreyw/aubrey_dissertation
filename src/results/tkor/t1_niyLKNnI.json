The boiling point of aromatic compounds are less then water (alcohol is also in this category), so they will still be present in the vapor and will condense. That&#39;s why you get a tree like taste after boiling apple juice. On the other hand brita removes the aromatic compounds better, they just get stuck in the filter. For salt: the boiling point of salt is much much higher than water so when boiling you get rid of it completely. On the other hand brita doesn&#39;t do much to salt water, as the molecules of salt just pass through the filter. What I would like to see is a combination of both methods.
