                "description": "With their short tongues, Valley carpenter bees can't easily drink the nectar from tubular flowers. So they use powerful mandibles to slice into the blooms and steal it. It's called nectar robbing, since the plants don't get the benefit of being pollinated by these enormous, fuzzy bees.\n\nSUBSCRIBE to Deep Look! https://www.youtube.com/user/kqeddeeplook?sub_confirmation=1\n\nDEEP LOOK is a ultra-HD (4K) short video series created by KQED San Francisco and presented by PBS Digital Studios. See the unseen at the very edge of our visible world. Explore big scientific mysteries by going incredibly small.\n\n--\n\nOn a warm spring day in California\u2019s Central Valley, a super fuzzy golden bee almost the size of your thumb flies in tight circles over red and white Hot lips salvia flowers. You\u2019re witnessing the fitness display of the largest bee in the Western United States \u2013 the Valley carpenter bee (Xylocopa sonorina). \n\nThe bright golden males of this species release a pheromone as they circle around a focal point, mimicking floral odors.  Researchers think that they are using the perfume-y scent to attract foraging female bees.  They hope that the all-black, shiny female bees will be impressed by their dizzying acrobatic displays, and decide to choose them as a mate. These striking males are colloquially referred to as \"Teddy bear bees.\"\n\nMany flowering plants in California\u2019s Central Valley produce tubular flowers which are hard to access with the bees' short tongue. Valley carpenter bees, like other types of carpenter bees, don\u2019t have the long tongues that other local pollinators may have (like some moths, butterflies, or hummingbirds). So instead of extending their tongues down a flower to reach nectar (and in the process pick up pollen at the front of the flower), these bees steal the nectar through a backdoor.  They use their powerful mandibles to bite a hole at the base of the flower and sip nectar from the side of the puncture, thus bypassing pollination. Researchers call this \u201cnectar robbing.\u201d\n\n---+ Why do carpenter bees eat wood?\n\nCarpenter bees are named for their ability to construct nests in wood \u2013 typically logs or human-made wooden structures. The bee nests are made of tunnels about \u00bd inch in diameter and 6 to 10 inches deep. The tunnels in a bee nest lead to several chambers, where the bees raise their young, as well as hibernate during colder months. In parts of the US, especially the Eastern US, carpenter bees are considered pests.\n\n\n---+ How do carpenter bees drill holes?\n\nThe female bees use their powerful mandibles to tunnel into dead wood\u2026 like logs, or tree trunks. Mama bees then lay their eggs and provide food for the developing offspring in these chambers.\n\nThe bees may return to the same nest for generations, expanding and renovating year after year.\nCarpenter bees don\u2019t have a queen, and they aren\u2019t as social as honeybees, but several bees may room together in a nest. \n\n---+ Find additional resources and a transcript on KQED Science:\n\nhttps://www.kqed.org/science/1979834/carpenter-bees-stab-flowers-to-steal-their-nectar\n\n---+ More Great Deep Look episodes:\n\nWatch This Bee Build Her Bee-jeweled Nest\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oPbH1YhsdP8\n\nThis Bee Builds Sandcastles at the Beach\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UfMCZYkG5Xo\n\n\ud83c\udfc6Congratulations\ud83c\udfc6 to the first 5 fans on our Deep Look Community Tab to correctly answer our GIF challenge!\n\nAntskerala\nSian Lazuli\nNC Strange\ncodeBread\nMohammed Yaser\n\n\n---+ Thank you to our Top Patreon Supporters ($10+ per month)!\n\nJessica\nBurt Humburg\nKaren Reynolds\nDaisuke Goto\nAllison & Maka Masuda\nDavid Deshpande\nHyper Music\nWild Turkey\nChris B Emrick\nTianxing Wang\nJ8Zenith\nCompanion Cube\nMark Jobes\nBlanca Vides\nmonoirre \nKevin Judge\nTitania Juang\nAurora \nRoberta K Wright\nSyniurge \nSupernovabetty \nAnastasia Grinkevic\nEl Samuels\nKW \nKimberly Hall\nCarrie Mukaida\nMehdi\nJellyman\nNicky Orino\nCristen Rasmussen\nShonara Rivas\nCindy McGill\nSonia Tanlimco\nSueEllen McCann\nMisia Clive\nNoreen Herrington\nKelly Hong\nCaitlin McDonough\nLouis O'Neill\nLaurel Przybylski\nShelley Pearson Cranshaw\nJoshua Murallon Robertson\nNicolette Ray\nJeremiah Sullivan\n\u5433\u6021\u5f70 \nWade Tregaskis\nElizabeth Ann Ditz\nSilvan\nDelphine Tseng\nShonara Rivas \nTierZoo \nLevi Cai\nJana Brenning \nKenneth Fyrsterling\n\n---+ Follow Deep Look and KQED Science on social:\n \nhttps://www.tiktok.com/@deeplookofficial\nhttps://www.patreon.com/deeplook\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/kqedscience/\nTwitter: https://www.twitter.com/kqedscience\n\n---+ About KQED\n\nKQED, an NPR and PBS affiliate in San Francisco, CA, serves Northern California and beyond with a public-supported alternative to commercial TV, Radio and web media.\n\nFunding for Deep Look is provided in part by PBS Digital Studios.

                    "title": "Teddy Bear Bees Stab Flowers To Steal Their Nectar | Deep Look",
                    "description": "With their short tongues, Valley carpenter bees can't easily drink the nectar from tubular flowers. So they use powerful mandibles to slice into the blooms and steal it. It's called nectar robbing, since the plants don't get the benefit of being pollinated by these enormous, fuzzy bees.\n\nSUBSCRIBE to Deep Look! https://www.youtube.com/user/kqeddeeplook?sub_confirmation=1\n\nDEEP LOOK is a ultra-HD (4K) short video series created by KQED San Francisco and presented by PBS Digital Studios. See the unseen at the very edge of our visible world. Explore big scientific mysteries by going incredibly small.\n\n--\n\nOn a warm spring day in California\u2019s Central Valley, a super fuzzy golden bee almost the size of your thumb flies in tight circles over red and white Hot lips salvia flowers. You\u2019re witnessing the fitness display of the largest bee in the Western United States \u2013 the Valley carpenter bee (Xylocopa sonorina). \n\nThe bright golden males of this species release a pheromone as they circle around a focal point, mimicking floral odors.  Researchers think that they are using the perfume-y scent to attract foraging female bees.  They hope that the all-black, shiny female bees will be impressed by their dizzying acrobatic displays, and decide to choose them as a mate. These striking males are colloquially referred to as \"Teddy bear bees.\"\n\nMany flowering plants in California\u2019s Central Valley produce tubular flowers which are hard to access with the bees' short tongue. Valley carpenter bees, like other types of carpenter bees, don\u2019t have the long tongues that other local pollinators may have (like some moths, butterflies, or hummingbirds). So instead of extending their tongues down a flower to reach nectar (and in the process pick up pollen at the front of the flower), these bees steal the nectar through a backdoor.  They use their powerful mandibles to bite a hole at the base of the flower and sip nectar from the side of the puncture, thus bypassing pollination. Researchers call this \u201cnectar robbing.\u201d\n\n---+ Why do carpenter bees eat wood?\n\nCarpenter bees are named for their ability to construct nests in wood \u2013 typically logs or human-made wooden structures. The bee nests are made of tunnels about \u00bd inch in diameter and 6 to 10 inches deep. The tunnels in a bee nest lead to several chambers, where the bees raise their young, as well as hibernate during colder months. In parts of the US, especially the Eastern US, carpenter bees are considered pests.\n\n\n---+ How do carpenter bees drill holes?\n\nThe female bees use their powerful mandibles to tunnel into dead wood\u2026 like logs, or tree trunks. Mama bees then lay their eggs and provide food for the developing offspring in these chambers.\n\nThe bees may return to the same nest for generations, expanding and renovating year after year.\nCarpenter bees don\u2019t have a queen, and they aren\u2019t as social as honeybees, but several bees may room together in a nest. \n\n---+ Find additional resources and a transcript on KQED Science:\n\nhttps://www.kqed.org/science/1979834/carpenter-bees-stab-flowers-to-steal-their-nectar\n\n---+ More Great Deep Look episodes:\n\nWatch This Bee Build Her Bee-jeweled Nest\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oPbH1YhsdP8\n\nThis Bee Builds Sandcastles at the Beach\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UfMCZYkG5Xo\n\n\ud83c\udfc6Congratulations\ud83c\udfc6 to the first 5 fans on our Deep Look Community Tab to correctly answer our GIF challenge!\n\nAntskerala\nSian Lazuli\nNC Strange\ncodeBread\nMohammed Yaser\n\n\n---+ Thank you to our Top Patreon Supporters ($10+ per month)!\n\nJessica\nBurt Humburg\nKaren Reynolds\nDaisuke Goto\nAllison & Maka Masuda\nDavid Deshpande\nHyper Music\nWild Turkey\nChris B Emrick\nTianxing Wang\nJ8Zenith\nCompanion Cube\nMark Jobes\nBlanca Vides\nmonoirre \nKevin Judge\nTitania Juang\nAurora \nRoberta K Wright\nSyniurge \nSupernovabetty \nAnastasia Grinkevic\nEl Samuels\nKW \nKimberly Hall\nCarrie Mukaida\nMehdi\nJellyman\nNicky Orino\nCristen Rasmussen\nShonara Rivas\nCindy McGill\nSonia Tanlimco\nSueEllen McCann\nMisia Clive\nNoreen Herrington\nKelly Hong\nCaitlin McDonough\nLouis O'Neill\nLaurel Przybylski\nShelley Pearson Cranshaw\nJoshua Murallon Robertson\nNicolette Ray\nJeremiah Sullivan\n\u5433\u6021\u5f70 \nWade Tregaskis\nElizabeth Ann Ditz\nSilvan\nDelphine Tseng\nShonara Rivas \nTierZoo \nLevi Cai\nJana Brenning \nKenneth Fyrsterling\n\n---+ Follow Deep Look and KQED Science on social:\n \nhttps://www.tiktok.com/@deeplookofficial\nhttps://www.patreon.com/deeplook\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/kqedscience/\nTwitter: https://www.twitter.com/kqedscience\n\n---+ About KQED\n\nKQED, an NPR and PBS affiliate in San Francisco, CA, serves Northern California and beyond with a public-supported alternative to commercial TV, Radio and web media.\n\nFunding for Deep Look is provided in part by PBS Digital Studios.

The menacing culprit: a giant water bug.\n\nLurking just below the surface of that flowing creek or refreshing pond, these bugs resemble enormous aquatic ticks, with googly eyes and praying mantis arms. And although they won\u2019t seek you out for an attack, they also won\u2019t hesitate to take a defensive bite if you get too close, earning them the nickname \u201ctoe-biters.\u201d\n\nThey puncture the skin with dagger-like mouth parts and have a bite known as one of the most painful of any insect \u2013 sharp and stinging like a wasp\u2019s.

And a swollen, throbbing toe.\n\n--- What do giant water bugs eat?\nGiant water bugs are voracious predators that will take down any small animals they can subdue. They have a long needle-like mouth and their bite contains a cocktail of chemicals that paralyzes their prey and digests their tissues. Then the giant water bugs slurp up its meal. Giant water bugs hunt other insects, tadpoles and frogs, small fish, and even the occasional duckling.\n\n--- How do giant water bugs breathe?\nGiant water bugs spend their lives in freshwater, but they must return to the surface to breathe. Giant water bugs have two little air straps that protrude from their backside. The air straps work like a snorkel to pull air into a bubble trapped under their wings. \n\n--- What do giant water bugs taste like?\nIn Southeast Asia giant water bugs are sometimes eaten as a regional delicacy. Like other arthropods, giant water bugs are said to taste a bit like shrimp with a slightly sweet flavor.\n\n---+ Read the entire article on KQED Science:\n\nhttps://www.kqed.org/science/1979474/dont-go-chasing-water-bugs\n \n---+ More great Deep Look episodes:\n\nYou Can\u2019t Unsee the Assassin Bug\u2019s Dirty Work | Deep Look\nhttps://youtu.be/bdzK-pTadQs\n\nTadpole Shrimp Are Coming For Your Rice | Deep Look\nhttps://youtu.be/T2xnXaX7r3g\n\nBorn Pregnant: Aphids Invade with an Onslaught of Clones | Deep Look\nhttps://youtu.be/vrzalLssomg\n\n\n---+ Shoutout!\n\n\ud83c\udfc6Congratulations\ud83c\udfc6 to the following fans on our Deep Look Community Tab for correctly answering our GIF Challenge!\n\nAA-Ron\n\n---+ Thank you to our Top Patreon Supporters ($10+ per month)!\n\nJessica\nBurt Humburg\nKaren Reynolds\nDaisuke Goto\nAllison & Maka Masuda\nDavid Deshpande\nWild Turkey\nChris B Emrick\nJ8Zenith\nTianxing Wang\nCompanion Cube\nMark Jobes\nBlanca Vides\nKevin Judge\nJana Brenning \nmonoirre \nAurora \nAnastasia Grinkevic\nSupernovabetty \nTitania Juang\nRoberta K Wright\nKW \nKimberly Hall\nSyniurge \nEl Samuels\nCarrie Mukaida\nJellyman\nNicky Orino\nCristen Rasmussen\nKristy Freeman\nMehdi\nLaurel Przybylski\nSueEllen McCann\nCindy McGill\nShonara Rivas\nKelly Hong\nLouis O'Neill\nSonia Tanlimco\nNicolette Ray\nMisia Clive\nJeremiah Sullivan\nJoshua Murallon Robertson\nCaitlin McDonough\nShelley Pearson Cranshaw\nNoreen Herrington\nWade Tregaskis\n\u5433\u6021\u5f70  \nShonara Rivas \nElizabeth Ann Ditz\nSilvan\nDelphine Tseng\nTierZoo \nLevi Cai\nKenneth Fyrsterling\n\n\n---+ Follow Deep Look and KQED Science on social:\n \nhttps://www.tiktok.com/@deeplookofficial\nhttps://www.patreon.com/deeplook\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/kqedscience/\nTwitter: https://www.twitter.com/kqedscience\n\n\n---+ About KQED\n\nKQED, an NPR and PBS affiliate in San Francisco, CA, serves Northern California and beyond with a public-supported alternative to commercial TV, Radio and web media.\n\nFunding for Deep Look is provided in part by PBS Digital Studios.

                "description": "The spotted wing drosophila may look like a common fruit fly, but it\u2019s so much worse. Just as strawberries, blueberries, raspberries and blackberries are ripening in the field, this fly saws into them and lays her eggs inside. The growing maggots turn the fruit into a mushy mess. Could a wasp and its own hungry maggots save the day?\n\nSUBSCRIBE to Deep Look! https://www.youtube.com/user/kqeddeeplook?sub_confirmation=1\nPlease join our community on Patreon! https://www.patreon.com/deeplook\n\nDEEP LOOK is a ultra-HD (4K) short video series created by KQED San Francisco and presented by PBS Digital Studios. See the unseen at the very edge of our visible world. Explore big scientific mysteries by going incredibly small.\n\n--- \n\nTo cut into fruit and lay their eggs, female spotted wing drosophila flies use a long tool at the back of their bodies. This ovipositor has two rows of teeth that they dig into firm fruit while it\u2019s still on the bush. The maggots that grow from the eggs ruin the fruit so that it never makes it to market.\n\nIn comparison, the common fruit fly milling about in your kitchen has a smoother, shorter ovipositor with which it can only dig into rotting fruit, like the bananas you didn\u2019t get to.\n\nSpotted wing drosophila are originally from East Asia and have spread around the world, helped in part by their ability to survive through a cold winter. To protect their crops, growers have to spray insecticides to kill them. \n\nThat\u2019s why scientists are introducing a less toxic option, a parasitic wasp called Ganaspis brasiliensis, which is also from Asia. Females of this wasp lay their eggs inside the maggots of a spotted wing drosophila. The U.S. Department of Agriculture recently approved the release of the wasp in the United States. Scientists are now planning large releases in California and other affected areas around the country this summer, said University of California, Berkeley, entomologist Kent Daane, who studies the insect. \n\n--- What do spotted wing drosophila look like?\nThey get their name from the black spot near the tip of each of the male\u2019s wings. Otherwise, they look fairly similar to the common fruit fly.\n\n--- What crops do spotted wing drosophila impact? \nIn addition to strawberries, raspberries, blueberries and blackberries, they also infest cherries and stone fruits. They\u2019re a pest of wine grapes in places like Switzerland, though not in California.\n\n--- How do organic berry farmers control spotted wing drosophila?\nThey apply pesticides approved for use in organic farming, such as spinosad, a natural substance produced by a soil bacterium. They also try to keep the flies away from their crops in the first place. For example, they cut down vegetation growing near their fields, such as invasive Himalayan blackberry plants where the flies like to live when they\u2019re not feeding on ripening crops. \n\n---+ Find a transcript and additional resources on KQED Science: \nhttps://www.kqed.org/science/1979380/this-freaky-fruit-fly-lays-eggs-in-your-strawberries\n\n---+ More Great Deep Look episodes:\n\nThis Killer Fungus Turns Flies into Zombies\nhttps://youtu.be/C2Jw5ib-s_I\n\nHere\u2019s How That Annoying Fly Dodges Your Swatter\nhttps://youtu.be/jBPFCvEhv9Y\n\n---+ Shoutout!\n\n\ud83c\udfc6Congratulations\ud83c\udfc6 to the first 5 fans on our Deep Look Community Tab to correctly answer our GIF challenge!\n\nAhmed Hadwan\noluwatobiloba oluwafemi\nOzborne\nMoxxie :D\nabloobloo\n\n\n---+ Thank you to our Top Patreon Supporters ($10+ per month)!\n\nJessica\nChris B Emrick\nBurt Humburg\nKaren Reynolds\nDaisuke Goto\nAdam Kurtz\nAllison & Maka Masuda\nDavid Deshpande\nWild Turkey\nTianxing Wang\nCompanion Cube\nMark Jobes\nBlanca Vides\nKevin Judge\nJana Brenning \nAurora \nmonoirre \nRoberta K Wright\nAnastasia Grinkevic\nTitania Juang\nSupernovabetty \nSyniurge \nCarrie Mukaida\nKW \nEl Samuels\nJellyman\nCristen Rasmussen\nScott Faunce\nMehdi\nNicky Orino\nKristy Freeman\nNoreen Herrington\nCindy McGill\nSonia Tanlimco\nKelly Hong\nSueEllen McCann\nNicolette Ray\nCaitlin McDonough\nLaurel Przybylski\nLouis O'Neill\nShelley Pearson Cranshaw\nRobert Amling\nMisia Clive\n\u5433\u6021\u5f70 \nJeremiah Sullivan\nDelphine Tseng\nLevi Cai\nSilvan\nJoshua Murallon Robertson\nTierZoo \nShonara Rivas \nWade Tregaskis\nElizabeth Ann Ditz\nKenneth Fyrsterling\n\n\n---+ Follow Deep Look and KQED Science on social:\n \nTikTok: https://www.tiktok.com/@deeplookofficial\nPatreon: https://www.patreon.com/deeplook\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/kqedscience/\nTwitter: https://www.twitter.com/kqedscience\n\n---+ About KQED\n\nKQED, an NPR and PBS affiliate in San Francisco, CA, serves Northern California and beyond with a public-supported alternative to commercial TV, Radio and web media.\n\nFunding for Deep Look is provided in part by PBS Digital Studios.

Silkworms spin a cocoon with a single strand of silk up to ten city blocks long. Humans have bred these insects into weaving machines that can no longer survive in the wild.\n\nSUBSCRIBE to Deep Look! https://www.youtube.com/user/kqeddeeplook?sub_confirmation=1\nPlease join our community on Patreon! https://www.patreon.com/deeplook\n\nDEEP LOOK is an ultra-HD (4K) short video series created by KQED San Francisco and presented by PBS Digital Studios. See the unseen at the very edge of our visible world. Explore big scientific mysteries by going incredibly small. \n\n\u2014\nThe sumptuous silk in your satiny sheets and glamorous gowns comes from humble beginnings \u2013 a caterpillar of the domesticated silk moth.  For almost five thousand years, people have raised silkworms for their unique, shimmering material. In just a few days, these caterpillars produce one fine thread of silk one kilometer long, and intricately weave it into their cocoons. \n\nFor most silkworms in captivity, this is where their journey ends. To preserve the integrity of the continuous silk thread in each cocoon, silk farmers kill the pupa inside the chrysalis by boiling, steam, or sun. Then the strands are loosened in hot water and unwound by hand using specialized spinners and silk harvesting tools. This raw silk is then gathered onto large spools and refined into commercially valuable threads. It can take up to 2000 silkworms to make one silk dress. \n\nToday, the silk industry is valued at more than $10 billion globally, but it is more than just a luxury item. Silk is pound-for-pound stronger than steel, and it is now used in medicine to heal bones and tendons. Our five thousand year love affair with this extraordinary material continues to hold silkworms captive -- until we learn to spin silk better than they can.\n\n__\n \n\u2013 What other insects produce silk?\n \nAnimal-produced silk is actually quite common in the natural world. Spiders (of course), fleas, webspinners, caddisflies and even some ants and bees make silk. But only the silk made by the caterpillar of the domestic silk moth is widely cultivated by humans. \n \n\u2013 Are silkworms edible?\n \nYes! Silkworms are enjoyed as a nutritious snack in many countries, including Thailand, Vietnam, China and Madagascar.\n \n\u2013 Where do wild silk moths live?\n \nDomestic silk moths (Bombyx mori) can\u2019t survive in the wild without help from humans, but their cousins \u2013 the wild silk moth (Bombyx mandarina) can be found in Asia, in countries like China, Korea and Japan.\n \n \n---+ More great Deep Look episodes:\n \n The Curious Webspinner Insect Knits a Cozy Home\n https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_JP3RbJ8zk\n\nIs a Spider's Web a Part of Its Mind?\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rpwkgMX4IlQ\n\n---+ Shoutout!\n \n\ud83c\udfc6Congratulations\ud83c\udfc6 to the first 5 (well, 6, we missed R Alan!) fans on our Deep Look Community Tab to correctly answer our GIF challenge!\n\nTheMicroGuy\nTheWhiteScatterbug\nManish Ravi\nBobBob\nJuhi Shah\nR Alan\n \n---+ Thank you to our Top Patreon Supporters ($10+ per month)!\n \n Chris B Emrick\nBurt Humburg\nKaren Reynolds\nDaisuke Goto\nAdam Kurtz\nAllison & Maka Masuda\nDavid Deshpande\nWild Turkey\nTianxing Wang\nCompanion Cube\nMark Jobes\nBlanca Vides\nKevin Judge\nJana Brenning \nAurora \nmonoirre \nRoberta K Wright\nAnastasia Grinkevic\nTitania Juang\nSupernovabetty \nSyniurge \nCarrie Mukaida\nKW \nEl Samuels\nJellyman\nCristen Rasmussen\nScott Faunce\nMehdi\nNicky Orino\nKristy Freeman\nNoreen Herrington\nCindy McGill\nSonia Tanlimco\nKelly Hong\nSueEllen McCann\nNicolette Ray\nCaitlin McDonough\nLaurel Przybylski\nLouis O'Neill\nShelley Pearson Cranshaw\nRobert Amling\nMisia Clive\n\u5433\u6021\u5f70 \nJeremiah Sullivan\nDelphine Tseng\nLevi Cai\nSilvan\nJoshua Murallon Robertson\nTierZoo \nShonara Rivas \nWade Tregaskis\nElizabeth Ann Ditz\nKenneth Fyrsterling\n\n---+ Follow Deep Look and KQED Science on social:\n \nhttps://www.tiktok.com/@deeplookofficial\nhttps://www.patreon.com/deeplook\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/kqedscience/\nTwitter: https://www.twitter.com/kqedscience\n \n---+ About KQED\n\nKQED, an NPR and PBS affiliate in San Francisco, CA, serves Northern California and beyond with a public-supported alternative to commercial TV, Radio and web media.\n\nFunding for Deep Look is provided in part by PBS Digital Studios.

Then they need food to fill them up. The species of honeypot ant featured in our video, Myrmecocystus mexicanus, forages at night in the Southwest and Mexico. Workers venture out of their nest at dusk and collect nectar from plants, as well as other sweet liquids they slurp from the backsides of tiny animals like aphids. And they gather dead insects, such as other ants. Some of the fat and protein they extract from the insects will end up inside the repletes.    \n\nWorkers carry the nectar and other liquids back to the nest inside their own abdomens. Then they transfer it, mouth to mouth, to the ants they\u2019re turning into repletes. \n\nThe liquid flows into a pouch in the replete\u2019s abdomen called the crop. This is the part of the ant that swells into a storage tank.

                "description": "The vinegaroon \u2013 also known as a whip scorpion \u2013 looks like a Frankenstein creation of monster body parts. But unlike true scorpions, it doesn\u2019t use venom to defend itself from predators. Instead, it aims its tail at their face and sprays a blast of acid that reeks of \u2013 you guessed it \u2013 vinegar. Only this weaponized vinegar is 16 times stronger than what\u2019s in your salad.\n\nSUBSCRIBE to Deep Look! http://goo.gl/8NwXqt\u200b \nPlease join our community on Patreon! https://www.patreon.com/deeplook\u200b\n\nDEEP LOOK is an ultra-HD (4K) short video series created by KQED San Francisco and presented by PBS Digital Studios. See the unseen at the very edge of our visible world. Explore big scientific mysteries by going incredibly small. \n\n\u2014\n\nDistant relatives of scorpions and spiders \u2013 vinegaroons have evolved a unique form of defense. If you bother them, the worst you might experience as a large mammal with eyes, would be an irritating blast of strong vinegar-smelling acid in your face.\n\nWhen under threat from predators \u2013 mostly foraging night hunters like coyotes, skunks and lizards \u2013 it will spray a solution of acetic acid from two glands just above the base of its tail.  This spray is made up of about 85% acetic acid (the primary component of vinegar) and about 15% caprylic acid (another slightly unpleasant-smelling acid).  It is able to aim the spray in any direction with its tail, and can shoot up to 5 times before it needs to replenish the fluids. \n\nThe tail also bristles with tiny hairs that serve to help the animal sense vibrations in the air, and pick up chemical traces of other members of the species, as well as prey. \n__\n\n\n\u2013 What\u2019s the difference between a vinegaroon (aka whip scorpion) and a scorpion?\n\nAlthough they are both arachnids, a vinegaroon is not a scorpion.  Vinegaroons are sometimes referred to as whip scorpions, with a skinny whiplike tail instead of scorpions\u2019 typical segmented tail with a stinger.  Unlike true scorpions, vinegaroons don\u2019t sting or produce venom. \n\n\u2013 What do vinegaroons eat?\n\nTheir diets consist of a variety of small invertebrates \u2013 including millipedes, crickets, roaches, scorpions and mealworms. Vinegaroons lead solitary lives, and may even cannibalize other smaller vinegaroons.\n\n\u2013 Where do vinegaroons live?\nThere are over 100 species of vinegaroons worldwide, found in tropical and subtropical areas in North America, South America, Asia and Africa.  The species we feature in our episode is the Giant vinegaroon (Mastigoproctus giganteus), which lives in the southern US and Mexico.

                    "description": "The vinegaroon \u2013 also known as a whip scorpion \u2013 looks like a Frankenstein creation of monster body parts. But unlike true scorpions, it doesn\u2019t use venom to defend itself from predators. Instead, it aims its tail at their face and sprays a blast of acid that reeks of \u2013 you guessed it \u2013 vinegar. Only this weaponized vinegar is 16 times stronger than what\u2019s in your salad.\n\nSUBSCRIBE to Deep Look! http://goo.gl/8NwXqt\u200b \nPlease join our community on Patreon! https://www.patreon.com/deeplook\u200b\n\nDEEP LOOK is an ultra-HD (4K) short video series created by KQED San Francisco and presented by PBS Digital Studios. See the unseen at the very edge of our visible world. Explore big scientific mysteries by going incredibly small. \n\n\u2014\n\nDistant relatives of scorpions and spiders \u2013 vinegaroons have evolved a unique form of defense. If you bother them, the worst you might experience as a large mammal with eyes, would be an irritating blast of strong vinegar-smelling acid in your face.\n\nWhen under threat from predators \u2013 mostly foraging night hunters like coyotes, skunks and lizards \u2013 it will spray a solution of acetic acid from two glands just above the base of its tail.  This spray is made up of about 85% acetic acid (the primary component of vinegar) and about 15% caprylic acid (another slightly unpleasant-smelling acid).  It is able to aim the spray in any direction with its tail, and can shoot up to 5 times before it needs to replenish the fluids. \n\nThe tail also bristles with tiny hairs that serve to help the animal sense vibrations in the air, and pick up chemical traces of other members of the species, as well as prey. \n__\n\n\n\u2013 What\u2019s the difference between a vinegaroon (aka whip scorpion) and a scorpion?\n\nAlthough they are both arachnids, a vinegaroon is not a scorpion.  Vinegaroons are sometimes referred to as whip scorpions, with a skinny whiplike tail instead of scorpions\u2019 typical segmented tail with a stinger.  Unlike true scorpions, vinegaroons don\u2019t sting or produce venom. \n\n\u2013 What do vinegaroons eat?\n\nTheir diets consist of a variety of small invertebrates \u2013 including millipedes, crickets, roaches, scorpions and mealworms. Vinegaroons lead solitary lives, and may even cannibalize other smaller vinegaroons.\n\n\u2013 Where do vinegaroons live?\nThere are over 100 species of vinegaroons worldwide, found in tropical and subtropical areas in North America, South America, Asia and Africa.  The species we feature in our episode is the Giant vinegaroon (Mastigoproctus giganteus), which lives in the southern US and Mexico.

Its goopy lattice gives off a rotten odor that attracts flies, which help spread its spores far and wide. It's like a bee to a flower, but way more macabre and putrid.\n\nSUBSCRIBE to Deep Look! http://goo.gl/8NwXqt\nPlease join our community on Patreon! https://www.patreon.com/deeplook\n\nDEEP LOOK is an ultra-HD (4K) short video series created by KQED San Francisco and presented by PBS Digital Studios. See the unseen at the very edge of our visible world. Explore big scientific mysteries by going incredibly small.\n\n---\nCage fungus gets its name from the shape of its spongy lattice-shaped mushroom. \u201cIt's this kind of red-orange geodesic dome,\u201d says naturalist Damon Tighe. \u201cThey can get up to the size of a softball and they're open on the inside where they've got this sticky, gooey substance called gleba.\u201d \n\nThe gleba contains the fungus\u2019 reproductive spores and it\u2019s the gleba that gives the mushroom its fetid aroma. \n\n\u201cIt reeks of death,\u201d says Tighe. \u201cIf you get up close to it, there are these sharp notes that hit your nose that just make you recoil immediately.\u201d\n\nFlies that normally feed on stinky things like carrion and feces are drawn to the smell. They lap up the gleba, inadvertently downing millions of the spores and spreading them far and wide.\n\n--- What is red cage fungus?\nClathrus ruber is a type of stinkhorn mushroom. Like most mushrooms, what you see above ground is only a small percent of the entire organism. Most of it is made up of a network of thin threads called the mycelium. When the conditions are right, the mycelium produces an \u201cegg\u201d that pops up above ground. When it's mature, the lattice structure called a receptacle bursts out from the \u201cegg.\u201d\n\n--- Why do cage fungus smell so bad?\nThe gleba found on the inside surfaces of the cage fungus fruiting body contains compounds like dimethyl sulfide, which smells like rotten eggs. The foul smell attracts flies that spread the fungus\u2019 spores.\n\n--- What do cage fungus eat?\nCage fungus is saprobic, feeding on dead and dying wood. The fungus\u2019 mycelium digest the cellulose in the wood, returning nutrients to the soil.\n\n\n---+ Find additional resources and a transcript on KQED Science:\nhttps://www.kqed.org/science/1978560/this-mushroom-tricks-flies-by-faking-its-own-death\n \n---+ More great Deep Look episodes:\n\nThis Killer Fungus Turns Flies into Zombies | Deep Look\nhttps://youtu.be/C2Jw5ib-s_I\n\nThis Mushroom Starts Killing You Before You Even Realize It | Deep Look\nhttps://youtu.be/bl9aCH2QaQY\n\nHere\u2019s How That Annoying Fly Dodges Your Swatter | Deep Look\nhttps://youtu.be/jBPFCvEhv9Y\n\n\n---+ Shoutout!\n\n\ud83c\udfc6Congratulations\ud83c\udfc6 to the following 5 fans on our Deep Look Community Tab for identifying why the female oak moth is fanning her wings \u2015 to spread her pheromones to attract males!\n\nNorwyn\nKenzo Hofmeister\nH\u00e8ctor Bonnin Obach\nTu fon Kin\nMeEeDo\n\n---+ Thank you to our Top Patreon Supporters ($10+ per month)!\n\nJessica\nChris B Emrick\nBurt Humburg\nKaren Reynolds\nDavid Deshpande\nDaisuke Goto\nAllison & Maka Masuda\nAdam Kurtz\nTianxing Wang\nCompanion Cube\nJosh Kuroda\nWild Turkey\nGerm\u00e1n Bot\u00f3n Garc\u00eda\nMark Jobes\nBlanca Vides\nKevin Judge\nJana Brenning \nAurora \nmonoirre \nTitania Juang\nRoberta K Wright\nAnastasia Grinkevic\nSyniurge \nSupernovabetty \nCarrie Mukaida\nKW \nEl Samuels\nJellyman\nNicky O.\nCristen Rasmussen\nMehdi\nKristy Freeman\nScott Faunce\nSueEllen McCann\nKelly Hong\nSonia Tanlimco\nNoreen Herrington\nCindy McGill\nLouis O'Neill\nMisia Clive\nLaurel Przybylski\nShelley Pearson Cranshaw\nJeremiah Sullivan\nJoshua Murallon Robertson\nNicolette Ray\nCaitlin McDonough\nWade Tregaskis\n\u5433\u6021\u5f70  \nLevi Cai\nShonara Rivas \nkenneth nguyen !\nSilvan\nDelphine Tseng\nTierZoo \nElizabeth Ann Ditz\nCorvus Crudus\nrafael pirondi\n\n---+ Follow KQED Science and Deep Look:\n \nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/kqedscience/\nTwitter: https://www.twitter.com/kqedscience\n\n---+ About KQED\n\nKQED, an NPR and PBS affiliate in San Francisco, California, serves Northern California and beyond with a public-supported alternative to commercial TV, radio and web media.\n\nFunding for Deep Look is provided in part by PBS Digital Studios.

                    "description": "The cage fungus looks and smells like decaying meat \u2014 on purpose. Its goopy lattice gives off a rotten odor that attracts flies, which help spread its spores far and wide. It's like a bee to a flower, but way more macabre and putrid.\n\nSUBSCRIBE to Deep Look! http://goo.gl/8NwXqt\nPlease join our community on Patreon! https://www.patreon.com/deeplook\n\nDEEP LOOK is an ultra-HD (4K) short video series created by KQED San Francisco and presented by PBS Digital Studios.

Explore big scientific mysteries by going incredibly small.\n\n---\nCage fungus gets its name from the shape of its spongy lattice-shaped mushroom. \u201cIt's this kind of red-orange geodesic dome,\u201d says naturalist Damon Tighe. \u201cThey can get up to the size of a softball and they're open on the inside where they've got this sticky, gooey substance called gleba.\u201d \n\nThe gleba contains the fungus\u2019 reproductive spores and it\u2019s the gleba that gives the mushroom its fetid aroma. \n\n\u201cIt reeks of death,\u201d says Tighe. \u201cIf you get up close to it, there are these sharp notes that hit your nose that just make you recoil immediately.\u201d\n\nFlies that normally feed on stinky things like carrion and feces are drawn to the smell. They lap up the gleba, inadvertently downing millions of the spores and spreading them far and wide.\n\n--- What is red cage fungus?\nClathrus ruber is a type of stinkhorn mushroom. Like most mushrooms, what you see above ground is only a small percent of the entire organism. Most of it is made up of a network of thin threads called the mycelium. When the conditions are right, the mycelium produces an \u201cegg\u201d that pops up above ground. When it's mature, the lattice structure called a receptacle bursts out from the \u201cegg.\u201d\n\n--- Why do cage fungus smell so bad?\nThe gleba found on the inside surfaces of the cage fungus fruiting body contains compounds like dimethyl sulfide, which smells like rotten eggs. The foul smell attracts flies that spread the fungus\u2019 spores.\n\n--- What do cage fungus eat?\nCage fungus is saprobic, feeding on dead and dying wood. The fungus\u2019 mycelium digest the cellulose in the wood, returning nutrients to the soil.\n\n\n---+ Find additional resources and a transcript on KQED Science:\nhttps://www.kqed.org/science/1978560/this-mushroom-tricks-flies-by-faking-its-own-death\n \n---+ More great Deep Look episodes:\n\nThis Killer Fungus Turns Flies into Zombies | Deep Look\nhttps://youtu.be/C2Jw5ib-s_I\n\nThis Mushroom Starts Killing You Before You Even Realize It | Deep Look\nhttps://youtu.be/bl9aCH2QaQY\n\nHere\u2019s How That Annoying Fly Dodges Your Swatter | Deep Look\nhttps://youtu.be/jBPFCvEhv9Y\n\n\n---+ Shoutout!\n\n\ud83c\udfc6Congratulations\ud83c\udfc6 to the following 5 fans on our Deep Look Community Tab for identifying why the female oak moth is fanning her wings \u2015 to spread her pheromones to attract males!\n\nNorwyn\nKenzo Hofmeister\nH\u00e8ctor Bonnin Obach\nTu fon Kin\nMeEeDo\n\n---+ Thank you to our Top Patreon Supporters ($10+ per month)!\n\nJessica\nChris B Emrick\nBurt Humburg\nKaren Reynolds\nDavid Deshpande\nDaisuke Goto\nAllison & Maka Masuda\nAdam Kurtz\nTianxing Wang\nCompanion Cube\nJosh Kuroda\nWild Turkey\nGerm\u00e1n Bot\u00f3n Garc\u00eda\nMark Jobes\nBlanca Vides\nKevin Judge\nJana Brenning \nAurora \nmonoirre \nTitania Juang\nRoberta K Wright\nAnastasia Grinkevic\nSyniurge \nSupernovabetty \nCarrie Mukaida\nKW \nEl Samuels\nJellyman\nNicky O.\nCristen Rasmussen\nMehdi\nKristy Freeman\nScott Faunce\nSueEllen McCann\nKelly Hong\nSonia Tanlimco\nNoreen Herrington\nCindy McGill\nLouis O'Neill\nMisia Clive\nLaurel Przybylski\nShelley Pearson Cranshaw\nJeremiah Sullivan\nJoshua Murallon Robertson\nNicolette Ray\nCaitlin McDonough\nWade Tregaskis\n\u5433\u6021\u5f70  \nLevi Cai\nShonara Rivas \nkenneth nguyen !\nSilvan\nDelphine Tseng\nTierZoo \nElizabeth Ann Ditz\nCorvus Crudus\nrafael pirondi\n\n---+ Follow KQED Science and Deep Look:\n \nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/kqedscience/\nTwitter: https://www.twitter.com/kqedscience\n\n---+ About KQED\n\nKQED, an NPR and PBS affiliate in San Francisco, California, serves Northern California and beyond with a public-supported alternative to commercial TV, radio and web media.\n\nFunding for Deep Look is provided in part by PBS Digital Studios.

The survivors fly off to find mates, and quickly drop their delicate wings to start new underground colonies. If you\u2019re really unlucky, they\u2019ll build tubes of mud and saliva from their nest to yours.\n\nDEEP LOOK is an ultra-HD (4K) short video series created by KQED San Francisco and presented by PBS Digital Studios. See the unseen at the very edge of our visible world. Explore big scientific mysteries by going incredibly small. \n\n---\n\nThese massive swarms of western subterranean termites happen once a year in California on a warm, windless day shortly after the first big rain that ended the dry summer. \n\nWinged termites called alates push through the softened soil. They crawl out of cracks in the road and holes in tree stumps. Big-headed soldier termites stand guard to defend them. \n\nUnderground colonies send these alates up to reproduce with alates from nearby colonies. \n\nOnce a male and female alate find each other, their wings break off. The male runs after the female very quickly, before they both dig themselves into the earth and start their own colony. \n\n---\n\n--- Do all termites fly? \n\nOnly some members of any termite colony can fly. But all types of termites (subterranean, drywood and dampwood) produce alates, whose job it is to fly out and start new colonies.   \n\n--- Do flying termites eat wood? \n\nNo. Once a pair of flying termites have hooked up, they lose their wings, dig underground, mate and lay thousands of eggs. They will be the king and queen of their colony. The worker termites they make will then leave the nest to forage for sources of cellulose, like a dead tree, or wood in a house. When they return to the nest, these workers will feed the colony\u2019s king and queen, as well as the young termites.  \n\n--- Should I worry about flying termites?\n\nIf you see termites flying out inside your house, they could be a sign of infestation. But the more common signs of a subterranean termite infestation are tubes made from earth that worker termites build at the bottom of your house connecting wooden structures to the soil. Termites build these so-called shelter tubes from mud, saliva and even bits of wood or drywall. The insects desiccate easily and need these covered shelter tubes to stay moist.\n\n---+ Find additional resources and a transcript on KQED Science: \nhttps://www.kqed.org/science/1978298/flying-termites-take-a-dangerous-journey-to-a-new-life\n\n---+ More great Deep Look episodes:\n\nThese Termites Turn Your House into a Palace of Poop\nhttps://youtu.be/DYPQ1Tjp0ew\n\nWatch Bed Bugs Get Stopped in Their Tracks\nhttps://youtu.be/ToeWrGTGOOI\n\nA Flea\u2019s Fantastic Jump Takes More Than Muscle\nhttps://youtu.be/A5KvNcNz9aQ\n\n---+ Shoutout!\n\n\ud83c\udfc6Congratulations\ud83c\udfc6 to the first 5 fans on our Deep Look Community Tab to correctly answer our GIF challenge!\n\nNeExtraOleas\nAmber Cooper\nGrace Chen\nViolet A.

                "description": "Take the PBS Digital Studios audience survey! https://to.pbs.org/2021survey\nThe Australian walking stick is a master of deception, but a twig is just one of its many disguises. Before it\u2019s even born, it mimics a seed. In its youth it looks and acts like an ant. Only when it has grown up does it settle into its final, leafy form. Along the way, it fools predators at every turn.\n\nDEEP LOOK is an ultra-HD (4K) short video series created by KQED San Francisco and presented by PBS Digital Studios. See the unseen at the very edge of our visible world. Explore big scientific mysteries by going incredibly small. \n\n\u2014\nThe Australian walking stick (Extatosoma tiaratum) does an amazingly convincing job of looking like a dead leafy branch. Also known as the spiny leaf insect, giant prickly stick insect, or Macleay\u2019s spectre, it has a few extra tricks up its \u201cleaves.\u201d\n\nEven before it is born, it begins a lifetime of deception. The egg looks like a seed that has fallen to the forest floor, with a fatty knob on one end that is irresistible to some foraging ants. These ants take the egg to their underground nest, where they snack on the nutritious cap, leaving the rest of the egg intact.  Over the next few months to a year, the egg is protected underground from predators and develops in the humid, climate-controlled ant burrow.\n\nThe young insect emerges from the ant nest wearing its next disguise \u2013 a red-headed spider ant. This species of ant (Leptomyrmex erythrocephalus) forages for food alone, and are about the same size as the stick insect nymph.   Also the newborn nymph moves quickly, just like the ants do.\n\nThe nymph quickly makes its way into the safety of the trees, and begins to molt. Then, as it matures into adulthood, the Australian stick insect activates its plant costume, using passive camouflage.  During these phases, it sways back-and-forth as it walks.

Like many walking sticks, if no males are around, a female Australian walking stick insect may reproduce, and lay fertile eggs alone. This process is called parthenogenesis, and the offspring are genetic clones of their mothers. \n\n\u2014 Can Australian walking sticks fly?\nAdult males do have functional wings they can use to glide away from threatening situations.\n\n\u2014 How long do Australian walking sticks live?\nAustralian walking sticks live an average of 12 months, but may live longer in captivity.  Between hatching and adulthood, they undergo six moults.

                    "description": "Take the PBS Digital Studios audience survey! https://to.pbs.org/2021survey\nThe Australian walking stick is a master of deception, but a twig is just one of its many disguises. Before it\u2019s even born, it mimics a seed. In its youth it looks and acts like an ant. Only when it has grown up does it settle into its final, leafy form. Along the way, it fools predators at every turn.\n\nDEEP LOOK is an ultra-HD (4K) short video series created by KQED San Francisco and presented by PBS Digital Studios. See the unseen at the very edge of our visible world. Explore big scientific mysteries by going incredibly small. \n\n\u2014\nThe Australian walking stick (Extatosoma tiaratum) does an amazingly convincing job of looking like a dead leafy branch. Also known as the spiny leaf insect, giant prickly stick insect, or Macleay\u2019s spectre, it has a few extra tricks up its \u201cleaves.\u201d\n\nEven before it is born, it begins a lifetime of deception. The egg looks like a seed that has fallen to the forest floor, with a fatty knob on one end that is irresistible to some foraging ants. These ants take the egg to their underground nest, where they snack on the nutritious cap, leaving the rest of the egg intact.  Over the next few months to a year, the egg is protected underground from predators and develops in the humid, climate-controlled ant burrow.\n\nThe young insect emerges from the ant nest wearing its next disguise \u2013 a red-headed spider ant. This species of ant (Leptomyrmex erythrocephalus) forages for food alone, and are about the same size as the stick insect nymph.   Also the newborn nymph moves quickly, just like the ants do.\n\nThe nymph quickly makes its way into the safety of the trees, and begins to molt. Then, as it matures into adulthood, the Australian stick insect activates its plant costume, using passive camouflage.  During these phases, it sways back-and-forth as it walks. Researchers call this imitation of leaves blowing in the wind \u201cactive camouflage.\"\n\n\u2014\n\n\u2014 Do Australian walking stick insects need to mate to have offspring?\nAmazingly, they do not! Like many walking sticks, if no males are around, a female Australian walking stick insect may reproduce, and lay fertile eggs alone. This process is called parthenogenesis, and the offspring are genetic clones of their mothers. \n\n\u2014 Can Australian walking sticks fly?\nAdult males do have functional wings they can use to glide away from threatening situations.\n\n\u2014 How long do Australian walking sticks live?\nAustralian walking sticks live an average of 12 months, but may live longer in captivity.  Between hatching and adulthood, they undergo six moults.  The wings on adult males only appear after the final moult.\n\n\u2014\n\n---+ Find additional resources and a transcript on KQED Science:\nhttps://www.kqed.org/science/1978180/australian-walking-stick-insects-are-three-times-weirder-than-you-think/\n\n---+ More great Deep Look episodes:\n\nThese Giant Leaf Insects Will Sway Your Heart | Deep Look\nhttps://youtu.be/QjPInsEYDLs\n\nWalking Sticks Stop, Drop and Clone to Survive | Deep Look\nhttps://youtu.be/Nxs0Q7ktaKU\n\nKidnapper Ants Steal Other Ants' Babies - And Brainwash Them | Deep Look\nhttps://youtu.be/sC4MjPKf3jY\n\n---+ Shoutout!\n\n\ud83c\udfc6Congratulations\ud83c\udfc6 to the following  fans on our Deep Look Community Tab for correctly answering our Community Tab GIF challenge!\n\nTheresa Calovini\nAhmet Kerem\nDuncan\nGavin Rushing\nAragon\n\n---+ Thank you to our Top Patreon Supporters ($10+ per month)!\n\nJessica\nChris B Emrick\nBurt Humburg\nDavid Deshpande\nKaren Reynolds\nDaisuke Goto\nAdam Kurtz\nAllison & Maka Masuda\nWild Turkey\nTianxing Wang\nCompanion Cube\nNathan Jewsbury\nJosh Kuroda\nMark Jobes\nKevin Judge\nBlanca Vides\nmonoirre \nAnastasia Grinkevic\nSupernovabetty \nRoberta K Wright\nTitania Juang\nAurora \nSyniurge \nAdmiralShadow\nKW \nEl Samuels\nCarrie Mukaida\nJellyman\nMehdi\nRick Wong\nKristy Freeman\nCristen Rasmussen\nEd Gandia\nMary Truland\nNicky O.\nKelly Hong\nScott Faunce\nCindy McGill\nSueEllen McCann\nNicolette Ray\nLaurel Przybylski\nLouis O'Neill\nNoreen Herrington\nShelley Pearson Cranshaw\nSonia Tanlimco\nMisia Clive\nCaitlin McDonough\nWade Tregaskis\nSilvan\nShonara Rivas \nElizabeth Ann Ditz\nJoshua Murallon Robertson\nLevi Cai\nTierZoo \nDelphine Tseng\nrafael pirondi\n\n---+ Follow KQED Science and Deep Look:\n \nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/kqedscience/\u200b \nTwitter: https://www.twitter.com/kqedscience\u200b \n\n---+ About KQED \n\nKQED, an NPR and PBS affiliate in San Francisco, California, serves Northern California and beyond with a public-supported alternative to commercial TV, radio and web media. \n\nFunding for Deep Look is provided in part by PBS Digital Studios.

                "description": "They might look like harmless grasshoppers, but locusts have an appetite for destruction. When the conditions are right, they transform from mild-mannered loners into gregarious partiers. They swarm, causing chaos and suffering at the level of a biblical plague. So what sets them off?\n\nWATCH the companion episode from our pal Dr. Emily Zarka of PBS Monstrum, on the origins of 'Big Bug' science fiction: https://youtu.be/8wws89pdCDY\n\nDEEP LOOK is an ultra-HD (4K) short video series created by KQED San Francisco and presented by PBS Digital Studios. See the unseen at the very edge of our visible world. Explore big scientific mysteries by going incredibly small.\n\n---\n\u201cLocusts are certainly immensely fascinating creatures,\u201d says Rick Overson, a research scientist for Arizona State University\u2019s Global Locust Initiative.  \u201cGrowing up in the Phoenix Valley, my parents called noisy cicadas locusts. But to a biologist, the locust is a special type of grasshopper.\n\nThey have this really fantastic ability to respond in a way that we call phenotypic plasticity. If the conditions are one way, they can become what we consider a normal, solitary grasshopper that's camouflaged green, goes relatively unnoticed and avoids other members of its species. \n\nBut then when conditions are right, which a lot of times is rain falling in the desert and producing a lot of food, those locusts then can do this switch and move down a different developmental pathway and their coloration changes, their neurochemistry changes, their behavior changes and they become attracted to one another. They begin to march in these coordinated formations.\u201d \n\n--- Why do locusts swarm? \nLocusts swarm as a reaction to being crowded together. That can happen in different ways, but one common way is when drought reduces the amount of surrounding vegetation and the locusts get concentrated on the remaining plants.\n\n--- How long do locusts live?\nThere is variation between species and between individuals within a species, but many species like desert locusts live about three to five months.\n\n--- Do locusts bite?\nLocusts generally don\u2019t bite people, though they may be able to give a little nibble in defense. Like other grasshoppers, locusts will typically try to leap away from danger. If that doesn\u2019t work they can kick with their powerful hind legs. They also have the ability to regurgitate partially digested food and enzymes at their attacker. The dark unpleasant substance is referred to as \u201ctobacco juice.\u201d\n\n---+ Find additional resources and a transcript on KQED Science:\nhttps://www.kqed.org/science/1977743/these-swarming-locusts-are-grasshoppers-gone-wrong\n \nThe Global Locust Initiative (GLI): https://sustainability-innovation.asu.edu/global-locust-initiative/\n \n---+ More great Deep Look episodes:\n\nWhy Crickets Just Won't Shut Up | Deep Look\nhttps://youtu.be/fh3uNUrAnss\n\nSkeleton Shrimp Use 18 Appendages to Feed, Fight and ...

                    "description": "They might look like harmless grasshoppers, but locusts have an appetite for destruction. When the conditions are right, they transform from mild-mannered loners into gregarious partiers. They swarm, causing chaos and suffering at the level of a biblical plague. So what sets them off?\n\nWATCH the companion episode from our pal Dr. Emily Zarka of PBS Monstrum, on the origins of 'Big Bug' science fiction: https://youtu.be/8wws89pdCDY\n\nDEEP LOOK is an ultra-HD (4K) short video series created by KQED San Francisco and presented by PBS Digital Studios. See the unseen at the very edge of our visible world. Explore big scientific mysteries by going incredibly small.\n\n---\n\u201cLocusts are certainly immensely fascinating creatures,\u201d says Rick Overson, a research scientist for Arizona State University\u2019s Global Locust Initiative.  \u201cGrowing up in the Phoenix Valley, my parents called noisy cicadas locusts. But to a biologist, the locust is a special type of grasshopper.\n\nThey have this really fantastic ability to respond in a way that we call phenotypic plasticity. If the conditions are one way, they can become what we consider a normal, solitary grasshopper that's camouflaged green, goes relatively unnoticed and avoids other members of its species. \n\nBut then when conditions are right, which a lot of times is rain falling in the desert and producing a lot of food, those locusts then can do this switch and move down a different developmental pathway and their coloration changes, their neurochemistry changes, their behavior changes and they become attracted to one another. They begin to march in these coordinated formations.\u201d \n\n--- Why do locusts swarm? \nLocusts swarm as a reaction to being crowded together. That can happen in different ways, but one common way is when drought reduces the amount of surrounding vegetation and the locusts get concentrated on the remaining plants.\n\n--- How long do locusts live?\nThere is variation between species and between individuals within a species, but many species like desert locusts live about three to five months.\n\n--- Do locusts bite?\nLocusts generally don\u2019t bite people, though they may be able to give a little nibble in defense. Like other grasshoppers, locusts will typically try to leap away from danger. If that doesn\u2019t work they can kick with their powerful hind legs. They also have the ability to regurgitate partially digested food and enzymes at their attacker. The dark unpleasant substance is referred to as \u201ctobacco juice.\u201d\n\n---+ Find additional resources and a transcript on KQED Science:\nhttps://www.kqed.org/science/1977743/these-swarming-locusts-are-grasshoppers-gone-wrong\n \nThe Global Locust Initiative (GLI): https://sustainability-innovation.asu.edu/global-locust-initiative/\n \n---+ More great Deep Look episodes:\n\nWhy Crickets Just Won't Shut Up | Deep Look\nhttps://youtu.be/fh3uNUrAnss\n\nSkeleton Shrimp Use 18 Appendages to Feed, Fight and ...

Explore big scientific mysteries by going incredibly small.\n\nKissing bugs live in the Americas, where around 130 species feed on humans, wild animals like wood rats, and on dogs, chickens and pigs. \n\nIn Latin America, five species of kissing bugs are largely responsible for infecting around 6 million people with the parasite Trypanosoma cruzi that causes Chagas disease. The parasite enters people\u2019s bodies when they rub the poop of an infected kissing bug into the bite wound or their eyes.\n\nMost never get sick, but up to one-third develop heart disease that can kill them. Pregnant women can pass the parasite onto their babies.\n\n--- What are signs you\u2019ve been bitten by a kissing bug?\nThe bite is painless and frequently invisible, though it might swell up. Kissing bugs often bite near the eyes or mouth, but they\u2019ll dig in anywhere. \n\nIf the bite victim rubs infected bug poop into their eye, it might puff up into the sign of Roma\u00f1a. \n\nInfection might cause fever, headache, cough, or abdominal pain, according to the Pan American Health Organization. \n\n--- What are other names for kissing bugs?\nThey\u2019re referred to as triatomines and also known as chinche besucona, vinchuca, pito and barbeiro.\n\n--- In what countries do people contract Chagas?\nChagas is regularly transmitted in 21 countries in Latin America. \n\nIn the U.S., where kissing bugs very rarely transmit Chagas, researchers estimate that some 350,000 Latin American immigrants contracted the parasite in their home countries, where the bugs live inside houses and in animal coops.\n\n--- What is the treatment for Chagas?\nTwo medications can kill the parasite. \n\n\u201cThe earlier you treat people, and the younger the person is, the better the chance of preventing development of heart disease,\u201d said Dr. Caryn Bern, at the University of California, San Francisco.    \n\n--- In what states in the U.S. do kissing bugs live?\nTexas, New Mexico and Arizona are the states with the most findings of kissing bugs, according to Texas A&M University. \n\n---+ Find additional resources and a transcript on KQED Science: https://www.kqed.org/science/1977520/how-a-kissing-bug-becomes-a-balloon-full-of-your-blood\n\n---+ More great Deep Look episodes: \n\nWatch Bed Bugs Get Stopped in Their Tracks\nhttps://youtu.be/ToeWrGTGOOI\n\nHow Ticks Dig in With a Mouth Full of Hooks\nhttps://youtu.be/_IoOJu2_FKE\n\nHow Mosquitoes Use Six Needles to Suck Your Blood\nhttps://youtu.be/rD8SmacBUcU\n\n---+ Shoutout!\n\n\ud83c\udfc6Congratulations\ud83c\udfc6 to the following  fans on our Deep Look Community Tab for correctly answering our GIF challenge!\n\nbless up thank u\nEmmett\nMatthew Nardin\nGavin Rushing\nWill Smith\n\n\n---+ Thank you to our Top Patreon Supporters ($10+ per month)!\n\nShonara Rivas \nJessica\nmark tighe\nEd Gandia\nMehdi\nMark Jobes\nDelphine Tseng\nNicky O.\nJana Brenning \nAnastasia Grinkevic\nAllison & Maka Masuda\nNathan Jewsbury\nWild Turkey\nCarrie Mukaida\nScott Faunce\nTianxing Wang\nKelly Hong\nMisia Clive\nKevin Judge\nCristen Rasmussen\nTeresa Lavell\nWade Tregaskis\nJosh Kuroda\nBurt Humburg\nCaitlin McDonough\nBlanca Vides\nCarlos Carrasco\nNoreen Herrington\nKristy Freeman\nMary Truland\nRoberta K Wright\nSyniurge \nAurora \nSilvan\nmonoirre \nLeonhardt Wille\nLouis O'Neill\nJellyman\nTitania Juang\nRick Wong\nSonia Tanlimco\nCindy McGill\nNicolette Ray\nJoshua Murallon Robertson\nAdam Kurtz\nEl Samuels\nLaurel Przybylski\nSupernovabetty \nCompanion Cube\nChris B Emrick\nKW \nchckncurry\nKaren Reynolds\nTierZoo \nSueEllen McCann\nDavid Deshpande\nShelley Pearson Cranshaw\nDaisuke Goto\nElizabeth Ann Ditz\nLevi Cai\n\n\n---+ Follow KQED Science and Deep Look:\n \nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/kqedscience/\nTwitter: https://www.twitter.com/kqedscience\n\n---+ About KQED\n\nKQED, an NPR and PBS affiliate in San Francisco, California, serves Northern California and beyond with a public-supported alternative to commercial TV, radio and web media.\n\nFunding for Deep Look is provided in part by PBS Digital Studios.

                "description": "Under the bright yellow petals of a tarweed plant, an insect known as the assassin bug kills its caterpillar victim by stabbing it over and over. But does this perpetrator have an accomplice? Sticky droplets all over the plant could be a clue.\n\nSUBSCRIBE to Deep Look! http://goo.gl/8NwXqt \nPlease join our community on Patreon! https://www.patreon.com/deeplook\n\n---+ Why is an assassin bug called an assassin bug? \nLikely because it impales its insect and arachnid victims with its pointy mouthparts.\n\n---+ Is an assassin bug the same thing as a kissing bug?\nNo. Assassin bugs and kissing bugs are relatives, but they\u2019re different from each other. They\u2019re both part of a large family of insects called reduviids, known as the \u201cassassin bug\u201d family, hence part of the confusion. Kissing bugs and assassin bugs look similar to each other in that they have long mouthparts that they keep folded under their head when they\u2019re not using them.\n\nBut they\u2019re different from each other in their feeding habits. Assassin bugs, which are found around the world, live on plants and feed mainly on insects, for example, moth caterpillars and beetles and beetle larvae. \n\nKissing bugs make up a group of 150 species known as triatomines and found mainly in the Americas. Kissing bugs feed on the blood of humans, as well as that of many other domestic and wild mammals and birds. These insects can transmit a parasite through their feces that causes Chagas disease. The parasite, Trypanosoma cruzi, may live inside the body for many years without causing health problems, but it damages the heart and digestive systems of 20% to 30% of infected people and can be deadly.\n\nEven though its feces can make you sick, the bite of a kissing bug is usually painless, since the parasite injects chemicals so that it can feed undisturbed for several minutes. But a kissing bug\u2019s bite can sometimes cause anaphylaxis, a severe allergic reaction that leads to shortness of breath, shock and death, if left unattended. An assassin bug\u2019s stab, if you\u2019re unlucky enough to step on one or you pick one up by mistake, *will* hurt. And both assassin bug and kissing bug bites can be itchy.\n\n---+ What are an assassin bug\u2019s mouthparts called? \nAssassin bugs\u2019 mouthparts are often referred to as the rostrum or beak. \n\n---+ Is there anything good about the assassin bug?\nYes! Assassin bugs can help control agricultural and garden pests.\n\n---+ Find a transcript on KQED Science: https://www.kqed.org/science/1976834/you-cant-unsee-the-assassin-bugs-dirty-work\n\n---+ More great Deep Look episodes: \n\nThese Hairworms Eat a Cricket Alive and Control Its Mind\nhttps://youtu.be/YB6O7jS_VBM\n\nThis Killer Fungus Turns Flies into Zombies\nhttps://youtu.be/C2Jw5ib-s_I\n\nBorn Pregnant: Aphids Invade with an Onslaught of Clones\nhttps://youtu.be/vrzalLssomg\n\nLeaf Miner Fly Babies Scribble All Over Your Salad\nhttps://youtu.be/QtbjUB4AnLI\n\n---+ Shoutout!\n\n\ud83c\udfc6Congratulations\ud83c\udfc6 to the following 5 fans on our Deep Look Community Tab for correctly answering our GIF challenge!\n\nDansu18\nKaiser Yuan\nMalcom Clarance\nFeelsbad\nBill Nabila\n\n\n---+ Thank you to our Top Patreon Supporters ($10+ per month)!\n\nChris B Emrick\nBurt Humburg\nDavid Deshpande\nKaren Reynolds\nDaisuke Goto\nAdam Kurtz\nAllison & Maka Masuda\ndane rosseter\nKaleb Kuan\nNathan Jewsbury\nCompanion Cube\nTianxing Wang\nJosh Kuroda\nWild Turkey\nNeil Jeyasingam\nMark Jobes\nBlanca Vides\nCindy McGill\nKevin Judge\nTitania Juang\nAnastasia Grinkevic\nAurora \nRoberta K Wright\nSupernovabetty \nKW \nSyniurge \nmonoirre \nLeonhardt Wille\nCarrie Mukaida\nEl Samuels\nGerardo Alfaro\nNicky O.\nMehdi\nEd Gandia\nScott Faunce\nKristy Freeman\nCristen Rasmussen\nVivek Singh\nRick Wong\nSonia Tanlimco\nMisia Clive\nKallie Moore\nMary Truland\nKelly Hong\nCarlos Carrasco\nSueEllen McCann\nNicolette Ray\nCaitlin McDonough\nNoreen Herrington\nLouis O'Neill\nShelley Pearson Cranshaw\nTeresa Lavell\nLaurel Przybylski\nLevi Cai\nSilvan\nJoshua Murallon Robertson\nTierZoo \nElizabeth Ann Ditz\nDelphine Tseng\nJana Brenning \nchckncurry\n\n\n---+ Follow KQED Science and Deep Look: \nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/kqedscience/ \nTwitter: https://www.twitter.com/kqedscience \n\n---+ About KQED \nKQED, an NPR and PBS affiliate in San Francisco, California, serves Northern California and beyond with a public-supported alternative to commercial TV, radio and web media.

                    "title": "You Can\u2019t Unsee the Assassin Bug\u2019s Dirty Work | Deep Look",
                    "description": "Under the bright yellow petals of a tarweed plant, an insect known as the assassin bug kills its caterpillar victim by stabbing it over and over. But does this perpetrator have an accomplice? Sticky droplets all over the plant could be a clue.\n\nSUBSCRIBE to Deep Look! http://goo.gl/8NwXqt \nPlease join our community on Patreon! https://www.patreon.com/deeplook\n\n---+ Why is an assassin bug called an assassin bug? \nLikely because it impales its insect and arachnid victims with its pointy mouthparts.\n\n---+ Is an assassin bug the same thing as a kissing bug?\nNo. Assassin bugs and kissing bugs are relatives, but they\u2019re different from each other. They\u2019re both part of a large family of insects called reduviids, known as the \u201cassassin bug\u201d family, hence part of the confusion. Kissing bugs and assassin bugs look similar to each other in that they have long mouthparts that they keep folded under their head when they\u2019re not using them.\n\nBut they\u2019re different from each other in their feeding habits. Assassin bugs, which are found around the world, live on plants and feed mainly on insects, for example, moth caterpillars and beetles and beetle larvae. \n\nKissing bugs make up a group of 150 species known as triatomines and found mainly in the Americas. Kissing bugs feed on the blood of humans, as well as that of many other domestic and wild mammals and birds. These insects can transmit a parasite through their feces that causes Chagas disease. The parasite, Trypanosoma cruzi, may live inside the body for many years without causing health problems, but it damages the heart and digestive systems of 20% to 30% of infected people and can be deadly.\n\nEven though its feces can make you sick, the bite of a kissing bug is usually painless, since the parasite injects chemicals so that it can feed undisturbed for several minutes. But a kissing bug\u2019s bite can sometimes cause anaphylaxis, a severe allergic reaction that leads to shortness of breath, shock and death, if left unattended. An assassin bug\u2019s stab, if you\u2019re unlucky enough to step on one or you pick one up by mistake, *will* hurt. And both assassin bug and kissing bug bites can be itchy.\n\n---+ What are an assassin bug\u2019s mouthparts called? \nAssassin bugs\u2019 mouthparts are often referred to as the rostrum or beak. \n\n---+ Is there anything good about the assassin bug?\nYes! Assassin bugs can help control agricultural and garden pests.\n\n---+ Find a transcript on KQED Science: https://www.kqed.org/science/1976834/you-cant-unsee-the-assassin-bugs-dirty-work\n\n---+ More great Deep Look episodes: \n\nThese Hairworms Eat a Cricket Alive and Control Its Mind\nhttps://youtu.be/YB6O7jS_VBM\n\nThis Killer Fungus Turns Flies into Zombies\nhttps://youtu.be/C2Jw5ib-s_I\n\nBorn Pregnant: Aphids Invade with an Onslaught of Clones\nhttps://youtu.be/vrzalLssomg\n\nLeaf Miner Fly Babies Scribble All Over Your Salad\nhttps://youtu.be/QtbjUB4AnLI\n\n---+ Shoutout!\n\n\ud83c\udfc6Congratulations\ud83c\udfc6 to the following 5 fans on our Deep Look Community Tab for correctly answering our GIF challenge!\n\nDansu18\nKaiser Yuan\nMalcom Clarance\nFeelsbad\nBill Nabila\n\n\n---+ Thank you to our Top Patreon Supporters ($10+ per month)!\n\nChris B Emrick\nBurt Humburg\nDavid Deshpande\nKaren Reynolds\nDaisuke Goto\nAdam Kurtz\nAllison & Maka Masuda\ndane rosseter\nKaleb Kuan\nNathan Jewsbury\nCompanion Cube\nTianxing Wang\nJosh Kuroda\nWild Turkey\nNeil Jeyasingam\nMark Jobes\nBlanca Vides\nCindy McGill\nKevin Judge\nTitania Juang\nAnastasia Grinkevic\nAurora \nRoberta K Wright\nSupernovabetty \nKW \nSyniurge \nmonoirre \nLeonhardt Wille\nCarrie Mukaida\nEl Samuels\nGerardo Alfaro\nNicky O.\nMehdi\nEd Gandia\nScott Faunce\nKristy Freeman\nCristen Rasmussen\nVivek Singh\nRick Wong\nSonia Tanlimco\nMisia Clive\nKallie Moore\nMary Truland\nKelly Hong\nCarlos Carrasco\nSueEllen McCann\nNicolette Ray\nCaitlin McDonough\nNoreen Herrington\nLouis O'Neill\nShelley Pearson Cranshaw\nTeresa Lavell\nLaurel Przybylski\nLevi Cai\nSilvan\nJoshua Murallon Robertson\nTierZoo \nElizabeth Ann Ditz\nDelphine Tseng\nJana Brenning \nchckncurry\n\n\n---+ Follow KQED Science and Deep Look: \nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/kqedscience/ \nTwitter: https://www.twitter.com/kqedscience \n\n---+ About KQED \nKQED, an NPR and PBS affiliate in San Francisco, California, serves Northern California and beyond with a public-supported alternative to commercial TV, radio and web media.

See the unseen at the very edge of our visible world. Explore big scientific mysteries by going incredibly small. \n\n---\nThe San Francisco forktail damselfly fits right in, in its hometown \u2013 a city that has long-attracted dreamers, misfits and lovers. Unlike most other damselfly species, the San Francisco forktail has uniquely adapted to the cooler, foggy conditions here, evolving a darker, more robust body, and a tolerance for colder weather. There are thousands of species of damselflies and their dragonfly cousins - a family of flying insects called odonates \u2013 but the San Francisco forktail is currently considered one the rarest in North America.\n\n Living in the city comes with obvious challenges for any wild animal trying to maintain its wild habitat. This rare and beautiful insect faces the perils of climate change and habitat loss, as well as hybridization with other local species.  As the years go by, a warming climate means less of their beloved cool fog.  \n\nScientists at the San Francisco Zoo are working with ecologists from the Presidio Trust to re-establish the San Francisco forktail.  \n\n--- \n\n--- What\u2019s the difference between a damselfly and a dragonfly?\nDamselflies and dragonflies are both odonates, a group of flying insects, but there are ways to tell them apart. Damselflies are typically more slender-bodied than their thicker, more robust dragonfly cousins.  When they are at rest, damselflies usually fold their wings neatly behind themselves, and dragonflies keep their wings outstretched. Also, the two compound damselfly eyes are spaced apart, while dragonfly compound eyes are larger and connected in the middle.\n\n--- What is a baby damselfly called?\nJust like their dragonfly cousins, young damselfly nymphs are called naiads, and they spend the first phase of their lives living underwater. Naiads breathe through caudal gills that look like leafy appendages on their backsides. This phase of life can last from two months to more than a year, depending on species, water temperature and food availability.\n\n--- What do damselflies eat?\nAdult damselflies, like all odonates, eat flies, mosquitoes and other small insects, playing an important role in the food web (and keeping those mosquito numbers in check for us humans).  They hover among small grasses and low vegetation, ambushing their prey.\n\n---+ More great Deep Look episodes:\n\nA Baby Dragonfly's Mouth Will Give You Nightmares | Deep Look\nhttps://youtu.be/EHo_9wnnUTE\n\nHere\u2019s How That Annoying Fly Dodges Your Swatter | Deep Look\nhttps://youtu.be/jBPFCvEhv9Y\n\n---+ Shoutout!\n\n\ud83c\udfc6Congratulations\ud83c\udfc6 to the following 5 fans on our Deep Look Community Tab \n\n\ud83c\udfc6Congratulations\ud83c\udfc6 to the following 5 fans on our Deep Look Community Tab for correctly answering our GIF challenge!\n\nZoo Emperor\nWouter van der Voort\nThomas Rivers\nAnonymous\nJed Laroya\n\n---+ Thank you to our Top Patreon Supporters ($10+ per month)!\n\nChris B Emrick\nBurt Humburg\nDavid Deshpande\nKaren Reynolds\nDaisuke Goto\nAdam Kurtz\nAllison & Maka Masuda\ndane rosseter\nKaleb Kuan\nNathan Jewsbury\nCompanion Cube\nTianxing Wang\nJosh Kuroda\nWild Turkey\nNeil Jeyasingam\nMark Jobes\nBlanca Vides\nCindy McGill\nKevin Judge\nTitania Juang\nAnastasia Grinkevic\nAurora \nRoberta K Wright\nSupernovabetty \nKW \nSyniurge \nmonoirre \nLeonhardt Wille\nCarrie Mukaida\nEl Samuels\nGerardo Alfaro\nNicky O.\nMehdi\nEd Gandia\nScott Faunce\nKristy Freeman\nCristen Rasmussen\nVivek Singh\nRick Wong\nSonia Tanlimco\nMisia Clive\nKallie Moore\nMary Truland\nKelly Hong\nCarlos Carrasco\nSueEllen McCann\nNicolette Ray\nCaitlin McDonough\nNoreen Herrington\nLouis O'Neill\nShelley Pearson Cranshaw\nTeresa Lavell\nLaurel Przybylski\nLevi Cai\nSilvan\nJoshua Murallon Robertson\nTierZoo \nElizabeth Ann Ditz\nDelphine Tseng\nJana Brenning \nchckncurry\n\n---+ Follow KQED Science and Deep Look:\n \nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/kqedscience/\u200b \nTwitter: https://www.twitter.com/kqedscience\u200b \n\n---+ About KQED \n\nKQED, an NPR and PBS affiliate in San Francisco, California, serves Northern California and beyond with a public-supported alternative to commercial TV, radio and web media. \n\nFunding for Deep Look is provided in part by PBS Digital Studios.

But they aren\u2019t picky, they\u2019ll eat other things like small fish and different crustaceans. \n\n--- Why do horseshoe crabs lay their eggs on land?\nBy laying their eggs in the damp sand, they protect their eggs from the many predators that live in the sea. It allows their offspring a chance to develop before another high tide carries them into the sea.\n\n--- Why do horseshoe crabs have blue blood?\nLike other mollusks, horseshoe crabs have blood that carries oxygen using a copper-containing protein called hemocyanin. The hemocyanin turns blue when exposed to oxygen. Vertebrates like humans have iron-containing hemoglobin in their blood, causing it to turn red when exposed to oxygen. \n\n---+ Find additional resources and a transcript on KQED Science:\nhttps://www.kqed.org/science/1976488/once-a-spawn-a-time-horseshoe-crabs-mob-the-beach\n \n\n---+ More great Deep Look episodes:\n\nThese Fish Are All About Sex on the Beach | Deep Look\nhttps://youtu.be/j5F3z1iP0Ic\n\nFor Pacific Mole Crabs It's Dig or Die | Deep Look\nhttps://youtu.be/tfoYD8pAsMw\n\nDecorator Crabs Make High Fashion at Low Tide | Deep Look\nhttps://youtu.be/OwQcv7TyX04\n\n---+ Shoutout!\n\n\ud83c\udfc6Congratulations\ud83c\udfc6 to the following 5 fans on our Deep Look Community Tab for correctly answering that the body part a male horseshoe crabs use to grab onto their mates is a clasper, a modified pedipalp!\n\nSinister Omen\nSARA FATIMA\nAnirudh Anilkumar\nUwis Qurni Abdullah\nhudson urruttia\n\n---+ Thank you to our Top Patreon Supporters ($10+ per month)!\n\nChris B Emrick\nBurt Humburg\nDavid Deshpande\nKaren Reynolds\nDaisuke Goto\nAdam Kurtz\nAllison & Maka Masuda\ndane rosseter\nWild Turkey\nBerian James\nNathan Jewsbury\nCompanion Cube\nTianxing Wang\nJosh Kuroda\nMark Jobes\nCindy McGill\nBlanca Vides\nKevin Judge\nJana Brenning \nSupernovabetty \nTitania Juang\nAurora \nAnastasia Grinkevic\nmonoirre \nRoberta K Wright\nLeonhardt Wille\nSyniurge \nRick Wong\nKW \nCarrie Mukaida\nEl Samuels\nMehdi\nKristy Freeman\nGerardo Alfaro\nNicky O.\nMary Truland\nCristen Rasmussen\nScott Faunce\nEd Gandia\nSueEllen McCann\nJeremiah Sullivan\nNoreen Herrington\nKelly Hong\nMisia Clive\nShelley Pearson Cranshaw\nSonia Tanlimco\nKallie Moore\nTeresa Lavell\nNicolette Ray\nLaurel Przybylski\nLouis O'Neill\nCarlos Carrasco\nCaitlin McDonough\nDelphine Tseng\nElizabeth Ann Ditz\nJoshua Murallon Robertson\nLevi Cai\nTierZoo \nSilvan\nchckncurry\n\n---+ Follow KQED Science and Deep Look:\n \nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/kqedscience/\nTwitter: https://www.twitter.com/kqedscience\n\n---+ About KQED\n\nKQED, an NPR and PBS affiliate in San Francisco, California, serves Northern California and beyond with a public-supported alternative to commercial TV, radio and web media.\n\nFunding for Deep Look is provided in part by PBS Digital Studios.

                "title": "The Axolotl Salamander Doesn\u2019t Wanna Grow Up | Deep Look",
                "description": "Native to the lakes of Mexico City, the axolotl stays in the water its whole life, swimming with a tail fin and breathing through frilly external gills. It\u2019s nearly extinct in the wild, but survives in research labs the world over, studied for its amazing regenerative abilities. With our help, can these beloved creatures thrive once again in their ancestral home?\n\nSUBSCRIBE to Deep Look! http://goo.gl/8NwXqt\u200b \nGo watch Animal IQ, on PBS Terra! : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDrBsr_KdVw&list=PLnNZYWyBGJ1EwEssKD7m6YN5gjYHxVNQN\n\n---\n\nThe axolotl (Ambystoma mexicanum) is an aquatic salamander that basically never wants to grow up. It grows in size as it matures, but unlike most of its close cousins in the mole salamander family, it does not change into a land-dwelling adult. For its entire life, it lives in the water, retaining its larval characteristics \u2013 like external gills and a tailfin, used for swimming.  \n\nNow, the few remaining wild axolotls left in the world live in the middle of Mexico City, in the canals that are the remnants of their native Lake Xochimilco.  Here, for over 800 years, the animal has represented a bridge between humans and the natural world. The name \u201caxolotl\u201d comes from the Nahuatl Aztec language meaning \u201cwater dog.\u201d For the Aztecs, this swimming salamander is one of the spirit animal forms of the Aztec god Xolotl, who is associated with lighting and death, and imbued with powers of physical transformation.  \n\nMexico City was built around, and on top of, a large network of spring-fed lakes over the hundreds of years of its existence. The lakes were drained and filled in over time, as the millions of people made the city their home. \n\n--- How do axolotls breathe?\nThe signature frills behind the axolotl\u2019s head are its external gills.  The fine, branched structure of these exposed gills allows more surface area to be exposed to absorb oxygen from the water. To breathe, an axolotl just needs to flap those external gills!  That\u2019s not all - these animals have even more ways they can breathe. Like all other salamanders, axolotls are able to absorb oxygen through their skin. Plus, they have fully functional lungs they can use if there is not enough oxygen in the water.

                    "title": "The Axolotl Salamander Doesn\u2019t Wanna Grow Up | Deep Look",
                    "description": "Native to the lakes of Mexico City, the axolotl stays in the water its whole life, swimming with a tail fin and breathing through frilly external gills. It\u2019s nearly extinct in the wild, but survives in research labs the world over, studied for its amazing regenerative abilities. With our help, can these beloved creatures thrive once again in their ancestral home?\n\nSUBSCRIBE to Deep Look! http://goo.gl/8NwXqt\u200b \nGo watch Animal IQ, on PBS Terra! : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDrBsr_KdVw&list=PLnNZYWyBGJ1EwEssKD7m6YN5gjYHxVNQN\n\n---\n\nThe axolotl (Ambystoma mexicanum) is an aquatic salamander that basically never wants to grow up. It grows in size as it matures, but unlike most of its close cousins in the mole salamander family, it does not change into a land-dwelling adult. For its entire life, it lives in the water, retaining its larval characteristics \u2013 like external gills and a tailfin, used for swimming.  \n\nNow, the few remaining wild axolotls left in the world live in the middle of Mexico City, in the canals that are the remnants of their native Lake Xochimilco.  Here, for over 800 years, the animal has represented a bridge between humans and the natural world. The name \u201caxolotl\u201d comes from the Nahuatl Aztec language meaning \u201cwater dog.\u201d For the Aztecs, this swimming salamander is one of the spirit animal forms of the Aztec god Xolotl, who is associated with lighting and death, and imbued with powers of physical transformation.  \n\nMexico City was built around, and on top of, a large network of spring-fed lakes over the hundreds of years of its existence. The lakes were drained and filled in over time, as the millions of people made the city their home. \n\n--- How do axolotls breathe?\nThe signature frills behind the axolotl\u2019s head are its external gills.  The fine, branched structure of these exposed gills allows more surface area to be exposed to absorb oxygen from the water. To breathe, an axolotl just needs to flap those external gills!  That\u2019s not all - these animals have even more ways they can breathe. Like all other salamanders, axolotls are able to absorb oxygen through their skin. Plus, they have fully functional lungs they can use if there is not enough oxygen in the water. NOTE to axolotl pet owners: Despite having working lungs, the animals will not survive for more than a few hours out of water.\n\n--- Is the axolotl immortal?\n\nNo, axolotls are not immortal, but they do possess extraordinary powers of limb and organ regeneration. If these aquatic amphibians lose a leg, tail or even parts of their spinal cord or brain, they can regrow the missing piece. There are other animals that can regenerate organs and limbs, but the axolotl is one of very few vertebrates (animals with backbones - like us) that is able to do this.  \n\n---+ Find additional resources and a transcript on KQED Science:\n\nhttps://www.kqed.org/science/1975648/the-axolotl-salamander-doesnt-wanna-grow-up\n\n---+ Shoutout!\n\n\ud83c\udfc6Congratulations\ud83c\udfc6 to the following fans on our Deep Look Community Tab for correctly answering our GIF challenge, that nerve cells are needed  to begin any regenerative process for axolotls. \n\nBigode\n\n---+ Thank you to our Top Patreon Supporters ($10+ per month)!\n\nChris B Emrick\nAlex\nBurt Humburg\nKaren Reynolds\nWild Turkey\nBerian James\nJosh Kuroda\ndane rosseter\nDavid Deshpande\nDaisuke Goto\nCompanion Cube\nAllison & Maka Masuda\nAdam Kurtz\nNathan Jewsbury\nTianxing Wang\nMark Jobes\nKelly Hong\nLeonhardt Wille\nLaurel Przybylski\nElizabeth Ann Ditz\nJoshua Murallon Robertson\nKevin Judge\nMary Truland\nGerardo Alfaro\nEl Samuels\nSonia Tanlimco\nCarrie Mukaida\nSupernovabetty \nShelley Pearson Cranshaw\nRoberta K Wright\nmonoirre \nSilvan\nAurora \nLevi Cai\nMisia Clive\nEd Gandia\nKristy Freeman\nRick Wong\nTitania Juang\nCarlos Carrasco\nCaitlin McDonough\nNicky O.\nBlanca Vides\nCristen Rasmussen\nSyniurge \nNicolette Ray\nDelphine Tseng\nTeresa Lavell\nSueEllen McCann\nScott Faunce\nKallie Moore\nJana Brenning \nCindy McGill\nNoreen Herrington\nLouis O'Neill\nMehdi\nAnastasia Grinkevic\nKW \nTierZoo \n\n---+ Follow KQED Science and Deep Look:\n \nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/kqedscience/\u200b \nTwitter: https://www.twitter.com/kqedscience\u200b \n\n---+ About KQED \n\nKQED, an NPR and PBS affiliate in San Francisco, California, serves Northern California and beyond with a public-supported alternative to commercial TV, radio and web media. \n\nFunding for Deep Look is provided in part by PBS Digital Studios.

                "description": "Hermit crabs are *obsessed* with snail shells. These crafty little crabs, found in California's rocky intertidal zone, are more than happy to let the snails build them a perfect home. When the crabs find a snail shell they like, they hop right into their new abode.\n\nSUBSCRIBE to Deep Look! http://goo.gl/8NwXqt\nPlease join our community on Patreon! https://www.patreon.com/deeplook\n\nDEEP LOOK is an ultra-HD (4K) short video series created by KQED San Francisco and presented by PBS Digital Studios. See the unseen at the very edge of our visible world. Explore big scientific mysteries by going incredibly small.\n\n---\nHermit crabs are one of the most recognizable and adored inhabitants of tide pools. But they aren\u2019t just cute (for a crab).\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re one of the most important creatures in the intertidal zone because of their role as scavengers,\u201d said Stephen Dunbar, a professor of biology at Loma Linda University. \u201cThey begin the process of cleaning up dead materials, like dead seaweed, fish, crabs, snails or whatever else.\u201d\n\nWhile hermit crabs scavenge for food, they also keep an eye out for new shells to call home.\n\nGrainyhand hermit crabs seem to prefer turban snail shells. That\u2019s good because turban snails are incredibly abundant in the intertidal zone. The snails can spend 20 years growing and building their shells as they graze on the algae that grows all over the rocks.\n\n--- What do hermit crabs eat?\nHermit crabs are scavengers. They eat decaying plants and algae in addition to dead animals.\n\n--- How do hermit crabs mate?\nWhen it\u2019s time for hermit crabs to mate they leave their shells briefly, mate, and then return to their shells. They are vulnerable outside of their shells so they do so quickly.\n\n--- Why do hermit crabs need shells?\nHermit crabs have stiff armored shells to protect their head, claws and walking legs. The back half of the hermit crab\u2019s body, including it\u2019s long curved abdomen, is soft to better fit inside a snail\u2019s spiral-shaped shell. Without a snail shell to protect it, a hermit crab is vulnerable to predators.\n\n---+ Find additional resources and a transcript on KQED Science:\n\nhttps://www.kqed.org/science/1975024/watch-these-hermit-crabs-shop-for-the-perfect-shell \n\n---+ More great Deep Look episodes:\n\nFor Pacific Mole Crabs It's Dig or Die | Deep Look\nhttps://youtu.be/tfoYD8pAsMw\n\nDecorator Crabs Make High Fashion at Low Tide | Deep Look\nhttps://youtu.be/OwQcv7TyX04\n\nWhack!

                    "description": "Hermit crabs are *obsessed* with snail shells. These crafty little crabs, found in California's rocky intertidal zone, are more than happy to let the snails build them a perfect home. When the crabs find a snail shell they like, they hop right into their new abode.\n\nSUBSCRIBE to Deep Look! http://goo.gl/8NwXqt\nPlease join our community on Patreon! https://www.patreon.com/deeplook\n\nDEEP LOOK is an ultra-HD (4K) short video series created by KQED San Francisco and presented by PBS Digital Studios. See the unseen at the very edge of our visible world. Explore big scientific mysteries by going incredibly small.\n\n---\nHermit crabs are one of the most recognizable and adored inhabitants of tide pools. But they aren\u2019t just cute (for a crab).\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re one of the most important creatures in the intertidal zone because of their role as scavengers,\u201d said Stephen Dunbar, a professor of biology at Loma Linda University. \u201cThey begin the process of cleaning up dead materials, like dead seaweed, fish, crabs, snails or whatever else.\u201d\n\nWhile hermit crabs scavenge for food, they also keep an eye out for new shells to call home.\n\nGrainyhand hermit crabs seem to prefer turban snail shells. That\u2019s good because turban snails are incredibly abundant in the intertidal zone. The snails can spend 20 years growing and building their shells as they graze on the algae that grows all over the rocks.\n\n--- What do hermit crabs eat?\nHermit crabs are scavengers. They eat decaying plants and algae in addition to dead animals.\n\n--- How do hermit crabs mate?\nWhen it\u2019s time for hermit crabs to mate they leave their shells briefly, mate, and then return to their shells. They are vulnerable outside of their shells so they do so quickly.\n\n--- Why do hermit crabs need shells?\nHermit crabs have stiff armored shells to protect their head, claws and walking legs. The back half of the hermit crab\u2019s body, including it\u2019s long curved abdomen, is soft to better fit inside a snail\u2019s spiral-shaped shell. Without a snail shell to protect it, a hermit crab is vulnerable to predators.\n\n---+ Find additional resources and a transcript on KQED Science:\n\nhttps://www.kqed.org/science/1975024/watch-these-hermit-crabs-shop-for-the-perfect-shell \n\n---+ More great Deep Look episodes:\n\nFor Pacific Mole Crabs It's Dig or Die | Deep Look\nhttps://youtu.be/tfoYD8pAsMw\n\nDecorator Crabs Make High Fashion at Low Tide | Deep Look\nhttps://youtu.be/OwQcv7TyX04\n\nWhack!

Their butterfly moms don\u2019t pollinate the pipevine in return, though. So, the vine traps unlucky gnats in its labyrinthine flowers to do the job.\n\nPlease join our community on Patreon! https://www.patreon.com/deeplook \nSUBSCRIBE to Deep Look! http://goo.gl/8NwXqt \n\nDEEP LOOK is an ultra-HD (4K) short video series created by KQED San Francisco and presented by PBS Digital Studios. See the unseen at the very edge of our visible world. Explore big scientific mysteries by going incredibly small. \n\n---\n\nThis is the story of a love triangle between a plant, a striking butterfly and an intrepid gnat. At the center of this triangle is the California pipevine (Aristolochia californica). The plant produces poisonous compounds called aristolochic acids and it\u2019s also known as the California Dutchman\u2019s pipe because its flowers are shaped like a tobacco pipe. \n\nThe California pipevine swallowtail butterfly (Battus philenor hirsuta) loves the vine. It flutters around the plant with its bright blue and orange wings and lays clusters of eggs on leaves and stems. When they hatch, the caterpillars feed exclusively on the pipevine. But the butterflies don\u2019t pollinate the plant. Instead, the pipevine lures fungus gnats into its flowers with a mushroomy aroma that reminds the flies of the fungi they feed on in the soil as larvae. The flies get stuck inside the curved flowers long enough for their hairs to get coated in pollen. This strategy in which a plant attracts pollinators under false pretenses is called deceptive pollination. \n\n--- Is the California pipevine a native plant?\nYes, it\u2019s the only pipevine native to the state. It grows naturally along rivers. \n\n--- Are fungus gnats considered pests?\nYes, they are. The adult flies lay their eggs in the earth, where their larvae feed on fungi and plant matter. If they get into potted soil, they can chew on the roots of houseplants and damage them. \n\n---+ Find additional resources and a transcript on KQED Science:\n\nhttps://www.kqed.org/science/1974786/the-pipevine-caterpillar-thrives-in-a-toxic-love-triangle\n\n---+ More great Deep Look episodes:\n\nWhy Is the Very Hungry Caterpillar So Dang Hungry?\nhttps://youtu.be/el_lPd2oFV4\n\nThis Giant Plant Looks Like Raw Meat and Smells Like Dead Rat\nhttps://youtu.be/ycUNj_Hv4_Y\n\n---+ Shoutout!\n\nGood try everyone!

                "description": "Look past their grasping claws and lightning-fast stingers, and you'll see scorpions have a delicate pair of comb-like organs on their belly called pectines. These sensory body parts help them navigate, and figure out who's a menace, a meal or a mate.\n\nPlease join our community on Patreon! https://www.patreon.com/deeplook\u200b\nSUBSCRIBE to Deep Look! http://goo.gl/8NwXqt\u200b \n\nDEEP LOOK is an ultra-HD (4K) short video series created by KQED San Francisco and presented by PBS Digital Studios. See the unseen at the very edge of our visible world. Explore big scientific mysteries by going incredibly small. \n\n---\n\nScorpions are arachnids with a monstrous reputation, but wait until you get to know their sensitive side. On their belly-sides, scorpions sport unique, brush-like organs called pectines, that endow them with extraordinary sensing abilities. These sensors help the animals with a variety of behaviors: finding mates; hunting prey; identifying other scorpions or predators; and they even help them navigate.\n \nEach pecten resembles a small comb, and each scorpion has a pair. These brush lightly over the ground as the animal walks. The comb structures contain an overlapping series of flexible teeth that make contact with whatever surface a scorpion walks on.  Zooming into a microscopic level, each tooth is covered in special sensory cells called peg sensilla that enable them to be extremely sensitive to chemicals and physical vibrations. There can be over 100,000 peg sensilla on each scorpion. Each peg sensilla is connected to the animal\u2019s brain by about a dozen nerve cells.  The animals read their environment by the detailed chemical and physical cues picked up through tiny pores on the tips of the peg sensilla.\n\n---\n\n---  How do scorpions reproduce?\nThe female scorpion will release pheromones, which are picked up by a male scorpion, using his pectines. The pair then performs a kind of dance called the \u201cpromenade a deux\u201d (French for \u201cwalk for two\u201d) where they grasp each other\u2019s claws and mouthparts. During the \u201cdance\u201d the male deposits a spermatophore \u2013 a structure that contains a packet of sperm \u2013 on the ground. He leads the female over the spermatophore, and she picks up the sperm packet to fertilize her eggs.  Gestation can last over a year for some species, and unlike most arachnids, the female scorpion gives birth to live young.  She even carries the offspring on her back for some time before their first molt.\n\n--- Where do scorpions live?\nScorpions do prefer arid or semi-arid habitats like deserts, but they have adapted to live in a wide range of environments, including high mountainous regions, subtropical forests and intertidal zones. They can be found on all continents except for Antarctica.  The Western forest scorpions (Uroctonus mordax) featured in this episode of Deep Look were found in a temperate forest in Oakland, California.\n\n--- How dangerous are scorpions to humans?\nA vast majority of the world\u2019s more than 2500 species of scorpions are not a serious threat to humans.  Only 25 species are known to have venom capable of killing a human.\n\n---+ Find additional resources and a transcript on KQED Science:\nhttps://www.kqed.org/science/1974305/scorpion-are-predators-with-a-sensitive-side/\n\n\n---+ More great Deep Look episodes:\n\nStinging Scorpion vs. Pain-Defying Mouse\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w-K_YtWqMro\n\nKangaroo Rats Are Furry, Spring-Loaded Ninjas\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hyKWwiefF8\n\nFor These Tiny Spiders, It's Sing or Get Served\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7qMqAgCqME\n\n---+ Shoutout!\n\n\ud83c\udfc6Congratulations\ud83c\udfc6 to the following 5 fans on our Deep Look Community Tab for identifying the pectines - the special organs on their belly behind their legs that respond to chemosensory and mechanosensory stimuli.\n\nSSAP\nOcto Valley\nJeremy Loh\nFelipe Valenzuela\nJosu\u00e9 Covarrubias\n\n\n---+ Thank you to our Top Patreon Supporters ($10+ per month)!\n\nChris B Emrick\nAlex\nBurt Humburg\nEgg-Roll \nShebastian Reyes\nJosh Kuroda\nWild Turkey\nKaren Reynolds\ndane rosseter\nDavid Deshpande\nDaisuke Goto\nAllison & Maka Masuda\nCompanion Cube\nNathan Jewsbury\nTianxing Wang\n\n---+ Follow KQED Science and Deep Look:\n \nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/kqedscience/\u200b \nTwitter: https://www.twitter.com/kqedscience\u200b \n\n---+ About KQED \n\nKQED, an NPR and PBS affiliate in San Francisco, California, serves Northern California and beyond with a public-supported alternative to commercial TV, radio and web media. \n\nFunding for Deep Look is provided in part by PBS Digital Studios.

                "description": "Could this tiny creature, named after a mythical multiheaded monster, hold the secret to eternal youth? Related to jellyfish and anemones, the hydra has an almost otherworldly ability to heal itself and stave off aging.\n\nSUBSCRIBE to Deep Look! http://goo.gl/8NwXqt\nPlease join our community on Patreon! https://www.patreon.com/deeplook\n\nDEEP LOOK is an ultra-HD (4K) short video series created by KQED San Francisco and presented by PBS Digital Studios. See the unseen at the very edge of our visible world. Explore big scientific mysteries by going incredibly small.\n\n---\nThe hydra gets its name from the Lernaean Hydra, a monster from Greek mythology that guarded an entrance to the underworld. Chop off one of the beast\u2019s many snake-like heads and two would grow in its place.\n\nWhile much less formidable in size, the real hydra does have a remarkable ability to heal from injuries. Cut a hydra in half and within a few days the bottom half will grow a new head. The severed head grows a new body.\n\nThe secret to the hydra's ability to heal and its seeming ability to not age is the abundance of stem cells that make up the hydra\u2019s tube-shaped body column.\n\n\u201cThe reason why hydra lives so long is because it has these continually active stem cells populations which don\u2019t seem to slow down at all,\u201d said Celina Juliano, a molecular and cellular biologist at UC Davis. \n\n\u201cThey\u2019re just constantly remaking all of the cells in the animal so every  20 days all of the cells are replaced with new cells.\u201d\n\n--- What does a hydra eat?\nHydra use their tentacles to ensnare swimming prey. Stinging cells in the tentacle paralyze the prey, which the tentacles then move toward the hydra\u2019s mouth. Hydra often eat like Daphnia and other aquatic invertebrates referred to informally as water fleas.  \n\n--- How do hydra reproduce?\nHydra can reproduce asexually by cloning themselves. The new clone, called a bud, grows directly from the hydra\u2019s side and eventually detaches. In addition to cloning, different species of hydra have different sexual reproduction strategies. \n\n--- How do hydra recover from injury?\nA large amount of the cells in a hydra\u2019s central column are stem cells. These cells can reproduce themselves and can also differentiate into all of the different specialized cells that make up the hydra's body.\n\n---+ Find additional resources and a transcript on KQED Science:\n\nhttps://www.kqed.org/science/1973744/the-undying-hydra-a-freshwater-mini-monster-that-defies-aging\n\n---+ More great Deep Look episodes:\n\nEver Seen a Starfish Gallop? | Deep Look\nhttps://youtu.be/9rxf_2EgwfE\n\nThis Adorable Sea Slug is a Sneaky Little Thief | Deep Look\nhttps://youtu.be/KLVfWKxtfow\n\nWhy Jellyfish Float Like a Butterfly \u2015 And Sting Like a Bee | Deep Look\nhttps://youtu.be/xQNxXUtRjzg\n\n\n---+ Shoutout!\n\n\ud83c\udfc6Congratulations\ud83c\udfc6 to the following 5 fans on our Deep Look Community Tab for identifying the process this creature undergoes to regenerate lost body parts - morphallaxis!\n\nIncoherentBabbler\nCode Red\nGanesh Kumar\nSam Sam\nObama Barrack\n\n---+ Thank you to our Top Patreon Supporters ($10+ per month)!\n\nEgg-Roll \nShebastian Reyes\nWild Turkey\nJosh Kuroda\nChris B Emrick\nKaren Reynolds\ndane rosseter\nDavid Deshpande\nDaisuke Goto\nJoshua Murallon Robertson\nElizabeth Ann Ditz\nKelly Hong\nKevin Judge\nGerardo Alfaro\nRobert Amling\nLaurel Przybylski\nLeonhardt Wille\nSonia Tanlimco\nEl Samuels\nMary Truland\nShelley Pearson Cranshaw\nSupernovabetty \nCarrie Mukaida\nSayantan Dasgupta\nAurora \nRoberta K Wright\nmonoirre \nRick Wong\nKristy Freeman\nSilvan\nCaitlin McDonough\nMisia Clive\nCarlos Carrasco\nNathan Wright\nLevi Cai\nNicolette Ray\nBlanca Vides\nTitania Juang\nTeresa Lavell\nScott Faunce\nCristen Rasmussen\n\n\n---+ Follow KQED Science and Deep Look:\n \nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/kqedscience/\nTwitter: https://www.twitter.com/kqedscience\n\n---+ About KQED\n\nKQED, an NPR and PBS affiliate in San Francisco, California, serves Northern California and beyond with a public-supported alternative to commercial TV, radio and web media.\n\nFunding for Deep Look is provided in part by PBS Digital Studios.

                    "description": "Could this tiny creature, named after a mythical multiheaded monster, hold the secret to eternal youth? Related to jellyfish and anemones, the hydra has an almost otherworldly ability to heal itself and stave off aging.\n\nSUBSCRIBE to Deep Look! http://goo.gl/8NwXqt\nPlease join our community on Patreon! https://www.patreon.com/deeplook\n\nDEEP LOOK is an ultra-HD (4K) short video series created by KQED San Francisco and presented by PBS Digital Studios. See the unseen at the very edge of our visible world. Explore big scientific mysteries by going incredibly small.\n\n---\nThe hydra gets its name from the Lernaean Hydra, a monster from Greek mythology that guarded an entrance to the underworld. Chop off one of the beast\u2019s many snake-like heads and two would grow in its place.\n\nWhile much less formidable in size, the real hydra does have a remarkable ability to heal from injuries. Cut a hydra in half and within a few days the bottom half will grow a new head. The severed head grows a new body.\n\nThe secret to the hydra's ability to heal and its seeming ability to not age is the abundance of stem cells that make up the hydra\u2019s tube-shaped body column.\n\n\u201cThe reason why hydra lives so long is because it has these continually active stem cells populations which don\u2019t seem to slow down at all,\u201d said Celina Juliano, a molecular and cellular biologist at UC Davis. \n\n\u201cThey\u2019re just constantly remaking all of the cells in the animal so every  20 days all of the cells are replaced with new cells.\u201d\n\n--- What does a hydra eat?\nHydra use their tentacles to ensnare swimming prey. Stinging cells in the tentacle paralyze the prey, which the tentacles then move toward the hydra\u2019s mouth. Hydra often eat like Daphnia and other aquatic invertebrates referred to informally as water fleas.  \n\n--- How do hydra reproduce?\nHydra can reproduce asexually by cloning themselves. The new clone, called a bud, grows directly from the hydra\u2019s side and eventually detaches. In addition to cloning, different species of hydra have different sexual reproduction strategies. \n\n--- How do hydra recover from injury?\nA large amount of the cells in a hydra\u2019s central column are stem cells. These cells can reproduce themselves and can also differentiate into all of the different specialized cells that make up the hydra's body.\n\n---+ Find additional resources and a transcript on KQED Science:\n\nhttps://www.kqed.org/science/1973744/the-undying-hydra-a-freshwater-mini-monster-that-defies-aging\n\n---+ More great Deep Look episodes:\n\nEver Seen a Starfish Gallop? | Deep Look\nhttps://youtu.be/9rxf_2EgwfE\n\nThis Adorable Sea Slug is a Sneaky Little Thief | Deep Look\nhttps://youtu.be/KLVfWKxtfow\n\nWhy Jellyfish Float Like a Butterfly \u2015 And Sting Like a Bee | Deep Look\nhttps://youtu.be/xQNxXUtRjzg\n\n\n---+ Shoutout!\n\n\ud83c\udfc6Congratulations\ud83c\udfc6 to the following 5 fans on our Deep Look Community Tab for identifying the process this creature undergoes to regenerate lost body parts - morphallaxis!\n\nIncoherentBabbler\nCode Red\nGanesh Kumar\nSam Sam\nObama Barrack\n\n---+ Thank you to our Top Patreon Supporters ($10+ per month)!\n\nEgg-Roll \nShebastian Reyes\nWild Turkey\nJosh Kuroda\nChris B Emrick\nKaren Reynolds\ndane rosseter\nDavid Deshpande\nDaisuke Goto\nJoshua Murallon Robertson\nElizabeth Ann Ditz\nKelly Hong\nKevin Judge\nGerardo Alfaro\nRobert Amling\nLaurel Przybylski\nLeonhardt Wille\nSonia Tanlimco\nEl Samuels\nMary Truland\nShelley Pearson Cranshaw\nSupernovabetty \nCarrie Mukaida\nSayantan Dasgupta\nAurora \nRoberta K Wright\nmonoirre \nRick Wong\nKristy Freeman\nSilvan\nCaitlin McDonough\nMisia Clive\nCarlos Carrasco\nNathan Wright\nLevi Cai\nNicolette Ray\nBlanca Vides\nTitania Juang\nTeresa Lavell\nScott Faunce\nCristen Rasmussen\n\n\n---+ Follow KQED Science and Deep Look:\n \nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/kqedscience/\nTwitter: https://www.twitter.com/kqedscience\n\n---+ About KQED\n\nKQED, an NPR and PBS affiliate in San Francisco, California, serves Northern California and beyond with a public-supported alternative to commercial TV, radio and web media.\n\nFunding for Deep Look is provided in part by PBS Digital Studios.

Many different flies, butterflies and moths lay eggs on the leaves of citrus, vegetables and ornamental plants that grow into leaf miner larvae.\n\nOne leaf miner that gardeners might find in their arugula is the larva of a fly called Scaptomyza. The fly is related to \u2013 and looks a lot like \u2013 the fruit fly you might find buzzing around your ripe bananas.\n\nThe chemicals called isothiocyanates that give leafy greens like arugula their bitter taste are precisely the plants\u2019 defense mechanism against pests. Scaptomyza flies have evolved to tolerate low levels of these compounds. One way in which the flies deal with these toxic chemicals is by laying their eggs on the leaves with the lowest concentrations.\n\n---\n\n--- Can leaf miners kill plants?\n\nLeaf miners rarely do enough damage to even come close to killing a plant, but they make individual leaves inedible. If given enough time, a leaf miner can be particularly damaging to vegetables that are harvested specifically for their leaves. But don\u2019t worry if you mistakenly eat a larva \u2013 it won\u2019t make you sick.\n\n--- How do you treat leaf miners?\n\nMost backyard gardeners only need to remove the damaged leaves by hand.

The moth lays its eggs on the green immature capsule of female flowers in the spring and summer, and the immature larvae bore into the young seed capsules.  \n\nThe developing seed will be home and food for the larva as it grows. By late summer, the capsules separate into three sections, falling to the ground.  The seed capsules with larvae inside them hop around on the ground, to avoid overheating in the harsh sun of the Sonoran Desert. To do this, each larva weaves a silk lining along the seed interior, grabs on with its hind legs, and thrashes its head against the walls. The force topples the seed, as the larva uses its finely-tuned sense of temperature to seek shade.\n\nAfter spending most of its life shimmying around inside the seed capsule, the larva transforms into a pupa, and eventually into an adult moth.

The moth has co-evolved with the Mexican jumping bean bush and depends on it for survival.  So far, the bush and the moth are not endangered, but the supply is not limitless.\n\n--- Are there other kinds of jumping beans in the world?\nIn the same family, the Tamboti tree in Africa also produces jumping beans, sometimes called \u201cAfrican jumping beans.\u201d Also, there are other kinds of jumping galls, some of which are inhabited by gall wasps (see our gall wasp episode below).\n\n---+ Find additional resources and a transcript on KQED Science:\n\nhttps://www.kqed.org/science/1973307/why-did-the-mexican-jumping-bean-jump\n\n ---+ More great Deep Look episodes:\n\nWhat Gall!

                "description": "Female aphids are the matriarchs of a successful family operation\u2014 taking over your garden. But don\u2019t lose hope; these pests have some serious predators and creepy parasites looking to take them down. \n\nSUBSCRIBE to Deep Look! http://goo.gl/8NwXqt\nPlease join our community on Patreon! https://www.patreon.com/deeplook\n\nDEEP LOOK is an ultra-HD (4K) short video series created by KQED San Francisco and presented by PBS Digital Studios. See the unseen at the very edge of our visible world. Explore big scientific mysteries by going incredibly small.\n\n---\n\nAphids are one of gardeners\u2019 most hated pests. They\u2019re incredibly prolific, seemingly popping up overnight to take down your favorite veggies. \n\n\"Aphids are just experts at reproducing,\" said Ian Grettenberger an entomologist at the University of California, Davis. \"Given the right conditions, they can multiply really quickly and get out of control. \n\nFor most of the year female aphids giving live birth to clones that are themselves already pregnant. That means that most of the time, all of the aphids you see in your garden are pregnant females.\n\nWhen their population gets big enough and the plant they\u2019re on starts to wane, aphids start giving birth to a new type of winged clones called alates. Amazingly, the alates are genetically identical to their wingless mothers. The alates take to the air to find new plants to colonize.\n\n--- What do aphids eat?\nAphids use their pointy stylet to pierce plant leaves and such out the sugary sap. Usually, plants can handle a light infestation, but aphids reproduce quickly. Heavily infested leaves yellow and wither. Aphids can also carry viruses that they spread between the different plants they feed on.\n\n--- How do aphids spread?\nAphids give birth to winged clones called alates that fly from plant to plant. Since aphids can clone themselves, it only takes one aphid to infiltrate your garden and start causing trouble.\n\n--- How do I get rid of aphids?\nSome gardeners use oils and pesticide sprays to get rid of aphids but it\u2019s very challenging to get every last one of them. You can purchase predators like lacewing larvae to hunt and eat aphids. You can also purchase parasitoid wasps that lay their eggs in aphids, killing them.\n\n---+ Find additional resources and a transcript on KQED Science:\n\nhttps://www.kqed.org/science/1973052/born-pregnant-aphids-invade-with-an-onslaught-of-clones/\n\n---+ More great Deep Look episodes:\n\nThese Mites Rain Down To Save Your Strawberries | Deep Look\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q1XFi9r3dIE\n\nSharpshooter Insects\u2019 Sexy Vibrations Spell Trouble in the Vineyard | Deep Look\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFA614SEDMQ\n\nSamurai Wasps Say 'Smell Ya Later, Stink Bugs' | Deep Look\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T8y2XmjdXqw&t=75s\n\n---+ Shoutout!\n\n\ud83c\udfc6Congratulations\ud83c\udfc6 to the following 5 fans on our Deep Look Community Tab for identifying the phenomenon of aphids giving birth to young that are already pregnant - telescoping generations!\n\nDuncan\nAphidKirby\nPhilliam P\nPawe\u0142 Szymanek\nB.C.\n\n---+ Thank you to our Top Patreon Supporters ($10+ per month)!\n\nAlex\nBurt Humburg\nEgg-Roll \nShebastian Reyes\nWild Turkey\nJosh Kuroda\nChris B Emrick\nKaren Reynolds\ndane rosseter\nDavid Deshpande\nDaisuke Goto\nNathan Jewsbury\nTianxing Wang\nAllison & Maka Masuda\nCompanion Cube\nJoshua Murallon Robertson\nElizabeth Ann Ditz\nKelly Hong\nKevin Judge\nGerardo Alfaro\nRobert Amling\nLaurel Przybylski\nLeonhardt Wille\nSonia Tanlimco\nEl Samuels\nMary Truland\nShelley Pearson Cranshaw\nSupernovabetty \nCarrie Mukaida\nSayantan Dasgupta\nAurora \nRoberta K Wright\nmonoirre \nRick Wong\nKristy Freeman\nSilvan\nCaitlin McDonough\nMisia Clive\nCarlos Carrasco\nNathan Wright\nLevi Cai\nNicolette Ray\nBlanca Vides\nTitania Juang\nTeresa Lavell\nScott Faunce\nCristen Rasmussen\nSyniurge \nSueEllen McCann\nNoreen Herrington\nLouis O'Neill\nKallie Moore\nAnastasia Grinkevic\nCindy McGill\nAurora Mitchell\nTearra Guice\nAdam Kurtz\nKW \nLaura Sanborn\nTierZoo \n\n---+ Follow KQED Science and Deep Look:\n \nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/kqedscience/\nTwitter: https://www.twitter.com/kqedscience\n\n---+ About KQED\n\nKQED, an NPR and PBS affiliate in San Francisco, California, serves Northern California and beyond with a public-supported alternative to commercial TV, radio and web media.\n\nFunding for Deep Look is provided in part by PBS Digital Studios.

But don\u2019t lose hope; these pests have some serious predators and creepy parasites looking to take them down. \n\nSUBSCRIBE to Deep Look! http://goo.gl/8NwXqt\nPlease join our community on Patreon! https://www.patreon.com/deeplook\n\nDEEP LOOK is an ultra-HD (4K) short video series created by KQED San Francisco and presented by PBS Digital Studios. See the unseen at the very edge of our visible world. Explore big scientific mysteries by going incredibly small.\n\n---\n\nAphids are one of gardeners\u2019 most hated pests. They\u2019re incredibly prolific, seemingly popping up overnight to take down your favorite veggies. \n\n\"Aphids are just experts at reproducing,\" said Ian Grettenberger an entomologist at the University of California, Davis. \"Given the right conditions, they can multiply really quickly and get out of control. \n\nFor most of the year female aphids giving live birth to clones that are themselves already pregnant. That means that most of the time, all of the aphids you see in your garden are pregnant females.\n\nWhen their population gets big enough and the plant they\u2019re on starts to wane, aphids start giving birth to a new type of winged clones called alates. Amazingly, the alates are genetically identical to their wingless mothers. The alates take to the air to find new plants to colonize.\n\n--- What do aphids eat?\nAphids use their pointy stylet to pierce plant leaves and such out the sugary sap. Usually, plants can handle a light infestation, but aphids reproduce quickly. Heavily infested leaves yellow and wither. Aphids can also carry viruses that they spread between the different plants they feed on.\n\n--- How do aphids spread?\nAphids give birth to winged clones called alates that fly from plant to plant. Since aphids can clone themselves, it only takes one aphid to infiltrate your garden and start causing trouble.\n\n--- How do I get rid of aphids?\nSome gardeners use oils and pesticide sprays to get rid of aphids but it\u2019s very challenging to get every last one of them. You can purchase predators like lacewing larvae to hunt and eat aphids. You can also purchase parasitoid wasps that lay their eggs in aphids, killing them.\n\n---+ Find additional resources and a transcript on KQED Science:\n\nhttps://www.kqed.org/science/1973052/born-pregnant-aphids-invade-with-an-onslaught-of-clones/\n\n---+ More great Deep Look episodes:\n\nThese Mites Rain Down To Save Your Strawberries | Deep Look\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q1XFi9r3dIE\n\nSharpshooter Insects\u2019 Sexy Vibrations Spell Trouble in the Vineyard | Deep Look\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFA614SEDMQ\n\nSamurai Wasps Say 'Smell Ya Later, Stink Bugs' | Deep Look\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T8y2XmjdXqw&t=75s\n\n---+ Shoutout!\n\n\ud83c\udfc6Congratulations\ud83c\udfc6 to the following 5 fans on our Deep Look Community Tab for identifying the phenomenon of aphids giving birth to young that are already pregnant - telescoping generations!\n\nDuncan\nAphidKirby\nPhilliam P\nPawe\u0142 Szymanek\nB.C.\n\n---+ Thank you to our Top Patreon Supporters ($10+ per month)!\n\nAlex\nBurt Humburg\nEgg-Roll \nShebastian Reyes\nWild Turkey\nJosh Kuroda\nChris B Emrick\nKaren Reynolds\ndane rosseter\nDavid Deshpande\nDaisuke Goto\nNathan Jewsbury\nTianxing Wang\nAllison & Maka Masuda\nCompanion Cube\nJoshua Murallon Robertson\nElizabeth Ann Ditz\nKelly Hong\nKevin Judge\nGerardo Alfaro\nRobert Amling\nLaurel Przybylski\nLeonhardt Wille\nSonia Tanlimco\nEl Samuels\nMary Truland\nShelley Pearson Cranshaw\nSupernovabetty \nCarrie Mukaida\nSayantan Dasgupta\nAurora \nRoberta K Wright\nmonoirre \nRick Wong\nKristy Freeman\nSilvan\nCaitlin McDonough\nMisia Clive\nCarlos Carrasco\nNathan Wright\nLevi Cai\nNicolette Ray\nBlanca Vides\nTitania Juang\nTeresa Lavell\nScott Faunce\nCristen Rasmussen\nSyniurge \nSueEllen McCann\nNoreen Herrington\nLouis O'Neill\nKallie Moore\nAnastasia Grinkevic\nCindy McGill\nAurora Mitchell\nTearra Guice\nAdam Kurtz\nKW \nLaura Sanborn\nTierZoo \n\n---+ Follow KQED Science and Deep Look:\n \nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/kqedscience/\nTwitter: https://www.twitter.com/kqedscience\n\n---+ About KQED\n\nKQED, an NPR and PBS affiliate in San Francisco, California, serves Northern California and beyond with a public-supported alternative to commercial TV, radio and web media.\n\nFunding for Deep Look is provided in part by PBS Digital Studios.

See the unseen at the very edge of our visible world. Explore big scientific mysteries by going incredibly small. \n---\nNight falls, and the beaches come alive with sand hoppers \u2013 hungry, jumping shrimp-like creatures that look a lot like giant translucent fleas. No, it\u2019s not a horror movie, and these animals \u201cdon\u2019t bite or suck your blood. They\u2019re much more than fleas,\u201d says Jenny Dugan of the Marine Science Institute at UC Santa Barbara. Through her research on sandy beach ecology, Dugan has spent years developing a respect for beach hoppers and their under-appreciated ecological role.\n\nThe small crustaceans, sometimes as large as two inches, are remarkably in tune with the tides. The mature adult beach hoppers only emerge from their burrows at night when the tide is retreating \u2013 which is the best time to find fresh kelp, and less of a risk being seen by predators. \n\nResearchers refer to these animals as shredders because they do the necessary work of breaking down and recycling nutrients in beach wrack and kelp, the first step in sending nutrients into the food chain. The presence of sustainable populations of beach hoppers is an indicator of the overall health of a sandy beach ecosystem.  \n\n--- Where do beach hoppers live?\nBeach hoppers \u2013 also known as sand hoppers \u2013 live on sandy beaches in subtropical and temperate zones all over the world.  North and South America, Europe, Africa, New Zealand and Australia all have a variety of native species of beach hoppers.  On beaches with large amounts of kelp, seagrass and seaweeds washing ashore, you are bound to find sand hoppers too.\n\n--- Do beach hoppers bite people?\nNo. Beach hoppers do not bite!  They might look like a giant flea, but they aren\u2019t fleas.  They are a type of crustacean.  Their favorite food is kelp, but they will eat anything that makes up beach wrack \u2013 the piles of organic matter that wash ashore on sandy beaches.\n\n--- How do beach hoppers know where they are going?\nResearch indicates that some species of beach hoppers use cues from the moon and the sun to orient themselves, and to stay in sync with the ebb and flow cycles of the tides. \n\n---+ Find additional resources and a transcript on KQED Science:\n\nhttps://www.kqed.org/science/1972559/these-acrobatic-beach-hoppers-shred-all-night-long\n\n---+ More great Deep Look episodes:\n\nThe Snail-Smashing, Fish-Spearing, Eye-Popping Mantis Shrimp\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lm1ChtK9QDU\n\nCalifornia Floater Mussels Take Fish For an Epic Joyride\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7p_w4zE3s4\n\n\n---+ Shoutout!\n\n\ud83c\udfc6Congratulations\ud83c\udfc6 to the following 5 fans on our Deep Look Community Tab for identifying the parts of the body the beach hopper use to jump - the uropods - abdominal appendages and parts of their tail.\n\n// \u0394 V S T I N //\nSourabh Kamat\nJared Blake\nAngryFox07\nsushil singh\n\n---+ Thank you to our Top Patreon Supporters ($10+ per month)!\n\nBurt Humburg\nAlex\nShebastian Reyes\nDaniel Weinstein\nEgg-Roll \nKaren Reynolds\nWild Turkey\nJosh Kuroda\nChris B Emrick\ndane rosseter\nDavid Deshpande\nDaisuke Goto\nAllison & Maka Masuda\nCompanion Cube\nTianxing Wang\nNathan Jewsbury\nKelly Hong\nKevin Judge\nLeonhardt Wille\nGerardo Alfaro\nElizabeth Ann Ditz\nLaurel Przybylski\nMary Truland\nSonia Tanlimco\nRobert Amling\nSupernovabetty \nSayantan Dasgupta\nRoberta K Wright\nJoshua Murallon Robertson\nCindy McGill\nShelley Pearson Cranshaw\nCarrie Mukaida\nAurora \nmonoirre \nSilvan\nRick Wong\nLevi Cai\nSyniurge \nCristen Rasmussen\nCarlos Carrasco\nMisia Clive\nKristy Freeman\nNicolette Ray\nNathan Wright\nTitania Juang\nKallie Moore\nCaitlin McDonough\nScott Faunce\nSueEllen McCann\nNoreen Herrington\nBlanca Vides\nTeresa Lavell\nLouis O'Neill\nTearra Guice\nLaura Sanborn\nAurora Mitchell\nAdam Kurtz\nKW \nTierZoo \n\n---+ Follow KQED Science and Deep Look:\n \nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/kqedscience/\u200b \nTwitter: https://www.twitter.com/kqedscience\u200b \n\n---+ About KQED \n\nKQED, an NPR and PBS affiliate in San Francisco, California, serves Northern California and beyond with a public-supported alternative to commercial TV, radio and web media. \n\nFunding for Deep Look is provided in part by PBS Digital Studios.

                "description": "California oak moth caterpillars eat all the leaves on an oak, leaving a brown skeleton. Then they rappel down on a strand of silk, twirling and swinging. If you were enjoying the shade, good luck getting out of their way. For the oak, the caterpillars are a bigger deal \u2013\u2013 will the tree survive?\n\nSUBSCRIBE to Deep Look! http://goo.gl/8NwXqt \nPlease join our community on Patreon! https://www.patreon.com/deeplook\n\nDEEP LOOK is an ultra-HD (4K) short video series created by KQED San Francisco and presented by PBS Digital Studios. See the unseen at the very edge of our visible world. Explore big scientific mysteries by going incredibly small. \n\n---\n\nIt\u2019s an event that scientists still can\u2019t explain. Every few years, a light-brown moth native to California seems to appear out of nowhere up and down the state. These California oak moths surround a few trees, usually coast live oaks. Females beat their wings frantically to attract a mate. Once they lay their eggs, the tree is in trouble.\n\nBright-yellow, orange and black caterpillars, known as California oakworms, cover its leaves after a few months. \n\n\u201cThey will completely devour one tree, while the tree right next to it seems completely untouched,\u201d said Peter Oboyski, executive director of the Essig Museum of Entomology at the University of California, Berkeley. \u201cThat suggests that the females are all laying their eggs on the same tree. Is it because they\u2019re attracted to each other? Or is it because this tree is particularly yummy and the tree next to it maybe has too many defensive chemicals? A lot of what\u2019s interesting about this story is all the mystery around it.\u201d\n\n--- \n\n--- What are those clouds of moths around that oak?\nIn the San Francisco Bay Area, California oak moths emerge in mid-June and in early to mid-October. As the sun sets, you\u2019ll see clouds of them fluttering around an oak, often a coast live oak. Moths lay their white and red eggs on the oak\u2019s leaves or on plants below the tree. \n\nThe moths that fly in June lay eggs from which caterpillars hatch in early July. The moths that fly in mid-October lay eggs that hatch at the end of the month. These caterpillars develop very slowly over winter and turn into the pupae from which moths will emerge in mid-June. That\u2019s why California oak moths often lay their eggs on coast live oaks so that the evergreen trees can provide foliage for their hungry caterpillars through the winter. \n\n--- Should you get rid of California oak moths?\nEven though it\u2019s harrowing to watch caterpillars defoliate an oak, Oboyski said that healthy trees usually survive the onslaught and grow back their leaves. \n\n---+ Find additional resources and a transcript on KQED Science:\n\nhttps://www.kqed.org/science/1972082/these-silk-swinging-caterpillars-will-ruin-your-picnic\n\n---+ More great Deep Look episodes:\n\nWhy Is The Very Hungry Caterpillar So Dang Hungry?\nhttps://youtu.be/el_lPd2oFV4\n\nIt\u2019s a Goopy Mess When Pines and Beetles Duke it Out \nhttps://youtu.be/wR5O48zsbnc\n\n---+ Shoutout!\n\n\ud83c\udfc6Congratulations\ud83c\udfc6 to the following 5 fans on our Deep Look Community Tab for identifying why the female oak moth is fanning her wings - to spread her pheromones to attract males!\n\nTorterraGrey8\nmr egg\nAverage Viewer\nMiguel Jose\nJared Blake\n\n---+ Thank you to our Top Patreon Supporters ($10+ per month)!\n\nBill Cass\nAlex\nBurt Humburg\nShebastian Reyes\nEgg-Roll \nDaniel Weinstein\nJosh Kuroda\nChris B Emrick\nWild Turkey\nKaren Reynolds\ndane rosseter\nDavid Deshpande\nDaisuke Goto\nCompanion Cube\nTianxing Wang\nNathan Jewsbury\nKevin Judge\nKelly Hong\nRobert Amling\nLaurel Przybylski\nGerardo Alfaro\nElizabeth Ann Ditz\nLeonhardt Wille\nSonia Tanlimco\nMary Truland\nShelley Pearson Cranshaw\nSupernovabetty \nSayantan Dasgupta\nCarrie Mukaida\nmonoirre \nJoshua Murallon Robertson\nCindy McGill\nSilvan\nAurora \nRick Wong\nRoberta K Wright\nTitania Juang\nLevi Cai\nGuillaume Morin\nNathan Wright\nMisia Clive\nCarlos Carrasco\nKristy Freeman\nCaitlin McDonough\nNoreen Herrington\nBlanca Vides\nTeresa Lavell\nCristen Rasmussen\nNicolette Ray\nDogman\nKallie Moore\nSyniurge \nScott Faunce\nSueEllen McCann\nTearra Guice\nGeidi Rodriguez\nLouis O'Neill\nLaura Sanborn\nAurora Mitchell\nKW \nAdam Kurtz\nTierZoo \n\n---+ Follow KQED Science and Deep Look:\n \nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/kqedscience/ \nTwitter: https://www.twitter.com/kqedscience \n\n---+ About KQED \n\nKQED, an NPR and PBS affiliate in San Francisco, California, serves Northern California and beyond with a public-supported alternative to commercial TV, radio and web media. \n\nFunding for Deep Look is provided in part by PBS Digital Studios.

                    "description": "California oak moth caterpillars eat all the leaves on an oak, leaving a brown skeleton. Then they rappel down on a strand of silk, twirling and swinging. If you were enjoying the shade, good luck getting out of their way. For the oak, the caterpillars are a bigger deal \u2013\u2013 will the tree survive?\n\nSUBSCRIBE to Deep Look! http://goo.gl/8NwXqt \nPlease join our community on Patreon! https://www.patreon.com/deeplook\n\nDEEP LOOK is an ultra-HD (4K) short video series created by KQED San Francisco and presented by PBS Digital Studios. See the unseen at the very edge of our visible world. Explore big scientific mysteries by going incredibly small. \n\n---\n\nIt\u2019s an event that scientists still can\u2019t explain. Every few years, a light-brown moth native to California seems to appear out of nowhere up and down the state. These California oak moths surround a few trees, usually coast live oaks. Females beat their wings frantically to attract a mate. Once they lay their eggs, the tree is in trouble.\n\nBright-yellow, orange and black caterpillars, known as California oakworms, cover its leaves after a few months. \n\n\u201cThey will completely devour one tree, while the tree right next to it seems completely untouched,\u201d said Peter Oboyski, executive director of the Essig Museum of Entomology at the University of California, Berkeley. \u201cThat suggests that the females are all laying their eggs on the same tree. Is it because they\u2019re attracted to each other? Or is it because this tree is particularly yummy and the tree next to it maybe has too many defensive chemicals? A lot of what\u2019s interesting about this story is all the mystery around it.\u201d\n\n--- \n\n--- What are those clouds of moths around that oak?\nIn the San Francisco Bay Area, California oak moths emerge in mid-June and in early to mid-October. As the sun sets, you\u2019ll see clouds of them fluttering around an oak, often a coast live oak. Moths lay their white and red eggs on the oak\u2019s leaves or on plants below the tree. \n\nThe moths that fly in June lay eggs from which caterpillars hatch in early July. The moths that fly in mid-October lay eggs that hatch at the end of the month. These caterpillars develop very slowly over winter and turn into the pupae from which moths will emerge in mid-June. That\u2019s why California oak moths often lay their eggs on coast live oaks so that the evergreen trees can provide foliage for their hungry caterpillars through the winter. \n\n--- Should you get rid of California oak moths?\nEven though it\u2019s harrowing to watch caterpillars defoliate an oak, Oboyski said that healthy trees usually survive the onslaught and grow back their leaves. \n\n---+ Find additional resources and a transcript on KQED Science:\n\nhttps://www.kqed.org/science/1972082/these-silk-swinging-caterpillars-will-ruin-your-picnic\n\n---+ More great Deep Look episodes:\n\nWhy Is The Very Hungry Caterpillar So Dang Hungry?\nhttps://youtu.be/el_lPd2oFV4\n\nIt\u2019s a Goopy Mess When Pines and Beetles Duke it Out \nhttps://youtu.be/wR5O48zsbnc\n\n---+ Shoutout!\n\n\ud83c\udfc6Congratulations\ud83c\udfc6 to the following 5 fans on our Deep Look Community Tab for identifying why the female oak moth is fanning her wings - to spread her pheromones to attract males!\n\nTorterraGrey8\nmr egg\nAverage Viewer\nMiguel Jose\nJared Blake\n\n---+ Thank you to our Top Patreon Supporters ($10+ per month)!\n\nBill Cass\nAlex\nBurt Humburg\nShebastian Reyes\nEgg-Roll \nDaniel Weinstein\nJosh Kuroda\nChris B Emrick\nWild Turkey\nKaren Reynolds\ndane rosseter\nDavid Deshpande\nDaisuke Goto\nCompanion Cube\nTianxing Wang\nNathan Jewsbury\nKevin Judge\nKelly Hong\nRobert Amling\nLaurel Przybylski\nGerardo Alfaro\nElizabeth Ann Ditz\nLeonhardt Wille\nSonia Tanlimco\nMary Truland\nShelley Pearson Cranshaw\nSupernovabetty \nSayantan Dasgupta\nCarrie Mukaida\nmonoirre \nJoshua Murallon Robertson\nCindy McGill\nSilvan\nAurora \nRick Wong\nRoberta K Wright\nTitania Juang\nLevi Cai\nGuillaume Morin\nNathan Wright\nMisia Clive\nCarlos Carrasco\nKristy Freeman\nCaitlin McDonough\nNoreen Herrington\nBlanca Vides\nTeresa Lavell\nCristen Rasmussen\nNicolette Ray\nDogman\nKallie Moore\nSyniurge \nScott Faunce\nSueEllen McCann\nTearra Guice\nGeidi Rodriguez\nLouis O'Neill\nLaura Sanborn\nAurora Mitchell\nKW \nAdam Kurtz\nTierZoo \n\n---+ Follow KQED Science and Deep Look:\n \nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/kqedscience/ \nTwitter: https://www.twitter.com/kqedscience \n\n---+ About KQED \n\nKQED, an NPR and PBS affiliate in San Francisco, California, serves Northern California and beyond with a public-supported alternative to commercial TV, radio and web media. \n\nFunding for Deep Look is provided in part by PBS Digital Studios.

See the unseen at the very edge of our visible world. Explore big scientific mysteries by going incredibly small.\n\n---\n\nFlies are formidable opponents, with an arsenal of tools they carry all over their bodies. For starters, their hair and antennae help a fly sense us as we walk up to them. And a fly\u2019s eyes and tiny brain process information 10 times faster than human eyes and brains. \n\n\u201cCompared to flies, humans are slow and sluggish creatures,\u201d said Sanjay Sane, who researches flies at the National Centre for Biological Sciences at the Tata Institute of Fundamental Research in Bangalore, India.\n\nOnce the fly escapes your swatter and is in the air, it\u2019s in its element and your job is even tougher. Seen up close and slowed down, a fly\u2019s aerobatics are impressive: It makes razor-sharp turns with ease and at great speed. \n\nWhat makes this possible is a pair of modified wings called halteres, a Greek word for dumbbell, which describes their shape. All of the 200,000 species of flies that scientists have described have a pair of halteres and a pair of wings. (That includes mosquitoes, which, wouldn\u2019t you know it, are flies too). Most other insects \u2013 bees, butterflies, dragonflies \u2013 have four wings and no halteres.\n\n--- How do flies\u2019 halteres work?\n\nAs a fly turns, its halteres sense the rotation. In a split second, neurons at the base of the halteres send information to the fly\u2019s muscles to steer its wings and keep its head steady.\n\n\u201cHouseflies flap their wings about 200 times per second, which means they really only have five milliseconds to figure out what the next wingbeat is going to be like. And if you\u2019re using vision that takes too long to do,\u201d said Jessica Fox, who studies flies at Case Western Reserve University, in Ohio. \u201cThey really need a mechanical receptor in order to be able to sense their body rotations and correct them on the timescale that they need.\u201d\n\n--- How do flies land and stay on the ceiling?\n\nTheir halteres allow them to rotate quickly to land on the ceiling. Once they\u2019re there, they hang upside down with tiny hooks and sticky pads on their feet. The pads, called pulvilli, have microscopic hairs that excrete a liquid that sticks to the surface.\n\n--- How do I swat a fly?\n\u201cFlies process information about moving objects but they cannot process static objects, Sane explained. \u201cThus, the best way to approach a fly is in small, quasi-static steps such that they do not see you as a moving object.\u201d\n\n---+ Read the entire article on KQED Science:\n\nhttps://www.kqed.org/science/1971058/heres-how-that-annoying-fly-dodges-your-swatter/\n\n---+ Shoutout!\n\n\ud83c\udfc6Congratulations\ud83c\udfc6 to the these 5 fans on our  Community Tab for identifying the tiny limbs beneath a fly's wings - halteres: \n\nTom Riddle\nUnknown Gamer\nCaeliGlori\nTorterraGrey8\nJuanma G.V.\n\n---+ Thank you to our Top Patreon Supporters ($10+ per month)!\n\n Bill Cass\nJustin Bull\nBurt Humburg\nAlex\nShebastian Reyes\nDaniel Weinstein\nEgg-Roll \nKaren Reynolds\nWild Turkey\nChris B Emrick\nJosh Kuroda\nTea Torvinen\ndane rosseter\nDavid Deshpande\nDaisuke Goto\nCompanion Cube\nTianxing Wang\nElizabeth Ann Ditz\nKevin Judge\nLeonhardt Wille\nLaurel Przybylski\nDia\nKelly Hong\nRobert Amling\nGerardo Alfaro\nluna \nMary Truland\nSayantan Dasgupta\nSupernovabetty \nJoshua Murallon Robertson\nAurora \nPamela Parker\nCarrie Mukaida\nShelley Pearson Cranshaw\nCindy McGill\nLaura Sanborn\nSilvan Wendland\nmonoirre \nRick Wong\nCarlos Carrasco\nTitania Juang\nRoberta K Wright\nMisia Clive\nNathan Wright\nSonia Tanlimco\nLevi Cai\nNicolette Ray\nTeresa Lavell\nCaitlin McDonough\nKristy Freeman\nBlanca Vides\nAlexandre Valdetaro\nGuillaume Morin\nNoreen Herrington\nScott Faunce\nCristen Rasmussen\nDogman\nLouis O'Neill\nKallie Moore\nGeidi Rodriguez\nSyniurge \nSueEllen McCann\nKW \nJoao Ascensao\nAurora Mitchell\nSharon Merritt\nAdam Kurtz\nTierZoo \n\n---+ Follow KQED Science and Deep Look:\n\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/kqedscience/\nTwitter: https://www.twitter.com/kqedscience\n\n---+ About KQED\n\nKQED, an NPR and PBS affiliate in San Francisco, CA, serves Northern California and beyond with a public-supported alternative to commercial TV, radio and web media.\n\nFunding for Deep Look is provided in part by PBS Digital Studios.

The pads, called pulvilli, have microscopic hairs that excrete a liquid that sticks to the surface.\n\n--- How do I swat a fly?\n\u201cFlies process information about moving objects but they cannot process static objects, Sane explained. \u201cThus, the best way to approach a fly is in small, quasi-static steps such that they do not see you as a moving object.\u201d\n\n---+ Read the entire article on KQED Science:\n\nhttps://www.kqed.org/science/1971058/heres-how-that-annoying-fly-dodges-your-swatter/\n\n---+ Shoutout!\n\n\ud83c\udfc6Congratulations\ud83c\udfc6 to the these 5 fans on our  Community Tab for identifying the tiny limbs beneath a fly's wings - halteres: \n\nTom Riddle\nUnknown Gamer\nCaeliGlori\nTorterraGrey8\nJuanma G.V.\n\n---+ Thank you to our Top Patreon Supporters ($10+ per month)!\n\n Bill Cass\nJustin Bull\nBurt Humburg\nAlex\nShebastian Reyes\nDaniel Weinstein\nEgg-Roll \nKaren Reynolds\nWild Turkey\nChris B Emrick\nJosh Kuroda\nTea Torvinen\ndane rosseter\nDavid Deshpande\nDaisuke Goto\nCompanion Cube\nTianxing Wang\nElizabeth Ann Ditz\nKevin Judge\nLeonhardt Wille\nLaurel Przybylski\nDia\nKelly Hong\nRobert Amling\nGerardo Alfaro\nluna \nMary Truland\nSayantan Dasgupta\nSupernovabetty \nJoshua Murallon Robertson\nAurora \nPamela Parker\nCarrie Mukaida\nShelley Pearson Cranshaw\nCindy McGill\nLaura Sanborn\nSilvan Wendland\nmonoirre \nRick Wong\nCarlos Carrasco\nTitania Juang\nRoberta K Wright\nMisia Clive\nNathan Wright\nSonia Tanlimco\nLevi Cai\nNicolette Ray\nTeresa Lavell\nCaitlin McDonough\nKristy Freeman\nBlanca Vides\nAlexandre Valdetaro\nGuillaume Morin\nNoreen Herrington\nScott Faunce\nCristen Rasmussen\nDogman\nLouis O'Neill\nKallie Moore\nGeidi Rodriguez\nSyniurge \nSueEllen McCann\nKW \nJoao Ascensao\nAurora Mitchell\nSharon Merritt\nAdam Kurtz\nTierZoo \n\n---+ Follow KQED Science and Deep Look:\n\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/kqedscience/\nTwitter: https://www.twitter.com/kqedscience\n\n---+ About KQED\n\nKQED, an NPR and PBS affiliate in San Francisco, CA, serves Northern California and beyond with a public-supported alternative to commercial TV, radio and web media.\n\nFunding for Deep Look is provided in part by PBS Digital Studios.

They can be found munching on the microscopic algae that grow on the surface of eelgrass, a type of marine seagrass. Also known as the Taylor\u2019s sea hare, these humble, zebra-striped slices of green jello are actually crucial to the health of their ecosystem.\n\nThey don\u2019t eat the grass itself; instead they help the meadows grow by clearing the way for sunlight to reach the plants, scraping the blades of grass clean with their rows of tiny teeth.

At Elkhorn Slough, a large winding estuary off of Monterey Bay, the eelgrass beds form a habitat for a diverse community of animals and plant life, which includes sea otters, Dungeness crabs, clams, skeleton shrimp and various fish.\n\nFor decades, nutrient overload from agricultural runoff has caused excessive algae blooms in Elkhorn Slough, as the thick algal mats block out the sunlight needed for the grass to grow. But with the reintroduction of sea otters to Elkhorn Slough in the 1980\u2019s, ecologists observed a balancing effect on the system.  The otters started eating the crabs that eat the sea hares.  Because of this trophic cascade, the slug population grew, and their appetite for algae helped keep the eelgrass clean, counterbalancing the effects of the algal blooms.  \n \n--- Is a sea hare a nudibranch?\n\nNudibranchs and sea hares are both different types of sea slugs.

                "description": "High up in their 300-foot tower penthouse, falcon stars Annie and Grinnell's romance quickly gets real, as they face the tough demands of raising a family. They furiously guard their eggs from invaders, then stuff their screaming newborn chicks with meat. Will these kids ever leave the nest?\n\nWatch Self Evident on PBS Voices! \nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQkloQHtdo4&list=PL1mtdjDVOoOoOprSD5CrM3bvGeNvgkzGS\n\nDEEP LOOK is an ultra-HD (4K) wildlife and nature series created by KQED San Francisco and presented by PBS Digital Studios. See the unseen at the very edge of our visible world. Explore big scientific mysteries by going incredibly small.\n\n---\n\nGrinnell, a male peregrine falcon, looked up from his nest and started screaming. It was late March and he was taking a turn warming the four eggs he and his partner, Annie, were caring for in their home atop the bell tower at the University of California, Berkeley. A young female peregrine falcon, quite a bit larger than Grinnell, was lurking on the ledge above him. Young peregrine falcons will often come around the site where a pair is already nesting to check it out and plot a possible takeover. She walked right up to Grinnell in the nest and shrieked almost in his face. Grinnell spread his wings wide and swiftly chased her off the tower. \n\nGrinnell had reason to be territorial. He and Annie have been raising chicks on this 300-foot tower since 2017. \n\nPeregrine falcons are the fastest animals in the world: When in hot pursuit of a pigeon or other bird to pluck from midair they can reach 240 miles per hour \u2013 faster than a single engine plane.  But even these raptor superstars need to settle down with a mate and have some babies to whom they can pass on their love for meat. When they do, they often pick a tall building in a city. Peregrine falcons regularly make their homes in cities across the United States, from New York to Chicago to San Francisco. \n\n---\n\n--- Why do peregrine falcons nest on tall buildings?\n\nTall buildings \u2013 just like the cliffs they live on in the wild \u2013 give peregrine falcons protection from predators, a perch from which to hunt pigeons and other birds and ledges where they can lay their eggs. \n\n--- Do peregrine falcons make nests?\n\nPeregrines don\u2019t build a nest of twigs and leaves.

They furiously guard their eggs from invaders, then stuff their screaming newborn chicks with meat. Will these kids ever leave the nest?\n\nWatch Self Evident on PBS Voices! \nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQkloQHtdo4&list=PL1mtdjDVOoOoOprSD5CrM3bvGeNvgkzGS\n\nDEEP LOOK is an ultra-HD (4K) wildlife and nature series created by KQED San Francisco and presented by PBS Digital Studios. See the unseen at the very edge of our visible world. Explore big scientific mysteries by going incredibly small.\n\n---\n\nGrinnell, a male peregrine falcon, looked up from his nest and started screaming. It was late March and he was taking a turn warming the four eggs he and his partner, Annie, were caring for in their home atop the bell tower at the University of California, Berkeley. A young female peregrine falcon, quite a bit larger than Grinnell, was lurking on the ledge above him. Young peregrine falcons will often come around the site where a pair is already nesting to check it out and plot a possible takeover. She walked right up to Grinnell in the nest and shrieked almost in his face. Grinnell spread his wings wide and swiftly chased her off the tower. \n\nGrinnell had reason to be territorial. He and Annie have been raising chicks on this 300-foot tower since 2017. \n\nPeregrine falcons are the fastest animals in the world: When in hot pursuit of a pigeon or other bird to pluck from midair they can reach 240 miles per hour \u2013 faster than a single engine plane.  But even these raptor superstars need to settle down with a mate and have some babies to whom they can pass on their love for meat. When they do, they often pick a tall building in a city. Peregrine falcons regularly make their homes in cities across the United States, from New York to Chicago to San Francisco. \n\n---\n\n--- Why do peregrine falcons nest on tall buildings?\n\nTall buildings \u2013 just like the cliffs they live on in the wild \u2013 give peregrine falcons protection from predators, a perch from which to hunt pigeons and other birds and ledges where they can lay their eggs. \n\n--- Do peregrine falcons make nests?\n\nPeregrines don\u2019t build a nest of twigs and leaves. In the wild, they lay their eggs on a ledge in a cliff into which the female has scratched a bowl-shaped depression called a scrape to prevent her eggs from rolling away. \n\n--- Why did the peregrine falcon nearly go extinct?\n\nThe pesticide DDT, used heavily in the 1940s and until 1972 in the United States to control mosquitoes and agricultural pests, accumulated in peregrines\u2019 bodies. It thwarted the development of their embryos. And it reduced the amount of calcium in the eggs, which resulted in eggshells so thin that they broke when parents sat on them.\n\n---+ Read the entire article on KQED Science:\n\nhttps://www.kqed.org/science/1969983/raising-peregrine-falcon-chicks-is-a-real-cliff-hanger/\n\n---+ For more information:\n\nWatch Annie and Grinnell live on three cameras on the Cal Falcons channel: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCmjo8Rlp6q98TZlG8TDF4GQ/featured\n\n---+ Thank you to our Top Patreon Supporters ($10+ per month)!\n\nBill Cass\nJustin Bull\nBurt Humburg\nAlex\nShebastian Reyes\nDaniel Weinstein\nEgg-Roll \nKaren Reynolds\nWild Turkey\nChris B Emrick\nJosh Kuroda\nTea Torvinen\ndane rosseter\nDavid Deshpande\nDaisuke Goto\nCompanion Cube\nTianxing Wang\nElizabeth Ann Ditz\nKevin Judge\nLeonhardt Wille\nLaurel Przybylski\nDia\nKelly Hong\nRobert Amling\nGerardo Alfaro\nluna \nMary Truland\nSayantan Dasgupta\nSupernovabetty \nJoshua Murallon Robertson\nAurora \nPamela Parker\nCarrie Mukaida\nShelley Pearson Cranshaw\nCindy McGill\nLaura Sanborn\nSilvan Wendland\nmonoirre \nRick Wong\nCarlos Carrasco\nTitania Juang\nRoberta K Wright\nMisia Clive\nNathan Wright\nSonia Tanlimco\nLevi Cai\nNicolette Ray\nTeresa Lavell\nCaitlin McDonough\nKristy Freeman\nBlanca Vides\nAlexandre Valdetaro\nGuillaume Morin\nNoreen Herrington\nScott Faunce\nCristen Rasmussen\nDogman\nLouis O'Neill\nKallie Moore\nGeidi Rodriguez\nSyniurge \nSueEllen McCann\nKW \nJoao Ascensao\nAurora Mitchell\nSharon Merritt\nAdam Kurtz\nTierZoo \n\n---+ Follow KQED Science and Deep Look: \nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/kqedscience/ \nTwitter: https://www.twitter.com/kqedscience \nKQED Science on kqed.org: http://www.kqed.org/science \n\n---+ About KQED KQED, an NPR and PBS affiliate in San Francisco, CA, serves Northern California and beyond with a public-supported alternative to commercial TV, radio and web media.

                "description": "Orb weaver spiders build exquisite spiral webs not only to catch insects, but to extend their senses. Once they shrink-wrap their prey with silk, the nearly blind spiders can store them for later, and read their web's strands as a kind of memory map to guide them back.\n\nTake the PBS Digital Studios Survey!  http://to.pbs.org/2020survey\nSUBSCRIBE to Deep Look: http://goo.gl/8NwXqt\n \nDEEP LOOK is an ultra-HD (4K) wildlife and nature series created by KQED San Francisco and presented by PBS Digital Studios. See the unseen at the very edge of our visible world. Explore big scientific mysteries by going incredibly small.\n\n\n---\nThe more than 48,000 spider species create a wide variety of web styles. There are over 4,000 different species of orb weaver spiders alone; these are the eight-legged spinners that create the famous spiral-shaped webs. \n\nAnyone who\u2019s watched orb weavers in action has seen them use their exquisite creations to deftly ensnare flying insects. Impressive as this, the webs function as much more than deadly traps. \n\nWebs play an integral role in everything an orb weaver does.  When spiders are hungry, they can tighten the web\u2019s strands and even adjust its size and shape, depending on what size of prey they\u2019re in the mood for. These species are only able to see light, dark and a little movement, but they are somehow able to quickly navigate their webs, pinpointing their unlucky victims and binding them in silk, a meal saved for later. \n\nBecause they can do so much with such tiny brains, some researchers think orb weavers use their webs as a form of extended cognition, outsourcing advanced mental tasks like problem-solving and memory. For example, once they have killed and wrapped their prey, a spider can store it for later, then easily find it again. They don\u2019t need to remember every single thread they have spun \u2014 just a few previous steps. By using their webs to do some of their thinking for them, orb weavers may be preserving precious brain power for other necessary and complex tasks like capturing prey. \n\n--- Where do orb weavers spiders live?\n\nOrb weaver species live everywhere on planet earth except for Antarctica and the Arctic.  As long as there is abundant food (i.e. insects) and a place to build their web, you are likely to find an orb weaver.\n\n--- What other kinds of spider webs are there besides orb webs?\n\nIn addition to the signature spiral-shaped designs made by orb weavers, spider webs come in various other styles, such as tangles (aka cobwebs), funnels and sheets.\n\n---+ Read the entire article on KQED Science:\n\nhttps://www.kqed.org/science/1969661/is-a-spiders-web-a-part-of-its-mind/\n\n---+ For more information:\n\nThe work of Thomas Hesselberg\nhttp://www.thomashesselberg.com/\n\nHilton Japyass\u00fa\u2019s work on extended cognition in spiders\nhttps://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10071-017-1069-7\n\n---+ Shoutout!\n\n\ud83c\udfc6Congratulations\ud83c\udfc6 to the following fans on our Deep Look Community Tab for being the top five emjoi and ascii artists for this episode!\n\nEevee Extreme    (55 votes)\nAmber Shepherd    (20)\nSecond Maker by KS    (16)\nSeth Holton    (16)\nFaixan Lol    (10)\n\n---+ Thank you to our Top Patreon Supporters ($10+ per month)!\n\nBill Cass\nJustin Bull\nBurt Humburg\nAlex\nShebastian Reyes\nEgg-Roll \nJosh Kuroda\nDaniel Weinstein\nChris B Emrick\nKaren Reynolds\nDaniel Pang\nTea Torvinen\ndane rosseter\nDavid Deshpande\nDaisuke Goto\nCompanion Cube\nNathan Z\nTianxing Wang\nluna \nKelly Hong\nKevin Judge\nElizabeth Ann Ditz\nLaurel Przybylski\nGerardo Alfaro\nLeonhardt Wille\nRobert Amling\nMary Truland\nShelley Pearson Cranshaw\nSupernovabetty \nLaura Sanborn\nSayantan Dasgupta\nCindy McGill\nPamela Parker\nJoshua Murallon Robertson\nmonoirre \nSilvan Wendland\nAurora \nDia\nRoberta K Wright\nSonia Tanlimco\nLevi Cai\nGuillaume Morin\nMisia Clive\nCaitlin McDonough\nRick Wong\nNathan Wright\nTitania Juang\nCarlos Carrasco\nNicolette Ray\nKristy Freeman\nAlexandre Valdetaro\nSyniurge \nDogman\nCristen Rasmussen\nGeidi Rodriguez\nBlanca Vides\nScott Faunce\nNoreen Herrington\nKallie Moore\nSueEllen McCann\nTeresa Lavell\nLouis O'Neill\nAurora Mitchell\nSharon Merritt\nPushkar Chitale\nKW \nJoao Ascensao\nTierZoo \n\n---+ Follow KQED Science and Deep Look:\n\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/kqedscience/\nTwitter: https://www.twitter.com/kqedscience\nKQED Science on kqed.org: http://www.kqed.org/science\n\n---+ About KQED\n\nKQED, an NPR and PBS affiliate in San Francisco, CA, serves Northern California and beyond with a public-supported alternative to commercial TV, Radio and web media.\n\nFunding for Deep Look is provided in part by PBS Digital Studios.

                    "description": "Orb weaver spiders build exquisite spiral webs not only to catch insects, but to extend their senses. Once they shrink-wrap their prey with silk, the nearly blind spiders can store them for later, and read their web's strands as a kind of memory map to guide them back.\n\nTake the PBS Digital Studios Survey!  http://to.pbs.org/2020survey\nSUBSCRIBE to Deep Look: http://goo.gl/8NwXqt\n \nDEEP LOOK is an ultra-HD (4K) wildlife and nature series created by KQED San Francisco and presented by PBS Digital Studios. See the unseen at the very edge of our visible world. Explore big scientific mysteries by going incredibly small.\n\n\n---\nThe more than 48,000 spider species create a wide variety of web styles. There are over 4,000 different species of orb weaver spiders alone; these are the eight-legged spinners that create the famous spiral-shaped webs. \n\nAnyone who\u2019s watched orb weavers in action has seen them use their exquisite creations to deftly ensnare flying insects. Impressive as this, the webs function as much more than deadly traps. \n\nWebs play an integral role in everything an orb weaver does.  When spiders are hungry, they can tighten the web\u2019s strands and even adjust its size and shape, depending on what size of prey they\u2019re in the mood for. These species are only able to see light, dark and a little movement, but they are somehow able to quickly navigate their webs, pinpointing their unlucky victims and binding them in silk, a meal saved for later. \n\nBecause they can do so much with such tiny brains, some researchers think orb weavers use their webs as a form of extended cognition, outsourcing advanced mental tasks like problem-solving and memory. For example, once they have killed and wrapped their prey, a spider can store it for later, then easily find it again. They don\u2019t need to remember every single thread they have spun \u2014 just a few previous steps. By using their webs to do some of their thinking for them, orb weavers may be preserving precious brain power for other necessary and complex tasks like capturing prey. \n\n--- Where do orb weavers spiders live?\n\nOrb weaver species live everywhere on planet earth except for Antarctica and the Arctic.  As long as there is abundant food (i.e. insects) and a place to build their web, you are likely to find an orb weaver.\n\n--- What other kinds of spider webs are there besides orb webs?\n\nIn addition to the signature spiral-shaped designs made by orb weavers, spider webs come in various other styles, such as tangles (aka cobwebs), funnels and sheets.\n\n---+ Read the entire article on KQED Science:\n\nhttps://www.kqed.org/science/1969661/is-a-spiders-web-a-part-of-its-mind/\n\n---+ For more information:\n\nThe work of Thomas Hesselberg\nhttp://www.thomashesselberg.com/\n\nHilton Japyass\u00fa\u2019s work on extended cognition in spiders\nhttps://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10071-017-1069-7\n\n---+ Shoutout!\n\n\ud83c\udfc6Congratulations\ud83c\udfc6 to the following fans on our Deep Look Community Tab for being the top five emjoi and ascii artists for this episode!\n\nEevee Extreme    (55 votes)\nAmber Shepherd    (20)\nSecond Maker by KS    (16)\nSeth Holton    (16)\nFaixan Lol    (10)\n\n---+ Thank you to our Top Patreon Supporters ($10+ per month)!\n\nBill Cass\nJustin Bull\nBurt Humburg\nAlex\nShebastian Reyes\nEgg-Roll \nJosh Kuroda\nDaniel Weinstein\nChris B Emrick\nKaren Reynolds\nDaniel Pang\nTea Torvinen\ndane rosseter\nDavid Deshpande\nDaisuke Goto\nCompanion Cube\nNathan Z\nTianxing Wang\nluna \nKelly Hong\nKevin Judge\nElizabeth Ann Ditz\nLaurel Przybylski\nGerardo Alfaro\nLeonhardt Wille\nRobert Amling\nMary Truland\nShelley Pearson Cranshaw\nSupernovabetty \nLaura Sanborn\nSayantan Dasgupta\nCindy McGill\nPamela Parker\nJoshua Murallon Robertson\nmonoirre \nSilvan Wendland\nAurora \nDia\nRoberta K Wright\nSonia Tanlimco\nLevi Cai\nGuillaume Morin\nMisia Clive\nCaitlin McDonough\nRick Wong\nNathan Wright\nTitania Juang\nCarlos Carrasco\nNicolette Ray\nKristy Freeman\nAlexandre Valdetaro\nSyniurge \nDogman\nCristen Rasmussen\nGeidi Rodriguez\nBlanca Vides\nScott Faunce\nNoreen Herrington\nKallie Moore\nSueEllen McCann\nTeresa Lavell\nLouis O'Neill\nAurora Mitchell\nSharon Merritt\nPushkar Chitale\nKW \nJoao Ascensao\nTierZoo \n\n---+ Follow KQED Science and Deep Look:\n\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/kqedscience/\nTwitter: https://www.twitter.com/kqedscience\nKQED Science on kqed.org: http://www.kqed.org/science\n\n---+ About KQED\n\nKQED, an NPR and PBS affiliate in San Francisco, CA, serves Northern California and beyond with a public-supported alternative to commercial TV, Radio and web media.\n\nFunding for Deep Look is provided in part by PBS Digital Studios.

                "description": "Cape sundews are carnivorous plants that grow in bogs, where they don't have access to many nutrients. So they exude sweet, shimmering droplets from their tentacles to lure in unsuspecting insects. Once their prey is hopelessly stuck, they wrap it up and dissolve it for a tasty meal. \n\nSUBSCRIBE to Deep Look! http://goo.gl/8NwXqt\nPlease support us on Patreon! https://www.patreon.com/deeplook\n\nDEEP LOOK is a ultra-HD (4K) short video series created by KQED San Francisco and presented by PBS Digital Studios. See the unseen at the very edge of our visible world. Explore big scientific mysteries by going incredibly small.\n\n---\n\nIf you have houseplants, most of the time there's not a lot of visible activity. \n\nBut then there are carnivorous plants, like sundews. They aren\u2019t content to just sit still. Typically found in habitats where other plants usually can\u2019t thrive \u2014 like bogs with nutrient-poor soil \u2014 they often need to supplement their diet with nutrients like nitrogen and phosphorus. Carnivorous plants have developed a way to obtain these key nutrients from another source: insects. \n\n---+ Read the entire article on KQED Science:\n\nhttps://www.kqed.org/science/1966521/cape-sundews-trap-bugs-in-a-sticky-situation\n\n---+ Why must you use distilled water with carnivorous plants?\n\n\u201cMany carnivorous plants have evolved carnivory in response to a substantial lack of nutrients in their native soils. As a result of living in nutrient-poor soils for so long, their root systems tend to be very sensitive to minerals. It\u2019s like if you stayed inside for months, then went out on a sunny day. Your skin is going to be extra-sensitive and could burn easily. We give them rainwater or distilled water that has these minerals removed.\u201d\n\n---+ What happens to the exoskeletons of the insects after they finish digesting them? \n\n\u201cCarnivorous plants can only digest soft tissues, and insect exoskeletons (made of out chitin and other proteins) are too tough and too nutrient-poor for them to digest. Exoskeletons are left behind after digestions and depending on the plant, can be washed away by rain, or simply just \u201chang out\u201d on the leaf. Many carnivores can continue to catch insects even if there is an exoskeleton left behind as long as it doesn\u2019t impede the mechanical trapping mechanism.\u201d\n\n---+ Do these plants have predators?\n\u201cYes!

So they exude sweet, shimmering droplets from their tentacles to lure in unsuspecting insects. Once their prey is hopelessly stuck, they wrap it up and dissolve it for a tasty meal. \n\nSUBSCRIBE to Deep Look! http://goo.gl/8NwXqt\nPlease support us on Patreon! https://www.patreon.com/deeplook\n\nDEEP LOOK is a ultra-HD (4K) short video series created by KQED San Francisco and presented by PBS Digital Studios. See the unseen at the very edge of our visible world. Explore big scientific mysteries by going incredibly small.\n\n---\n\nIf you have houseplants, most of the time there's not a lot of visible activity. \n\nBut then there are carnivorous plants, like sundews. They aren\u2019t content to just sit still. Typically found in habitats where other plants usually can\u2019t thrive \u2014 like bogs with nutrient-poor soil \u2014 they often need to supplement their diet with nutrients like nitrogen and phosphorus. Carnivorous plants have developed a way to obtain these key nutrients from another source: insects. \n\n---+ Read the entire article on KQED Science:\n\nhttps://www.kqed.org/science/1966521/cape-sundews-trap-bugs-in-a-sticky-situation\n\n---+ Why must you use distilled water with carnivorous plants?\n\n\u201cMany carnivorous plants have evolved carnivory in response to a substantial lack of nutrients in their native soils. As a result of living in nutrient-poor soils for so long, their root systems tend to be very sensitive to minerals. It\u2019s like if you stayed inside for months, then went out on a sunny day. Your skin is going to be extra-sensitive and could burn easily. We give them rainwater or distilled water that has these minerals removed.\u201d\n\n---+ What happens to the exoskeletons of the insects after they finish digesting them? \n\n\u201cCarnivorous plants can only digest soft tissues, and insect exoskeletons (made of out chitin and other proteins) are too tough and too nutrient-poor for them to digest. Exoskeletons are left behind after digestions and depending on the plant, can be washed away by rain, or simply just \u201chang out\u201d on the leaf. Many carnivores can continue to catch insects even if there is an exoskeleton left behind as long as it doesn\u2019t impede the mechanical trapping mechanism.\u201d\n\n---+ Do these plants have predators?\n\u201cYes! Traditional \u201cpests\u201d like grasshoppers, caterpillars, aphids, scale, mealybugs, etc. can chew holes in traps or weaken developing leaves. Many can avoid the traps themselves.\u201d\n\n---+ The above answers were provided by David Fefferman of the Carnivorous Plant Resource.

                "description": "Ensatinas are a sprawling group of colorful salamanders, each one with different strategies for avoiding predators, from bold warning colors to confusing camouflage. Their diverse family tree offers us a rare snapshot of millions of years of evolution \u2013 how one species becomes many.\n\nSUBSCRIBE to Deep Look! http://goo.gl/8NwXqt\n\nDEEP LOOK is a ultra-HD (4K) short video series created by KQED San Francisco and presented by PBS Digital Studios. See the unseen at the very edge of our visible world. Explore big scientific mysteries by going incredibly small.\n\n---\nEven though they sport different colors and behaviors, and are spread out across the Western coastal states, from Canada to Baja California, they are still considered one species.  That is because all types of ensatinas are able to mate and have offspring with each of their neighbors.\n\nBut when researchers look more closely, the two types of ensatinas at the southern tips of their range \u2014 the Monterey ensatina and the large-blotched ensatina \u2014 only rarely mate and have offspring where their populations overlap. Some combination of genetic differences, habitat preference and behavior are keeping the lineages separate.\n\nThis makes ensatina salamanders a rare example of a \u201cring species\u201d \u2014 an animal that spread and adapted around a geographic barrier \u2014 in this case, California\u2019s dry Central Valley \u2014 only to come back together millions of years later as near strangers.\n\nA ring species like the ensatina is unique in that it neatly illustrates the rich story of evolution \u2014 an idea that English biologist Charles Darwin and others have supported with countless studies since 1859, when Darwin published his landmark book \u201cOn the Origin of Species.\u201d\n\nEvolutionary scientists are looking at ensatinas to build on Darwin\u2019s original ideas about how species form; and as a way to help understand biodiversity all across the planet.\n\n---+ Are ensatina salamanders poisonous?\nThey can exude a slightly toxic milky substance from poison glands in their tails, but this substance is not dangerous to predators.  \n\n---+ What is the difference between a salamander and a newt?\nNewts are a type of salamander, belonging to a subfamily called Pleurodelinae of the family Salamandridae. Most newts have webbed feet and a paddle-like tail, which make it easier to live in the water during the aquatic stages of their lives. Salamanders typically have longer and more rounded tails with well-developed toes for digging in soil.  \n\n---+ More info\n\nTom Devitt on ensatinas: \nhttps://evolution.berkeley.edu/evolibrary/article/0_0_0/devitt_01\n\nMore Barry Sinervo's work here:\n\nLizards Have Been Playing Rock-Paper-Scissors for 15 Million Years\u201d\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rafdHxBwIbQ\n\n---+ Read the entire article on KQED Science:\n\nhttps://www.kqed.org/science/1966227/these-sneaky-ensatina-salamanders-are-heading-for-a-family-split\n\n---+ Shoutout!\n\n \ud83c\udfc6Congratulations\ud83c\udfc6 to the following five fans on our Community Tab for being the first to name all 3 newt species the ensatina mimics! \n\nMildred\nTara Damer\nTim Garcia\nNoah K.

                    "description": "Ensatinas are a sprawling group of colorful salamanders, each one with different strategies for avoiding predators, from bold warning colors to confusing camouflage. Their diverse family tree offers us a rare snapshot of millions of years of evolution \u2013 how one species becomes many.\n\nSUBSCRIBE to Deep Look! http://goo.gl/8NwXqt\n\nDEEP LOOK is a ultra-HD (4K) short video series created by KQED San Francisco and presented by PBS Digital Studios. See the unseen at the very edge of our visible world. Explore big scientific mysteries by going incredibly small.\n\n---\nEven though they sport different colors and behaviors, and are spread out across the Western coastal states, from Canada to Baja California, they are still considered one species.  That is because all types of ensatinas are able to mate and have offspring with each of their neighbors.\n\nBut when researchers look more closely, the two types of ensatinas at the southern tips of their range \u2014 the Monterey ensatina and the large-blotched ensatina \u2014 only rarely mate and have offspring where their populations overlap. Some combination of genetic differences, habitat preference and behavior are keeping the lineages separate.\n\nThis makes ensatina salamanders a rare example of a \u201cring species\u201d \u2014 an animal that spread and adapted around a geographic barrier \u2014 in this case, California\u2019s dry Central Valley \u2014 only to come back together millions of years later as near strangers.\n\nA ring species like the ensatina is unique in that it neatly illustrates the rich story of evolution \u2014 an idea that English biologist Charles Darwin and others have supported with countless studies since 1859, when Darwin published his landmark book \u201cOn the Origin of Species.\u201d\n\nEvolutionary scientists are looking at ensatinas to build on Darwin\u2019s original ideas about how species form; and as a way to help understand biodiversity all across the planet.\n\n---+ Are ensatina salamanders poisonous?\nThey can exude a slightly toxic milky substance from poison glands in their tails, but this substance is not dangerous to predators.  \n\n---+ What is the difference between a salamander and a newt?\nNewts are a type of salamander, belonging to a subfamily called Pleurodelinae of the family Salamandridae. Most newts have webbed feet and a paddle-like tail, which make it easier to live in the water during the aquatic stages of their lives. Salamanders typically have longer and more rounded tails with well-developed toes for digging in soil.  \n\n---+ More info\n\nTom Devitt on ensatinas: \nhttps://evolution.berkeley.edu/evolibrary/article/0_0_0/devitt_01\n\nMore Barry Sinervo's work here:\n\nLizards Have Been Playing Rock-Paper-Scissors for 15 Million Years\u201d\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rafdHxBwIbQ\n\n---+ Read the entire article on KQED Science:\n\nhttps://www.kqed.org/science/1966227/these-sneaky-ensatina-salamanders-are-heading-for-a-family-split\n\n---+ Shoutout!\n\n \ud83c\udfc6Congratulations\ud83c\udfc6 to the following five fans on our Community Tab for being the first to name all 3 newt species the ensatina mimics! \n\nMildred\nTara Damer\nTim Garcia\nNoah K.

They dig their mouthpart into a grapevine\u2019s xylem, the tissue that carries up water and small amounts of sugars and minerals from the roots and distributes this sap throughout the plant. While sharpshooters stuff themselves, they inject a bacterium called Xylella fastidiosa into grapevines.

At this point, we\u2019re familiar with how to protect ourselves from the virus \u2013 and the disease it causes, COVID-19 \u2013 by washing our hands thoroughly, wearing masks and social distancing.\n\nMost people who get the virus are mildly sick and will recover at home. For others, the virus can be severe, even fatal.\n\nOne significant way the virus attacks is deep in our lungs.\n\n---+ Read the entire article on KQED Science:\n\nhttps://www.kqed.org/science/1963200/how-covid-19-attacks-your-lungs\n\n--- What are the symptoms of the new coronavirus?\nThe Center for Disease Control advises on its website that \u201csymptoms may appear 2-14 days after exposure to the virus. People with these symptoms or combinations of symptoms may have COVID-19: Cough, shortness of breath or difficulty breathing. Or at least two of these symptoms: fever; chills; Repeated shaking with chills; muscle pain; headache; sore throat; new loss of taste or smell.\u201d \n\n--- How can I protect myself from the coronavirus?\nThe Center for Disease Control has a comprehensive list of guidelines at cdc.gov, but the main tips to remember are: wash your hands often; avoid close contact with other people; cover your mouth and nose with a cloth face cover (like a mask or bandanna) when around others; cover coughs and sneezes with a tissue or your elbow; regularly clean and disinfect frequently touched surfaces in your home.\n\n--- If you\u2019ve had the new coronavirus, are you now immune?\nThe Center for Disease Control states on its website: \u201cWe do not know yet if having antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 can protect someone from getting infected with that virus again, or how long that protection might last. Scientists are doing studies to answer those questions.\u201d\n\n---+ For more information:\nKQED\nhttps://www.kqed.org/coronavirusliveupdates\n\nWorld Health Organization\nhttps://www.who.int/\n\nCenter for Disease Control\nhttps://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-nCoV/index.html\n\n---+ More Great Deep Look episodes:\n\nDecompress with Deep Look https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLdKlciEDdCQBNcPi8j3XEXuTOKW8CgRgD\n\n---+ Thank you to our Top Patreon Supporters ($10+ per month)!\n\nAlex\nAlexandre Valdetaro\nAurora \nAurora Mitchell\nBethany \nBill Cass\nBlanca Vides\nBurt Humburg\nCaitlin McDonough\nCarlos Carrasco\nChris B Emrick\nChris Murphy\nCindy McGill\nCompanion Cube\nDaisuke Goto\ndane rosseter\nDaniel Weinstein\nDavid Deshpande\nDean Skoglund\nEgg-Roll \nElizabeth Ann Ditz\nGeidi Rodriguez\nGerardo Alfaro\nGuillaume Morin\nJoao Ascensao\nJosh Kuroda\nJoshua Murallon Robertson\nJustin Bull\nKallie Moore\nKaren Reynolds\nKristy Freeman\nKW \nLaura Sanborn\nLaurel Przybylski\nLeonhardt Wille\nLevi Cai\nLouis O'Neill\nluna \nMary Truland\nmonoirre \nNathan Wright\nNicolette Ray\nNoreen Herrington\nPamela Parker\nRichard Shalumov\nRick Wong\nRobert Amling\nRobert Warner\nRoberta K Wright\nSarah Khalida Mohamad\nSayantan Dasgupta\nSharon Merritt\nShebastian Reyes\nShelley Pearson Cranshaw\nSilvan Wendland\nSonia Tanlimco\nSteven \nSueEllen McCann\nSupernovabetty \nSyniurge \nTea Torvinen\nTierZoo \nTitania Juang\nWhatzGames \n\n\n---+ Follow KQED Science and Deep Look:\n\nPatreon: https://www.patreon.com/deeplook\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/kqedscience/\nTwitter: https://www.twitter.com/kqedscience\nKQED Science on kqed.org: http://www.kqed.org/science\nFacebook Watch: https://www.facebook.com/DeepLookPBS/\n\n---+ About KQED\n\nKQED, an NPR and PBS affiliate in San Francisco, CA, serves Northern California and beyond with a public-supported alternative to commercial TV, Radio and web media.\n\nFunding for Deep Look is provided in part by PBS Digital Studios.

It penetrates deep into your lungs, causing our immune cells to go haywire and damage tiny air sacs \u2013 the alveoli \u2013 where oxygen normally flows into our blood.\n\nMore COVID-19 Reporting and resources from KQED Science:  https://www.kqed.org/science/1963200/how-covid-19-attacks-your-lungs\n\nEducators: Engage your students in an NGSS-aligned discussion about this video on KQED Learn: https://learn.kqed.org/discussions/68.

Explore big scientific mysteries by going incredibly small.\n\n---\n\nThe coronavirus has had an enormous impact on our lives: how we work, communicate and congregate. At this point, we\u2019re familiar with how to protect ourselves from the virus \u2013 and the disease it causes, COVID-19 \u2013 by washing our hands thoroughly, wearing masks and social distancing.\n\nMost people who get the virus are mildly sick and will recover at home. For others, the virus can be severe, even fatal.\n\nOne significant way the virus attacks is deep in our lungs.\n\n---+ Read the entire article on KQED Science:\n\nhttps://www.kqed.org/science/1963200/how-covid-19-attacks-your-lungs\n\n--- What are the symptoms of the new coronavirus?\nThe Center for Disease Control advises on its website that \u201csymptoms may appear 2-14 days after exposure to the virus. People with these symptoms or combinations of symptoms may have COVID-19: Cough, shortness of breath or difficulty breathing. Or at least two of these symptoms: fever; chills; Repeated shaking with chills; muscle pain; headache; sore throat; new loss of taste or smell.\u201d \n\n--- How can I protect myself from the coronavirus?\nThe Center for Disease Control has a comprehensive list of guidelines at cdc.gov, but the main tips to remember are: wash your hands often; avoid close contact with other people; cover your mouth and nose with a cloth face cover (like a mask or bandanna) when around others; cover coughs and sneezes with a tissue or your elbow; regularly clean and disinfect frequently touched surfaces in your home.\n\n--- If you\u2019ve had the new coronavirus, are you now immune?\nThe Center for Disease Control states on its website: \u201cWe do not know yet if having antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 can protect someone from getting infected with that virus again, or how long that protection might last. Scientists are doing studies to answer those questions.\u201d\n\n---+ For more information:\nKQED\nhttps://www.kqed.org/coronavirusliveupdates\n\nWorld Health Organization\nhttps://www.who.int/\n\nCenter for Disease Control\nhttps://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-nCoV/index.html\n\n---+ More Great Deep Look episodes:\n\nDecompress with Deep Look https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLdKlciEDdCQBNcPi8j3XEXuTOKW8CgRgD\n\n---+ Thank you to our Top Patreon Supporters ($10+ per month)!\n\nAlex\nAlexandre Valdetaro\nAurora \nAurora Mitchell\nBethany \nBill Cass\nBlanca Vides\nBurt Humburg\nCaitlin McDonough\nCarlos Carrasco\nChris B Emrick\nChris Murphy\nCindy McGill\nCompanion Cube\nDaisuke Goto\ndane rosseter\nDaniel Weinstein\nDavid Deshpande\nDean Skoglund\nEgg-Roll \nElizabeth Ann Ditz\nGeidi Rodriguez\nGerardo Alfaro\nGuillaume Morin\nJoao Ascensao\nJosh Kuroda\nJoshua Murallon Robertson\nJustin Bull\nKallie Moore\nKaren Reynolds\nKristy Freeman\nKW \nLaura Sanborn\nLaurel Przybylski\nLeonhardt Wille\nLevi Cai\nLouis O'Neill\nluna \nMary Truland\nmonoirre \nNathan Wright\nNicolette Ray\nNoreen Herrington\nPamela Parker\nRichard Shalumov\nRick Wong\nRobert Amling\nRobert Warner\nRoberta K Wright\nSarah Khalida Mohamad\nSayantan Dasgupta\nSharon Merritt\nShebastian Reyes\nShelley Pearson Cranshaw\nSilvan Wendland\nSonia Tanlimco\nSteven \nSueEllen McCann\nSupernovabetty \nSyniurge \nTea Torvinen\nTierZoo \nTitania Juang\nWhatzGames \n\n\n---+ Follow KQED Science and Deep Look:\n\nPatreon: https://www.patreon.com/deeplook\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/kqedscience/\nTwitter: https://www.twitter.com/kqedscience\nKQED Science on kqed.org: http://www.kqed.org/science\nFacebook Watch: https://www.facebook.com/DeepLookPBS/\n\n---+ About KQED\n\nKQED, an NPR and PBS affiliate in San Francisco, CA, serves Northern California and beyond with a public-supported alternative to commercial TV, Radio and web media.\n\nFunding for Deep Look is provided in part by PBS Digital Studios.

The larvae hitch a ride on the fish for a few weeks, absorbing nutrients from their hosts, until they drop off and begin life as a young mussel on the lake bed.  \n\nIf they\u2019re lucky, the larvae on the fish will make it to the juvenile stage, and grow up to be hardworking living water filters.\n\nAdult mussels can live ten years.

A stick.\n\nBut sometimes it\u2019s not just a stick \u2014 but a walking stick. This non-native insect, originally from India, relies on clever camouflage to hide from predators. They\u2019re so skilled at remaining undercover, you may not have noticed that they\u2019ve made themselves right at home in your local park.\nSome Bay Area researchers are studying the insects\u2019 genetics to learn more about how they are such masters of camouflage.\n\n\"I can't think of any other insect as effective as they are in remaining hidden in plain sight,\" said Edward Ramirez, an undergraduate researcher at the University of California, Berkeley who is currently studying the genetics of Indian walking sticks.\n\"How is this possible? was always the question that came to mind, so I wanted to search for a more clear answer.\"\n\n--- Are there male Indian walking sticks?\nThere\u2019s been no observable males, most likely due to the fact females are parthenogenic and don\u2019t need a male to mate. They can just keep laying eggs without sexual fertilization and create hundreds of female offspring, which drastically alters the ratio of males to females. \n\n--- Are there any walking stick species with males?\nIf the breeding conditions are right, males occur more frequently in the following three species: Australian stick insects (Extatosoma tiaratum), Jungle nymphs (Heteropteryx dilatata) and a species from Madagascar (Achrioptera fallax).\n\n--- What are some of the pros and cons of parthenogenic reproduction?\nFemales can spend more time and energy looking for food and shelter instead of a mate, and they can reproduce faster and thus have a larger population size compared to species that require sexual reproduction. But they can have a lack of genetic variation since they don\u2019t pass genes from separate individuals, and asexual reproduction may not be able to remove harmful mutations that could arise in the genome. \n\n---+ Read the entire article on KQED Science:\n\nhttps://www.kqed.org/science/1958912/walking-sticks-stop-drop-and-clone-to-survive/\n\n---+ For more information:\n\nhttps://essig.berkeley.edu/\n\n---+ Shoutout!\n\n \ud83c\udfc6Congratulations\ud83c\udfc6 to the following fans on our Deep Look Community Tab for coming up with the best names - as decided by fellow Deep Peeps - for a sweet walking stick dance move:\n\nOmar J Playz\n\"Getting Sticky With It\" \n\nSkyman 58\n\"The Wooden Wobble\"\n\nAkasaka Ryuuwai\n\"My tall friend at the club\"\n\nJordi Folland\n\"Twiggle Wiggle\"\n\nloveless\n\"Incognito chopsticks\"\n\nAND an honorable mention goes to:\n\nShahzebfarrukh\n\"the corono-dance (considering how they are keeping the distance) - A PSA by Deep look\"\n\n---+ Thank you to our Top Patreon Supporters ($10+ per month)!

They even clone themselves into a surprising variety of colors to stay hidden in plain sight from predators.\n\nPlease join our community on Patreon! https://www.patreon.com/deeplook\nSUBSCRIBE to Deep Look! http://goo.gl/8NwXqt\n\nDEEP LOOK is a ultra-HD (4K) short video series created by KQED San Francisco and presented by PBS Digital Studios. See the unseen at the very edge of our visible world. Explore big scientific mysteries by going incredibly small.\n\n---\nThere\u2019s that old cheesy joke: What\u2019s brown and sticky? A stick.\n\nBut sometimes it\u2019s not just a stick \u2014 but a walking stick. This non-native insect, originally from India, relies on clever camouflage to hide from predators. They\u2019re so skilled at remaining undercover, you may not have noticed that they\u2019ve made themselves right at home in your local park.\nSome Bay Area researchers are studying the insects\u2019 genetics to learn more about how they are such masters of camouflage.\n\n\"I can't think of any other insect as effective as they are in remaining hidden in plain sight,\" said Edward Ramirez, an undergraduate researcher at the University of California, Berkeley who is currently studying the genetics of Indian walking sticks.\n\"How is this possible? was always the question that came to mind, so I wanted to search for a more clear answer.\"\n\n--- Are there male Indian walking sticks?\nThere\u2019s been no observable males, most likely due to the fact females are parthenogenic and don\u2019t need a male to mate. They can just keep laying eggs without sexual fertilization and create hundreds of female offspring, which drastically alters the ratio of males to females. \n\n--- Are there any walking stick species with males?\nIf the breeding conditions are right, males occur more frequently in the following three species: Australian stick insects (Extatosoma tiaratum), Jungle nymphs (Heteropteryx dilatata) and a species from Madagascar (Achrioptera fallax).\n\n--- What are some of the pros and cons of parthenogenic reproduction?\nFemales can spend more time and energy looking for food and shelter instead of a mate, and they can reproduce faster and thus have a larger population size compared to species that require sexual reproduction. But they can have a lack of genetic variation since they don\u2019t pass genes from separate individuals, and asexual reproduction may not be able to remove harmful mutations that could arise in the genome. \n\n---+ Read the entire article on KQED Science:\n\nhttps://www.kqed.org/science/1958912/walking-sticks-stop-drop-and-clone-to-survive/\n\n---+ For more information:\n\nhttps://essig.berkeley.edu/\n\n---+ Shoutout!\n\n \ud83c\udfc6Congratulations\ud83c\udfc6 to the following fans on our Deep Look Community Tab for coming up with the best names - as decided by fellow Deep Peeps - for a sweet walking stick dance move:\n\nOmar J Playz\n\"Getting Sticky With It\" \n\nSkyman 58\n\"The Wooden Wobble\"\n\nAkasaka Ryuuwai\n\"My tall friend at the club\"\n\nJordi Folland\n\"Twiggle Wiggle\"\n\nloveless\n\"Incognito chopsticks\"\n\nAND an honorable mention goes to:\n\nShahzebfarrukh\n\"the corono-dance (considering how they are keeping the distance) - A PSA by Deep look\"\n\n---+ Thank you to our Top Patreon Supporters ($10+ per month)!

When those young fleas mature they may reinfest the pet.\n\n---+ Read the entire article on KQED Science:\n\nhttps://www.kqed.org/science/1957872/a-fleas-fantastic-jump-takes-more-than-muscle\n\n---+ For more information:\n\nWhy do Large Animals Never Actuate Their Jumps with Latch-Mediated Springs?

Some are pets \u2013 like the Madagascar hissing cockroach.\nThey can be bought at pet stores or online for $5 or less. They don\u2019t bite and don\u2019t carry diseases. They are also much larger than the run-of-the-mill roach, with adults averaging about 3 inches long. They live up to five years. They are slow-moving and mellow \u2013 kind of like an old tabby cat.

A female tsetse fly pushes out a single squiggly larva almost as big as herself, which she nourished with her own milk.\n\nPlease join our community on Patreon! https://www.patreon.com/deeplook\nSUBSCRIBE to Deep Look! http://goo.gl/8NwXqt\n\nDEEP LOOK is a ultra-HD (4K) short video series created by KQED San Francisco and presented by PBS Digital Studios. See the unseen at the very edge of our visible world. Explore big scientific mysteries by going incredibly small.\n\n---\nMammalian moms aren\u2019t the only ones to deliver babies and feed them milk. Tsetse flies, the insects best known for transmitting sleeping sickness, do it too.\n\nA researcher at the University of California, Davis is trying to understand in detail the unusual way in which these flies reproduce in order to find new ways to combat the disease, which has a crippling effect on a huge swath of Africa.\n\nWhen it\u2019s time to give birth, a female tsetse fly takes less than a minute to push out a squiggly yellowish larva almost as big as itself. The first time he watched a larva emerge from its mother, UC Davis medical entomologist Geoff Attardo was reminded of a clown car.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s too much coming out of it to be able to fit inside,\u201d he recalled thinking. \u201cThe fact that they can do it eight times in their lifetime is kind of amazing to me.\u201d\n\nTsetse flies live four to five months and deliver those eight offspring one at a time. While the larva is growing inside them, they feed it milk. This reproductive strategy is extremely rare in the insect world, where survival usually depends on laying hundreds or thousands of eggs.\n\n--- What is sleeping sickness?\n\nTsetse flies, which are only found in Africa, feed exclusively on the blood of humans and other domestic and wild animals. As they feed, they can transmit microscopic parasites called trypanosomes, which cause sleeping sickness in humans and a version of the disease known as nagana in cattle and other livestock. Sleeping sickness is also known as human African trypanosomiasis. \n\n--- What are the symptoms of sleeping sickness?\n\nThe disease starts with fatigue, anemia and headaches. It is treatable with medication, but if trypanosomes invade the central nervous system they can cause sleep disruptions and hallucinations and eventually make patients fall into a coma and die.\n\n---+ Read the entire article on KQED Science:\n\nhttps://www.kqed.org/science/1956004/a-tsetse-fly-births-one-enormous-milk-fed-baby\n\n---+ More Great Deep Look episodes:\n\n\u201cParasites Are Dynamite\u201d Deep Look playlist:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2Jw5ib-s_I&list=PLdKlciEDdCQACmrtvWX7hr7X7Zv8F4nEi\n\n---+ Shoutout!\n\n\ud83c\udfc6Congratulations \ud83c\udfc6to these fans on our YouTube community tab who correctly identified the function of the black protuberances on a tsetse fly larva - polypneustic lobes: \n\nJeffrey Kuo\nLizzie Zelaya\nArt3mis YT\nGaren Reynolds\nTorterra Grey8\n\nDespite looking like a head, they\u2019re actually located at the back of the larva, which used them to breathe while growing inside its mother.

A female tsetse fly pushes out a single squiggly larva almost as big as herself, which she nourished with her own milk.\n\nPlease join our community on Patreon! https://www.patreon.com/deeplook\nSUBSCRIBE to Deep Look! http://goo.gl/8NwXqt\n\nDEEP LOOK is a ultra-HD (4K) short video series created by KQED San Francisco and presented by PBS Digital Studios. See the unseen at the very edge of our visible world. Explore big scientific mysteries by going incredibly small.\n\n---\nMammalian moms aren\u2019t the only ones to deliver babies and feed them milk. Tsetse flies, the insects best known for transmitting sleeping sickness, do it too.\n\nA researcher at the University of California, Davis is trying to understand in detail the unusual way in which these flies reproduce in order to find new ways to combat the disease, which has a crippling effect on a huge swath of Africa.\n\nWhen it\u2019s time to give birth, a female tsetse fly takes less than a minute to push out a squiggly yellowish larva almost as big as itself. The first time he watched a larva emerge from its mother, UC Davis medical entomologist Geoff Attardo was reminded of a clown car.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s too much coming out of it to be able to fit inside,\u201d he recalled thinking. \u201cThe fact that they can do it eight times in their lifetime is kind of amazing to me.\u201d\n\nTsetse flies live four to five months and deliver those eight offspring one at a time. While the larva is growing inside them, they feed it milk. This reproductive strategy is extremely rare in the insect world, where survival usually depends on laying hundreds or thousands of eggs.\n\n--- What is sleeping sickness?\n\nTsetse flies, which are only found in Africa, feed exclusively on the blood of humans and other domestic and wild animals. As they feed, they can transmit microscopic parasites called trypanosomes, which cause sleeping sickness in humans and a version of the disease known as nagana in cattle and other livestock. Sleeping sickness is also known as human African trypanosomiasis. \n\n--- What are the symptoms of sleeping sickness?\n\nThe disease starts with fatigue, anemia and headaches. It is treatable with medication, but if trypanosomes invade the central nervous system they can cause sleep disruptions and hallucinations and eventually make patients fall into a coma and die.\n\n---+ Read the entire article on KQED Science:\n\nhttps://www.kqed.org/science/1956004/a-tsetse-fly-births-one-enormous-milk-fed-baby\n\n---+ More Great Deep Look episodes:\n\n\u201cParasites Are Dynamite\u201d Deep Look playlist:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2Jw5ib-s_I&list=PLdKlciEDdCQACmrtvWX7hr7X7Zv8F4nEi\n\n---+ Shoutout!\n\n\ud83c\udfc6Congratulations \ud83c\udfc6to these fans on our YouTube community tab who correctly identified the function of the black protuberances on a tsetse fly larva - polypneustic lobes: \n\nJeffrey Kuo\nLizzie Zelaya\nArt3mis YT\nGaren Reynolds\nTorterra Grey8\n\nDespite looking like a head, they\u2019re actually located at the back of the larva, which used them to breathe while growing inside its mother.

In December, he published his findings in the journal Zootaxa, identifying 35 species of field crickets in the western states, including 17 new species. California alone hosts 12 species. But many closely resemble the others. So even for one of the nation\u2019s top experts, telling them apart isn\u2019t a simple task.\n\n\u201cIt turns out song is a good way to differentiate,\u201d Weissman said.\n\n--- How do crickets chirp?\n\nOn the underside of male crickets\u2019 wings there\u2019s a vein that sticks up covered in tiny microscopic teeth, all in a row. It\u2019s called the file. There's a hard edge on the lower wing called the scraper.\n\nWhen he rubs his wings together - the scraper on the bottom wing grates across all those little teeth on the top wing. It\u2019s like running your thumb down the teeth of a comb. This process of making sound is called stridulation.\n\n--- How do crickets hear?\nCrickets have tiny ears, called tympana on each of their two front legs. They use them to listen for danger and to hear each other calling. \n\n--- Why do crickets chirp?\nCrickets have several different types of songs that serve different purposes. The familiar repetitive chirping song is a mating call that male crickets produce to attract females that search for potential mates. \n\nIf a female makes physical contact with a male he will typically switch to a second higher-pitched,  quieter courtship song.\n\nIf instead a male cricket comes in contact with another adult male he will let out an angry-sounding rivalry call to tell his competitor to back off.\n\n---+ Read the entire article on KQED Science:\n\nhttps://ww2.kqed.org/science/2020/01/14/crickets-chirp-to-flirt/\n\n---+ For more information:\n\nProfessor Fernando Montealegre-Z\u2019s bioacoustics lab \nhttp://bioacousticssensorybiology.weebly.com/\n\nDavid Weissman\u2019s article cataloging  field crickets in the U.S. \nhttps://www.biotaxa.org/Zootaxa/article/view/zootaxa.4705.1.1\n\n---+ Shoutout!\n\n\ud83c\udfc6Congratulations \ud83c\udfc6to the following fans on our YouTube community tab for correctly identifying the name and function of the kidney bean-shaped structure on the cricket\u2019s tibia - the tympanum, or tympanal organ:\n\nsjhall2009\nDamian Porter\nLittleDreamerRem\nRed Segui\nBa Ri\n\n---+ Thank you to our Top Patreon Supporters ($10+ per month)!\n\nAlice Kwok\nAllen\nAmber Miller\nAurora\nAurora Mitchell\nBarbara Pinney\nBethany\nBill Cass\nBlanca Vides\nBurt Humburg\nCaitlin McDonough\nCarlos Carrasco\nChris B Emrick\nChris Murphy\nCindy McGill\nCompanion Cube\nDaisuke Goto\nDaniel Weinstein\nDavid Deshpande\nDean Skoglund\nEdwin Rivas\nEgg-Roll\nElizabeth Ann Ditz\nGeidi Rodriguez\nGerardo Alfaro\nGuillaume Morin\nJane Orbuch\nJoao Ascensao\njohanna reis\nJohn King\nJohnnyonnyful\nJosh Kuroda\nJoshua Murallon Robertson\nJustin Bull\nKallie Moore\nKaren Reynolds\nKatherine Schick\nKathleen R Jaroma\nKendall Rasmussen\nKristy Freeman\nKW\nKyle Fisher\nLaura Sanborn\nLaurel Przybylski\nLeonhardt Wille\nLevi Cai\nLouis O'Neill\nluna\nMary Truland\nmonoirre\nNatalie Banach\nNathan Wright\nNicolette Ray\nNikita\nNoreen Herrington\nOsbaldo Olvera\nPamela Parker\nRichard Shalumov\nRick Wong\nRobert Amling\nRobert Warner\nRoberta K Wright\nSarah Khalida Mohamad\nSayantan Dasgupta\nShelley Pearson Cranshaw\nSilvan Wendland\nSonia Tanlimco\nSueEllen McCann\nSupernovabetty\nSyniurge\nTea Torvinen\nTierZoo\nTitania Juang\nTrae Wright\nTwo Box Fish\nWhatzGames\n\n---+ About KQED\n\nKQED, an NPR and PBS affiliate in San Francisco, CA, serves Northern California and beyond with a public-supported alternative to commercial TV, Radio and web media.\n\nFunding for Deep Look is provided in part by PBS Digital Studios.

                "description": "Every fall, male tarantulas leave home for good with one thing on their minds: sex. But before these spiders can make the ultimate connection, they have to survive the perils of the open road...which include their potential mates.\n\nPlease join our community on Patreon! https://www.patreon.com/deeplook\nSUBSCRIBE to Deep Look! http://goo.gl/8NwXqt\n\nDEEP LOOK is a ultra-HD (4K) short video series created by KQED San Francisco and presented by PBS Digital Studios. See the unseen at the very edge of our visible world. Explore big scientific mysteries by going incredibly small.\n\n--\n\nEvery September, a generation of newly mature male tarantulas leave their underground homes to wander the landscape south of La Junta, Colorado, to look for mates. The lucky males will find females, who remain near their dens the whole lives, and possibly mate. But this so-called \u201cmigration\u201d is a one\u2010way trip.\n\nAmong the many risks for these itinerant tarantulas, besides running out of time and becoming roadkill, are the local tarantula hawks. The two\u2010inch long, blue\u2010and\u2010gold wasps pounce on the unsuspecting arachnid travelers, hit them with a paralyzing sting, then drag them off to their lairs. Once there, the female wasp lays an egg on the spider that eventually hatches into a larva. The larva burrows inside him to feast and grow before emerging from his body, Alien\u2010like, as an adult.\n\nIf a male does survive long enough to find a den, he courts the female by first \u201cknocking\u201d at the entrance by tapping the ground with his front mouth parts, called pedipalps. He must rely on vibration to communicate his intentions, since tarantulas are mostly blind. If the larger and more dangerous female comes out to investigate, they face off at the den entrance. She may reply with drumming of her own to indicate that she\u2019s receptive \u2010\u2010 or she might try to eat him.\n\nBut he\u2019s come prepared. When male tarantulas reach maturity, right before they set out on their quest, they develop a special set of clasps on their front legs called \u201ctibial hooks.\u201d Tibial hooks serve a single purpose: to fasten underneath the female\u2019s fangs during courtship, allowing him to keep danger at arm\u2019s length, so to speak.\n\n--- Are tarantulas dangerous?\n\nThough they do have venom, tarantulas don\u2019t typically bite humans. If they do, the bite hurts no more than a papercut.\n\n--- How long do tarantulas live?\n\nThe adult males of this species usually only live ten years, but females can live much longer, 30-40 years.\n\n---+ Read the entire article on KQED Science:\n\nhttps://www.kqed.org/science/1950117/tarantulas-take-hooking-up-to-the-next-level\n\n---+ For more information:\n\nVisit the Colorado State University Bug Zoo site:\nhttps://bspm.agsci.colostate.edu/the-bug-zoo/\n\n---+ More Great Deep Look episodes about spiders:\n\nTurret Spiders Launch Sneak Attacks From Tiny Towers\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bEjYunwByw\n\nWhy the Male Black Widow is a Real Home Wrecker\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NpJNeGqExrc\n\n---+ Shoutout!\n\n\ud83c\udfc6Congratulations \ud83c\udfc6to the following fans on our YouTube community tab for correctly identifying the body part that male tarantulas use for drumming up interest from females - the pedipalps!\n\nMitchel Castellon\nTheWhiteScatterbug\nIan B\nDragim Yutto\nLydia Liu\n\n---+ Thank you to our Top Patreon Supporters ($10+ per month)!\n\nAlice Kwok\nAurora\nBethany\nBill Cass\nCaitlin McDonough\nCameron\nCarlos Carrasco\nChris B Emrick\nCindy McGill\nDaisuke Goto\nDaniel Weinstein\nDavid Deshpande\nDavid Esperanza\nDean Skoglund\nEgg-Roll\nElizabeth Ann Ditz\nGerardo Alfaro\nGuillaume Morin\nIvan Alexander\nJane Orbuch\nJanetFromAnotherPlanet\njohanna reis\nJohnnyonnyful\nJoshua Murallon Robertson\nKallie Moore\nKaren Reynolds\nKendall Rasmussen\nKristy Freeman\nKW\nLaura Sanborn\nLaurel Przybylski\nLeonhardt Wille\nLevi Cai\nlunafaaye\nMary Truland\nmonoirre\nNatalie Banach\nNathan Wright\nNikita\nPamela Parker\nRichard Shalumov\nRick Wong\nRobert Amling\nRobert Warner\nRoberta K Wright\nSayantan Dasgupta\nShelley Pearson Cranshaw\nShirley Washburn\nSilvan Wendland\nSonia Tanlimco\nSupernovabetty\nSyniurge\nTea Torvinen\nTitania Juang\nTrae Wright\nTwo Box Fish\n\n---+ Follow KQED Science and Deep Look:\n\nPatreon: https://www.patreon.com/deeplook\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/kqedscience/\nTwitter: https://www.twitter.com/kqedscience\nKQED Science on kqed.org: http://www.kqed.org/science\nFacebook Watch: https://www.facebook.com/DeepLookPBS/\n\n---+ About KQED\n\nKQED, an NPR and PBS affiliate in San Francisco, CA, serves Northern California and beyond with a public-supported alternative to commercial TV, Radio and web media.\n\nFunding for Deep Look is provided in part by PBS Digital Studios.

                    "description": "Every fall, male tarantulas leave home for good with one thing on their minds: sex. But before these spiders can make the ultimate connection, they have to survive the perils of the open road...which include their potential mates.\n\nPlease join our community on Patreon! https://www.patreon.com/deeplook\nSUBSCRIBE to Deep Look! http://goo.gl/8NwXqt\n\nDEEP LOOK is a ultra-HD (4K) short video series created by KQED San Francisco and presented by PBS Digital Studios. See the unseen at the very edge of our visible world. Explore big scientific mysteries by going incredibly small.\n\n--\n\nEvery September, a generation of newly mature male tarantulas leave their underground homes to wander the landscape south of La Junta, Colorado, to look for mates. The lucky males will find females, who remain near their dens the whole lives, and possibly mate. But this so-called \u201cmigration\u201d is a one\u2010way trip.\n\nAmong the many risks for these itinerant tarantulas, besides running out of time and becoming roadkill, are the local tarantula hawks. The two\u2010inch long, blue\u2010and\u2010gold wasps pounce on the unsuspecting arachnid travelers, hit them with a paralyzing sting, then drag them off to their lairs. Once there, the female wasp lays an egg on the spider that eventually hatches into a larva. The larva burrows inside him to feast and grow before emerging from his body, Alien\u2010like, as an adult.\n\nIf a male does survive long enough to find a den, he courts the female by first \u201cknocking\u201d at the entrance by tapping the ground with his front mouth parts, called pedipalps. He must rely on vibration to communicate his intentions, since tarantulas are mostly blind. If the larger and more dangerous female comes out to investigate, they face off at the den entrance. She may reply with drumming of her own to indicate that she\u2019s receptive \u2010\u2010 or she might try to eat him.\n\nBut he\u2019s come prepared. When male tarantulas reach maturity, right before they set out on their quest, they develop a special set of clasps on their front legs called \u201ctibial hooks.\u201d Tibial hooks serve a single purpose: to fasten underneath the female\u2019s fangs during courtship, allowing him to keep danger at arm\u2019s length, so to speak.\n\n--- Are tarantulas dangerous?\n\nThough they do have venom, tarantulas don\u2019t typically bite humans. If they do, the bite hurts no more than a papercut.\n\n--- How long do tarantulas live?\n\nThe adult males of this species usually only live ten years, but females can live much longer, 30-40 years.\n\n---+ Read the entire article on KQED Science:\n\nhttps://www.kqed.org/science/1950117/tarantulas-take-hooking-up-to-the-next-level\n\n---+ For more information:\n\nVisit the Colorado State University Bug Zoo site:\nhttps://bspm.agsci.colostate.edu/the-bug-zoo/\n\n---+ More Great Deep Look episodes about spiders:\n\nTurret Spiders Launch Sneak Attacks From Tiny Towers\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bEjYunwByw\n\nWhy the Male Black Widow is a Real Home Wrecker\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NpJNeGqExrc\n\n---+ Shoutout!\n\n\ud83c\udfc6Congratulations \ud83c\udfc6to the following fans on our YouTube community tab for correctly identifying the body part that male tarantulas use for drumming up interest from females - the pedipalps!\n\nMitchel Castellon\nTheWhiteScatterbug\nIan B\nDragim Yutto\nLydia Liu\n\n---+ Thank you to our Top Patreon Supporters ($10+ per month)!\n\nAlice Kwok\nAurora\nBethany\nBill Cass\nCaitlin McDonough\nCameron\nCarlos Carrasco\nChris B Emrick\nCindy McGill\nDaisuke Goto\nDaniel Weinstein\nDavid Deshpande\nDavid Esperanza\nDean Skoglund\nEgg-Roll\nElizabeth Ann Ditz\nGerardo Alfaro\nGuillaume Morin\nIvan Alexander\nJane Orbuch\nJanetFromAnotherPlanet\njohanna reis\nJohnnyonnyful\nJoshua Murallon Robertson\nKallie Moore\nKaren Reynolds\nKendall Rasmussen\nKristy Freeman\nKW\nLaura Sanborn\nLaurel Przybylski\nLeonhardt Wille\nLevi Cai\nlunafaaye\nMary Truland\nmonoirre\nNatalie Banach\nNathan Wright\nNikita\nPamela Parker\nRichard Shalumov\nRick Wong\nRobert Amling\nRobert Warner\nRoberta K Wright\nSayantan Dasgupta\nShelley Pearson Cranshaw\nShirley Washburn\nSilvan Wendland\nSonia Tanlimco\nSupernovabetty\nSyniurge\nTea Torvinen\nTitania Juang\nTrae Wright\nTwo Box Fish\n\n---+ Follow KQED Science and Deep Look:\n\nPatreon: https://www.patreon.com/deeplook\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/kqedscience/\nTwitter: https://www.twitter.com/kqedscience\nKQED Science on kqed.org: http://www.kqed.org/science\nFacebook Watch: https://www.facebook.com/DeepLookPBS/\n\n---+ About KQED\n\nKQED, an NPR and PBS affiliate in San Francisco, CA, serves Northern California and beyond with a public-supported alternative to commercial TV, Radio and web media.\n\nFunding for Deep Look is provided in part by PBS Digital Studios.

Now the spores just need to get into another fly to grow.\n\n--- Could this or a similar fungus \u201czombify\u201d humans?\n\u201cNo, it's very unlikely,\u201d Elya said. \u201cWe can control our bodily temperature to kill invaders.\u201d\n\n-- Can we use the fungus as biological control?\nResearchers have tried, but the spores are too fragile to grow in the lab.\n\n---+ Read the entire article on KQED Science: \nhttps://www.kqed.org/science/1949314/this-killer-fungus-turns-flies-into-zombies\n\n---+ Shoutout! \n\n\ud83c\udfc6Congratulations\ud83c\udfc6 to the following fans on our Deep Look Community Tab for coming up with the top titles - as decided by fellow Deep Peeps - for a horror movie starring this fungus:\n\nJoginiz - \"Flyday the 13th'\nKingXDragoon - \"Pretty Fly for a dead guy\ufeff\"\nLaura Garrard - The Fungus Among Us!!\ufeff\nLysiasolo - \"Parafungal activity\ufeff\"\nDe paus van de Lilith Kerk - The whitecorpse horror (as an ode to HP Lovecraft \"the Dunwich horror\")\ufeff\n\n---+ Thank you to our Top Patreon Supporters ($10+ per month)! \n\nTrae Wright\nJustin Bull\nBill Cass\nAlice Kwok\nSarah Khalida Mohamad\nStefficael Uebelhart\nDaniel Weinstein\nChris B Emrick\nSeghan Seer\nKaren Reynolds\nTea Torvinen\nDavid Deshpande\nDaisuke Goto\nAmber Miller\nCompanion Cube\nWhatzGames\nRichard Shalumov\nElizabeth Ann Ditz\nRobert Amling\nGerardo Alfaro\nMary Truland\nShirley Washburn\nRobert Warner\njohanna reis\nSupernovabetty\nKendall Rasmussen\nSayantan Dasgupta\nCindy McGill\nLeonhardt Wille\nJoshua Murallon Robertson\nPamela Parker\nRoberta K Wright\nShelley Pearson Cranshaw\nKW\nSilvan Wendland\nTwo Box Fish\nJohnnyonnyful\nAurora\nGeorge Koutros\nmonoirre\nDean Skoglund\nSonia Tanlimco\nGuillaume Morin\nIvan Alexander\nLaurel Przybylski\nAllen\nJane Orbuch\nRick Wong\nLevi Cai\nTitania Juang\nNathan Wright\nSyniurge\nCarl\nKallie Moore\nMichael Mieczkowski\nKyle Fisher\nGeidi Rodriguez\nJanetFromAnotherPlanet\nSueEllen McCann\nDaisy Trevino \nJeanne Sommer\nLouis O'Neill\nriceeater\nKatherine Schick\nAurora Mitchell\nCory\nNousernamepls\nChris Murphy\nPM Daeley\nJoao Ascensao\nNicolette Ray\nTierZoo\n\n---+ Follow KQED Science and Deep Look:\n\nPatreon: https://www.patreon.com/deeplook\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/kqedscience/\nTwitter: https://www.twitter.com/kqedscience\nKQED Science on kqed.org: http://www.kqed.org/science\nFacebook Watch: https://www.facebook.com/DeepLookPBS/\n\n---+ About KQED\n\nKQED, an NPR and PBS affiliate in San Francisco, CA, serves Northern California and beyond with a public-supported alternative to commercial TV, radio and web media.\n\nFunding for Deep Look is provided in part by PBS Digital Studios.

                "description": "Kidnapper ants raid other ant species' colonies, abduct their young and take them back to their nest. When the enslaved babies grow up, the kidnappers trick them into serving their captors \u2013 hunting, cleaning the nest, even chewing up their food for them.\n\nPlease join our community on Patreon! https://www.patreon.com/deeplook\nSUBSCRIBE to Deep Look! http://goo.gl/8NwXqt\n\nDEEP LOOK is a ultra-HD (4K) short video series created by KQED San Francisco and presented by PBS Digital Studios. See the unseen at the very edge of our visible world. Explore big scientific mysteries by going incredibly small.\n\nA miniature drama is playing out on the forest floor in California\u2019s preeminent mountain range, the Sierra Nevada, at this time of year. As the sun sets, look closely and you might see a stream of red ants frantically climbing over leaves and rocks.\n\nThey aren\u2019t looking for food. They\u2019re looking for other ants. They\u2019re kidnappers.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s hard to know who you're rooting for in this situation,\u201d says Kelsey Scheckel, a graduate student at UC Berkeley who studies kidnapper ants. \u201cYou're just excited to be a bystander.\u201d\n\nOn this late summer afternoon, Scheckel stares intently over the landscape at the Sagehen Creek Field Station, part of the University of California\u2019s Natural Reserve System, near Truckee, California.\u201cThe first thing we do is try to find a colony with two very different-looking species cohabitating,\u201d Scheckel says.\n\n\u201cThat type of coexistence is pretty rare. As soon as we find that, we can get excited.\u201d\n\n--- How do ants communicate?\nAnts mostly use their sense of smell to learn about the world around themselves and to recognize nestmates from intruders. They don\u2019t have noses. Instead, they use their antennae to sense chemicals on surfaces and in the air. Ants\u2019 antennae are porous like a kitchen sponge allowing chemicals to enter and activate receptors inside. You will often see ants tap each other with their antennae. That behavior, called antennation, helps them recognize nestmates who will share the same chemical nest signature.\n\n---Can ants bite or sting?\nMany ants will use their mandibles, or jaws, to defend themselves but that typically just feels like a pinch.

When the enslaved babies grow up, the kidnappers trick them into serving their captors \u2013 hunting, cleaning the nest, even chewing up their food for them.\n\nPlease join our community on Patreon! https://www.patreon.com/deeplook\nSUBSCRIBE to Deep Look! http://goo.gl/8NwXqt\n\nDEEP LOOK is a ultra-HD (4K) short video series created by KQED San Francisco and presented by PBS Digital Studios. See the unseen at the very edge of our visible world. Explore big scientific mysteries by going incredibly small.\n\nA miniature drama is playing out on the forest floor in California\u2019s preeminent mountain range, the Sierra Nevada, at this time of year. As the sun sets, look closely and you might see a stream of red ants frantically climbing over leaves and rocks.\n\nThey aren\u2019t looking for food. They\u2019re looking for other ants. They\u2019re kidnappers.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s hard to know who you're rooting for in this situation,\u201d says Kelsey Scheckel, a graduate student at UC Berkeley who studies kidnapper ants. \u201cYou're just excited to be a bystander.\u201d\n\nOn this late summer afternoon, Scheckel stares intently over the landscape at the Sagehen Creek Field Station, part of the University of California\u2019s Natural Reserve System, near Truckee, California.\u201cThe first thing we do is try to find a colony with two very different-looking species cohabitating,\u201d Scheckel says.\n\n\u201cThat type of coexistence is pretty rare. As soon as we find that, we can get excited.\u201d\n\n--- How do ants communicate?\nAnts mostly use their sense of smell to learn about the world around themselves and to recognize nestmates from intruders. They don\u2019t have noses. Instead, they use their antennae to sense chemicals on surfaces and in the air. Ants\u2019 antennae are porous like a kitchen sponge allowing chemicals to enter and activate receptors inside. You will often see ants tap each other with their antennae. That behavior, called antennation, helps them recognize nestmates who will share the same chemical nest signature.\n\n---Can ants bite or sting?\nMany ants will use their mandibles, or jaws, to defend themselves but that typically just feels like a pinch. Some ants have a stinger at the end of their abdomen that can deliver a venomous sting. While the type of venom can vary across species, many ants\u2019 sting contains formic acid which causes a burning sensation. Some have special glands containing acid that can spray at attackers causing burning and alarming odors.\n\n---+ Read the entire article on KQED Science:\n\nhttps://www.kqed.org/science/1947369/kidnapper-ants-steal-other-ants-babies-and-brainwash-them\n\n---+ For more information:\n\nNeil Tsutsui Lab of Evolution, Ecology and Behavior of Social Insects at the University of California, Berkeley\nhttps://nature.berkeley.edu/tsutsuilab/\n\n---+ Shoutout!\n\n\ud83c\udfc6Congratulations \ud83c\udfc6to the following fans for correctly naming and describing the inter-species, mandible-to-mandible ant behavior we showed on our Deep Look Community Tab\u2026 \"trophallaxis:\"\n\nSenpai\nRavinraven6913\nCJ Thibeau\nMaksimilian Ta\u0161ler\nIsha\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UC-3SbfTPJsL8fJAPKiVqBLg/community?lb=Ugy57BQZzqfuE-32aCt4AaABCQ\n\n---+ Thank you to our Top Patreon Supporters ($10+ per month)!\n\nLeonhardt Wille\nJustin Bull\nBill Cass\nSarah Khalida Mohamad\nDaniel Weinstein\nChris B Emrick\nKaren Reynolds\nTea Torvinen\nDavid Deshpande\nDaisuke Goto\nCompanion Cube\nWhatzGames\nRichard Shalumov\nElizabeth Ann Ditz\nGerardo Alfaro\nRobert Amling\nShirley Washburn\nRobert Warner\nSupernovabetty\njohanna reis\nKendall Rasmussen\nPamela Parker\nSayantan Dasgupta\nJoshua Murallon Robertson\nCindy McGill\nKenia Villegas\nShelley Pearson Cranshaw\nAurora\nDean Skoglund\nSilvan Wendland\nIvan Alexander\nmonoirre\nSonia Tanlimco\nTwo Box Fish\nJane Orbuch\nAllen\nLaurel Przybylski\nJohnnyonnyful\nRick Wong\nLevi Cai\nTitania Juang\nNathan Wright\nCarl\nMichael Mieczkowski\nKyle Fisher\nJanetFromAnotherPlanet\nKallie Moore\nSueEllen McCann\nGeidi Rodriguez\nLouis O'Neill\nEdwin Rivas\nJeanne Sommer\nKatherine Schick\nAurora Mitchell\nCory\nRicardo Martinez\nriceeater\nDaisy Trevino \nKW\nPM Daeley\nJoao Ascensao\nChris Murphy\nNicolette Ray\nTierZoo\n\n\n---+ Follow KQED Science and Deep Look:\n\nPatreon: https://www.patreon.com/deeplook\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/kqedscience/\nTwitter: https://www.twitter.com/kqedscience\nKQED Science on kqed.org: http://www.kqed.org/science\nFacebook Watch: https://www.facebook.com/DeepLookPBS/\n\n---+ About KQED\n\nKQED, an NPR and PBS affiliate in San Francisco, CA, serves Northern California and beyond with a public-supported alternative to commercial TV, Radio and web media.\n\nFunding for Deep Look is provided in part by PBS Digital Studios.

                "description": "Alfalfa leafcutting bees are way better at pollinating alfalfa flowers than honeybees. They don\u2019t mind getting thwacked in the face by the spring-loaded blooms. And that's good, because hungry cows depend on their hard work to make milk.\n\nJoin our community on Patreon! https://www.patreon.com/deeplook\nPlease take our annual PBSDS Survey, for a chance to win a T-shirt!  https://www.pbsresearch.org/c/r/DL_YTvideo\n\nDEEP LOOK is a ultra-HD (4K) short video series created by KQED San Francisco and presented by PBS Digital Studios. See the unseen at the very edge of our visible world. Explore big scientific mysteries by going incredibly small.\n\n---\n\nSure, cows are important. But next time you eat ice cream, thank a bee. \n\nEvery summer, alfalfa leafcutting bees pollinate alfalfa in an intricate process that gets them thwacked by the flowers when they release the pollen that allows the plants to make seeds. The bees\u2019 hard work came to fruition last week when growers in California finished harvesting the alfalfa seeds that will be grown to make nutritious hay for dairy cows. \n\nThis is how it works.\n\nTo produce alfalfa seeds, farmers let their plants grow until they bloom. They need help pollinating the tiny purple flowers, so that the female and male parts of the flower can come together and produce fertile seeds. That\u2019s where the grayish, easygoing alfalfa leafcutting bees come in. Seed growers in California release the bees \u2013 known simply as cutters \u2013 in June and they work hard for a month. \n\nAlfalfa\u2019s flowers keep their reproductive organs hidden away inside a boat-shaped bottom petal called the keel petal, which is held closed by a thin membrane that creates a spring mechanism.\n\nCutter bees come up to the flower looking for nectar and pollen to feed on. When they land on the flower, the membrane holding the keel petal breaks and the long reproductive structure pops right up and smacks the upper petal or the bee, releasing its yellow pollen. This process is called \u201ctripping the flower.\u201d \n\nWhen the flower is tripped, pollen falls on its female reproductive organ and fertilizes it; bees also carry pollen away on their hairy bodies and help fertilize other flowers. In a few weeks, each flower turns into a curly pod with seven to 10 seeds growing inside.\n\nCutters trip 80 percent of flowers they visit, compared to honeybees, which only trip about 10 percent. \n--- \n\n--- What kind of a plant is alfalfa?\nAlfalfa is a legume, like beans and chickpeas. Other legumes also hold their reproductive organs within a keel petal.\n\n--- What do bees use leaves for?\nAlfalfa leafcutting bees and other leafcutter bees cut leaf and petal pieces to build their nest inside a hole, such as a nook and cranny in a log. Alfalfa farmers provide bees with holes in styrofoam boards. \n\n---+ Read the entire article on KQED Science:\nhttps://www.kqed.org/science/1946996/this-bee-gets-punched-by-flowers-for-your-ice-cream\n\n---+ Shoutout!\n\n \ud83c\udfc6Congratulations \ud83c\udfc6to the following fans for correctly identifying the bee body part coated in pollen, on our Leafcutting Bee - the scopa or scopae!\n\nPunkonthego\nGamingCuzWhyNot\nGalatians 4:16\nGil AGA\nEdison Lewis\n\n---+ Thank you to our Top Patreon Supporters ($10+ per month)!\n\nLeonhardt Wille\nJustin Bull\nBill Cass\nSarah Khalida Mohamad\nDaniel Weinstein\nChris B Emrick\nKaren Reynolds\nTea Torvinen\nDavid Deshpande\nDaisuke Goto\nCompanion Cube\nWhatzGames\nRichard Shalumov\nElizabeth Ann Ditz\nGerardo Alfaro\nRobert Amling\nShirley Washburn\nRobert Warner\nSupernovabetty\njohanna reis\nKendall Rasmussen\nPamela Parker\nSayantan Dasgupta\nJoshua Murallon Robertson\nCindy McGill\nKenia Villegas\nShelley Pearson Cranshaw\nAurora\nDean Skoglund\nSilvan Wendland\nIvan Alexander\nmonoirre\nSonia Tanlimco\nTwo Box Fish\nJane Orbuch\nAllen\nLaurel Przybylski\nJohnnyonnyful\nRick Wong\nLevi Cai\nTitania Juang\nNathan Wright\nCarl\nMichael Mieczkowski\nKyle Fisher\nJanetFromAnotherPlanet\nKallie Moore\nSueEllen McCann\nGeidi Rodriguez\nLouis O'Neill\nEdwin Rivas\nJeanne Sommer\nKatherine Schick\nAurora Mitchell\nCory\nRicardo Martinez\nriceeater\nDaisy Trevino \nKW\nPM Daeley\nJoao Ascensao\nChris Murphy\nNicolette Ray\nTierZoo\n\n\n\n\n---+ Follow KQED Science and Deep Look:\n\nPatreon: https://www.patreon.com/deeplook\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/kqedscience/\nTwitter: https://www.twitter.com/kqedscience\nKQED Science on kqed.org: http://www.kqed.org/science\nFacebook Watch: https://www.facebook.com/DeepLookPBS/\n\n---+ About KQED\n\nKQED, an NPR and PBS affiliate in San Francisco, CA, serves Northern California and beyond with a public-supported alternative to commercial TV, radio and web media.\n\nFunding for Deep Look is provided in part by PBS Digital Studios.

They don\u2019t mind getting thwacked in the face by the spring-loaded blooms. And that's good, because hungry cows depend on their hard work to make milk.\n\nJoin our community on Patreon! https://www.patreon.com/deeplook\nPlease take our annual PBSDS Survey, for a chance to win a T-shirt!  https://www.pbsresearch.org/c/r/DL_YTvideo\n\nDEEP LOOK is a ultra-HD (4K) short video series created by KQED San Francisco and presented by PBS Digital Studios. See the unseen at the very edge of our visible world. Explore big scientific mysteries by going incredibly small.\n\n---\n\nSure, cows are important. But next time you eat ice cream, thank a bee. \n\nEvery summer, alfalfa leafcutting bees pollinate alfalfa in an intricate process that gets them thwacked by the flowers when they release the pollen that allows the plants to make seeds. The bees\u2019 hard work came to fruition last week when growers in California finished harvesting the alfalfa seeds that will be grown to make nutritious hay for dairy cows. \n\nThis is how it works.\n\nTo produce alfalfa seeds, farmers let their plants grow until they bloom. They need help pollinating the tiny purple flowers, so that the female and male parts of the flower can come together and produce fertile seeds. That\u2019s where the grayish, easygoing alfalfa leafcutting bees come in. Seed growers in California release the bees \u2013 known simply as cutters \u2013 in June and they work hard for a month. \n\nAlfalfa\u2019s flowers keep their reproductive organs hidden away inside a boat-shaped bottom petal called the keel petal, which is held closed by a thin membrane that creates a spring mechanism.\n\nCutter bees come up to the flower looking for nectar and pollen to feed on. When they land on the flower, the membrane holding the keel petal breaks and the long reproductive structure pops right up and smacks the upper petal or the bee, releasing its yellow pollen. This process is called \u201ctripping the flower.\u201d \n\nWhen the flower is tripped, pollen falls on its female reproductive organ and fertilizes it; bees also carry pollen away on their hairy bodies and help fertilize other flowers. In a few weeks, each flower turns into a curly pod with seven to 10 seeds growing inside.\n\nCutters trip 80 percent of flowers they visit, compared to honeybees, which only trip about 10 percent. \n--- \n\n--- What kind of a plant is alfalfa?\nAlfalfa is a legume, like beans and chickpeas. Other legumes also hold their reproductive organs within a keel petal.\n\n--- What do bees use leaves for?\nAlfalfa leafcutting bees and other leafcutter bees cut leaf and petal pieces to build their nest inside a hole, such as a nook and cranny in a log. Alfalfa farmers provide bees with holes in styrofoam boards. \n\n---+ Read the entire article on KQED Science:\nhttps://www.kqed.org/science/1946996/this-bee-gets-punched-by-flowers-for-your-ice-cream\n\n---+ Shoutout!\n\n \ud83c\udfc6Congratulations \ud83c\udfc6to the following fans for correctly identifying the bee body part coated in pollen, on our Leafcutting Bee - the scopa or scopae!\n\nPunkonthego\nGamingCuzWhyNot\nGalatians 4:16\nGil AGA\nEdison Lewis\n\n---+ Thank you to our Top Patreon Supporters ($10+ per month)!\n\nLeonhardt Wille\nJustin Bull\nBill Cass\nSarah Khalida Mohamad\nDaniel Weinstein\nChris B Emrick\nKaren Reynolds\nTea Torvinen\nDavid Deshpande\nDaisuke Goto\nCompanion Cube\nWhatzGames\nRichard Shalumov\nElizabeth Ann Ditz\nGerardo Alfaro\nRobert Amling\nShirley Washburn\nRobert Warner\nSupernovabetty\njohanna reis\nKendall Rasmussen\nPamela Parker\nSayantan Dasgupta\nJoshua Murallon Robertson\nCindy McGill\nKenia Villegas\nShelley Pearson Cranshaw\nAurora\nDean Skoglund\nSilvan Wendland\nIvan Alexander\nmonoirre\nSonia Tanlimco\nTwo Box Fish\nJane Orbuch\nAllen\nLaurel Przybylski\nJohnnyonnyful\nRick Wong\nLevi Cai\nTitania Juang\nNathan Wright\nCarl\nMichael Mieczkowski\nKyle Fisher\nJanetFromAnotherPlanet\nKallie Moore\nSueEllen McCann\nGeidi Rodriguez\nLouis O'Neill\nEdwin Rivas\nJeanne Sommer\nKatherine Schick\nAurora Mitchell\nCory\nRicardo Martinez\nriceeater\nDaisy Trevino \nKW\nPM Daeley\nJoao Ascensao\nChris Murphy\nNicolette Ray\nTierZoo\n\n\n\n\n---+ Follow KQED Science and Deep Look:\n\nPatreon: https://www.patreon.com/deeplook\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/kqedscience/\nTwitter: https://www.twitter.com/kqedscience\nKQED Science on kqed.org: http://www.kqed.org/science\nFacebook Watch: https://www.facebook.com/DeepLookPBS/\n\n---+ About KQED\n\nKQED, an NPR and PBS affiliate in San Francisco, CA, serves Northern California and beyond with a public-supported alternative to commercial TV, radio and web media.\n\nFunding for Deep Look is provided in part by PBS Digital Studios.

Each segment is held in place by the one in front and behind it, but the individual segments can move a bit. When the snake shakes its tail, it sends undulating waves down the length of the rattle, and they click against each other.

                "description": "At night, these parasites crawl onto your bed, bite you and suck your blood. Then they find a nearby hideout where they leave disgusting telltale signs. But these pests have an Achilles\u2019 heel that stops them cold.\n\nSUBSCRIBE to Deep Look! http://goo.gl/8NwXqt \nJoin our community on Patreon! https://www.patreon.com/deeplook \n\nDEEP LOOK is a ultra-HD (4K) short video series created by KQED San Francisco and presented by PBS Digital Studios. See the unseen at the very edge of our visible world. Explore big scientific mysteries by going incredibly small.\n\nAdult bed bugs are about the size and color of an apple seed. After biting, they hide in a nearby cranny, like the seam of the mattress.\n\nAt the University of California, Irvine, biologist and engineer Catherine Loudon is working to create synthetic surfaces that could trap bed bugs. She was inspired by the tiny hooked hairs that grow from the leaves of some varieties of beans, such as kidney and green beans. In nature, these hairs, called trichomes, pierce through the feet of the aphids and leafhoppers that like to feed on the plants.\n\nResearchers have found that these pointy hairs are just as effective against bed bugs, even though the bloodsucking parasites don\u2019t feed on leaves. Loudon\u2019s goal is to mimic a bean leaf\u2019s mechanism to create an inexpensive, portable bed bug trap.\n\n\u201cYou could imagine a strip that would act as a barrier that could be placed virtually anywhere: across the portal to a room, behind the headboard, on subway seats, an airplane,\u201d Loudon said. \u201cThey have six legs, so that\u2019s six opportunities to get trapped.\u201d\n\n--- Where do bed bugs come from?\nBed bugs don\u2019t fly or jump or come in from the garden. They crawl very quickly and hide in travelers\u2019 luggage. They also move around on secondhand furniture, or from apartment to apartment.\n\n--- How can I avoid bringing bed bugs home?\n\u201cIt would probably be a prudent thing to do a quick bed check if you\u2019re sleeping in a strange bed,\u201d said Potter. His recommendation goes for hotel rooms, as well as dorms and summer camp bunk beds. He suggests pulling back the sheet at the head of the bed and checking the seams on the top and bottom of the mattress and the box spring. \n\n---+ For more tips, read the entire article on KQED Science:\nhttps://www.kqed.org/science/1944245/watch-bed-bugs-get-stopped-in-their-tracks\n\n---+ More Great Deep Look Episodes:\n\u2018Parasites are Dynamite\u2019 Playlist: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLdKlciEDdCQACmrtvWX7hr7X7Zv8F4nEi\n\n---+  \ud83c\udfc6Congratulations \ud83c\udfc6to the following fans for correctly identifying the creature's species name in our community tab challenge: \n\nStay in Your Layne\nBrian Lee\nBrad Denney\nElise Wade\nRaminta\u2019s Photography\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UC-3SbfTPJsL8fJAPKiVqBLg/community?lb=Ugz37Tnkfr8gOF7tRL54AaABCQ\n\n---+ Thank you to our Top Patreon Supporters ($10+ per month)!\n\nAllen, Aurora Mitchell, Beckie, Ben Espey, Bill Cass, Bluapex, Breanna Tarnawsky, Carl, Chris B Emrick, Chris Murphy, Cindy McGill, Companion Cube, Cory, Daisuke Goto, Daisy Trevino , Daniel Voisine, Daniel Weinstein, David Deshpande, Dean Skoglund, Edwin Rivas, Elizabeth Ann Ditz, Eric Carter, Geidi Rodriguez, Gerardo Alfaro, Ivan Alexander, Jane Orbuch, JanetFromAnotherPlanet, Jason Buberel, Jeanine Womble, Jeanne Sommer, Jiayang Li, Joao Ascensao, johanna reis, Johnnyonnyful, Joshua Murallon Robertson, Justin Bull, Kallie Moore, Karen Reynolds, Katherine Schick, Kendall Rasmussen, Kenia Villegas, Kristell Esquivel, KW, Kyle Fisher, Laurel Przybylski, Levi Cai, Mark Joshua Bernardo, Michael Mieczkowski, Michele Wong, Nathan Padilla, Nathan Wright, Nicolette Ray, Pamela Parker, PM Daeley, Ricardo Martinez, riceeater, Richard Shalumov, Rick Wong, Robert Amling, Robert Warner, Samuel Bean, Sayantan Dasgupta, Sean Tucker, Shelley Pearson Cranshaw, Shirley Washburn, Sonia Tanlimco, SueEllen McCann, Supernovabetty, Tea Torvinen, TierZoo, Titania Juang, Two Box Fish, WhatzGames, Willy Nursalim, Yvan Mostaza\n\n---+ Follow KQED Science and Deep Look:\nPatreon: https://www.patreon.com/deeplook\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/kqedscience/\nTwitter: https://www.twitter.com/kqedscience\nKQED Science on kqed.org: http://www.kqed.org/science\nFacebook Watch: https://www.facebook.com/DeepLookPBS/\n\n---+ About KQED\nKQED, an NPR and PBS affiliate in San Francisco, CA, serves Northern California and beyond with a public-supported alternative to commercial TV, radio and web media.\n\nFunding for Deep Look is provided in part by PBS Digital Studios.

                    "description": "At night, these parasites crawl onto your bed, bite you and suck your blood. Then they find a nearby hideout where they leave disgusting telltale signs. But these pests have an Achilles\u2019 heel that stops them cold.\n\nSUBSCRIBE to Deep Look! http://goo.gl/8NwXqt \nJoin our community on Patreon! https://www.patreon.com/deeplook \n\nDEEP LOOK is a ultra-HD (4K) short video series created by KQED San Francisco and presented by PBS Digital Studios. See the unseen at the very edge of our visible world. Explore big scientific mysteries by going incredibly small.\n\nAdult bed bugs are about the size and color of an apple seed. After biting, they hide in a nearby cranny, like the seam of the mattress.\n\nAt the University of California, Irvine, biologist and engineer Catherine Loudon is working to create synthetic surfaces that could trap bed bugs. She was inspired by the tiny hooked hairs that grow from the leaves of some varieties of beans, such as kidney and green beans. In nature, these hairs, called trichomes, pierce through the feet of the aphids and leafhoppers that like to feed on the plants.\n\nResearchers have found that these pointy hairs are just as effective against bed bugs, even though the bloodsucking parasites don\u2019t feed on leaves. Loudon\u2019s goal is to mimic a bean leaf\u2019s mechanism to create an inexpensive, portable bed bug trap.\n\n\u201cYou could imagine a strip that would act as a barrier that could be placed virtually anywhere: across the portal to a room, behind the headboard, on subway seats, an airplane,\u201d Loudon said. \u201cThey have six legs, so that\u2019s six opportunities to get trapped.\u201d\n\n--- Where do bed bugs come from?\nBed bugs don\u2019t fly or jump or come in from the garden. They crawl very quickly and hide in travelers\u2019 luggage. They also move around on secondhand furniture, or from apartment to apartment.\n\n--- How can I avoid bringing bed bugs home?\n\u201cIt would probably be a prudent thing to do a quick bed check if you\u2019re sleeping in a strange bed,\u201d said Potter. His recommendation goes for hotel rooms, as well as dorms and summer camp bunk beds. He suggests pulling back the sheet at the head of the bed and checking the seams on the top and bottom of the mattress and the box spring. \n\n---+ For more tips, read the entire article on KQED Science:\nhttps://www.kqed.org/science/1944245/watch-bed-bugs-get-stopped-in-their-tracks\n\n---+ More Great Deep Look Episodes:\n\u2018Parasites are Dynamite\u2019 Playlist: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLdKlciEDdCQACmrtvWX7hr7X7Zv8F4nEi\n\n---+  \ud83c\udfc6Congratulations \ud83c\udfc6to the following fans for correctly identifying the creature's species name in our community tab challenge: \n\nStay in Your Layne\nBrian Lee\nBrad Denney\nElise Wade\nRaminta\u2019s Photography\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UC-3SbfTPJsL8fJAPKiVqBLg/community?lb=Ugz37Tnkfr8gOF7tRL54AaABCQ\n\n---+ Thank you to our Top Patreon Supporters ($10+ per month)!\n\nAllen, Aurora Mitchell, Beckie, Ben Espey, Bill Cass, Bluapex, Breanna Tarnawsky, Carl, Chris B Emrick, Chris Murphy, Cindy McGill, Companion Cube, Cory, Daisuke Goto, Daisy Trevino , Daniel Voisine, Daniel Weinstein, David Deshpande, Dean Skoglund, Edwin Rivas, Elizabeth Ann Ditz, Eric Carter, Geidi Rodriguez, Gerardo Alfaro, Ivan Alexander, Jane Orbuch, JanetFromAnotherPlanet, Jason Buberel, Jeanine Womble, Jeanne Sommer, Jiayang Li, Joao Ascensao, johanna reis, Johnnyonnyful, Joshua Murallon Robertson, Justin Bull, Kallie Moore, Karen Reynolds, Katherine Schick, Kendall Rasmussen, Kenia Villegas, Kristell Esquivel, KW, Kyle Fisher, Laurel Przybylski, Levi Cai, Mark Joshua Bernardo, Michael Mieczkowski, Michele Wong, Nathan Padilla, Nathan Wright, Nicolette Ray, Pamela Parker, PM Daeley, Ricardo Martinez, riceeater, Richard Shalumov, Rick Wong, Robert Amling, Robert Warner, Samuel Bean, Sayantan Dasgupta, Sean Tucker, Shelley Pearson Cranshaw, Shirley Washburn, Sonia Tanlimco, SueEllen McCann, Supernovabetty, Tea Torvinen, TierZoo, Titania Juang, Two Box Fish, WhatzGames, Willy Nursalim, Yvan Mostaza\n\n---+ Follow KQED Science and Deep Look:\nPatreon: https://www.patreon.com/deeplook\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/kqedscience/\nTwitter: https://www.twitter.com/kqedscience\nKQED Science on kqed.org: http://www.kqed.org/science\nFacebook Watch: https://www.facebook.com/DeepLookPBS/\n\n---+ About KQED\nKQED, an NPR and PBS affiliate in San Francisco, CA, serves Northern California and beyond with a public-supported alternative to commercial TV, radio and web media.\n\nFunding for Deep Look is provided in part by PBS Digital Studios.

                "description": "Honey bees make honey from nectar to fuel their flight \u2013 and our sweet tooth. But they also need pollen for protein. So they trap, brush and pack it into baskets on their legs to make a special food called bee bread. \n\nJOIN our Deep Look community on Patreon! https://www.patreon.com/deeplook \nSUBSCRIBE to Deep Look! http://goo.gl/8NwXqt\n\nDEEP LOOK is a ultra-HD (4K) short video series created by KQED San Francisco and presented by PBS Digital Studios. See the unseen at the very edge of our visible world. Explore big scientific mysteries by going incredibly small.\n\nSpring means honey bees flitting from flower to flower. This frantic insect activity is essential to growing foods like almonds, raspberries and apples. Bees move pollen, making it possible for plants to grow the fruit and seeds they need to reproduce.    \n \nBut honey bees don\u2019t just move pollen from plant to plant. They also keep a lot for themselves. They carry it around in neat little balls, one on each of their hind legs. Collecting, packing and making pollen into something they can eat is a tough, intricate job that\u2019s essential to the colony\u2019s well-being.\n\nOlder female adult bees collect pollen and mix it with nectar or honey as they go along, then carry it back to the hive and deposit it in cells next to the developing baby bees, called larvae. This stored pollen, known as bee bread, is the colony\u2019s main source of protein.  \n \n\u201cYou don\u2019t have bees flying along snacking on pollen as they\u2019re collecting it,\u201d said Mark Carroll, an entomologist at the US Department of Agriculture\u2019s Carl Hayden Bee Research Center in Tucson. \u201cThis is the form of pollen that bees are eating.\u201d \n \n--- What is bee bread? \nIt\u2019s the pollen that worker honey bees have collected, mixed with a little nectar or honey and stored within cells in the hive.  \n \n--- What is bee bread used for? \nBee bread is the main source of protein for adult bees and larvae. Young adult bees eat bee bread to make a liquid food similar to mammal\u2019s milk that they feed to growing larvae; they also feed little bits of bee bread to older larvae.\n\n--- How do honey bees use their pollen basket? \nWhen a bee lands on a flower, it nibbles and licks off the pollen, which sticks to its head. It wipes the pollen off its eyes and antennae with a brush on each of its front legs, using them in tandem like windshield wipers. It also cleans the pollen off its mouth part, and as it does this, it mixes it with some saliva and a little nectar or honey that it carries around in a kind of stomach called a crop.  \nThen the bee uses brushes on its front, middle and hind legs to move the pollen, conveyor-belt style, front to middle to back. As it flies from bloom to bloom, the bee combs the pollen very quickly and moves it into baskets on its hind legs. Each pollen basket, called a corbicula, is a concave section of the hind leg covered by longish hairs that bend over and around the pollen.\n\n---+ Read the entire article on KQED Science:\nhttps://www.kqed.org/science/1940898/honey-bees-make-honey-and-bread \n\n---+ Shoutout!\n \ud83c\udfc6Congratulations \ud83c\udfc6to spqr0a, A D2, James Peirce, Armageddonchampion, and \u0414\u0430\u043d\u0438\u0438\u043b \u041c\u0435\u0440\u0437\u043b\u0438\u043a\u0438\u043d for identifying what our worker bee was putting in a honeycomb cell (and why) - Bee Bread!

                    "description": "Honey bees make honey from nectar to fuel their flight \u2013 and our sweet tooth. But they also need pollen for protein. So they trap, brush and pack it into baskets on their legs to make a special food called bee bread. \n\nJOIN our Deep Look community on Patreon! https://www.patreon.com/deeplook \nSUBSCRIBE to Deep Look! http://goo.gl/8NwXqt\n\nDEEP LOOK is a ultra-HD (4K) short video series created by KQED San Francisco and presented by PBS Digital Studios. See the unseen at the very edge of our visible world. Explore big scientific mysteries by going incredibly small.\n\nSpring means honey bees flitting from flower to flower. This frantic insect activity is essential to growing foods like almonds, raspberries and apples. Bees move pollen, making it possible for plants to grow the fruit and seeds they need to reproduce.    \n \nBut honey bees don\u2019t just move pollen from plant to plant. They also keep a lot for themselves. They carry it around in neat little balls, one on each of their hind legs. Collecting, packing and making pollen into something they can eat is a tough, intricate job that\u2019s essential to the colony\u2019s well-being.\n\nOlder female adult bees collect pollen and mix it with nectar or honey as they go along, then carry it back to the hive and deposit it in cells next to the developing baby bees, called larvae. This stored pollen, known as bee bread, is the colony\u2019s main source of protein.  \n \n\u201cYou don\u2019t have bees flying along snacking on pollen as they\u2019re collecting it,\u201d said Mark Carroll, an entomologist at the US Department of Agriculture\u2019s Carl Hayden Bee Research Center in Tucson. \u201cThis is the form of pollen that bees are eating.\u201d \n \n--- What is bee bread? \nIt\u2019s the pollen that worker honey bees have collected, mixed with a little nectar or honey and stored within cells in the hive.  \n \n--- What is bee bread used for? \nBee bread is the main source of protein for adult bees and larvae. Young adult bees eat bee bread to make a liquid food similar to mammal\u2019s milk that they feed to growing larvae; they also feed little bits of bee bread to older larvae.\n\n--- How do honey bees use their pollen basket? \nWhen a bee lands on a flower, it nibbles and licks off the pollen, which sticks to its head. It wipes the pollen off its eyes and antennae with a brush on each of its front legs, using them in tandem like windshield wipers. It also cleans the pollen off its mouth part, and as it does this, it mixes it with some saliva and a little nectar or honey that it carries around in a kind of stomach called a crop.  \nThen the bee uses brushes on its front, middle and hind legs to move the pollen, conveyor-belt style, front to middle to back. As it flies from bloom to bloom, the bee combs the pollen very quickly and moves it into baskets on its hind legs. Each pollen basket, called a corbicula, is a concave section of the hind leg covered by longish hairs that bend over and around the pollen.\n\n---+ Read the entire article on KQED Science:\nhttps://www.kqed.org/science/1940898/honey-bees-make-honey-and-bread \n\n---+ Shoutout!\n \ud83c\udfc6Congratulations \ud83c\udfc6to spqr0a, A D2, James Peirce, Armageddonchampion, and \u0414\u0430\u043d\u0438\u0438\u043b \u041c\u0435\u0440\u0437\u043b\u0438\u043a\u0438\u043d for identifying what our worker bee was putting in a honeycomb cell (and why) - Bee Bread!

But they have a secret weapon \u2013 toxic chemicals they shoot from special glands. One Bay Area species, Xystocheir dissecta, carries deadly cyanide and benzaldehyde.\n\nIf they\u2019re feeling threatened, these millipedes produce an invisible, odorless hydrogen cyanide gas that they spray at predators, and which is virtually toxic to all organisms. One byproduct is benzaldehyde, which gives off the scent of bitter almonds, as an additional signal that they\u2019re secreting poison.\n\nThe millipedes don\u2019t poison themselves, however. They\u2019ve developed an immunity.\n\nThe cyanide can kill nearly any other animal trying to dine on the millipedes.

It's the largest order of millipedes with about 3500 species. \n\n---+ Read the entire article on KQED Science:\n\nhttps://www.kqed.org/science/1939811/this-millipede-and-beetle-have-a-toxic-relationship\n\n---+ For more information:\n\nKip Will at UC Berkeley: https://ourenvironment.berkeley.edu/people/kipling-will\nScience on the SPOT: Glowing Millipedes of Alcatraz: https://ww2.kqed.org/quest/2013/03/19/science-on-the-spot-the-glowing-millipedes-of-alcatraz/\n\n---+ Shoutout!\n\n\ud83c\udfc6Congratulations \ud83c\udfc6to these fans for suggesting our *5 favorite common names*  for Xystocheir dissecta, on our Community Tab: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC-3SbfTPJsL8fJAPKiVqBLg/community?lb=Ugwt2DsvG4dbBa5HPSF4AaABCQ\n\n#5 Unom Auhasard: Walking rave stick\ufeff\n#4 F E: \"Lumilipede\"\n#3 Mr.salty: \" hell no\ufeff\"\n#2 Mystery Bomb Noel: \"blue galaxy\" \n#1 Tinkili: \"Glowy Feets McGee\"\n\n---+ Thank you to our Top Patreon Supporters ($10+ per month)!\n\nBill Cass, Justin Bull, Daniel Weinstein, Chris B Emrick, Karen Reynolds, Jeremy Lambert, David Deshpande, Daisuke Goto, Bugeyed.fr, WhatzGames, Elizabeth Ann Ditz, Robert Warner, Shirley Washburn, Tatianna Bartlett, KW, Tanya Finch, Elizabeth Wolden, Sayantan Dasgupta, Monica Albe, Willy Nursalim, Jenn's Bowtique, Jane Orbuch, Laurel Przybylski, Johnnyonnyful, Levi Cai, Jason Buberel, Mark Joshua Bernardo, Michael Mieczkowski, Jeanine Womble, Aurora Mitchell, Edwin Rivas, Marjorie D Miller, Companion Cube, Chris Murphy, Joao Ascensao, Two Box Fish, PM Daeley, TierZoo, Robert Amling, Shelley Pearson Cranshaw, Mario Rahmani \n\n---+ About KQED\n\nKQED, an NPR and PBS affiliate in San Francisco, CA, serves Northern California and beyond with a public-supported alternative to commercial TV, Radio and web media.\n\nFunding for Deep Look is provided in part by PBS Digital Studios.

                "description": "Why are itchy lice so tough to get rid of and how do they spread like wildfire? They have huge claws that hook on hair perfectly, as they crawl quickly from head to head.\n\nJOIN our Deep Look community on Patreon! https://www.patreon.com/deeplook\n\nSUBSCRIBE to Deep Look! http://goo.gl/8NwXqt \n\nDEEP LOOK is an ultra-HD (4K) short video series created by KQED San Francisco and presented by PBS Digital Studios. See the unseen at the very edge of our visible world. Explore big scientific mysteries by going incredibly small. \n\nHead lice can only move by crawling on hair. They glue their eggs to individual strands, nice and close to the scalp, where the heat helps them hatch. They feed on blood several times a day. And even though head lice can spread by laying their eggs in sports helmets and baseball caps, the main way they get around is by simply crawling from one head to another using scythe-shaped claws.  \n\nThese claws, which are big relative to a louse\u2019s body, work in unison with a small spiky thumb-like part called a spine. With the claw and spine at the end of each of its six legs, a louse grasps a hair strand to hold on, or quickly crawl from hair to hair like a speedy acrobat.\n\nTheir drive to stay on a human head is strong because once they\u2019re off and lose access to their blood meals, they starve and die within 15 to 24 hours.\n\n--- How do you kill lice?\nResearchers found in 2016 that lice in the U.S. have become resistant to over-the-counter insecticide shampoos, which contain natural insecticides called pyrethrins, and their synthetic version, known as pyrethroids.  \n\nOther products do still work against lice, though. Prescription treatments that contain the insecticides ivermectin and spinosad are effective, said entomologist John Clark, of the University of Massachusetts, Amherst. They\u2019re prescribed to kill both lice and their eggs. Clark said treatments such as suffocants, which block the lice\u2019s breathing holes, and hot-air devices that dry them up, also work. He added that tea tree oil works both as a repellent and a \u201cpretty good\u201d insecticide. Combing lice and eggs out with a special metal comb is also a recommended treatment.\n\n--- How long do lice survive?\nIt takes six to nine days for their eggs to hatch and about as long for the young lice to grow up and start laying their own eggs. Adult lice can live on a person\u2019s head for up to 30 days, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).\n\n--- Can your pet give you lice?\nNo. Human head lice only live on our heads. They can\u2019t really move to other parts of our body or onto pets.\n\n---+ Read the entire article on KQED Science:\nhttps://www.kqed.org/science/1939435/how-lice-turn-your-hair-into-their-jungle-gym\n\n---+ For more information:\nVisit the CDC\u2019s page on head lice: https://www.cdc.gov/parasites/lice/head/index.html\n\n---+ More Great Deep Look episodes:\n\nHow Mosquitoes Use Six Needles to Suck Your Blood:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rD8SmacBUcU\n\nHow Ticks Dig In With a Mouth Full of Hooks:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_IoOJu2_FKE \n\n---+ Shoutout!\n\nCongratulations to \ud83c\udfc6HaileyBubs, Tiffany Haner, cjovani78z,  \u05d9\u05d5\u05d0\u05d1\u05d9 \u05d0\u05d9\u05d9\u05dc, and Bellybutton King\ud83c\udfc6, who were the first to correctly ID the species and subspecies of insect in this episode over at the Deep Look Community Tab:\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UC-3SbfTPJsL8fJAPKiVqBLg/community?lb=Ugwl_PstCaUYdfgvfa54AaABCQ\n\n\n---+ Thank you to our Top Patreon Supporters ($10+ per month)!\n \nBill Cass, Justin Bull, Daniel Weinstein, David Deshpande, Daisuke Goto, Karen Reynolds, Yidan Sun, Elizabeth Ann Ditz, KW, Shirley Washburn, Tanya Finch, johanna reis, Shelley Pearson Cranshaw, Johnnyonnyful, Levi Cai, Jeanine Womble, Michael Mieczkowski, TierZoo, James Tarraga, Willy Nursalim, Aurora Mitchell, Marjorie D Miller, Joao Ascensao, PM Daeley, Two Box Fish, Tatianna Bartlett, Monica Albe, Jason Buberel\n\n---+ Follow KQED Science and Deep Look:\n\nPatreon: https://www.patreon.com/deeplook\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/kqedscience/\nTwitter: https://www.twitter.com/kqedscience\nKQED Science on kqed.org: http://www.kqed.org/science\nFacebook Watch: https://www.facebook.com/DeepLookPBS/\n\n---+ About KQED\n\nKQED, an NPR and PBS affiliate in San Francisco, CA, serves Northern California and beyond with a public-supported alternative to commercial TV, Radio and web media.\n\nFunding for Deep Look is provided in part by PBS Digital Studios.

They have huge claws that hook on hair perfectly, as they crawl quickly from head to head.\n\nJOIN our Deep Look community on Patreon! https://www.patreon.com/deeplook\n\nSUBSCRIBE to Deep Look! http://goo.gl/8NwXqt \n\nDEEP LOOK is an ultra-HD (4K) short video series created by KQED San Francisco and presented by PBS Digital Studios. See the unseen at the very edge of our visible world. Explore big scientific mysteries by going incredibly small. \n\nHead lice can only move by crawling on hair. They glue their eggs to individual strands, nice and close to the scalp, where the heat helps them hatch. They feed on blood several times a day. And even though head lice can spread by laying their eggs in sports helmets and baseball caps, the main way they get around is by simply crawling from one head to another using scythe-shaped claws.  \n\nThese claws, which are big relative to a louse\u2019s body, work in unison with a small spiky thumb-like part called a spine. With the claw and spine at the end of each of its six legs, a louse grasps a hair strand to hold on, or quickly crawl from hair to hair like a speedy acrobat.\n\nTheir drive to stay on a human head is strong because once they\u2019re off and lose access to their blood meals, they starve and die within 15 to 24 hours.\n\n--- How do you kill lice?\nResearchers found in 2016 that lice in the U.S. have become resistant to over-the-counter insecticide shampoos, which contain natural insecticides called pyrethrins, and their synthetic version, known as pyrethroids.  \n\nOther products do still work against lice, though. Prescription treatments that contain the insecticides ivermectin and spinosad are effective, said entomologist John Clark, of the University of Massachusetts, Amherst. They\u2019re prescribed to kill both lice and their eggs. Clark said treatments such as suffocants, which block the lice\u2019s breathing holes, and hot-air devices that dry them up, also work. He added that tea tree oil works both as a repellent and a \u201cpretty good\u201d insecticide. Combing lice and eggs out with a special metal comb is also a recommended treatment.\n\n--- How long do lice survive?\nIt takes six to nine days for their eggs to hatch and about as long for the young lice to grow up and start laying their own eggs. Adult lice can live on a person\u2019s head for up to 30 days, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).\n\n--- Can your pet give you lice?\nNo. Human head lice only live on our heads.

With a speckled exterior and a shield-like shape, the brown marmorated stink bug doesn\u2019t appear to be any different from any other six-legged insect that might pop up in your garden.

Not only can it invade homes by the thousands in the wintertime, it\u2019s one formidable agricultural pest, eating millions of dollars of peaches, apples and other crops since 2010.\n\nScientists are now investigating a new tactic in the war on the stink bugs: the possibility of relying on one of the bug\u2019s natural enemies, the samurai wasp.\n\nAlso native to Asia, this parasitic wasp keeps the stink bug population in check there.

With a speckled exterior and a shield-like shape, the brown marmorated stink bug doesn\u2019t appear to be any different from any other six-legged insect that might pop up in your garden. But this particular bug, which arrived in the U.S. from Asia in the mid-1990s and smells like old socks when it is squashed, is a real nuisance. Not only can it invade homes by the thousands in the wintertime, it\u2019s one formidable agricultural pest, eating millions of dollars of peaches, apples and other crops since 2010.\n\nScientists are now investigating a new tactic in the war on the stink bugs: the possibility of relying on one of the bug\u2019s natural enemies, the samurai wasp.\n\nAlso native to Asia, this parasitic wasp keeps the stink bug population in check there.

See the unseen at the very edge of our visible world. Explore big scientific mysteries by going incredibly small.\n\n--- How much more powerful is a dog\u2019s sense of smell compared to a human?\nAccording to one estimate, dogs are 10,000-100,000 times more sensitive to smell than humans. They have about 15 times more olfactory neurons that send signals about odors to the brain. The neurons in a dog\u2019s nose are spread out over a much larger and more convoluted area allowing them more easily decipher specific chemicals in the air.\n\n--- Why are dog noses wet?\nDog noses secrete mucus which traps odors in the air and on the ground. When a dog licks its nose, the tongue brings those odors into the mouth allowing it to sample those smells. Dogs mostly cool themselves by panting but the mucus on their noses and sweat from their paws cool through evaporation.\n\n--- Why do dog nostrils have slits on the side?\nDogs sniff about five times per second. The slits on the sides allows exhaled air to vent towards the sides and back. That air moving towards the back of the dog creates a low air pressure region in front of it. Air from in front of the dog rushes in to fill that low pressure region. That allows the nose to actively bring odors in from in front and keeps the exhaled air from contaminating new samples.\n\n---+ Read the entire article on KQED Science:\n\nhttps://ww2.kqed.org/science/2019/02/26/how-your-dogs-nose-knows-so-much/\n\n---+ For more information:\n\nThe Odor Navigation Project funded NSF Brain Initiative\nhttps://odornavigation.org/\n\nJacobs Lab of Cognitive Biology at UC Berkeley\nhttp://jacobs.berkeley.edu/\n\nEcological Fluid Dynamics Lab at University of Colorado Boulder\nhttps://www.colorado.edu/lab/ecological-fluids/\n\nThe fluid dynamics of canine olfaction: unique nasal airflow patterns as an explanation of macrosmia (Brent A.

                "description": "Support Deep Look on Patreon! https://www.patreon.com/deeplook\n\nA baby hairworm hitches a ride inside a cricket, feasting on its fat until the coiled-up parasite is ready to burst out. Then it hijacks the cricket's mind and compels it to head to water for a gruesome little swim.\n\nSUBSCRIBE to Deep Look! http://goo.gl/8NwXqt\n\nDEEP LOOK is an ultra-HD (4K) short video series created by KQED San Francisco and presented by PBS Digital Studios. See the unseen at the very edge of our visible world. Explore big scientific mysteries by going incredibly small.\n\nIf you\u2019re out on a hike and look down at a puddle, you might spot a long, brown spaghetti-shaped creature whipping around madly in a figure 8. \n\nIt\u2019s a hairworm \u2013 also known as a horsehair worm or Gordian worm \u2013 and researchers have described 350 species around the world. Good news: It isn\u2019t interested in infecting or attacking humans. But if you had happened on the puddle a few hours earlier, you might have witnessed a gruesome spectacle \u2013 the hairworm wriggling out of a cricket\u2019s body, pushing its way out like the baby monster in the movie \u201cAlien.\u201d\n\nHow a hairworm ends up in a puddle, or another water source such as a stream, hot tub or a pet\u2019s water dish, is a complex story. A young hairworm finds its way into a cricket or similar insect like a beetle or grasshopper, and once it\u2019s grown into an adult, the parasite takes over its host\u2019s brain to hitch a ride to the water. \n\nAs a result of the infection, crickets stop growing and reproducing. Male crickets infected by hairworms even lose their chirp, said Ben Hanelt, a biologist at the University of New Mexico who studies hairworms.\n\n--- What *is* a hair worm?\nA hair worm or hairworm \u2013 pick your spelling \u2013 is a nematomorph. Nematomorpha are a group of parasites. They\u2019re long, thin worms that can grow to be several meters long inside their host.\n\n--- Can humans be infected by hair worms?\nThere are reports of humans and cats and dogs being infected by hair worms, but hair worms aren\u2019t after us or our pets because they can\u2019t grow inside us, said Hanelt.

Then it hijacks the cricket's mind and compels it to head to water for a gruesome little swim.\n\nSUBSCRIBE to Deep Look! http://goo.gl/8NwXqt\n\nDEEP LOOK is an ultra-HD (4K) short video series created by KQED San Francisco and presented by PBS Digital Studios. See the unseen at the very edge of our visible world. Explore big scientific mysteries by going incredibly small.\n\nIf you\u2019re out on a hike and look down at a puddle, you might spot a long, brown spaghetti-shaped creature whipping around madly in a figure 8. \n\nIt\u2019s a hairworm \u2013 also known as a horsehair worm or Gordian worm \u2013 and researchers have described 350 species around the world. Good news: It isn\u2019t interested in infecting or attacking humans. But if you had happened on the puddle a few hours earlier, you might have witnessed a gruesome spectacle \u2013 the hairworm wriggling out of a cricket\u2019s body, pushing its way out like the baby monster in the movie \u201cAlien.\u201d\n\nHow a hairworm ends up in a puddle, or another water source such as a stream, hot tub or a pet\u2019s water dish, is a complex story. A young hairworm finds its way into a cricket or similar insect like a beetle or grasshopper, and once it\u2019s grown into an adult, the parasite takes over its host\u2019s brain to hitch a ride to the water. \n\nAs a result of the infection, crickets stop growing and reproducing. Male crickets infected by hairworms even lose their chirp, said Ben Hanelt, a biologist at the University of New Mexico who studies hairworms.\n\n--- What *is* a hair worm?\nA hair worm or hairworm \u2013 pick your spelling \u2013 is a nematomorph. Nematomorpha are a group of parasites. They\u2019re long, thin worms that can grow to be several meters long inside their host.\n\n--- Can humans be infected by hair worms?\nThere are reports of humans and cats and dogs being infected by hair worms, but hair worms aren\u2019t after us or our pets because they can\u2019t grow inside us, said Hanelt. They can only grow inside a host like a cricket or a related insect.\n\n\u201cWhat happens is that a dog, a cat, a human will ingest an adult (hair worm) somehow,\u201d said Hanelt. \u201cCould a cricket crawl in your sandwich before you take a bite? I don\u2019t know. None of the studies that are out there talk about that. What they have been reported to do is to cause in many people intestinal distress.\u201d   \n\n--- How do hair worms control crickets\u2019 minds? \nScientists don\u2019t understand the precise mechanism yet, but they believe that hairworms either boost chemicals in the crickets\u2019 brains or pump chemicals into their brains. \n\n---+ Read the entire article on KQED Science:\nhttps://www.kqed.org/science/1937775/these-hairworms-eat-a-cricket-alive-and-control-its-mind\n\n---+ For more information:\n\nHairworm Biodiversity Survey: http://www.nematomorpha.net\n\n---+ More great Deep Look episodes:\n\nJerusalem Crickets Only Date Drummers\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHbwC-AIyTE\n\nHow Mosquitoes Use Six Needles to Suck Your Blood\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rD8SmacBUcU\n\nIdentical Snowflakes?

They use their bulbous bellies to serenade each other with some furious drumming. \n\nSupport Deep Look on Patreon! https://www.patreon.com/deeplook\nCome join us on our Deep Look Communty Tab: https://www.youtube.com/user/KQEDDeepLook/community\n\n--\n\nDEEP LOOK is an ultra-HD (4K) short video series created by KQED San Francisco and presented by PBS Digital Studios. See the unseen at the very edge of our visible world. Explore big scientific mysteries by going incredibly small. \n\nPotato Bug. Child of the Earth. Old Bald-Headed Man. Skull Insects. Devil\u2019s Baby. Spawn of Satan. There\u2019s a fairly long list of imaginative nicknames that refer to Jerusalem crickets, those six-legged insects with eerily humanlike faces and prominent striped abdomens. And they can get quite large, too: Some measure over 3 inches long and weigh more than a mouse, so they can be quite unnerving if you see them crawling around in your backyard in summertime.\n\nOne individual who finds them compelling, and not creepy, has been studying Jerusalem crickets for over 40 years: David Weissman, a research associate in entomology affiliated with the California Academy of Sciences in San Francisco. He\u2019s now considered the world\u2019s foremost expert, since no one else has been as captivated or singlemindedly devoted to learning more about them.\n\nWhile much of their general behavior is still not widely understood, Jerusalem crickets typically live solitary lives underground. They\u2019ll emerge at night to scavenge for roots, tubers and smaller insects for their meals. And it\u2019s also when they come out to serenade potential partners with a musical ritual: To attract a mate, adult crickets use their abdomens to drum the ground and generate low-frequency sound waves.\n\nIf a male begins drumming and a female senses the vibrations, she\u2019ll respond with a longer drumming sequence so that he\u2019ll have enough time to track her down. The drumming can vary between one beat every other second up to 40 beats per second.\n\n---+ Read the entire article on KQED Science: \nhttps://www.kqed.org/science/1932923/jerusalem-crickets-only-date-drummers\n\n---+ For more information: \n\nJERUSALEM!

They use their bulbous bellies to serenade each other with some furious drumming. \n\nSupport Deep Look on Patreon! https://www.patreon.com/deeplook\nCome join us on our Deep Look Communty Tab: https://www.youtube.com/user/KQEDDeepLook/community\n\n--\n\nDEEP LOOK is an ultra-HD (4K) short video series created by KQED San Francisco and presented by PBS Digital Studios. See the unseen at the very edge of our visible world. Explore big scientific mysteries by going incredibly small. \n\nPotato Bug. Child of the Earth. Old Bald-Headed Man. Skull Insects. Devil\u2019s Baby. Spawn of Satan. There\u2019s a fairly long list of imaginative nicknames that refer to Jerusalem crickets, those six-legged insects with eerily humanlike faces and prominent striped abdomens. And they can get quite large, too: Some measure over 3 inches long and weigh more than a mouse, so they can be quite unnerving if you see them crawling around in your backyard in summertime.\n\nOne individual who finds them compelling, and not creepy, has been studying Jerusalem crickets for over 40 years: David Weissman, a research associate in entomology affiliated with the California Academy of Sciences in San Francisco. He\u2019s now considered the world\u2019s foremost expert, since no one else has been as captivated or singlemindedly devoted to learning more about them.\n\nWhile much of their general behavior is still not widely understood, Jerusalem crickets typically live solitary lives underground. They\u2019ll emerge at night to scavenge for roots, tubers and smaller insects for their meals. And it\u2019s also when they come out to serenade potential partners with a musical ritual: To attract a mate, adult crickets use their abdomens to drum the ground and generate low-frequency sound waves.\n\nIf a male begins drumming and a female senses the vibrations, she\u2019ll respond with a longer drumming sequence so that he\u2019ll have enough time to track her down. The drumming can vary between one beat every other second up to 40 beats per second.\n\n---+ Read the entire article on KQED Science: \nhttps://www.kqed.org/science/1932923/jerusalem-crickets-only-date-drummers\n\n---+ For more information: \n\nJERUSALEM!

                "description": "It's an all-out brawl for prime beach real estate! These Caribbean crabs will tear each other limb from limb to get the best burrow. Luckily, they molt and regrow lost legs in a matter of weeks, and live to fight another day.\n\nYou can learn more about CuriosityStream at https://curiositystream.com/deeplook\nHelp Deep Look grow by supporting us on Patreon!! \nhttps://www.patreon.com/deeplook\n\nPBS Digital Studios Mega-playlist:\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL1mtdjDVOoOqKjV9WNrIXRphDssM4gu0J\n\nDEEP LOOK is a ultra-HD (4K) short video series created by KQED San Francisco and presented by PBS Digital Studios. See the unseen at the very edge of our visible world. Explore big scientific mysteries by going incredibly small.\n\nOn the sand-dune beaches where they live, male blackback land crabs do constant battle over territory. The stakes are high: If one of these baby-faced crabs secures a winning spot, he can invite a mate into his den, six or seven feet beneath the surface.\n\nWith all this roughhousing, more than feelings get hurt. The male crabs inevitably lose limbs and damage their shells in constant dust-ups. Luckily, like many other arthropods, a group that includes insects and spiders, these crabs can release a leg or claw voluntarily if threatened. It\u2019s not unusual to see animals in the field missing two or three walking legs. \n\nThe limbs regrow at the next molt, which is typically once a year for an adult. When a molt cycle begins, tiny limb buds form where a leg or a claw has been lost. Over the next six to eight weeks, the buds enlarge while the crab reabsorbs calcium from its old shell and secretes a new, paper-thin one underneath. \n\nIn the last hour of the cycle, the crab gulps air to create enough internal pressure to pop open the top of its shell, called the carapace. As the crab pushes it way out, the same internal pressure helps uncoil the new legs. The replacement shell thickens and hardens, and the crab eats the old shell.\n\n--- Are blackback land crabs edible?\n\nYes, but they\u2019re not as popular as the major food species like Dungeness and King crab.\n\n--- Where do blackback land crabs live?\n\nThey live throughout the Caribbean islands. \n\n--- Does it hurt when they lose legs?\n\nHard to say, but they do have an internal mechanism for releasing limbs cleanly that prevents loss of blood.\n\n---+ Read the entire article on KQED Science:\n\nhttps://www.kqed.org/science/1933532/whack-jab-crack-its-a-blackback-land-crab-smackdown\n\n---+ For more information:\n\nThe Crab Lab at Colorado State University:\nhttps://rydberg.biology.colostate.edu/mykleslab/\n\n---+ More Great Deep Look episodes:\n\nWant a Whole New Body?

Luckily, they molt and regrow lost legs in a matter of weeks, and live to fight another day.\n\nYou can learn more about CuriosityStream at https://curiositystream.com/deeplook\nHelp Deep Look grow by supporting us on Patreon!! \nhttps://www.patreon.com/deeplook\n\nPBS Digital Studios Mega-playlist:\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL1mtdjDVOoOqKjV9WNrIXRphDssM4gu0J\n\nDEEP LOOK is a ultra-HD (4K) short video series created by KQED San Francisco and presented by PBS Digital Studios. See the unseen at the very edge of our visible world. Explore big scientific mysteries by going incredibly small.\n\nOn the sand-dune beaches where they live, male blackback land crabs do constant battle over territory. The stakes are high: If one of these baby-faced crabs secures a winning spot, he can invite a mate into his den, six or seven feet beneath the surface.\n\nWith all this roughhousing, more than feelings get hurt. The male crabs inevitably lose limbs and damage their shells in constant dust-ups. Luckily, like many other arthropods, a group that includes insects and spiders, these crabs can release a leg or claw voluntarily if threatened. It\u2019s not unusual to see animals in the field missing two or three walking legs. \n\nThe limbs regrow at the next molt, which is typically once a year for an adult. When a molt cycle begins, tiny limb buds form where a leg or a claw has been lost. Over the next six to eight weeks, the buds enlarge while the crab reabsorbs calcium from its old shell and secretes a new, paper-thin one underneath. \n\nIn the last hour of the cycle, the crab gulps air to create enough internal pressure to pop open the top of its shell, called the carapace. As the crab pushes it way out, the same internal pressure helps uncoil the new legs. The replacement shell thickens and hardens, and the crab eats the old shell.\n\n--- Are blackback land crabs edible?\n\nYes, but they\u2019re not as popular as the major food species like Dungeness and King crab.\n\n--- Where do blackback land crabs live?\n\nThey live throughout the Caribbean islands. \n\n--- Does it hurt when they lose legs?\n\nHard to say, but they do have an internal mechanism for releasing limbs cleanly that prevents loss of blood.\n\n---+ Read the entire article on KQED Science:\n\nhttps://www.kqed.org/science/1933532/whack-jab-crack-its-a-blackback-land-crab-smackdown\n\n---+ For more information:\n\nThe Crab Lab at Colorado State University:\nhttps://rydberg.biology.colostate.edu/mykleslab/\n\n---+ More Great Deep Look episodes:\n\nWant a Whole New Body?

                "description": "Planarians are tiny googly-eyed flatworms with an uncanny ability: They can regrow their entire bodies, even a new head. So how do they do it?\n\nYou can learn more about CuriosityStream at https://curiositystream.com/deeplook\nSupport Deep Look on Patreon!! https://www.patreon.com/deeplook\n\nDEEP LOOK is a ultra-HD (4K) short video series created by KQED San Francisco and presented by PBS Digital Studios. Explore big scientific mysteries by going incredibly small.\n\nNelson Hall wants you to know that the googly-eyed flatworm he just sliced into four pieces is going to be OK.\n\nThree of the flatworm\u2019s four pieces have started to wriggle away from each other and its head is moving in circles under Hall\u2019s microscope. \u201cThe head will just go off and do its own thing,\u201d said Hall, a doctoral student of bioengineering at Stanford University.\n \nBut in three weeks, the head, as well as the other pieces, will each have grown into a complete flatworm just like the one Hall sliced up, dark brown and about a half-inch long. \n\nHall and researchers around the world are hard at work trying to understand how these flatworms, called planarians, use powerful stem cells to regenerate their entire bodies, an ability humans can only dream of. \n\nAnimals like starfish, salamanders and crabs can regrow a tail or a leg. Planarians, on the other hand, can regrow their entire bodies \u2013 even their heads, which only a few animals can do.\n\n---What is the difference between healing and regeneration?\nWhen we suffer a severe injury, the best we can hope for is that our wounds will heal. \u201cHealing is more like closing the wound and cleaning debris. It\u2019s too short of a process to have tissue replacement,\u201d said Hall. \u201cRegeneration is replacing the tissue that was lost.\u201d\n\n---What are pluripotent stem cells?\nIf planarians can regrow body parts, why can\u2019t we? Key to planarians\u2019 regenerative ability are powerful cells called pluripotent stem cells, which make up one-fifth of their bodies and can grow into every new body part. Humans only have pluripotent stem cells during the embryonic stage, before birth. After that, we mostly lose our ability to sprout new organs.\n\n\u201cWe have a couple of tissues that can regenerate, like the liver, the outer layers of the skin and the inner layers of the intestine, and the bone marrow,\u201d said Dr. Stephen Badylak, Deputy Director of the McGowan Institute for Regenerative Medicine at the University of Pittsburgh. \u201cBut the way we heal most tissues is by forming scar tissue.\u201d\n\nScientists hope that studying planarians could lead to treatments for humans in which our stem cells could be coaxed one day to regrow severed limbs or sick organs. \n\n---How to grow a fingertip.\nDoctors are limited in what they can currently do to help people who lose a limb or part of one. Badylak, who doesn\u2019t study planarians, has developed a treatment at the University of Pittsburgh that helps patients regrow their fingertips after an accident.\n\nHe applies a powder made of animal collagen and substances that stimulate cells to grow, to help form a scaffold that attracts stem cells from the parts of the nail that weren\u2019t cut off. The stem cells regrow the fingertip, which isn\u2019t identical to the one that was cut off, but is functional.\n\n---+ Read the entire article on KQED Science:\nhttps://www.kqed.org/science/1933246/want-a-whole-new-body-ask-this-flatworm-how\n\n---+ For more information:\nRegeneration in Nature: Francesc Cebri\u00e0\u2019s blog on animal regeneration: https://regenerationinnature.wordpress.com\n\n---+ More great Deep Look episodes:\n\nDaddy Longlegs Risk Life ... and Especially Limb ... to Survive\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tjDmH8zhp6o\n\nTake Two Leeches and Call Me in the Morning\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-0SFWPLaII\n\nThese Fighting Fruit Flies Are Superheroes of Brain Science\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yvd3X1N0jUU\n\n---+ See some great videos and documentaries from PBS Digital Studios!\n\nReactions: Why Tardigrades are Some of the Most Hardcore Critters on the Planet\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dEW1_Pba3z4\n\nIt\u2019s Okay to Be Smart: Is Height All In Our Genes?\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0cuO5OSDMbw\n\n---+ Follow KQED Science:\n\nKQED Science: http://www.kqed.org/science\nTumblr: http://kqedscience.tumblr.com\nTwitter: https://www.twitter.com/kqedscience\n\n---+ About KQED\n\nKQED, an NPR and PBS affiliate in San Francisco, CA, serves Northern California and beyond with a public-supported alternative to commercial TV, radio and web media.\n\nFunding for Deep Look is provided in part by PBS Digital Studios.

Explore big scientific mysteries by going incredibly small.\n\nNelson Hall wants you to know that the googly-eyed flatworm he just sliced into four pieces is going to be OK.\n\nThree of the flatworm\u2019s four pieces have started to wriggle away from each other and its head is moving in circles under Hall\u2019s microscope. \u201cThe head will just go off and do its own thing,\u201d said Hall, a doctoral student of bioengineering at Stanford University.\n \nBut in three weeks, the head, as well as the other pieces, will each have grown into a complete flatworm just like the one Hall sliced up, dark brown and about a half-inch long. \n\nHall and researchers around the world are hard at work trying to understand how these flatworms, called planarians, use powerful stem cells to regenerate their entire bodies, an ability humans can only dream of. \n\nAnimals like starfish, salamanders and crabs can regrow a tail or a leg. Planarians, on the other hand, can regrow their entire bodies \u2013 even their heads, which only a few animals can do.\n\n---What is the difference between healing and regeneration?\nWhen we suffer a severe injury, the best we can hope for is that our wounds will heal. \u201cHealing is more like closing the wound and cleaning debris. It\u2019s too short of a process to have tissue replacement,\u201d said Hall. \u201cRegeneration is replacing the tissue that was lost.\u201d\n\n---What are pluripotent stem cells?\nIf planarians can regrow body parts, why can\u2019t we? Key to planarians\u2019 regenerative ability are powerful cells called pluripotent stem cells, which make up one-fifth of their bodies and can grow into every new body part. Humans only have pluripotent stem cells during the embryonic stage, before birth. After that, we mostly lose our ability to sprout new organs.\n\n\u201cWe have a couple of tissues that can regenerate, like the liver, the outer layers of the skin and the inner layers of the intestine, and the bone marrow,\u201d said Dr. Stephen Badylak, Deputy Director of the McGowan Institute for Regenerative Medicine at the University of Pittsburgh. \u201cBut the way we heal most tissues is by forming scar tissue.\u201d\n\nScientists hope that studying planarians could lead to treatments for humans in which our stem cells could be coaxed one day to regrow severed limbs or sick organs. \n\n---How to grow a fingertip.\nDoctors are limited in what they can currently do to help people who lose a limb or part of one. Badylak, who doesn\u2019t study planarians, has developed a treatment at the University of Pittsburgh that helps patients regrow their fingertips after an accident.\n\nHe applies a powder made of animal collagen and substances that stimulate cells to grow, to help form a scaffold that attracts stem cells from the parts of the nail that weren\u2019t cut off. The stem cells regrow the fingertip, which isn\u2019t identical to the one that was cut off, but is functional.\n\n---+ Read the entire article on KQED Science:\nhttps://www.kqed.org/science/1933246/want-a-whole-new-body-ask-this-flatworm-how\n\n---+ For more information:\nRegeneration in Nature: Francesc Cebri\u00e0\u2019s blog on animal regeneration: https://regenerationinnature.wordpress.com\n\n---+ More great Deep Look episodes:\n\nDaddy Longlegs Risk Life ... and Especially Limb ... to Survive\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tjDmH8zhp6o\n\nTake Two Leeches and Call Me in the Morning\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-0SFWPLaII\n\nThese Fighting Fruit Flies Are Superheroes of Brain Science\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yvd3X1N0jUU\n\n---+ See some great videos and documentaries from PBS Digital Studios!\n\nReactions: Why Tardigrades are Some of the Most Hardcore Critters on the Planet\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dEW1_Pba3z4\n\nIt\u2019s Okay to Be Smart: Is Height All In Our Genes?\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0cuO5OSDMbw\n\n---+ Follow KQED Science:\n\nKQED Science: http://www.kqed.org/science\nTumblr: http://kqedscience.tumblr.com\nTwitter: https://www.twitter.com/kqedscience\n\n---+ About KQED\n\nKQED, an NPR and PBS affiliate in San Francisco, CA, serves Northern California and beyond with a public-supported alternative to commercial TV, radio and web media.\n\nFunding for Deep Look is provided in part by PBS Digital Studios.

                "description": "Please follow us on Patreon! https://www.patreon.com/deeplook\nTake the PBSDS survey: https://to.pbs.org/2018YTSurvey \n\nCORRECTION, 9/26/2018: This episode of Deep Look contains an error in the scientific name of the house centipede. It is Scutigera coleoptrata, not coleoptera. We regret the error. The viewers who caught the mistake will receive a free Deep Look T-shirt, and our gratitude. Thanks for keeping tabs on us!\n\nVoracious, venomous and hella leggy, house centipedes are masterful predators with a knack for fancy footwork. But not all their legs are made for walking, they put some to work in other surprising ways. \n\nSUBSCRIBE to Deep Look! http://goo.gl/8NwXqt\n\nRecognizable for their striking (some might say, repulsive) starburst-like shape, house centipedes have far fewer than the 100 legs their name suggests. They\u2019re born with a modest eight, a count that grows to 30 as they reach adulthood. \n\nIf 30 legs sound like more than one critter really needs \u2013 perhaps it is. Over the last 450 million years or so, when centipedes split off from other arthropods, evolution has turned some of those walking limbs into other useful and versatile tools. \n\nWhen it hunts, for example, the house centipede uses its legs as a rope to restrain prey in a tactic called \u201classoing.\u201d The tip of each leg is so finely segmented and flexible that it can coil around its victim to prevent escape.\n\nThe centipede\u2019s venom-injecting fangs, called forciples, are also modified legs. Though shorter and thicker than the walking limbs, they are multi-jointed , which makes them far more  dexterous than the fangs of insects and spiders, which hinge in only one plane. \n\nBecause of this dexterity, the centipede\u2019s forciples not only inject venom, but also hold prey in place while the centipede feeds. Then they take a turn as a grooming tool. The centipede passes its legs through the forciples to clean and lubricate their sensory hairs. \n\nScientists have long noticed that because of their length and the fact that the centipede holds them aloft when it walks, these back legs give the appearance of a second pair antennae. The house centipede looks like it has two heads. \n\nIn evolution, when an animal imitates itself, it\u2019s called automimicry.

It is Scutigera coleoptrata, not coleoptera. We regret the error. The viewers who caught the mistake will receive a free Deep Look T-shirt, and our gratitude. Thanks for keeping tabs on us!\n\nVoracious, venomous and hella leggy, house centipedes are masterful predators with a knack for fancy footwork. But not all their legs are made for walking, they put some to work in other surprising ways. \n\nSUBSCRIBE to Deep Look! http://goo.gl/8NwXqt\n\nRecognizable for their striking (some might say, repulsive) starburst-like shape, house centipedes have far fewer than the 100 legs their name suggests. They\u2019re born with a modest eight, a count that grows to 30 as they reach adulthood. \n\nIf 30 legs sound like more than one critter really needs \u2013 perhaps it is. Over the last 450 million years or so, when centipedes split off from other arthropods, evolution has turned some of those walking limbs into other useful and versatile tools. \n\nWhen it hunts, for example, the house centipede uses its legs as a rope to restrain prey in a tactic called \u201classoing.\u201d The tip of each leg is so finely segmented and flexible that it can coil around its victim to prevent escape.\n\nThe centipede\u2019s venom-injecting fangs, called forciples, are also modified legs. Though shorter and thicker than the walking limbs, they are multi-jointed , which makes them far more  dexterous than the fangs of insects and spiders, which hinge in only one plane. \n\nBecause of this dexterity, the centipede\u2019s forciples not only inject venom, but also hold prey in place while the centipede feeds. Then they take a turn as a grooming tool. The centipede passes its legs through the forciples to clean and lubricate their sensory hairs. \n\nScientists have long noticed that because of their length and the fact that the centipede holds them aloft when it walks, these back legs give the appearance of a second pair antennae. The house centipede looks like it has two heads. \n\nIn evolution, when an animal imitates itself, it\u2019s called automimicry. Automimicry occurs in some fish, birds and butterflies, and usually serves to divert predators. \n\nNew research suggests that\u2019s not the whole story with the house centipede. Electron microscopy conducted on the centipede\u2019s legs has revealed as many sensory hairs, or sensilla, on them as on the antennae.\n\nThe presence of so many sensory hairs suggest the centipede\u2019s long back legs are not merely dummies used in a defensive ploy, but serve a special function, possibly in mate selection. During courtship, both the male and female house centipede slowly raise and lower their antennae and back legs, followed by mutual tapping and probing. \n\n--- Are house centipedes dangerous?\n\nThough they do have venom, house centipedes don\u2019t typically bite humans. \n\n--- Where do house centipedes live?\n\nHouse centipedes live anywhere where the humidity hovers around 90 percent.

Practically deaf and blind, in their first few weeks they need constant warmth and milk to survive. This is a huge challenge for animal shelters, so they're working with researchers on ways to help motherless kittens flourish.\n\nSUBSCRIBE to Deep Look! http://goo.gl/8NwXqt\n\nDEEP LOOK is a ultra-HD (4K) short video series created by KQED San Francisco and presented by PBS Digital Studios.

Explore big scientific mysteries by going incredibly small.\n\n--\n\nEvery year, hundreds of thousands of kittens end up in animal shelters, in need of permanent homes.\n\nBut raising orphaned newborns into healthy, fluffy, frisky two-month-olds ready to be adopted requires an enormous behind-the-scenes effort. All across the country, volunteer foster parents log many sleepless nights bottle-feeding kittens every few hours. So researchers and shelters are trying to figure out ways to make it easier. \n\n\u201cA lot of people think fostering is taking kittens home and playing with them,\u201d said Penny Dougherty, chief executive director of Kitten Central of Placer County, an animal shelter she runs from her house in Newcastle, California, 30 miles northeast of Sacramento.\n\nKitten Central receives most of its kittens from Placer County Animal Services. Dougherty cares for kittens up to one month old, as well as feral and stray cats with litters. Once the kittens weigh at least two pounds and have been spayed and neutered, she returns them to the agency so they can put them up for adoption. \n\n\u201cThey\u2019re very happy to have our services,\u201d said Dougherty, \u201cbecause so many shelters have to euthanize.\u201d \n\nWhen the days start getting longer, around January, cats start breeding. March is the beginning of what\u2019s known among shelters as \u201ckitten season.\u201d The flow of kittens doesn\u2019t slow down until November.\n\n\u201cKitten season is kind of one of the banes of shelter existence,\u201d said Cynthia Delany, supervising shelter veterinarian at Yolo County Animal Services, in Woodland, west of Sacramento. \u201cSix or seven months out of the year we\u2019re just flooded with these little guys.\u201d \n\nTo steer clear of inundating shelters with newborn kittens, Delany\u2019s advice is to leave any litters you might encounter alone unless they\u2019re in immediate danger. Most of the time their mom will return, she said, so check back periodically.\n\nIn an effort to lessen the load on foster parents and increase newborn kittens\u2019 chances of survival, Mikel Maria Delgado, a postdoctoral researcher in the School of Veterinary Medicine at the University of California, Davis, is joining forces with Kitten Central and other animal shelters to figure out if there are optimum temperature and humidity levels that make it possible to feed newborn kittens less frequently. She has distributed incubators to the groups so that two or three kittens can be kept in each one for about three weeks.\n\n---How long do kittens' eyes stay closed?\nDuring the first week-and-a-half of their lives, kittens\u2019 eyes are sealed closed and their ears are folded up, making them practically blind and deaf. They\u2019re born this way because their brains aren\u2019t developed enough to use those senses. \n \n---+ Read the entire article on KQED Science:\nhttps://www.kqed.org/science/1930803/how-kittens-go-from-clueless-to-cute \n\n---+ For more information:\nIf you find a litter of newborn kittens: https://eastbayspca.org/get-involved/community-resources/feral-cats/stray-cats-feral-cats-kittens/\n\n---+ More Great Deep Look episodes:\n\nWhy Does Your Cat\u2019s Tongue Feel Like Sandpaper? \nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9h_QtLol75I&t=24s\n\nWatch This Bee Build Her Bee-jeweled Nest\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oPbH1YhsdP8\n\n---+ See some great videos and documentaries from PBS Digital Studios!\n\nIt\u2019s Okay to Be Smart: Why Do Disney Princesses All Look Like Babies?\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T1gzpEktyKo\n\nPBS Eons: The Story of Saberteeth\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hbjIhPHRZgc\n\n---+ Follow KQED Science:\n\nKQED Science: http://www.kqed.org/science\nTumblr: http://kqedscience.tumblr.com\nTwitter: https://www.twitter.com/kqedscience\n\n---+ About KQED\n\nKQED, an NPR and PBS affiliate in San Francisco, CA, serves Northern California and beyond with a public-supported alternative to commercial TV, radio and web media.\n\nFunding for Deep Look is provided in part by PBS Digital Studios.

Practically deaf and blind, in their first few weeks they need constant warmth and milk to survive. This is a huge challenge for animal shelters, so they're working with researchers on ways to help motherless kittens flourish.\n\nSUBSCRIBE to Deep Look! http://goo.gl/8NwXqt\n\nDEEP LOOK is a ultra-HD (4K) short video series created by KQED San Francisco and presented by PBS Digital Studios.

Explore big scientific mysteries by going incredibly small.\n\n--\n\nEvery year, hundreds of thousands of kittens end up in animal shelters, in need of permanent homes.\n\nBut raising orphaned newborns into healthy, fluffy, frisky two-month-olds ready to be adopted requires an enormous behind-the-scenes effort. All across the country, volunteer foster parents log many sleepless nights bottle-feeding kittens every few hours. So researchers and shelters are trying to figure out ways to make it easier. \n\n\u201cA lot of people think fostering is taking kittens home and playing with them,\u201d said Penny Dougherty, chief executive director of Kitten Central of Placer County, an animal shelter she runs from her house in Newcastle, California, 30 miles northeast of Sacramento.\n\nKitten Central receives most of its kittens from Placer County Animal Services. Dougherty cares for kittens up to one month old, as well as feral and stray cats with litters. Once the kittens weigh at least two pounds and have been spayed and neutered, she returns them to the agency so they can put them up for adoption. \n\n\u201cThey\u2019re very happy to have our services,\u201d said Dougherty, \u201cbecause so many shelters have to euthanize.\u201d \n\nWhen the days start getting longer, around January, cats start breeding. March is the beginning of what\u2019s known among shelters as \u201ckitten season.\u201d The flow of kittens doesn\u2019t slow down until November.\n\n\u201cKitten season is kind of one of the banes of shelter existence,\u201d said Cynthia Delany, supervising shelter veterinarian at Yolo County Animal Services, in Woodland, west of Sacramento. \u201cSix or seven months out of the year we\u2019re just flooded with these little guys.\u201d \n\nTo steer clear of inundating shelters with newborn kittens, Delany\u2019s advice is to leave any litters you might encounter alone unless they\u2019re in immediate danger. Most of the time their mom will return, she said, so check back periodically.\n\nIn an effort to lessen the load on foster parents and increase newborn kittens\u2019 chances of survival, Mikel Maria Delgado, a postdoctoral researcher in the School of Veterinary Medicine at the University of California, Davis, is joining forces with Kitten Central and other animal shelters to figure out if there are optimum temperature and humidity levels that make it possible to feed newborn kittens less frequently. She has distributed incubators to the groups so that two or three kittens can be kept in each one for about three weeks.\n\n---How long do kittens' eyes stay closed?\nDuring the first week-and-a-half of their lives, kittens\u2019 eyes are sealed closed and their ears are folded up, making them practically blind and deaf. They\u2019re born this way because their brains aren\u2019t developed enough to use those senses. \n \n---+ Read the entire article on KQED Science:\nhttps://www.kqed.org/science/1930803/how-kittens-go-from-clueless-to-cute \n\n---+ For more information:\nIf you find a litter of newborn kittens: https://eastbayspca.org/get-involved/community-resources/feral-cats/stray-cats-feral-cats-kittens/\n\n---+ More Great Deep Look episodes:\n\nWhy Does Your Cat\u2019s Tongue Feel Like Sandpaper? \nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9h_QtLol75I&t=24s\n\nWatch This Bee Build Her Bee-jeweled Nest\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oPbH1YhsdP8\n\n---+ See some great videos and documentaries from PBS Digital Studios!\n\nIt\u2019s Okay to Be Smart: Why Do Disney Princesses All Look Like Babies?\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T1gzpEktyKo\n\nPBS Eons: The Story of Saberteeth\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hbjIhPHRZgc\n\n---+ Follow KQED Science:\n\nKQED Science: http://www.kqed.org/science\nTumblr: http://kqedscience.tumblr.com\nTwitter: https://www.twitter.com/kqedscience\n\n---+ About KQED\n\nKQED, an NPR and PBS affiliate in San Francisco, CA, serves Northern California and beyond with a public-supported alternative to commercial TV, radio and web media.\n\nFunding for Deep Look is provided in part by PBS Digital Studios.

And some aren\u2019t above stealing weapons from their prey.\n\nGosliner and Brenna Green and Emily Otstott, graduate students at San Francisco State University, were out at dawn earlier this summer searching tidepools and floating docks around the Bay Area. They want to learn more about how these delicate little sea slugs survive and how changing ocean temperatures might threaten their futures.\n\nNudibranchs come in a staggering variety of shapes and sizes. Many accumulate toxic or bad-tasting chemicals from their prey, causing predators like fish and crabs to learn that the flashy colors mean the nudibranch wouldn\u2019t make a good meal.\n\n--- What are nudibranchs?\nNudibranchs are snails that lost their shell over evolutionary time. Since they don\u2019t have a shell for protection, they have to use other ways to defend themselves like accumulating toxic chemicals in their flesh to make them taste bad to predators. Some species of nudibranchs eat relatives of jellyfish and accumulate the stingers within their bodies for defense.\n\n--- Why do nudibranchs have such bright colors?\nThe bright colors serve as a signal to the nudibranch\u2019s predators that they are not good to eat. If a fish or crab bites a nudibranch, it learns to associate the bad taste with the bright colors which tends to make them reluctant to bite a nudibranch with those colors in the future. \n\n--- What does nudibranch mean?\nThe word nudibranch comes from Latin. It means naked gills. They got that name because some species of nudibranchs have an exposed ring of gills on their back that they use to breath.  \n\n---+ Read the entire article on KQED Science:\nhttps://www.kqed.org/science/1929993/this-adorable-sea-slug-is-a-sneaky-little-thief\n\n---+ For more information:\n\nLearn more about Terry Gosliner\u2019s work with nudibranchs\nhttps://www.calacademy.org/staff/ibss/invertebrate-zoology-and-geology/terrence-gosliner\n\nLearn more about Chris Lowe\u2019s work with plankton\nhttp://lowe.stanford.edu/\n\nLearn more about Jessica Goodheart\u2019s study of nematocyst sequestration\nhttps://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/ivb.12154\n\n---+ More Great Deep Look episodes:\n\nFrom Drifter to Dynamo: The Story of Plankton | Deep Look\nhttps://youtu.be/jUvJ5ANH86I\n\nFor Pacific Mole Crabs It's Dig or Die | Deep Look\nhttps://youtu.be/tfoYD8pAsMw\n\n---+ See some great videos and documentaries from PBS Digital Studios!\n\nWhy Are Hurricanes Getting Stronger? | Hot Mess\nhttps://youtu.be/2E1Nt7JQRzc\n\nWhen Fish Wore Armor | Eons\nhttps://youtu.be/5pVTZH1LyTw\n\nWhy Do We Wash Our Hands After Going to the Bathroom? | Origin of Everything\nhttps://youtu.be/fKlpGs34-_g\n\n---+ Follow KQED Science and Deep Look:\n\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/kqedscience/\nTwitter: https://www.twitter.com/kqedscience\nKQED Science on kqed.org: http://www.kqed.org/science\nFacebook Watch: https://www.facebook.com/DeepLookPBS/\nPatreon: https://www.patreon.com/deeplook\n\n---+ About KQED\n\nKQED, an NPR and PBS affiliate in San Francisco, CA, serves Northern California and beyond with a public-supported alternative to commercial TV, Radio and web media.\n\nFunding for Deep Look is provided in part by PBS Digital Studios.

And they\u2019re particularly well-suited to pollinate almonds, which are in bloom in February, when it\u2019s chilly in California\u2019s Central Valley, because they will fly around and forage at a cooler temperature than honeybees.  \n\n---+ Read the article on KQED Science:\nhttps://www.kqed.org/science/1928378/watch-this-bee-build-her-bee-jeweled-nest\n\n\n---+ For more information:\nDownload the free book How to Manage the Blue Orchard Bee:\nhttps://www.sare.org/Learning-Center/Books/How-to-Manage-the-Blue-Orchard-Bee\n\n---+ More Great Deep Look episodes:\n\nThis Vibrating Bumblebee Unlocks a Flower\u2019s Hidden Treasure\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SZrTndD1H10\n\nWhat Do Earwigs Do With Those Pincers Anyway?\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HuOnqWpIL9E\n\n---+ See some great videos and documentaries from PBS Digital Studios!\n\nPBS Eons: When Insects First Flew\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7QMcXEj7IT0\n\nCrashCourse: The Plants & The Bees: Plant Reproduction - CrashCourse Biology #38\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ExaQ8shhkw8\n\n---+ Follow KQED Science:\n\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/kqedscience/\nTwitter: https://www.twitter.com/kqedscience\nKQED Science on kqed.org: http://www.kqed.org/science\nFacebook Watch: https://www.facebook.com/DeepLookPBS/\nPatreon: https://www.patreon.com/deeplook\n\n\n---+ About KQED\n\nKQED, an NPR and PBS affiliate in San Francisco, CA, serves Northern California and beyond with a public-supported alternative to commercial TV, radio and web media.\n\nFunding for Deep Look is provided in part by PBS Digital Studios.

                "description": "African elephants may have magnificent ears, but on the savanna, they communicate over vast distances by picking up underground signals with their sensitive, fatty feet.\n\nYou can learn more about CuriosityStream at https://curiositystream.com/deeplook.\nLove Deep Look? Join us on Patreon! https://www.patreon.com/deeplook \nSUBSCRIBE to Deep Look! http://goo.gl/8NwXqt\n\nDEEP LOOK is a ultra-HD (4K) short video series created by KQED San Francisco and presented by PBS Digital Studios. See the unseen at the very edge of our visible world. Explore big scientific mysteries by going incredibly small.\n\nThousands of elephants roam Etosha National Park in Namibia, a nation in southwest Africa, taking turns at the park\u2019s numerous watering holes. The elephants exchange information by emitting low-frequency sounds that travel dozens of miles under the ground on the savannah. \n\nThe sound waves come from the animals\u2019 huge vocal chords, and distant elephants \u201chear\u201d the signals with their highly sensitive feet. The sound waves spread out through the ground and air. By triangulating the two types of signals using both ears and feet, elephants can tune into the direction, distance and content of a message.\n\nSeismic communication is the key to understanding the complex dynamics of elephant communities. There are seismic messages that are sent passively, such as when elephants eavesdrop on each others\u2019 footsteps. More active announcements include alarm cries, mating calls and navigation instructions to the herd. \n\nSeismic communication works with elephants because of the incredible sensitivity of their feet. Like all mammals, including humans, elephants have receptors called Pacinian corpuscles, or PCs, in their skin. PCs are hard-wired to a part of the brain where touch signals are processed, called the somatosensory cortex. \n\nIn elephants, PCs are clustered around the edge of the foot. When picking up a far-off signal, elephants sometimes press their feet into the ground, enlarging its surface by as much as 20 percent. \n\nStrictly speaking, when elephants pick up ground vibrations in thei feet, it\u2019s their sense of feeling, not hearing, at work. Typically hearing happens without physical contact, when airborne vibrations hit the eardrum, causing the tiny bones of the inner ear tremble and transmit a message to the brain along the auditory nerve. \n\nBut in elephants, some ground vibrations actually reach the hearing centers of the brain through a process called bone conduction. \n\nBy modeling how the elephant\u2019s inner ear bones respond to seismic sound waves, scientists are hoping to use a bone-conduction approach develop new and better hearing aids for people. Instead of amplifying sound waves through the ear canal, these devices would transmit sound vibrations into a person\u2019s jawbone or skull. \n\n--- Where did you film this episode?\n\nIt was filmed in Etosha National Park in Namibia, at Menasha watering hole, which is closed to the public. We also filmed with the elephants at the Performing Animal Welfare Society (PAWS) sanctuary in San Andreas, Calif. \n\n--- Do all elephants communicate seismically?\n\nBoth species of elephants \u2013 Asian and African \u2013 can pick up vibrations in their feet. There are some differences in anatomy between the two species, which cannot interbreed. Those include attributes related to their hearing, and probably arose as adaptations to their distinct habitats.\n\n---+ Read the entire article on KQED Science:\n\nhttps://ww2.kqed.org/science/2018/07/17/how-elephants-listen-with-their-feet\n\n---+ For more information:\n\nVisit Caitlin O\u2019Connell-Rodwell\u2019s non-profit, Utopia Scientific.

                    "description": "African elephants may have magnificent ears, but on the savanna, they communicate over vast distances by picking up underground signals with their sensitive, fatty feet.\n\nYou can learn more about CuriosityStream at https://curiositystream.com/deeplook.\nLove Deep Look?

See the unseen at the very edge of our visible world. Explore big scientific mysteries by going incredibly small.\n\nThousands of elephants roam Etosha National Park in Namibia, a nation in southwest Africa, taking turns at the park\u2019s numerous watering holes. The elephants exchange information by emitting low-frequency sounds that travel dozens of miles under the ground on the savannah. \n\nThe sound waves come from the animals\u2019 huge vocal chords, and distant elephants \u201chear\u201d the signals with their highly sensitive feet. The sound waves spread out through the ground and air. By triangulating the two types of signals using both ears and feet, elephants can tune into the direction, distance and content of a message.\n\nSeismic communication is the key to understanding the complex dynamics of elephant communities. There are seismic messages that are sent passively, such as when elephants eavesdrop on each others\u2019 footsteps. More active announcements include alarm cries, mating calls and navigation instructions to the herd. \n\nSeismic communication works with elephants because of the incredible sensitivity of their feet. Like all mammals, including humans, elephants have receptors called Pacinian corpuscles, or PCs, in their skin. PCs are hard-wired to a part of the brain where touch signals are processed, called the somatosensory cortex. \n\nIn elephants, PCs are clustered around the edge of the foot. When picking up a far-off signal, elephants sometimes press their feet into the ground, enlarging its surface by as much as 20 percent. \n\nStrictly speaking, when elephants pick up ground vibrations in thei feet, it\u2019s their sense of feeling, not hearing, at work. Typically hearing happens without physical contact, when airborne vibrations hit the eardrum, causing the tiny bones of the inner ear tremble and transmit a message to the brain along the auditory nerve. \n\nBut in elephants, some ground vibrations actually reach the hearing centers of the brain through a process called bone conduction. \n\nBy modeling how the elephant\u2019s inner ear bones respond to seismic sound waves, scientists are hoping to use a bone-conduction approach develop new and better hearing aids for people. Instead of amplifying sound waves through the ear canal, these devices would transmit sound vibrations into a person\u2019s jawbone or skull. \n\n--- Where did you film this episode?\n\nIt was filmed in Etosha National Park in Namibia, at Menasha watering hole, which is closed to the public. We also filmed with the elephants at the Performing Animal Welfare Society (PAWS) sanctuary in San Andreas, Calif. \n\n--- Do all elephants communicate seismically?\n\nBoth species of elephants \u2013 Asian and African \u2013 can pick up vibrations in their feet. There are some differences in anatomy between the two species, which cannot interbreed. Those include attributes related to their hearing, and probably arose as adaptations to their distinct habitats.\n\n---+ Read the entire article on KQED Science:\n\nhttps://ww2.kqed.org/science/2018/07/17/how-elephants-listen-with-their-feet\n\n---+ For more information:\n\nVisit Caitlin O\u2019Connell-Rodwell\u2019s non-profit, Utopia Scientific.

They don\u2019t mind people staring at them and they\u2019re easy to find. They greet each other with loud cries that sound like \u201cwaka-waka-waka.\u201d \n\nThey\u2019re also found in Oregon, Arizona, New Mexico and Texas, and all the way south to Colombia.\n\nThese avian performers are constantly tapping, drilling and pounding at their granaries. \n\n\u201cThey\u2019ll usually have a central granary, maybe two trees that a group is using,\u201d said Koenig. \u201cThose trees are going to be close together.\u201d\n\nAcorn woodpeckers make their granaries in pines, oaks, sycamores, redwoods and even in the palm trees on the Stanford University campus. \n\nTheir holes rarely hurt the trees. The birds only bore into the bark, where there\u2019s no sap, or they make their granaries in snags.\n\n\u201cThey don\u2019t want sap in the hole because it will cause the acorn to rot,\u201d said Koenig. \u201cThe point of storing the acorns is that it protects them from other animals getting them and it allows them to dry out.\u201d\n\n--- What is an acorn?\nIt\u2019s the fruit of the oak.\n\n--- Do acorn woodpeckers only eat acorns?\nIn the spring, acorn woodpeckers have their choice of food.

These reef-dwelling hunters nab their prey in microseconds, then slowly eat them alive.\n\nSUBSCRIBE to Deep Look! http://goo.gl/8NwXqt\n\nDEEP LOOK is a ultra-HD (4K) short video series created by KQED San Francisco and presented by PBS Digital Studios. See the unseen at the very edge of our visible world. Explore big scientific mysteries by going incredibly small.\n\nNew research shows that cone snails \u2014 ocean-dwelling mollusks known for their brightly colored shells \u2014 attack their prey faster than almost any member of the animal kingdom. \n\nThere are hundreds of species of these normally slow-moving hunters found in oceans across the world. They take down fish, worms and other snails using a hollow, harpoon-like tooth that acts like a spear and a hypodermic needle. When they impale their prey, cone snails inject a chemical cocktail that subdues their meal and gives them time to dine at their leisure.\n\nCone snails launch their harpoons so quickly that scientists were previously unable to capture the movement on camera, making it impossible to calculate just how speedy these snails are. Now, using super-high-speed video, researchers have filmed the full flight of the harpoon for the first time.\n\nFrom start to finish, the harpoon\u2019s flight takes less than 200 micro-seconds. That\u2019s one five-thousandth of a second. It launches with an acceleration equivalent to a bullet fired from a pistol.\n\nSo how do these sedentary snails pull off such a high-octane feat? Hydrostatic pressure \u2014 the pressure from fluid \u2014 builds within the half of the snail\u2019s proboscis closest to its body, locked behind a tight o-ring of muscle. When it comes time to strike, the muscle relaxes, and the venom-laced fluid punches into the harpoon\u2019s bulbous base. This pressure launches the harpoon out into the snail\u2019s unsuspecting prey.\n\nAs fast as the harpoon launches, it comes to an even more abrupt stop. The base of the harpoon gets caught at the end of the proboscis so the snail can reel in its meal.\n\nThe high-speed action doesn\u2019t stop with the harpoon. Cone snail venom acts fast, subduing fish in as little as a few seconds. The venom is filled with unique molecules, broadly referred to as conotoxins. \n\nThe composition of cone snail venom varies from species to species, and even between individuals of the same species, creating a library of potential new drugs that researchers are eager to mine. In combination, these chemicals work together to rapidly paralyze a cone snail\u2019s prey. Individually, some molecules from cone snail venom can provide non-opioid pain relief, and could potentially treat Parkinson\u2019s disease or cancer.\n\n--- Where do cone snails live?\n\nThere are 500 species of cone snails living in the Indian and Pacific Oceans, the Caribbean and Red Seas, and the Florida coast.\n\n--- Can cone snails kill humans?\n\nMost of them do not. Only eight of those 500 species, including the geography cone, have been known to kill humans.\n\n--- Why are scientists interested in cone snails?\n\nCone snail venom is derived from thousands of small molecules call peptides that the snail makes under its shell. These peptides produce different effects on cells, which scientists hope to manipulate in the treatment of various diseases. \n\n---+ Read the entire article on KQED Science:\nhttps://wp.me/p6iq8L-84uC\n\n---+ For more information:\n\nHere\u2019s what WebMD says about treating a cone snail sting:\nhttps://www.webmd.com/a-to-z-guides/cone-snail-sting\n\n---+ More Great Deep Look episodes:\n\nThis Mushroom Starts Killing You Before You Even Realize It\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bl9aCH2QaQY\n\nTake Two Leeches and Call Me in the Morning\nhttps://youtu.be/O-0SFWPLaII\n\n---+ See some great videos and documentaries from the PBS Digital Studios!\n\nSpace Time: Quantum Mechanics Playlist\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-IfmgyXs7z8&list=PLsPUh22kYmNCGaVGuGfKfJl-6RdHiCjo1\n\nAbove The Noise: Endangered Species: Worth Saving from Extinction?\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h5eTqjzQZDY\n\n---+ Follow KQED Science:\n\nKQED Science: http://www.kqed.org/science\nTumblr: http://kqedscience.tumblr.com\nTwitter: https://www.twitter.com/kqedscience\n\n---+ About KQED\n\nKQED, an NPR and PBS affiliate in San Francisco, CA, serves Northern California and beyond with a public-supported alternative to commercial TV, Radio and web media.\n\nFunding for Deep Look is provided in part by PBS Digital Studios.

These reef-dwelling hunters nab their prey in microseconds, then slowly eat them alive.\n\nSUBSCRIBE to Deep Look! http://goo.gl/8NwXqt\n\nDEEP LOOK is a ultra-HD (4K) short video series created by KQED San Francisco and presented by PBS Digital Studios. See the unseen at the very edge of our visible world. Explore big scientific mysteries by going incredibly small.\n\nNew research shows that cone snails \u2014 ocean-dwelling mollusks known for their brightly colored shells \u2014 attack their prey faster than almost any member of the animal kingdom. \n\nThere are hundreds of species of these normally slow-moving hunters found in oceans across the world. They take down fish, worms and other snails using a hollow, harpoon-like tooth that acts like a spear and a hypodermic needle. When they impale their prey, cone snails inject a chemical cocktail that subdues their meal and gives them time to dine at their leisure.\n\nCone snails launch their harpoons so quickly that scientists were previously unable to capture the movement on camera, making it impossible to calculate just how speedy these snails are. Now, using super-high-speed video, researchers have filmed the full flight of the harpoon for the first time.\n\nFrom start to finish, the harpoon\u2019s flight takes less than 200 micro-seconds. That\u2019s one five-thousandth of a second. It launches with an acceleration equivalent to a bullet fired from a pistol.\n\nSo how do these sedentary snails pull off such a high-octane feat? Hydrostatic pressure \u2014 the pressure from fluid \u2014 builds within the half of the snail\u2019s proboscis closest to its body, locked behind a tight o-ring of muscle. When it comes time to strike, the muscle relaxes, and the venom-laced fluid punches into the harpoon\u2019s bulbous base. This pressure launches the harpoon out into the snail\u2019s unsuspecting prey.\n\nAs fast as the harpoon launches, it comes to an even more abrupt stop. The base of the harpoon gets caught at the end of the proboscis so the snail can reel in its meal.\n\nThe high-speed action doesn\u2019t stop with the harpoon. Cone snail venom acts fast, subduing fish in as little as a few seconds. The venom is filled with unique molecules, broadly referred to as conotoxins. \n\nThe composition of cone snail venom varies from species to species, and even between individuals of the same species, creating a library of potential new drugs that researchers are eager to mine. In combination, these chemicals work together to rapidly paralyze a cone snail\u2019s prey. Individually, some molecules from cone snail venom can provide non-opioid pain relief, and could potentially treat Parkinson\u2019s disease or cancer.\n\n--- Where do cone snails live?\n\nThere are 500 species of cone snails living in the Indian and Pacific Oceans, the Caribbean and Red Seas, and the Florida coast.\n\n--- Can cone snails kill humans?\n\nMost of them do not. Only eight of those 500 species, including the geography cone, have been known to kill humans.\n\n--- Why are scientists interested in cone snails?\n\nCone snail venom is derived from thousands of small molecules call peptides that the snail makes under its shell. These peptides produce different effects on cells, which scientists hope to manipulate in the treatment of various diseases. \n\n---+ Read the entire article on KQED Science:\nhttps://wp.me/p6iq8L-84uC\n\n---+ For more information:\n\nHere\u2019s what WebMD says about treating a cone snail sting:\nhttps://www.webmd.com/a-to-z-guides/cone-snail-sting\n\n---+ More Great Deep Look episodes:\n\nThis Mushroom Starts Killing You Before You Even Realize It\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bl9aCH2QaQY\n\nTake Two Leeches and Call Me in the Morning\nhttps://youtu.be/O-0SFWPLaII\n\n---+ See some great videos and documentaries from the PBS Digital Studios!\n\nSpace Time: Quantum Mechanics Playlist\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-IfmgyXs7z8&list=PLsPUh22kYmNCGaVGuGfKfJl-6RdHiCjo1\n\nAbove The Noise: Endangered Species: Worth Saving from Extinction?\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h5eTqjzQZDY\n\n---+ Follow KQED Science:\n\nKQED Science: http://www.kqed.org/science\nTumblr: http://kqedscience.tumblr.com\nTwitter: https://www.twitter.com/kqedscience\n\n---+ About KQED\n\nKQED, an NPR and PBS affiliate in San Francisco, CA, serves Northern California and beyond with a public-supported alternative to commercial TV, Radio and web media.\n\nFunding for Deep Look is provided in part by PBS Digital Studios.

Mobbing also teaches new generations of crows to identify predators.\n\n---+ Read the entire article on KQED Science:\nhttps://www.kqed.org/science/1923458/youve-heard-of-a-murder-of-crows-how-about-a-crow-funeral/\n\n---+ For more information:\nKaeli Swift\u2019s Corvid Research website\nhttps://corvidresearch.blog/\n\nUniversity of Washington Avian Conservation Laboratory\nhttp://sefs.washington.edu/research.acl/\n\n---+ More Great Deep Look episodes:\n\nWhy Do Tumbleweeds Tumble? | Deep Look\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dATZsuPdOnM\n\nUpside-Down Catfish Doesn't Care What You Think | Deep Look\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eurCBOJMrsE\n\nTake Two Leeches and Call Me in the Morning | Deep Look\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-0SFWPLaII\n\n---+ See some great videos and documentaries from PBS Digital Studios!\n\nWhy Climate Change is Unjust | Hot Mess\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q5KjpYK12_c\n\nIs Breakfast the Most Important Meal? | Origin Of Everything\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AxIOGqHQqZM\n\nHow the Squid Lost Its Shell | PBS Eons\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S4vxoP-IF2M\n\n---+ Follow KQED Science:\n\nKQED Science: http://www.kqed.org/science\nTumblr: http://kqedscience.tumblr.com\nTwitter: https://www.twitter.com/kqedscience\n\n---+ About KQED\n\nKQED, an NPR and PBS affiliate in San Francisco, CA, serves Northern California and beyond with a public-supported alternative to commercial TV, Radio and web media.\n\nFunding for Deep Look is provided in part by PBS Digital Studios.

                "description": "You might suppose this catfish is sick, or just confused. But swimming belly-up actually helps it camouflage and breathe better than its right-side-up cousins. \n\nSUBSCRIBE to Deep Look! http://goo.gl/8NwXqt\n\nDEEP LOOK: a new ultra-HD (4K) short video series created by KQED San Francisco and presented by PBS Digital Studios.

Explore big scientific mysteries by going incredibly small.\n\nNormally, an upside-down fish in your tank is bad news. As in, it\u2019s time for a new goldfish.\n\nThat\u2019s because most fish have an internal air sac called a \u201cswim bladder\u201d that allows them to control their buoyancy and orientation. They fill the bladder with air when they want to rise, and deflate it when they want to sink. Fish without swim bladders, like sharks, have to swim constantly to keep from dropping to the bottom.\n\nIf an aquarium fish is listing to one side or flops over on its back, it often means it has swim bladder disease, a potentially life-threatening condition usually brought on parasites, overfeeding, or high nitrate levels in the water. \n\nBut for a few remarkable fish, being upside-down means everything is great.\n\nIn fact, seven species of catfish native to Central Africa live most of their lives upended. These topsy-turvy swimmers are anatomically identical to their right-side up cousins, despite having such an unusual orientation. \n\nPeople\u2019s fascination with the odd alignment of these fish goes back centuries. Studies of these quizzical fish have found a number of reasons why swimming upside down makes a lot of sense.\n\nIn an upside-down position, fish produce a lot less wave drag. That means upside-down catfish do a better job feeding on insect larvae at the waterline than their right-side up counterparts, who have to return to deeper water to rest. \n\nThere\u2019s something else at the surface that\u2019s even more important to a fish\u2019s survival than food: oxygen. The gas essential to life readily dissolves from the air into the water, where it becomes concentrated in a thin layer at the waterline \u2014 right where the upside-down catfish\u2019s mouth and gills are perfectly positioned to get it. \n\nScientists estimate that upside-down catfishes have been working out their survival strategy for as long at 35 million years. Besides their breathing and feeding behavior, the blotched upside-down catfish from the Congo Basin has also evolved a dark patch on its underside to make it harder to see against dark water.\n\nThat coloration is remarkable because it\u2019s the opposite of most sea creatures, which tend to be darker on top and lighter on the bottom, a common adaptation called \u201ccountershading\u201d that offsets the effects of sunlight.\n\nThe blotched upside-down catfish\u2019s \u201creverse\u201d countershading has earned it the scientific name negriventris, which means black-bellied.\n\n--- How many kinds of fish swim upside down?\n\nA total of seven species in Africa swim that way. Upside-down swimming may have evolved independent in a few of the species \u2013 and at least one more time in a catfish from Asia.\n\n--- How do fish stay upright?\n\nThey have an air-filled swim bladder on the inside that that they can fill or deflate to maintain balance or to move up or down in the water column.\n\n--- What are the benefits of swimming upside down?\n\nUpside down, a fish swims more efficiently at the waterline, where there\u2019s more oxygen and better access to some prey.  \n\n---+ Read the entire article on KQED Science:\n\nhttps://www.kqed.org/science/1922038/the-mystery-of-the-upside-down-catfish\n\n---+ For more information:\n\nThe California Academy of Sciences has upside-down catfish in its aquarium collection: https://www.calacademy.org/exhibits/steinhart-aquarium\n\n---+ More Great Deep Look episodes:\n\nTake Two Leeches and Call Me in the Morning\nhttps://youtu.be/O-0SFWPLaII\n\nThis Is Why Water Striders Make Terrible Lifeguards\nhttps://youtu.be/E2unnSK7WTE\n\n---+ See some great videos and documentaries from the PBS Digital Studios!\n\nPBS Eons: What a Dinosaur Looks Like Under a Microscope\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rvgiDXc12k\n\nOrigin of Everything: The Origin of Race in the USA\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVxAlmAPHec\n\n---+ Follow KQED Science:\n\nKQED Science: http://www.kqed.org/science\nTumblr: http://kqedscience.tumblr.com\nTwitter: https://www.twitter.com/kqedscience\n\n---+ About KQED\n\nKQED, an NPR and PBS affiliate in San Francisco, CA, serves Northern California and beyond with a public-supported alternative to commercial TV, Radio and web media.\n\nFunding for Deep Look is provided in part by PBS Digital Studios.

                    "description": "You might suppose this catfish is sick, or just confused. But swimming belly-up actually helps it camouflage and breathe better than its right-side-up cousins. \n\nSUBSCRIBE to Deep Look! http://goo.gl/8NwXqt\n\nDEEP LOOK: a new ultra-HD (4K) short video series created by KQED San Francisco and presented by PBS Digital Studios.

Explore big scientific mysteries by going incredibly small.\n\nNormally, an upside-down fish in your tank is bad news. As in, it\u2019s time for a new goldfish.\n\nThat\u2019s because most fish have an internal air sac called a \u201cswim bladder\u201d that allows them to control their buoyancy and orientation. They fill the bladder with air when they want to rise, and deflate it when they want to sink. Fish without swim bladders, like sharks, have to swim constantly to keep from dropping to the bottom.\n\nIf an aquarium fish is listing to one side or flops over on its back, it often means it has swim bladder disease, a potentially life-threatening condition usually brought on parasites, overfeeding, or high nitrate levels in the water. \n\nBut for a few remarkable fish, being upside-down means everything is great.\n\nIn fact, seven species of catfish native to Central Africa live most of their lives upended. These topsy-turvy swimmers are anatomically identical to their right-side up cousins, despite having such an unusual orientation. \n\nPeople\u2019s fascination with the odd alignment of these fish goes back centuries. Studies of these quizzical fish have found a number of reasons why swimming upside down makes a lot of sense.\n\nIn an upside-down position, fish produce a lot less wave drag. That means upside-down catfish do a better job feeding on insect larvae at the waterline than their right-side up counterparts, who have to return to deeper water to rest. \n\nThere\u2019s something else at the surface that\u2019s even more important to a fish\u2019s survival than food: oxygen. The gas essential to life readily dissolves from the air into the water, where it becomes concentrated in a thin layer at the waterline \u2014 right where the upside-down catfish\u2019s mouth and gills are perfectly positioned to get it. \n\nScientists estimate that upside-down catfishes have been working out their survival strategy for as long at 35 million years. Besides their breathing and feeding behavior, the blotched upside-down catfish from the Congo Basin has also evolved a dark patch on its underside to make it harder to see against dark water.\n\nThat coloration is remarkable because it\u2019s the opposite of most sea creatures, which tend to be darker on top and lighter on the bottom, a common adaptation called \u201ccountershading\u201d that offsets the effects of sunlight.\n\nThe blotched upside-down catfish\u2019s \u201creverse\u201d countershading has earned it the scientific name negriventris, which means black-bellied.\n\n--- How many kinds of fish swim upside down?\n\nA total of seven species in Africa swim that way. Upside-down swimming may have evolved independent in a few of the species \u2013 and at least one more time in a catfish from Asia.\n\n--- How do fish stay upright?\n\nThey have an air-filled swim bladder on the inside that that they can fill or deflate to maintain balance or to move up or down in the water column.\n\n--- What are the benefits of swimming upside down?\n\nUpside down, a fish swims more efficiently at the waterline, where there\u2019s more oxygen and better access to some prey.  \n\n---+ Read the entire article on KQED Science:\n\nhttps://www.kqed.org/science/1922038/the-mystery-of-the-upside-down-catfish\n\n---+ For more information:\n\nThe California Academy of Sciences has upside-down catfish in its aquarium collection: https://www.calacademy.org/exhibits/steinhart-aquarium\n\n---+ More Great Deep Look episodes:\n\nTake Two Leeches and Call Me in the Morning\nhttps://youtu.be/O-0SFWPLaII\n\nThis Is Why Water Striders Make Terrible Lifeguards\nhttps://youtu.be/E2unnSK7WTE\n\n---+ See some great videos and documentaries from the PBS Digital Studios!\n\nPBS Eons: What a Dinosaur Looks Like Under a Microscope\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rvgiDXc12k\n\nOrigin of Everything: The Origin of Race in the USA\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVxAlmAPHec\n\n---+ Follow KQED Science:\n\nKQED Science: http://www.kqed.org/science\nTumblr: http://kqedscience.tumblr.com\nTwitter: https://www.twitter.com/kqedscience\n\n---+ About KQED\n\nKQED, an NPR and PBS affiliate in San Francisco, CA, serves Northern California and beyond with a public-supported alternative to commercial TV, Radio and web media.\n\nFunding for Deep Look is provided in part by PBS Digital Studios.

Contrary to the typical, derogatory definition of a human \u201cleech,\u201d this critter is increasingly playing a key role as a sidekick for scientists and doctors, simply by being its bloodthirsty self.\n\nDistant cousins of the earthworm, most leech species are parasites that feed on the blood of animals and humans alike. They are often found in freshwater and navigate either by swimming or by inching themselves along, using two suckers\u2014one at each end of their body\u2014to anchor themselves.\n\nUpon reaching an unsuspecting host, a leech will surreptitiously attach itself and begin to feed. It uses a triangular set of three teeth to cut in, and secretes a suite of chemicals to thin the blood and numb the skin so its presence goes undetected.\n\n---+ Read the entire article on KQED Science: https://www.kqed.org/science/1921659/take-two-leeches-and-call-me-in-the-morning\n\n---+ For more information: \nDavid Weisblat at UC Berkeley studies leeches development and evolution\nhttps://mcb.berkeley.edu/labs/weisblat/research.html\n\nBiologists recently reported that leeches in that region can provide a valuable snapshot of which animals are present in a particular area\nhttps://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/14772000.2018.1433729?journalCode=tsab20&\n\n---+ More Great Deep Look episodes: \n\nWhy the Male Black Widow is a Real Home Wrecker | Deep Look\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NpJNeGqExrc\n\nFor Pacific Mole Crabs It's Dig or Die | Deep Look\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfoYD8pAsMw\n\nPraying Mantis Love is Waaay Weirder Than You Think | Deep Look\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NHf47gI8w04&t=83s\n\n---+ See some great videos and documentaries from the PBS Digital Studios!

Humphrey Bogart\u2019s character in the 1951 film The African Queen even went so far as to call them \u201cfilthy little devils.\u201d\n\nBut the humble leech is making a comeback. Contrary to the typical, derogatory definition of a human \u201cleech,\u201d this critter is increasingly playing a key role as a sidekick for scientists and doctors, simply by being its bloodthirsty self.\n\nDistant cousins of the earthworm, most leech species are parasites that feed on the blood of animals and humans alike. They are often found in freshwater and navigate either by swimming or by inching themselves along, using two suckers\u2014one at each end of their body\u2014to anchor themselves.\n\nUpon reaching an unsuspecting host, a leech will surreptitiously attach itself and begin to feed. It uses a triangular set of three teeth to cut in, and secretes a suite of chemicals to thin the blood and numb the skin so its presence goes undetected.\n\n---+ Read the entire article on KQED Science: https://www.kqed.org/science/1921659/take-two-leeches-and-call-me-in-the-morning\n\n---+ For more information: \nDavid Weisblat at UC Berkeley studies leeches development and evolution\nhttps://mcb.berkeley.edu/labs/weisblat/research.html\n\nBiologists recently reported that leeches in that region can provide a valuable snapshot of which animals are present in a particular area\nhttps://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/14772000.2018.1433729?journalCode=tsab20&\n\n---+ More Great Deep Look episodes: \n\nWhy the Male Black Widow is a Real Home Wrecker | Deep Look\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NpJNeGqExrc\n\nFor Pacific Mole Crabs It's Dig or Die | Deep Look\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfoYD8pAsMw\n\nPraying Mantis Love is Waaay Weirder Than You Think | Deep Look\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NHf47gI8w04&t=83s\n\n---+ See some great videos and documentaries from the PBS Digital Studios!

                "description": "Most firefly flashes are pure romance, a sexy form of skywriting. But one variety copies the mating signals of others to lure them to their demise.\n\nSUBSCRIBE to Deep Look! http://goo.gl/8NwXqt\n\nDEEP LOOK: a new ultra-HD (4K) short video series created by KQED San Francisco and presented by PBS Digital Studios. See the unseen at the very edge of our visible world. Get a new perspective on our place in the universe and meet extraordinary new friends. Explore big scientific mysteries by going incredibly small.\n\nMost of the blinking signals that fireflies send out are intended to attract mates. But researchers are finding out that in some cases, these romantic overtures are not all wine and roses.\n\nFemales of one firefly group, the genus Photuris, have learned to copy other fireflies\u2019 flashes to attract the males of those species. When one arrives, she pounces, first sucking his blood, then devouring his insides.\n\nThese \u201cfemme fatale\u201d fireflies live throughout the Eastern U.S alongside the fireflies they target. They can develop widely varying light shows to target whatever species are in the area. \n\nThe predatory habits of Photuris are just one example of how much individual firefly signals can differ from one another.\n\nThe male Common Eastern Firefly, for example, is known for his fish hook-shaped aerial maneuver, which he repeats at six-second intervals.

Explore big scientific mysteries by going incredibly small.\n\nMost of the blinking signals that fireflies send out are intended to attract mates. But researchers are finding out that in some cases, these romantic overtures are not all wine and roses.\n\nFemales of one firefly group, the genus Photuris, have learned to copy other fireflies\u2019 flashes to attract the males of those species. When one arrives, she pounces, first sucking his blood, then devouring his insides.\n\nThese \u201cfemme fatale\u201d fireflies live throughout the Eastern U.S alongside the fireflies they target. They can develop widely varying light shows to target whatever species are in the area. \n\nThe predatory habits of Photuris are just one example of how much individual firefly signals can differ from one another.\n\nThe male Common Eastern Firefly, for example, is known for his fish hook-shaped aerial maneuver, which he repeats at six-second intervals. That characteristic move has earned the species the nickname \u201cBig Dipper.\u201d\n\nThe male Big Dipper hopes this bit of skywriting will get him noticed by females hiding in the grass. If the female likes what she sees, her reply comes as a single pulse from her smaller, heart-shaped lantern.

                "description": "Pacific mole crabs, also known as sand crabs, make their living just under the surface of the sand, where they're safe from breaking waves and hungry birds. Some very special physics help them dig with astonishing speed. \n\nSUBSCRIBE to Deep Look! http://goo.gl/8NwXqt\n\nDEEP LOOK is a ultra-HD (4K) short video series created by KQED San Francisco and presented by PBS Digital Studios.

Explore big scientific mysteries by going incredibly small.\n\n* NEW VIDEOS EVERY OTHER TUESDAY! *\n\nAmong the surfers and beach-casting anglers, there\u2019s a new visitor to San Francisco\u2019s Ocean Beach shoreline.\n\nBenjamin McInroe is there for only one reason -- to find Pacific mole crabs, a creature commonly known as \u201csand crabs\u201d -- and the tiny animals whose burrowing causes millions of small bubbles to appear on the beach as the tide comes in and out.\n\nMcInroe is a graduate student from UC Berkeley studying biophysics. He wants to know what makes these little creatures so proficient at digging their way through the wet sand.\n\nMcInroe hopes that he can one day copy their techniques to build a new generation of digging robots.\n\n-- What are Pacific Mole Crabs?\n\nPacific mole crabs, also known as sand crabs, are crustaceans, related to shrimp and lobsters. They have four pairs of legs and one pair of specialized legs in the front called uropods that look like paddles for digging in sand. Pacific mole crabs burrow through wet sand and stick their antennae out to catch bits of kelp and other debris kicked up by the breaking waves.\n\n-- What makes those holes in the sand at the beach?\n\nWhen the waves recede, mole crabs burrow down into the sand to keep from being exposed. They dig tail-first very quickly leaving holes in the wet sand. The holes bubble as water seeps into the holes and the air escapes.\n\n-- What do birds eat in the wet beach sand?\n\nShore birds like seagulls rush down the beach as the waves recede to catch mole crabs that haven\u2019t burrowed down quickly enough to escape. The birds typically run or fly away as the next wave breaks and rolls in.\n\n---+ Read the entire article on KQED Science:\n\nhttps://ww2.kqed.org/science/2018/02/13/for-pacific-mole-crabs-its-dig-or-die/\n\n---+ For more information:\n\nBenjamin McInroe, a Ph.D. student at UC Berkeley, studies how Pacific mole crabs burrow\nhttps://www.ocf.berkeley.edu/~bmcinroe/\n\nProfessor Robert Full directs the Poly-PEDAL Lab at UC Berkeley, where researchers study the physics of how animals and use that knowledge to build mechanical systems like robots based on their findings. \nhttp://polypedal.berkeley.edu/\n\n\n---+ More Great Deep Look episodes:\n\nDecorator Crabs Make High Fashion at Low Tide | Deep Look\nhttps://youtu.be/OwQcv7TyX04\n\nThese Fish Are All About Sex on the Beach | Deep Look\nhttps://youtu.be/j5F3z1iP0Ic\n\nSea Urchins Pull Themselves Inside Out to be Reborn | Deep Look\nhttps://youtu.be/ak2xqH5h0YY\n\nThere's Something Very Fishy About These Trees ... | Deep Look\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZWiWh5acbE&t=1s\n\n\n---+ See some great videos and documentaries from the PBS Digital Studios!\n\nWhy Do We Eat Artificial Flavors? | Origin of Everything \nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iNaJ31EV13U\n\nThe Facts About Dinosaurs & Feathers\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aOeFRg_1_Yg\n\nWhy Is Blue So Rare In Nature?\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3g246c6Bv58\n\n\n---+ Follow KQED Science\n\nKQED Science: http://www.kqed.org/science\nTumblr: http://kqedscience.tumblr.com\nTwitter: https://www.twitter.com/kqedscience\n\n---+ About KQED\n\nKQED, an NPR and PBS affiliate in San Francisco, CA, serves Northern California and beyond with a public-supported alternative to commercial TV, Radio and web media.\n\nFunding for Deep Look is provided in part by PBS Digital Studios.

Explore big scientific mysteries by going incredibly small.\n\n* NEW VIDEOS EVERY OTHER TUESDAY! *\n\nAmong the surfers and beach-casting anglers, there\u2019s a new visitor to San Francisco\u2019s Ocean Beach shoreline.\n\nBenjamin McInroe is there for only one reason -- to find Pacific mole crabs, a creature commonly known as \u201csand crabs\u201d -- and the tiny animals whose burrowing causes millions of small bubbles to appear on the beach as the tide comes in and out.\n\nMcInroe is a graduate student from UC Berkeley studying biophysics. He wants to know what makes these little creatures so proficient at digging their way through the wet sand.\n\nMcInroe hopes that he can one day copy their techniques to build a new generation of digging robots.\n\n-- What are Pacific Mole Crabs?\n\nPacific mole crabs, also known as sand crabs, are crustaceans, related to shrimp and lobsters. They have four pairs of legs and one pair of specialized legs in the front called uropods that look like paddles for digging in sand. Pacific mole crabs burrow through wet sand and stick their antennae out to catch bits of kelp and other debris kicked up by the breaking waves.\n\n-- What makes those holes in the sand at the beach?\n\nWhen the waves recede, mole crabs burrow down into the sand to keep from being exposed. They dig tail-first very quickly leaving holes in the wet sand. The holes bubble as water seeps into the holes and the air escapes.\n\n-- What do birds eat in the wet beach sand?\n\nShore birds like seagulls rush down the beach as the waves recede to catch mole crabs that haven\u2019t burrowed down quickly enough to escape. The birds typically run or fly away as the next wave breaks and rolls in.\n\n---+ Read the entire article on KQED Science:\n\nhttps://ww2.kqed.org/science/2018/02/13/for-pacific-mole-crabs-its-dig-or-die/\n\n---+ For more information:\n\nBenjamin McInroe, a Ph.D. student at UC Berkeley, studies how Pacific mole crabs burrow\nhttps://www.ocf.berkeley.edu/~bmcinroe/\n\nProfessor Robert Full directs the Poly-PEDAL Lab at UC Berkeley, where researchers study the physics of how animals and use that knowledge to build mechanical systems like robots based on their findings. \nhttp://polypedal.berkeley.edu/\n\n\n---+ More Great Deep Look episodes:\n\nDecorator Crabs Make High Fashion at Low Tide | Deep Look\nhttps://youtu.be/OwQcv7TyX04\n\nThese Fish Are All About Sex on the Beach | Deep Look\nhttps://youtu.be/j5F3z1iP0Ic\n\nSea Urchins Pull Themselves Inside Out to be Reborn | Deep Look\nhttps://youtu.be/ak2xqH5h0YY\n\nThere's Something Very Fishy About These Trees ... | Deep Look\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZWiWh5acbE&t=1s\n\n\n---+ See some great videos and documentaries from the PBS Digital Studios!\n\nWhy Do We Eat Artificial Flavors? | Origin of Everything \nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iNaJ31EV13U\n\nThe Facts About Dinosaurs & Feathers\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aOeFRg_1_Yg\n\nWhy Is Blue So Rare In Nature?\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3g246c6Bv58\n\n\n---+ Follow KQED Science\n\nKQED Science: http://www.kqed.org/science\nTumblr: http://kqedscience.tumblr.com\nTwitter: https://www.twitter.com/kqedscience\n\n---+ About KQED\n\nKQED, an NPR and PBS affiliate in San Francisco, CA, serves Northern California and beyond with a public-supported alternative to commercial TV, Radio and web media.\n\nFunding for Deep Look is provided in part by PBS Digital Studios.

But when it comes to hooking up, male mantises have good reason to fear commitment. \n\nSUBSCRIBE to Deep Look! http://goo.gl/8NwXqt\n\nDEEP LOOK is a ultra-HD (4K) short video series created by KQED San Francisco and presented by PBS Digital Studios.

Explore big scientific mysteries by going incredibly small.\n\n* NEW VIDEOS EVERY OTHER TUESDAY! *\n\nMike Maxwell recently finished a ninth season studying the love life of the praying mantises that live around Bishop, a town in California\u2019s Eastern Sierra.\n\nOver that time, he\u2019s seen some unsettlingly strange behaviors.\n\nIt\u2019s pretty common knowledge that female mantises sometimes eat males during or after mating \u2014 a habit that biologists call \u201csexual cannibalism.\u201d \n\nBut among the bordered mantises that Maxwell researches, it gets weirder than that.\n\nAs it turns out, when a male mantis loses his head, it doesn\u2019t mean he loses the urge to procreate.\n\nYou read that right. Not only can some male bordered mantises continue mating even while being attacked by their female counterparts, some males are able to mount a female and initiate mating even after getting their heads completely bitten off.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a really weird, strange behavior,\u201d said Maxwell, \u201cSo what\u2019s going on? Why do they do it?\u201d\n\n-- What do praying mantises eat?\n\nPraying mantises are mostly ambush predators that typically eat small animals like grasshoppers, crickets, bees, crickets and butterflies . They use camouflage to hide themselves and wait for their prey to come within striking distance. Then they use their raptorial forelimbs to grab their prey. Spikes on their forelimbs help them hold their prey while they eat.\n\n-- Why do praying mantises eat each other?\n\nFemale praying mantises sometimes eat males that approach them to mate. They are only able to do this because mantises are predators and the female mantises are bigger and stronger than the males.\n\n-- Do praying mantises bite?\n\nMost mantises will not bite people but they will pinch people with their forelimbs to defend themselves. It feels a lot like getting bit, trust me.\n\n---+ Read the entire article on KQED Science:\n\nhttps://ww2.kqed.org/science/2017/11/14/praying-mantis-love-is-waaay-weirder-than-you-think-deep-look/\n\n---+ For more information:\n\nDr. Michael Maxwell, National University\nhttps://www.nu.edu/OurPrograms/CollegeOfLettersAndSciences/MathematicsAndNaturalSciences/Faculty/MichelRMaxwell.html\n\n---+ More Great Deep Look episodes:\n\nIt\u2019s a Goopy Mess When Pines and Beetles Duke it Out | Deep Look\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wR5O48zsbnc\n\nThese Whispering, Walking Bats Are Onto Something | Deep Look\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2py029bwhA&t=3s\n\nThere's Something Very Fishy About These Trees ... | Deep Look\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZWiWh5acbE&t=1s\n\n\n---+ See some great videos and documentaries from PBS Digital Studios!\n\nHow Your Rubber Ducky Explains Colonialism | Origin of Everything\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BWjzOcIIxgM\n\nWhen Whales Walked | PBS Eons\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_OSRKtT_9vw\n\nThe Cheerios Effect | It\u2019s OK To Be Smart\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mbKAwk-OG_w\n\n\n---+ Follow KQED Science\n\nKQED Science: http://www.kqed.org/science\nTumblr: http://kqedscience.tumblr.com\nTwitter: https://www.twitter.com/kqedscience\n\n---+ About KQED\n\n\nKQED, an NPR and PBS affiliate in San Francisco, CA, serves Northern California and beyond with a public-supported alternative to commercial TV, Radio and web media.\n\nFunding for Deep Look is provided in part by PBS Digital Studios and the John S. and James L.

Not only can some male bordered mantises continue mating even while being attacked by their female counterparts, some males are able to mount a female and initiate mating even after getting their heads completely bitten off.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a really weird, strange behavior,\u201d said Maxwell, \u201cSo what\u2019s going on? Why do they do it?\u201d\n\n-- What do praying mantises eat?\n\nPraying mantises are mostly ambush predators that typically eat small animals like grasshoppers, crickets, bees, crickets and butterflies . They use camouflage to hide themselves and wait for their prey to come within striking distance. Then they use their raptorial forelimbs to grab their prey. Spikes on their forelimbs help them hold their prey while they eat.\n\n-- Why do praying mantises eat each other?\n\nFemale praying mantises sometimes eat males that approach them to mate. They are only able to do this because mantises are predators and the female mantises are bigger and stronger than the males.\n\n-- Do praying mantises bite?\n\nMost mantises will not bite people but they will pinch people with their forelimbs to defend themselves. It feels a lot like getting bit, trust me.\n\n---+ Read the entire article on KQED Science:\n\nhttps://ww2.kqed.org/science/2017/11/14/praying-mantis-love-is-waaay-weirder-than-you-think-deep-look/\n\n---+ For more information:\n\nDr. Michael Maxwell, National University\nhttps://www.nu.edu/OurPrograms/CollegeOfLettersAndSciences/MathematicsAndNaturalSciences/Faculty/MichelRMaxwell.html\n\n---+ More Great Deep Look episodes:\n\nIt\u2019s a Goopy Mess When Pines and Beetles Duke it Out | Deep Look\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wR5O48zsbnc\n\nThese Whispering, Walking Bats Are Onto Something | Deep Look\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2py029bwhA&t=3s\n\nThere's Something Very Fishy About These Trees ... | Deep Look\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZWiWh5acbE&t=1s\n\n\n---+ See some great videos and documentaries from PBS Digital Studios!\n\nHow Your Rubber Ducky Explains Colonialism | Origin of Everything\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BWjzOcIIxgM\n\nWhen Whales Walked | PBS Eons\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_OSRKtT_9vw\n\nThe Cheerios Effect | It\u2019s OK To Be Smart\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mbKAwk-OG_w\n\n\n---+ Follow KQED Science\n\nKQED Science: http://www.kqed.org/science\nTumblr: http://kqedscience.tumblr.com\nTwitter: https://www.twitter.com/kqedscience\n\n---+ About KQED\n\n\nKQED, an NPR and PBS affiliate in San Francisco, CA, serves Northern California and beyond with a public-supported alternative to commercial TV, Radio and web media.\n\nFunding for Deep Look is provided in part by PBS Digital Studios and the John S. and James L.

Ponderosa pines are attacked by dark brown beetles the size of a grain of rice called western pine beetles (Dendroctonus brevicomis). \n\nIn the spring and summer, female western pine beetles fly around ponderosa pine stands looking for trees to lay their eggs in. As they start boring into a ponderosa, the tree oozes a sticky, viscous clear liquid called resin. If the tree is healthy, it can produce so much resin that the beetle gets exhausted and trapped as the resin hardens, which can kill it. \n\n\u201cThe western pine beetle is an aggressive beetle that in order to successfully reproduce has to kill the tree,\u201d said U.S. Forest Service ecologist Sharon Hood, based in Montana. \u201cSo the tree has very evolved responses. With pines, they have a whole resin duct system. You can imagine these vertical and horizontal pipes.\u201d\n\nBut during California\u2019s five-year drought, which ended earlier this year, ponderosa pines weren\u2019t getting much water and couldn\u2019t make enough resin to put up a strong defense. Beetles bored through the bark of millions of trees and sent out an aggregating pheromone to call more beetles and stage a mass attack. An estimated 102 million trees \u2013 most of them ponderosa \u2013  died in California between 2010 and 2016. \n\n-- What is resin?\n\nResin \u2013 sometimes also called pitch \u2013 is a different substance from sap, though trees produce both. Resin is a sticky, viscous liquid that trees exude to heal over wounds and flush out bark beetles, said Sharon Hood, of the Forest Service. Sap, on the other hand, is the continuous water column that the leaves pull up to the top of the tree from its roots.\n\n--- Are dead trees a fire hazard? \n\nStanding dead trees that have lost their needles don\u2019t increase fire risk, said forest health scientist Jodi Axelson, a University of California extension specialist based at UC Berkeley. But \u201conce they fall to the ground you end up with these very heavy fuel loads,\u201d she said, \u201cand that undoubtedly is going to make fire behavior more intense.\u201d\n\nAnd dead \u2013 or living \u2013 trees can fall on electric lines and ignite a fire, which is why agencies in California are prioritizing the removal of dead trees near power lines, said Axelson. \n\n---+ Read the entire article about who\u2019s winning the battle between ponderosa pines and western pine beetles in California, on KQED Science:\nhttps://ww2.kqed.org/science/2017/10/24/with-california-drought-over-fewer-sierra-pines-dying/\n\n---+ For more information:\nCheck out the USDA\u2019s \u201cBark Beetles in California Conifers \u2013 Are Your Trees Susceptible?\u201d\nhttps://www.fs.usda.gov/Internet/FSE_DOCUMENTS/stelprdb5384837.pdf\n\n---+ More Great Deep Look episodes: \n\nThis Mushroom Starts Killing You Before You Even Realize It\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bl9aCH2QaQY&t=57s\n\nThe Bombardier Beetle And Its Crazy Chemical Cannon\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BWwgLS5tK80\n\nThere\u2019s Something Very Fishy About These Trees \u2026\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZWiWh5acbE\n\n---+ See some great videos and documentaries from PBS Digital Studios!\n\nVascular Plants = Winning! - Crash Course Biology #37\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h9oDTMXM7M8&index=37&list=PL3EED4C1D684D3ADF\n\nJulia Child Remixed | Keep On Cooking\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80ZrUI7RNfI\n\n---+ Follow KQED Science: \nKQED Science: http://www.kqed.org/science \nTumblr: http://kqedscience.tumblr.com \nTwitter: https://www.twitter.com/kqedscience \n\n---+ About KQED\n\nKQED, an NPR and PBS affiliate in San Francisco, CA, serves Northern California and beyond with a public-supported alternative to commercial TV, Radio and web media.\n\nFunding for Deep Look is provided in part by PBS Digital Studios and the John S. and James L.

An estimated 102 million trees \u2013 most of them ponderosa \u2013  died in California between 2010 and 2016. \n\n-- What is resin?\n\nResin \u2013 sometimes also called pitch \u2013 is a different substance from sap, though trees produce both. Resin is a sticky, viscous liquid that trees exude to heal over wounds and flush out bark beetles, said Sharon Hood, of the Forest Service. Sap, on the other hand, is the continuous water column that the leaves pull up to the top of the tree from its roots.\n\n--- Are dead trees a fire hazard? \n\nStanding dead trees that have lost their needles don\u2019t increase fire risk, said forest health scientist Jodi Axelson, a University of California extension specialist based at UC Berkeley. But \u201conce they fall to the ground you end up with these very heavy fuel loads,\u201d she said, \u201cand that undoubtedly is going to make fire behavior more intense.\u201d\n\nAnd dead \u2013 or living \u2013 trees can fall on electric lines and ignite a fire, which is why agencies in California are prioritizing the removal of dead trees near power lines, said Axelson. \n\n---+ Read the entire article about who\u2019s winning the battle between ponderosa pines and western pine beetles in California, on KQED Science:\nhttps://ww2.kqed.org/science/2017/10/24/with-california-drought-over-fewer-sierra-pines-dying/\n\n---+ For more information:\nCheck out the USDA\u2019s \u201cBark Beetles in California Conifers \u2013 Are Your Trees Susceptible?\u201d\nhttps://www.fs.usda.gov/Internet/FSE_DOCUMENTS/stelprdb5384837.pdf\n\n---+ More Great Deep Look episodes: \n\nThis Mushroom Starts Killing You Before You Even Realize It\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bl9aCH2QaQY&t=57s\n\nThe Bombardier Beetle And Its Crazy Chemical Cannon\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BWwgLS5tK80\n\nThere\u2019s Something Very Fishy About These Trees \u2026\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZWiWh5acbE\n\n---+ See some great videos and documentaries from PBS Digital Studios!\n\nVascular Plants = Winning! - Crash Course Biology #37\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h9oDTMXM7M8&index=37&list=PL3EED4C1D684D3ADF\n\nJulia Child Remixed | Keep On Cooking\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80ZrUI7RNfI\n\n---+ Follow KQED Science: \nKQED Science: http://www.kqed.org/science \nTumblr: http://kqedscience.tumblr.com \nTwitter: https://www.twitter.com/kqedscience \n\n---+ About KQED\n\nKQED, an NPR and PBS affiliate in San Francisco, CA, serves Northern California and beyond with a public-supported alternative to commercial TV, Radio and web media.\n\nFunding for Deep Look is provided in part by PBS Digital Studios and the John S. and James L.

All along the Pacific coast, starting in the early summer and stretching as late as December, salmon wait offshore for the right timing to complete their journey inland.\n\nIn Alaska, the season starts in late June, when salmon head to streams in lush coastal forests. Although this annual migration is welcomed by fishermen who catch the salmon offshore, scientists are finding a much broader and holistic function of the spawning salmon: feeding the forest.\n\nMillions of salmon make this migratory journey -- called running -- every year, and their silvery bodies all but obscure the rivers they pass through. This throng of salmon flesh coming into Alaska\u2019s forests is a mass movement of nutrients from the salt waters of the ocean to the forest floor. Decomposing salmon on the sides of streams not only fertilize the soil beneath them, they also provide the base of a complex food web that depends upon them.\n\n\n--- Why Do Salmon Swim Upstream?\nSalmon run up freshwater streams and rivers to mate. A female salmon will dig a depression in the gravel with her tails and then deposit her eggs in the hole. Male salmon swim alongside the female and release a cloud of sperm at the same. The eggs are fertilized in the running water as the female buries them under a layer of gravel.\n\nWhen the eggs hatch, they spend the first part of their lives hunting and growing in their home stream before heading out to sea to spend their adulthood.\n\n--- Why Do Salmon Die After Mating?\nSalmon typically mate once and then die, though some may return to the sea and come back to mate the subsequent year. Salmon put all of their energy into mating instead of maintaining the salmon\u2019s body for the future. This is a type of mating strategy where adults die after a single mating episode is called semelparity. \n\n---+ Read the entire article on KQED Science:\nhttps://ww2.kqed.org/science/2017/09/26/theres-something-fishy-about-these-trees-deep-look/\n\n---+ For more information:\nBob Armstrong\u2019s Nature Alaska\nhttp://www.naturebob.com/\n\n---+ More Great Deep Look episodes:\n\nThese Fish Are All About Sex on the Beach | Deep Look\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5F3z1iP0Ic&list=PLdKlciEDdCQDxBs0SZgTMqhszst1jqZhp&index=3\n\nDecorator Crabs Make High Fashion at Low Tide | Deep Look\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwQcv7TyX04\n\nDaddy Longlegs Risk Life ... and Especially Limb ... to Survive | Deep Look\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tjDmH8zhp6o\n\n---+ See some great videos and documentaries from the PBS Digital Studios!\n\nBeavers: The Smartest Thing in Fur Pants | It\u2019s Okay To Be Smart\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zm6X77ShHa8\n\nHow Do Glaciers Move? | It\u2019s Okay To Be Smart\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RnlPrdMoQ1Y&t=165s\n\nThe Smell of Durian Explained | Reactions (ft.

All along the Pacific coast, starting in the early summer and stretching as late as December, salmon wait offshore for the right timing to complete their journey inland.\n\nIn Alaska, the season starts in late June, when salmon head to streams in lush coastal forests. Although this annual migration is welcomed by fishermen who catch the salmon offshore, scientists are finding a much broader and holistic function of the spawning salmon: feeding the forest.\n\nMillions of salmon make this migratory journey -- called running -- every year, and their silvery bodies all but obscure the rivers they pass through. This throng of salmon flesh coming into Alaska\u2019s forests is a mass movement of nutrients from the salt waters of the ocean to the forest floor. Decomposing salmon on the sides of streams not only fertilize the soil beneath them, they also provide the base of a complex food web that depends upon them.\n\n\n--- Why Do Salmon Swim Upstream?\nSalmon run up freshwater streams and rivers to mate. A female salmon will dig a depression in the gravel with her tails and then deposit her eggs in the hole. Male salmon swim alongside the female and release a cloud of sperm at the same. The eggs are fertilized in the running water as the female buries them under a layer of gravel.\n\nWhen the eggs hatch, they spend the first part of their lives hunting and growing in their home stream before heading out to sea to spend their adulthood.\n\n--- Why Do Salmon Die After Mating?\nSalmon typically mate once and then die, though some may return to the sea and come back to mate the subsequent year. Salmon put all of their energy into mating instead of maintaining the salmon\u2019s body for the future. This is a type of mating strategy where adults die after a single mating episode is called semelparity. \n\n---+ Read the entire article on KQED Science:\nhttps://ww2.kqed.org/science/2017/09/26/theres-something-fishy-about-these-trees-deep-look/\n\n---+ For more information:\nBob Armstrong\u2019s Nature Alaska\nhttp://www.naturebob.com/\n\n---+ More Great Deep Look episodes:\n\nThese Fish Are All About Sex on the Beach | Deep Look\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5F3z1iP0Ic&list=PLdKlciEDdCQDxBs0SZgTMqhszst1jqZhp&index=3\n\nDecorator Crabs Make High Fashion at Low Tide | Deep Look\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwQcv7TyX04\n\nDaddy Longlegs Risk Life ... and Especially Limb ... to Survive | Deep Look\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tjDmH8zhp6o\n\n---+ See some great videos and documentaries from the PBS Digital Studios!\n\nBeavers: The Smartest Thing in Fur Pants | It\u2019s Okay To Be Smart\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zm6X77ShHa8\n\nHow Do Glaciers Move? | It\u2019s Okay To Be Smart\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RnlPrdMoQ1Y&t=165s\n\nThe Smell of Durian Explained | Reactions (ft.

                "description": "Dragonflies might rule the skies, but their babies grow up underwater in a larva-eat-larva world.  Luckily for them, they have a killer lip that snatches prey, Alien-style, at lightning speed.\n\nSUBSCRIBE to Deep Look! http://goo.gl/8NwXqt\n\nDEEP LOOK: a new ultra-HD (4K) short video series created by KQED San Francisco and presented by PBS Digital Studios.

Explore big scientific mysteries by going incredibly small.\n\n* NEW VIDEOS EVERY OTHER TUESDAY! *\n\nIf adult dragonflies are known to be precise hunters, capable of turning on a dime and using their almost-360-degree vision to nab mosquitoes and flies in midair, their dragon-looking babies are even more fearsome. \n\nDragonflies and damselflies lay their eggs in water. After they hatch, their larvae, also known as nymphs, spend months or years underwater growing wings on their backs. \n\nWithout those versatile four wings that adults use to chase down prey, nymphs rely on a mouthpart they shoot out. It\u2019s like a long, hinged arm that they keep folded under their head and it\u2019s eerily similar to the snapping tongue-like protuberance the alien shoots out at Ripley in the sci-fi movie Aliens. \n\nA nymph\u2019s eyesight is almost as precise as an adult dragonfly\u2019s and when they spot something they want to eat, they extrude this mouthpart, called a labium, to engulf, grab, or impale their next meal and draw it back to their mouth. Only dragonfly and damselfly nymphs have this special mouthpart.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s like a built-in spear gun,\u201d said Kathy Biggs, the author of guides to the dragonflies of California and the greater Southwest. \n\nWith their labium, nymphs can catch mosquito larvae, worms and even small fish and tadpoles.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s obviously an adaptation to be a predator underwater, where it\u2019s not easy to trap things,\u201d said Dennis Paulson, a dragonfly biologist retired from the University of Puget Sound. \n\nAlso known among biologists as a \u201ckiller lip,\u201d the labium comes in two versions. There\u2019s the spork-shaped labium that scoops up prey, and a flat one with a pair of pincers on the end that can grab or impale aquatic insects. \n\n-- How many years have dragonflies been around?\n\nDragonflies have been around for 320 million years, said Ed Jarzembowski, who studies fossil dragonflies at the Nanjing Institute of Geology and Paleontology. That means they were here before the dinosaurs.\n\n-- How big did dragonflies used to be?\n\nPrehistoric dragonflies had a wingspan of 0.7 meters (almost 28 inches). That\u2019s the wingspan of a small hawk today.\n\n---+ Read the entire article on KQED Science:\n\nhttps://ww2.kqed.org/science/2017/09/12/a-baby-dragonflys-mouth-will-give-you-nightmares/\n\n---+ For more information:\n\nThis web site, run by Kathy and David Biggs, has photos and descriptions of California dragonflies and damselflies and information on building a pond to attract the insects to your backyard: http://bigsnest.members.sonic.net/Pond/dragons/\n\nThe book \"A Dazzle of Dragonflies,\" by Forrest Mitchell and James Lasswell, has good information on dragonfly nymphs.\n\n---+ More great Deep Look episodes:\n\nWhy Is The Very Hungry Caterpillar So Dang Hungry?\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=el_lPd2oFV4\n\nThis Mushroom Starts Killing You Before You Even Realize It\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bl9aCH2QaQY&t=57s\n\nDaddy Longlegs Risk Life ... and Especially Limb ... to Survive\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tjDmH8zhp6o\n\nThis Is Why Water Striders Make Terrible Lifeguards\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E2unnSK7WTE\n\n---+ See some great videos and documentaries from PBS Digital Studios!\n\nPBS Eons: The Biggest Thing That Ever Flew\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scAp-fncp64\n\nPBS Infinite Series: A Breakthrough in Higher Dimensional Spheres\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ciM6wigZK0w\n\n---+ Follow KQED Science:\n\nKQED Science: http://www.kqed.org/science\nTumblr: http://kqedscience.tumblr.com\nTwitter: https://www.twitter.com/kqedscience\n\n---+ About KQED \n\nKQED, an NPR and PBS affiliate based in San Francisco, serves the people of Northern California and beyond with a public-supported alternative to commercial media.

                    "description": "Dragonflies might rule the skies, but their babies grow up underwater in a larva-eat-larva world.  Luckily for them, they have a killer lip that snatches prey, Alien-style, at lightning speed.\n\nSUBSCRIBE to Deep Look! http://goo.gl/8NwXqt\n\nDEEP LOOK: a new ultra-HD (4K) short video series created by KQED San Francisco and presented by PBS Digital Studios.

Explore big scientific mysteries by going incredibly small.\n\n* NEW VIDEOS EVERY OTHER TUESDAY! *\n\nIf adult dragonflies are known to be precise hunters, capable of turning on a dime and using their almost-360-degree vision to nab mosquitoes and flies in midair, their dragon-looking babies are even more fearsome. \n\nDragonflies and damselflies lay their eggs in water. After they hatch, their larvae, also known as nymphs, spend months or years underwater growing wings on their backs. \n\nWithout those versatile four wings that adults use to chase down prey, nymphs rely on a mouthpart they shoot out. It\u2019s like a long, hinged arm that they keep folded under their head and it\u2019s eerily similar to the snapping tongue-like protuberance the alien shoots out at Ripley in the sci-fi movie Aliens. \n\nA nymph\u2019s eyesight is almost as precise as an adult dragonfly\u2019s and when they spot something they want to eat, they extrude this mouthpart, called a labium, to engulf, grab, or impale their next meal and draw it back to their mouth. Only dragonfly and damselfly nymphs have this special mouthpart.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s like a built-in spear gun,\u201d said Kathy Biggs, the author of guides to the dragonflies of California and the greater Southwest. \n\nWith their labium, nymphs can catch mosquito larvae, worms and even small fish and tadpoles.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s obviously an adaptation to be a predator underwater, where it\u2019s not easy to trap things,\u201d said Dennis Paulson, a dragonfly biologist retired from the University of Puget Sound. \n\nAlso known among biologists as a \u201ckiller lip,\u201d the labium comes in two versions. There\u2019s the spork-shaped labium that scoops up prey, and a flat one with a pair of pincers on the end that can grab or impale aquatic insects. \n\n-- How many years have dragonflies been around?\n\nDragonflies have been around for 320 million years, said Ed Jarzembowski, who studies fossil dragonflies at the Nanjing Institute of Geology and Paleontology. That means they were here before the dinosaurs.\n\n-- How big did dragonflies used to be?\n\nPrehistoric dragonflies had a wingspan of 0.7 meters (almost 28 inches). That\u2019s the wingspan of a small hawk today.\n\n---+ Read the entire article on KQED Science:\n\nhttps://ww2.kqed.org/science/2017/09/12/a-baby-dragonflys-mouth-will-give-you-nightmares/\n\n---+ For more information:\n\nThis web site, run by Kathy and David Biggs, has photos and descriptions of California dragonflies and damselflies and information on building a pond to attract the insects to your backyard: http://bigsnest.members.sonic.net/Pond/dragons/\n\nThe book \"A Dazzle of Dragonflies,\" by Forrest Mitchell and James Lasswell, has good information on dragonfly nymphs.\n\n---+ More great Deep Look episodes:\n\nWhy Is The Very Hungry Caterpillar So Dang Hungry?\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=el_lPd2oFV4\n\nThis Mushroom Starts Killing You Before You Even Realize It\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bl9aCH2QaQY&t=57s\n\nDaddy Longlegs Risk Life ... and Especially Limb ... to Survive\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tjDmH8zhp6o\n\nThis Is Why Water Striders Make Terrible Lifeguards\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E2unnSK7WTE\n\n---+ See some great videos and documentaries from PBS Digital Studios!\n\nPBS Eons: The Biggest Thing That Ever Flew\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scAp-fncp64\n\nPBS Infinite Series: A Breakthrough in Higher Dimensional Spheres\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ciM6wigZK0w\n\n---+ Follow KQED Science:\n\nKQED Science: http://www.kqed.org/science\nTumblr: http://kqedscience.tumblr.com\nTwitter: https://www.twitter.com/kqedscience\n\n---+ About KQED \n\nKQED, an NPR and PBS affiliate based in San Francisco, serves the people of Northern California and beyond with a public-supported alternative to commercial media.

For many, that means a day on the river or relaxing by the lake. The wet winter means there\u2019s plenty of habitat for one of nature\u2019s most curious creatures.\n\nWater striders, also called pond skaters, seem to defy gravity. You\u2019ve probably seen them flitting across the water\u2019s surface, dodging ripples as they patrol streams and quiet backwater eddies. \n\nScientists like David Hu at Georgia Institute of Technology study how water striders move and how they make their living as predators lurking on the water\u2019s surface. It\u2019s an amazing combination of biology and physics best understood by looking up close. Very close.\n\n--- What are water striders?\nThe common water strider (Gerris lacustris) is an insect typically found in slowly moving freshwater streams and ponds. They are able to move on the water's surface without sinking. They are easy to spot because they create circular waves on the surface of the water.\n\n--- How do water striders walk on water?\nWater tends to stick to itself (cohesion), especially at the surface where it meets the air (surface tension). Water striders don\u2019t weigh very much and they spread their weight out with their long legs. Striders are also covered in microscopic hairs called micro-setae that repel water. Instead of sinking into the water, their legs push down and create dimples.\n\n--- What do water striders eat?\nWater striders are predators and scavengers. They use their ability to walk on water to their advantage, primarily eating other insects that fall into the water at get trapped by the surface tension. A water strider uses its tube-shaped proboscis to penetrate their prey\u2019s exoskeleton, inject digestive enzymes and suck out the prey\u2019s pre-digested innards.\n\n---+ Read the entire article on KQED Science:\nhttps://ww2.kqed.org/science/2017/08/01/this-is-why-water-striders-make-terrible-lifeguards/\n\n---+ For more information:\nhttp://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v424/n6949/abs/nature01793.html?foxtrotcallback=true\n\n---+ More Great Deep Look episodes:\nThese Fish Are All About Sex on the Beach | Deep Look\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5F3z1iP0Ic&list=PLdKlciEDdCQDxBs0SZgTMqhszst1jqZhp&index=3\n\nHow Do Pelicans Survive Their Death-Defying Dives? | Deep Look\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BfEboMmwAMw\n\nDecorator Crabs Make High Fashion at Low Tide | Deep Look\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwQcv7TyX04\n\nWhy Is The Very Hungry Caterpillar So Dang Hungry? | Deep Look\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=el_lPd2oFV4&list=PLdKlciEDdCQDxBs0SZgTMqhszst1jqZhp\n\n---+ See some great videos and documentaries from the PBS Digital Studios!\n\nBeavers: The Smartest Thing in Fur Pants | It\u2019s Okay To Be Smart\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zm6X77ShHa8\n\nCan Genetically Engineered Mosquitoes Help Fight Disease? | Above The Noise\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CB_h7aheAEM\n\nHow Do Glaciers Move? | It\u2019s Okay To Be Smart\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RnlPrdMoQ1Y\n\nYour Biological Clock at Work | BrainCraft\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Q8djfQlYwQ\n\n---+ Follow KQED Science:\nKQED Science: http://www.kqed.org/science\nTumblr: http://kqedscience.tumblr.com\nTwitter: https://www.twitter.com/kqedscience\n\n---+ About KQED\nKQED, an NPR and PBS affiliate based in San Francisco, serves the people of Northern California and beyond with a public-supported alternative to commercial media.

Not just for itself, but for the butterfly it will become and every egg that butterfly will lay. And it's about to lose its mouth... as it wriggles out of its skin during metamorphosis.\n\nDEEP LOOK is a ultra-HD (4K) short video series created by KQED San Francisco and presented by PBS Digital Studios.

Most of the protein that goes to making eggs has to come from larval feeding.\u201d\n\nCaterpillars are the larval stage of a butterfly. Their complete transformation to pupa and then to butterfly is a strategy called holometaboly. Humans are in the minority among animals in that we don\u2019t go through these very distinct, almost separate, lives. We start out as a smaller version of ourselves and grow bigger. \n\nBut from an evolutionary point of view, the way butterflies transform make sense. \n\n\u201cYou have a larva that is an eating machine,\u201d said Boggs. \u201cIt\u2019s very well-suited to that. Then you\u2019re turning it into a reproduction machine, the butterfly.\u201d\n\nOnce it becomes a butterfly it will lose its mouth, grow a straw in its place and go on a liquid diet of sugary nectar and rotten fruit juices. Its main job will be to mate and lay eggs. Those eggs started to develop while it was a pupa, using protein that the caterpillar stored by gorging on leaves. We think of leaves as carbohydrates, but the nitrogen they contain makes them more than one quarter protein, said Boggs.\n\n-- What are the stages of a butterfly?\nInsects such as butterflies undergo a complete transformation, referred to by scientists as holometaboly. A holometabolous insect has a morphology in the juvenile state which is different from that in the adult and which undergoes a period of reorganization between the two, said Boggs. The four life stages are egg, larva (caterpillar), pupa (also known as chrysalis) and butterfly.\n\n-- What if humans developed like butterflies?\n\u201cWe\u2019d go into a quiescent period when we developed different kind of eating organs and sensory organs,\u201d said Boggs. \u201cIt would be as if we went into a pupa and developed straws as mouths and developed more elaborate morphology for smelling and developed wings. It brings up science fiction images.\u201d\n\n---+ Read the entire article on KQED Science:\nhttps://ww2.kqed.org/science/2017/07/11/why-is-the-very-hungry-caterpillar-so-dang-hungry/\n\n---+ For more information:\n\nMonarch Watch: http://www.monarchwatch.org\n\nCalifornia Pipevine Swallowtail Project: \nhttps://www.facebook.com/CaliforniaPipevineSwallowtail/\nA forum organized by Tim Wong, who cares for the butterflies in the California Academy of Sciences\u2019 rainforest exhibit.

Not just for itself, but for the butterfly it will become and every egg that butterfly will lay. And it's about to lose its mouth... as it wriggles out of its skin during metamorphosis.\n\nDEEP LOOK is a ultra-HD (4K) short video series created by KQED San Francisco and presented by PBS Digital Studios.

Most of the protein that goes to making eggs has to come from larval feeding.\u201d\n\nCaterpillars are the larval stage of a butterfly. Their complete transformation to pupa and then to butterfly is a strategy called holometaboly. Humans are in the minority among animals in that we don\u2019t go through these very distinct, almost separate, lives. We start out as a smaller version of ourselves and grow bigger. \n\nBut from an evolutionary point of view, the way butterflies transform make sense. \n\n\u201cYou have a larva that is an eating machine,\u201d said Boggs. \u201cIt\u2019s very well-suited to that. Then you\u2019re turning it into a reproduction machine, the butterfly.\u201d\n\nOnce it becomes a butterfly it will lose its mouth, grow a straw in its place and go on a liquid diet of sugary nectar and rotten fruit juices. Its main job will be to mate and lay eggs. Those eggs started to develop while it was a pupa, using protein that the caterpillar stored by gorging on leaves. We think of leaves as carbohydrates, but the nitrogen they contain makes them more than one quarter protein, said Boggs.\n\n-- What are the stages of a butterfly?\nInsects such as butterflies undergo a complete transformation, referred to by scientists as holometaboly. A holometabolous insect has a morphology in the juvenile state which is different from that in the adult and which undergoes a period of reorganization between the two, said Boggs. The four life stages are egg, larva (caterpillar), pupa (also known as chrysalis) and butterfly.\n\n-- What if humans developed like butterflies?\n\u201cWe\u2019d go into a quiescent period when we developed different kind of eating organs and sensory organs,\u201d said Boggs. \u201cIt would be as if we went into a pupa and developed straws as mouths and developed more elaborate morphology for smelling and developed wings. It brings up science fiction images.\u201d\n\n---+ Read the entire article on KQED Science:\nhttps://ww2.kqed.org/science/2017/07/11/why-is-the-very-hungry-caterpillar-so-dang-hungry/\n\n---+ For more information:\n\nMonarch Watch: http://www.monarchwatch.org\n\nCalifornia Pipevine Swallowtail Project: \nhttps://www.facebook.com/CaliforniaPipevineSwallowtail/\nA forum organized by Tim Wong, who cares for the butterflies in the California Academy of Sciences\u2019 rainforest exhibit.

There are also smaller populations in Monterey Bay and San Francisco Bay. Another species, the Gulf Grunion lays their eggs in the northern shores of the Gulf of California. California Grunion are typically about six inches in length.\n \n--- Why do grunion mate on land?\nThe ocean is full of predators who would like to gobble up a tasty fish egg. The grunion eggs tend to be safer up on the beach if they can make it there without raising the attention of predators like birds and raccoons. Grunion eggs have a tough outer layer that keeps them from drying out or being crushed by the sand. \n \n--- When do California grunion run?\nCalifornia grunion typically spawn from March to August. The fishing season is closed during the peak spawning times during May and June.

Nowhere is this truer than in the animal kingdom. One minute you\u2019re a crab minding your own business in a tide pool, and the next, you\u2019re a seagull\u2019s snack.\n\nUnless you\u2019re a decorator crab, that is, and you use this season\u2019s seaweed to save your life.\n \nThere are nearly 700 species of decorator crabs around the world \u2013 about a dozen of them in California, where they live in tide pools and kelp forests. They camouflage by decorating their heads, or their entire bodies depending on the species, with pieces of seaweed, anemones or other materials around them, which they attach securely to a natural Velcro that grows right on their bodies.\n \n\u201cIt\u2019s not a glue or anything; they have these hooked hairs all over their shells,\u201d said biologist Jay Stachowicz, who studies decorator crabs at the University of California, Davis. \u201cThrough microscope photography we can see that it looks just like Velcro, except probably even better, even more hooked.\u201d\n\nThese golden-colored hairs are thick and curled to form long rows. Some species of decorator crabs have these rows of hooked hairs only on their heads; others, on their entire bodies. \n\nAt his lab at UC Davis\u2019 Bodega Marine Lab in Bodega Bay, Stachowicz collects crabs off the coast, places them in tanks, gives them some seaweed and watches them go to work. \n\nThe process is more exciting than watching Project Runway contestants create their confections, if you consider that the crabs are making it work with much more simple tools than the designers.  And the stakes are much higher.\n\n--- How does a decorator crab camouflage?\nA pink Cryptic kelp crab, for example, cuts a piece of purple seaweed with one of its claws. \n\nThen the crab holds the piece of seaweed above its head, the only part of its body where it has hooked hairs. It moves the piece of seaweed back and forth, until it\u2019s tightly wedged inside the hooks. Then it repeats the process. The result is a \u201chat\u201d of bushy seaweed that protrudes beyond its head. \n\nWith the seaweed, the crab is concealing two of its four antennae, short protuberances near its mouth. These antennae are constantly aflutter. The crab uses them to smell, and they could call the attention of predators even when the crab remains still. By hiding the movement of the antennae, the seaweed visor protects the crab from birds pecking around in the tide pools and aquatic predators like fish and octopuses. \n\n--- What is Tim Gunn\u2019s most famous quote?\nThe beloved advisor to contestants of Project Runway has many memorable phrases.

                "description": "We've all heard that each and every snowflake is unique. But in a lab in sunny southern California, a physicist has learned to control the way snowflakes grow. Can he really make twins? \n\nSUBSCRIBE to Deep Look! http://goo.gl/8NwXqt\n\nDEEP LOOK is a ultra-HD (4K) short video series created by KQED San Francisco and presented by PBS Digital Studios.

Explore big scientific mysteries by going incredibly small.\n\n* NEW VIDEOS EVERY OTHER TUESDAY! *\n\nCalifornia's historic drought is finally over thanks largely to a relentless parade of  powerful storms that have brought the Sierra Nevada snowpack to the highest level in six years, and guaranteed skiing into June. All that snow spurs an age-old question -- is every snowflake really unique?\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s one of these questions that\u2019s been around forever,\u201d said Ken Libbrecht, a professor of physics at the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena. \u201cI think we all learn it in elementary school, the old saying that no two snowflakes are alike.\u201d\n\n--- How do snowflakes form?\nSnow crystals form when humid air is cooled to the point that molecules of water vapor start sticking to each other. In the clouds, crystals usually start forming around a tiny microscopic dust particle, but if the water vapor gets cooled quickly enough the crystals can form spontaneously out of water molecules alone. Over time, more water molecules stick to the crystal until it gets heavy enough to fall.\n\n--- Why do snowflakes have six arms?\nEach water molecule is each made out of one oxygen atom and two hydrogen atoms. As vapor, the water molecules bounce around slamming into each other. As the vapor cools, the hydrogen atom of one molecule forms a bond with the oxygen of another water molecule. This is called a hydrogen bond. These bonds make the water molecules stick together in the shape of a hexagonal ring. As the crystal grows, more molecules join fitting within that same repeating pattern called a crystal array. The crystal keeps the hexagonal symmetry as it grows.\n\n--- Is every snowflake unique?\nSnowflakes develop into different shapes depending on the humidity and temperature conditions they experience at different times during their growth. In nature, snowflakes don\u2019t travel together. Instead, each takes it\u2019s own path through the clouds experiencing different conditions at different times. Since each crystal takes a different path, they each turn out slightly differently. Growing snow crystals in laboratory is a whole other story. \n\n---+ Read the entire article on KQED Science:\nhttps://ww2.kqed.org/science/2017/04/11/identical-snowflakes-scientist-ruins-winter-for-everyone-deep-look/\n\n---+ For more information:\n\nKen Libbrecht\u2019s online guide to snowflakes, snow crystals and other ice phenomena.\nhttp://snowcrystals.com/\n\n---+ More Great Deep Look episodes:\nCan A Thousand Tiny Swarming Robots Outsmart Nature? | Deep Look\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dDsmbwOrHJs\nWhat Gives the Morpho Butterfly Its Magnificent Blue? | Deep Look\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=29Ts7CsJDpg&list=PLdKlciEDdCQDxBs0SZgTMqhszst1jqZhp&index=48\nThe Amazing Life of Sand | Deep Look\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VkrQ9QuKprE&list=PLdKlciEDdCQDxBs0SZgTMqhszst1jqZhp&index=51\nThe Hidden Perils of Permafrost | Deep Look\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wxABO84gol8\n\n---+ See some great videos and documentaries from the PBS Digital Studios!\nThe Science of Snowflakes | It\u2019s OK to be Smart\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUot7XSX8uA\nAn Infinite Number of Words for Snow | PBS Idea Channel\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX6i2M4AoZw\nIs an Ice Age Coming? | Space Time | PBS Digital Studios\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztninkgZ0ws\n\n---+ Follow KQED Science:\n\nKQED Science: http://www.kqed.org/science\nTumblr: http://kqedscience.tumblr.com\nTwitter: https://www.twitter.com/kqedscience\n\n---+ About KQED\n\nKQED, an NPR and PBS affiliate in San Francisco, CA, serves Northern California and beyond with a public-supported alternative to commercial TV, Radio and web media.\n\nFunding for Deep Look is provided in part by PBS Digital Studios and the John S. and James L.

All that snow spurs an age-old question -- is every snowflake really unique?\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s one of these questions that\u2019s been around forever,\u201d said Ken Libbrecht, a professor of physics at the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena. \u201cI think we all learn it in elementary school, the old saying that no two snowflakes are alike.\u201d\n\n--- How do snowflakes form?\nSnow crystals form when humid air is cooled to the point that molecules of water vapor start sticking to each other. In the clouds, crystals usually start forming around a tiny microscopic dust particle, but if the water vapor gets cooled quickly enough the crystals can form spontaneously out of water molecules alone. Over time, more water molecules stick to the crystal until it gets heavy enough to fall.\n\n--- Why do snowflakes have six arms?\nEach water molecule is each made out of one oxygen atom and two hydrogen atoms. As vapor, the water molecules bounce around slamming into each other. As the vapor cools, the hydrogen atom of one molecule forms a bond with the oxygen of another water molecule. This is called a hydrogen bond. These bonds make the water molecules stick together in the shape of a hexagonal ring. As the crystal grows, more molecules join fitting within that same repeating pattern called a crystal array. The crystal keeps the hexagonal symmetry as it grows.\n\n--- Is every snowflake unique?\nSnowflakes develop into different shapes depending on the humidity and temperature conditions they experience at different times during their growth. In nature, snowflakes don\u2019t travel together. Instead, each takes it\u2019s own path through the clouds experiencing different conditions at different times. Since each crystal takes a different path, they each turn out slightly differently. Growing snow crystals in laboratory is a whole other story. \n\n---+ Read the entire article on KQED Science:\nhttps://ww2.kqed.org/science/2017/04/11/identical-snowflakes-scientist-ruins-winter-for-everyone-deep-look/\n\n---+ For more information:\n\nKen Libbrecht\u2019s online guide to snowflakes, snow crystals and other ice phenomena.\nhttp://snowcrystals.com/\n\n---+ More Great Deep Look episodes:\nCan A Thousand Tiny Swarming Robots Outsmart Nature? | Deep Look\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dDsmbwOrHJs\nWhat Gives the Morpho Butterfly Its Magnificent Blue? | Deep Look\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=29Ts7CsJDpg&list=PLdKlciEDdCQDxBs0SZgTMqhszst1jqZhp&index=48\nThe Amazing Life of Sand | Deep Look\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VkrQ9QuKprE&list=PLdKlciEDdCQDxBs0SZgTMqhszst1jqZhp&index=51\nThe Hidden Perils of Permafrost | Deep Look\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wxABO84gol8\n\n---+ See some great videos and documentaries from the PBS Digital Studios!\nThe Science of Snowflakes | It\u2019s OK to be Smart\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUot7XSX8uA\nAn Infinite Number of Words for Snow | PBS Idea Channel\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX6i2M4AoZw\nIs an Ice Age Coming? | Space Time | PBS Digital Studios\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztninkgZ0ws\n\n---+ Follow KQED Science:\n\nKQED Science: http://www.kqed.org/science\nTumblr: http://kqedscience.tumblr.com\nTwitter: https://www.twitter.com/kqedscience\n\n---+ About KQED\n\nKQED, an NPR and PBS affiliate in San Francisco, CA, serves Northern California and beyond with a public-supported alternative to commercial TV, Radio and web media.\n\nFunding for Deep Look is provided in part by PBS Digital Studios and the John S. and James L.

                "description": "It's not vanity. For cats, staying clean is a matter of life and death. And their tongue, specially equipped for the job, is just one of the things that makes cats such successful predators.\n\nSUBSCRIBE to Deep Look! http://goo.gl/8NwXqt\n\nDEEP LOOK is a ultra-HD (4K) short video series created by KQED San Francisco and presented by PBS Digital Studios. See the unseen at the very edge of our visible world. Get a new perspective on our place in the universe. Explore big scientific mysteries by going incredibly small.\n\n* NEW VIDEOS EVERY OTHER TUESDAY! *\n\nEven after thousands of years sharing our homes, cats still remain mysterious. For one thing, they spend an inordinate amount of time grooming themselves, up to half of their waking hours.\n\nBut all of that primping isn\u2019t about vanity. For ambush predators like cats, staying clean is a matter of life and death.\n\nIn this episode of Deep Look we get up close and personal with these fastidious felines. By looking closely at cat tongues, research at MIT and Georgia Tech reveals clues to cats\u2019 predatory prowess and finds inspiration for new technologies.\n\n--- Why do cat\u2019s tongues feel like sandpaper?\nCats\u2019 tongues are covered in little spines called \u201cpapillae\u201d that look like tiny hooks. Cats use their tongues to groom and the spines do a great job of detangling knots.\n\n--- Why do cats spend so much time grooming?\nCat\u2019s spend much of their day cleaning themselves- up to half of their waking hours! Cats are ambush predators and they need to stay clean in order to remain hidden from their prey. Prey species tend to be on the lookout for danger, and one whiff of the wrong odor can give the cat away. \n\n--- Why do cats drink with their tongues?\nLike most other mammals that are predators, cats have wide mouths to help them sink their teeth deep into their prey. The large opening on the sides of their mouth helps them get a better bite, but it makes it hard for them to create suction in order to drink. Instead they use their tongue to draw water up from the surface into a column. They then bite the column to get the water. They usually lap about four times per second.\n\n---+ Read the entire article on KQED Science: \nhttps://ww2.kqed.org/science/2017/02/28/why-does-your-cats-tongue-feel-like-sandpaper/\n\n---+ For more information:\nHow Cats Lap: Water Uptake by Felis catus\nhttp://science.sciencemag.org/content/330/6008/1231\n\n---+ More Great Deep Look episodes:\n\nIf Your Hands Could Smell, You\u2019d Be an Octopus | Deep Look\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XXMxihOh8ps\n\nArcherfish Says...\"I Spit in Your Face!\" | Deep Look\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gN81dtxilhE\n\nRoly Polies Came From the Sea to Conquer the Earth | Deep Look\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sj8pFX9SOXE\n\n\n---+ See some great videos and documentaries from the PBS Digital Studios!\n\nPigeon Story: How the Rock Dove Became the Sky Rat | It\u2019s OK to be Smart\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8Y7Q1eja-E\n\nEverything is Trying to Kill You\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LB8SqTwT93E\n\n---+ Follow KQED Science:\n\nKQED Science: http://www.kqed.org/science\nTumblr: http://kqedscience.tumblr.com\nTwitter: https://www.twitter.com/kqedscience\n\n---+ About KQED\n\nKQED, an NPR and PBS affiliate in San Francisco, CA, serves Northern California and beyond with a public-supported alternative to commercial TV, Radio and web media.\n\nFunding for Deep Look is provided in part by PBS Digital Studios and the John S. and James L.

For one thing, they spend an inordinate amount of time grooming themselves, up to half of their waking hours.\n\nBut all of that primping isn\u2019t about vanity. For ambush predators like cats, staying clean is a matter of life and death.\n\nIn this episode of Deep Look we get up close and personal with these fastidious felines. By looking closely at cat tongues, research at MIT and Georgia Tech reveals clues to cats\u2019 predatory prowess and finds inspiration for new technologies.\n\n--- Why do cat\u2019s tongues feel like sandpaper?\nCats\u2019 tongues are covered in little spines called \u201cpapillae\u201d that look like tiny hooks. Cats use their tongues to groom and the spines do a great job of detangling knots.\n\n--- Why do cats spend so much time grooming?\nCat\u2019s spend much of their day cleaning themselves- up to half of their waking hours! Cats are ambush predators and they need to stay clean in order to remain hidden from their prey. Prey species tend to be on the lookout for danger, and one whiff of the wrong odor can give the cat away. \n\n--- Why do cats drink with their tongues?\nLike most other mammals that are predators, cats have wide mouths to help them sink their teeth deep into their prey. The large opening on the sides of their mouth helps them get a better bite, but it makes it hard for them to create suction in order to drink. Instead they use their tongue to draw water up from the surface into a column. They then bite the column to get the water. They usually lap about four times per second.\n\n---+ Read the entire article on KQED Science: \nhttps://ww2.kqed.org/science/2017/02/28/why-does-your-cats-tongue-feel-like-sandpaper/\n\n---+ For more information:\nHow Cats Lap: Water Uptake by Felis catus\nhttp://science.sciencemag.org/content/330/6008/1231\n\n---+ More Great Deep Look episodes:\n\nIf Your Hands Could Smell, You\u2019d Be an Octopus | Deep Look\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XXMxihOh8ps\n\nArcherfish Says...\"I Spit in Your Face!\" | Deep Look\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gN81dtxilhE\n\nRoly Polies Came From the Sea to Conquer the Earth | Deep Look\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sj8pFX9SOXE\n\n\n---+ See some great videos and documentaries from the PBS Digital Studios!\n\nPigeon Story: How the Rock Dove Became the Sky Rat | It\u2019s OK to be Smart\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8Y7Q1eja-E\n\nEverything is Trying to Kill You\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LB8SqTwT93E\n\n---+ Follow KQED Science:\n\nKQED Science: http://www.kqed.org/science\nTumblr: http://kqedscience.tumblr.com\nTwitter: https://www.twitter.com/kqedscience\n\n---+ About KQED\n\nKQED, an NPR and PBS affiliate in San Francisco, CA, serves Northern California and beyond with a public-supported alternative to commercial TV, Radio and web media.\n\nFunding for Deep Look is provided in part by PBS Digital Studios and the John S. and James L.

And similar to our arms it uses them to grab things and move around. But that\u2019s where the similarities end.  Hundreds of suckers on each octopus arm give them abilities people can only dream about.\n\n\u201cThe suckers are hands that also smell and taste,\u201d said Rich Ross, senior biologist and octopus aquarist at the California Academy of Sciences.  \n\nSuckers are \u201cvery similar to our taste buds, from what little we know about them,\u201d said University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, cephalopod biologist William Kier.\n\nIf these tasting, smelling suckers make you think of a human hand with a tongue and a nose stuck to it, that\u2019s a good start. It all stems from the unique challenges an octopus faces as a result of having a flexible, soft body.  \n\n\u201cThis animal has no protection and is a wonderful meal because it\u2019s all muscle,\u201d said Kier.\n\nSo the octopus has adapted over time. It has about 500 million neurons (dogs have around 600 million), the cells that allow it to process and communicate information. And these neurons are distributed to make the most of its eight arms. An octopus\u2019 central brain \u2013 located between its eyes \u2013 doesn\u2019t control its every move. Instead, two thirds of the animal\u2019s neurons are in its arms.\n\u201cIt\u2019s more efficient to put the nervous cells in the arm,\u201d said neurobiologist Binyamin Hochner, of Hebrew University, in Jerusalem. \u201cThe arm is a brain of its own.\u201d \n\nThis enables octopus arms to operate somewhat independently from the animal\u2019s central brain. The central brain tells the arms in what direction and how fast to move, but the instructions on how to reach are embedded in each arm. \n\nOctopuses have also evolved mechanisms that allow their muscles to move without the use of a skeleton. This same muscle arrangement enables elephant trunks and mammals\u2019 tongues to unfurl.  \n\n\u201cThe arrangement of the muscle in your tongue is similar to the arrangement in the octopus arm,\u201d said Kier.  \n\nIn an octopus arm, muscles are arranged in different directions. When one octopus muscle contracts, it\u2019s able to stretch out again because other muscles oriented in a different direction offer resistance \u2013 just as the bones in vertebrate bodies do. This skeleton of muscle, called a muscular hydrostat, is how an octopus gets its suckers to attach to different surfaces.\n\n--- How many suction cups does an octopus have on each arm?\n\nIt depends on the species. Giant Pacific octopuses have up to 240 suckers on each arm. \n\n--- Do octopuses have arms or tentacles?\n\nOctopuses have arms, not tentacles. \u201cThe term \u2018tentacle\u2019 is used for lots of fleshy protuberances in invertebrates,\u201d said Kier. \u201cIt just happens that the eight in octopuses are called arms.\u201d\n\n--- Can octopuses regrow a severed arm?\n\nYes!\n\n---+ Read the entire article on KQED Science:\n\nhttps://ww2.kqed.org/science/2017/02/14/if-your-hands-could-smell-youd-be-an-octopus/\n\n---+ For more information:\n\nThe octopus research group at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gN81dtxilhE\n\n---+ More Great Deep Look episodes:\n\nYou're Not Hallucinating.

Fortunately, they\u2019re one of our most beloved \u201cbugs.\u201d Pill bugs. Doodle bugs. Potato bugs. Wood Shrimp. Whatever you call them, there\u2019s something less creepy about these critters than other insects. Maybe it\u2019s because they\u2019re not insects at all. \n\nPill bugs are more closely related to a shrimp and lobsters than crickets or butterflies. Their ancestors lived in the sea, but ancient pill bugs crawled out millions of years ago to carve a life for themselves on dry land. \n\nYou can see the evidence if you take a close look at them, so that\u2019s exactly what we did for this episode of Deep Look, an ultra-high definition wildlife video series produced by KQED and PBS DIgital Studios.\n\n\u201cKids love them,\u201d said Jonathan Wright, a professor of biology at Pomona College who studies the charismatic creepy-crawlies. After all, who hasn\u2019t delighted as a youth in annoying a pill bug until it defensively curls up into a little armored ball?\n\nSome adventurous foragers even eat pill bugs.

Fortunately, they\u2019re one of our most beloved \u201cbugs.\u201d Pill bugs. Doodle bugs. Potato bugs. Wood Shrimp. Whatever you call them, there\u2019s something less creepy about these critters than other insects. Maybe it\u2019s because they\u2019re not insects at all. \n\nPill bugs are more closely related to a shrimp and lobsters than crickets or butterflies. Their ancestors lived in the sea, but ancient pill bugs crawled out millions of years ago to carve a life for themselves on dry land. \n\nYou can see the evidence if you take a close look at them, so that\u2019s exactly what we did for this episode of Deep Look, an ultra-high definition wildlife video series produced by KQED and PBS DIgital Studios.\n\n\u201cKids love them,\u201d said Jonathan Wright, a professor of biology at Pomona College who studies the charismatic creepy-crawlies. After all, who hasn\u2019t delighted as a youth in annoying a pill bug until it defensively curls up into a little armored ball?\n\nSome adventurous foragers even eat pill bugs.

                "description": "What if you had to grow 20 pounds of bone on your forehead each year just to find a mate? In a bloody, itchy process, males of the deer family grow a new set of antlers every year, use them to fend off the competition, and lose their impressive crowns when breeding season ends.\n\nSUBSCRIBE to Deep Look! http://goo.gl/8NwXqt\n\nDEEP LOOK is a ultra-HD (4K) short video series created by KQED San Francisco and presented by PBS Digital Studios. See the unseen at the very edge of our visible world. Get a new perspective on our place in the universe. Explore big scientific mysteries by going incredibly small.\n\n* WE\u2019RE TAKING A BREAK FOR THE HOLIDAYS. WATCH OUR NEXT EPISODE ON JAN. 17, 2017. *\n\nAntlers are bones that grow right out of an animal\u2019s head. It all starts with little knobs called pedicles. Reindeer, elk, and their relatives in the cervid family, like moose and deer, are born with them. But in most species pedicles only sprout antlers in males, because antlers require testosterone.\n\nThe little antlers of a young tule elk, or a reindeer, are called spikes. Every year, a male grows a slightly larger set of antlers, until he becomes a \u201csenior\u201d and the antlers start to shrink.\n\nWhile it\u2019s growing, the bone is hidden by a fuzzy layer of skin and fur called velvet that carries blood rich in calcium and phosphorous to build up the bone inside. \n\nWhen the antlers get hard, the blood stops flowing and the velvet cracks. It gets itchy and males scratch like crazy to get it off. From underneath emerges a clean, smooth antler.\n\nMales use their antlers during the mating season as a warning to other males to stay away from females, or to woo the females. When their warnings aren\u2019t heeded, they use them to fight the competition. \n\nOnce the mating season is over and the male no longer needs its antlers, the testosterone in its body drops and the antlers fall off. A new set starts growing almost right away.\n\n--- What are antlers made of?\n\nAntlers are made of bone. \n\n--- What is antler velvet? \n\nVelvet is the skin that covers a developing antler.  \n\n--- What animals have antlers?\n\nMale members of the cervid, or deer, family grow antlers. The only species of deer in which females also grow antlers are reindeer. \n\n--- Are antlers horns? \n\nNo. Horns, which are made of keratin (the same material our nails are made from), stay on an animal its entire life. Antlers fall off and grow back again each year. \n\n---+ Read an article on KQED Science about how neuroscientists are investigating the potential of the nerves in antler velvet to return mobility to damaged human limbs, and perhaps one day even help paralyzed people: \n\nhttps://ww2.kqed.org/science/2016/12/06/rudolphs-antlers-could-help-restore-mobility-in-injured-humans/\n\n---+ For more information on tule elk\n\nhttps://www.nps.gov/pore/learn/nature/tule_elk.htm\n\n---+ More Great Deep Look episodes:\n\nThe Sex Lives of Christmas Trees\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xEji9I4Tcjo\n\nWatch These Frustrated Squirrels Go Nuts!\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZUjQtJGaSpk\n\nThis Mushroom Starts Killing You Before You Even Realize It\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bl9aCH2QaQY\n\n---+ See some great videos and documentaries from PBS Digital Studios!\n\nThe REAL Rudolph Has Bloody Antlers and Super Vision - Gross Science\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gB6ND8nXgjA\n\nGlobal Weirding with Katharine Hayhoe: Texans don't care about climate change, right?\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P_r_6D2LXVs&list=PL1mtdjDVOoOqJzeaJAV15Tq0tZ1vKj7ZV&index=25\n\nIt\u2019s Okay To Be Smart: Why Don\u2019t Woodpeckers Get Concussions?\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqBxbMWd8O0\n\n---+ Follow KQED Science:\n\nKQED Science: http://www.kqed.org/science\nTumblr: http://kqedscience.tumblr.com\nTwitter: https://www.twitter.com/kqedscience\n\n---+ About KQED\n\nKQED, an NPR and PBS affiliate in San Francisco, CA, serves Northern California and beyond with a public-supported alternative to commercial TV, Radio and web media.\n\nFunding for Deep Look is provided in part by PBS Digital Studios and the John S. and James L.

                    "description": "What if you had to grow 20 pounds of bone on your forehead each year just to find a mate? In a bloody, itchy process, males of the deer family grow a new set of antlers every year, use them to fend off the competition, and lose their impressive crowns when breeding season ends.\n\nSUBSCRIBE to Deep Look! http://goo.gl/8NwXqt\n\nDEEP LOOK is a ultra-HD (4K) short video series created by KQED San Francisco and presented by PBS Digital Studios.

Explore big scientific mysteries by going incredibly small.\n\n* WE\u2019RE TAKING A BREAK FOR THE HOLIDAYS. WATCH OUR NEXT EPISODE ON JAN. 17, 2017. *\n\nAntlers are bones that grow right out of an animal\u2019s head. It all starts with little knobs called pedicles. Reindeer, elk, and their relatives in the cervid family, like moose and deer, are born with them. But in most species pedicles only sprout antlers in males, because antlers require testosterone.\n\nThe little antlers of a young tule elk, or a reindeer, are called spikes. Every year, a male grows a slightly larger set of antlers, until he becomes a \u201csenior\u201d and the antlers start to shrink.\n\nWhile it\u2019s growing, the bone is hidden by a fuzzy layer of skin and fur called velvet that carries blood rich in calcium and phosphorous to build up the bone inside. \n\nWhen the antlers get hard, the blood stops flowing and the velvet cracks. It gets itchy and males scratch like crazy to get it off. From underneath emerges a clean, smooth antler.\n\nMales use their antlers during the mating season as a warning to other males to stay away from females, or to woo the females. When their warnings aren\u2019t heeded, they use them to fight the competition. \n\nOnce the mating season is over and the male no longer needs its antlers, the testosterone in its body drops and the antlers fall off. A new set starts growing almost right away.\n\n--- What are antlers made of?\n\nAntlers are made of bone. \n\n--- What is antler velvet? \n\nVelvet is the skin that covers a developing antler.  \n\n--- What animals have antlers?\n\nMale members of the cervid, or deer, family grow antlers. The only species of deer in which females also grow antlers are reindeer. \n\n--- Are antlers horns? \n\nNo. Horns, which are made of keratin (the same material our nails are made from), stay on an animal its entire life. Antlers fall off and grow back again each year. \n\n---+ Read an article on KQED Science about how neuroscientists are investigating the potential of the nerves in antler velvet to return mobility to damaged human limbs, and perhaps one day even help paralyzed people: \n\nhttps://ww2.kqed.org/science/2016/12/06/rudolphs-antlers-could-help-restore-mobility-in-injured-humans/\n\n---+ For more information on tule elk\n\nhttps://www.nps.gov/pore/learn/nature/tule_elk.htm\n\n---+ More Great Deep Look episodes:\n\nThe Sex Lives of Christmas Trees\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xEji9I4Tcjo\n\nWatch These Frustrated Squirrels Go Nuts!\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZUjQtJGaSpk\n\nThis Mushroom Starts Killing You Before You Even Realize It\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bl9aCH2QaQY\n\n---+ See some great videos and documentaries from PBS Digital Studios!\n\nThe REAL Rudolph Has Bloody Antlers and Super Vision - Gross Science\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gB6ND8nXgjA\n\nGlobal Weirding with Katharine Hayhoe: Texans don't care about climate change, right?\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P_r_6D2LXVs&list=PL1mtdjDVOoOqJzeaJAV15Tq0tZ1vKj7ZV&index=25\n\nIt\u2019s Okay To Be Smart: Why Don\u2019t Woodpeckers Get Concussions?\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqBxbMWd8O0\n\n---+ Follow KQED Science:\n\nKQED Science: http://www.kqed.org/science\nTumblr: http://kqedscience.tumblr.com\nTwitter: https://www.twitter.com/kqedscience\n\n---+ About KQED\n\nKQED, an NPR and PBS affiliate in San Francisco, CA, serves Northern California and beyond with a public-supported alternative to commercial TV, Radio and web media.\n\nFunding for Deep Look is provided in part by PBS Digital Studios and the John S. and James L.

Their pay: delicious nectar served up in tiny ant-sized dishes. But will the ants keep up their end of the bargain? \n\nSUBSCRIBE to Deep Look! http://goo.gl/8NwXqt\n\nDEEP LOOK is a ultra-HD (4K) short video series created by KQED San Francisco and presented by PBS Digital Studios.

In the Amazon rainforest of Peru, a type of tree called the Inga actively encourages ants to stick around. \n\nThe tree, which is related to plants that produce beans and other legumes, grows tiny structures near the base of its leaves, called nectaries, that secrete a sugary fluid to feed to the ants. In turn, the ants serve as bodyguards, protecting the Inga and its nectaries from invading herbivores.\n\n\u201cPlants have all kinds of defenses, but because Inga leaves are not as toxic as many other plants,\u201d says Suzanne Koptur, a professor of biology at Florida International University, \u201cthey\u2019re good food for herbivores of all sizes and shapes, from big mammals like sloths and monkeys to little invertebrates like caterpillars.\u201c \n\nThe rainforest is especially dangerous for young trees. The branches and leaves of mature trees merge together high in the air forming a canopy. Young trees on the forest floor struggle to get enough light. Young trees also have fewer leaves, and losing even a few to herbivores can threaten their survival.\n\nThey may be small, but few species want to tangle with the aggressive and territorial big-headed ants.\n\n \"Ants have powers in numbers, especially if they bite and sting,\" says Koptur.\n\nThe ants keep most herbivores, especially hungry caterpillars, away from the young trees. Simply put, the trees provide nectar to the ants in exchange for protection.\n\n--- What is mutualism?\n\nIn biology, mutualism refers to a relationship between two organisms that benefits both of parties.

In the Amazon rainforest of Peru, a type of tree called the Inga actively encourages ants to stick around. \n\nThe tree, which is related to plants that produce beans and other legumes, grows tiny structures near the base of its leaves, called nectaries, that secrete a sugary fluid to feed to the ants. In turn, the ants serve as bodyguards, protecting the Inga and its nectaries from invading herbivores.\n\n\u201cPlants have all kinds of defenses, but because Inga leaves are not as toxic as many other plants,\u201d says Suzanne Koptur, a professor of biology at Florida International University, \u201cthey\u2019re good food for herbivores of all sizes and shapes, from big mammals like sloths and monkeys to little invertebrates like caterpillars.\u201c \n\nThe rainforest is especially dangerous for young trees. The branches and leaves of mature trees merge together high in the air forming a canopy. Young trees on the forest floor struggle to get enough light. Young trees also have fewer leaves, and losing even a few to herbivores can threaten their survival.\n\nThey may be small, but few species want to tangle with the aggressive and territorial big-headed ants.\n\n \"Ants have powers in numbers, especially if they bite and sting,\" says Koptur.\n\nThe ants keep most herbivores, especially hungry caterpillars, away from the young trees. Simply put, the trees provide nectar to the ants in exchange for protection.\n\n--- What is mutualism?\n\nIn biology, mutualism refers to a relationship between two organisms that benefits both of parties. Mutualism is one type of symbiotic relationship.\n\n\n--- What are caterpillars?\n\nCaterpillars are the larvae of butterflies and caterpillars.

                "description": "Termites cause billions of dollars in damage annually \u2013 but they need help to do it. So they carry tiny organisms around with them in their gut. Together, termites and microorganisms can turn the wood in your house into a palace of poop. \n\nSUBSCRIBE to Deep Look! http://goo.gl/8NwXqt\n\nDEEP LOOK is a ultra-HD (4K) short video series created by KQED San Francisco and presented by PBS Digital Studios. See the unseen at the very edge of our visible world. Get a new perspective on our place in the universe. Explore big scientific mysteries by going incredibly small.\n\n* NEW VIDEOS EVERY OTHER TUESDAY! *\n\nTermites such as dampwood termites use their cardboard-like poop pellets to build up their nests, turning a human house into a termite toilet. \u201cThey build their own houses out of their own feces,\u201d said entomologist Michael Scharf, of Purdue University, in Indiana. \n\nAnd while they\u2019re using their poop as a building material, termites are also feeding on the wood. They\u2019re one of the few animals that can extract nutrients from wood. But it turns out that they need help to do this.\n\nA termite\u2019s gut is host to a couple dozen species of protists, organisms that are neither animals, nor plants, nor fungi. Scientists have found that several of them help termites break down wood.\n\nWhen some protists are eliminated from the termite\u2019s gut, the insect can\u2019t get any nutrition out of the wood. This is a weakness that biologists hope to exploit as a way to get rid of termites using biology rather than chemicals. \n\nLouisiana State University entomologist Chinmay Tikhe is working to genetically engineer a bacterium found in the Formosan termite\u2019s gut so that the bacterium will destroy the gut protists. The idea would be to sneak these killer bacteria into the termite colony on some sort of bait the termites would eat and carry back with them.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s like a Trojan Horse,\u201d said Tikhe, referring to the strategy used by the Greeks to sneak their troops into the city of Troy using a wooden horse that was the city\u2019s emblem. \n\nThe bacteria would then kill the protists that help the termite derive nutrition from wood. The termites would eventually starve.\n\n--- How do termites eat wood?\n\nTermites gnaw on the wood. Then they mix it with enzymes that start to break it down. But they need help turning the cellulose in wood into nutrients. They get help from hundreds, and sometimes thousands, of species of microbes that live inside their guts. One bacterium, for example, combines nitrogen from the air and calories from the wood to make protein for the termites. A termite\u2019s gut is also host to a couple dozen species of protists. In the termite\u2019s hindgut, protists ferment the wood into a substance called acetate, which gives the termite energy.\n\n--- How do termites get into our houses?\n\nTermites can crawl up into a house from the soil through specialized tubes made of dirt and saliva, or winged adults can fly in, or both. This depends on the species and caste member involved. \n\n--- What do termites eat in our houses?\n\nOnce they\u2019re established in our houses, termites attack and feed on sources of cellulose, a major component of wood, says entomologist Vernard Lewis, of the University of California, Berkeley.  This could include anything from structural wood and paneling, to furniture and cotton clothing. Termites also will eat dead or living trees, depending on the species.\n\n---+ Read the entire article on KQED Science:\n\nhttps://ww2.kqed.org/science/2016/10/18/these-termites-turn-your-house-into-a-palace-of-poop/\n\n---+ For more information:\n\nUniversity of California Integrated Pest Management Program\u2019s web page on termites:\n\nhttp://ipm.ucanr.edu/PMG/PESTNOTES/pn7415.html\n\n---+ More Great Deep Look episodes:\n\nHow Mosquitoes Use Six Needles to Suck Your Blood:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rD8SmacBUcU\n\nFor These Tiny Spiders, It\u2019s Sing or Get Served:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7qMqAgCqME\n\nWhere are the Ants Carrying All Those Leaves?:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6oKJ5FGk24\n\n---+ See some great videos and documentaries from PBS Digital Studios!\n\nIt\u2019s Okay To Be Smart: The Donald Trump Caterpillar and Nature\u2019s Masters of Disguise\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VTUCTT6I1TU\n\nGross Science: Why Do Dogs Eat Poop?\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3pB-xZGM1U\n\n---+ Follow KQED Science:\n\nKQED Science: http://www.kqed.org/science\nTumblr: http://kqedscience.tumblr.com\nTwitter: https://www.twitter.com/kqedscience\n\n---+ About KQED\n\nKQED, an NPR and PBS affiliate in San Francisco, CA, serves Northern California and beyond with a public-supported alternative to commercial TV, Radio and web media. macro pest control\n#deeplook",

They\u2019re one of the few animals that can extract nutrients from wood. But it turns out that they need help to do this.\n\nA termite\u2019s gut is host to a couple dozen species of protists, organisms that are neither animals, nor plants, nor fungi. Scientists have found that several of them help termites break down wood.\n\nWhen some protists are eliminated from the termite\u2019s gut, the insect can\u2019t get any nutrition out of the wood. This is a weakness that biologists hope to exploit as a way to get rid of termites using biology rather than chemicals. \n\nLouisiana State University entomologist Chinmay Tikhe is working to genetically engineer a bacterium found in the Formosan termite\u2019s gut so that the bacterium will destroy the gut protists. The idea would be to sneak these killer bacteria into the termite colony on some sort of bait the termites would eat and carry back with them.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s like a Trojan Horse,\u201d said Tikhe, referring to the strategy used by the Greeks to sneak their troops into the city of Troy using a wooden horse that was the city\u2019s emblem. \n\nThe bacteria would then kill the protists that help the termite derive nutrition from wood. The termites would eventually starve.\n\n--- How do termites eat wood?\n\nTermites gnaw on the wood. Then they mix it with enzymes that start to break it down. But they need help turning the cellulose in wood into nutrients. They get help from hundreds, and sometimes thousands, of species of microbes that live inside their guts. One bacterium, for example, combines nitrogen from the air and calories from the wood to make protein for the termites. A termite\u2019s gut is also host to a couple dozen species of protists. In the termite\u2019s hindgut, protists ferment the wood into a substance called acetate, which gives the termite energy.\n\n--- How do termites get into our houses?\n\nTermites can crawl up into a house from the soil through specialized tubes made of dirt and saliva, or winged adults can fly in, or both. This depends on the species and caste member involved. \n\n--- What do termites eat in our houses?\n\nOnce they\u2019re established in our houses, termites attack and feed on sources of cellulose, a major component of wood, says entomologist Vernard Lewis, of the University of California, Berkeley.  This could include anything from structural wood and paneling, to furniture and cotton clothing. Termites also will eat dead or living trees, depending on the species.\n\n---+ Read the entire article on KQED Science:\n\nhttps://ww2.kqed.org/science/2016/10/18/these-termites-turn-your-house-into-a-palace-of-poop/\n\n---+ For more information:\n\nUniversity of California Integrated Pest Management Program\u2019s web page on termites:\n\nhttp://ipm.ucanr.edu/PMG/PESTNOTES/pn7415.html\n\n---+ More Great Deep Look episodes:\n\nHow Mosquitoes Use Six Needles to Suck Your Blood:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rD8SmacBUcU\n\nFor These Tiny Spiders, It\u2019s Sing or Get Served:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7qMqAgCqME\n\nWhere are the Ants Carrying All Those Leaves?:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6oKJ5FGk24\n\n---+ See some great videos and documentaries from PBS Digital Studios!\n\nIt\u2019s Okay To Be Smart: The Donald Trump Caterpillar and Nature\u2019s Masters of Disguise\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VTUCTT6I1TU\n\nGross Science: Why Do Dogs Eat Poop?\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3pB-xZGM1U\n\n---+ Follow KQED Science:\n\nKQED Science: http://www.kqed.org/science\nTumblr: http://kqedscience.tumblr.com\nTwitter: https://www.twitter.com/kqedscience\n\n---+ About KQED\n\nKQED, an NPR and PBS affiliate in San Francisco, CA, serves Northern California and beyond with a public-supported alternative to commercial TV, Radio and web media. macro pest control\n#deeplook"

After this incredible odyssey, they undergo one of the most remarkable transformations in nature. \n\nSUBSCRIBE to Deep Look! http://goo.gl/8NwXqt\n\nDEEP LOOK is a ultra-HD (4K) short video series created by KQED San Francisco and presented by PBS Digital Studios.

But they aren\u2019t alone. Just beyond the crashing surf, hundreds of millions of tiny sea urchin larvae are also floating around, preparing for one of the most dramatic transformations in the animal kingdom.\n\nScientists along the Pacific coast are investigating how these microscopic ocean drifters, which look like tiny spaceships, find their way back home to the shoreline, where they attach themselves, grow into spiny creatures and live out a slow-moving life that often exceeds 100 years.\u201cThese sorts of studies are absolutely crucial if we want to not only maintain healthy fisheries but indeed a healthy ocean,\u201d says Jason Hodin, a research scientist at the University of Washington\u2019s Friday Harbor Laboratories.\n\nhttp://staff.washington.edu/hodin/\nhttp://depts.washington.edu/fhl/\n\nSea urchins reproduce by sending clouds of eggs and sperm into the water. Millions of larvae are formed, but only a handful make it back to the shoreline to grow into adults.\n\n\n--- What are sea urchins?\n\nSea urchins are spiny invertebrate animals. Adult sea urchins are globe-shaped and show five-point radial symmetry. They move using a system of tube feet. Sea urchins belong to the phylum Echinodermata along with their relatives the sea stars (starfish), sand dollars and sea slugs.\n\n--- What do sea urchins eat?\n\nSea urchins eat algae and can reduce kelp forests to barrens if their numbers grow too high. A sea urchin\u2019s mouth, referred to as Aristotle\u2019s lantern, is on the underside and has five sharp teeth. The urchin uses the tube feet to move the food to its mouth.\n\n--- How do sea urchins reproduce?\n\nMale sea urchins release clouds of sperm and females release huge numbers of eggs directly into the ocean water. The gametes meet and the sperm fertilize the eggs. The fertilized eggs grow into free-swimming embryos which themselves develop into larvae called plutei. The plutei swim through the ocean as plankton until they drop to the seafloor and metamorphosize into the globe-shaped adult urchins.\n\n\n---+ Read the entire article on KQED Science:\n\nhttps://ww2.kqed.org/science/2016/08/23/sea-urchins-pull-themselves-inside-out-to-be-reborn/\n\n---+ For more information:\n\nMarine Larvae Video Resource\nhttp://marinedevelopmentresource.stanford.edu/\n\n---+ More Great Deep Look episodes:\n\nFrom Drifter to Dynamo: The Story of Plankton | Deep Look\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jUvJ5ANH86I\n\nPygmy Seahorses: Masters of Camouflage | Deep Look\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q3CtGoqz3ww\n\nThe Fantastic Fur of Sea Otters | Deep Look\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zxqg_um1TXI\n\n---+ See some great videos and documentaries from PBS Digital Studios!\n\nIt's Okay To Be Smart: Can Coral Reefs Survive Climate Change?\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P7ydNafXxJI\n\nGross Science: White Sand Beaches Are Made of Fish Poop\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1SfxgY1dIM4\n\n\n---+ Follow KQED Science:\n\nKQED Science: http://www.kqed.org/science\nTumblr: http://kqedscience.tumblr.com\nTwitter: https://www.twitter.com/kqedscience\n\n---+ About KQED\n\nKQED, an NPR and PBS affiliate in San Francisco, CA, serves Northern California and beyond with a public-supported alternative to commercial TV, Radio and web media.\n\nFunding for Deep Look is provided in part by PBS Digital Studios and the John S. and James L.

But they aren\u2019t alone. Just beyond the crashing surf, hundreds of millions of tiny sea urchin larvae are also floating around, preparing for one of the most dramatic transformations in the animal kingdom.\n\nScientists along the Pacific coast are investigating how these microscopic ocean drifters, which look like tiny spaceships, find their way back home to the shoreline, where they attach themselves, grow into spiny creatures and live out a slow-moving life that often exceeds 100 years.\u201cThese sorts of studies are absolutely crucial if we want to not only maintain healthy fisheries but indeed a healthy ocean,\u201d says Jason Hodin, a research scientist at the University of Washington\u2019s Friday Harbor Laboratories.\n\nhttp://staff.washington.edu/hodin/\nhttp://depts.washington.edu/fhl/\n\nSea urchins reproduce by sending clouds of eggs and sperm into the water. Millions of larvae are formed, but only a handful make it back to the shoreline to grow into adults.\n\n\n--- What are sea urchins?\n\nSea urchins are spiny invertebrate animals. Adult sea urchins are globe-shaped and show five-point radial symmetry. They move using a system of tube feet. Sea urchins belong to the phylum Echinodermata along with their relatives the sea stars (starfish), sand dollars and sea slugs.\n\n--- What do sea urchins eat?\n\nSea urchins eat algae and can reduce kelp forests to barrens if their numbers grow too high. A sea urchin\u2019s mouth, referred to as Aristotle\u2019s lantern, is on the underside and has five sharp teeth. The urchin uses the tube feet to move the food to its mouth.\n\n--- How do sea urchins reproduce?\n\nMale sea urchins release clouds of sperm and females release huge numbers of eggs directly into the ocean water. The gametes meet and the sperm fertilize the eggs. The fertilized eggs grow into free-swimming embryos which themselves develop into larvae called plutei. The plutei swim through the ocean as plankton until they drop to the seafloor and metamorphosize into the globe-shaped adult urchins.\n\n\n---+ Read the entire article on KQED Science:\n\nhttps://ww2.kqed.org/science/2016/08/23/sea-urchins-pull-themselves-inside-out-to-be-reborn/\n\n---+ For more information:\n\nMarine Larvae Video Resource\nhttp://marinedevelopmentresource.stanford.edu/\n\n---+ More Great Deep Look episodes:\n\nFrom Drifter to Dynamo: The Story of Plankton | Deep Look\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jUvJ5ANH86I\n\nPygmy Seahorses: Masters of Camouflage | Deep Look\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q3CtGoqz3ww\n\nThe Fantastic Fur of Sea Otters | Deep Look\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zxqg_um1TXI\n\n---+ See some great videos and documentaries from PBS Digital Studios!\n\nIt's Okay To Be Smart: Can Coral Reefs Survive Climate Change?\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P7ydNafXxJI\n\nGross Science: White Sand Beaches Are Made of Fish Poop\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1SfxgY1dIM4\n\n\n---+ Follow KQED Science:\n\nKQED Science: http://www.kqed.org/science\nTumblr: http://kqedscience.tumblr.com\nTwitter: https://www.twitter.com/kqedscience\n\n---+ About KQED\n\nKQED, an NPR and PBS affiliate in San Francisco, CA, serves Northern California and beyond with a public-supported alternative to commercial TV, Radio and web media.\n\nFunding for Deep Look is provided in part by PBS Digital Studios and the John S. and James L.

Caddisflies, a type of stream-dwelling, fish-baiting insects that live in creeks all across the United States.\n\nAs a larva, the caddisfly constructs a tiny tube-like house for itself, called a case, entirely underwater, using pebbles and its incredible homespun tape as the mortar. \n\nThanks to the qualities of this amazing silk, the case not only holds up when submerged, it is strong enough to protect the caddisfly\u2019s soft lower body amid forces many times its body weight.\n\nAny tape, including this one, has two basic components: the flat ribbon, or backing, and the layer of sticky stuff, or the glue. From the materials science standpoint, caddisfly tape is extraordinary in both departments. \n\nCaddisfly silk biomimicry is only in its infancy, but one day, a similar compound might be used inside the body, which is another watery environment, to mend soft tissues and even repair hard ones, such as teeth and bone.\n\nIn the streambed, or brook,  the caddisfly\u2019s case eventually becomes a cocoon. Like its land-based cousins, the butterflies and moths, from whom it diverged 250 millions years ago, the caddisfly larva undergoes a metamorphosis. It seals up its case with a so-called \u201chat stone\u201d and emerges months later as a winged adult. \n\n--- Where do caddisflies live?\n\nCaddisflies are most common in shallow, cold, turbulent streams, where the water is highly oxygenated.\n\n--- What do caddisflies eat?\n\nCaddisflies are herbivores, they eat decaying plant matter and algae on the rocks in the streams where they live.\n\n--- What is so special about caddisfly silk?\n\nEngineers are interested in two attributes of caddisfly silk. First of all, it can bond to something, such as a pebble, underwater, which no glue people have made can replicate. Second its \u201cviscoelastic\u201d properties allow to it harmlessly absorb physical forces. When stretched, it doesn\u2019t snap back like a rubber band. It returns to its original shape slowly and safely. It's an engineering marvel. \n\n---+ Read the entire article on KQED Science:\n\nhttps://ww2.kqed.org/science/2016/08/09/sticky-stretchy-waterproof-the-amazing-underwater-tape-of-the-caddisfly/\n\n---+ For more information:\n\nTroutnut.com \nhttp://www.troutnut.com/hatch/12/Insect-Trichoptera-Caddisflies\n\n---+ More Great Deep Look episodes:\n\nThis Vibrating Bumblebee Unlocks a Flower's Hidden Treasure\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SZrTndD1H10\n\nThese Carnivorous Worms Catch Bugs by Mimicking the Night Sky\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLb0iuTVzW0\n\n---+ See some great videos and documentaries from the PBS Digital Studios!\n\nIt's Okay to Be Smart: Venom: Nature\u2019s Killer Cocktails\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qd92MuVZXik\n\nGross Science: Sea Turtles Get Herpes, Too\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bpqP9bUUInI\n\n---+ Follow KQED Science:\n\nKQED Science: http://www.kqed.org/science\nTumblr: http://kqedscience.tumblr.com\nTwitter: https://www.twitter.com/kqedscience\n\n---+ About KQED\n\nKQED, an NPR and PBS affiliate in San Francisco, CA, serves Northern California and beyond with a public-supported alternative to commercial TV, Radio and web media.\n\nFunding for Deep Look is provided in part by PBS Digital Studios and the John S. and James L.

                "description": "Most flowering plants are more than willing to spread their pollen around. But some flowers hold out for just the right partner. Bumblebees and other buzz pollinators know just how to handle these stubborn flowers. They vibrate the blooms, shaking them until they give up the nutritious pollen.\n\nSUBSCRIBE to Deep Look! http://goo.gl/8NwXqt\n\nDEEP LOOK is a ultra-HD (4K) short video series created by KQED San Francisco and presented by PBS Digital Studios.

Explore big scientific mysteries by going incredibly small.\n\n* NEW VIDEOS EVERY OTHER TUESDAY! *\n\nIn the summertime, the air is thick with the low humming of bees delivering pollen from one flower to the next. If you listen closely, a louder buzz may catch your ear.\n\nThis sound is the key to a secret stash of pollen that some flowers hide deep within their anthers, the male parts of the plant. Only pollinators that buzz in just the right way can vibrate tiny grains out of minuscule holes at the top of the anthers for a protein-rich snack.\n\nThe strategy, called buzz-pollination, is risky. But it\u2019s also critical to human agriculture. Tomatoes, potatoes and eggplants need wild populations of buzz pollinators, such as bumblebees, to produce fruit. Honeybees can\u2019t do it.\n\nPlants need a way to get the pollen \u2014 basically sperm \u2014 to the female parts of another flower. Most plants lure animal pollinators to spread these male gametes by producing sugary nectar. The bee laps up the sweet reward, is dusted with pollen and passively delivers it to the next bloom.\n\nIn contrast, buzz-pollinated flowers encourage bees to eat the pollen directly and hope some grains will make it to another flower. The evolutionary strategy is baffling to scientists.\n\n\u201cThe flower is almost like playing hard to get,\u201d says Anne Leonard, a biologist at the University of Nevada, Reno who studies buzz pollination. \u201cIt\u2019s intriguing because these buzz-pollinated plants ask for a huge energy investment from the bees, but don\u2019t give much back.\u201d\n\n\n--- What is buzz pollination?\nMost flowering plants use sugary nectar as bait to attract bees and other pollinators, which get coated in pollen along the way. And since bees are messy, they inadvertently scatter some of that pollen onto the female part of the next flower they visit. \n\nBut some flowers lock their pollen up in their anthers, the male parts of the flower, instead of giving it away freely. The only way for the pollen to escape is through small holes called pores. Some pollinators like bumblebees (but not honeybees) are able to vibrate the flower\u2019s anthers which shakes up the pollen and causes it to spew out of the pores. \n\nThe bumblebee collects the pollen and uses it as a reliable and protected source of protein. \n\n--- What important crops use buzz pollination to make food?\n\nThe most important crops that use buzz pollination are potatoes, tomatoes, pumpkins, eggplants, cranberries and blueberries \n\n\n--- What animals are capable of buzz pollination?\nMany types of bees engage in buzz pollination, also called sonication. The most common is probably the bumblebee. Honeybees generally don\u2019t use buzz pollination.\n\n---+ Read the entire article on KQED Science: \nhttps://ww2.kqed.org/science/2016/07/19/this-vibrating-bumblebee-unlocks-a-flowers-hidden-treasure/\n\n---+ For more information:\n\nAnne Leonard Lab, University of Nevada, Reno | Department of Biology\nhttp://www.anneleonard.com/buzz-pollination/\n\n---+ More Great Deep Look episodes:\n\nThese Lizards Have Been Playing Rock-Paper-Scissors for 15 Million Years | Deep Look\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rafdHxBwIbQ\n\nWinter is Coming For These Argentine Ant Invaders | Deep Look\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=boyzWeHdtiI\n\n---+ See some great videos and documentaries from the PBS Digital Studios!\n\nIt's Okay to Be Smart: Why Don't Other Animals Wear Glasses?\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhubEq6W9GE\n\nGross Science: The World's Most Expensive Fungus\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iV4WHFU2Id8\n\n---+ Follow KQED Science:\n\nKQED Science: http://www.kqed.org/science\nTumblr: http://kqedscience.tumblr.com\nTwitter: https://www.twitter.com/kqedscience\n\n---+ About KQED\n\nKQED, an NPR and PBS affiliate in San Francisco, CA, serves Northern California and beyond with a public-supported alternative to commercial TV, Radio and web media.\n\nFunding for Deep Look is provided in part by PBS Digital Studios and the John S. and James L.

Bumblebees and other buzz pollinators know just how to handle these stubborn flowers.

Explore big scientific mysteries by going incredibly small.\n\n* NEW VIDEOS EVERY OTHER TUESDAY! *\n\nIn the summertime, the air is thick with the low humming of bees delivering pollen from one flower to the next. If you listen closely, a louder buzz may catch your ear.\n\nThis sound is the key to a secret stash of pollen that some flowers hide deep within their anthers, the male parts of the plant. Only pollinators that buzz in just the right way can vibrate tiny grains out of minuscule holes at the top of the anthers for a protein-rich snack.\n\nThe strategy, called buzz-pollination, is risky. But it\u2019s also critical to human agriculture. Tomatoes, potatoes and eggplants need wild populations of buzz pollinators, such as bumblebees, to produce fruit. Honeybees can\u2019t do it.\n\nPlants need a way to get the pollen \u2014 basically sperm \u2014 to the female parts of another flower. Most plants lure animal pollinators to spread these male gametes by producing sugary nectar. The bee laps up the sweet reward, is dusted with pollen and passively delivers it to the next bloom.\n\nIn contrast, buzz-pollinated flowers encourage bees to eat the pollen directly and hope some grains will make it to another flower. The evolutionary strategy is baffling to scientists.\n\n\u201cThe flower is almost like playing hard to get,\u201d says Anne Leonard, a biologist at the University of Nevada, Reno who studies buzz pollination. \u201cIt\u2019s intriguing because these buzz-pollinated plants ask for a huge energy investment from the bees, but don\u2019t give much back.\u201d\n\n\n--- What is buzz pollination?\nMost flowering plants use sugary nectar as bait to attract bees and other pollinators, which get coated in pollen along the way. And since bees are messy, they inadvertently scatter some of that pollen onto the female part of the next flower they visit. \n\nBut some flowers lock their pollen up in their anthers, the male parts of the flower, instead of giving it away freely. The only way for the pollen to escape is through small holes called pores. Some pollinators like bumblebees (but not honeybees) are able to vibrate the flower\u2019s anthers which shakes up the pollen and causes it to spew out of the pores. \n\nThe bumblebee collects the pollen and uses it as a reliable and protected source of protein. \n\n--- What important crops use buzz pollination to make food?\n\nThe most important crops that use buzz pollination are potatoes, tomatoes, pumpkins, eggplants, cranberries and blueberries \n\n\n--- What animals are capable of buzz pollination?\nMany types of bees engage in buzz pollination, also called sonication. The most common is probably the bumblebee. Honeybees generally don\u2019t use buzz pollination.\n\n---+ Read the entire article on KQED Science: \nhttps://ww2.kqed.org/science/2016/07/19/this-vibrating-bumblebee-unlocks-a-flowers-hidden-treasure/\n\n---+ For more information:\n\nAnne Leonard Lab, University of Nevada, Reno | Department of Biology\nhttp://www.anneleonard.com/buzz-pollination/\n\n---+ More Great Deep Look episodes:\n\nThese Lizards Have Been Playing Rock-Paper-Scissors for 15 Million Years | Deep Look\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rafdHxBwIbQ\n\nWinter is Coming For These Argentine Ant Invaders | Deep Look\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=boyzWeHdtiI\n\n---+ See some great videos and documentaries from the PBS Digital Studios!\n\nIt's Okay to Be Smart: Why Don't Other Animals Wear Glasses?\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhubEq6W9GE\n\nGross Science: The World's Most Expensive Fungus\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iV4WHFU2Id8\n\n---+ Follow KQED Science:\n\nKQED Science: http://www.kqed.org/science\nTumblr: http://kqedscience.tumblr.com\nTwitter: https://www.twitter.com/kqedscience\n\n---+ About KQED\n\nKQED, an NPR and PBS affiliate in San Francisco, CA, serves Northern California and beyond with a public-supported alternative to commercial TV, Radio and web media.\n\nFunding for Deep Look is provided in part by PBS Digital Studios and the John S. and James L.

Explore big scientific mysteries by going incredibly small.\n\nLike fireflies, the spectacular worms of New Zealand\u2019s Waitomo Caves glow by breaking down a light-emitting protein. But unlike the yellow mating flashes of fireflies, the glow worms\u2019 steady blue light has a more insidious purpose: it\u2019s bait.\n\nThe strategy is simple. Many of the glow worms\u2019 prey are insects, including moths, that navigate by starlight. With imposter stars all around, the insects become disoriented and fly into a waiting snare. Once the victim has exhausted itself trying to get free, the glow worm reels in the catch. \n\nThe prey is typically still alive when it arrives at the glow worm\u2019s mouth, which has teeth sharp enough to bore through insect exoskeletons. \n\nGlow worms live in colonies, and researchers have noticed that individual worms seem to sync their lights to the members of their colony, brightening and dimming on a 24-hour cycle. There can be several colonies of glow worms in a cave, and studies have shown that different colonies are on different cycles, taking turns at peak illumination, when they\u2019re most attractive to prey.\n\nNot surprisingly, the worms glow brighter when they\u2019re hungry.\n\n--- How do glow worms glow?\n\nTheir light is the result of a chemical reaction. The worms break down a protein called luciferin using an enzyme, luciferase, in a specialized section of their digestive tract. The glow shines through their translucent skin.\n\n--- Why do glow worms live in caves?\n\nThe glow worms need to be in a dark environment where their light can be seen. Caves also shelter them from the wind, which can tangle their dangling snares. \n\n--- Where can I see glow worms?\n\nThe Waitomo Caves are on New Zealand\u2019s North Island. Other New Zealand glow worm sites include the Te Anau caves, Lake Rotoiti, Paparoa National Park, and Waipu.

The most dangerous animal in the world uses six needle-like mouthparts to saw into our skin, tap a blood vessel and sometimes leave a dangerous parting gift.\n\nSUBSCRIBE to Deep Look! http://goo.gl/8NwXqt\n\nDEEP LOOK is a ultra-HD (4K) short video series created by KQED San Francisco and presented by PBS Digital Studios.  Explore big scientific mysteries by going incredibly small.\n\nScientists have discovered that the mosquito\u2019s mouth, called a proboscis isn\u2019t just one tiny spear. It\u2019s a sophisticated system of thin needles, each of which pierces the skin, finds blood vessels and makes it easy for mosquitoes to suck blood out of them. \n\nMale mosquitoes don\u2019t bite us, but when a female mosquito pierces the skin, a flexible lip-like sheath called the labium scrolls up and stays outside as she pushes in six needle-like parts that scientists refer to as stylets. \n\nTwo of these needles, called maxillae, have tiny teeth. The mosquito uses them to saw through the skin. They\u2019re so sharp you can barely feel the mosquito biting you. \n\n\u201cThey\u2019re like drill bits,\u201d said University of California, Davis, biochemist Walter Leal.\n\nAnother set of needles, the mandibles, hold tissues apart while the mosquito works.\n\nThen the sharp-tipped labrum needle probes under the skin, piercing a vessel and sucking blood from it. \n\nThe sixth needle \u2013 called the hypopharynx \u2013 drools saliva into us, and delivers chemicals that keep our blood flowing. Mosquito saliva also makes our blood vessels dilate, blocks our immune response and lubricates the proboscis.

The most dangerous animal in the world uses six needle-like mouthparts to saw into our skin, tap a blood vessel and sometimes leave a dangerous parting gift.\n\nSUBSCRIBE to Deep Look! http://goo.gl/8NwXqt\n\nDEEP LOOK is a ultra-HD (4K) short video series created by KQED San Francisco and presented by PBS Digital Studios.  Explore big scientific mysteries by going incredibly small.\n\nScientists have discovered that the mosquito\u2019s mouth, called a proboscis isn\u2019t just one tiny spear. It\u2019s a sophisticated system of thin needles, each of which pierces the skin, finds blood vessels and makes it easy for mosquitoes to suck blood out of them. \n\nMale mosquitoes don\u2019t bite us, but when a female mosquito pierces the skin, a flexible lip-like sheath called the labium scrolls up and stays outside as she pushes in six needle-like parts that scientists refer to as stylets. \n\nTwo of these needles, called maxillae, have tiny teeth. The mosquito uses them to saw through the skin. They\u2019re so sharp you can barely feel the mosquito biting you. \n\n\u201cThey\u2019re like drill bits,\u201d said University of California, Davis, biochemist Walter Leal.\n\nAnother set of needles, the mandibles, hold tissues apart while the mosquito works.\n\nThen the sharp-tipped labrum needle probes under the skin, piercing a vessel and sucking blood from it. \n\nThe sixth needle \u2013 called the hypopharynx \u2013 drools saliva into us, and delivers chemicals that keep our blood flowing. Mosquito saliva also makes our blood vessels dilate, blocks our immune response and lubricates the proboscis.  It causes us to develop itchy welts, and serves as a conduit for dangerous viruses and parasites.\n\n---+ Read the entire article on KQED Science:\nhttp://ww2.kqed.org/science/2016/06/07/how-mosquitoes-use-six-needles-to-suck-your-blood\n\n---+ What is the deadliest animal in the world?\nMosquitoes are the deadliest animals in the world to us humans.

                "description": "Male side-blotched lizards have more than one way to get the girl. Orange males are bullies. Yellows are sneaks. Blues team up with a buddy to protect their territories. Who wins? It depends - on a genetic game of roshambo. \n\nSUBSCRIBE to Deep Look! http://goo.gl/8NwXqt\n\nDEEP LOOK is a ultra-HD (4K) short video series created by KQED San Francisco and presented by PBS Digital Studios. See the unseen at the very edge of our visible world. Get a new perspective on our place in the universe. Explore big scientific mysteries by going incredibly small.\n\n* NEW VIDEOS EVERY OTHER TUESDAY! *\n\nEvery spring, keen-eyed biologists carrying fishing poles search the rolling hills near Los Banos, about two hours south of San Francisco. But they\u2019re not looking for fish. They\u2019re catching rock-paper-scissors lizards.\n\nThe research team collects Western side-blotched lizards, which come in different shades of blue, orange and yellow. \n\nBarry Sinervo, a professor of ecology and evolutionary biology at UC Santa Cruz, leads the team. Their intricate mating strategies reminded the the researchers of the rock-paper-scissors game where rock beats scissors, scissors beats paper and paper beats rock.\n\nIt\u2019s all about territories. Orange males tend to be the biggest and most aggressive. They hold large territories with several females each and are able to oust the somewhat smaller and less aggressive blues. Blue males typically hold smaller territories and more monogamous, each focusing his interest on a single female. Yellow males tend not to even form exclusive territories Instead they use stealth to find unaccompanied females with whom to mate.\n\nThe yellow males are particularly successful with females that live in territories held by their more aggressive orange competitors. Because the orange males spread their attention among several females, they aren\u2019t able to guard each individual female against intruding yellow males. But the more monogamous blues males are more vigilant and chase sneaky yellow males away.\n\nTheir different strategies keep each other in check making the system stable. Sinervo believes this game has likely been in play for at least 15 million years.\n\n--- How do side-blotched lizards choose a mate?\n\nThe males compete with each other, sometimes violently, for access to females. The females generally prefer males of their own color but also give preference to whichever color male is more rare that mating season.\n\n--- Why do lizards do push up and down?\nMale lizards do little pushups as a territorial display meant to tell competitors to back off. It\u2019s best to use a warning instead of fighting right away because there\u2019s always a danger of getting hurt in a fight. Some lizards like side-blotched lizards also use slow push ups to warn their neighbors of an incoming threat.\n\n--- Why do side-blotched lizards fight?\nSometimes aggressive territorial displays are not enough to dissuade invaders so side-blotched lizards will resort to fighting. They have small sharp teeth and will lunge at each other inflicting bites and headbutts. \n\n---+ Read the entire article on KQED Science: https://ww2.kqed.org/science/2016/05/17/these-lizards-have-been-playing-rock-paper-scissors-for-15-million-years/\n\n---+ For more information: \n\nThe Lab of Dr. Barry Sinervo, LizardLand, University of California, Santa Cruz http://bio.research.ucsc.edu/~barrylab/lizardland/game.html\n\n---+ More Great Deep Look episodes:\n\nMeet the Dust Mites, Tiny Roommates That Feast On Your Skin\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ACrLMtPyRM0\n\nStinging Scorpion vs. Pain-Defying Mouse\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w-K_YtWqMro\n\nThese Crazy Cute Baby Turtles Want Their Lake Back\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YTYFdpNpkMY\n\n---+ See some great videos and documentaries from the PBS Digital Studios!\n\nIt's Okay to Be Smart: The Cosmic Afterglow\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZvrHL7-c1Ys\n\nIt's Okay to Be Smart: The Most Important Moment in the History of Life\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jf06MlX8yik\n\n---+ Follow KQED Science:\n\nKQED Science: http://www.kqed.org/science\nTumblr: http://kqedscience.tumblr.com\nTwitter: https://www.twitter.com/kqedscience\n\n---+ About KQED\n\nKQED, an NPR and PBS affiliate based in San Francisco, serves the people of Northern California and beyond with a public-supported alternative to commercial media.

But they\u2019re not looking for fish. They\u2019re catching rock-paper-scissors lizards.\n\nThe research team collects Western side-blotched lizards, which come in different shades of blue, orange and yellow. \n\nBarry Sinervo, a professor of ecology and evolutionary biology at UC Santa Cruz, leads the team. Their intricate mating strategies reminded the the researchers of the rock-paper-scissors game where rock beats scissors, scissors beats paper and paper beats rock.\n\nIt\u2019s all about territories. Orange males tend to be the biggest and most aggressive. They hold large territories with several females each and are able to oust the somewhat smaller and less aggressive blues. Blue males typically hold smaller territories and more monogamous, each focusing his interest on a single female. Yellow males tend not to even form exclusive territories Instead they use stealth to find unaccompanied females with whom to mate.\n\nThe yellow males are particularly successful with females that live in territories held by their more aggressive orange competitors. Because the orange males spread their attention among several females, they aren\u2019t able to guard each individual female against intruding yellow males. But the more monogamous blues males are more vigilant and chase sneaky yellow males away.\n\nTheir different strategies keep each other in check making the system stable. Sinervo believes this game has likely been in play for at least 15 million years.\n\n--- How do side-blotched lizards choose a mate?\n\nThe males compete with each other, sometimes violently, for access to females. The females generally prefer males of their own color but also give preference to whichever color male is more rare that mating season.\n\n--- Why do lizards do push up and down?\nMale lizards do little pushups as a territorial display meant to tell competitors to back off. It\u2019s best to use a warning instead of fighting right away because there\u2019s always a danger of getting hurt in a fight. Some lizards like side-blotched lizards also use slow push ups to warn their neighbors of an incoming threat.\n\n--- Why do side-blotched lizards fight?\nSometimes aggressive territorial displays are not enough to dissuade invaders so side-blotched lizards will resort to fighting. They have small sharp teeth and will lunge at each other inflicting bites and headbutts. \n\n---+ Read the entire article on KQED Science: https://ww2.kqed.org/science/2016/05/17/these-lizards-have-been-playing-rock-paper-scissors-for-15-million-years/\n\n---+ For more information: \n\nThe Lab of Dr. Barry Sinervo, LizardLand, University of California, Santa Cruz http://bio.research.ucsc.edu/~barrylab/lizardland/game.html\n\n---+ More Great Deep Look episodes:\n\nMeet the Dust Mites, Tiny Roommates That Feast On Your Skin\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ACrLMtPyRM0\n\nStinging Scorpion vs. Pain-Defying Mouse\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w-K_YtWqMro\n\nThese Crazy Cute Baby Turtles Want Their Lake Back\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YTYFdpNpkMY\n\n---+ See some great videos and documentaries from the PBS Digital Studios!\n\nIt's Okay to Be Smart: The Cosmic Afterglow\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZvrHL7-c1Ys\n\nIt's Okay to Be Smart: The Most Important Moment in the History of Life\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jf06MlX8yik\n\n---+ Follow KQED Science:\n\nKQED Science: http://www.kqed.org/science\nTumblr: http://kqedscience.tumblr.com\nTwitter: https://www.twitter.com/kqedscience\n\n---+ About KQED\n\nKQED, an NPR and PBS affiliate based in San Francisco, serves the people of Northern California and beyond with a public-supported alternative to commercial media.

The students watched the winter ants wave their abdomens at their enemies, known as \u201cgaster-flagging\u201d in ant circles, before a cloudy liquid blob appeared at the tip. \n\nApproaching the secretion sent the Argentines reeling away.

If you were to film this goop and play the video back in high speed, you\u2019d see something that might remind you of the 1950s sci-fi classic \u201cThe Blob:\u201d a jelly-like creature pulsating in a strange way, a little bit forward, a little bit back, spreading and searching for something to devour.\n \nBut this creature isn\u2019t intent on world domination. It\u2019s a slime mold, a very simple organism that is neither plant, nor animal, nor fungus. Unlike the cells of other living beings, which have only one nucleus that carries their genetic information, slime molds can organize into something like a cell with thousands of nuclei. Slime molds may move slowly, but they excite scientists by their ability to get a lot done with very little. \n\nResearchers at the University of California San Diego and UC Davis have been focusing their attention on how slime molds get around, in the hope of inspiring a new generation of soft-bodied robots with medical applications. \n\nSlime molds don\u2019t have legs or any appendages.

In the lab, Del Alamo and his colleagues cut off small pieces of a bright yellow slime mold called Physarum polycephalum and put them under a microscope. They watched each piece squeeze itself.

The slime mold contracts its wall, then sloshes to move the calcium ions back so that they can trigger another contraction \u2013 at least that\u2019s the researchers\u2019 hypothesis. \n\n---+ What are slime molds?\n\nLet\u2019s start with what they\u2019re not. They can stand upright and produce spores.  But they\u2019re not fungi or plants. When they\u2019re hungry, they spread across the forest chasing food such as tiny fungi or bacteria. But they\u2019re not animals.\n\n---+ Where are slime molds often found? \n\nSlime molds are often found under rotting logs. You can also order the bright yellow slime mold in our video, Physarum polycephalum, from biological supplies companies.

Many of them are harmless, but a few can be dangerous in ways you wouldn't expect. New research explores exactly whom you share your home with and how they got there.\n\nSUBSCRIBE to Deep Look! http://goo.gl/8NwXqt\n\nDEEP LOOK: a new ultra-HD (4K) short video series created by KQED San Francisco and presented by PBS Digital Studios. See the unseen at the very edge of our visible world. Get a new perspective on our place in the universe and meet extraordinary new friends. Explore big scientific mysteries by going incredibly small.\n\n---+ About Dust Mites\n\nWith the warming weather it\u2019s the season for spring cleaning. But before you reach for the broom and mop, take a moment to look at who else is sharing your home with you. The number of uninvited guests you find in your dustpan may surprise you.\n\nA recent study published in the journal PeerJ took up the challenge of cataloging the large numbers of tiny animals that live in human dwellings. The researchers found that the average home contains roughly 100 different species of arthropods, including familiar types like flies, spiders and ants, but also some kinds that are less well known like gall wasps and book lice. And no matter how much human residents may clean, there will always be a considerable number of mini-roommates.\n\n\u201cEven as entomologists we were really surprised. We live in our houses all the time, so we thought we\u2019d be more familiar with the kind of things we\u2019d come across. There was a surprising level of biodiversity,\u201d said Michelle Trautwein, assistant curator of entomology at the California Academy of Sciences in San Francisco.\n\n---+ What are dust mites?\n\nDust mites are tiny animals, related to spiders, that are usually too small to be seen with the naked eye. They feed on dead skin that humans shed every day and their droppings may cause allergic reactions and may aggravate asthma, especially in children.\n\n---+ How do you minimize dust mites? \n\nIt\u2019s practically impossible to completely rid a home of dust mites, but frequent cleaning and removing carpeting can help. Wet cleaning like mopping helps keep from stirring up dust while cleaning. The most effective way to keep dust mite populations down is to keep the indoor humidity level low. Dust mites can only survive in humid environments. \n\n---+ How do you see dust mites?\n\nDust mites are about .2mm long. You can see dust mites with a powerful magnifying glass, but you can get a better view by using a  microscope.\n\nRead the entire article on KQED Science: \nhttp://ww2.kqed.org/science/2016/04/05/meet-the-dust-mites-tiny-roommates-that-feast-on-your-skin/\n\n\n---+ More great DEEP LOOK episodes:\n\nThe Bombardier Beetle And Its Crazy Chemical Cannon\nhttp://ww2.kqed.org/science/2016/04/05/meet-the-dust-mites-tiny-roommates-that-feast-on-your-skin/\n\nWhere Are the Ants Carrying All Those Leaves?\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6oKJ5FGk24\n\nBanana Slugs: Secret of the Slime\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHvCQSGanJg\n\n--- Super videos from the PBS Digital Studios Network!\n\nIt's Okay To Be Smart: How Do Bees Make Honey?\nhttps://youtu.be/nZlEjDLJCmg\n\nGross Science: What's Living On Your Contact Lenses?\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRMKzsU9zec\n\nGross Science: You Have Mites Living On Your Face\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oMmCWx8vySs\n\n--- More content from KQED Science,  Northern California's PBS and NPR affiliate:\n\nKQED Science: http://www.kqed.org/science\nTumblr: http://kqedscience.tumblr.com\nTwitter: https://www.twitter.com/kqedscience\n\nFunding for Deep Look is provided in part by PBS Digital Studios and the John S. and James L.

                    "description": "You may think that you've got the house to yourself, but chances are you have about 100 different types of animals living with you. Many of them are harmless, but a few can be dangerous in ways you wouldn't expect. New research explores exactly whom you share your home with and how they got there.\n\nSUBSCRIBE to Deep Look! http://goo.gl/8NwXqt\n\nDEEP LOOK: a new ultra-HD (4K) short video series created by KQED San Francisco and presented by PBS Digital Studios.

Explore big scientific mysteries by going incredibly small.\n\n---+ About Dust Mites\n\nWith the warming weather it\u2019s the season for spring cleaning. But before you reach for the broom and mop, take a moment to look at who else is sharing your home with you. The number of uninvited guests you find in your dustpan may surprise you.\n\nA recent study published in the journal PeerJ took up the challenge of cataloging the large numbers of tiny animals that live in human dwellings. The researchers found that the average home contains roughly 100 different species of arthropods, including familiar types like flies, spiders and ants, but also some kinds that are less well known like gall wasps and book lice. And no matter how much human residents may clean, there will always be a considerable number of mini-roommates.\n\n\u201cEven as entomologists we were really surprised. We live in our houses all the time, so we thought we\u2019d be more familiar with the kind of things we\u2019d come across. There was a surprising level of biodiversity,\u201d said Michelle Trautwein, assistant curator of entomology at the California Academy of Sciences in San Francisco.\n\n---+ What are dust mites?\n\nDust mites are tiny animals, related to spiders, that are usually too small to be seen with the naked eye. They feed on dead skin that humans shed every day and their droppings may cause allergic reactions and may aggravate asthma, especially in children.\n\n---+ How do you minimize dust mites? \n\nIt\u2019s practically impossible to completely rid a home of dust mites, but frequent cleaning and removing carpeting can help. Wet cleaning like mopping helps keep from stirring up dust while cleaning. The most effective way to keep dust mite populations down is to keep the indoor humidity level low. Dust mites can only survive in humid environments. \n\n---+ How do you see dust mites?\n\nDust mites are about .2mm long. You can see dust mites with a powerful magnifying glass, but you can get a better view by using a  microscope.\n\nRead the entire article on KQED Science: \nhttp://ww2.kqed.org/science/2016/04/05/meet-the-dust-mites-tiny-roommates-that-feast-on-your-skin/\n\n\n---+ More great DEEP LOOK episodes:\n\nThe Bombardier Beetle And Its Crazy Chemical Cannon\nhttp://ww2.kqed.org/science/2016/04/05/meet-the-dust-mites-tiny-roommates-that-feast-on-your-skin/\n\nWhere Are the Ants Carrying All Those Leaves?\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6oKJ5FGk24\n\nBanana Slugs: Secret of the Slime\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHvCQSGanJg\n\n--- Super videos from the PBS Digital Studios Network!\n\nIt's Okay To Be Smart: How Do Bees Make Honey?\nhttps://youtu.be/nZlEjDLJCmg\n\nGross Science: What's Living On Your Contact Lenses?\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRMKzsU9zec\n\nGross Science: You Have Mites Living On Your Face\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oMmCWx8vySs\n\n--- More content from KQED Science,  Northern California's PBS and NPR affiliate:\n\nKQED Science: http://www.kqed.org/science\nTumblr: http://kqedscience.tumblr.com\nTwitter: https://www.twitter.com/kqedscience\n\nFunding for Deep Look is provided in part by PBS Digital Studios and the John S. and James L.

Its sting can cause sharp pain along with tingling, swelling, numbness, dizziness, shortness of breath, muscular convulsions, involuntary eye movements, coughing and vomiting. Children under two years old are especially vulnerable. Since 2000, three human deaths have been attributed to the Arizona bark scorpion in the United States, all within Arizona.\n\nBut there is one unlikely creature that appears unimpressed. While it may not look the part, the Southern grasshopper mouse (Onychomys torridus) is an extremely capable hunter. It fearlessly stalks and devours any beetles or grasshoppers that have the misfortune to cross its path. But this mouse has a particular taste for scorpions.\n\nThe scorpion venom contains neurotoxins that target sodium and potassium ion channels, proteins embedded within the surface of the nerve and muscle cells that play an important role in regulating the sensation of pain. Activating these channels sends signals down the nerves to the brain. That\u2019s what causes the excruciating pain that human victims have described as the feeling like getting jabbed with a hot needle. Others compare the pain to an electric shock. But the grasshopper mouse has an entirely different reaction when stung.\n\nWithin the mouse, a special protein in one of the sodium ion channels binds to the scorpion\u2019s neurotoxin. Once bound, the neurotoxin is unable to activate the sodium ion channel and send the pain signal. Instead it has the entirely opposite effect. It shuts down the channel, keeping it from sending any signals, which has a numbing effect for the mouse.\n\n\n--- How many species of scorpion are there?\n\nThere are almost 2,000 scorpion species, but only 30 or 40 have strong enough poison to kill a person. \n\n--- Are scorpions insects?\n\nScorpions are members of the class Arachnida and are closely related to spiders, mites, and ticks. \n\n--- Where do Arizona bark scorpions live? \n\nCommonly found in the Sonoran Desert, the Arizona bark scorpion (Centruroides sculpturatus) is the most dangerous scorpion in the continental United States. The Arizona bark scorpion\u2019s preference for hanging to the underside of objects makes dangerous encounters with humans more likely.\n\n\nRead the entire article on KQED Science: \n\nhttp://ww2.kqed.org/science/2016/03/08/stinging-scorpion-vs-pain-defying-mouse/\n\nFor more information: \n\nMichigan State University Venom Evolution: http://venomevolution.zoology.msu.edu/\nInstitute for Biodiversity Science and Sustainability at the California Academy of Sciences: http://www.calacademy.org/scientists\n\n\nMore great Deep Look episodes:\nWhat Happens When You Zap Coral With The World's Most Powerful X-ray Laser?\nhttps://youtu.be/aXmCU6IYnsA\n\nThese 'Resurrection Plants' Spring Back to Life in Seconds\nhttps://youtu.be/eoFGKlZMo2g\n\n\nSee some great videos and documentaries from the PBS Digital Studios!\n\nIt's Okay to Be Smart: Your Salad Is Trying To Kill You\nhttps://youtu.be/8Ofgj2KDbfk\n\nIt's Okay to Be Smart: The Oldest Living Things In The World\nhttps://youtu.be/jgspUYDwnzQ\n\n\nFor more content from KQED Science:\nKQED Science: http://www.kqed.org/science\nTumblr: http://kqedscience.tumblr.com\nTwitter: https://www.twitter.com/kqedscience\n\nFunding for Deep Look is provided in part by PBS Digital Studios and the John S. and James L.

They have also been found under pines, and in Yosemite Valley under black oaks. \n\nWhy do death caps grow under trees?\nAs many fungi do, death cap mushrooms live off of trees, in what\u2019s called a mycorrhizal relationship. They send filaments deep down to the trees\u2019 roots, where they attach to the very thin root tips. The fungi absorb sugars from the trees and give them nutrients in exchange.\n\nWhere do California\u2019s death cap mushrooms come from? \nBiologist Anne Pringle, at the University of Wisconsin, Madison, has done research that shows that death caps likely snuck into California from Europe attached to the roots of imported plants, as early as 1938.\n\nHow deadly are death cap mushrooms? \nBetween 2010 and 2015, five people died in California and 57 became sick after eating the unassuming greenish mushrooms, according to the California Poison Control System. One mushroom cap is enough to kill a human being, and they\u2019re also poisonous to dogs. Death caps are believed to be the number one cause of fatal mushroom poisonings worldwide.\n\nWhat happens if you eat a death cap mushroom?\nA toxin in the mushroom destroys your liver cells. Dr. Kent Olson, co-medical director of the San Francisco Division of the California Poison Control System, said that for the first six to 12 hours after they eat the mushroom, victims of the death cap feel fine. During that time, a toxin in the mushroom is quietly injuring their liver cells. Patients then develop severe abdominal pain, diarrhea and vomiting. \u201cThey can become very rapidly dehydrated from the fluid losses,\u201d said Olson. Dehydration can cause kidney failure, which compounds the damage to the liver. For the most severe cases, the only way to save the patient is a liver transplant.\n\nFor more information on the death cap: \n\nBay Area Mycological Society\u2019s page with photos: http://bayareamushrooms.org/mushroommonth/amanita_phalloides.html\n\nRod Tulloss\u2019 detailed description: http://www.amanitaceae.org/?Amanita%20phalloides\n\n\nMore great Deep Look episodes:\nWhat Happens When You Zap Coral With The World's Most Powerful X-ray Laser?\nhttps://youtu.be/aXmCU6IYnsA\n\nThese 'Resurrection Plants' Spring Back to Life in Seconds\nhttps://youtu.be/eoFGKlZMo2g\n\nSee some great videos and documentaries from the PBS Digital Studios!\n\nIt's Okay to Be Smart: Your Salad Is Trying To Kill You\nhttps://youtu.be/8Ofgj2KDbfk\n\nIt's Okay to Be Smart: The Oldest Living Things In The World\nhttps://youtu.be/jgspUYDwnzQ\n\nFor more content from your local PBS and NPR affiliate:\nKQED Science: http://www.kqed.org/science\nTumblr: http://kqedscience.tumblr.com\nTwitter: https://www.twitter.com/kqedscience\n\nFunding for Deep Look is provided in part by PBS Digital Studios and the John S. and James L.

They have also been found under pines, and in Yosemite Valley under black oaks. \n\nWhy do death caps grow under trees?\nAs many fungi do, death cap mushrooms live off of trees, in what\u2019s called a mycorrhizal relationship. They send filaments deep down to the trees\u2019 roots, where they attach to the very thin root tips. The fungi absorb sugars from the trees and give them nutrients in exchange.\n\nWhere do California\u2019s death cap mushrooms come from? \nBiologist Anne Pringle, at the University of Wisconsin, Madison, has done research that shows that death caps likely snuck into California from Europe attached to the roots of imported plants, as early as 1938.\n\nHow deadly are death cap mushrooms? \nBetween 2010 and 2015, five people died in California and 57 became sick after eating the unassuming greenish mushrooms, according to the California Poison Control System. One mushroom cap is enough to kill a human being, and they\u2019re also poisonous to dogs. Death caps are believed to be the number one cause of fatal mushroom poisonings worldwide.\n\nWhat happens if you eat a death cap mushroom?\nA toxin in the mushroom destroys your liver cells. Dr. Kent Olson, co-medical director of the San Francisco Division of the California Poison Control System, said that for the first six to 12 hours after they eat the mushroom, victims of the death cap feel fine. During that time, a toxin in the mushroom is quietly injuring their liver cells. Patients then develop severe abdominal pain, diarrhea and vomiting. \u201cThey can become very rapidly dehydrated from the fluid losses,\u201d said Olson. Dehydration can cause kidney failure, which compounds the damage to the liver. For the most severe cases, the only way to save the patient is a liver transplant.\n\nFor more information on the death cap: \n\nBay Area Mycological Society\u2019s page with photos: http://bayareamushrooms.org/mushroommonth/amanita_phalloides.html\n\nRod Tulloss\u2019 detailed description: http://www.amanitaceae.org/?Amanita%20phalloides\n\n\nMore great Deep Look episodes:\nWhat Happens When You Zap Coral With The World's Most Powerful X-ray Laser?\nhttps://youtu.be/aXmCU6IYnsA\n\nThese 'Resurrection Plants' Spring Back to Life in Seconds\nhttps://youtu.be/eoFGKlZMo2g\n\nSee some great videos and documentaries from the PBS Digital Studios!\n\nIt's Okay to Be Smart: Your Salad Is Trying To Kill You\nhttps://youtu.be/8Ofgj2KDbfk\n\nIt's Okay to Be Smart: The Oldest Living Things In The World\nhttps://youtu.be/jgspUYDwnzQ\n\nFor more content from your local PBS and NPR affiliate:\nKQED Science: http://www.kqed.org/science\nTumblr: http://kqedscience.tumblr.com\nTwitter: https://www.twitter.com/kqedscience\n\nFunding for Deep Look is provided in part by PBS Digital Studios and the John S. and James L.

They are considered reptiles since they live in water. \n\n\nAre turtles endangered?\n\"There are only 300 species, and most of them are doing quite poorly.\" The turtles haven\u2019t been doing well in their native habitat in the western United States. In California, they\u2019re a species of \u201cspecial concern.\u201d\n\n\nWhy can turtles be raised in zoos?\nMost turtle species grow up without parents, which makes them easy to raise in zoos and help conservation. Once a female western pond turtle lays her eggs near a lake or pond, she never returns to the nest. Because they lack parental care, turtles don\u2019t imprint on zoo keepers.\n\n\nMore great Deep Look episodes:\n\nNature's Scuba Divers: How Beetles Breathe Underwater: \nhttps://youtu.be/T-RtG5Z-9jQ\n\nNature's Mood Rings: How Chameleons Really Change Color:\nhttps://youtu.be/Kp9W-_W8rCM\n\nNewt Sex: Buff Males!

But for threatened baby turtles raised in a zoo it\u2019s an advantage: they can learn to catch crickets all by themselves. There\u2019s a paradox, though.

They are considered reptiles since they live in water. \n\n\nAre turtles endangered?\n\"There are only 300 species, and most of them are doing quite poorly.\" The turtles haven\u2019t been doing well in their native habitat in the western United States. In California, they\u2019re a species of \u201cspecial concern.\u201d\n\n\nWhy can turtles be raised in zoos?\nMost turtle species grow up without parents, which makes them easy to raise in zoos and help conservation. Once a female western pond turtle lays her eggs near a lake or pond, she never returns to the nest. Because they lack parental care, turtles don\u2019t imprint on zoo keepers.\n\n\nMore great Deep Look episodes:\n\nNature's Scuba Divers: How Beetles Breathe Underwater: \nhttps://youtu.be/T-RtG5Z-9jQ\n\nNature's Mood Rings: How Chameleons Really Change Color:\nhttps://youtu.be/Kp9W-_W8rCM\n\nNewt Sex: Buff Males!

The pollen cones are relatively tiny. The seed cone gets to be much larger and takes three years to develop and release seeds so you can often see pine cones of three different stages of development on a single tree.\u201d\n\nWhy do pine cones open and close?\n\nEarly in their development, the scales open slightly for a short time to grant access to wind-borne pollen released from smaller pollen cones. After receiving the pollen, the female cones close back up until the seeds are fertilized and mature. Once they are, the scales reopen allowing the wind to disperse the winged seeds.\n\nWhat are the oldest living trees?\n\nConifers are some of the oldest plants in the forest. And they were once much more diverse than they are today. But since the evolution of flowering plants, their diversity has plummeted. Today only about 0.3 percent of all the species of seed plants have cones. Flowering plants have taken over most of the warmer, wetter habitats, pushing out the evergreen conifers.\n\nWhat are the tallest living trees?\nThe tallest (coast redwood), most massive (giant sequoia) and oldest living (bristlecone pine) individual organisms is the world are all conifers. \n\n\nMore great Deep Look episodes:\n\nThese 'Resurrection Plants' Spring Back to Life in Seconds | Deep Look:\nhttps://youtu.be/eoFGKlZMo2g\n\nThe Hidden Perils of Permafrost:\nhttps://youtu.be/wxABO84gol8\n\n\nSee also another great video from the PBS Digital Studios!\n\nIt's Okay to Be Smart:\nhttps://youtu.be/jgspUYDwnzQ\n\nBrainCraft:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr1dB86xE8o\n\n\nRead an extended article on pine cones:\nhttps://ww2.kqed.org/science/2015/11/24/the-sex-lives-of-christmas-trees/\n\nIf you\u2019re in the San Francisco Bay Area, You can check out the conifer collections at the University of California, Berkeley Jepson Herbarium:\nhttp://ucjeps.berkeley.edu/\n\nOr take a stroll through Tilden Regional Parks Botanic Garden to see a variety of California conifers:\nhttp://www.ebparks.org/page156.aspx\n\n\n\nKQED Science: http://www.kqed.org/science\nTumblr:  http://kqedscience.tumblr.com\nTwitter: https://www.twitter.com/kqedscience\n\nFunding for Deep Look is provided in part by PBS Digital Studios and the John S. and James L.

Meet nature\u2019s Scuba divers. They carry their air with them\u2014in some cases, for a lifetime. \n\nSUBSCRIBE to Deep Look!  http://goo.gl/8NwXqt\n\nDEEP LOOK: a new ultra-HD (4K) short video series created by KQED San Francisco and presented by PBS Digital Studios. See the unseen at the very edge of our visible world. Get a new perspective on our place in the universe and meet extraordinary new friends. Explore big scientific mysteries by going incredibly small.\n\n--- How do some insects breathe underwater?\n\nAir-breathing aquatic bugs and beetles don\u2019t hold their breath the way sea mammals do, nor do they have gills like fish.\n\nSo how do they do it? The answer lies in their small size. Insect scuba strategies hinge on a property of water that relative giants like us usually overlook: surface tension.\n\nPeople first crossed the line between land and sea to become scuba divers more than 70 years ago, when Jacques Cousteau pioneered the Aqua-Lung in Nazi-occupied France.\n\nBut some species of aquatic insects have been doing it for millions of years.\n\n\u201cWater beetles have been breathing underwater since before the dinosaurs existed,\u201d said Crystal Maier, an entomologist at The Field Museum in Chicago. \u201cIt has evolved at least 10 times across the insect tree of life.\u201d\n\n--- What is surface tension?\n\nSurface tension is the property of any liquid that describes how its particles stick together. In the case of water, surface tension is especially strong, enough to form a kind of film where it meets the air, whether at the surface or in a bubble.\n\nThe film is so strong, in fact, that a paper clip, which should sink because of its density, will float.\n\nSurface tension is a delicate force, vulnerable to changes temperature, turbulence or the introduction of contaminants, like soap. A sudden drop in surface tension can drown a whole insect community in an instant.\n\nThough it might not seem to affect our world to the same degree, surface tension is active all around us. It allows raindrops to form, trees to bring water to their leaves and ice to float. So in a sense, we too live on a thin boundary, ruled by the same subtle properties of water. \n\n--- How do beetles use surface tension to breathe underwater?\n\nIf you\u2019re a bug the size of a paperclip, in other words, surface tension makes a difference. Harnessing it, some aquatic beetles carry the oxygen they need underwater in the form of a temporary bubble, sort of like a natural scuba tank. Others encase themselves in a layer of air and draw oxygen from it their whole lives.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a pretty successful group of insects. They\u2019re on every continent, except Antarctica,\u201d said Cheryl Barr, collection manger emeritus at the Essig Museum of Entomology at UC Berkeley.\n\n--- Super videos from the PBS Digital Studios Network!\n\nSeven Surface Tension Experiments | Physics Girl\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WsksF...\n\nNature's Most Amazing Animal Superpowers | It's Okay to Be Smart\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e69ya...\n\nWhy Don\u2019t These Cicadas Have Butts? | Gross Science\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IDBkj...\n\nRead the full article on KQED Science:\n\nhttp://ww2.kqed.org/science/2015/11/10/natures-scuba-divers-how-beetles-breathe-underwater/\n\n--- More great DEEP LOOK episodes:\n\nHalloween Special: Watch Flesh-Eating Beetles Strip Bodies to the Bone\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Np0hJ...\n\nWhat Happens When You Put a Hummingbird in a Wind Tunnel?\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JyqY6...\n\nYou're Not Hallucinating.

                    "description": "Bugs and beetles can\u2019t hold their breath underwater like we do. But some aquatic insects can spend their whole adult lives underwater. How do they do it? Meet nature\u2019s Scuba divers. They carry their air with them\u2014in some cases, for a lifetime. \n\nSUBSCRIBE to Deep Look!  http://goo.gl/8NwXqt\n\nDEEP LOOK: a new ultra-HD (4K) short video series created by KQED San Francisco and presented by PBS Digital Studios.

Explore big scientific mysteries by going incredibly small.\n\n--- How do some insects breathe underwater?\n\nAir-breathing aquatic bugs and beetles don\u2019t hold their breath the way sea mammals do, nor do they have gills like fish.\n\nSo how do they do it? The answer lies in their small size. Insect scuba strategies hinge on a property of water that relative giants like us usually overlook: surface tension.\n\nPeople first crossed the line between land and sea to become scuba divers more than 70 years ago, when Jacques Cousteau pioneered the Aqua-Lung in Nazi-occupied France.\n\nBut some species of aquatic insects have been doing it for millions of years.\n\n\u201cWater beetles have been breathing underwater since before the dinosaurs existed,\u201d said Crystal Maier, an entomologist at The Field Museum in Chicago. \u201cIt has evolved at least 10 times across the insect tree of life.\u201d\n\n--- What is surface tension?\n\nSurface tension is the property of any liquid that describes how its particles stick together. In the case of water, surface tension is especially strong, enough to form a kind of film where it meets the air, whether at the surface or in a bubble.\n\nThe film is so strong, in fact, that a paper clip, which should sink because of its density, will float.\n\nSurface tension is a delicate force, vulnerable to changes temperature, turbulence or the introduction of contaminants, like soap. A sudden drop in surface tension can drown a whole insect community in an instant.\n\nThough it might not seem to affect our world to the same degree, surface tension is active all around us. It allows raindrops to form, trees to bring water to their leaves and ice to float. So in a sense, we too live on a thin boundary, ruled by the same subtle properties of water. \n\n--- How do beetles use surface tension to breathe underwater?\n\nIf you\u2019re a bug the size of a paperclip, in other words, surface tension makes a difference. Harnessing it, some aquatic beetles carry the oxygen they need underwater in the form of a temporary bubble, sort of like a natural scuba tank. Others encase themselves in a layer of air and draw oxygen from it their whole lives.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a pretty successful group of insects. They\u2019re on every continent, except Antarctica,\u201d said Cheryl Barr, collection manger emeritus at the Essig Museum of Entomology at UC Berkeley.\n\n--- Super videos from the PBS Digital Studios Network!\n\nSeven Surface Tension Experiments | Physics Girl\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WsksF...\n\nNature's Most Amazing Animal Superpowers | It's Okay to Be Smart\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e69ya...\n\nWhy Don\u2019t These Cicadas Have Butts? | Gross Science\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IDBkj...\n\nRead the full article on KQED Science:\n\nhttp://ww2.kqed.org/science/2015/11/10/natures-scuba-divers-how-beetles-breathe-underwater/\n\n--- More great DEEP LOOK episodes:\n\nHalloween Special: Watch Flesh-Eating Beetles Strip Bodies to the Bone\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Np0hJ...\n\nWhat Happens When You Put a Hummingbird in a Wind Tunnel?\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JyqY6...\n\nYou're Not Hallucinating.

Explore big scientific mysteries by going incredibly small.\n\n--- How do owls hunt silently?\n\nWhen birds flap their wings it creates turbulences in the air as it rushes over their wings. In general, the larger a bird is and the faster it flies, the larger the turbulence created and that means more sound. \n\nThe feathers at the leading edge of an owl\u2019s wings have an unusual serrated appearance, referred to as a comb or fringe. The tiny hooked projections stick out and break up the wind as it flows over the owl\u2019s wings reducing the size and sound of the turbulences.\n\nOwl feathers go one step further to control sound. When viewed up-close, owl feathers appear velvety. The furry texture absorbs and dampens sound like a sound blanket. It also allows the feathers to quietly slide past each other in flight, reducing rusting sounds.\n\n--- Why do owls hunt at night?\n\nOwls belong to a group called raptors which also so includes with hawks, eagles and falcons. Most of these birds of prey hunt during the day and rely on. But unlike most other raptors, the roughly 200 species of owl are generally nocturnal while others are crepuscular, meaning that they\u2019re active around dawn and dusk. \n\nThey have extremely powerful low-light vision, and finely tuned hearing which allows them to locate the source of even the smallest sound. Owls simply hide and wait for their prey to betray its own location. As ambush hunters, owls tend to rely on surprise more often than their ability to give chase.\n\n--- Why do owls hoot?\n\nWith Halloween around the corner, you might have noticed a familiar sound in the night. It\u2019s mating season for owls and the sound of their hooting fills the darkness. \n\nAccording to Chris Clark, an an assistant professor of biology at UC Riverside,, \u201cThe reason why owls are getting ready to breed right now in the late fall is because they breed earlier than most birds. The bigger the bird the longer it takes for them to incubate their eggs and for the nestlings to hatch out and or the fledglings to leave the nest.

And the work is not for the squeamish.\n\nWhat makes beetles ideal for cleaning museum specimens is that they\u2019re fast and fastidious eaters.  They can pick a carcass clean while leaving even the most delicate bone structures intact.\n\nIt takes a large beetle colony 24 \u2013 48 hours to clean the bones of small animals like rabbits and owls, and they can work on 100 - 200 specimens at a time.  Larger animals like deer or coyotes take about a week.   \n\nBut the alliance between beetles and museum is an uneasy one.  Downstairs the beetles are a critical tool. But if Dermestids got loose upstairs, they could wreak havoc in the library stacks, munching through specimen drawers and ruining entire collections.\n\n--- More KQED SCIENCE:\n\nTumblr:  http://kqedscience.tumblr.com\nTwitter: https://www.twitter.com/kqedscience\nKQED Science: http://ww2.kqed.org/science\n\n\n\n---\n\nMore great DEEP LOOK episodes:\n\nWhere Are the Ants Carrying All Those Leaves?\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6oKJ5FGk24\n\nWhat Happens When You Put a Hummingbird in a Wind Tunnel?\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JyqY64ovjfY\n\nPygmy Seahorses: Masters of Camouflage\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q3CtGoqz3ww\n\nRelated videos from the PBS Digital Studios Network!\n\nCan Microbes Solve Murder Mysteries? - Gross Science\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kRUt9pqMCSg\n\nThe Surprising Ways Death Shapes Our Lives - BrainCraft\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Joalg73L_gw\n\nDo Animals Mourn Their Dead? - It's Okay to Be Smart (ft.

                "description": "Chameleons don't change color to match their environment; it\u2019s just the opposite. How do they do it? By manipulating tiny crystals in their skin.  Now, UC Berkeley researchers are on a quest to create synthetic chameleon skin inspired by these reptiles\u2019 uncanny ability.\n\nDEEP LOOK: a new ultra-HD (4K) short video series created by KQED San Francisco and presented by PBS Digital Studios. See the unseen at the very edge of our visible world. Get a new perspective on our place in the universe and meet extraordinary new friends. Explore big scientific mysteries by going incredibly small.\n\n--- How do Chameleons Change Color?\n\nChameleons are some of the most brilliantly colored animals on the planet. But how did they evolve the ability to change color?\n\nScientists used to believe that chameleons changed color by spreading out pigments in their skin, much like octopuses or squid do.\n\nThe top layer of chameleon skin \u2013 called the epidermis \u2013 contains yellow pigment cells called xanthophores, and red pigment cells called erythrophores. But the amount of pigment in the cells stays the same, even when the chameleon changes color.\n\nJust beneath the chameleon\u2019s skin is a layer of cells called iridophores. These cells contain microscopic salt crystals, which are arranged in a three-dimensional pattern like oranges stacked on a fruit stand.\n\nWhen light hits the crystals, some wavelengths are absorbed and some are reflected. The result, to our eyes, is the beautiful rainbow of colors on the chameleon\u2019s skin. But what we\u2019re actually seeing is light that is bouncing off of these tiny crystals. What we perceive as green, for example, is blue wavelengths of light being reflected off the crystals and through the layer of yellow xanthophore cells in the chameleon\u2019s epidermis. The result is bright green skin that contains no green pigment!\n\nThe process of changing color is called metachrosis.\n\n--- Why do Chameleons Change Color?\n\nChameleons don\u2019t change color to match their environment. In fact, it\u2019s just the opposite.\n\nTheir baseline is camouflage.\n \nWhen chameleons are relaxed, they\u2019re mostly green. They naturally blend into their home in the forest canopy. They even mimic leaves by dancing around a little.\n\nBut when they feel threatened, annoyed, or just want to show a little swagger, that\u2019s when their color changes.\n \nScientists once thought that chameleons color-changing abilities allowed them to better camouflage themselves. Most species of chameleons live high in the forest canopy and their various shades of green provide natural camouflage. Even their movement provides camouflage \u2013 they dance around to mimic leaves blowing in the wind.\n\nIn fact, chameleons change color primarily to communicate with each other, as though they were living mood rings. Males will warn each other about their territory and females will change color to let males know whether they\u2019re interested in breeding.\n \nChameleons also have a second layer of iridiophore cells just beneath the first. The crystals in that layer are larger and reflect light waves in the infrared wavelengths. This suggests that chameleons are also changing colors to regulate their temperature, according to Milinkovitch. Chameleons are cold-blooded and heat their bodies with the warmth of the sun. \n\nRead the article  for this video on KQED Science:\nhttp://ww2.kqed.org/science/2015/08/25/natures-mood-rings-how-chameleons-really-change-color/\n\n\n--- More great DEEP LOOK episodes:\n\nWhere Are the Ants Carrying All Those Leaves?\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6oKJ5FGk24\n\nWhat Happens When You Put a Hummingbird in a Wind Tunnel?\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JyqY64ovjfY\n\nPygmy Seahorses: Masters of Camouflage\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q3CtGoqz3ww\n\n--- Related video from the PBS Digital Studios Network!\n\nNature's Most Amazing Animal Superpowers - It\u2019s Okay to be Smart\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e69yaWDkVGs\n\n\n--- Other Great Science Videos About Chameleons\n\nHow Do Chameleons Change Color? - Veritasium\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQggDnScsvI\n\nTrue Facts About The Chameleon - zefrank1\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UR_byRbXxvs\n\n--- More KQED SCIENCE:\n\nTumblr:  http://kqedscience.tumblr.com\nTwitter: https://www.twitter.com/kqedscience\nKQED Science: http://ww2.kqed.org/science\n\n\nFunding for Deep Look is provided in part by PBS Digital Studios and the John S. and James L.

                    "description": "Chameleons don't change color to match their environment; it\u2019s just the opposite. How do they do it? By manipulating tiny crystals in their skin.  Now, UC Berkeley researchers are on a quest to create synthetic chameleon skin inspired by these reptiles\u2019 uncanny ability.\n\nDEEP LOOK: a new ultra-HD (4K) short video series created by KQED San Francisco and presented by PBS Digital Studios. See the unseen at the very edge of our visible world. Get a new perspective on our place in the universe and meet extraordinary new friends. Explore big scientific mysteries by going incredibly small.\n\n--- How do Chameleons Change Color?\n\nChameleons are some of the most brilliantly colored animals on the planet. But how did they evolve the ability to change color?\n\nScientists used to believe that chameleons changed color by spreading out pigments in their skin, much like octopuses or squid do.\n\nThe top layer of chameleon skin \u2013 called the epidermis \u2013 contains yellow pigment cells called xanthophores, and red pigment cells called erythrophores. But the amount of pigment in the cells stays the same, even when the chameleon changes color.\n\nJust beneath the chameleon\u2019s skin is a layer of cells called iridophores. These cells contain microscopic salt crystals, which are arranged in a three-dimensional pattern like oranges stacked on a fruit stand.\n\nWhen light hits the crystals, some wavelengths are absorbed and some are reflected. The result, to our eyes, is the beautiful rainbow of colors on the chameleon\u2019s skin. But what we\u2019re actually seeing is light that is bouncing off of these tiny crystals. What we perceive as green, for example, is blue wavelengths of light being reflected off the crystals and through the layer of yellow xanthophore cells in the chameleon\u2019s epidermis. The result is bright green skin that contains no green pigment!\n\nThe process of changing color is called metachrosis.\n\n--- Why do Chameleons Change Color?\n\nChameleons don\u2019t change color to match their environment. In fact, it\u2019s just the opposite.\n\nTheir baseline is camouflage.\n \nWhen chameleons are relaxed, they\u2019re mostly green. They naturally blend into their home in the forest canopy. They even mimic leaves by dancing around a little.\n\nBut when they feel threatened, annoyed, or just want to show a little swagger, that\u2019s when their color changes.\n \nScientists once thought that chameleons color-changing abilities allowed them to better camouflage themselves. Most species of chameleons live high in the forest canopy and their various shades of green provide natural camouflage. Even their movement provides camouflage \u2013 they dance around to mimic leaves blowing in the wind.\n\nIn fact, chameleons change color primarily to communicate with each other, as though they were living mood rings. Males will warn each other about their territory and females will change color to let males know whether they\u2019re interested in breeding.\n \nChameleons also have a second layer of iridiophore cells just beneath the first. The crystals in that layer are larger and reflect light waves in the infrared wavelengths. This suggests that chameleons are also changing colors to regulate their temperature, according to Milinkovitch. Chameleons are cold-blooded and heat their bodies with the warmth of the sun. \n\nRead the article  for this video on KQED Science:\nhttp://ww2.kqed.org/science/2015/08/25/natures-mood-rings-how-chameleons-really-change-color/\n\n\n--- More great DEEP LOOK episodes:\n\nWhere Are the Ants Carrying All Those Leaves?\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6oKJ5FGk24\n\nWhat Happens When You Put a Hummingbird in a Wind Tunnel?\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JyqY64ovjfY\n\nPygmy Seahorses: Masters of Camouflage\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q3CtGoqz3ww\n\n--- Related video from the PBS Digital Studios Network!\n\nNature's Most Amazing Animal Superpowers - It\u2019s Okay to be Smart\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e69yaWDkVGs\n\n\n--- Other Great Science Videos About Chameleons\n\nHow Do Chameleons Change Color? - Veritasium\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQggDnScsvI\n\nTrue Facts About The Chameleon - zefrank1\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UR_byRbXxvs\n\n--- More KQED SCIENCE:\n\nTumblr:  http://kqedscience.tumblr.com\nTwitter: https://www.twitter.com/kqedscience\nKQED Science: http://ww2.kqed.org/science\n\n\nFunding for Deep Look is provided in part by PBS Digital Studios and the John S. and James L.

Tiny swarming robots--called Kilobots--work together to tackle tasks in the lab, but what can they teach us about the natural world?\n\n\u2193 More info, videos,  and sources below \u2193\n\nDEEP LOOK: a new ultra-HD (4K) short video series created by KQED San Francisco and presented by PBS Digital Studios.

The question may seem like science fiction, but it\u2019s one that has challenged real robotics engineers for decades.\n\nIn 2010, the Kilobot entered the scene. Now, engineers are programming these tiny independent robots to cooperate on group tasks. This research could one day lead to robots that can assemble themselves  into machines, or provide insights into how swarming behaviors emerge in nature.\n\nIn the future, this kind of research might lead to collaborative robots that could self-assemble into a composite structure. This larger robot could work in dangerous or contaminated areas, like cleaning up oil spills or conducting search-and-rescue activities.\n\nWhat is Emergent Behavior?\n\nThe universe tends towards chaos, but sometimes patterns emerge, like a flock of birds in flight. Like termites building skyscrapers out of mud, or fish schooling to avoid predators.\n\nIt\u2019s called emergent behavior. Complex behaviors that arise from interactions between simple things. And you don\u2019t just see it in nature.\n\nWhat\u2019s so interesting about kilobots is that individually, they\u2019re pretty dumb.\n\nThey\u2019re designed to be simple. A single kilobot can do maybe... three things: Respond to light. Measure a distance, sense the presence of other kilobots.  \n\nBut these are swarm robots. They work together.\n\nHow do Kilobots work?\n\nKilobots were designed by Michael Rubenstein, a research scientist in the Self Organizing Systems Research Group at Harvard. Each robot consists of about $15 worth of parts: a microprocessor that is about as smart as a calculator, sensors for visible and infrared light, and two tiny cell-phone vibration units that allow it to move across a table. They are powered by a rechargeable lithium-ion battery, like those found in small electronics or watches.\n\nThe kilobots are programed all at once, as a group, using infrared light. Each kilobot gets the same set of instructions as the next. With just a few lines of programming, the kilobots, together, can act out complex natural processes.\n\nThe same kinds of simple instructions that kilobots use to self-assemble into shapes can make them mimic natural swarming behaviors, too. For example, kilobots can sync their flashing lights like a swarm of fireflies, differentiate similar to cells in an embryo and follow a scent trail like foraging ants.\n\nRead the article  for this video on KQED Science:\nhttps://ww2.kqed.org/science/2015/07/21/can-a-thousand-tiny-swarming-robots-outsmart-nature\n\n\nMore great DEEP LOOK episodes:\n\nWhere Are the Ants Carrying All Those Leaves?\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6oKJ5FGk24\n\nWhat Happens When You Put a Hummingbird in a Wind Tunnel?\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JyqY64ovjfY\n\nPygmy Seahorses: Masters of Camouflage\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q3CtGoqz3ww\n\nRelated videos from the PBS Digital Studios Network!\n\nIs Ultron Inevitable? |  It\u2019s Okay to Be Smart\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Irmtk5QG8s\n\nA History Of Robots | The Good Stuff\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TK-h4oATYSI\n\nWhen Will We Worry About the Well-Being of Robots? | Idea Channel https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FLieeAUQWMs\n\n\nFunding for Deep Look is provided in part by PBS Digital Studios and the John S. and James L.

                    "description": "How does a group of animals -- or cells, for that matter -- work together when no one\u2019s in charge? Tiny swarming robots--called Kilobots--work together to tackle tasks in the lab, but what can they teach us about the natural world?\n\n\u2193 More info, videos,  and sources below \u2193\n\nDEEP LOOK: a new ultra-HD (4K) short video series created by KQED San Francisco and presented by PBS Digital Studios.

The question may seem like science fiction, but it\u2019s one that has challenged real robotics engineers for decades.\n\nIn 2010, the Kilobot entered the scene. Now, engineers are programming these tiny independent robots to cooperate on group tasks. This research could one day lead to robots that can assemble themselves  into machines, or provide insights into how swarming behaviors emerge in nature.\n\nIn the future, this kind of research might lead to collaborative robots that could self-assemble into a composite structure. This larger robot could work in dangerous or contaminated areas, like cleaning up oil spills or conducting search-and-rescue activities.\n\nWhat is Emergent Behavior?\n\nThe universe tends towards chaos, but sometimes patterns emerge, like a flock of birds in flight. Like termites building skyscrapers out of mud, or fish schooling to avoid predators.\n\nIt\u2019s called emergent behavior. Complex behaviors that arise from interactions between simple things. And you don\u2019t just see it in nature.\n\nWhat\u2019s so interesting about kilobots is that individually, they\u2019re pretty dumb.\n\nThey\u2019re designed to be simple. A single kilobot can do maybe... three things: Respond to light. Measure a distance, sense the presence of other kilobots.  \n\nBut these are swarm robots. They work together.\n\nHow do Kilobots work?\n\nKilobots were designed by Michael Rubenstein, a research scientist in the Self Organizing Systems Research Group at Harvard. Each robot consists of about $15 worth of parts: a microprocessor that is about as smart as a calculator, sensors for visible and infrared light, and two tiny cell-phone vibration units that allow it to move across a table. They are powered by a rechargeable lithium-ion battery, like those found in small electronics or watches.\n\nThe kilobots are programed all at once, as a group, using infrared light. Each kilobot gets the same set of instructions as the next. With just a few lines of programming, the kilobots, together, can act out complex natural processes.\n\nThe same kinds of simple instructions that kilobots use to self-assemble into shapes can make them mimic natural swarming behaviors, too. For example, kilobots can sync their flashing lights like a swarm of fireflies, differentiate similar to cells in an embryo and follow a scent trail like foraging ants.\n\nRead the article  for this video on KQED Science:\nhttps://ww2.kqed.org/science/2015/07/21/can-a-thousand-tiny-swarming-robots-outsmart-nature\n\n\nMore great DEEP LOOK episodes:\n\nWhere Are the Ants Carrying All Those Leaves?\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6oKJ5FGk24\n\nWhat Happens When You Put a Hummingbird in a Wind Tunnel?\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JyqY64ovjfY\n\nPygmy Seahorses: Masters of Camouflage\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q3CtGoqz3ww\n\nRelated videos from the PBS Digital Studios Network!\n\nIs Ultron Inevitable? |  It\u2019s Okay to Be Smart\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Irmtk5QG8s\n\nA History Of Robots | The Good Stuff\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TK-h4oATYSI\n\nWhen Will We Worry About the Well-Being of Robots? | Idea Channel https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FLieeAUQWMs\n\n\nFunding for Deep Look is provided in part by PBS Digital Studios and the John S. and James L.

Explore big scientific mysteries by going incredibly small.\n\nIs coral a plant or animal?\n\nCorals are unusual creatures. They are actually a partnership- or symbiosis- between an animal (a polyp) and a plant (algae) in which they work together to survive and thrive.\n\nHow does coral grow?\n\nTiny animals called polyps form an exoskeleton to live in. When one polyp dies, another builds a new home right on top of the old one. Beneath lies the abandoned exoskeletons, like an ancient city made of layer upon layer of old dwellings.\n\nWhat is coral made of?\n\nCoral exoskeletons are mostly made of calcium carbonate. But sometimes the polyps incorporate tiny amounts of other elements from the surrounding water, including the element strontium. Biologists don\u2019t fully understand why polyps absorb strontium, but it\u2019s a phenomenon that happens consistently across the world\u2019s oceans.\n\nWhen sea surface temperatures are warmer, corals absorb less strontium into their exoskeletons. When they are colder, they absorb more. By comparing the strontium-to-calcium ratio over time, scientists are able to reconstruct sea surface temperatures from the past. They also can chart long-term climate cycles that occurred over the lifespan of the coral. Since these corals can live for over 500 years, this gives us insights into the weather hundreds of years before written scientific records. \n\nRead the article for this video on KQED Science:\nhttp://ww2.kqed.org/science/2015/07/07/what-happens-when-you-zap-coral-with-the-worlds-most-powerful-x-ray-laser/\n--\n\nMore great Deep Look episodes:\n\nWhere Are the Ants Carrying All Those Leaves? \nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6oKJ5FGk24\n\nWhat Happens When You Put a Hummingbird in a Wind Tunnel?\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JyqY64ovjfY\n\nPygmy Seahorses: Masters of Camouflage \nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q3CtGoqz3ww\n\nSee also another great video from the PBS Digital Studios!\n\nIt\u2019s Okay to Be Smart: The Oldest Living Things In The World\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgspUYDwnzQ\n\nMore KQED Science:\n\nTumblr:  http://kqedscience.tumblr.com\nTwitter: https://www.twitter.com/kqedscience\nKQED Science: http://ww2.kqed.org/science\n\nFunding for Deep Look is provided in part by PBS Digital Studios and the John S. and James L.

Their success as farmers has made leafcutter ants into fungus tycoons, complete with their own underground cities and huge half-inch soldiers to patrol them.\n\nDEEP LOOK: a new ultra-HD (4K) short video series created by KQED San Francisco and presented by PBS Digital Studios. See the unseen at the very edge of our visible world. Get a new perspective on our place in the universe and meet extraordinary new friends. Explore big scientific mysteries by going incredibly small.\n\nWhat do ants eat?\n\nThough leafcutter ants drink the sap in leaves for energy, they don\u2019t eat them. Instead, they use them to grow something else. Leafcutters use leaf pieces to feed a fungus that grows in white tufts in their nests. The ants eat the fungus and feed it to their brood.\n\nHow old are ants? \n\nTo give you an idea, while humans have farmed for around 12,000 years, ants have been doing it for 60 million. \n\nHow many ants are there in the world?\n\nIf you bundled together all the ants in the world, there would be more of them than people \u2013 they\u2019re the dominant biomass, says Brian Fisher, chair of the Department of Entomology at the California Academy of Sciences, in San Francisco. This is because all 30,000 species of ants are social. They have many ways of making a living.\n\nHow strong are ants?\n\nLeafcutter ants haul leaf pieces through fields or forests to their underground nests. For a human, this feat would be the equivalent of carrying more than 600 pounds between our teeth. \n\nWhy are ants important to the soil?\n\nThe activity of ants aerates the soil, making it easier for water and oxygen to get through.

After that, males are no longer necessary: Leafcutter colonies are made up entirely of female ants.\n\nKQED Science: http://ww2.kqed.org/science\nTumblr:  http://kqedscience.tumblr.com\nTwitter: https://www.twitter.com/kqedscience\n\nFunding for Deep Look is provided in part by PBS Digital Studios and the John S. and James L.

Explore big scientific mysteries by going incredibly small.\n\nHow do hummingbirds eat?\n\nWith spring in full bloom, hummingbirds can be spotted flitting from flower to flower and lapping up the sugary nectar inside. These tiniest of birds have the highest metabolism of any warm-blooded animal, requiring them to consume their own body weight in nectar each day to survive.\n\nBy comparison, if a 150-pound human had the metabolism of a hummingbird, he or she would need to consume the caloric equivalent of more than 300 hamburgers a day.\n\nBut it's not just an extreme appetite that sets hummingbirds apart from other birds. These avian acrobats are the only birds that can fly sideways, backwards and hover for long stretches of time. In fact, hovering is essential to hummingbirds' survival since they have to keep their long, thin beaks as steady as a surgeon's scalpel while probing flowers for nectar.\n\nHow do Hummingbirds fly?\n\nHummingbirds don't just hover to feed when the weather is nice. They have to keep hovering and feeding even if it's windy or raining, a remarkable feat considering most of these birds weigh less than a nickel.\n\nMore great Deep Look episodes:\n\nNewt Sex: Buff Males!

Their mating ritual is a raucous affair that involves bulked-up males, writhing females and a little cannibalism.\n\nSUBSCRIBE: http://goo.gl/8NwXqt\n\nThese amphibious creatures are about five to eight inches long, with rust-colored skin, except for their bright yellow eyes and belly. They began to arrive at the UC Botanical Garden around November, and will stay here for the duration of the rainy season, usually through the end of March.\n\nWhile California newts (Taricha torosa) are only about six inches long, they might travel as far as three miles to return to their birthplace. That's the equivalent for a human of walking about a marathon and a half, without any signs or road maps. Scientists aren't sure exactly how they find their way, but they think it might be based on smell.\n\nWhy do newts live in a pond?  California Newts live most of their time in the forest, but mate in the pond where they were born.\n\nFunding for Deep Look is provided in part by PBS Digital Studios and the John S. and James L.

                    "description": "Every winter, California newts leave the safety of their forest burrows and travel as far as three miles to mate in the pond where they were born. Their mating ritual is a raucous affair that involves bulked-up males, writhing females and a little cannibalism.\n\nSUBSCRIBE: http://goo.gl/8NwXqt\n\nThese amphibious creatures are about five to eight inches long, with rust-colored skin, except for their bright yellow eyes and belly. They began to arrive at the UC Botanical Garden around November, and will stay here for the duration of the rainy season, usually through the end of March.\n\nWhile California newts (Taricha torosa) are only about six inches long, they might travel as far as three miles to return to their birthplace. That's the equivalent for a human of walking about a marathon and a half, without any signs or road maps. Scientists aren't sure exactly how they find their way, but they think it might be based on smell.\n\nWhy do newts live in a pond?  California Newts live most of their time in the forest, but mate in the pond where they were born.\n\nFunding for Deep Look is provided in part by PBS Digital Studios and the John S. and James L.

Explore big scientific mysteries by going incredibly small.\n\n* NEW VIDEOS EVERY OTHER TUESDAY! *\n\n \u201cWhat nerve!\u201d you might say. What\u2026 gall! And you\u2019d be right. The wasps are called gall-inducers. \n\n---+ What do oak galls look like?\n\nIf you\u2019ve ever spent a Summer or Fall around oak trees \u2013 such as the stalwart Valley Oak \u2013 Quercus lobata, or the stately Blue Oak, Quercus douglasii \u2013 you may be familiar with the large, vaguely fruity-looking objects clinging to the branches and leaves. Commonly called oak apples, these growths are the last thing you\u2019d want to put in your mouth. They are intensely bitter, loaded with tannin compounds \u2013 the same compounds that in modest amounts give red wine its pleasant dryness, and tea its refreshing earthy tang. \n\nThat said, the oak apple\u2019s powerful astringency has been prized for millennia. Tanning leather, making ink or dye, and cleaning wounds have been but a few of the gall\u2019s historical uses.\n\nBut on closer inspection of these oaks \u2013 and many other plants and trees such as willows, alders, manzanitas, or pines \u2013 you can find a rogue\u2019s gallery of smaller galls. Carefully peeking under leaves, along the stems and branches, or around the flower buds and acorns will likely lead you to unexpected finds. Smooth ones. Spiky ones. Long skinny ones, flat ones, lumpy, boxy ones. From the size of a golf ball down to that of a poppy seed. These structures wear shades of yellow, green, brown, purple, pink and red \u2013 and sometimes all of the above. A single tree may be host to dozens of types of gall, each one caused by a specific organism. And their shapes range from the sublime to the downright creepy. One tree may be encrusted with them, like a Christmas tree laden with ornaments and tinsel; and the next tree over may be almost completely free of galls. Why? It\u2019s a mystery.\n\n---+ How do oak galls form?\n\nGalls are generally formed when an insect, or its larvae, introduce chemicals into a specific location, to push the plant\u2019s growth hormones into overdrive. This can result in a great profusion of normal cells, increased size of existing cells, or the alteration of entire plant structures into new, alien forms.\n\nLots of creatures cause them; midges, mites, aphids, flies, even bacteria and viruses. But the undisputed champs are a big family of little wasps called Cynipids\u2013 rarely exceeding the size of a mosquito, a quarter of an inch in length.\n\n\u201cThese tiny wasps cannot sting,\u201d says Dr. Kathy Schick, Assistant Specialist/Curatorial Assistant at the Essig Museum of Entomology at UC Berkeley. \u201cGall-inducers are fascinating in that they are very specialized to their organ of the host plant.\u201d\n\n---+ What are oak galls?\n\nThese wasp houses are not homes exactly, but more akin to nurseries. The galls serve as an ideal environment for wasp larvae, whether it is a single offspring, or dozens. The tree is tricked into generating outsize amounts of soft, pillowy tissue inside each gall, on which the larvae gladly gorge themselves as they grow.\n\n\nFull article: http://blogs.kqed.org/science/2014/11/18/what-gall-the-crazy-cribs-of-parasitic-wasps/\n\n---+ See more great videos and documentaries from the PBS Digital Studios!\n\nIt's Okay to Be Smart: Inside the World of Fire Ants!\nhttps://youtu.be/rz3UdLEWQ60\n\nGross Science: Can Spider Venom Cure Erectile Dysfunction?\nhttps://youtu.be/5i9X8h17VNM\n\n---+ More Great Deep Look episodes:\n\nThese Lizards Have Been Playing Rock-Paper-Scissors for 15 Million Years\nhttps://youtu.be/rafdHxBwIbQ\n\nStinging Scorpion vs. Pain-Defying Mouse\nhttps://youtu.be/w-K_YtWqMro\n\n---+ Follow KQED Science:\n\nKQED Science: http://www.kqed.org/science\nTumblr: http://kqedscience.tumblr.com\nTwitter: https://www.twitter.com/kqedscience\n\n---+ About KQED\n\nKQED, an NPR and PBS affiliate in San Francisco, CA, serves Northern California and beyond with a public-supported alternative to commercial TV, Radio and web media.\n\nFunding for Deep Look is provided in part by PBS Digital Studios and the John S. and James L.

The wasps are called gall-inducers. \n\n---+ What do oak galls look like?\n\nIf you\u2019ve ever spent a Summer or Fall around oak trees \u2013 such as the stalwart Valley Oak \u2013 Quercus lobata, or the stately Blue Oak, Quercus douglasii \u2013 you may be familiar with the large, vaguely fruity-looking objects clinging to the branches and leaves. Commonly called oak apples, these growths are the last thing you\u2019d want to put in your mouth. They are intensely bitter, loaded with tannin compounds \u2013 the same compounds that in modest amounts give red wine its pleasant dryness, and tea its refreshing earthy tang. \n\nThat said, the oak apple\u2019s powerful astringency has been prized for millennia. Tanning leather, making ink or dye, and cleaning wounds have been but a few of the gall\u2019s historical uses.\n\nBut on closer inspection of these oaks \u2013 and many other plants and trees such as willows, alders, manzanitas, or pines \u2013 you can find a rogue\u2019s gallery of smaller galls. Carefully peeking under leaves, along the stems and branches, or around the flower buds and acorns will likely lead you to unexpected finds. Smooth ones. Spiky ones. Long skinny ones, flat ones, lumpy, boxy ones. From the size of a golf ball down to that of a poppy seed. These structures wear shades of yellow, green, brown, purple, pink and red \u2013 and sometimes all of the above. A single tree may be host to dozens of types of gall, each one caused by a specific organism. And their shapes range from the sublime to the downright creepy. One tree may be encrusted with them, like a Christmas tree laden with ornaments and tinsel; and the next tree over may be almost completely free of galls. Why? It\u2019s a mystery.\n\n---+ How do oak galls form?\n\nGalls are generally formed when an insect, or its larvae, introduce chemicals into a specific location, to push the plant\u2019s growth hormones into overdrive. This can result in a great profusion of normal cells, increased size of existing cells, or the alteration of entire plant structures into new, alien forms.\n\nLots of creatures cause them; midges, mites, aphids, flies, even bacteria and viruses. But the undisputed champs are a big family of little wasps called Cynipids\u2013 rarely exceeding the size of a mosquito, a quarter of an inch in length.\n\n\u201cThese tiny wasps cannot sting,\u201d says Dr. Kathy Schick, Assistant Specialist/Curatorial Assistant at the Essig Museum of Entomology at UC Berkeley. \u201cGall-inducers are fascinating in that they are very specialized to their organ of the host plant.\u201d\n\n---+ What are oak galls?\n\nThese wasp houses are not homes exactly, but more akin to nurseries. The galls serve as an ideal environment for wasp larvae, whether it is a single offspring, or dozens. The tree is tricked into generating outsize amounts of soft, pillowy tissue inside each gall, on which the larvae gladly gorge themselves as they grow.\n\n\nFull article: http://blogs.kqed.org/science/2014/11/18/what-gall-the-crazy-cribs-of-parasitic-wasps/\n\n---+ See more great videos and documentaries from the PBS Digital Studios!\n\nIt's Okay to Be Smart: Inside the World of Fire Ants!\nhttps://youtu.be/rz3UdLEWQ60\n\nGross Science: Can Spider Venom Cure Erectile Dysfunction?\nhttps://youtu.be/5i9X8h17VNM\n\n---+ More Great Deep Look episodes:\n\nThese Lizards Have Been Playing Rock-Paper-Scissors for 15 Million Years\nhttps://youtu.be/rafdHxBwIbQ\n\nStinging Scorpion vs. Pain-Defying Mouse\nhttps://youtu.be/w-K_YtWqMro\n\n---+ Follow KQED Science:\n\nKQED Science: http://www.kqed.org/science\nTumblr: http://kqedscience.tumblr.com\nTwitter: https://www.twitter.com/kqedscience\n\n---+ About KQED\n\nKQED, an NPR and PBS affiliate in San Francisco, CA, serves Northern California and beyond with a public-supported alternative to commercial TV, Radio and web media.\n\nFunding for Deep Look is provided in part by PBS Digital Studios and the John S. and James L.

In particular, Barnard wants to understand why beaches just south of San Francisco Bay are among the most rapidly eroding beaches in the state.\n\nFrom 2010-2012, Barnard and his team sampled beaches, outcrops, rivers and creeks to track sand\u2019s journey around the bay. They even collected sand from the ocean floor. The researchers then carefully analyzed the samples to characterize the shapes, sizes, and chemical properties of the sand grains.\n\nBarnard said the information provides a kind of fingerprint, or signature, for each sample that can then be matched to a potential source. For example, certain minerals may only come from the Sierra Mountains or the Marin Headlands.\n\n\u201cIf we\u2019ve covered all of the potential sources, and we know the unique signature of the sand from these different sources, and we find it on a beach somewhere, then we basically know where it came from,\u201d explained Barnard.\n\nAnd those species aren\u2019t the only things finding their way into the sand. Manmade materials can show up there, too. McGann has found metal welding scraps and tiny glass spheres (commonly sprinkled on highways to make road stripes reflective) in sand samples from around the bay.\n\n\u201cAll of these things can get washed into our rivers or our creeks, or washed off the road in storm drains,\u201d explained McGann. \u201cEventually they end up in, for example, San Francisco Bay.\u201d\n\nBy piecing together all of these clues \u2013 the information found in the minerals, biological material and man made objects that make up sand \u2013 the researchers ended up with a pretty clear picture of how sand travels around San Francisco Bay.\n\nSome sands stay close to home. Rocky sand in the Marin Headlands comes from nearby bluffs, never straying far from its source.\n\nOther sands travel hundreds of miles. Granite from the Sierra Nevada mountains careens down rivers and streams on a century-long sojourn to the coast.\n\nIn fact, much of the sand in the Bay Area comes from the Sacramento and San Joaquin rivers, with local watersheds also playing an important role in transporting sand to the beach.\n\nAlthough this project focused on San Francisco Bay, the same techniques could be used to study other coastal systems, he added, revealing the incredible life stories of sand from around the world. \n\n---+ More Deep Look episodes:\n\nWhat Happens When You Zap Coral With The World's Most Powerful X-ray Laser?\nhttps://youtu.be/aXmCU6IYnsA\n\nThese 'Resurrection Plants' Spring Back to Life in Seconds\nhttps://youtu.be/eoFGKlZMo2g\n\n--\nFull article: http://blogs.kqed.org/science/2014/11/04/the-amazing-life-of-sand/\n\n---+ Follow KQED Science:\n\nKQED Science: http://www.kqed.org/science\nTumblr: http://kqedscience.tumblr.com\nTwitter: https://www.twitter.com/kqedscience\n\n---+ About KQED\n\nKQED, an NPR and PBS affiliate in San Francisco, CA, serves Northern California and beyond with a public-supported alternative to commercial TV, Radio and web media.\n\nFunding for Deep Look is provided in part by PBS Digital Studios and the John S. and James L.

The seahorses use their long tails to grab on to the delicately branched sea fans. But what\u2019s really amazing is their ability to match the coral\u2019s bright color and knobby texture. They blend in so perfectly that they are barely visible, even to a trained eye.\n\nPygmy seahorses are nearly impossible to raise in captivity. Until recently, there was no record of the seahorses ever living long enough to breed in an aquarium. As a result, very little is known about them, making them extremely attractive to researchers eager to learn about the mysterious species.\n\nThe Gorgonian sea fan is itself an animal, distantly related to jellyfish and anemones, and is very difficult to raise in tanks. But these seahorses cannot live without the them. \n\nHow do seahorses mate?\n\nThey do a courtship dance during which the female puts her eggs in the males brood pouch.\n\nHow do seahorses give birth?\n\nLike other seahorses, it is the male pygmy that rears the offspring in his brood pouch, releasing groups of offspring every two weeks.  \n\nCheck out an additional video from the Cal Academy: http://goo.gl/QhAf0T\n\nFind out more about pygmy seahorses: \n\nhttp://blogs.kqed.org/science/2014/10/21/pygmy-seahorses-masters-of-camouflage/\n\nCreated by KQED Public Media in San Francisco and presented by PBS Digital Studios.\n\nFunding for Deep Look is provided in part by PBS Digital Studios and the John S. and James L.

                    "description": "Tiny and delicate, pygmy seahorses survive by attaching to vibrant corals where they become nearly invisible to both predators and researchers. Now, biologists at the California Academy of Sciences have successfully bred them in captivity for the first time. Finally, they're able to study the seahorses' amazing act of camouflage up close. \n\nSUBSCRIBE to Deep Look! http://goo.gl/8NwXqt\n\nDEEP LOOK: a new ultra-HD (4K) short video series created by KQED San Francisco and presented by PBS Digital Studios. See the unseen at the very edge of our visible world. Get a new perspective on our place in the universe and meet extraordinary new friends. Explore big scientific mysteries by going incredibly small.\n\n* NEW VIDEOS EVERY OTHER TUESDAY! *\n\nOver the summer, biologists from the California Academy of Sciences in San Francisco returned from an expedition to the Philippines with some very rare and diminutive guests, a mating pair of pygmy seahorses. \n\nPygmy seahorses live their entire adult lives attached to a type of coral called a Gorgonian sea fan. The seahorses use their long tails to grab on to the delicately branched sea fans. But what\u2019s really amazing is their ability to match the coral\u2019s bright color and knobby texture. They blend in so perfectly that they are barely visible, even to a trained eye.\n\nPygmy seahorses are nearly impossible to raise in captivity. Until recently, there was no record of the seahorses ever living long enough to breed in an aquarium. As a result, very little is known about them, making them extremely attractive to researchers eager to learn about the mysterious species.\n\nThe Gorgonian sea fan is itself an animal, distantly related to jellyfish and anemones, and is very difficult to raise in tanks. But these seahorses cannot live without the them. \n\nHow do seahorses mate?\n\nThey do a courtship dance during which the female puts her eggs in the males brood pouch.\n\nHow do seahorses give birth?\n\nLike other seahorses, it is the male pygmy that rears the offspring in his brood pouch, releasing groups of offspring every two weeks.  \n\nCheck out an additional video from the Cal Academy: http://goo.gl/QhAf0T\n\nFind out more about pygmy seahorses: \n\nhttp://blogs.kqed.org/science/2014/10/21/pygmy-seahorses-masters-of-camouflage/\n\nCreated by KQED Public Media in San Francisco and presented by PBS Digital Studios.\n\nFunding for Deep Look is provided in part by PBS Digital Studios and the John S. and James L.
