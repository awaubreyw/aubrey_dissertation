The toilet cleaner makes them sink faster. <br>The reason I say a toilet and not a cup or bowl is because these little b*st*sds don&#39;t properly drown for 7 to 12 hours. Try it, drown them and then take them out the water and watch them wake up. <br>Hoover, everyday. They like skirting boards, check under the carpet against walls, hoover and wash anything the cat has laid its infested backside on. Then empty the hoover, everytime you&#39;ve used it. Even outside.
