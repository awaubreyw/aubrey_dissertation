Mantis shrimp have compound eyes which are made up of up to 10000 single eyes (ommatidia). The word hexnocular suggest only six eyes and while the term is also used in different sources it would have been vitaly important to clarify that those are modified compound eyes. Furthermore the video says that &quot;the black spots in the eyes, work just like human pupils&quot; which is just flat out wrong. The black spots that you can see in compound eyes are the dark pigments of the ommatidia which the observer is direktly looking into (which only works at a direct angle) because of the angle you cannot see the pigment in the remaining Omatidia resulting in the illusion of a dark spot following the observer. The pupil of a human eye has a completely different function and structure and should therefore not be compaired to this penomenon.\r<br>I really dont want to be nitpicky but it annoys me to see something like this in your videos which are usually very well researched. The real tragedy is that in a educational video primarily about the eyes of the mantis shrimp you managed to not only leave out a vital part of its anatomy, you also made statements which directly lead to false assumtions for the viewers (especially unexperienced). This is a real shame because most of these people will probably never question what they heard in the video and thereby miss out on the truth of the 10000 eyes of the mantis shrimp (which is obviously way cooler than 6 eyes). Finally I know that this is a old video and  probably nobody will read this but I would very much appreciate it if you could add in a popup in the video (youtube has this function) or something that clarifies the compound nature of these magnificent eyes.", "comment_date": "2020-07-01T21:40:16Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "CharlieCCC", "comment_text": "So i guess sand is like water for sea animals, the sea is like air, and the air like space?", "comment_date": "2020-06-29T22:26:15Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "NuclearDino", "comment_text": "Who will win between them", "comment_date": "2020-06-28T19:40:47Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "b e e a u t i e", "comment_text": "the thumbnail tho IRHWIENWKD", "comment_date": "2020-06-28T06:45:12Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "RobinDoggy", "comment_text": "Fish of the North Star", "comment_date": "2020-06-27T16:46:56Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Omair Sheikh", "comment_text": "Even a colourblind mantis shrimp has better eyes than us", "comment_date": "2020-06-25T18:59:47Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Moses Chong", "comment_text": "Mike tyson&#39;s spirit animal", "comment_date": "2020-06-24T08:24:21Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Pastel Ghoul", "comment_text": "I have one as a pet", "comment_date": "2020-06-23T20:12:23Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Twin Mill 101", "comment_text": "Mantis shrimp = one punch man of the ocean", "comment_date": "2020-06-22T18:02:41Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Seventeen The Pheonix", "comment_text": "<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lm1ChtK9QDU&amp;t=2m28s\">2:28</a> <br>Red: HEY DONT YOU TRY TO STEAL MY HOUSE THIEF GET OUT NOW!<br><br>White: but I&#39;m your friend and I&#39;m here for a play dat-<br><br>Red: I DONT CARE!<br><br>White: Ok, if you wanna play rough, I&#39;ll play rough.<br><br>Red: FINE.

All facets of each compound eye take in light simultaneously from their respective directions.
