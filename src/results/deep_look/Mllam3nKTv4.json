A lot of studies suggest this and they measure the effects of sleep and different influences in people who are already conditioned in this way, aligned with the structure and routine of our society.  Obviously throwing off somebody&#39;s sleep cycle, which happens to align with sunrise or sunset more or less, reeks havoc.  There was a study that isolated people from light and time for an extended period of time and they found that people&#39;s internal clocks were conditioned closer to 25 hour cycles rather than 24, where every day the people would go to sleep an hour later.  Along the line of the same question, weren&#39;t circadian rhythms found to just be tuned to a response of something daily that&#39;s consistent?  Well, what&#39;s more powerful and consistent than the effects of daylight/sunrise and darkness/sunset?  However, this can be artificially created through other sensory means.  Am I getting this wrong?<br><br>2) I didn&#39;t actually quite get the connection between blue light stimulating our wakefulness and how that&#39;s what causes us to sleep in long burst rather than 4 hours at a time.  The question here I guess is therefore implied.<br><br>3) Also, was it 4 hours sleep, 2 hours awake, and then 4 hours sleep again (then 14 hours awake of course), or something of this sort?<br><br>4) Aren&#39;t our natural sleep cycles around 1.5 hours at a time, so it would be closer to 4.5 hours and perhaps 3 the second time around?<br><br><br>Thanks!  A response would really be appreciated, especially if the answers to these are actually well understood at this point.
