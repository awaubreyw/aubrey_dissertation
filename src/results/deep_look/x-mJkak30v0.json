[{"comment_by": "Deep Look", "comment_text": "Hi Deep Peeps! We&#39;re getting a LOT of comments and questions about the researcher&#39;s bare hands during the dissection. Both Laura Ech\u00e1vez, a graduate student at Cal Poly Humboldt, and Chris Conroy, of UC Berkeley\u2019s Museum of Vertebrate Zoology, dissected pellets on camera for us. Neither of them wore gloves. We discussed at length with each one of them whether they wanted to wear gloves. Both of them said that gloves would reduce the dexterity they needed to do the dissections. And both agreed that pathogens pose a very low risk.
