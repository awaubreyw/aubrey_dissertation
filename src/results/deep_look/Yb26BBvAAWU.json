Go to your nearest dollar store and buy a bottle of hair conditioner and a fine tooth comb. Cover your dry head with enough hair conditioner to saturate your head. Then painstakingly comb out live lice and nits..washing them down the sink. If you are very persistent in combing lice and nits out of your hair..soaked with conditioner..the nasty little critters will be gone. Wash &amp; dry your hair and you are good to go.  And..another cheap and easy way to get rid of head lice is:  2. Again go to your nearest dollar store and buy a bottle of vegetable oil, a shower cap and a fine tooth comb. At night, before bed..saturate your head with the vegetable oil. Cover all of your hair with a plastic shower cap and you are ready for bed. Cover your pillow with a thick towel to catch any vegetable oil that might leak out..from under the shower cap. Now..go to sleep. When you awaken..the lice will be dead from suffocation (most of them at least). And again..you need to painstakingly comb out the lice and nits..washing them down the sink..as you go. If you are persistent with combing..you may not need another treatment..and again..the nasty little critters will be gone. Note: you may have to shampoo &amp; rinse your hair 3 or 4 times to get the vegetable oil out. When the oil is gone..dry your hair and you are once again..good to go. No need to buy expensive &amp; toxic chemicals to get rid of head lice. Sadly, these expensive products don&#39;t work most of the time anyway..because the lice have become resistant to them. So..go with the inexpensive, non-toxic products. If you do a good job of combing out the lice &amp; nits with your fine tooth comb..you will happily be..louse-free!!", "comment_date": "2019-08-27T17:25:22Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Swati Srivastava", "comment_text": "I am a kid btw but now I am so scared of my hair", "comment_date": "2019-08-27T14:27:50Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Nayeli Castel", "comment_text": "Ahhhhhhh my head itches now", "comment_date": "2019-08-27T10:18:17Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "EYELASH", "comment_text": "Its cute...\ud83d\ude36", "comment_date": "2019-08-26T15:22:46Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "qemon", "comment_text": "Oof why can&#39;t they live on their own heads ughh I need to shower :(", "comment_date": "2019-08-26T03:47:41Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Renzo Pabia", "comment_text": "Can I drown lice using a water bucket?", "comment_date": "2019-08-25T12:45:49Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Puppy with 10,000 subscribers", "comment_text": "Officially disgusted", "comment_date": "2019-08-25T09:31:34Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Irish Anne Ugat", "comment_text": "I can&#39;t believe other people go to salons to get their lice taken out I grew up with getting hit for moving my head even though my neck is killing me", "comment_date": "2019-08-25T08:26:07Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "ValMelon", "comment_text": "I got a lice ad before this", "comment_date": "2019-08-25T03:05:20Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "edma06", "comment_text": "I was watching a vid with a man that dosent taste anything and now I got recommended this", "comment_date": "2019-08-25T00:07:14Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Earnest Jan Traje", "comment_text": "Why am i looking at this?!?!?!", "comment_date": "2019-08-24T07:24:26Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Juan Rojas", "comment_text": "Flamethrower!!!", "comment_date": "2019-08-24T05:13:49Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "A", "comment_text": "My head is itchy because of stress", "comment_date": "2019-08-24T03:40:05Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "ladeva Karina", "comment_text": "Yiiiikkeeeeesss", "comment_date": "2019-08-24T00:15:08Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Gina\u267e", "comment_text": "Lice are disgusting <a href=\"http://suckers.no/\">suckers.no</a> pun intended\ud83d\ude33\ud83e\udd2e", "comment_date": "2019-08-23T20:44:21Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "l3m0n p\u00a1x\u00a1e", "comment_text": "<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yb26BBvAAWU&amp;t=1m41s\">1:41</a> \u201csay two kids.

This brought back some louse-related PTSD. When I was small, the only treatment for lice was pesticides, so my Mum Nixed my hair, picked the nits, and we thought we were done. NOPE. Caught them again from a schoolmate (blonde, and I was brunette) whose mum only used pesticide without picking nits. We got some SERIOUSLY chemical-resistant lice; double applications of Nix did NOTHING to kill them, and soon we were picking live lice out of each others&#39; hair and drowning them in a bowl of water. It was HORRIBLE.<br><br>Since then, I have learned more about them, and while I still get itchy and stressed thinking about them, they&#39;re actually pretty neat. One study I heard of suggested we actually pass head lice to each other because people with head lice, which don&#39;t spread disease, discourage body lice from moving in, which DO spread disease. This is why we like touching heads so much. And then there&#39;s the study I heard of that uses head lice and body lice evolution to figure out when humans started wearing clothes.
