Its an interesting question, what it means when we simultaneously drive animals to extinction in the wild yet in a sense provide a new niche which they thrive in. Theres stuff like urban foxes, coyotes and racoons, who now live a very different lifestyle from their wilder cousins. Lots of city birds as well, who now rely on those cities because their natural habitats are gone. And ofcourse theres domesticated animals like dogs, cats, sheep etc who we keep both for work and pleasure, who dont really have a wild habitat they are suited for anymore.<br><br>At least in this case, there is an alternative.
