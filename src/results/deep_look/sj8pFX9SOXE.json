All the while as they&#39;re discovering this, a secret ops force is trying to hunt them down to keep the secret hidden, because this is a Dan Brown book.", "comment_date": "2017-04-01T23:31:07Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Yang Fox", "comment_text": "wild roly poly appeared <del>GO POKEBALL!</del>", "comment_date": "2017-04-01T22:41:33Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Ghost Stalker", "comment_text": "i love This videos, but they&#39;re too short :c", "comment_date": "2017-04-01T22:26:10Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Adam Washington", "comment_text": "These are the only insects I&#39;ll touch with my bare hands.", "comment_date": "2017-04-01T21:42:47Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "draken865", "comment_text": "I thought this 23 years ago lol", "comment_date": "2017-04-01T21:39:20Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Birdy", "comment_text": "there called wood louse!", "comment_date": "2017-04-01T21:23:50Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "zenobia gonzales", "comment_text": "i remember getting them on a plastic shovel and collecting them :3", "comment_date": "2017-04-01T21:13:47Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "yourlilemogirl", "comment_text": "As a kid I used to keep one as a pet and named &quot;him&quot; Hermin.

Overlapping thoracic plates form a special pouch, called a marsupium, on the pillbug&#39;s underside. Upon hatching, the tiny juvenile pillbugs remain in the pouch for several days before leaving to explore the world on their own.<br><br>- <b>Pillbugs don&#39;t urinate.</b><br>Most animals must convert their wastes, which are high in ammonia, into urea before it can be excreted from the body. But pillbugs have an amazing ability to tolerate ammonia gas, which they can pass directly through their exoskeleton. So, there&#39;s no need for pillbugs to urinate.<br><br>- <b>A pillbug can drink with its anus.</b><br>Though pillbugs do drink the old-fashioned way \u2013 with their mouthparts \u2013 they can also take in water through their rear ends. Special tube-shaped structures called uropods can wick water up when needed.<br><br>- <b>Pillbugs eat their own poop.</b><br>Yes indeed, pillbugs munch on lots of feces, including their own. Each time a pillbug poops, it loses a little copper, an essential element it needs to live. In order to recycle this precious resource, the pillbug will consume its own poop, a practice known as coprophagy.<br><br>- <b>Sick pillbugs turn bright blue.</b><br>Like other animals, pillbugs can contract viral infections. If you find a pillbug that looks bright blue or purple, it&#39;s a sign of an iridovirus. Reflected light from the virus causes the cyan color.<br><br>- <b>A pillbug&#39;s blood is blue.</b><br>Many crustaceans, pillbugs included, have hemocyanin in their blood. Unlike hemoglobin, which contains iron, hemocyanin contains copper ions. When oxygenated, pillbug blood appears blue.<br><br>(Source: <a href=\"http://insects.about.com/od/isopods/a/10-facts-pillbugs.htm\">http://insects.about.com/od/isopods/a/10-facts-pillbugs.htm</a>)", "comment_date": "2017-01-18T00:13:53Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Foggy", "comment_text": "Hm, I always thought that rolly pollies looked like isopods", "comment_date": "2017-01-18T00:11:42Z", "likes_count": 123}, {"comment_by": "findtheearth", "comment_text": "What are the things called at <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sj8pFX9SOXE&amp;t=1m04s\">1:04</a>?", "comment_date": "2017-01-17T23:43:34Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Grif Guy", "comment_text": "Are these guys related to giant isopods?
