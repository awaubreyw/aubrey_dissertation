Another point is that while yes it is true that the extra CO2 can be used for plants and in theory will indeed aid their growth, the problem is that from an ecological standpoint this is still a disaster. A disaster because this will lead to a nutrient explosion creating a lot more life and once that CO2 runs out what will continue to feed the growth left behind by the extra CO2? Nothing, and so it will burn through that extra nutrient and die off in massive massive amounts.
