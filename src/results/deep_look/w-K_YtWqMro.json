I got stung twice in a 2 week period, once on my leg, and the second time on my finger.  I didn&#39;t got to the hospital, even though both scorps were bark scorps.  I got swelling and numbness in both stings, but the finger hurt terribly, and got 3 times its normal size.  I live in AZ--unfortunately, and it&#39;s been hellishly hot here, even in the northern part where I live.  I&#39;m OK now though.
