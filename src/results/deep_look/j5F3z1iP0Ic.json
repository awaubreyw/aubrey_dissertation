I have been to the grunion run a few times and I would recommend going if you ever get the chance. <br>I went to an aquarium a few months ago where they had a &quot;grunion hatching&quot; activity. You are given a jar with sand, water, and eggs, and you swirl it around until the eggs hatch. I always thought the sand had to break open the eggs... so I may have swirled those little grunions around a bit too much. They hatched just fine though! <br>Great video, by the way! :)", "comment_date": "2017-06-06T13:10:20Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "-Dash.", "comment_text": "Looks just like my ex", "comment_date": "2017-06-06T13:09:45Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Ellen Mae Bayalas", "comment_text": "I learned a lot from this video", "comment_date": "2017-06-06T13:09:12Z", "likes_count": 6}, {"comment_by": "Tyler May", "comment_text": "So freaking cool!", "comment_date": "2017-06-06T13:08:22Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Henry Drosen", "comment_text": "Wow.
