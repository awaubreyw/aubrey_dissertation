The municipal authorities guys often come and pour some film to cover stagnant lakes and ponds in the neighborhood in the summer months, and sometimes spray adulticides in our garden. This reminds me... it&#39;s April, which means that it&#39;s dengue season in India. My grand-mom sometimes kills mosquitoes using books, and so I often find splotches of dried blood and dead mosquitoes preserved between pages. I don&#39;t kill mosquitoes, because I don&#39;t kill any animals or insects.
