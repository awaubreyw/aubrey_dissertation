See the unseen at the very edge of our visible world. Explore big scientific mysteries by going incredibly small.\r<br>---\r<br>\r<br>With the holidays just around the corner, it\u2019s that time of year when you\u2019re ready to burn off Thanksgiving turkey and Christmas cookie calories by heading outdoors for a hike. Maybe you\u2019ve noticed what looks like spider webs woven in between weeds alongside the trail, or poking out from under rocks or draped across logs. \r<br>\r<br>But take a closer look \u2013 those webs might actually not be spider webs. A lot of them are silken habitats, known as &#39;galleries,&#39; created by insects called webspinners.\r<br>\r<br>---+ Read the entire article on KQED Science:\r<br>\r<br><a href=\"https://www.kqed.org/science/1949380/\">https://www.kqed.org/science/1949380/\r</a><br> \r<br>--- Where do webspinners live?\r<br>You find them living in a variety of habitats all over the world, from humid tropical rain forests to dry, hotter areas. \r<br>\r<br>--- Do only adults spin silk? \r<br>Actually, everybody spins silk, the males, females and the nymphs. It\u2019s completely unique for insects to have that ability. \r<br>\r<br>--- Who is briefly featured in the episode turning over the log?\r<br>While only her hands make a short cameo in the video, Janice Edgerly-Rooks, is a professor of biology at Santa Clara University.
