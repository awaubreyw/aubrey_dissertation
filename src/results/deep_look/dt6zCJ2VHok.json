The voice changes to a &quot;ooh that&#39;s a taboo topic&quot; voice and also you seem to often get less detailed than on other topics of animal behaviour. In this video it&#39;s notable around the <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dt6zCJ2VHok&amp;t=2m40s\">2:40</a> mark. I think acting like animal behaviour is anything like human behaviour (which you do if you describe sexuality in the animal kingdom as something somewhat taboo) is harmful for humans who apply it to their own sexuality, but most important it disguises how animal sexual behaviour actually functions, because you feel comfortable in your stereotypes. In saying &quot;ooh this is sex, you know, like in humans *wink wink*&quot; you automatically make your viewers see a similarity between the two that isn&#39;t necessarily there.
