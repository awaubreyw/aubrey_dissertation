I&#39;m just having a tough time determining how this instinct and capability would come into being from a random, accidental mutation of genes.

Let me ask you, if the tape we use is inferior to this chemical, yet the tape we use did not just &quot; evolve&quot;  it had a designer, does it not make sense that the far more complex chemical tape this insect uses must have had a designer too???  And a designer  who is even more superior in intellect and wisdom that the designer who created the tape we use?? This insect is following instinct which is a kind of biological program..similar to a program that tells a computer how to act...so if it takes an engineer to write a  computer program..then this insect must have had an engineer to write its program which we call instinct.. All this insect is doing is following its program (instinct) just like how your phone which is a computer follows its program. Now since this animal is following a program and your phone is following a program...can we say your phone just &quot;evolved&quot; ? NO we know the guys at apple designed it...so then how can we say that this insect which is a far more marvelous and complicated design than your phone, how can we say its program ( its instinct to build itself a home) just &quot;evolved&quot;   conclusion: your computer runs a program and this program was written and designed by an engineer, this insect runs a program called instinct which was also designed obviously by a superior engineer, OUR CREATOR and designer of the earth the universe and all that is in it and beyond.", "comment_date": "2019-08-17T15:21:50Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Nathaniel Arthur", "comment_text": "SLAP ON SOME FLEX TAPe", "comment_date": "2019-08-17T11:08:21Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "killer mind", "comment_text": "Uh pore bug he and she was fell that way ;-;", "comment_date": "2019-08-16T21:32:02Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Phillip Young", "comment_text": "How much does a house like thiers cost!", "comment_date": "2019-08-16T14:49:28Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Robin Bantigny", "comment_text": "I was so happy to find hundred of them in the rivers this summer in Dr\u00f4me, France.

Hi, Phil Swift here for Flex Tape\u00ae! The super strong, waterproof tape! That can instantly patch, bond, seal, and repair! Flex Tape is no ordinary tape. It&#39;s triple thick adhesive virtually welds itself to surfaces, instantly stopping the toughest leaks. Leaky pipes can cause MAJOR damage, but flex tape grips on tight and bonds instantly. PLUS, Flex Tape&#39;s powerful adhesive is so strong, it even works underwater! Now you can repair leaks in pools and spas without draining them. Flex Tape is perfect for marine, campers, and RVs. Flex Tape is super strong and once it&#39;s on, it holds on tight. And for emergency auto repair, Flex Tape keeps it&#39;s grip even in the toughest conditions. Big storms can cause big damage, but Flex Tape comes super wide so you can easily fix large holes. To show you the power of Flex Tape, I SAWED THIS BOAT IN HALF and repaired it with only Flex Tape. Not only does Flex Tape&#39;s powerful adhesive hold the boat together, but it creates a super strong, water-tight seal so the inside is completely dry. YEE DOGGIE! Just cut, peel, stick, and seal.

I love watching and learning about these little critters. I know my grandchildren would be fascinated too. I first became interested when for a summer project in 5th grade we all had to read a book and write a story on it. I was not very happy about that since I planned on spending a lot of time at Pulaski Park in Chicago swimming but I found a book about ants and every night I would read parts of it before bedtime. I wound up getting so involved in their lifestyle and read the book to my little brothers and sisters. As a grandmother I was layed off at the age of 60 and wound up helping my daughter with her newborn. As she grew older I took her all over the suburbs and pointed\u00a0out trees, leaves, ants, spiders and a train she us to love to watch pass by. She is not afraid of insects. She is 9 and a very smart little girl. I bought her the movie Charlottes Web and her mom bought her the book. Every spider she saw\u00a0 she called it Charlotte. She was much younger at the time. She had the neighbors smiling and asking her about the insects and squirrels and worms. I told her many stories so she passed them on\u00a0to our neighbors. They got such a kick out of hearing her tell them. Start them young and teach them the beautiful world around them. She will see this video.

The larva already has chitin in it&#39;s DNA code, so why not use that instead of evolving to produce super glue, notions for size and shape of blocks, needed for building a 3 dementional case around itself? Also how did this evolve? At 1st its saliva was just a little bit sticky and it could build less effective shelters with oddly sized rocks and logicly it was not effective, yet it kept trying for milions of years until natural selection tought it how to do it? Geting the anatomical tools and the skills to do it over  night is not an option, so it must have been a futile efford for a loooong time. Why did it keep pushing and HOW did it survive when it wasnt effective? I could never understand complex outcomes like this. I get how things get bigger, smaller or change shapes, but when a behaviour is either successful or not, how do you develop it and how does one bug commit for milions of years, doing something pointless, working towards a proffitable end result?", "comment_date": "2017-05-19T10:32:47Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Rebecca", "comment_text": "This silk would be good for skins on touring skis!", "comment_date": "2017-05-16T01:34:09Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Blackfish Ghggg", "comment_text": "Mr trump, this is all u need to build a wall", "comment_date": "2017-05-15T20:09:52Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "aknight47", "comment_text": "This is by far one of my favorite youtube channels out there.

Please do not compel us to accept a PC perspective, whether or not something proves or disproves evolution or not is really of no interest; I think most intelligent people can make that connection for themselves. (just think how you would feel if every science video demanded you swallow the Creationest perspective of every idea or discovery  mentioned in their subject matter). I think your clips should be not less than five minutes long, perhaps not exceeding ten minutes.
