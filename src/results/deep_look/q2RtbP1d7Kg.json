(Some harmless spiders are tolerated, but not welcomed.) The house centipede is rarely seen, is a voracious predator of other insects, and leaves no discernable nests, junk, or other droppings I have to encounter and clean. They do no damage, eat none of my food, and aren&#39;t pests. I see them once in a while, just a reminder that my insect-slaying task force is on duty. Because of them, I encounter far fewer bugs overall. Less roaches and other destructive bugs! They eat roaches, flies, silverfish, bed bugs, and most common house creepy-crawlies. When seen, they&#39;re usually out in the open only for a few moments. They flee from humans and are completely harmless. The scenario where one would bite a person is almost impossible with a person actively trying to be bitten, and even then the bite is minor. Other bugs I&#39;ll squish or catch and release outside my home. Centipedes I&#39;ll actually release in my home, like when they get stuck in the smooth porcelain bathtub I give them a path of toilet paper to climb out of back into the rest of the house. Spiders I find pretty icky. I&#39;ll usually tolerate them if I can confirm they&#39;re harmless. But they&#39;re not as good to have as centipedes.

The counter-tops have been\u00a0cleaned and the appliances are sparkling. Even the floor was waxed. \u00a0He\u2019s absolutely amazed.

It even watered the plants.<br><br>The man thinks to himself, \u201cThis is the most amazing thing I\u2019ve ever seen. This really is a pet that can do everything!\u201d Next he says to the centipede, \u201cRun down to the corner and get me a newspaper.\u201d The centipede walks out the door. \u00a0 10 minutes later\u2026no centipede. 20 minutes later\u2026 no centipede. \u00a030 minutes later\u2026 no centipede.
