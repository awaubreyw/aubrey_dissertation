In order to kill and preserve the insects, I would place them in a jar that had been filled with a toxic gas that killed them and dehydrated their corpses. In order to &quot;process&quot; more than one insect at a time, (I had to leave the bugs in overnight to ensure that they were fully dead and not just KO&#39;d) I would use those little plastic condiment cups you get at some restaurants, poke holes in the lids, and store the bugs in there as I gassed them. Turns out, some of these insects were bombardier beetles (likely the same species or genus a the ones shown since this happened not too far from Berkeley). <br>How do I know? For one, they had that same black and orange coloration pattern. For another, they sprayed like crazy when they died. I&#39;m not sure if it was only because of the chemicals they produced or if the toxic gas played a role but something crazy happened; the condiment containers started to melt. It was as if I had placed the cups in a microwave. They sagged under their own weight and the lid fused with the rim of the cup. I actually had to cut the cups open to get the insects out.<br><br>Hope someone finds this as interesting as I did.<br>PS: I do/did feel guilty going out of my way to kill all those bugs.

Theres plenty of similar examples in nature but few so clear as this beetle. <br><br> So the beetle needs to grow an organ that produces a chemical.  Then it needs another organ for a second chemical.  Then it needs a new enzyme to neutralize them.  Then it needs another enzyme to neutralize the neutralizer and a seperate organ to hold it. Its body needs to produce these all together and working in sync. <br><br>But were not done yet!<br><br>Lets assume all of these form in perfect harmony to provide a great defense and hundreds of its siblings shared the exact same mutation.  How does it work?  So now you need a new orafice.  Then you need to grow new muscles to spray it.  You need to grow new muscles to spray the deneutralizing enzyme.  <br><br>Not one of these offers a benefit without the whole system.  So in theory all these organs and chemicals produced would become vestigial or at the very least not have any selective reason to move forward in the species until the entire system is intact.  <br><br>Having a skin that can withstand fire doesnt suddenly mean you grow a complex fire spitting cannon.   Some animals may have evolved but this is not one of them.  So logic should follow that if there are some animals that could not have evolved then the theory cannot not be applied to all creatures.<br><br>Its very unscientific to be faced with clear evidence against a theory and hold to it with with religious zeal.
