It would be better to say that its &quot;structural interference&quot; created color. Color is just a phenomena of our minds create to represent different electromagnetic waves captured at various frequencies and intensities by cones and rods in our eyes transmitted to the brain over optical nerve for processing. At a certain level it all becomes structural. Generally the colored light generated off of the reflection of a pigmented object is due to the non uniform absorption of electromagnetic energy which causes the &quot;frequency pool&quot; of originating wave to be changed from it&#39;s previous state. Regular light absorption is structural, light reflected or absorbed based on the dimensions and arrangement of atomic structures. This is why color is useful to us, because by using the color shift  caused by structures,  we can infer what something is made of (Absorption spectrography &amp; spectrographs). The blue butterfly parts have their own reflective and refractive properties but they don&#39;t match the underlying atomic structure of the petals because of the prisms created that cause most of the non blue visible light to be cancelled out, this is why when sufficiently damaging or &quot;wetting&quot; the petals, the color changes because it cancels out the prism effect of the &quot;Christmas tree&quot; structures in the wing petals. Crushing &quot;pigments&quot; doesn&#39;t cause the color of the pigment to change because the atomic structure of a pigment is uniform and does not rely on super structures to create modifying prisms, so at any break point we can expect the same absorption behavior", "comment_date": "2019-12-08T23:21:59Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Aramaria Flo", "comment_text": "The blue wings butterfly looks like Mothra spreading her wings behind the waterfalls and her wings became blue", "comment_date": "2019-11-09T17:45:37Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Ric Ky", "comment_text": "A Butterfly, but with a ball gown.
