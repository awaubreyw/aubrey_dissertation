If they only live two weeks though, then they wouldn&#39;t live long enough to come back here to NY after winter. So, does that mean that there are multiple generations of butterflies here in NY then multiple generations of butterfly down in Mexico too?

That sometimes means the caterpillar has OE, a protozoan parasite. Most pupae with OE emerge crippled, often deformed wings. Those that don\u2019t spread the disease, where the spore falls from their abdomens like glitter onto eggs/milkweed leaves.<br>In California, where this was filmed, the resident milkweed is the nonnative tropical milkweed (A. curassavica). It\u2019s a garden-favorite for its scarlet to golden flowers that attract all pollinators. But because many regions of CA don\u2019t have frigid weather to \u201ckill off\u201d tropical milkweed, unlike northern states, OE spores can build up on the plant. And since tropical milkweed can grow year round, more monarchs stay in SoCal instead of migrating. This in turn spreads more OE spores, leading to a ~30% OE rate in SoCal monarchs.<br>So um, what are the options?<br>1. Cut down tropical milkweed every fall, so new growth is ready in the spring.<br>2. Grow native milkweed.<br><br>The monarch population is on the decline.
