They are released in short spurts every 7 minutes, from a few locations. The &quot;pheramone sinker&quot; we call it, it&#39;s mobile just toss in the thin hose with sinker at the end, and turn on the pump thats on a timer with a car battery protected, pumping out no differently than a Drip Feed system. Literally the same thing. We do not mix both of the pheramones, each is on its own bucket with own pump and all that. We leave it for a few weeks at a time, and put it in areas we arent trying to seed quite yet, to take care of any  weeds , or if weeds pop up in a seeded area that hasn&#39;t matured we&#39;ll do it there. Other farmers in the area tried killing theirs and paid the price, literally, higher costs in time and ferts for things they didn&#39;t need before, they&#39;ve become the tadpole shrimps replacement and dont much like it....then end up having to repopulate them in the end if they get smart.<br><br>The pheramones can be obtained by having an indoor shrimp farm under very controlled conditions, so that you can stimulate the pheramones you want. and for the cranberry and rice, we have a loop of tents in different phases of growth so we can have a constantly fresh batch as with the live shrimp. but unlike the shrimp, we have to kill the plants grown in the tents for this purpose, we&#39;ll take the tender shoots and roots and blend them up, filter and refridgerate. We add the proper ratio to the dwc buckets of water for drip feeding into the field.<br><br>if wind is low, we&#39;ll pop a sump in and recirculate the water from the field to push the fluids out farther , those will run for 2 minutes after each release that happens every 7 minutes.<br><br>This sounds like a lot of work, and i might have to put it up on youtube so you can trust me, but it&#39;s worth it believe me, and not hard at all after setting up the first one.", "comment_date": "2021-10-18T05:20:09Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "AmazeAngeloGames", "comment_text": "wow this is so cool and Yes they are pest for farmers", "comment_date": "2021-10-18T04:34:49Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Isabelly Button", "comment_text": "I just found this channel and I find it to be so fascinating.
