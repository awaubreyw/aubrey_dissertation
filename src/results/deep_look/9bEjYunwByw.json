[{"comment_by": "Deep Look", "comment_text": "We&#39;ve received several questions about how turret spiders mate if they don&#39;t stray from their own individual burrow. When male turret spiders are mature enough, they venture out looking for females. They usually wait until the fall after the rains have started which keeps the spiders from drying out when they are above ground. A male turret spider will (very carefully) enter a receptive female&#39;s burrow and they mate. The males don&#39;t return to their burrows and the females aren&#39;t looking for a roommate, so it&#39;s pretty much the end of the line for the males. The females live much longer and may have multiple clutches of eggs throughout their lives. They lay their eggs in their burrow and when they hatch, the spiderlings venture out and start excavating their own burrows nearby. That&#39;s why it&#39;s common to find a few small turrets surrounding a larger turret that belongs to their mom. It&#39;s very rare to see these activities and we weren&#39;t able to film them for this short episode.

They belong to a group of arthropods called arachnids. Ticks, scorpions and mites are arachnids, too. A spider&#39;s body is divided into two sections. Here we have the cephalothorax, that&#39;s made up of the head and thorax. Four pairs of legs are attached to the cephalothorax. That&#39;s eight legs in all. Most spiders also have eight eyes, although some have fewer. This part is called the abdomen. You&#39;ll find many of their organs here, along with specialized glands that produce silk. The silk is a liquid in their body, but it goes solid when it comes into contact with the air. It becomes an elastic incredibly strong line of silk that spiders use for all sorts of things. Spiders can hang from long drag lines. They protect their eggs with it. Digging spiders lye in their tunnels with silk. And baby spiders use long strands of it to float on air crafts. We call this ballooning, by the way. But my favorite thing they do with it is spin webs. Not all spiders make webs, but the ones that do string them where they live to catch passing insects. If a bug gets caught in the web, the spider quickly crawls over and ties up the bug with more webbing. It bites the bug, injecting a venom that paralyzes it. Oh, by the way, not many spiders are poisonous to humans. But if there are some in your area, then you should learn what they look like so you know how to avoid them. So, when a spider is ready to eat it&#39;s prey, it injects an enzyne that turns the bug into a liquid, then it sucks this liquid, consuming the bug. So those are spiders. All in all a pretty neat animal.", "comment_date": "2019-11-13T05:08:39Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "The Southern Vikingr", "comment_text": "<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bEjYunwByw&amp;t=2m30s\">2:30</a><br>Talk about Mr. Oblivious.", "comment_date": "2019-11-12T09:42:22Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "SCP", "comment_text": "If reincarnation is real, I want to become one of these spiders.
