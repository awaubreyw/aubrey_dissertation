So, if you use Fahrenheit, the otter is twice as hot as the water; if you use Celcius, it&#39;s four times as hot and if you use kelvin, it&#39;s only 105 hotter. It only makes sense to say &quot;twice as X&quot; if all the units agree on where zero is. So, for example, it&#39;s OK to say that a 2lb bad of sugar weighs twice as much as a 1lb bag, since that&#39;s the same as saying that a 0.9kg bag weighs twice as much as a 0.45kg bag. Likewise, saying that a 3ft child is half the height of a 6ft man is the same as saying that a 0.9m child is half the height of a 1.8m man.", "comment_date": "2021-08-28T16:51:25Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "I R I S H", "comment_text": "Joey brought me here \ud83e\udda6\ud83d\udc95", "comment_date": "2021-08-10T08:55:10Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "MushroomNg", "comment_text": "Wow", "comment_date": "2021-07-22T02:46:56Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "C", "comment_text": "So that&#39;s why they do the rub rub", "comment_date": "2021-04-22T12:43:52Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "wolfpacrule", "comment_text": "\ud83e\udd29\ud83e\udd29\ud83e\udd29 baby otter", "comment_date": "2021-04-22T05:21:25Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Rainer Stratosphere", "comment_text": "Miyu", "comment_date": "2021-03-14T02:51:56Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Christina Watkins", "comment_text": "I dont like how this video speaks about evolution like it is proven fact, it is still just theory.", "comment_date": "2021-03-11T08:44:49Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "\u042d\u043c\u043c\u0430 \u041a\u043e\u0437\u043b\u043e\u0432\u0430", "comment_text": "\u041c\u043e\u0440\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0435 \u0435\u0436\u0438,\u043c\u0438\u0434\u0438\u0438 \u043b\u044e\u0431\u0438\u043c\u044b\u0439 \u043a\u0430\u043c\u0443\u0448\u0435\u043a \u0442\u0430\u0441\u043a\u0430\u044e\u0442 \u043f\u043e\u0434\u043c\u044b\u0448\u043a\u043e\u0439.\u0442\u0430\u043a\u0438\u0435 \u0441\u043c\u0435\u0448\u043d\u044b\u0435.", "comment_date": "2021-02-28T06:29:52Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "\u042d\u043c\u043c\u0430 \u041a\u043e\u0437\u043b\u043e\u0432\u0430", "comment_text": "\u041e\u043a\u043e\u043b\u043e \u0440\u0443\u0441\u0441\u043a\u043e\u0433\u043e \u043e\u0441\u0442\u0440\u043e\u0432\u0430 \u0442\u043e\u0436\u0435  \u043a\u0430\u043b\u0430\u043d\u044b \u0435\u0441\u0442\u044c \u0432 \u0440\u043e\u0441\u0441\u0438\u0438.\u0432\u043b\u0430\u0434\u0438\u0432\u043e\u0441\u0442\u043e\u043a.", "comment_date": "2021-02-28T06:28:19Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Anoushka Armstrong", "comment_text": "not evolution, that&#39;s for sure !! caring Wisdom it is !!!!

Just because a trait is different in two species doesn&#39;t mean it&#39;s an adaptation. Turns out all mustelids (weasel family, includes the otters) have that same sharp petaled pattern, even the terrestrial ones like weasels, martens, sables, wolverines, etc. Coyotes look different because, well, coyotes are in the dog family; they&#39;re not closely related. If the scales were an adaptation for aquatic living, they should have different morphology in terrestrial and aquatic mustelids, which we don&#39;t really see.\u00a0<br>That being said, I do appreciate the clip.
