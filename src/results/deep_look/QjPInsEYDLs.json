These herbivores blend in seamlessly with their surroundings because  they look exactly like their favorite food: fruit leaves. \r<br>\r<br>But you can definitely see these fascinating creatures at the California Academy of Sciences, located in the heart of San Francisco&#39;s Golden Gate Park, through the spring of 2022. \r<br>An ongoing interactive exhibit, \u2018Color of Life,\u2019 explores the role of color in the natural world. It&#39;s filled with a variety of critters, including Gouldian finches, green tree pythons, Riggenbach&#39;s reed frogs, and of course, giant leaf insects.\r<br>\r<br>---+ Read the entire article on KQED Science:\r<br>\r<br><a href=\"https://www.kqed.org/science/1947830/...\">https://www.kqed.org/science/1947830/...\r</a><br>\r<br>--- What do giant leaf insects eat?\r<br>They\u2019re herbivores, so they stick to eating leaves from their habitats, like guava and mango.\r<br>\r<br>--- What\u2019s one main difference between male and female giant leaf insects? \r<br>Males can actually fly as they have wings, which they use for mating.\r<br>\r<br>--- But did you know that females don\u2019t need males for mating?\r<br>\r<br>They are facultatively parthenogenetic, which means they sometimes mate or sometimes reproduce asexually. If they mate with a male, they produce both males and females, but if the eggs remain unfertilized \u2013 only females are produced.\r<br>\r<br>---+ For more information:\r<br>Visit California Academy of Sciences\r<br><a href=\"https://calacademy.org/\">https://calacademy.org/\r</a><br>\r<br>---+ More Great Deep Look episodes:\r<br>\r<br>It\u2019s a Bug\u2019s Life: <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list...\">https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list...\r</a><br>\r<br>---+ Shoutout!\r<br>\r<br>\ud83c\udfc6Congratulations \ud83c\udfc6to the following fans on our YouTube community tab for correctly identifying the type of reproduction female leaf insects can use in the absence of a suitable male - parthenogenesis. \r<br>\r<br>Sylly\r<br>Jim Spencer\r<br>Rikki Anne\r<br>Cara Rose\r<br>GOT7 HOT7 THOT7 VISUAL7\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>---+ Thank you to our Top Patreon Supporters ($10+ per month)!\r<br>\r<br>Trae Wright\r<br>Justin Bull\r<br>Bill Cass\r<br>Alice Kwok\r<br>Sarah Khalida Mohamad\r<br>Stefficael Uebelhart\r<br>Daniel Weinstein\r<br>Chris B Emrick\r<br>Seghan Seer\r<br>Karen Reynolds\r<br>Tea Torvinen\r<br>David Deshpande\r<br>Daisuke Goto\r<br>Amber Miller\r<br>Companion Cube\r<br>WhatzGames\r<br>Richard Shalumov\r<br>Elizabeth Ann Ditz\r<br>Robert Amling\r<br>Gerardo Alfaro\r<br>Mary Truland\r<br>Shirley Washburn\r<br>Robert Warner\r<br>johanna reis\r<br>Supernovabetty\r<br>Kendall Rasmussen\r<br>Sayantan Dasgupta\r<br>Cindy McGill\r<br>Leonhardt Wille\r<br>Joshua Murallon Robertson\r<br>Pamela Parker\r<br>Roberta K Wright\r<br>Shelley Pearson Cranshaw\r<br>KW\r<br>Silvan Wendland\r<br>Two Box Fish\r<br>Johnnyonnyful\r<br>Aurora\r<br>George Koutros\r<br>monoirre\r<br>Dean Skoglund\r<br>Sonia Tanlimco\r<br>Guillaume Morin\r<br>Ivan Alexander\r<br>Laurel Przybylski\r<br>Allen\r<br>Jane Orbuch\r<br>Rick Wong\r<br>Levi Cai\r<br>Titania Juang\r<br>Nathan Wright\r<br>Syniurge\r<br>Carl\r<br>Kallie Moore\r<br>Michael Mieczkowski\r<br>Kyle Fisher\r<br>Geidi Rodriguez\r<br>JanetFromAnotherPlanet\r<br>SueEllen McCann\r<br>Daisy Trevino \r<br>Jeanne Sommer\r<br>Louis O&#39;Neill\r<br>riceeater\r<br>Katherine Schick\r<br>Aurora Mitchell\r<br>Cory\r<br>Nousernamepls\r<br>Chris Murphy\r<br>PM Daeley\r<br>Joao Ascensao\r<br>Nicolette Ray\r<br>TierZoo\r<br>\r<br>---+ Follow KQED Science and Deep Look:\r<br>\r<br>Patreon: <a href=\"https://www.patreon.com/deeplook\">https://www.patreon.com/deeplook\r</a><br>Instagram: <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/kqedscience/\">https://www.instagram.com/kqedscience/\r</a><br>Twitter: <a href=\"https://www.twitter.com/kqedscience\">https://www.twitter.com/kqedscience\r</a><br>KQED Science on <a href=\"http://kqed.org/\">kqed.org</a>: <a href=\"http://www.kqed.org/science\">http://www.kqed.org/science\r</a><br>Facebook Watch: <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/DeepLookPBS/\">https://www.facebook.com/DeepLookPBS/\r</a><br>\r<br>---+ About KQED\r<br>\r<br>KQED, an NPR and PBS affiliate in San Francisco, CA, serves Northern California and beyond with a public-supported alternative to commercial TV, Radio and web media.\r<br>\r<br>Funding for Deep Look is provided in part by PBS Digital Studios.

The ants move them into their nest thinking they are seeds, but once in there the eggs lose their attractive odor and the ants ignore them. About 12 months later the stick insects emerge from their eggs in the heart of the ant nest, but produce a scent that mimmicks a scent that the ants themselves produce and the hatchlings are left alone. Not only this, the stick insects behave and move just like the ants do and so this ensures they are not intetferred with. The hatchlings leave the ant nest and head for a tree and start climbing like an ant but soon they change their behavior and movements to resemble a tiny stck or leaf.
