[{"comment_by": "Gabriela Quiros", "comment_text": "Hello Deep Look fans. Thank you very much for watching! I produced this episode of Deep Look and wrote an article to accompany the video. I know many of you are curious about how to best remove a tick. Kerry Padgett, supervising biologist and tick expert at the California Department of Public Health, recommends grabbing the tick close to the skin using a pair of fine tweezers and simply pulling straight up.<br><br>Padgett warned against using other strategies.<br><br>\u201cDon\u2019t use Vaseline or try to burn the tick or use a cotton swab soaked in soft soap or any of these other techniques that might take a little longer or might not work at all,\u201d she said. \u201cYou really want to remove the tick as soon as possible.\u201d<br><br>Time is of the essence. If an infected tick bites humans, it actually takes at least 24 hours before Lyme bacteria start swimming out in the saliva the tick drips into its host.<br><br>So don\u2019t worry if the tick\u2019s mouth parts \u2014 the ones covered in those tenacious hooks \u2014 stay behind when you pull.<br><br>\u201cThe mouth parts are not going to transmit disease to people,\u201d said Padgett.<br><br>Once the tick\u2019s body is no longer attached, it can\u2019t transmit bacteria. And if the mouth stays behind in your skin, it will eventually work its way out, sort of like a splinter does, she said.<br><br>You can read my complete article here: <a href=\"https://www.kqed.org/science/1920972/how-ticks-dig-in-with-a-mouth-full-of-hooks\">https://www.kqed.org/science/1920972/how-ticks-dig-in-with-a-mouth-full-of-hooks</a><br><br>Thank you for watching!  --Gabriela", "comment_date": "2018-03-23T03:23:17Z", "likes_count": 3326}, {"comment_by": "TCircuitry", "comment_text": "Fun fact: mosquitoes are the most common prey for amphibians.", "comment_date": "2022-08-25T21:58:42Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "dan rodrigues", "comment_text": "WHY DO THEY HAVE LYME DISEASE CENTERS OF STUDY IN THE MIDDLE OF CITIES AND COLLEGE CAMPUSES....

I am questing a further video on this subject, and I am unanimous on that (get the reference, extra points).  Like the Ramans, ticks seem to do everything in threes.  You can thank me, if you wish, for providing THAT reference free of charge.<br><br>Kidding aside, the burn method (you blow out the match and immediately apply) was the standard method generally spread around by word of mouth, when I was young.  I used it a couple of times and it worked fine (that sentence was not sarcasm or silliness, the sentences following are gospel as well).  <br><br>The scuttlebutt then was that if the head was left behind it would burrow down into your body, which at 65 sounds marginally ridiculous, but it was a different time. Though we were also told a cockroach could live for a relatively long period of time without its head, which IS true, so there&#39;s that.  Enough said, of that I am quite sure.  I will add more.  Anyone about my same age will be fully aware of these  &#39;facts&#39;, most of them.  Yes, I am in a weird mood right now.  Enjoy or excuse, take your pick (another fine reference, the original was &quot;Our motto here at camp, clean mind, clean body, take your pick&quot;.<br><br>My niece got Lyme disease, there is NOTHING funny about that.  The 40% carrying that disease in some areas mentioned here was actually a little bit frightening.
