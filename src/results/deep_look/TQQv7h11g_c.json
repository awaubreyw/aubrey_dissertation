[{"comment_by": "graphite", "comment_text": "Here in Australia we have the Richmond birdwing butterfly, and it&#39;s caterpillars feed on the birdwing pipe vine. This plant has become rather uncommon.<br>Unfortunately there is another pipe vine, an invasive species called the calico Dutchman&#39;s pipe vine. It&#39;s very common .<br>The butterflies will lay their eggs on this feral species, they can&#39;t seem to tell the difference between this and the native species.<br>It has a 100% mortality on all the birdwing caterpillars that hatch and feed on it.<br> Because of this, habitat loss and drought, the Richmond birdwing butterfly is now a threatened species.<br> Luckily schools and environmentally responsible families are planting the native pipevine species and removing the invasive one. Hopefully this will boost the numbers of the Richmond birdwing butterfly so that it is no longer threatened with extinction.", "comment_date": "2021-05-18T13:49:19Z", "likes_count": 916}, {"comment_by": "Olaf Elsberry", "comment_text": "Yay plant fornication.", "comment_date": "2022-08-27T22:10:12Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Greninjastorm", "comment_text": "Wurmple", "comment_date": "2022-08-21T18:44:34Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "YourAvrgeGaymer", "comment_text": "I love lauras voice", "comment_date": "2022-07-25T13:26:47Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "stan clark", "comment_text": "Awwww so cute and pretty blue!", "comment_date": "2022-07-21T05:02:00Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Thorne Chant", "comment_text": "From now on I&#39;ll always pronounce fungi as fun-jai.", "comment_date": "2022-07-14T12:49:49Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "mushroom", "comment_text": "Emo caterpillar", "comment_date": "2022-07-13T10:20:27Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Cobabes", "comment_text": "I like how she said \u201cdisoriented gnat\u201d at the end of the vid lol \ud83d\ude02", "comment_date": "2022-06-26T02:10:26Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Kizmo-ix", "comment_text": "Plant WHAAAT....
