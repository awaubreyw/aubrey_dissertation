Couple of things that I would fix...Riffle beetles definitely live in the water in their larva stage because I find them all the time. I guess I&#39;m not exactly sure where they pupate, but to say they spend their early life on land is inaccurate. They do create that bubble when they first become adults.<br><br>Also, the plastron serves as a oxygen exchange surface, allowing oxygen to diffuse from the water into the bubble because the concentration of oxygen is higher in the water than the plastron. Therefore it serves a different purpose than the bubble on the tips of the predaceous diving beetle.
