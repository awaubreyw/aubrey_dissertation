[{"comment_by": "Gabriela Quiros", "comment_text": "Hi Deep Look fans! I produced this episode. Here are the answers to a few questions you have asked. Nelson Hall, a doctoral student at Stanford University who studies planarians provided me with the answers below. Thanks for watching! -Gabriela<br> <br>1- What would happen if a planarian were cut lengthwise, rather than from side to side, as we show in the video?<br>It would take a little longer to regenerate, but it would regenerate all the same.<br><br>2- How do planarians reproduce?<br>Some reproduce sexually, by mating and laying eggs. Others reproduce asexually, by breaking off a piece of their body from which a new planarian grows. <br><br>3- How do planarians die? <br>Hall says they can die from infection or starvation. \u201cIf you really want to kill a worm,\u201d he says, \u201cyou can dehydrate it, keep it over 30 degrees Celsius, freeze it, or use toxic chemicals. I\u2019m sure you could get creative with how to kill planarians, but cutting (within reason) and aging will not do it.\u201d<br><br>4- If you put a planarian in a blender, would each bit regenerate?<br>\u201cUnfortunately, probably not,\u201d Hall says. \u201cA planarian in a blender will just produce very dead worm mush.\u201d<br><br>5- What is the smallest amount of planarian that can regenerate?<br>\u201cIf the wound can close and if the remaining fragment has at least one stem cell,\u201d says Hall, then it can grow a whole new planarian. \u00a0<br><br>6- Are planarians immortal? <br>If none of the situations described above were to happen, then yes, a planarian could be immortal. For asexual planarians \u2013 the ones that reproduce by breaking off a piece of their bodies and growing a new planarian \u2013 there\u2019s no evidence that they age, Hall says. For planarians that reproduce sexually, there may be a slight decline in fertility with age.", "comment_date": "2018-10-25T16:50:09Z", "likes_count": 4672}, {"comment_by": "R(ias", "comment_text": "I am from India \ud83c\uddee\ud83c\uddf3  , it&#39;s useful  for my study", "comment_date": "2022-08-24T00:02:10Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "cahya chan ml", "comment_text": "Kids don&#39;t cut yourself in half after this", "comment_date": "2022-08-21T10:21:18Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "LOBBY PLAYS!", "comment_text": "<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m12xsf5g3Bo&amp;t=1m03s\">1:03</a> bro this one looks so cute", "comment_date": "2022-08-20T20:47:30Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "LOBBY PLAYS!", "comment_text": "imagine cutting a planarian and then saving one just jeep on and decide to go further.", "comment_date": "2022-08-20T20:46:28Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Vortex YT\u30b7\ufe0e", "comment_text": "just drink a bunch of demon blood then u can regenerate instantly", "comment_date": "2022-08-15T15:18:57Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Voxel the Glitch and Retro Mech", "comment_text": "I thought all flatworms lived in the sea, until I discovered hammerhead flatworms, that live on land.", "comment_date": "2022-08-01T14:11:20Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "brandon rembe", "comment_text": "Well we can regrow our liver if we have at least 30% of it left.", "comment_date": "2022-08-01T12:32:14Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "\u30cf\u30ed\u30fcit's \u30df", "comment_text": "I , me ,myself and what?", "comment_date": "2022-08-01T03:13:03Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Kaotsi", "comment_text": "Extreme weight loss, Planarian style", "comment_date": "2022-07-29T22:00:34Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Shadowslayerz", "comment_text": "Scientist:flatworms are going EXTINCT!<br>Jerry:GET DA KNIFE", "comment_date": "2022-07-28T03:42:38Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "BriMazzu", "comment_text": "Zombies with this ability would be terrifying.", "comment_date": "2022-07-27T00:35:42Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Amna Qureshi", "comment_text": "Bruh I\u2019m having an existential crisis right now! lol.

Though not quite as efficient or miraculous as the planarian, it far outstrips lizards, newts, and cockroaches in terms of lost limb recovery. Snip off its arm at the shoulder, and that sucker will be back in a month or two as if nothing happened. Same size, same strength. Sure, the arm won&#39;t grow a new Axolotl, but for a vertebrate, that&#39;s quite impressive. So why can&#39;t we do that? The reason, it seems, comes down to bleeding. As mammals, we run the risk of bleeding out much more quickly than a planarian or an amphibian like the Axolotl. So our bodies rush to stop that blood loss through the use of clots in the short term, and scars in the long term. Scars are made of fibrous connective tissue, closer to a cell matrix than actual cells. And nothing can grow ON a scar. If you could inhibit the scarring process for long enough, it&#39;s very possible the body could rebuild at least part of the lost limb. But our body will optimally prioritize life over function, and losing a finger or an arm forever is a small price to pay if the heart keeps beating and the brain running.", "comment_date": "2019-02-17T14:32:01Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "infinitepk", "comment_text": "Is it just me or...oh my god...it looks like a mushroom when its cut off", "comment_date": "2019-02-17T13:06:16Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Bernard Parong", "comment_text": "can we add blastema to our body to become those things?", "comment_date": "2019-02-17T12:18:47Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Cotton Candy Skies", "comment_text": "These are cute but they make me shiver and think one of them is right beside me. .-.", "comment_date": "2019-02-17T10:22:22Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "This is A cat", "comment_text": "What happens if you smash it?", "comment_date": "2019-02-17T09:38:11Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Kimmi Elizabeth", "comment_text": "They&#39;re nasty when they are wriggling around on the stone but under the microscope, they&#39;re cute little dotes", "comment_date": "2019-02-17T09:24:30Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "konodiodaddy", "comment_text": "I kinda think those things are really cute.", "comment_date": "2019-02-17T06:51:32Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Muzan&Friends", "comment_text": "This video should have been called.
