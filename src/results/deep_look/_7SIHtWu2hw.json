So they are very good plants to have from a long term perspective. Once ground nutrients and PH is normalised other plants easily out-compete them. <br>A mowed lawn is akin to a grazed meadow. However of course dandelions are the first thing to be grazed. So basically with a lawn your best bet is to mow regularly enough so that flowers and seeds can never form. However it is worth noting that dandelions are very good for your lawn too if you can live with them. They will only take over if your soil is really poor.<br>In most cases you can sample your soil to determine deficiencies that you can nudge into a better range through fertilisers. Your other plants then have a chance to out-compete them.<br>But dandelions are good for soil. No mess. No fertiliser runoff. No fuss.
