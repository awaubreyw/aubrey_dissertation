[{"comment_by": "Nothing\\", "comment_text": "I don&#39;t get how a warning mechanism like a rattle is supposed to work though. If I was an animal and I&#39;d never heard that sound before, and a snake started rattling at me, I&#39;d have no idea what it meant. And if I HAD been bitten before and known the sound of a rattle is a really bad thing, it seems like as an animal, I probably wouldn&#39;t survive to remember that fact. Maybe it&#39;s the same mechanism that makes some people just inherently scared of snakes or spiders for no good reason. Just an evolutionary memory of some sort?
