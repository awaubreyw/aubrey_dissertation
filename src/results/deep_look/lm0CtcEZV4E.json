One question- how did the falcon evolve its tubercles? Were they suffocating during high speed dives, and so got together and had a meeting and thought &quot; how can we fix this&quot;?. Can you not see that your evolution examples are a lie. Tubercles are pure design, just like the entire bird- with all of its integrated systems. Also, if you guys think 3 random chemicals in a puddle had romance and created life / non living chemicals evolved, and then peregrin falcons did too, then you are just adding to a false narrative. There is more than enough evidence to show immaculate design. Hope you take a good deep look at yourselves.
