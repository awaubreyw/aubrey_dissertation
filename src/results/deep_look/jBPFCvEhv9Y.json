The rest of the story got messed up cause then another spider moved to a nest next to it I think wanting to steal its food but then I realized there was a spider crawling its way into the new bigger spider that was watching the smaller spider eat the fly I gave it. Well after seeing that and realizing finally it was a killer spider killing spiders I took it out luckily the spider did not see it coming cause it was to busy burrowing its way inside the other spider.. So I got to watch my new baby spider eat peacefully then my dad let a bug bomb off under the porch right next to smoking spot then I realized the baby spider did finish the fly but after the posion it was doing a death curl when spiders are about to die they curl there feet to there chest so I took him away from the nest to the grass he went back for the posionios area I had no choice but to end its misourey. MAde me really wish spiders were a bit smarter. By the way it was OBV it got poisoned cause as it crawled back to its nest it zig zagged and really slowly :/ RIP wacky 8 leggy I gave him that name cause of the term &quot;wacky tabacky&quot;", "comment_date": "2021-07-23T03:37:29Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Hanzoftexas", "comment_text": "Someone build a fly suit so we can fly or for our cars.", "comment_date": "2021-07-23T03:35:31Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "BlueFeral", "comment_text": "Propaganda, they actually teleported back in time to know how to dodge my swatter", "comment_date": "2021-07-23T03:28:44Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Raindoset \u2584\ufe3b\u0337\u033f\u253b\u033f\u2550\u2501\u4e00", "comment_text": "Frog: you underestimate me", "comment_date": "2021-07-23T03:18:24Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "ZapDoggo", "comment_text": "A flys worst enemy are blinds", "comment_date": "2021-07-23T02:49:52Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Misho Galic", "comment_text": "Ain\u2019t nothing dodging my swatter I promise you that.

If I am forced to choose between a ruler tool and a plastic fly swatter, I prefer the ruler no matter what because I am still able to kill it with that thing.

The hint reason why I go with the white paper towel sheet is that they are seeing 1 color, white and it reflects on bright things as represent of blindingness which fools the fly all the time, even you got color brown, it won&#39;t move because all they see is 1 color which they are trying think for &quot;what is this object in front of me&quot; that what they are thinking.", "comment_date": "2021-07-21T00:24:48Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "SlimAndCanSeeMyFeetShady", "comment_text": "I spray flies in my kitchen with dawn power wash dish spray.

So that&#39;s where I came up with my striking distance. As for angle of attack, I noticed the majority of flies were taking off at about a 45\u00b0 angle and flying in whatever general direction they were facing. So, I took count with how late I was with swatting the fly. Changed my striking distance. Changed my target zone to roughly one inch infront of the fly. Now I&#39;m swatting them with 80% accuracy!

If you attack straight from any side and aim ahead of that direction, they usuallt fly opposite the direction you attack from, but often fly at a random angle. This makes this method more predictable but still not good enough. If you attack from any side AND at a specific angle, they still fly the opposite direction of the attack, but they almost always follow the same angle you attack from. Therefore if you attack from the left at an upward diagonal angle, they very often fly to the right at an upward diagonal angle. In this situation, you would aim your attack ahead of them to the right at an upward diagonal angle where you predict they will fly. This way, even though they dodge almost as soon as you move, you&#39;ll catch them in their flight path.

They see the motion and try to fly away but they can&#39;t really take that time to determine the optimum path to avoid the motion. (like not reacting to it or flying in a more horizontal direction). They instinctively fly up and away in nearly all cases. You just have to take advantage of that and get in low enough that you catch them in that initial &quot;up&quot; portion of their flight path where there is typically little variation in the direction they go in.

This starts to incapacitate them and when they&#39;re momentarily down, you can soak them. Once soaked they can be disposed of with tissue.

This way you maximise the chance of hitting once it starts flying away.<br>-Approach the fly slowly. I didn&#39;t know flies had trouble seeing static objects I kinda just found out moving slowly allows you to get closer without it flying away. Exercise lots of patience.<br>-Get as close as possible to maximise your chance of getting the fly but beware the risk of the insect flying away before you have the chance to swat it. You need some experience with this tip.<br>-Get behind the fly. I don&#39;t know why but I can generally get closer to a fly when I&#39;m behind it. I thought those things had all-round vision but perhaps their rear view is not as good. You may need to rely on luck for this tip as well as for the first tip. <br>-Use bait. I usually sprinkle some crumbs of any left-overs onto the floor and wait for flies to let their guards down. Sometimes the squashed carcasses of previous victims make good bait too. <br><br>Using most of these tips I&#39;ve even been able to squash flies under my shoe by lifting it slightly over bait. It&#39;s become somewhat of a past-time for me on some occasions. Maybe I&#39;ve spent too much time killing flies.<br><br>Edit: FYI most of the time I don&#39;t use a fly swatter but a slipper", "comment_date": "2020-11-27T16:50:04Z", "likes_count": 153}, {"comment_by": "Tanoshi", "comment_text": "Now I&#39;m convinced that flies have sharingans", "comment_date": "2020-11-27T16:38:42Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "nama anda", "comment_text": "That asian guy who catch flirs with chopsticks :<br>What?
