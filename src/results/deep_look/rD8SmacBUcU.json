Since doing this I have NOT been bitten by a mosquito for about 3 years.  When I would walk my daughter to school in the morning I would get eaten alive by mosquitoes.  I couldn&#39;t even bring my kids to the playground in the evenings because the mosquitoes would attack me immediately;  I would literally go back home with 5-10 bites.  As soon as I started eating the garlic the mosquitoes bites STOPPED !!! Literally.  2 summers ago  I went to the park around 11pm and sat on the bench,  reading from my cell phone. I immediately noticed there were so many mosquitoes swarming around the front of my phone ( due to the light ),  that I had difficulty reading from my phone. I then realized I wasn&#39;t even getting bitten,  not once. They would land on me,  and immediately fly away without biting me. Mosquitoes are repulsed by Garlic,  this is why they won&#39;t bite you. <br><br>This is what to do:<br><br>1) Cut of 1 clove of garlic very finely. <br>2) Let it sit for 15 minutes ( this allows the chemicals in the garlic to mix )<br>3) Scoop up the garlic with a spoon and swallow it with a glass of water.<br>4) Do this 4-5 days a week. <br><br>Note:  Don&#39;t chew the garlic or your breath will smell.  Only swallow it.<br><br>Please trust me that this works.

The common ones belong to Anopheles, Culex, Mansonides, and the one shown here, Aedes. My garden is full of these Aedes aegypti! I&#39;ve seen their babies squiggling in mugs and pots of water left stagnant in bathrooms or our backyard. This is why we always throw out stagnant water in my home. The municipal authorities guys often come and pour some film to cover stagnant lakes and ponds in the neighborhood in the summer months, and sometimes spray adulticides in our garden. This reminds me... it&#39;s April, which means that it&#39;s dengue season in India. My grand-mom sometimes kills mosquitoes using books, and so I often find splotches of dried blood and dead mosquitoes preserved between pages. I don&#39;t kill mosquitoes, because I don&#39;t kill any animals or insects. I believe that prevention is a better approach, so please don&#39;t leave stagnant water lying around. :)", "comment_date": "2020-04-11T21:41:25Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Starqazinqq", "comment_text": "<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rD8SmacBUcU&amp;t=1m41s\">1:41</a> HOW THE HECK DID THEY FILMED THiS", "comment_date": "2020-04-11T14:57:39Z", "likes_count": 1301}, {"comment_by": "Mauro Airaldi", "comment_text": "Veo el video, y me siento picado...", "comment_date": "2020-04-10T21:33:27Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Tanya", "comment_text": "I was watching video concentrated after watching i saw my leg there were hundereds of mosquitoes drinking my blood\ud83d\ude32\ud83d\ude32\ud83d\ude32", "comment_date": "2020-04-10T14:28:48Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "anaya", "comment_text": "<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rD8SmacBUcU&amp;t=1m40s\">1:40</a><br><br><br><br>So u put a camera in someone\u2019s body", "comment_date": "2020-04-10T05:38:44Z", "likes_count": 4}, {"comment_by": "Average Joe", "comment_text": "Nobody:<br><br>Youtube: here is a 3 min video of how people get Malaria", "comment_date": "2020-04-09T17:44:59Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Saran JS", "comment_text": "This is one video which won&#39;t have the words &quot;No mosquitoes were hurt in the making of this short youtube video&quot;.", "comment_date": "2020-04-09T12:57:43Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Solvian", "comment_text": "I just love how they torture they&#39;re test subject just to get a shot of the different deadly mosquitoes", "comment_date": "2020-04-09T07:17:57Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "MOHNDELCRACK Aboukheir", "comment_text": "<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rD8SmacBUcU&amp;t=0m11s\">0:11</a> its not the deadliest animal its the deadliest insect", "comment_date": "2020-04-08T19:06:48Z", "likes_count": 4}, {"comment_by": "everynamewastakenomg", "comment_text": "The only good mosquito is a dead mosquito", "comment_date": "2020-04-08T18:02:24Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "M&M", "comment_text": "THERE&#39;S NO FREE RIDE HERE!!!", "comment_date": "2020-04-08T11:41:49Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Estefano Oversluijs", "comment_text": "I hate those nasty mthkrs!", "comment_date": "2020-04-08T06:23:57Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Gavel Gang", "comment_text": "SHOUT OUT TO THE GUY LENDING HIS HAND FOR THE MOSQUITO TO EAT SO THEY CAN HAVE A YOUTUBE VIDEO.", "comment_date": "2020-04-08T05:26:21Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Hao Chung", "comment_text": "So. . .

The whole universe, with all its living and non-living elements, consists of the signs revealing that they have been &#39;created&#39;. And they exist just in order to demonstrate the power, knowledge, and art of their &#39;Creator&#39;. Mankind is responsible to know these signs and appreciate the Creator of all, Allah. All living things possess these signs, yet there are some specifically mentioned animals in the Qur&#39;an. The mosquito is one of these. This is referred to in the Qur&#39;an in the below verse:<br><br>&quot;Surely Allah is not ashamed to set forth any parable- (that of) a gnat or any thing above that; then as for those who believe, they know that it is the truth from their Lord, and as for those who disbelieve, they say: What is it that Allah means by this parable: He causes many to err by it and many He leads aright by it! but He does not cause to err by it (any) except the transgressors,&quot; [Al-Baqara (The Cow) 26]<br><br>When considering the life of the mosquito, we can say that it has a very extraordinary adventure. What is generally known about mosquitoes is that they absorb and feed on blood. Yet, this is not completely true. Because not all mosquitoes, but only the female ones absorb blood. And their need for blood is actually not related to feeding at all. Actually, both male and female mosquitoes feed on nectar of flowers. The only reason that females, unlike males, do absorb blood is for their eggs, which need to mature with the help of proteins contained in blood. In other words, the female mosquito absorbs blood just to ensure the survival of the new generation.<br><br>The point to be stressed here is that the verse of the Qur&#39;an points out only the &#39;female&#39; mosquito. It is only the female mosquito which has the superior capabilities that will be detailed here. So, it is surely quite expressive that female mosquitoes are particularly emphasized in the Qur&#39;an. Besides, it is a remarkable fact to point out that at the time of the revelation of the Qur&#39;an, the specific biology of the mosquito was knowledge unknown to mankind.", "comment_date": "2018-09-27T20:42:11Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Nayely", "comment_text": "I cringed the whole time I couldn\u2019t even finish the video\ud83e\udd22\ud83e\udd22", "comment_date": "2018-09-27T20:36:37Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Belal TariCk Satti", "comment_text": "I hate Mosquitoes the most, they are really irritating creatures.

A bottle that shoots a stream is good; you can get them on the ceiling and far away.  2.  A hand held vaccuum cleaner  with extension.  Just move it slowly towards them and suck them in.  And use the light on your cell phone if the light is dim in your room.  Remember they like to sit on dark materials, especially your clothes.  If you live in the tropics, use mosquito netting not only on the bed, also doorways, and replace a window pane with screen material.

What people don&#39;t get is that it takes a while and a more than a smattering of water to attract an egg-laying female mosquito. Enough water so that the  eggs have a chance to morph into larvae and the larvae into adults. It takes longer than a few days. A few years back,  I had neighbors who came into my yard and sprinkled pesticides into my birdbaths, as they made their way up to my front door. Idiots. It was another neighbor who was hatching out mossies, not me.  I soon educated these pesticidal neighbors.

If you have one, please take very good care of it.  One pond can breed millions of mosquitos.  Mosquito eating fish are often eaten by birds unless the pond is screened. A tight fly screen cover will stop breeding of mosquitos. <br>Be sure water tanks have flyscreen on both top lid and overflow pipe.  Beware pf plastic sheets or tarps filling up with water. Check your area for breeding sites and encourage neighbours to check their properties. Clean your roof gutters a couple of times a year, and do not allow too much vegetation to constantly fill the gutters. Empty and clean water storage tanks when necessary. <br>If you live near a watercourse, keep an eye out for stagnant pools. They can often be repaired by restoring flow through unblocking channels and so on. Small stagnant ponds can be bailed out and the water used for watering as it is also is a fertile material for dressing pasture or gardens.<br>Animal watering bowls and troughs also need to be kept very clean.", "comment_date": "2018-05-01T09:07:51Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Abraham Yenkel", "comment_text": "reply <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rD8SmacBUcU&amp;t=2m49s\">2:49</a> a couple of times", "comment_date": "2018-04-30T22:15:07Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Mohamed Medhat", "comment_text": "More like one to drink your blood, and five to give you diseases.", "comment_date": "2018-04-30T19:19:22Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "AgilityQueen", "comment_text": "I feel bad for the people in this video who volunteered to get bit by a mosquito", "comment_date": "2018-04-30T05:18:56Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Vj", "comment_text": "love the killing part", "comment_date": "2018-04-29T22:50:23Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "vict iger", "comment_text": "Tengo uno en mi cuarto que hago?", "comment_date": "2018-04-29T09:19:41Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "KING\u3053\u308d\u3093\u3002", "comment_text": "\u4f53\u304c\u304b\u3086\u304f\u306a\u308b\u308f\u203c\ufe0f", "comment_date": "2018-04-29T04:31:09Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Isaac Halley", "comment_text": "<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rD8SmacBUcU&amp;t=2m49s\">2:49</a> rip", "comment_date": "2018-04-28T18:03:51Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "devilmaoo", "comment_text": "soy el unico que ve esto comiendo? ;-;", "comment_date": "2018-04-28T16:44:16Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Smart Novelty", "comment_text": "<a href=\"https://www.smart-novelty.com/products/itch-relief-pen\">https://www.smart-novelty.com/products/itch-relief-pen</a>", "comment_date": "2018-04-28T15:01:35Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "koper10", "comment_text": "G\u0142upie ma\u0142e kurwy kt\u00f3re gryz\u0105 nienawidz\u0119 tego g\u00f3wna", "comment_date": "2018-04-28T12:44:17Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Queen Royalty", "comment_text": "I say a mosquito I go a cardboard box and I hit it hard", "comment_date": "2018-04-26T18:21:08Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Ik weet geen naam", "comment_text": "One time i dead wone lot of blood came out", "comment_date": "2018-04-26T16:45:18Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Wasi Ali Rajput", "comment_text": "Thanks alot for giving me knowledge.", "comment_date": "2018-04-26T15:26:16Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Panto Mimo", "comment_text": "<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rD8SmacBUcU&amp;t=2m48s\">2:48</a> Satisfacci\u00f3n.

Since they could not proceed with construction since disease was so rampant, they looked at how they could solve the problem. One way was to eliminate pools of standing/stagnant water; areas where mosquitoes could breed and spread disease. <br><br>As mentioned in this video, mosquitoes lay their eggs on the surface of standing water and when the larvae hatch, they swim and live just below the surface. Therefore, the &quot;sanitation&quot; effort put forth went out to eliminate standing water where possible(which included draining swamps and ponds) and by spreading oil on the surface of any remaining pools, killing the larvae. Also, they introduced domestic water systems into the area, eliminating the need for rain collection. <br><br>It took about 2 years to prepare and enforce the effort and it ultimately ended in a success. Yellow fever and malaria were completely wiped out of the canal zone, still benefiting the people who live there today.", "comment_date": "2016-06-08T04:50:15Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Angus Hsieh", "comment_text": "I cringed the entire video", "comment_date": "2016-06-08T04:49:00Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Brookelynn Carr", "comment_text": "Welp...
