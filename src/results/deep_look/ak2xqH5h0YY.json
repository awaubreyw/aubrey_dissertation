I just did about a half hour&#39;s research on the topic and can&#39;t wait to share it with you haha. Basically if you don&#39;t know this or haven&#39;t noticed this in nature, animals have two effective ways to mating and staying on this planet and it can be categorized into the r/K theory (and can be coupled with precocial and altricial tendancies in a species but we&#39;ll get to that later). r theory (which I remember by &quot;r is for rapid&quot;) is easily explained by say mosquitos. Mosquitos live for barely weeks at a time but when they do the do they have not only a family but a FAMILY, like hundreds; the same can be said for many insectoid animals and infact many animals hat just have shorter life spans or expectancies. r strategy also involves a much shorter time to gestate before birth and mature into adulthood. And then you have K strategy (which I remember by &quot;k is for kinship&quot;) that is employed by humans, whales, primates, elephants etc (usually larger animals that don&#39;t lay eggs). K strategy is when an animal takes a long time to gestate in order to give birth and a long time for that offspring to develop into maturity. Going back to precocial and altricial however, now that you know the r/K strategy, precocial is defined as already being born with the necessary tools of survival and the know how to use them (as seen in sea turtles, insects and varrying other animals). This means that you have no older matriarchal or patriarchal figure to guide you and teach you to survive in this world as they have either died or gone off to make more tiny thems but it wouldn&#39;t matter becuase you already have the instincts needed to survive. Altricial however, you are born often basically helpless with barely the motor skills to function normally and require one or more parental figures&#39; assistance for a prolonged period of time to learn how to live on your own. The urchin&#39;s method of reproduction is a mixture of K strategy and precocial behavior however which is what made it so interesting, it lives for centuries so it has the ability to raise a lil pupil but its reproductive system is a largely r strategy system. Its young are primarily precocial yet also k strategy though as they take a while to gestate but do so entirely on their own. I hope you learned something from this and if you made it this far then thank you and I would love to read your feed back and opinions on both the subject and my information on the subject.", "comment_date": "2016-11-02T05:48:18Z", "likes_count": 65}, {"comment_by": "The Shaping Sickness", "comment_text": "This is like from another planet, oh how ignorant I am.", "comment_date": "2016-11-01T20:23:26Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Drunk Santa", "comment_text": "one thing:<br>who decides what is reborn and what is a &quot;child&quot;?<br>what are the criterea?", "comment_date": "2016-10-25T18:51:17Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Elizabeth Mortensen", "comment_text": "I love this channel I get to learn cool stuff on it", "comment_date": "2016-10-20T20:24:01Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "chi11 chi11", "comment_text": "Hey Amy.
