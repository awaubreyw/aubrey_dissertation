I always wonder how do you do a story for your videos? Do you script it first and then try to get the pictures that match to your script, or do you take quality pictures as much as possible and then just develop a narration from there? Especially for the videos that can not be filmed in a controlled environment. And how do you decide what subject chosen to be made into a production amongst other subjects?
