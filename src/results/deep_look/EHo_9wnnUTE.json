The ones with the &#39;butterfly&#39; net and little plastic &#39;cage&#39;. And I would catch Dragonflies, and Grasshoppers/Locusts and such, and I would let them bite me as well. I was fascinated by how similar their mouths were. They both had like 4 different &#39;lips&#39;, kind of like a + mark. And the Grasshoppers/Locusts would secrete this brown fluid that smelled weird. And I would put leaves in their mouth, and watch how that brown fluid would help break it down, but how the fluid had no impact on my skin as it did with the leaves. It was really interesting to me.<br>I would also catch spiders, and I would put a piece of cardboard down the middle of the bug catcher cage. Then I would take the cardboard out, and watch the spiders fight each other. A lot of the times they didn&#39;t fight though, surprisingly. And then whenever any bug I had died, I would put them in this Barbie Doll Mansion house I had, and I would trace their bodies with marker/sharpie, and write down their name under it. That doll house looked like a crime scene, with a lot of murders haha. But I was more of a TomBoy, and didn&#39;t play with my dolls, I would just destroy them, and would play with bugs instead.
