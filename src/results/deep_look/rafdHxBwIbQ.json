They stake out a patch where they do most of their courting and act aggressively towards rival males. He&#39;s the ruff bird&#39;s equivalent to the Orange Throats.<br>The Satellite male: The second of the two primary males, making up 16% of males in the group. Smaller and more submissive than the Territorial male, he&#39;s pretty similar to the Yellow Throats in that he mostly hangs around the Territorial males and sneakily mates with the females that the Territorial males stock up on.<br>Now naturally, this causes some conflict between the two males. But there&#39;s a third variety who (I guess) acts as a loose parallel to the Blue Throats and keeps the harmony between them: The Faeder male.<br>The Faeder male is a permanent female mimic, having the dull, bland plumage of the female instead of the flamboyant plumage of the males and is much smaller than his two counterparts. He&#39;s also rarer, making up 1% of the males in the trio. The interesting thing about the Faeder male is that he&#39;ll often allow the other two males to mate with <i>him</i> as well. This was originally thought to be a mistake on the other males&#39; parts...until it was shown that they too will let him mate with them, showing that they&#39;re well aware of the fact that he&#39;s a male bird. And he will also mate with the females that they attract sometimes, and indeed, the female ruff birds seem to prefer him to the other two males.<br>Now how does this keep the harmony between them? Well, hilariously enough, the homosexual activity between the three varieties of male ruff birds actually <i>attracts more females to the males!</i> That&#39;s right, the female ruff birds are basically a species-wide example of <i>yaoi fangirls!</i> The more same-sex mating the males engage in, the more females find them attractive. So this way all three male varieties can find plenty of females to mate with and conflicts are kept to a minimum because they&#39;re all...(ahem), &quot;working&quot; together to get some!", "comment_date": "2017-06-10T23:22:22Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Purple Emerald", "comment_text": "So...are these all &quot;subspecies&quot;?

Also developing unique strategies weather changing appearance or developing unique physical attributes or color is also known as adapting not evolution.
