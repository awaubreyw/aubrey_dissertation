Jesus died that we could be saved. He is actually the only way to get to Heaven. If we put our faith in Jesus Christ and follow God and do his will, repent, be Baptized, and join the true Church of believers following the Bible, we can be saved. The best part, if we honestly seek him and ask, he can come into our lives and give us everything we need to follow him and live lives that are so much more fulfilling  and we can be saved and have everlasting life in Heaven with God. I hope you will consider it and see for yourself the truth of all this.
