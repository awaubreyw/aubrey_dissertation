[{"comment_by": "Gabriela Quiros", "comment_text": "Hello Deep Look fans! I produced this episode. Thank you for watching! A few of you have asked how adult blue orchard bees get out of the nest. Jim Cane, a native bee ecologist at the US Department of Agriculture, explained that adults chew their way out of their tough cocoon and then keep on chewing to pass through the mud partitions and ultimately the mud closure of the nest. Like all bees, the female blue orchard bee gets to choose the sex of each offspring \u2013 fertilized eggs become females; unfertilized eggs become males. She puts female eggs at the back of the nest and males at the front. Most females mate only once, so males that are late to the game will have fewer offspring. That\u2019s why adult males of all solitary bees emerge a few days to a week before the females. An emerged bee will be patient and wait for a few days for the next in line to exit. If its sibling doesn\u2019t emerge because it has died, the bee will eat through its sibling\u2019s cocoon and keep going. Thanks for your questions! \u2013Gabriela", "comment_date": "2018-08-07T22:11:58Z", "likes_count": 9140}, {"comment_by": "MERRILL MAIL", "comment_text": "Do Tay bite or sting", "comment_date": "2022-08-20T17:16:00Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Werner", "comment_text": "The absolute best videos on the net.
