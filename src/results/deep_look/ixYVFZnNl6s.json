[{"comment_by": "Kaeli Swift", "comment_text": "Hi folks!  I&#39;m the scientist behind this research.  I&#39;m seeing a few questions come up repeatedly so let me take a minute to address them. 1) Yikes, why are the masks so creepy?! These masks were made in service to the original facial recognition study that took place a little over a decade ago at the UW.  You can learn more about that study in the PBS &#39;Murder of Crows&#39; special which is free to stream.  When asking that original question of &quot;do crows recognize threatening people&quot; it was important that the masks were expressionless, since a happy or angry looking face might influence how they would respond (we now know it actually doesn&#39;t). It&#39;s very hard to find human-like expressionless masks though, so we had costume makers come in and take molds of volunteers&#39; faces.  What you&#39;re left with is something that basically looks like you cut someone&#39;s face off and are wearing it Silence of the Lambs style, which is kinda the point, but admittedly also very creepy to people!  2) Why did you need to wear masks at all? During the actual study I wasn&#39;t a mask wearer, I just recorded data.  It was a volunteer that would don the mask and hold the crow, or return a week later wearing the familiar mask.  But volunteers are fickle and I couldn&#39;t be guaranteed that the person available to help during the &quot;funeral&quot; presentation could come back the following week.  By having people wear the masks though, it didn&#39;t matter who was helping me, I could keep the face the same.  And based on the previous facial recognition study I knew that&#39;s really all that mattered.  3) How did we know they weren&#39;t just freaking out because the masks are creepy?  I ran controls to verify this. Linda is one of ten different masks so it was easy to verify that wasn&#39;t what was going on.  If you want to learn all the details of this study you can read it for free on my blog (corvidreseach . blog)  You can also find me on twitter @ corvidresearch where I am always available to answer all your corvid questions.  I also play a fun ID game on Wednesdays called <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23CrowOrNo\">#CrowOrNo</a>.  I&#39;m glad so many of you enjoyed the video and I hope you look out for my new studies!", "comment_date": "2018-05-18T21:18:29Z", "likes_count": 12971}, {"comment_by": "krista miller", "comment_text": "Whenever Halloween arrives, I&#39;ll see so many of them perched on a old dead tree.", "comment_date": "2022-08-26T21:51:41Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "R A", "comment_text": "I got terrified watching this video.", "comment_date": "2022-08-25T17:34:34Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Muhammad Indra Fathanul Hafizh", "comment_text": "Crow is literally a real depiction of Skyrim guards, when you committed a crime, you either pay the fine (peanut) or pay with your blood.", "comment_date": "2022-08-21T00:59:45Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "John Smith", "comment_text": "I went to my black neighbors funeral.
