There are a couple of issues I suggest you address. Firstly, some of the trees and their cones shown are not, as they are described in the video, actually pines. The cone on a hemlock is not a pine cone, it is a hemlock cone. The tallest trees on earth do not reproduce with pine cones, they reproduce with redwood cones (for that matter, redwoods are not, as the video states, the largest living things on Earth; there are fungi that dwarf redwoods!). It is true that cones are fairly primitive compared to flowering plant reproduction, but compared to moss and fern reproduction, conifer sex is pretty advanced. It is a stretch to label cone reproduction with a blanket label of &quot;primitive&quot;. Cone reproduction is fairly advanced in many ways. I think the quality of the imagery, production, and narration of these videos deserves an equally valid look into the core science being presented.
