[{"comment_by": "Deep Look", "comment_text": "Looks like there are lots of questions about how exactly male earwigs with more asymmetric pincers to their advantage during fights.According to Mu\u00f1oz and Zink, earwigs slide the straighter side under their opponent and then bring down the the tip of their more curved side onto the top of their opponent\u2019s abdomen. So instead of just grabbing their opponent, they are now poking them with the point of that curved side. Sometimes they apply enough pressure to actually penetrate their opponent\u2019s abdomen, which is usually a fatal injury.

I started panicking as I could hear something moving around. Ten minutes later, after nearly ripping my ear off, I finally felt it and pulled it out. Sure enough it was a big ole&#39; earwig. I had to go to the doctor the next morning and get ear drops. He said my eardrum was bleeding from it cutting me up with its pincers.

It is actually true, sorry guys.<br><br>The thing is, ear-wigs are not your only concern in this regards, there are actually quite a few insects that have (likewise) been found inhabiting the ears of humans. A human ear can be an nice place for many insects especially if the human is sleeping and the ear appears to be a natural, warm, moist opening for them to crawl into.<br><br>It&#39;s not completely uncommon and unheard of although it is still (relatively speaking) very uncommon for bugs to crawl into ears. My point is that its not unprecedented I suppose. Although the origins seem somewhat cloudy, it is most likely that the reason this particular animal has this reputation is because its one of the more populous and common animals in the places it inhabits and they often inhabit houses, are of a more reasonable size to get into our ears etc.<br><br>It&#39;s almost certainly just built up over time in these civilisations as more cases were reported of this happening, some of those cases may have even been misattributed to ear-wigs when in fact they were other bugs.<br><br>If you want to (I would recommend not doing this though because its often highly uncomfortable to watch) you can actually quite easily find videos of many bugs inside human ears, some extraction videos and the like.<br><br>I think people would like to believe that its not something that&#39;s possible but why not? Why doesn&#39;t it make sense for an insect to crawl into your ear and set up base there? It does make sense, even if it just crawls in and then basically gets stuck or disoriented etc. Even spiders have been known to do it on occasion.<br><br>Reality and the world is much less sanitary, safe, clean and soft than humans like to think and people tend to think that bad things won&#39;t happen to them until they do. Everyone thinks that they will never get cancer, but some people get cancer. <br><br>This is just how the majority of humans are, its weirdly naive and often borne from ignorance, its like many people just think that they are the main character and that horrors cannot befall them but it is the human condition to experience the suffering of life and realise you are just as susceptible to the brutal reality as everyone else. <br><br>In the modern age we&#39;re so detached from true reality and the real experience of nature that we often do not encounter these types of things as much but the underlying savagery and unfairness inherent in life is always lurking beneath the surface and if you go to (say) a rainforest with burrowing creatures it isn&#39;t that unlikely at all that you may come back infested with some.<br><br>Leave your cities and safe zones, travel into the wilderness unprepared, with no medicine, no precautions (probably a bad idea anyway) and you are definitely going to end up with infections, parasites, perhaps burrowing creatures, diseases. There are still many places you can go today and experience these horrors first hand if you want to, but I suppose there isn&#39;t a reason for us to do so.<br><br>However, whether experiencing them first hand or not its still ignorant and childish to dismiss these realities because you prefer not to think about them. Now our houses are such that most of the time insects are generally not really present, our walls have no holes, our houses are sanitised and unfit for most insects etc. etc.<br><br>If you imagine a time closer to the more brutish and harrowing realities of nature that humanity lived with for thousands of years (or as I said that still exist in many parts of untamed nature), even only as far back as hundreds of years it was probably much more likely, just from the sufferings of humans and our relative lack of understanding, technology, security etc. that this sort of thing occurred more often.<br><br>It is highly likely, based on the fact that these animals share similar names in almost all places they are found, that they have a higher predilection for human ears than most bugs and that instances of them crawling into sleeping human&#39;s ears was more common.<br><br>People talk about them &quot;burrowing into brains&quot; which seems to be embellishments to make stories more interesting since that is highly unlikely (if not impossible) but having a bug living in your ear is likely to cause you a bunch of problems and many people who have bugs in their ears report headaches and other such symptoms. <br><br>It can be unclear that there is a bug in your ear sometimes, and people may only realise after a short while, but in reported cases of these things happening most often people seem to experience ear pain and discomfort similar to an ear infection, and it may just be that the presence of the bug is not really natural for our ears so they do induce more types of infections etc. <br><br>Anyway, yeah, even though it might not happen THAT often, its almost certainly where they got their name. People didn&#39;t just randomly name stuff like this. Sure, the stories will be overblown in that its almost certainly never going to happen to you but that doesn&#39;t mean that it hasn&#39;t happened to others and that it couldn&#39;t happen to you no matter how unlikely. <br><br>Ear-wigs are called ear-wigs because they do actually go inside human ears.
