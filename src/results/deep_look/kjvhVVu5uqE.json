As far down as scientists can reach on the tree of life, viruses have been shuttling genes. Darwin may have envisioned the history of life as a tree. But the history of genes, at least among the ocean\u2019s microbes and their viruses, is more like a bustling trade network, its webs reaching back billions of years.<br><br>To test this idea, Thierry Heidmann, a researcher at the Gustave Roussy Institute in Villejuif, France, tried to bring a human endogenous retrovirus back to life. Searching through the genomes of different people, he and his colleagues found slightly different versions of one retrovirus-like segment. These differences presumably arose after a retrovirus became trapped in the genomes of ancient humans.<br><br>Over millions of years, our genomes have picked up a vast amount of DNA from dead viruses. Each of us carries almost a hundred thousand fragments of endogenous retrovirus DNA in our genome, making up about 8 percent of our DNA. To put that figure in perspective, consider that the twenty thousand protein-coding genes in the human genome make up only 1.2 percent of our DNA. Scientists have also observed millions of smaller pieces of \u201cjumping DNA\u201d in the human genome. It\u2019s possible that many of those pieces evolved from endogenous retrovirus, having been stripped down to the bare essentials required for copying DNA.", "comment_date": "2020-11-10T15:06:09Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Sjc", "comment_text": "I am fond of these kinds of videos but please drop out videos more frequently really appreciated pressed the like button before starting the video,,\ud83d\ude00\ud83d\ude00", "comment_date": "2020-11-10T15:04:17Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "War plane", "comment_text": "I love science", "comment_date": "2020-11-10T15:03:00Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Fishmark Holmes", "comment_text": "More video please", "comment_date": "2020-11-10T14:59:55Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Patrick", "comment_text": "Ohhh an underwater caterpillar", "comment_date": "2020-11-10T14:56:12Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Naznin Akther", "comment_text": "The title is such a tongue twister xD", "comment_date": "2020-11-10T14:55:06Z", "likes_count": 2}, {"comment_by": "flaming flamingo", "comment_text": "Like if you find sea hares cute!!", "comment_date": "2020-11-10T14:54:30Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "TinaxLynn", "comment_text": "Ok, but that baby sea hare did me in! \ud83d\udc97\ud83d\udc97\ud83d\udc97", "comment_date": "2020-11-10T14:53:49Z", "likes_count": 187}, {"comment_by": "Ari_Potatons", "comment_text": "<b>the ealgrass hare rhinophores looks like shrek :&#39;)</b>", "comment_date": "2020-11-10T14:53:48Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "6B MUHAMAD AMIRUL HAFIZ BIN ROZALI HAFIZ BIN ROZALI", "comment_text": "Awesome and helpful sea bunnies!", "comment_date": "2020-11-10T14:52:23Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Marcus User", "comment_text": "a cute and squishy slug that i didnt know it exsits", "comment_date": "2020-11-10T14:52:16Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Silas", "comment_text": "Can you do more external parasite videos?", "comment_date": "2020-11-10T14:50:47Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Ishidalover", "comment_text": "Props to the musician(s) for this show!
