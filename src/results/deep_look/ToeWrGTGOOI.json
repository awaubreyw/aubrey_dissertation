That is killing the bugs and it&#39;s eggs with &quot;Isopropyl Alcohol&quot; 70% or 91%. Put the Alcohol in a spray bottle that has a adjustable spraying nozzle. You&#39;re going to take your bed mattress up off its box mattress or the platform of your bed.<br>Spray and saturate the whole mattress making it wet to touch insuring where eggs are concealed the Alcohol will kill them. Do this on all sides and top of your mattress too. Do this too the box mattress or your platform bed also. Vacuum the floor around your bed too and sray it down with Alcohol and let it dry than revacuum your floor. <br>Next you are going need &quot;Clove Oil&quot; which can be a little hard to find in some area&#39;s and expensive. But no worries you can still you use  &quot;Ground Cloves seasoning&quot; it will still work well. Take the Clove powder and generously sprinkle all over your mattresses and floor.

Better to treat the house, bedding, etc. when dealing with fleas. You can deworm pets with DE. Just an option, I have used it for years!

I don&#39;t know how we got bed bugs again but my guess is the junk my dad brought over. I woke up one night and found 6 of them, killed them. When I wake up I never see bite marks and I see people online with tons all over their legs or bodies. They hide and only come out when your in a deep sleep, something about the air you breathe out during a deep sleep is different then the air you breathe out awake, so that&#39;s how they know it&#39;s time to head out and suck blood. That&#39;s another reason why you don&#39;t feel a thing. I&#39;m not racist but the Chinese brought bed bugs to America and the rest of the world. That&#39;s why when you first arrive to jail, which ever block or section they send you will have a inmate or prisoner that&#39;s the leader of the block.

We been having lines like this for the last two weeks. He explained the banning of DDT I belive it was or DDX and that the bugs have made a huge come back especially in the tourist industry and I just happened to go cruise that year and yes I did find them there. But this guy I gotta say made a killing at the counter, remember theirs a line almost out the door. He first made us buy spray for the eggs, another to kill the bugs and one last one which I had no idea what it was for. The order in sequence to use the spray also was confusing but at the end the bill was huge, just under $200.00. Then you figure 200 to beat these things but at least we will win...ooops! No! Just as we are ready to go he now tells us that doing this process once won&#39;t get rid of the problem which means more money, he says we need to do it at least two more times till all the bugs are dead and eggs are done. Oh and just one last thing, his last injury to insult...you guys, meaning us people that was there for the bedbugs, you guys are gonna have to take everything that&#39;s infected and sarran wrap it then throw it out. All your cloths must be put in garbage bags and thrown out...i remember looking around the crowd to see thier reactions to check if they were feeling what I was feeling and every mouth was open wide, every expression was the same, stunned in stone. I never knew or really heard of bedbugs before this crisis only in a nursery rym but who knew the emotional destruction, kaos, financial destruction, and sheer panic this little bug no bigger then a match head would cause. A few months latter it got so bad in the city that I remember reading in one paper how one guys house was so bad he had to sleep on his masseuse table and greese the table legs so they wouldn&#39;t get to him. One night he says, he&#39;s watching one climing the wall, makes it to the ceiling, walks across the middle, stops right at were he is on the table reading, then calmly adjusted itself to where the man center of mass was and incredibly to his surprise jumped down onto him. I&#39;ll tell you if true, then that&#39;s where we drew the line. I know at the present we thankfully in the East Coast have it under control. Now if one apartment gets it here in NYC three units manditorly have to be exterminated which is good.

I used three tactics that have worked every time. 1. Wrapping mattress and boxspring in the thick Moving Plastic that comes on on brand new mattresses and taping up any breathing holes in the plastic with duct tape. The Bug resistant pillow covers work well, but the ones they make for mattresses have too much stitching and folds that bedbugs still can nest in. So just straight plastic. 2. Using a microfiber blanket with no seams or stitched ribbing. 3. Spray everything down with straight rubbing alcohol until damp. It not only will dissolve the critters and their eggs, but it also drys them out internally. If the alcohol doesn&#39;t work immediately spray a little more. 1-2 saturating sprays will kill them dead. NOTE: a fourth trick that can be used is to fill four tuna cans just little bit with rubbing alcohol and place those under your bed post leg. This prevents the bugs from even being able to get to your bed. But do this along with the plastic, microfiber blanket. There are sites and articles that claim that the alcohol doesn&#39;t work, But I&#39;m telling you, it does, and you&#39;ll always notice that those sites are trying to sell you some other product or service.", "comment_date": "2020-08-05T05:43:27Z", "likes_count": 4}, {"comment_by": "Makoto Naegi", "comment_text": "&#39;Heat kills them&#39;<br>Me: aight, <b>warms mouth with saliva, and sucks on bedbugs</b>", "comment_date": "2020-08-05T03:55:56Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "ahna_shenanigans", "comment_text": "You all knew that you would be disturbed after watching the video, yet you still clicked it.", "comment_date": "2020-08-05T03:46:55Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "__________________________________________________", "comment_text": "Ima show this video to people who die immediately when they see a bug", "comment_date": "2020-08-04T13:54:32Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "garry kimovich", "comment_text": "I feel sad for the little bed bugs with their legs stuck. lol", "comment_date": "2020-08-04T05:43:40Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "exoticmage", "comment_text": "I recently got a bed bug bite in my leg and this is giving me anxiety", "comment_date": "2020-08-03T02:13:28Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Bernie Boiii", "comment_text": "Well I didn\u2019t want to sleep anyway", "comment_date": "2020-08-02T22:48:48Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Stealth Productionz", "comment_text": "One time I had bed bugs and somehow I killed the entire family and I havent seen them since.

They cant climb thru vaseline and they get stuck on duct tape. If they cant get to you to feed off you they starve and die. I would also recommend diachotomus earth food grade, found at Walmart or any feed store for livestock and sprinkle around baseboards of every room and leave it for a month or so. It will cut them to pieces when they walk thru it and they will bleed out and die.
