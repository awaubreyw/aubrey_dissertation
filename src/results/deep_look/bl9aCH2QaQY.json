Man, I can&#39;t think of anything that I&#39;d mistake these for other than another toxic Amanita species, or maybe a puffball if the Amanita is just a button. The button Amanita being mistaken for a puffball is a well known mistake, but all puffballs must be cut in half to inspect before consumption anyway, and that reveals it&#39;s actually an Amanita, as their structure is entirely different. It&#39;s silly to think scientist can eradicate this fungus from California after all these years. People just need to actually do due diligence. I know because I forage and consume or otherwise use probably two dozen species of mushroom. I&#39;m not an expert, but I know enough to think I know something I don&#39;t and make a mistake. However, I learned by always checking and rechecking to make certain I&#39;ve not slipped into a confused deadly mistake. It can and likely will happen if people don&#39;t carefully check for toxic lookalikes, or bother with carefully inspecting each individual mushroom harvested from a place of plenty. Spore printing can often be key, and should always be practiced if there&#39;s any doubt. Until doubt has been eliminated methodically, the mushroom must not be consumed. It&#39;s like handling firearms, but far less dangerous. Don&#39;t take chances, don&#39;t assume you know it&#39;s unloaded or loaded, check it out methodically. It can be tricky bussiness, especially if you travel to a an unfamiliar geographic region, with unfamiliar toxic look alikes. Always give them to somebody you don&#39;t particularly care for first.

The mushroom&#39;s poison only becomes poison once it enters the liver, because it is the liver that changes it to a poison. It is a very unique situation. It isn&#39;t poison until it is converted by the liver. Thankfully because of this, there is a plant seed that allows the poison to go into the kidneys instead. Protecting the liver from making this fatal mistake. It is the milk thistle seed (Silybum marianum). You do need to take a fairly good amount from what I hear. I could be mistaken on this. But is good to know if so. S. Todd Mitchell of Dominican Hospital in Santa Cruz, Calif., and his team have treated more than 60 patients suffering from amatoxin poisonings. Every patient who still had intact kidney function and was started on the drug within 96 hours of eating mushrooms has lived. Only a few patients sought treatment later and did not survive so you have hurry obviously. Hope this helps anyone out there. This is information I researched, I am not a physician.

The common wild mushroom, Amanita phalloides, is known as the &quot;death cap&quot; for a good reason. It takes only a handful of this widely distributed fungus to kill an adult, less to kill a child. Standard medical treatment - activated charcoal - is not particularly effective. Amanita phalloides mushroom ingestion proves fatal in about half of the cases. Twenty years ago, pilot studies showed that silymarin [milk thistle extract] treatment substantially reduced amanita-poisoning deaths in animals fed the mushroom. Subsequently, several human studies were launched. In one German hospital test, 60 consecutive people with amanita poisoning were given intravenous silymarin [milk thistle extract]. None died. With the rise of the modem pharmaceutical industry, U.S. research of herbal medicines declined considerably. Fortunately, this did not happen in Germany, where in 1949, scientists noticed that milk thistle seemed to protect animal livers from poisoning with highly toxic carbon tetrachloride. In 1968, scientists isolated the three specific liver-protective molecules in milk thistle - silibinin, silidianin, and silicristin - now known collectively as silymarin [milk thistle extract]. From what David Hoffmann, clinical herbalist, says is that the United States is the only ones that do not have it in their official pharmacopeia.", "comment_date": "2019-11-12T04:47:43Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "maryam aslam", "comment_text": "I love watching your videos these are awesome.<br>Keep it up", "comment_date": "2019-11-11T21:55:10Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Mark's Drawing Tutorials", "comment_text": "ALL NATURAL!<br>100% ORGANIC!", "comment_date": "2019-11-11T18:47:39Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "The grand army of ducks", "comment_text": "Moral of the story:<br><br>Never go outside.<br><br>EVER.", "comment_date": "2019-11-10T02:41:31Z", "likes_count": 278}, {"comment_by": "SeBu", "comment_text": "I just know one thing ... spores are bad and infected by mushrooms will breaksmy both arms.

Death caps tend to grow specifically around the bases of tree root crowns the radius of a trees root system closest to the surface. This is also coincidentally where Truffles also tend grow.

If you look for boletus species, you better should know the few toxic ones, in particular the Satans bolete (at least that&#39;s not very toxic). You may also think about toxic variants of the shaggy parasol (some can eat them), and be careful. And not to forget: There are quite some more deadly toxic things in the forest...

The seeds contain the highest concentrations of the active compound, silymarin. Silymarin is an antioxidant that reduces free radical production and oxidative damage. It may also inhibit the binding of toxins to the liver. In animals, silymarin reduces liver injury caused by acetaminophen and has been shown to have positive effects on alcoholic liver disease, hepatitis and toxin-induced liver problems. To keep the amatoxins from causing damage silymarin would have to protect the liver while the kidneys eliminated the poison. Silibinin, a drug derived from the plant milk thistle,\u00a0Silybum marianum, when administered intravenously, the compound sits on and blocks the receptors that bring amatoxin into the liver, thus corralling the amatoxins into the blood stream so the kidneys can expel them faster. The kidneys can continue to function only if the victim stays hydrated.<br><br>S. Todd Mitchell of Dominican Hospital in Santa Cruz, Calif., and his team have treated more than 60 patients suffering from amatoxin poisonings.
