Simply <b>stunning!</b> I knew how it all works, but when I am missing the little Canadian gosling that we rescued and delivered to a waterfowl rescue place a few years ago (has it really been over 5 years?!?), I hunt down things waterfowl-related to watch. <br><br>Before anyone claims I didn&#39;t know what I was doing, that her mom was probably just off eating, let me explain a few things. I understand birds. I&#39;ve raised chickens, ducks, quail, guinea fowl, turkeys, and geese successfully, for years. I get the whole &quot;mom went to get some food, the chicks will be fine&quot; thing. I do. I have seen it time and again. However, I&#39;ve had to explain this SO often, so I&#39;ll get it over ahead of time...<br><br>We had a tornado rip through the countryside between our home and my sister-in-law&#39;s home; passing really close her house &amp; near/over a fee small lakes. Next morning, my sister-in-law discovered a lone little gosling (I estimate perhaps as young as 2 days), walking down the dirt road past SIL&#39;s home, crying as loud as she could for mama. No mama in sight, muddy and chilled, and as soon as she saw my sister-in-law, she sped up and ran straight at her. I assume an instinct told her that something larger than her would be needed so she could get help. This being March, SIL was amazed the gosling even survived overnight alone! <br><br>She came right up to SIL, kept begging, and wouldn&#39;t leave her side. When SIL moved (she was doing chores), the gosling followed her. SIL moves again, gosling follows again. So, it was clear to SIL she was stuck with a bird she knew nothing about &amp; was in over her head, so she got hold of me.<br><br>I picked up the adorable little girl, set up an area for her with food &amp; water, and started looking for the best waterfowl rehabber in the area. Got hold of a friend who used to rehab wildlife, herself (mammals), knew one personally, and enthusiastically suggested her. We named the gosling Dandelion Daffodil, as the dandelions seemed to be her favorite thing to chomp on from the yard, it was still blooming season for daffodils, and she still had the yellow tone in her fluff; it seemed to fit. \ud83d\ude04  That was the name she was taken in with, too! \ud83d\ude0d <br><br>To make a long story slightly less long than it would&#39;ve been, I only got not quite 5 full days with Dandelion, but it was long enough to fall in love with her! She grew up, migrated with the rest of the geese there, and came back to the rehab release point the following season! She was doing great the last time I checked in with them, too. \ud83e\udd86\u2764 They only follow them for 5 years,  so I won&#39;t know when her story ends, but they can live to 15 years old (older in captivity, but that&#39;s not a normal life), so I will just assume, from here on out, she will live a continued long, happy life!<br><br>Good grief, sorry that was so long!

Repent and believe in the gospel, He is the ONLY way to heaven. You can\u2019t get into heaven by doing good works and you don\u2019t have to go to a priest to confess anything. Cry out to Him through prayer He will not turn you away.  Dive into His word (The Bible) for guidance and do not continue in your sins.
