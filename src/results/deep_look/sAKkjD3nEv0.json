Most industrial bees are slaughtered during their work due to parasites, pesticides and their unnatural relationship with us and the corporate world. Millions will be crushed by the workers handling them.<br>2. Honey Bees are an invasive species from Europe and native bees pollinate better than them.<br>3. Einstein&#39;s quote was not about honey bees. Humans have no need for honey and especially the species that produces it.<br>4. Make no mistake, we <b>STEAL</b> their food. Not only the honey but the pollen, royal jelly etc. They <b>DO NOT</b> make an over abundance and are given sugar water by workers who then steal their natural food they worked extremely hard for.<br>5. Honey bees are tricked into overworking by industry putting multiple queens to one hive making them think they have to produce more than they do.<br>6. Honey bees are extremely complex and social species, they have complicated brains which we still don&#39;t fully understand and yet these unnatural working environments cause colony collapse disorder. When a colony undergoes this, it is simply burned up and the next colony is put to work.<br>7. It is virtually impossible to buy &#39;ethical honey&#39; as the overwhelming majority of it comes from the honey industry which is obviously more interested in the product than the producer. Please do your research.<br><br><br>When we see cute, lighthearted videos like this we can generally ignore the horror that lies in the actuality. No bees were harmed in the making of this video, so no problem right? Yet let us not become numb to the reality of the honey bee industrial complex.
