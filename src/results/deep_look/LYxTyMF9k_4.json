Maybe the wings are to confuse the &quot;&quot;&quot;predatory&quot;&quot;&quot; birds so they don&#39;t know what they&#39;re pecking at? Maybe the pattern is actually some form of camouflage, to break up it&#39;s shape? Maybe it&#39;s a vestigial trait that the butterfly could soon loose 100% to become even more transparent, but just not yet? Maybe the wings need to be hardened by the pigmented tips, like seagull wings?
