Not the hugest fan of spiders but these don&#39;t bother me (in fact I like them), even though they look similar and have eight legs. Probably because they don&#39;t produce silk and they&#39;re pretty chill and don&#39;t move super fast. Haven&#39;t seen one in the wild in years, though. Side note: &quot;daddy longlegs&quot; that fly are crane flies (they can also detach legs), and &quot;daddy longlegs&quot; that build webs in the corners of your basement or garage are cellar spiders (which are also chill, so I don&#39;t mind them either).", "comment_date": "2020-10-02T04:59:06Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Pompieru' Fancy", "comment_text": "When he loses a leg he is like<br><b>Oh no</b><br>Anyway", "comment_date": "2020-10-01T17:45:40Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "jack lawrence", "comment_text": "Well that definitely ain\u2019t a daddy long legs", "comment_date": "2020-10-01T16:34:10Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "linandy1", "comment_text": "I feel a little bad about them loosing legs.", "comment_date": "2020-10-01T06:55:45Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Nappy Cat", "comment_text": "<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tjDmH8zhp6o&amp;t=3m06s\">3:06</a><br><br><br><br><br>Get daddy long leg&#39;d lol", "comment_date": "2020-09-30T21:45:55Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Spiral Animations", "comment_text": "<b>STOP TAKING ITS FUCKEN LEGS OFF!!</b>", "comment_date": "2020-09-30T20:07:58Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "SaltyWorlds", "comment_text": "Oh really when it has only have one leg left are u sure it can handle any thing", "comment_date": "2020-09-30T16:50:46Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "SaltyWorlds", "comment_text": "Wow really It can handle every thing I throw at them I can throw a match or a shoe when I throw or stoping it", "comment_date": "2020-09-30T16:48:58Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "James Pigeon", "comment_text": "dont feel bad for them, (is getting legs ripped off)", "comment_date": "2020-09-30T12:15:54Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "MisterLister SisterWhisper", "comment_text": "Why torture the creature?", "comment_date": "2020-09-30T09:42:33Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Robert Baker", "comment_text": "Now I know why I always see these with missing legs, thanks YouTube \ud83d\ude0a", "comment_date": "2020-09-29T12:43:01Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "lokis Mischief", "comment_text": "I went moth surveying one night with a group of local entomologists and saw literally hundreds of these little cuties.<br>I always liked them, but became truly endeared to them that evening.", "comment_date": "2020-09-28T16:12:00Z", "likes_count": 19}, {"comment_by": "Michael Fisher", "comment_text": "Wow.

These are actually spiders. They have never harmed humans, but it is speculated that the rumor started because they manage to trap and kill deadly spiders in their webs. You will find black widows and brown recluse that they have killed. I could see why some people would see that and assume \u201cthey must be deadly.\u201d\r<br>Next we have Opiliones these are the Harvestman from this video. The video does a great job of explaining them though.<br>Finally, we have the Crane Fly. They seem to commonly be called Daddy Longlegs in the UK, though I&#39;ve heard them called that where I live in the US as well. They are a type of fly with characteristic very long legs.<br>So one of the reasons people say daddy longlegs are a spider, or that they can fly, or that they can or can&#39;t regrow legs is because they are three different creatures.

And how does the woman know that the daddy long legs just lets go of the notion of losing its legs as if its fine with losing legs? If they deliberately amputate their legs to avoid certain death it&#39;s obvious they would have no problem with that because the other alternative is that it dies completely so losing a leg or two to avoid completely dying from a predator isn&#39;t a big deal because they are still alive. But people taking their legs off for experimentation and acting like the daddy long legs is OK with it is not cool. It dont matter if your just holding its legs in order to activate its predator-danger mechanism to pinch off its own legs for the purpose of escaping a predator, ur tricking it into instinctively feeling its in danger by grabbing it leg so that it activates its defense mechanism to pinch its leg off just so you can experimentally observe it with less legs.
