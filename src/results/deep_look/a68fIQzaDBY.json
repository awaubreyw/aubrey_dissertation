Owls have fourteen neck vertebrates that allow them to move<br> their head at 270 degrees, left to right.The color of these <br>birds varies with the area in which they are found. Canadian and Pacific<br> Northwest Great Horned owls are very dark, while the birds found in <br>arid regions are usually very sandy in color. In the Arctic they are <br>practically white.If a Great Horned owl was the same size as a human, its eyes would be as big as oranges.Great<br> Horned owls take life-long mates. They won\u2019t build a nest together, but<br> will raise their young in the abandoned nests of other birds such as hawks, eagles and crows.Flocks<br> of American crows are known to harass the Great Horned Owl, pestering <br>it for hours or until the owl leaves. The crow&#39;s hostility is <br>well-earned as the owl is a major predator to their nestlings and <br>adults. Other small bird species, such as swallows, are also known for <br>this behavior.Great Horned owl is the only animals that eat skunks.
