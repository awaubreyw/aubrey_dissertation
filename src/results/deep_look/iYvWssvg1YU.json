I ve bn going to the same bch every spring during the full n new moon tides for over 15 years in NJ!! I used to fish there but it\u2019s impossible to do that during these spawns, so now l jst go w a couple close friends, to take in this spectacle n to help the exhausted , upside down n stranded Horseshoe crabs back to the water !! It\u2019s very sad watching them struggle to flip themselves back over n eventually, due to exhaustion, lack of oxygen or moisture they die !! I have another concern n l\u2019m hoping maybe someone can let me knw the answer !! In the last 3 to 4 years we\u2019 bn seeing more n more females covered in big barnacles n other nasty freeloading creatures, excuse my lack of proper names for these things , but sme are so encrusted in these things that their eyes are covered , their hinges aren\u2019t moving right!!! Will it harm the horseshoe crabs if we remove sme of these things, is really what l wnt to knw ?? It\u2019s nver discused in any video or written discussion that l cn find!! Any info would be greatly appreciated!! We spend frm 6-10hrs a night helping these amazing creatures!! If there\u2019s more we can do for them, we are all in!!
