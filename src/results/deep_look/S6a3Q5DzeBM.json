It&#39;s a sensor with seismic capabilities that allows to &quot;hear&quot; the tree trunk vibrations coming from the larvae at the time of eating. With a special AI algorithm we can tell if the &quot;noises&quot; detected by the sensors are being made by a pest larvae or not and send a very early notification to the palm owner to act accordingly. <br>So, in one hand we have early detection long before the damage made by the pest is irreversible while in the other hand, we help reducing sustainably the amount of pesticides used indiscriminately to protect trees that may never be attacked.

Then, eventually, the parasite gets introduced as well and the non-native plant species has de-evolved its natural defences. So while the infestation can be held in check in its native lands, the plants in the new habitat are completely wiped out - sometimes with a few survivors which haven&#39;t lost their resistance.
