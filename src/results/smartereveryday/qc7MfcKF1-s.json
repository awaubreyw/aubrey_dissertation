[{"comment_by": "Foxwood Astronomy", "comment_text": "This is Gordon the developer of Solar Eclipse Timer checking in with you.<br>- I want to thank everyone for the comments here as well as the great reviews on the app stores, I appreciate it! The comments that indicate an understanding of the difficulty in developing and delivering an app to the public are noted. It does require a passion for the subject and the project. The comments that discuss the fact that this video and my app have made you even more enthusiastic about this eclipse are special to me, those are gratifying and an inspiration. My goal is to make this eclipse successful for people! I want everyone to enjoy the partial phase phenomenon, have exact timing for photography and eye safety, look for shadow bands and look at the 360-degree horizon. That is what I designed my app to do, &quot;talk&quot; you through a solar eclipse!.<br>- Destin is a great guy and it was really fun doing this project with him. I appreciate the opportunity to make solar eclipse education, one of the Smarter Every Day series of videos. He is a very talented video editor, he made this a very educational video and told my story about developing a &quot;talking&quot; solar eclipse timer in an entertaining way. He works really hard on the Smarter Every Day videos, I saw the dedication first hand! I can&#39;t thank him enough!<br>- I also want to mention my programmer, Tony Boster, also from Alabama. We started this project last August. Every development idea I came up with, he made work. Destin has an international following, so in the past 48 hours, we had downloads in many foreign countries. Some Android phones that were running a foreign language as the primary language caused some crash issues. Tony figured them out and fixed the problems and we released 2 version updates for Android in 36 hours. He has worked hard to make sure we had a stable app for everyone around the world. If anyone needs a US based mobile device programmer for iOS and/or Android I highly recommend Tony. Contact him via <a href=\"http://www.orangewaveapps.com/\">www.orangewaveapps.com</a> The link is also located on the information screen of the app. <br>- Thanks, Gordon", "comment_date": "2017-06-14T02:45:47Z", "likes_count": 951}, {"comment_by": "yumi", "comment_text": "the shadow band is probably caused by moon&#39;s gravity", "comment_date": "2022-02-24T09:11:36Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Heather Ryan", "comment_text": "So I just watched this video, and the extended version on your other channel and it was so interesting.

The temperature drop is something I didn&#39;t even think of, but it was significant. Very significant. \r<br>As for the shadow bands, I&#39;m not sure if I saw this, but I noticed just a few seconds after the totality broke, the shadows through the leaves of all trees looked like crescents. All of them. Literally every shadow cast through every tree, it was this strange web of crescent shapes of sunlight. As if it wasn&#39;t casting the shadow of the tree and it&#39;s leaves at all, but was casting the image of the eclipse through the trees.", "comment_date": "2021-08-26T11:37:06Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Wall Brick", "comment_text": "I experinced shadow bend, man It looked so cool (it happened near my house :D) to bad it&#39;s that much rare :(", "comment_date": "2021-07-03T19:25:09Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "JACKYBOI", "comment_text": "I remember this and what we did was we made an  camera from an old shoe box", "comment_date": "2021-06-16T17:57:09Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Hudson Crawford", "comment_text": "You need to be more kind", "comment_date": "2021-05-12T11:27:18Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Hudson Crawford", "comment_text": "Your need to be more kind", "comment_date": "2021-05-12T11:26:28Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Mary Lagua", "comment_text": "\ud83c\udf1f\ud83c\udf1f\ud83c\udf1f\ud83c\udf1f\ud83c\udf1f", "comment_date": "2021-02-28T17:35:47Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Mary Lagua", "comment_text": "\ud83c\udf8a\ud83c\udf8a\ud83c\udf89\ud83c\udf89\u2764\ufe0f thanks Destin.\ud83d\ude03", "comment_date": "2021-02-12T02:51:03Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Mary Lagua", "comment_text": "Is he an Astronomer?<br><br>Destin, that\u2019s not a regular cell phone.\ud83d\ude02 absolutely, pretty fireworks \ud83d\udca5", "comment_date": "2021-01-23T17:25:06Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Anthony X", "comment_text": "Would an Eclipse have an Poisson Spot?", "comment_date": "2021-01-02T00:19:51Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Mary Lagua", "comment_text": "Beautiful fireworks \ud83d\udca5", "comment_date": "2020-12-22T14:30:14Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Freddy Fazbear", "comment_text": "Very helpful, thank you", "comment_date": "2020-12-16T07:56:14Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "bizzo", "comment_text": "I have the video you seek.

For &quot;yaw&quot; I was glad to have the compass app on my phone.<br><br>I also now know several things about the gear I have.<br><br>I need something like 2-3x longer focal length for the sun&#39;s path to transit/fill the frame of my camera (was using 140mm micro 4/3). The solar filter I got (metallized foil/film) causes some kind of reflection or glare or distortion that leads to some really distracting artifacts, and came with no protective case, and feels like it&#39;ll be damaged if I handle it any less than very gently. I&#39;m really disappointed about the solar filter I got, since the metallized glass ones from thousandoaksoptical are ~2/3 the price of what the photo store sold me. So I have an order in with thousandoaksoptical, but for my current lens, I might need to make another order for the longer focal length lens I&#39;ll probably be using day of the eclipse.<br><br>I used auto bracketing across 7 stops for my practice today with aperture priority so the camera picked ISO and shutter speed. For the sun to look good it looks like I&#39;ll need to adjust the exposure control to -2 or -3 stops, I&#39;ll practice more tomorrow with those as the center point of the bracketing. But of course it&#39;ll be a completely different light metering situation during totality, so it&#39;s good to have an idea how my camera might act or might need to be suggested to change its operation in that situation. With the camera automatically choosing ISO, it used the max ISO frequently which made for some grainy images, I&#39;ll need to either set the ISO static or set a max ISO for automatic selection.<br><br>If I hadn&#39;t practiced today and learned these things, and tried to accomplish all of them day of the eclipse, I might have spent the entire eclipse fussing with my camera while simultaneously missing the experience and getting no good photos or video.

Thanks so much for your effort on this (coming from a true science super freak!) and for sharing it!! <br>  I did have a two-part question I&#39;m hoping you can answer as well as a comment on how to possibly better your chances at capturing the mysterious shadow bands! <br>  My question is: (A) Will taking photos of the various phases of the eclipse with my phone&#39;s camera damage the lens and, (B) If not, could I effectively &amp; safely use it to indirectly observe the eclipse, itself, from beginning to end as my &quot;visual buffer,&quot; thereby voiding the necessity for awkward glasses since the camera lens and phone screen would both serve as filters to the harmful light sources (which is the whole purpose of the glasses)? <br>  My shadow bands comment is: By the description the Doctor gave, the bands sound like a wavelength of a particular light band. Ergo, if you measure the distance between each bend or &quot;wave&quot; in the snakes as he called them, you would be able to determine which kind of light is causing the shadows and could use the appropriate filter to then make the light visible to the naked eye instead of its &quot;shadow self.&quot; It&#39;s much like the heat waves you see above a really hot stretch of pavement, they look see through or invisible to the human eye, but put an infrared lens between you and the light to filter that specific wavelength of light and BOOM!

It surprises me that there is a phenomenon that I&#39;ve seen on solar eclipses but has NOT been covered in this video.

That&#39;s awesome. I would like to understand it better, maybe you can ask the &#39;eclipse guru&#39; again on this and make a video about it? :D It&#39;s not like fast moving snakes, just static half rings.

I believe you have a Miro, I know its sensor is 12 bit native and will dump footage at 10 and 12bpc but I believe it used to be a paid option - worth looking into, you might already have it. overall dynamic range doesn&#39;t matter as much, the difference between the object you&#39;re exposing for and the bg is probably less than two stops. the important thing is encoding those two stops with as many bits as possible, so in post you can really stretch those stops out to make the difference more perceptible in typical 8bpc web encodes. the issue with doing that with 8bpc source footage is you have maybe two bits encoding said exposure range, so when you try to stretch them out you get really bad banding. might be worth looking into, might not. but like you said it happens once in a lifetime and you might be the first to get proper footage of them. feel free to contact me if you want more info, ensuring 10bpc processing in post is a whole other set of gotchas", "comment_date": "2017-06-09T06:26:32Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Captain JuliAmerica", "comment_text": "Man, I am so glad you made this.

I knew a Mom that would not let her kids outside during an eclipse because of this misunderstanding. The danger comes from the fact that as the moon blocks more and more of the light of the sun it becomes less and less painful to look directly at the sun without protection. It is painful to look directly at the sun because of the intense light, but we feel nothing from the U.V. energy. If you look unprotected at even the last moments before C2 or just after C3 you will feel no pain because 98% of the intense light is being blocked, but you will be bombarding your eyes with damaging U.V.<br><br>The bottom line; there is no more danger to you eyes during an eclipse than any other sunny day, but most people don&#39;t stare at the sun for 5 minutes during a bright sunny day.<br><br>A <b>marginally</b> safe way to observe the sun and the eclipse, if you neglect to obtain a proper set of glasses, is from it&#39;s reflection on water in a black container. Water reflects less than 10% of the U.V. hitting it&#39;s surface and the black container (a plastic &quot;leftover container&quot; with the inside spray painted with black paint) will absorb most of the rest of it.

It&#39;s actually quite a complicated issue but I&#39;ll try to summarize some of the main problems: 1. providing medical information to consumers without context and outside of a patient-physician environment. Ask your family physician the next time you see them, or ANY physician for that matter, about their opinions surrounding 23andMe and you&#39;ll see what I mean. The general public has a very poor understanding of &quot;risk&quot; as a concept (it&#39;s sad but true) and when most people in the general public see a result saying their genetics have a risk for a disease, they&#39;ll interpret that as they will definitely get it. 2. many of their results are meaningless. A good fraction of the diseases they purport to show risk for are diseases that would have been diagnosed at birth or in early childhood. And the ones that present later in life that they test, many of them have risks modulated far more by lifestyle choices than genetics. 3. they sell your personal genetic information to pharmaceutical companies for profit. Their ulterior motive becomes even more obvious when you realize the founder is the ex-wife of a Google founder and younger sister of a top Google advertising executive. <br><br>I hope you&#39;ll reconsider having 23andMe as a sponsor in the future. There&#39;s a lot of better written articles out there documenting what I&#39;ve said here, if you have the time, do some googling and see for yourself.
