[{"comment_by": "SmarterEveryDay", "comment_text": "When I was a kid my Dad would take me with him when he would &quot;moonlight&quot; and measure parts for people using Coordinate Measuring Machines (CMMs).  I have one particular memory of him programming a CMM while I was looking at a book we got from the library of the drawings of Leonardo Da Vinci. I&#39;ve always thought he has a wonderful way of describing complex phenomena and try to mimic his teaching techniques as best I can. I&#39;m very proud of my Dad, and grateful to have been able to make this video with him. <br><br>I&#39;m also very impressed with the incredible work so many people did to make the James Webb Space Telescope happen. The amount of brute force brainpower that went into making it happen is INCREDIBLE.  I dream of a day when we all work together as humans to dare mighty things and work on them together.<br><br>Thanks for watching Smarter Every Day. It means a lot.<br><br>Here&#39;s the link to the fun JWST shirt if you&#39;re interested. I wanted a shirt that had the maximum amount of JWST talking points.  L2 Orbit path, sunshields, mirrors....  It&#39;s awesome. I commissioned an artist named Penny from the UK to design the graphic for the shirt and we&#39;re really happy with how it came out!

Like Dustin&#39;s dad when asked about measurements and calculating for 0g he said smarter people than him. admitting he is good at what he does but not smart enough to do that and giving credit to those that do. The the guy that calculates those measurements admits he would not be good at taking the precise measurements and gives credit to all of them there. I feel this type of thing is something society is greatly greatly lacking today. Everyone thinks they are the smartest person in the world due to the ego boosting of social media.

I at one time worked in the Energy Efficiency industry as a sales manager where we manufactured and sold radiant barrier (&quot;RB&quot;) for residential and commercial applications. Radiant barriers work in two ways. They both A) reflect thermal radiation, measured in a &#39;reflectivity&#39; scale from 0-100% and B) resist the transference of radiation through an object, referred to as emissivity, again measured from 0-100%. A RB that reflects 97% of thermal radiation only &quot;emits&quot; 3%.  Reflectivity and emissivity are inverses of one another.  For an object to be accurately called a radiant barrier (for marketing purposes) they must reflect at least 90% or more of the radiation (or emit less than 10% of the radiation) that the object absorbs.  Reflecting happens on the side of the RB that faces the sun.  The emissivity action happens on the side the RB that is not facing the sun.  A RB MUST, MUST, MUST have an air gap on one side of the film.  If you &#39;sandwhich&#39; the RB between two things you neutralize the efficacy of the RB as the thermal radiation will just &#39;conduct&#39; through the RB.  Thus, along those lines, a critical factor that will degrade the reflectivity/emissivity of the RB is whether or not you put a film one one side of the RB, say a silicone coating perhaps.  But, as long as the other side of the RB is clean and shiney and exposed by at least a 1&quot; air gap, the RB will function via its emissivity properties as opposed to &#39;reflecting&#39; - which I imagine is why they have the shiney side on the inside, away from the sun.  The silicone is probably there to help reduce photo-degeneration that will happen over time.", "comment_date": "2022-04-04T20:50:07Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "iSkulk", "comment_text": "This is so incredibly special.

Your dad and the gentlemen working with him remind me of the wisest and most inspiring people I worked with in mathematics and a long telecom career. They&#39;ve seen and know more in their field than anyone younger but can still talk about it with optimism and the possibilities of things to come. The things people like you and your friend bring forward.  Anyone they teach becomes a collaborator more comfortable to take on new knowledge where a know-it-all senior teacher would create just the opposite environment. They tell us what the shape tolerance requirements are sounding casual about things. When asked a &quot;what if&quot; question as any analytical person would do hearing + and - tolerance, they respond with something like &quot;well it better be right...&quot;. On any scale, Kilometer, meter, cm or thousands of an inch, we know they are hitting it dead center measuring, marking or punching. I doubt the work your dad retired from would have ever caused him to think he would be qualified and a real contributor to the most important space, time, physics, astronomy, signal-boosting wireless receiver, recorder and retransmitter ever built so far in mankind&#39;s history. <br><br>Your production teaching moments showed several times in this content but the best moment for me was you starting to explain how the video outtake with your friend the data cruncher was part of a longer timeline. How from the viewers vantage point, we had jumped ahead in time and you were directing as back to content already in progress. It wasn&#39;t clear whether your friend instantly got that final-cut editing context and you had already related the Webb&#39;s overall purpose (capturing the universe&#39;s oldest light) to his slightly sarcastic question about whether you were working with a time machine. Reminding him, your dad yourself and your viewers that a first of its kind time machine (let&#39;s call it turbo chilled telee) was truly at hand.  I don&#39;t know how you accumulated all the content to release it at such a relevant  time, both at the LaGrange point and on Earth&#39;s always waring surface but watching you sit with you father watching the telescope&#39;s T minus launch with the selfie photo you knew had to be taken from the rim of the shield fresh on our minds - PRICELESS. Your camera focused and unapologetically capturing verbal and non-verbal communication from your father as he watched something so important approaching the moment it would achieve it first orbit sustainable orbit. Watching as his six year graveyard shift contributions and so many other people&#39;s contributions handed off to the heavens, the operators and potentially future or potential Nobel prize discoverers.  <br><br>I don&#39;t know your dad obviously but the emotions around that launch, the opportunity, his contribution and Webb&#39;s possibilities seemed both freeing and overwhelming during that post-launch moment. A father who teaches the son and then gets taught while still being listened to and understood.  A son teaches his own kids in the style that worked so well for him (and me) creates content so kids can forever know and brag about a grandfather&#39;s accomplishments. Father and son who can be in each other&#39;s presence, potentially tearing up with no flinching, no embarrassment and likely no apologies (unless you edited one out). That is what I saw. I learned a bit more than I knew already about the Webb telescope today but the fact that I already knew it was in space cooling down allowed me to experience the amazing mentoring, respect and loving relationship you and your dad have over the long haul. Even if your dad doesn&#39;t spend too much energy remembering the you that didn&#39;t want to hear about sine functions on days he was teaching them - that speaks volumes.  <br><br>I&#39;m certain your dad knows it was impossible for any family member to get access and walk around the fifth and final heat shield. The deadline was arriving to take it out of Alabama forever. I was reminded of a time coming across a content channel where a guy was boarding a nuclear submarine over arctic ice flows carrying personal video equipment where top secret methods and operations would be harder to hide from someone with your mind and background. Your dad and people like me don&#39;t need to know how you got permission for any of these places but we thank you for what you teach us and for the trust you&#39;ve more than earned - whether inventorying cleaved moon rocks , diving below sea and surface level or watching something that literally was laid before you flying toward its home beyond the moon. Even Covid helped this video as I would have otherwise seen the contamination suit you and dad wore as something ruining an otherwise, one-of-a-kind selfie. Visitors to Covid 19 Earth know that selfie was perfect.

I would have never thought that the shade sails had precise angles on each section to expel the heat back out into space instead of affecting the actual telescope. When you think about how the brain of the person(s) that designed this piece of awesome space craft works, It also shows how amazing and complex our brains can work. It simply amazes me. I design my own cars, Yachts, fighter/priivate jets, And that amazes people how I visualize these and transfer that image to my computer so well, And I see it as being a talent that im glad I have, Then I see something like this and it just blows my mind! Thank you for sharing this and to the team that allowed you access, And your Dad for taking the time to explain everything in such a busy environment. Cant wait to see the amazing stuff this telescope teaches us about the creation of things and I really hope its able to verify that the exo-planets we have found do indeed have atmospheres and terrain like Earth and lakes and oceans that contain water that has the same molecular structure of 2 atoms hydrogen and 1 atom oxygen as we do. I say this with hope as I heard (not sure how true it is) that this telescope will be able to tell by using infrared to study the gases released for planets to see what the planets atmosphere is made up of and well as what the liquid contains i guess by the way water evaporates? Anyway, personally I do not think its possible that Earth is the only planet that contains everything it does that supports life in such a huge network of galaxies exactly like ours and the number of planets that orbit their stars similar to ours. Somewhere out there ill bet there are thousands if not millions of planets placed in the exact location as earth needed to support life that has allowed that planet be created with the same features and minerals to make it exactly like our planet. Depending on the evolution of the micro organisms and other living things the people might not look like us but similar and could be either further advanced or less advanced than what we have become. But I do believe one day intelligent life will be found on a planet very very much like our own. I just hope that finding comes in my lifetime. Id Love to know That we do have others out there that are very close to being just like us. To be able to study how they live and how they travel from place to place, If they have figured out other ways to do things or if they have similar worlds to our own with some kind of vehicles, and Some kind of aircraft whether it be what we cal UFOs or if they have just figured out something comparable to the Wright flyer.. This is something I think about everytime I stare at the sky and see things like Arcturus Twinkling with so many colors and so bright. Whats really out there? there has to be another Earth With intelligent beings. Its just not possible that there isnt. I think its a selfish thing to think that we were the only lucky planet to have been littered with the 6 main elements that make up the Human Being. There is just no way. I cant wait til we find another and find a way to study it much better and communicate with the place. Shoot if its possible at the time they can send me on some kind of starship to go and visit the planet and send info back..i know I would probably never be able to come back, But Id do it to be part of the discovery of other civilizations and to be the first one to experience such an amazing part of history!", "comment_date": "2022-03-07T09:08:38Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Raymond Webb", "comment_text": "I&#39;m sorry but this is the single most piece of useless equipment.

This established &quot;ground truth&quot; data that he had not seen.

Or is it a moot factor as the tension of the shield is only a measurement in determining it&#39;s form factor or shape? Is gravity a force relevant only to mass, the shield&#39;s mass being relatively small enough not to matter?

On October 2021 when i finally started to go to work physically after ~2 years, my dad, not at all a science enthusiast, when i got back home from work started asking me questions about space, weather, geography, natural phenomena and also the science behind it. In my 35 years this was the first time my dad asked me something of my interest and listened to my answers (based on my knowledge level) with enthusiasm and awe. <br>We do not celebrate christmas, as i am from a muslim family, but the christmas of 2021 was very very special to me. On chirstmas day, december 25th 2021, my dad sat with me and watched the live broadcast of the launch of james web space telescope. While watching that, i talked about hubble telescope, comparing to that how gruelling and time consuming and the costly this new jwst was. he also saw the last view of the jwst when it was released and floated away from sight.

Personally I thought it was was more about redundancy about blocking certain types of light waves. I thought perhaps the first layer was blocking 90% of visible light and then the second layer was blocking another 5% of the deeper penetrating light waves and so on. So then by the time you got to the 4th-5th layer there was no possible way that any form of light could penetrate past that point and you could truly have a light-less environment capable of achieving those freezing cold temperatures. But it was super cool to find out that all those layers are actually designed specifically around transferring the heat out kind of like a heat sync funnel. It finally explains the unique shape of the sunshield not being something aesthetic or simply to save on weight but purpose driven by design around the physics involved.

A lot of things he could never talk about (Cold War, Star Wars, etc.), and the few that he could, he shared with me as much as he knew how. One of the very last projects he worked on, was the venerable Delta II Rocket out in Pueblo, Colorado. I still, to this day, have never forgotten the feeling of awe of seeing a space craft up close, and experiencing the smell of a mechanical clean room, and the excitement it filled me with to see raw materials come together to a complex working machine that was going to space. That has been one of, if not the driving force that has led me down a path of engineering my whole life.<br>I&#39;m 40 now, my Dad long since passed, and watching this brought back a flood of memories from my childhood, and wishing I could go back and take those plant tours again as an adult, and see things with a mind of better understanding.

They have actually built a five layer <del>burrito</del> heat aiming system where they can control how the heat is directed out of the edges of it by reflecting it between the layers until it reaches the edge and radiates out into space. Did someone order the Run On Sentence Bell Grande? I&#39;m hungry. What was I saying? Oh. And the animations in this video helped me totally understand the whole point system. To whomever did those animations: bravo. What a fantastic video.
