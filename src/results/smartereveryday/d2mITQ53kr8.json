I currently fly commercial helicopters (Bell, Robinson, etc.)  However, I have to admit that having watched this video I can&#39;t find ANYWHERE in it where you actually explain what CCPM is!!!<br><br>For readers who are curious, when you apply cyclic forces away from a steady state (neutral) you reduce lift in 1/2 of the rotor disc, and increase lift in the other 1/2.  Depending on which way you were going (if not in a hover) and which way you moved the cyclic, that means that the aircraft will either lose overall lift or gain overall lift.  That means you need to increase collective pitch so that you won&#39;t go up or down... but rather have just the aircraft respond to the cyclic input.<br><br>In an RC heli with CCPM your transmitter tells the collective servo how to compensate for the cyclic stick being moved.  So in addition to doing what you want cyclic-wise it adds or subtracts collective pitch.<br><br>This is easy to see during the &quot;cyclic pitch test&quot; prior to flight.  An independent cyclic would only alter the blade pitch in one part of the 360\u00b0 arc.  A mixed pitch will alter the blade pitch regardless of where the blades are in the arc rotation to &quot;assist&quot; with the collective to &quot;make up&quot; for what the cyclic would rob.<br><br>E", "comment_date": "2018-12-23T20:59:46Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Brian Heckathorne", "comment_text": "Flying rc helis takes a lot of practice.

There is no commercial two-bladed under-slung system available that can fly upside down, to my knowledge, as\u00a0no &quot;negative pitch&quot; mechanism exists that will permit the rotor system to go into such pitch angles. Multi-blade articulated rotor systems are the same, for virtually 99.9% of all commercially flying helicopters. Yes, one or two of the &quot;Red Bull demonstrators&quot; are aerobatic, but have been specially constructed with\u00a0multi-blade articulated rotor systems for just that purpose. I&#39;ve even\u00a0seen an old black and white\u00a0demonstration\u00a0video taken many decades ago (1950&#39;s)\u00a0of a person doing low-level loops in a three-bladed fully articulated system...very dangerous.\u00a0 Some military\u00a0gunships (AH-64 comes to mind) are capable of some aerobatics\u00a0(not when fully armed due to weight), and\u00a0I can assure all readers that an upside-down\u00a0function is NOT included in their military flight training.
