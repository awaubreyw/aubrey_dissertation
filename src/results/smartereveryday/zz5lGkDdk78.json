I would like to touch base on a common mistake that seems to be going around like a virus or bug. It is the word ASSAULT RIFLE. First and foremost let me tell you a little bit about my self. I am a CLEET certified firearms instructor, a gunsmith, and a lot more.<br>So the word ASSAULT WEAPON that you and so many others use now and in the past will no doubt give fuel to the anti gun crowd and is also a very very wrong term to be using for a rifle. Let me explain. The term Assault Weapon was created by the media,\u00a0politicians, and those who hate, dislike, or do not understand the Second Amendment, and \u00a0firearms at all. We know from experience that politicians are never satisfied with a definition unless they can change it at will. It wasn&#39;t too many years ago that the definition of an assault weapon was one being capable of full auto and select fire. Fast forward a few years and they upgraded it to anything that could detach a magazine. Go a few more years and it would include a barrel shroud.<br>And yet further down the road and it was a semi auto rifle with a bullet button, and detachable magazine that holds more than 20 rounds.<br>Do you see what I am getting at. You are unintentionally putting fuel on the fire to give them the reason they will undoubtedly\u00a0\u00a0use to ban even more rifles by saying that everyone already refers to them as an assault weapon so they truly believe the lies we tell them.<br>I will be watching to see if you give me a response or not, on this matter. If you choose to change your view on your rifles and start using the term WEAPON SYSTEM. I will unequivocally subscribe to your channel. \u00a0", "comment_date": "2014-03-02T02:24:21Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "TheSyNxxSnO", "comment_text": "And now i am going to take a shower.

Here&#39;s something else that would be fun for the high-speed.  Drip honey into a container that behaves as a strong dielectric.  Something like a Tupperware bowl or 1-gallon Ziploc bag.  Ensure that you have a dry environment (low humidity) and you should soon see the thinner strings of honey (drip from at least 12&quot;) will swirl around in a very erratic pattern and stick itself to the container.
