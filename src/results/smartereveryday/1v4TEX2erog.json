However heat energy is not one of the forms of energy than can just convert back into potential energy unluss you really want it to. So I believe this heat energy is lost to the environment even tho it is released immediately. I believe the reason you get out more Kinetic energy when you release the slingshot immediately is because the heat in the rubber band softens it. This allows the person to increase the extention of the slingshot so that the force that pulls back is the same as the force he puts in. The extra distance it increases by results in more energy imput from his hand since the energy is directly proportional to the sqaure of the extension. If he lets it cool the rubber becomes less elastic and reduces the extension for the same force therefore less energy is added into the system.

You would assume that having more potential energy throughout the whole band would work the best, but that&#39;s not how it works at all. Let&#39;s imagine the rubber band at the molecular level. If you stretched out a rubber band and were able to let go of both ends simultaneously, all the elastic energy contracting the molecules together would result in a net force towards the middle of the band, which is where it would contract to. In a slingshot, this is the natural tendency,  but it&#39;s not a plain rubber band. There it a fixed point in this situation (the handle) which changes everything. Since the molecules at the fixed point can&#39;t move anywhere, they simply pull on the one&#39;s next to each other, which pull on the ones next to them, all the way down to the end, which are the only molecules able to move. Because of this linked relationship between the molecules, the acceleration of the end is almost entirely dependent on the contraction of the whole rest of the band, so it doesn&#39;t really matter how strongly the end can contract. This means that having a strong but bulky band the entire length is useless, and just adds extra weight for the whole rest of the band to accelerate once the end is done contracting. Having a tapered end means less useless weight and thus is much more efficient. Plus it probably reduces air resistance as a little bonus.<br><br><br>I know the whole band is actually contracting simultaneously as opposed to 1 molecule at a time, but the logic doesn&#39;t really change, it&#39;s just easier to explain it that way.<br><br><br>It&#39;s kinda like a whip: you can&#39;t get the end to go that fast unless you change the ratio of speed and mass in the initial momentum  of the big end of the whip.

It&#39;s because of entropy! <br><br>Most materials elongate as they warm and shorten as they cool, but rubber works the other way around. The elastic material is a bunch of long tangled molecules. When you pull the band to stretch it, you do work on the material. A perfectly Hookean material would retain that work via interatomic forces and changes in interatomic spacing. The rubber, though, also has these tangled molecules line up and become less jumbled. Thus, entropy drops. If entropy drops,  then the system needs to get rid of T*dS worth of heat. This is why the band warms when stretched. You want to have that heat available to help return to a shortened, tangled state. Otherwise, you need to rob some energy from the stored elastic energy, which then is not available for propelling the ball.<br><br>So, I don&#39;t think this is visco-elasticity.

The tapered bands are also more accurate, and its not just for the extra velocity. Take a tapered and non tapered set but match the velocity  by drawing the non-tapered harder, or the tapered not so hard. So they have equal velocity with equal projectiles you should also have equal joules of energy. But the tapered will still be more accurate. Is it just the aerodynamics?

Maybe you could help me understand your dilemma and then I could fully grasp the question.<br><br>Anyway the simple answer is from conservation of energy. If The rubber band cools off then it is loosing energy in the form of heat. So you need to account for kinetic,Potential and radiation(heat) energy. The sum of all the three will be conserved. Now If your rubber band cools down then automatically the Kinetic+Potential energy goes down then you have less Potential energy to convert to kinetic energy.<br><br>For your Second Question I believe other people have given a good answer (Alireza Tofangchi and Jagosh Bandnjarevic) However I feel that their answers are incomplete.<br>Just the mass alone should not be enough to cause such a huge change in acceleration. I would add air resistance (The tapered band will feel less resistance due to air), but that too wouldn&#39;t be enough.  Then I though about heat dissippiation, less surface area(tapered) means that the tapered ends will be heated less(More heat generation towards the broader ends) than the un-tapered  elastic bands ends(should be more or less uniform through out the material). I believe it can be a combination of all the three factors that make the difference(air resistance might not actually cause any visible change however coupled with the third effect it actually might do so).<br><br>However to fully ascertain what the is making all the difference.

The tapered elastic hold less energy yet releases more, therefore it has to be acting more efficiently.  If you were to look at the energy stored as a function of the distance from the yoke, the portion of the total energy stored in a given length of the elastic must decrease the further you move from the yoke and the spring constant per unit length  decreases in a similar fashion. I&#39;m willing to bet that if you were to put more frequent gradations along the length of the elastic, you would see that the rate of contraction of the elastic once released would correspond to it&#39;s position along the elastics length and the elastic would not contract uniformly like a non-tapered elastic. All of this would mean that the tapered elastic would be able to transfer it&#39;s strain energy into the projectile over a longer period of time giving it a more efficient release of energy.

Ans:  Once you hold the rubber band , since its  material partly behaves as viscoelastic , the stress in the band gradually drops, hence reduces Max force initially generated by stretching, which  finally causing a drop in kinetic energy of the ball.  That dissipated energy appears as heat. i.e   part of initial elastic energy dissipates as heat when you hesitate unless you release it immediately!<br><br>Why tapered band ( less material)  is more effective than  untapered ?  Ans:  it\u2019s a bit tricky.  Note that all elastic energy in the rubber releases  as kinetic energy in the ball PLUS kinetic energy in the rubber band.  Yes ! don\u2019t forget rubber band also obtains kinetic energy  because of its mass when it pushes the ball forward.  The more mass in the band, the less kinetic energy left for the ball !  Mathematically, a third of mass in the  rubber band comes into account.  Therefore, reducing the mass of rubber band ( by tapering) will increase the share of kinetic energy of the ball at the end. However, the tapered  may loose a bit elastic energy but ratio wise, because  the Hook&#39;s law is non linear for the rubber band, the net effect is in favor to increase  the ball kinetic energy .", "comment_date": "2016-03-20T00:43:07Z", "likes_count": 347}, {"comment_by": "Native Gaming", "comment_text": "Third question...

This is in fact not true. While surely some of the work done to stretch the band is stored as potential energy, most of it is immediately dissipated as heat. Heat is then absorbed from the surroundings as the band goes from a stretched state to an un-stretched state. The reason for this is pretty interesting, in my opinion. Rubber is made of polymers, or long chainlike molecules. When rubber is in the un-stretched state, you can imagine them tangled up like spaghetti, except Brownian motion causes all of the spaghetti strands to wiggle around each other. They have a bit of room to wiggle around, because rubber is an amorphous solid and has no lattice structure, but they can&#39;t just move anywhere; they&#39;re still constrained by the chemical interactions which maintain the material&#39;s shape. When you stretch the rubber band, you are pulling those spaghetti strands apart a little bit, but they never slide past each other like in a fluid. The chemical bonds holding the material together aren&#39;t strained very much until the rubber is stretched almost to the point of breaking. In a stretched stat, the Brownian motion of the polymers that make up the rubber is constrained much more tightly by chemical bonds. The number of microstates associated with the un-stretched system is greater than the number of microstates associated with the stretched system, because the Brownian motion of the molecules is constrained more and more as the rubber is stretches. This means that the entropy of the un-stretched state is higher. We see the rubber lose elasticity as it cools down because the polymers are moving less, which means that there are fewer microstates when it returns to the un-stretched stat, and there is therefore a smaller entropy difference between states. This is interesting because it means that the reason for the rubber band&#39;s contraction is not entirely because of the first law of thermodynamics (energy is conserved), but in fact is mostly due to the second law (entropy always increases).

The tapered band, on the other hand, should, because parts of the rubber are thinner than others, speed the ball up in a more continuous fashion. This should mean that the rubber band is staying behind the ball, pushing it more and imparting more momentum into the projectile. I liken this to a rifle barrel.

Assuming that you are inputting the same amount of energy into both the tapered and rectangular slingshot bands, the tapered slingshot would create less friction (and consequently less energy lost in the form of heat) because less material is present. Therefore, more of the energy inputted into the band can be converted into kinetic energy causing the tapered band to accelerate more than the rectangular band. Also, another idea is that the force applied on the frame is increased in the direction of the frame because there is less surface area attached to it.

So the gas cools.<br>Now, in order for the gas to expand again, you need to give it the same energy it had before it was compressed.<br>Deodorant - it is a gas in a can that is under pressure and at room temperature. When it was compressed into the can, it got hot, and then slowly cooled off. When you spray the deodorant, the gas absorbs any heat it can find in order to get enough energy to expand(that is why you can freeze your skin if you spray deodorant directly on it).<br>(or the can will blow up when you heat it as the gas expands inside the can increasing pressure)<br><br>On to rubber(finally)<br>Same principle(despite what you may think).<br>When you stretch rubber, the atoms in the rubber get closer to each other resulting in more bumping into each other - heat. When you release the rubber, the atoms/molecules absorb the heat again to return to their previous state.<br>And rubber is not gas! This is important because the sling shot happens faster than the rubber molecules can take heat from the air and regain their energy. While gas molecules just keep on spreading trough the air looking for heat, the rubber is left only with the heat(aka energy) in it&#39;s container - the band.<br><br>The tapered band question...well...I can take a shot at it:<br>When you stretch rubber, you give it energy. The energy(potential until it&#39;s released)<br>is distributed evenly throughout the rubber.<br>On a sling shot:<br>A straight rubber band is pulled to a length and energy is distributed evenly throughout the band. when you release, the energy is equally &#39;consumed&#39; by the whole rubber. And with some math you can calculate stuff :)<br>But a tapered band is narrower in one place. When you pull the end of the band, the tapered(narrow) part stretches first, because it requires less energy to do so. Then the cascade begins.<br>As you pull the band(imagine this) the tapered part get&#39;s(let&#39;s just say) hotter, and the rubber molecules in it start moving fast. Now as you keep pulling, the atoms in the tapered part start moving faster and faster, hitting the outer &#39;layers&#39; of rubber atoms and giving them energy.<br>So the &#39;source&#39; of energy distribution is the tapered part, and it&#39;s giving maximum energy output to surrounding rubber - thus maximum potential energy in the rubber closer to the tapered part.<br>While the straight band get&#39;s the force evenly distributed, and has &#39;medium&#39; energy the entire length of the band - the tapered band has &#39;maximum&#39; energy in one part then the rest of the band. But, that is more potential energy.<br>If you were to just keep pulling, eventually both bands would reach the same amount of potential energy, as the narrow part on the tapered band achieves it&#39;s maximum first.<br><br>Who understands this leave a like! hehe<br>Please correct me if I&#39;m wrong,<br><br>This is BoRHeZ, and you are getting smarter every day! ;)", "comment_date": "2013-12-29T15:14:18Z", "likes_count": 5}, {"comment_by": "Michele Schottenbauer", "comment_text": "Cool! \u00a0<br><br>Check out my science lab books in English and German, with free samples on my website!", "comment_date": "2013-12-26T16:07:47Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "John-Jozef Proczka", "comment_text": "Countryboy4life that does not explain what is happening here.\u00a0 For instance if you stretch steel when it is hot it will resist stretching less than when it is cool.", "comment_date": "2013-12-18T23:31:17Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "countryboy4life", "comment_text": "the answer to number 1 is that it looses potential energy when it cools because heat is a form of energy and stretching the rubber causes friction in the molecules.
