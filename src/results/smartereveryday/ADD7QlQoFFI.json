As result of this collapse of the tension stress, a compression wave starts moving along the spaghetto until the combination with the pre-existing compression status in the lower side due to the bending  causes a fragile rupture where the material is less resistant. This would cause a tension wave going back through the separated piece and overlapping the tension due to bending status and possibly causing a further rupture.", "comment_date": "2019-07-27T11:21:23Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "DropOnlyTv", "comment_text": "Actually u can see the same thing when u hold a measuring tape.

This is physically connected to the other weakest areas- or points where fracture is naturally determined most likely to occur- by pasta with greater integrity; which will immediately transmit the sudden energy change caused by the fracture, the shock of which is sufficient to overwhelm at at least one other of those weaker sites already near breaking point.

I hypothesized that if you broke the spaghetti noodle using one finger on each side that you will have a better chance at breaking it into 2 pieces instead of 3+ pieces.

Then you can see this like a compression status that overlaps the bending with a wawe starting from the breakage point that travels along the spaghetti at the &quot;sound speed&quot; that in a solid is incredibly higher than in air, this compression as said overlaps the existing status causing the existing tension to fall down and the compression to increase and eventually a fragile rupture in a point where the spaghetti is weaker.

Now, if we take the spaghetti and break it at the distant sides, will it still break into three? I think not, because as the spaghetti now has less mass to deal with, it does not have enough mass to have such a problem (by problem I am referring to the &quot;one side gets the message slower&quot; problem).

First you have to understand the characteristics of spaghetti. The outside has a much higher cohesion rate than the inside. There is a high rigidity overall as well. So as you bend both ends you compress the center. What happens next is that the center  fails before the outside does. So all that&#39;s left is a thin outer shell. If you can precisely alter the surface layer so that it is more flexible and the center breaks first it should break in only one place. At a microscopic level basically small cracks zip across the surface and since the surface was holding it together when it goes the rest of it goes. This is more a material physics problem as opposed to particle physics.  Too bad goyum don&#39;t get prizes for nobel physics The main aspect at play  is the ratio of  semi-homogeneous surface rigidity to internal rigidity.  These fractures are compression fractures. By altering the surface characteristics you can change how it breaks. put it in hot water and pull it out before it&#39;s fully cooked and it snaps in half", "comment_date": "2017-11-12T09:20:46Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Zariah Scott", "comment_text": "His daughter in the background in the beginning of the video now that was funny at how she was copying her father, I loved that", "comment_date": "2017-11-12T04:21:26Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "N.B.R", "comment_text": "Im inpressed that a man can even talk 7 minutes about a snapping Spaghetti", "comment_date": "2017-11-08T22:22:20Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Subhojit Dey", "comment_text": "Your kids are adorable.", "comment_date": "2017-11-08T17:30:37Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "VEGETADTX", "comment_text": "I LOVE this channel so much! :)", "comment_date": "2017-11-08T10:03:07Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Peter Wu", "comment_text": "Justin, its technical term is called Brittle Fracture.", "comment_date": "2017-11-06T18:46:46Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Qwertyjom", "comment_text": "A strand of dry spaghetti is very rigid that the vibration can break it into three or more pieces<br>Edit: at <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADD7QlQoFFI&amp;t=2m01s\">2:01</a> the vibration travelled through water", "comment_date": "2017-11-06T10:24:41Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Ray_3", "comment_text": "Mom spaghetti!!!", "comment_date": "2017-11-06T09:07:24Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "TheTechnoPro", "comment_text": "Awesome video, thank you for making my dinner so much more interesting!", "comment_date": "2017-11-05T21:15:48Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "TheCraftinFluffy", "comment_text": "The Most Brilliant of us humans, dedicating their lives to snapping spaghetti underwater.......", "comment_date": "2017-11-04T17:17:34Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Ender Songwriter", "comment_text": "The thing is if you take his phantom video projected and slow down that playback speed it shows the secret", "comment_date": "2017-11-03T23:27:25Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "nokia higurashi", "comment_text": "Why spaghetti breaks in to more than 2 pice <br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>BECAUSE SCIENCE", "comment_date": "2017-11-03T14:28:28Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Triston Herrera", "comment_text": "Your wife goes and gets you spaghetti noodles for a YouTube video because she knows that video will make money so you can buy her new shoes lol", "comment_date": "2017-11-03T07:20:36Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Sweg Freg", "comment_text": "Watching this and someone comes in and thinks ur actually smart lel", "comment_date": "2017-11-03T01:41:55Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Miguel Porciuncula", "comment_text": "Trisha i love you,d kita makalimutan miss na miss na kita, ikaw kasi yung babaeng nagbibigay ngiti sa labi ko,sana maging tayo ulit,i love you Trisha.

The description at this point suggests that the spaghetti is straightening out in a way that doesn&#39;t seem to imply a tighter bend at the second fracture position, the way I hear it. Actually, as I write this, I start to doubt the explanation. I&#39;m no physicist or engineer, but I wonder if, after the tension is released by the first fracture, the now freed pieces of spaghetti are accelerated rapidly by the forces at the fingers and thumbs, beyond the tensile strength of the free ends (already under strain), particularly on the longer side. I guess one way to test this would be to find by experimentation the angle at which pieces of spaghetti break on average, then bend a piece to that degree, hopefully just shy of breaking, then releasing one end suddenly from a standstill (like you might casually flick it from a fingernail, but with more control).

Explosion happens and there is a pressure and a light sensor, the light sensor being sensitive to small fast photon particles will know first of the event ,while the  pressure sensor has to wait until the slow sound waves reach it first so that it knows that the explosion happened. Same concept here but the Waves would be the different forces that travel through the spaghetti and since different EMF are absorbed and scattered and reflected and transmitted at different rates  and speeds based on the frequency of the wave, they will affect atoms and molecules and basically the different chucks of matter at different times.

I know almost nothing about physics, so sorry if this makes no sense, but I&#39;m kind of obsessed with this now and I have some questions.<br><br>So spaghetti breaks into 3 or more pieces because of cascading fractures, but why does this happen to spaghetti, and not other rod-shaped objects? Why do other things, like pencils, break in a different way, into only 2 pieces? What&#39;s the difference? Is it because spaghetti is made of a more flexible material than a pencil? Is it because spaghetti is thinner and longer than a pencil?<br><br>I&#39;m really bummed that I don&#39;t have any spaghetti right now, but I&#39;m breaking soba noodles instead. They&#39;re roughly the same size and shape as spaghetti, but a pretty different texture. I&#39;m breaking the whole noodles into pieces, then breaking those pieces into smaller pieces, and so on, until the pieces are too small to break. It seems almost 50/50 on whether they break into 2 pieces or 3, but here&#39;s something that&#39;s kind of freaking me out:<br><br>Now these are really rough because the noodles don&#39;t actually break perfectly in half BUT: A whole soba noodle breaks with cascading fractures often. A half noodle, even more often. A quarter noodle, less often. An eighth-of a noodle, never. Why does the half noodle have cascading fractures more often than the whole noodle? Is there some kind of sweet spot here? And what would happen if someone made an insanely long noodle that was still the same thickness as normal spaghetti, and broke that?<br><br>I want to get some actual spaghetti and other types of noodles and write down how often the cascading fractures are happening with each different length and type of noodle. I see so many potential patterns there but it&#39;s frustrating because, just snapping a few soba noodles, there seem to be a million variables at work. I think length of noodle, type of noodle (material), position of fingers on the noodle (closer or farther away from center), and the speed at which I break it all seem to make a difference.", "comment_date": "2015-12-11T03:56:28Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "0Accountability", "comment_text": "a video about breaking reddit users in half?", "comment_date": "2015-12-10T16:24:48Z", "likes_count": 8}, {"comment_by": "Apocalypse", "comment_text": "gravity falls YASS", "comment_date": "2015-12-09T02:12:22Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "tabatha w", "comment_text": "Jeese guys children in Africa could of eaten the pencil", "comment_date": "2015-12-08T22:51:43Z", "likes_count": 5}, {"comment_by": "Productive", "comment_text": "hmm Mom&#39;s Spaghetti", "comment_date": "2015-12-08T17:55:53Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Raisin Robsi", "comment_text": "I think to really test if it is the curvature of the spaghetti, you would need a mechanical device that holds each end of each\u00a0noodle and breaks it in the exact same way.

Fly fishermen know this phenomenon as mending, when they throw a loop out from the end of their pole to manipulate the position of line on the water. The loaded energy travels down the fly line, or hose, or spaghetti just behind the loop, or kink. In the case of the very fragile spaghetti, a fracture occurs at the top of the loop, at the point of maximum flex. But the energy travelling down the rod is behind the loop, remember. So when the break occurs, the end whips downward like a bow, making the short piece spin in the opposite direction of the loop curve. The energy travels in a straight line, so it forces the free end to move towards it, down from the loop. But it does seem that there are at least two types of energy in the spaghetti. There is the energy stored and released in the original flex, and there is also the shock wave travelling down the rod which has been released by the previous break. Before any break occurs, the energy is stored somewhat evenly along the length of the rod. A break focuses some of that energy, which then becomes a shock wave, but there is still energy left in the remaining bend. That is why the spaghetti goes through all those contortions.", "comment_date": "2015-01-01T16:31:48Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Scott Mayo", "comment_text": "I still don&#39;t get it; can someone explain?", "comment_date": "2015-01-01T16:31:40Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Tim Caban", "comment_text": "10/10 would watch confused fish again", "comment_date": "2015-01-01T15:21:01Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Prasanna Banwat", "comment_text": "Genius!\u00a0", "comment_date": "2015-01-01T13:37:56Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Make Science Fun", "comment_text": "Quality.", "comment_date": "2015-01-01T10:35:13Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Baggy Trousers", "comment_text": "Did that just break faster than glass fractures?", "comment_date": "2015-01-01T10:33:10Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "SShantanu Chawri", "comment_text": "Hello Justin, I enjoy your videos.<br><br> I was just curious to understand why to people yawn and stretch the they are sleepy?

You can see most of the future break planes in the cascading fracture video at 40,000 fps, before they break there. Perhaps those weaker planes are created by the bending and thus become natural break points.

I mean.. maybe in the &#39;slow-motion video of spaghetti\u2019 world, sure. What you failed to mention is why the mechanism of spaghetti differs from that of, say\u2026 steel for example. Assume you apply bending moments, due to downward forces like you did in the video, on both ends of the steel [beam] in equal and opposite magnitudes and directions, respectively. Undoubtedly, a steel beam--like spaghetti and every other material--will experience stresses (in this case, bending stresses), whereby the fracture plane should occur at the middle of its length and extreme fiber of its cross-section. But why doesn\u2019t the spaghetti behave in the same way?\u00a0<br><br>The simple answer is that spaghetti is not completely solid; it is a tube. When a tube is bent, the outer wall becomes thinner due to tension, while the inner wall becomes thicker due to compression; this explains why the outer wall of each piece breaks first. It breaks in a downward compressive manner, followed by the upward tensile direction of the other end. Additionally, as a result of bending, the tube exerts an internal pressure. The internal pressure causes what is known as \u2018hoop stress\u2019, which behaves differently for thin-walled vs. thick-walled tubes.\u00a0<br><br>To determine which case it is, we must first make some observational deductions from the geometry of the spaghetti. Since it \u2018appears\u2019 solid, it must mean that the radius-to-thickness ratio is less than 10, meaning it must be a thick-walled tube. Thick-walled tubes behave in such a way that the stresses vary significantly between the inner- and outer-walls, also explaining why the thinner (due to bending) outer-wall breaks first. Essentially, the bending stress in the spaghetti acts concurrently with hoop stress, thus accounting for \u2018premature\u2019 fracturing and thus the additional fracture planes.\u00a0<br><br>Physics is some cool shit.", "comment_date": "2014-12-29T04:07:13Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Adam Paul Dioguardi", "comment_text": "I know you have real engineering to do, but have you thought of publishing your results or partnering with people in the relevant field to do so?
