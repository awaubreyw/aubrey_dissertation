No I\u2019m pretty sure you know what\u2019s happening it\u2019s just presented a little bit off. These waves seeing on one of the flat boards making sand move shows you one slice of where the sound is pressing against itself. This can be done with as little as four speakers although it is better with more you could probably even do it with less but stability adds with more. As a sound moves through the air it makes these waves when the waves cross from the two different sources it\u2019s like having two hands pushing up at the same position that crisscross is where you find your stuff is holding. The information from the scope is literally useless to properly visualize it. If you were to have a set up that is just two speakers for example it would be like two fingers pressing straight up and down or like two cars colliding. It won\u2019t hold anything because it\u2019s just creating flat it is more likely to have stuff Darting off to the side. I feel like it\u2019s important to represent an experiment with the functions of it but I guess that\u2019s what the developers do. Another thing to note is that if you put a single sound wave towards something that can reflect the sound back you can create a similar affect with just one speaker. That kind of intuition and information Will blow your mind when you see it work. That\u2019s a song comes back from the angle it creates that to wave where are using a bowl. But then you still have the flat crested coming from below and what happens is sing still get knocked around a bit. But imagine if you have a speaker and then you have some con that separates the waves and then dish so that the waves are sent back towards a focal points that\u2019s literally behind the speaker. Then you could levitate stuff above the speaker which is why a lot of sensors have the better put it towards the dish and then the dish is aimed out words towards where you want to go that\u2019s how the long distance sound catcher technology works. You can reverse engineer this instead of receiving sound sound sound and then create a levitation ray. One that you project out into the world. Dogs might be upset that you though. I think doing it with one speaker is a lot more efficient takes a lot less calculations", "comment_date": "2021-06-16T19:18:10Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Michael White", "comment_text": "Is it possible to resonate the earth with high frequency waves so high in repricocity that the ionosphere could be charged irreversibly into a neutron star?

If you point the top loads of two tesla coils operating 180 degrees out of phase to each other, the points in space between two top loads where nodes are formed from two electric waves cancelling each other is where objects can be placed for electrical acoustic levitation. But you likely need to rectify AC or DC to Tesla&#39;s LC (Longitudinal Current) first so you can have electricity behaving like a sound wave. Fortunately its easy to produce longitudinal electricity with only capacitors and coils connected in certain way. For circuit diagram, google &quot;The L.M.D./T.E.M.Test - JLN Labs&quot; and for demonstration of Tesla&#39;s longitudinal electric waves, google &quot;Transverse &amp; Longitudinal Electric Waves and Tesla\u2019s Longitudinal Electricity&quot; by electrical engineer Eric Dollard. Longitudinal electricity has electric field and magnetic field flowing in same direction as you can see in this video &quot;Replication of Eric Dollard&#39;s Analog Computer&quot;.

I&#39;m not totally sure what this could be useful for. Just an interesting observation. Maybe it could be applied to water filtration? Adjusting the size of droplets or even manipulating the direction that they flow could maybe allow us to use a different filter design or material.

I may be repeating an urban legend.<br><br>When I was 18(back in 1999), I had just graduated high school. I was working with a man who was about 35-40 years old. He told me that an old &quot;tinkerer&quot; that lived near him when he was young(let&#39;s say 30 years prior so around 69-mid 70s) had a room full of electronics. Many radios, CB radios, and an assortment of different devices... This tinkerer had noticed sound vibrations having effects on various objects, and decided to turn on all of his devices at one time(i do not know what frequency or frequencies he may have been using). Supposedly many items in the room began to levitate. Something happened... I don&#39;t know if the radios themselves moved around, or if something got bumped, but evidently something happened, and everything fell all at once. Since then he had not been able to replicate the experiment. <br><br>My question is, has anyone ever experimented with sound waves on a large scale to levitate larger objects(i know there are propulsion and weapon theories), if so can we get a video about sound waves moving larger objects?", "comment_date": "2016-01-01T16:46:40Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Petrarclan Chann", "comment_text": "How is this not a perfect analogy for wave - particle duality.

Even if you personally believe the two are incompatible (which I do) \u2013 it&#39;s better that there are Christians in the pro-science camp in the public eye, as it discourages the extremist anti-science tendencies within their community. &lt;/2cents&gt;", "comment_date": "2015-04-30T00:22:48Z", "likes_count": 5}, {"comment_by": "Summer sun", "comment_text": "Around <a href=\"http://youtu.be/0K8zs-KSitc?t=5m30s\">5:30</a> when the green liquid explodes it kind of looks like the red and the yellow that make up the green split apart", "comment_date": "2015-04-30T00:22:38Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "philjafo2", "comment_text": "Very cool even better then the breaking spaghetti video.", "comment_date": "2015-04-30T00:22:23Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "skillzz", "comment_text": "Cool video", "comment_date": "2015-04-30T00:21:57Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "P Hab", "comment_text": "Very cool", "comment_date": "2015-04-30T00:21:24Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "MysterSnow", "comment_text": "it would be cool if you sprayed mist or harmless smoke into it; it would be interesting to see the waves and he oscillations", "comment_date": "2015-04-30T00:21:19Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "mrcain", "comment_text": "what caused the effect at <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0K8zs-KSitc&amp;t=4m35s\">4:35</a>? it looked secondary", "comment_date": "2015-04-30T00:21:10Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Pablo D", "comment_text": "I think there is a game in there somewhere...", "comment_date": "2015-04-30T00:20:23Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "*elAndres", "comment_text": "Would changing the phase of the two waveforms to have the levitated objects translate up or down work?
