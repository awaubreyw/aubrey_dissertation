First though, let&#39;s talk Ants.<br><br>Most ants have clavate antenna which are used for an ability called Tandem Running. They will head off in pairs with a follower tapping the abdomen of the leader ant. If the tapping stops, the lead ant assumes the follower is lost and will being to circle in ever expanding circles until they find them, and head off leading the tapping follower once again. The caterpillars don&#39;t seemingly have similar antennae, but as they are in constant contact with one another they are in fact using a similar touch communication that ceases when they get too far from one another, such as when the last one stops, and the one just ahead of them realizes and stops as well, sending the signal down the pack toward the head. <br><br>Caterpillars also lack the sophisticated eyes of most other insects because they are a larval form of the insect, mostly having simple Ocelli which cannot discern complex images, and are simply used to detect the presence or absence of light. Caterpillars also tend to have their heads pointed in a downward fashion, not straight ahead, as it allows for focusing on what they are feeding on below them. As such, the ocelli on those at the front of those packs of caterpillars you saw would have their Ocelli tilted forward and not picking up as much light as those caterpillars at the back of the pack, who would have them tilted upward more. The rear caterpillar likely freezes when it notices a significant change in light levels, which indicates the potential presence of a predator, in an attempt to blend in with their surroundings. This is a defensive process known as Mimesis (Insects that try to look like something else in their environment, such as like a twig, or leaf, or a shadow in this case) and possibly also Thanatosis (playing dead). When those in front notice the lack of contact/movement from those in back, the ones who can best sense if a predator is casting a shadow over them all, it&#39;s possible they stop in turn which would create that undulating motion we see generating from the rear. The rear ones wouldn&#39;t control direction, just simply control the &quot;brakes&quot; for the pack. Those on the bottom layer appeared lethargic compared to those on top (activity-wise, not speaking of lateral speed) which may be due to their consistently darkened Ocelli, meaning those at the very centre of the bottom layer may in fact be entirely still. As my instructor would likely be saying, this would be an interesting research paper for someone.<br><br>BTW, If you are interested in learning more about bugs and can make it out toward where you filmed your autorotation video, I can make introductions with my Entomology Professor Dr. Cameron Lait, who was called in to discern the origin of the Killer Wasp everyone was panicking (needlessly) for their lives over. He is building an impressive arthropod collection, and I know he is teaching his Apiculture course this summer, so if things go well with the restrictions I am sure he would love to show you and your son around his beehives sometime soon.

A small increase in depth can make a profound change in the speed of flow, but where the caterpillars move down to the bottom and slow down, the water has a relentless supply on the surface.  there is usually an even more dramatic increase in part due to a reduction in helical diversion of the top layers as the water level is high enough to clear some of the substrate which causes disturbances.<br>As for adding a third layer, with the caterpillar example it depends on how much helical flow there is, in other words, how you cycle them through the layers.<br>If you have a center layer that remains fixed it is in effect the same as two layers, if you have the top two layers cycle but not interchange with the bottom layer it is the same as a single layer, if you cycle all three together in alternating entry at the rearit will not be as fast as if you cycle them in with a preference for the top layer to maintain consistent layer distribution.", "comment_date": "2019-06-02T16:49:10Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Adriaan B", "comment_text": "Pretty sure they are mimicking a larger animal to avoid being eaten.

So here is my tought:<br>1) All lego has 36 points to travel.<br><br>2) Blue lonely lego travels 1 by 1 point.<br>     It will take 36 points to finish the line.<br>     It travelled 19 points (last photo took when army finished the line)<br><br>2) Level 1 army travels 1 by 1 point.<br>     Level 2 army travels 1 by 1 point in the level 2, but it travels above level 1 which travels 1 point too. So, level 2 travels 2 by 2 points in ground zero.<br><br>3) Blue lego in the army travels journey points:<br>     level 1-&gt;   2<br>     level 2-&gt;   4 (in this time, blue is right above black)+  4 (in this time, is above green) + 4 (above orange) + 4 (above white) + 1 (in the finish line)<br>      =  19 which is right the amount of points travelled by blue alone lego<br><br>4) How fast? (by 1 move)<br>     It depends. If blue army lego begans his journey on level 1 out of 2, it will take X points until he reachs level 2 and then, will travel 2X points.<br>     If blue army lego starts on level 1 out of 3, it will take X points until he reachs level 2 and then, will travel 2X points until he reaches level 3 which will travel 3X points. And so on.<br> BUT, he cannot forgot that he does not stay in up levels forever, so he will slow down when blue lego comes down each level, travelling so many point correlated to each level.<br><br>5) Confusing, or clear?<br><br>Cheers Dustin", "comment_date": "2018-01-11T11:36:19Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Ashley\u2019s Tea", "comment_text": "the for the this vid is caterpillar", "comment_date": "2018-01-07T15:29:52Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Juneao Alfred", "comment_text": "Intelligent caterpillar \ud83d\udc1b..", "comment_date": "2018-01-04T04:05:06Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Juneao Alfred", "comment_text": "Take it and imagine put it in your mouth.. \ud83d\ude25\ud83d\ude25\ud83d\ude25\ud83d\ude25\ud83d\ude28\ud83d\ude28\ud83d\ude28\ud83d\ude28\ud83d\ude31\ud83d\ude31\ud83d\ude31", "comment_date": "2018-01-04T04:01:15Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Rodrigo Rojas", "comment_text": "The best part was the LEGO race sound effects... the video was amazing btw", "comment_date": "2018-01-04T03:54:22Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Helios Chromatic", "comment_text": "am i really the only one who comments on the &quot;spider causes erections&quot; in the endcard?", "comment_date": "2018-01-04T01:45:54Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Trajan Danubius", "comment_text": "Those caterpillars move like a caterpillar track.", "comment_date": "2018-01-03T20:42:16Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "veizour", "comment_text": "LOL &quot;I don&#39;t owe you anything, so I?&quot;.

When they start moving they are  spending the same enrgy together so once their energy runs out   ,they need to stop to regain energy or recharge. maybe we just see as synchronized but they are just moving ,stopping regaining energy and starting again please correct me if im wrong !!

The time it took for the blue caterpillar in the group to reach the end was  about 3.7s. Using the relationship v =(d/t), it can be proven that the blue caterpillar in the group was moving at about 9.0mm/s, and that the lone blue caterpillar was moving at about 49mm/s. Using the relationship t =(d/v), I determined that the lone blue caterpillar would have reached the end mark after about 6.5s. So, if I wanted to calculate what percentage faster Time 1(3.7s) of the blue caterpillar in the group is compared to Time 2(6.5s) of the lone caterpillar, I would use the formula, (T1/T2) x100, which comes out to be 57%. The blue caterpillar in the group was moving 57% faster than the lone caterpillar.

I will try to avoid just writing formulas and also focus a bit on interpreting the results. (In case you are a nerd I also have the formulas for you and approximations, that are all accurate up to o(1)).<br><br>We will be assuming the following:<br>1. All caterpillars are constantly moving in their own layer with 1 caterpillarspeed<br>2. If a caterpillar reaches the front edge of the heap it falls down in 0 time and a carterpillar from the back gets up simultaneously in 0 time as well. (=&gt; The number of caterpillars in one layer is constant)<br>3. There are n caterpillars in the ground layer (=layer number 0)<br>4. In layer number i over the ground there are exactly n-i caterpillars.<br><br>Here are some of my results:<br>The speed of a heap with k additional layers over the ground layer is (-k^2+3kn-5k+6n)/(3(2n-k)) caterpillarspeeds. Plugging in k=1, n=4, as in the lego model from the video, we get 10/7=1.4...<br>This is always less than (2+k)/2 but approaches this value for big n.(Except for k=0, where its value will always be 1. This of course makes sense, because there is only a ground layer travelling with the normal speed). This means, that assuming you have a very big number of caterpillars, the speed of the heap will increase by 1/2 caterpillarspeed for every added layer.<br>Also if you have n-1 additional layers (means the caterpillars are stacked up perfectly in a triangle) the speed will be approximately 2/3(n-1). This leads to the result that m caterpillars (in total, not just in the bottom row) can go as fast as ~2m-10sqrt(2m)/3+5. This means that the speed of the heap actually grows faster than the heap!

At the end, there is a 17 stud difference between the two racers, however because of the advantage that the lego train had, we need to subtract 8 from this number in order to get the actual amount that the single lego lost by. Subtract the two numbers from each other, and we come out to 9 studs being the actual number that the single brick lost by. The entire track is 36 studs long, from the start of the singular brick to the finish line. This means that for every 36 studs traveled, the lego train travels 9 studs faster than the single brick. 9 is one-fourth of 36, so the train is 1/4th of the way farther than the singular brick , therefore the train of legos is 1 and 1/4th times faster than than the singular lego.<br>Disagree with my math?

However, I also believe this is done to conserve energy. When ducks migrate, they fly in a V formation to cut down on wind resistance. Essentially dispelling the drag and conserving energy. As for the increase in speed, this is something we humans already do with conveyor belt sidewalks at major airports. We can move at greater speeds when walking on a moving platform than when we walk alone. The caterpillar in the back controls the collective because it is essentially the last caterpillar that has not only born the most weight (it is the one on the bottom) but has also expelled the most amount of energy and still moved the slowest.

You&#39;ll see several times where an individual caterpillar stops but the group keeps moving. The quorum might not be very large though, perhaps if three caterpillars stop at the same time.

But the biggest compliment is that you endeavour to inculcate the same habit in your kids. You seem like an awesome dad. High five to you from my side.
