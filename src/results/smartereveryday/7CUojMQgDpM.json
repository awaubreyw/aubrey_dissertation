You have traction when you operate in or near the static friction regime. If your shoe&#39;s slip velocity is above a certain speed, all traction is lost.  This is partially due to your shoe sole climbing a water wedge and being fully lubricated as a result.  But is starts with the difference between static and dynamic friction - that differential is huge for ice.<br><br>As the stones spin, one side has a higher slip velocity.  This while the other side has a low or zero slip velocity (when equal to the forward speed of the stone).  The side with the lower slip velocity grips more, and the stone curves towards that side.<br><br>There is a related effect that limits the forward speed of a conventional helicopter.   Half the blade disc has increased lift due to forward motion of the helicopter; and the other reduced lift.   This  lift differential is balanced out in practice, by using differential blade pitch; achieved via the swash plate.  But, when the blade pitch on the trailing edge of the blade is too steep, it reaches its limit for lift to drag ratio.  This occurs at the maximum forward speed of the helicopter, at a given carrying load.  The Osprey avoids this by turning the lifting rotors into forward propellers for much faster cruising flight, than it could achieve in &quot;helicopter mode&quot;.", "comment_date": "2022-02-28T07:55:05Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Hanna Madbak", "comment_text": "I have a little more respect for the curling olympic teams after watching this :).

Here is my theory to add to the research of the two others:<br><br>So we know that the leading edge of the curling stone hits freshly brushed pebbles of ice, as pristine as possible. The brushing of the ice in addition to the compression of the stone itself melts a tiny amount of ice into water, similar to an ice skate blade, which immediately refreezes after the leading edge has passed. The refrozen water will now have filled some scratches and valleys in between the pebbles.<br><br>The pebbles are also quite possible measurably more flattened (read: shorter) by the time the trailing edge arrives, although you might need a laser to measure the tiny difference.<br><br>The result? There is significantly more surface area on the trailing edge. Also, the trailing edge has no immediate benefit from brushing, so again, more friction than the leading edge.<br><br>More friction than the leading edge makes the stone curl in the trailing edge direction.<br><br><br><br><br>One more thing, the side edges of the stone should not be ignored.

Two results possibles :<br>- Nothing changes with a decreased height. So it is not that parameter which acts and probably no more the fact that the forward parts has more weigth when the speeds decreases.<br>- On the contrary, if the curl lowers or even inverts, that supports the theory of the importance of that load factor. It would probably mean that the more weigthed is a part, the less it brakes (surprising but to be verified).<br>I suggest this, because in theories explained, no experiment is shown, which seems to me a fundamental basis for a reflexion on this question !

Also the temperature difference caused by pressure (almost none) and the friction of the stone are to low to cause much melting. The friction melting theory does not look good to me.<br>But how about this - may friction itself be dependent on the velocity? There is static vs kinematic friction but I do not see part of the stone actually stopping on the rotation back? Because if the friction would not be constant with the velocity you can argue that there are different velocities on the inner and outer side of the stone (inner = rotating back, lower velocity with respect to the surface).

Like an ideal gyroscope or top, it tends to maintain its axis of rotation at some small angle from the vertical (ignoring precession and nutation, since the mass of the stone is large relative to its motion). Since the rotational axis of the stone is away from the vertical, friction against the ice is greater on one side of the stone, at a fixed angle when looking downward at the stone. This increased friction would obviously curve the path of the stone away from a straight line, like a stone that has more mass on one lateral side than the other.<br><br>Now, all that remains is working out the math to prove this.

Fluid friction is proportional to the square of the speed. If the rock is spinning counter-clockwise then the right side (top view ) has more friction than the left side. This causes the rock to want to expand but tensile forces in the rock keep it to together and this exerts a leftward force on the center of mass.

The side edge which is rotating forwards has to smash through a lot of untouched ice flowing against it, the side where it\u2019s rotating backwards is simply encouraged in its spin. It seems to me that the side of the stone moving forwards would produce more drag on that side of the stone because it\u2019s spinning against the ice, whereas the reverse-spin side is accelerated by the ice moving in the direction of its rotation. Maybe it moves towards the direction of least resistance. At first thought it seems like it would behave like a tank turning, it moves towards the slower tread(side moving forwards) But maybe since it is spinning, it doesn\u2019t have a stationary \u201ctread\u201d to slow towards, it becomes more difficult for it to move TOWARDS the rough ice on the forwards rotating side, it doesn\u2019t want to break against that ice and it\u2019s pushed away from it and it becomes easier for it to delve into the side moving with the ice. Kind of like climb-milling in a CNC vs conventional milling. Assuming the stone is sitting perfectly level and balanced, aside from extremely small unavoidable influences of stone imperfections, The front and back of the stone should equalize each other\u2019s sideways forces and not influence it much, one is pushing left, one is pushing right, as far as the leading and trailing edges are concerned, it is just spinning in place in equilibrium. Granted, the leading/front edge does have to deal with rougher ice than the trailing edge of the stone at any given time of motion \ud83e\udd14 I think it\u2019s just easier for it to be pulled into the ice which is moving the same direction", "comment_date": "2020-06-29T10:56:35Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Marco", "comment_text": "Explain to me why I would never watch curling \ud83e\udd4c on tv, yet this video fascinated me.", "comment_date": "2020-06-29T09:54:01Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Thundawich", "comment_text": "So which way does the glass bend on the ice?", "comment_date": "2020-06-29T08:16:47Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Mohammad Bin Mahbub", "comment_text": "did that last bit just create free motion?", "comment_date": "2020-06-29T02:35:41Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "mark broad", "comment_text": "The spin puts a slight bit more weight pushing down on one side, pushing it to the light side.

The rotating rock is creating friction and thus heat melting the ice and creating a lubricant. One side is creating more friction relative to the ice because of rotational speed. Therefore the one side is creating more lubrication with the melted ice while the other gets a little more friction and drag causing the whole rock to veer. Same issue with helicopter blades generating lift at high forward speeds.<br><br>A controlled experiment for this is to increase the rotation speeds of the rock and view the results. You&#39;ll probably notice a point where a faster rotating rock goes almost as straight as an unrotating rock.

Our bodies age and decompose, while we live to enjoy that hideous process....and when we do die we have no sense, literally,of whether a second has passed or a trillion years...We measure time by the objects that pass&quot;through&quot; it...bodies, planets, hands on clocks etc.....we notice how these measurements correspond to given natural patterns...planetary rotations and seasons...countless things.....BUT...time ITSELF....isolated from any physical or spatial corelates....seems without any boundaries...like we are living simultaneously in the age of the dinosaurs....We refer to time as &quot;passing&quot;...but what is it that has actually &quot;passed.?&quot;  We change...things about us...the cosmos....changes...but what is it about time ITSELF...that can be said to change. or even more confusing ...to MOVE...what exactly is moving? This is why it&#39;s pegged to physical characteristics that alter...things that indeed can be measured....as functions of &#39;something we call &quot;time.&quot;<br><br>Light has quantifiable properties....other properties invisible to our senses can be measured....gravity....other frequencies etc...These &quot;invisible&quot;properties  are measured in terms of effect....as with time....but then, with time, effect is an ill chosen term...because there is no direct quantifiable relationship from picosecond to picosecond.....in how the referenced body may respond....at least...to my limited knowledge......to specified tabulature for time as an isolated variable.<br><br>the question,I&#39;m trying to frame it...is...define the nature of time.

So one side slides easier and the slower side which  brakes or drags more hence causing the the curve factor. This relative to forward speed  and speed of rotation as varying these will  cause bigger arc curves and  change the degree too which it will preferr to move from the  straight motion. Hence  small arc can have small move left or right or small arc and bigger curve left or right. The faster the forward throw the curler will have a bigger arc and the degree it curves left or right depends on the rotation speed cw or anti-cw,  simple science to striaght from a rext book not yet written. As cuve left or right depends on time contacting with ice,slow launch more time and fast launch lesser time therefore a faster rotation give a increase in amount it curves over time.

For a while now we have seen how traction control and ABS (antilock braking system) works on cars. The principle is that you increase friction between the two surfaces, ie. Road and tires, by reducing the resistance or the opposing force if you will, between the two. Since there is a fine line between maximum grip and none at all, and this applies especially to ice. So when driving on snow or ice, applying more power ultimately reduces friction due to the surface melting. So the onboard computer now has to allow the wheels to spin slightly while braking to stay at maximum friction with as little surface melting as possible or optimally none at all. The opposite is also true when trying to move on ice or snow. The conputer will send much less power to the driving wheels to prevent spinning and stay within the grip provided by the elasticity and usable surface area of the rubber. This leads me to believe then, that the retreating side is spinning slow enough to grip the ice, while the advancing side is moving too fast to be affected by friction, so the rock will lose velocity on the retreating side and curl in that direction. Think of it as the inside having abs, and the outside skidding because the wheels locked up. I hope that makes sense, and I also believe that ice is a key factor. The rock would not behave the same on glass, water, wood or any other surface. I&#39;ve only ever seen this form of traction on ice (yes that includes snow).", "comment_date": "2018-07-07T06:48:03Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Samwich417 Uselton", "comment_text": "I get the impression that Destin is super scary when he gets angry", "comment_date": "2018-06-22T23:58:11Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Andrej Ivanovic", "comment_text": "Just heard five nights at freddy&#39;s  in background <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7CUojMQgDpM&amp;t=2m39s\">2:39</a>", "comment_date": "2018-06-21T09:20:31Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Ectotide", "comment_text": "<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7CUojMQgDpM&amp;t=2m46s\">2:46</a> :    Way Too Much Information", "comment_date": "2018-06-18T18:25:26Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Steve Davis", "comment_text": "Throwing rocks at  a house seems like a great idea to me , especially if A cheat is found \ud83d\ude01", "comment_date": "2018-06-14T08:59:04Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Viktor Schwarz", "comment_text": "<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7CUojMQgDpM&amp;t=3m09s\">3:09</a> Dark blue friction force vectors at the bottom of the glass should be pointing in opposite directions because friction forces always act against the direction of movement.

With the glass, as it is decelerating, the front area of contact has more drag, which combined with the rapid spin of the glass pushes it in the opposite direction of the spin. But a curling stone has much greater mass, which alows gyroscopic force to take a much bigger role. The stone wants to tip forward during deceleration, but gyroscopically the force is applied 90 degrees &quot;downspin&quot;. This causes greater drag on that side of the stone, which in turn causes the stone to curl in that direction. I expect that the balance between  the pure-spin drag and the gyroscopic drag is very sensitive to the coefficient of friction of the ice, hence the pebbling to maximize the effect.

One question though, why doesn\u2019t anyone mention the phenomenon of regulation? This is where ice meals simply due to there being pressure exerted on it. As a student I remember seeing a block of ice with a length of copper wire across the top and two heavy masses hung from either end of the wire. Over time the wire cut its way through the ice - the explanation being that regulation was melting a thin slice of the ice which allowed the wire to drop which in turn started to melt the fresh ice that the wire was now in contact with. In addition, due to the latent heat capacity of the ice, the small amount of frozen water above the wire then refrozen. This phenomenon, regulation, is also why ice skating works so well - the weight of the skaters presses on the ice and slightly melts a thin layer. So, surely regulation plays a part in the movement of something as large as these stones which I think are around 32lb.?", "comment_date": "2018-02-11T14:52:46Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Saxie81", "comment_text": "Who is watching this for this year&#39;s Olympics lol", "comment_date": "2018-02-11T13:18:15Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "carl", "comment_text": "i would rather watch paint drying as an olympic sport than curling..", "comment_date": "2018-02-11T03:27:22Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "makai_02", "comment_text": "I am soooooo lost! : p", "comment_date": "2018-02-10T17:20:23Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "lZEOBA", "comment_text": "At the risk of sounding arrogant (or possibly dumb), I&#39;d like to submit my theory..  I believe they have both missed the mark,.. it is all about momentum, (and a little friction) especially momentum on ice. Much like a vehicle taking a curve on ice where the rear and outside curve momentum of the vehicle pushes past the front and inside curve of the vehicle causing a spin in the direction of the curve (if it is a leftward curve it will be a counterclockwise spin), also while entering this leading edge of the vehicle encounters more friction than the following edge of the vehicle, which then causes this tipping effect (forward edge meeting more friction causing a gripping downward momentum thus causing a shift of weight lifting the rear edge of the object thus reducing the rear outward friction further. Likewise the spin of the curling stone when pushed is causing a greater momentum on the outer spin side of the stone. That higher momentum, for example on a clockwise spinning stone the higher momentum being from the 8 o&#39;clock to the 12 o&#39;clock positions, and the lesser momentum being from around the 3 o&#39;clock to 5 o&#39;clock positions and the areas in between being more or less neutral, &quot;curls&quot; the stone in that direction. So picture a momentum arrow going form the 8 o&#39;clock to 12 o&#39;clock position and the momentum of the weight of the stone will carry or push the stone in that direction, to the right. The spin generated at the stone&#39;s release will also generate a slight &quot;tipping&quot; motion from that momentum causing the stone to tilt toward its inner lower momentum side causing an increase in friction on that side while lifting and reducing friction on the outer higher momentum side therefore increasing the momentum and direction of the &quot;curl&quot; further in the direction of momentum.  The outcome is much different with the experiment of a glass on wood surface due to the much higher effects of friction on surfaces other than ice.", "comment_date": "2018-02-10T17:13:11Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Robbie Denton", "comment_text": "You are awesome but you like an adult with a actual baby&#39;s head.

But due to friction and heavy weight the rare side of the base ring is making the surface smooth..trapping the air inside the ring. This is more enhanced by some of the ice half cut drops melting due to friction. And that melted water jams the rare end of the ring trap the air inside the ring. Now the air has to escape somehow..and hence that leads to our observation. <br>On the other hand when some one is swiping in the front the half cut bums become smooth..less air is trapped inside the base ring and hence less air tries to escapes outside..and hence it tends to go straight.", "comment_date": "2018-01-07T07:12:52Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "David Phipps", "comment_text": "<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7CUojMQgDpM&amp;t=2m58s\">2:58</a>  Ok, you understand why it curl opposite with a cup ... because there is so much friction on leading edge, all the weight of the cup is on it as it&#39;s braking so hard.  If you spin that cup on ice with fewer revs/second and you&#39;ll see a different outcome... In regards to a curling stone, just think about it, the right side of a stone spinning clockwise is rotating back while the left side is rotating forward. So clearly there is more  grabbing on the right side of the stone, ie more friction. Just like you drive the right side of your car and its wheels into heavy snow, the car will grab it more than just normal pavement on the left and turn the car right.

The faster moving side melts more ice, causing less friction. So the stone turns toward the slower moving side. Test this with your glass now. Not on the coffee table, because the coffee table does not melt as you slide the glass across it. Duh! You need to do it on the ice, Einstein. My predictin is that it will curl the exact way the stone does. But in case it is too small, and the friction created by the thin rim of a glass is not enough to produce a noticable effect, use something bigger, like a soup pot, for example. Notice that the stone also has a hollowed out center, so there will be a friction free area between right and left to cause a more obvious effect. Same with a glass or a pot. But when you sweep in front of the stone, you create lubrication where you are sweeping. Sweep left, turn right, and the other way around. Sweep directly across and the full width of the stone, then you lubricate the whole stone, so the direction of spin is no longer important, and the stone goes straight and also farther. No mysteries. But the true beauty of curling is that the winners have to buy the beer, not the loosers.

I&#39;m also Canadian, so maybe that&#39;s just how we think. The scratch theory that the Swedish man talked about is what we used for so-called Directional Sweeping. If a sweeper starts their broom in front of the centre of the rock and sweeps on a slight angle towards the other side of the rock, they will create scratches on the ice like the Swedish experiment with the sandpaper. This will cause the rock to tend towards that direction. Before 2010, sweeping was mainly to make the rock go further, and also to make it curl less. Now, when I say curl less, there&#39;s an important distinction to be made. The rock is not actually curling less. If you throw two rocks 100% exactly the same, one swept and one not, the two rocks will line up perfectly, just one past the other. The rock doesn&#39;t curl less, but more it delays its &quot;breaking point&quot; when it really starts to curl, due to it not losing as much speed because of the sweeping. Before the 2010 Vancouver Olympics, we in Canada did a study on sweeping and figured out all this stuff about directional sweeping, but it wasn&#39;t really used. In 2013 and 2014, we had what would later be called the &quot;Broom-ha-ha.&quot; Horsehair brooms, as can be seen at <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7CUojMQgDpM&amp;t=4m22s\">4:22</a> with the guy on the right in the video, are extremely efficient at this directional sweeping, because the individual hairs scratch the ice a ton, and therefore make the rock move a ton. An interesting video on it can be found here: <a href=\"https://youtu.be/haEuz42YCdM\">https://youtu.be/haEuz42YCdM</a> The scratches in the ice make the rock tend towards a direction, but I don&#39;t think the rock causes the scratches enough to make it curl.

When something spins and at the same time moves relative something else the relative movement is through the spin decreased on one side and increased on the other side. For example if something moves forward and spins clockwise, the movements add on the left side and are substracted from each other on the right side. If the glas was in this situation, the friction would be bigger on the left side, which is why it goes left although it spins right.

It&#39;s not like darts of bowling in that sense - the goal is for at the end of the &#39;end&#39;, if you have last rock, to have at least two of your rocks closer to the button than all of the other team&#39;s rocks, and if you don&#39;t have the hammer, to either force the other team to only score one point (giving you the hammer for the next end) or &#39;steal&#39; by actually scoring points when your team doesn&#39;t have last rock. It&#39;s not like every player is trying to get their rock closer to the button, not at all actually.

But this isn&#39;t the case because time is irrelevant but just a factor of our daily lives making it relevant to us as humans. Curling is the same, no one really knows the physics behind how something so simple can be really difficult to understand. The bottom is perfectly smooth and the ice is sheeted by ionized water that have the tops trimmed off, but we still don&#39;t understand how the curl can move in the direction of the rotation.

And this is why. I&#39;ve got a little over three years flying the Alaska Bush at different times in my life. The first I was there the 1984 -85. One of the villages that I flew into to. Could only be done in the  the winter, because the village had no runway and was split by a narrow river. So after the river froze sufficiently thick. They would set up cones and put up a Winsock. Now the first time I went there I was told that if you wanted to make a right turn you hit the left  brake. So that&#39;s what I did. To my amazement it worked very well. It just really hard to push the right rudder pedal all the way to the stops. To turn the rudder the correct way. But then use the left brake and not the right. Which goes totally against your training. The reason it works that way was because the rolling tire created more friction and therefore made more drag on the right side. While the left tire being stopped actually created less drag.  Because the ice was melting under it reducing the friction.Which then help the nose wheel steering to the right.<br>And when you got really good you can lock up both tires and drift.

The reason your glass won&#39;t on the table is because the friction of the table and glass together is way to much for how heavy the glass is. It&#39;s simple math that I learned in 10th grade. Think about a tire on a car the top of the tire is moving faster (relative to the ground/earth) than the bottom so it&#39;s centrifugal force is different on top than bottom, if you could stand on that tire as it was rolling around and moving in a set direction you would not only speed up and slow down as you went around you would also be getting lighter and heavier as the speed changes the centrifugal force.

In our physics laboratory, we take large, heavy rectangular blocks and drag them across tables attached to spring cables. No matter on which face we put the blocks (large side, medium side, small side), the force of friction on the spring scale is the same. I confirmed this with laboratory manager. The only difference is that more pressure is on the small side, wearing it out sooner.

Sweeping doesn&#39;t just reduce the curl but makes it go straighter, as was said (why would that be the case with the scratch theory?). Also spinning the stone too fast (say one revolution every 3m) causes it to go straight and long. Points of low friction won&#39;t have anything to do with the curl, it is the points of high friction (and low velocity) that &quot;grab&quot; the stone and cause it to pivot. I think that specifically the water &quot;transport theory&quot; makes the most sense, and the magic spot would be between the receding side and the trailing side, where there is high friction plus a transverse force.
