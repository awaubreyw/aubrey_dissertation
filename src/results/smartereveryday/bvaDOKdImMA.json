I promise to get to the reason I&#39;m here today, so if you like, feel free to skip to the end. I&#39;ve held a fascination with fire since childhood. My maternal grandfather often took me camping and he&#39;d make a wonderful breakfast over a campfire with little more than a cast iron skillet and an old Wearever drip coffee maker. <br>Along with an assortment of kids from the neighborhood we tested the limits (and prudence) of the combination of wooden kitchen matches and &quot;stuff that might burn&quot;. We learned that matches of the phosphorus tipped variety produced a very satisfying report when fired from an air rifle onto the face of the cement steps outside my childhood home. That turned out to be a short-lived practice that had mom wondering about the noise, where were all of the kitchen matches and ultimately to a stern cease and desist order. At some point, a friend and I decided that it&#39;d be a great idea to practice our formidable skills as pioneers and cook fresh game over an open fire. Conveniently, we lived near a stand of pine trees where we often held the 1970&#39;s version of paintball. (My buddy still has a war wound consisting of a bb lodged under the skin of his thigh. Good times.) After much discussion about how roasted bluejay might taste, we opted for an alternate plan. We procured a handful of kitchen matches and several slices of bread from our house and then headed over to my buddies and found an open package of weiners in the back of his refrigerator. I expressed some concern about eating multicolored weiners, but my buddy said that we just needed to cook them a little longer and they&#39;d taste fine. Without going into the sordid details, suffice to say that we gleaned several key pieces of useful information from our experience. A fire made of pine branches produces a substantially less than palatable meal, particularly when paired with weiners that start off as greenish-gray. Pine straw is a great fire starter, but controlling the spread of fire in a pine thicket is exceedingly difficult when the only source of fire suppression is limited to the contents of the bladders of 2 ten year old boys. As it turns out, a fire truck with flashing lights isn&#39;t nearly as much fun when you&#39;re the reason it showed up.<br>All of that has little to do with the reason for my rambling. We camp often as a family and I&#39;ve developed an interest in &quot;smokeless&quot; fire rings. I&#39;ve found several videos related to both off-the-shelf as well as homebrew versions. Since smoke is a product of incomplete combustion and since you have a predilection for things that burn, routinely work in a field where complete combustion is a critical factor and enjoy making videos, this seems solidly in your wheelhouse. (Being the outdoorsy type, I think your buddy Matt would also share an interest.)", "comment_date": "2021-05-05T14:55:14Z", "likes_count": 2}, {"comment_by": "Cyber Serker", "comment_text": "You went from this to sonar secrets and supersonic baseball cannon", "comment_date": "2021-04-24T00:38:00Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Jakab Gipsz", "comment_text": "Also thank you for the the helicopter underwater video and for the emotional speech...
