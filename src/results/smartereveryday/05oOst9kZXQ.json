Until man can free himself of his hate and greed this can never be done. Only a narcissist can believe he is good enough to start a new colony without such depravity. No matter how hard we try we will always have a negative impact on the place we live because the second law of thermal dynamics state that there is always a loss when energy is transferred. This whole belief that we can transform Mars comes from a ideology that our world started out as nothing and on its own became inhabitable which is a fairytale.

The relevance? Calcium phosphate is what makes up our bones. As you found out, the calcium is lost through our pee, so I helped to lay down a theoretical basis for a way of reclaiming that loss. Take astronaut pee, run it over a bed of these algae, where it will precipitate out. Collect that precipitate and form it into pills, take those pills, and boom, you get calcium phosphate back in your system.

Could you make a video explaining why when I walk outside I walk into spiderwebs?

I suffer from arachnophobia which also for some reason makes me super interested in spiders too. I think its because I am not scared of them but in awe of them as insects. The only conclusion that I can come to is that a spider left a web while traveling. Well think about that for a second, say spider is on a 30 foot tall tree, it by instinct says, &quot;i have this nice rappel coming out of my butt, im going to just jump because i want to go there.&quot; That&#39;s insane. Also a good sub-study would be to understand why spiders travel. Obviously their motivation is survival bases (food, safety etc) but what informs their decisions and how do they even sense to understand their decisions (i.e. how does a tiny little insect brain understand that areas around a light or near high winds would serve the best opportunity to catch flying insects)... <br><br>and if you don&#39;t want to make this video, I still love ya.

Thus, you&#39;d experience the most weight at the top of a squat and the least at the bottom?  Maybe this can be overcome with an elastic band and a spring used together opposing each other&#39;s motion.  The band would probably have to have the same or slightly larger elasticity constant as compared to the spring constant of the spring. This would elminate a varying force with motion.<br>Third question: do astronauts also use medications to prevent bone resorption such as bisphosphonates (alendronate), teriparatide or denosumab?

Accommodating resistance is a training technique that many powerlifters and strongman competitors have used for some time. Attach a band to the ground and to the bar and you can overload your typical working weights, or, change up the load to keep your muscles from adapting as quickly. It seems like having an adjustable band system could accomplish similar enough results with less mass.", "comment_date": "2016-01-01T08:42:54Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "\u0936\u093f\u0935 \u092a\u094d\u0930\u092e\u0924\u093f", "comment_text": "My first 2016 video...And its about space pee... :)", "comment_date": "2016-01-01T08:42:16Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Sam Kudrna", "comment_text": "My favorite part of SmarterEveryDay is when Destin simplifies it down for us, because some of it is so confusion then when he explains it it just clicks and some times like today is very funny.
