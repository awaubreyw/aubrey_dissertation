Most people just say friction.

A low tire can, or more likely a slick spot in the track will, cause that. It&#39;s easily remedied by moving a couple hundred pounds to the side that everyone ahead of you is driving off of, at THE BACK of the tractor.\u00a0 I&#39;ve seen a JD G make the same turn as 1066s at 9500 pounds, and it usually won that class. <br>I&#39;ve moved as little as 250 pounds from center right to far left at the back, and had the only tractor to go straight down the track. <br>Most of these guys are spending cubic money having parts custom built. It takes a lot more creativity making factory parts fit non-factory applications in antique or farm stock, and you get a lot more bang for your buck.\u00a0 These guys won&#39;t make 8 or 9 hooks in a day, let alone go somewhere else and make another 3 or 4 or 5 that evening.", "comment_date": "2022-09-01T17:29:04Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Zvezdan Arsenic", "comment_text": "Southern U.s. looks cool af.

My Grandpa, Lloyd Douglas, RIP.   From Dallas City, Il...was a TRUE pioneer of the sport, he helped design and build the very first transfer sleds with Ollie Schaeffer and the Luedke Family, One of the sleds I remember was the JUDGE, it read, &quot;Here Comes Da JUDGE!!&quot; on the side.  He was also one of the first announcers, and probably had more time on a microphone than Howard Cossell... before that he made the very FIRST sled. He flattened out a big metal tank off an old oil truck, into the shape of a toboggan. Men would line both sides of the track, and jump on as it went by, holding on to each other tight I&#39;m sure.. the farther down the track, more men, more weight, until they stopped the tractor, YEEHAA, I actually remember some like that!! He pulled the first gasoline burning, diesel tractor with 4 turbochargers, yep, 4, an old Cockshut Super 570 in the 5000 and 7000lb Super Stock Class. He was called.. &quot;Super Cecil Diesel&quot;  and that tractor is still being driven in local parades by another relative. He pulled the ole Cockshut Super for 16 yrs, then became the lead announcer for The National Tractor Pullers Association and Agri-Shows, From the Dairyland Grand Nationals to the Superdome, for another 11 years!!. As well as many Stock Car Races and Air Shows.  He was even involved in the build of the very first BigFoot monster truck, and was instrumental in the introduction of Truck Pulls and the modern versions of the Monster Trucks.... AND I got to spend as much time on the road with him and Grandma as Mom would allow! The whole time I was growing up, I knew every puller, EVERY tractor, and they knew me... It was really like a big family ...  I miss those days and I really miss them, but Lord thank you for blessing me with the time spent and memories I still cherish..... and all that was a small fraction of his accomplishments...

It seems that this must be true since the tractor wheelies even though the drawbar is below the axel.

He seems to have said that HE controls how fast the box moves forward.  I always thought that the forward motion of the sled translated into forward motion of the box.  If the tractor pulls faster, the box goes faster.  If the tractor goes slower, the box goes slower.  So that any way you do it, the box travels x number feet forward for X feet forward of the sled (or tractor).  But if Brian controls the forward movement of the box, then the trial is different for each different tractor and you no longer have an equal comparison, or equal competition.    Brian can give more forward motion for Tractor 1, than he does for Tractor 2.

As my grandfather was one of the main organizers of the show, and so my family always got roped into helping out.  Over the years, my mother side of the family would dwindle down until it was just me and my Aunt who would run this peddle tractor pull. Now the thing with the peddle tractor and the sled for the pull is that my Grandfather built them.  And they were a blast to peddle around on even when i was well into my early twenties. But they were like well engineered machines, that were built but it was always the sled the got my attention. It was just a simple machine that when you engaged the clutch on it as the wheels moved on the back it would drive a chain and move the weights closer to the top, and as such create more force on the pan creating more friction, and thus more resistance to over come (i haven&#39;t seen the video yet so my apologies, if it is covered or my assumption is wrong.) But i would like to add to this one learning i took about why my assumption was that it is friction and resistance caused by the weights getting closer to the pan. One year when I was still competing in the peddle tractor pull, we got over 160 lbs (mechanical advantage from gears helped i guess) but we were pretty heavy and my uncle was getting tired of thia going on. So he runs and comes back with a chain. And attached the chain to the sled. So once the chain drags under the sled and the weight moves above the pan. It digs into the ground deeper making more resistance to over come.  Anyways that chain was humbling children ever since.", "comment_date": "2022-08-28T02:48:08Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Kew Akl", "comment_text": "The [CC] failed humorously at <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VZ6_8WJ3mh8&amp;t=12m40s\">12:40</a>.", "comment_date": "2022-08-28T02:47:34Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Dan Miller", "comment_text": "I watched this video to confirm my own knowledge of tractor pulls.

Bekker developed equations to describe the shear strength of the soil which were further refined by another scientist Jo Y. Wong. (It&#39;s worth mentioning that Bekker was also involved in developing the Lunar Roving Vehicles.) So, with the Bekker-Wong equations, we can develop a curve for fairly accurately predicting soil behavior and therefore traction with a few inputs. The guys in the video with the sticks: they were performing crude bevameter tests which is a way of measuring and characterizing the shear strength of the soil. They were testing the soil and through experience and intuition getting the information that normally a ton of math would get you!

The tractors were handicapped in a manner of speaking, the more horsepower your tractor, the greater the weight they put on the sled. Now, at the end of the competition, they decided to run the fastest tractor against a pair of Clydesdale horses. The fieldays are always in the winter and by the end of the competition the track was very muddy, about ankle deep. This \u2018super\u2019 tractor obviously had a lot of horsepower and consequently a very heavy sled, the two horses were obviously 2 horsepower and had an empty sled. Now when they started off, the horses were able to plunge their hooves down through the mud and get traction on the firm soil under the mud but the tractor had real trouble spinning in the mud. The result was that the horses won and were well  on their way through a victory lap before the tractor had reached the end.

Last Saturday, I saw my first tractor pull ever at the Tennessee State Fair In Lebanon, TN. Here are a few of my thoughts. <br><br>1.  I get the power part of tractor pulling but speed is a component also. The faster they get off the line and down the track before the sled sets down, it seems to me the further they go.   So, why not have a couple of gears to get them down fast and then change for power. <br><br>2.  It seems to me that they are competing over only a couple of inches. Therefore, although I thought it was cool with all the power and raw engine noise, at some point I got a little bored because as far as I could tell, they were all pulling about the same distance. Now, I only was there for the souped up pickup trucks. Maybe if I was there for the big tractors I would think differently. <br><br>3.  I get a kick out of Destin.

The lower the hitch point, the less the front end gets pulled upwards. It counteracts the torque that the motor applies to the rear wheels, which is trying to pull a wheelie when pulling a heavy load with good traction. In normal tractor work this is part of the genius of how the three point hitch system helps keep tractors from pulling wheelies when pulling plows and the like. \r<br>In these competitions, you want to get max traction on the rear wheels. So getting all the weight on the rear wheels is desirable. You want to pull a slight wheelie. Put the hitch point too low and your front wheels will never leave the ground and you will not get max traction on the rear wheels.\r<br>Of course this a balancing act. If your front wheels lift too easy, you&#39;ll either dig the rear skids into the ground and reduce your traction and increase the resistance against forward motion. Or you&#39;ll have to back off the throttle to keep that from happening. Either will reduce your forward momentum.", "comment_date": "2022-08-27T14:47:58Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "tv athome", "comment_text": "What a beautiful look at a beautiful part of the world.<br>Good people having fun.", "comment_date": "2022-08-27T14:47:32Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "jimmy cokeanhour", "comment_text": "I&#39;m getting into truck pulling and thoroughly enjoyed this video thanks Dustin for highlighting this sport \ud83d\udc4d", "comment_date": "2022-08-27T14:47:13Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Zaid huuuu\ud83c\udf1f", "comment_text": "<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VZ6_8WJ3mh8&amp;t=7m24s\">7:24</a> That boy is a king\ud83d\udc51....", "comment_date": "2022-08-27T14:45:57Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Hani Allelli", "comment_text": "Fkng up the environment for no reason \u2026 good job", "comment_date": "2022-08-27T14:45:47Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Olle Hellman", "comment_text": "How would an electric tractor fare?", "comment_date": "2022-08-27T14:44:40Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "M", "comment_text": "Always loved this channel, after seeing this episode I love it twice as much!", "comment_date": "2022-08-27T14:43:59Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "tbh9088", "comment_text": "Peter at <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VZ6_8WJ3mh8&amp;t=18m00s\">18:00</a>: he talk funny.", "comment_date": "2022-08-27T14:43:30Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "jonser20Cent", "comment_text": "Great show, never guessed that I needed to know about tractor pulls and I love these real  folks.

It&#39;s absolutely wild to me that anyone would ever be allowed to just walk about with a gun and seeing it makes me question why people do it. It doesn&#39;t make sense to me and I can&#39;t support that. In what world is carrying a gun in everyday life seen as &quot;freedom&quot;? (going to a shooting range or simply just owning guns is a different thing) The shady workshops you went to in the beginning were repelling, but in hindsight worth visiting. And those tractors&#39; exhausts are craaazy. That feels like a climate desaster right there every time a tractorpull happens\ud83d\ude01 I have to respect your way of dealing with these people though.
