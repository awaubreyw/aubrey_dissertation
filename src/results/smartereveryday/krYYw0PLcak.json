The characters you use to identify brown recluse are misleading (i.e., no comparison with similarly-colored, co-occurring filistatids and phoclids); your statement about them biting only 50% of people with which they come in contact is preposterous, even though your overall message that they are not aggressive is accurate (you may be thinking about aggression studies on black widows, which showed much less than 50% biting frequency, but as far as I know these studies have not even been conducted for brown recluse); the bit about them &quot;hiding in bedsheets&quot; and &quot;getting them out  of the closet&quot; only to be bitten shortly after is misleading since clearly millions of people live with huge populations of these spiders and receive no bites (i.e., no need for fear-mongering rhetoric); perhaps most importantly, the connection between brown recluse bites and most of those huge necrotic lesions found with google searches is essentially internet hype (most of those lesions are thought to be caused by other factors such as flesh-eating bacteria). Should brown recluse venom be respected? Absolutely. Recluse spiders have powerful venom that can produce painful reactions. But there is no need to perpetuate the misinformed hype about the species. Better to do as you have done with so many of your other videos to protect your daughter against misinformation: seek well-supported evidence for claims. Finally, I&#39;m no PETA supporter... but yea... that&#39;s a messed up way to handle a spider. Countless others are photographing much more dangerous species with lesser equipment.

The pain comes within 1-12 hours. I will post my own YouTube video of how I saved my thumb and finger and what you can do if you find that you have been bitten. This is not a way to avoid medical help! You will want all of the help you can get! The wolf spider will chase humans if you are too close to their nest and I know this because I was chased and bitten by one while gardening. They do hurt when they bite but it is more like a bee sting and goes away quickly without going to the hospital. In case you are not sure which type bit you, you can tell by the pain and they rapid necrosis if it is a brown recluse. Seek help from a trained physician!

That is why the venom dissolves flesh like it does. I was told it will even dissolve bone but I have not verified that. The are shy and the main reason they bite is because we use bug spray which does not kill them but gives them nerve damage and makes them aggressive and crazy. Insecticides do not kill these spiders most of the time. It does damage them and they wander around and bite even though it is not really their nature. It is very rare to get bitten by one who is not damage by bug spray.<br><br>So if you see one do not spray it. I cannot tell you to try to relocate it because it is dangerous and you have to do what you think is best. But if you kill it do not torture it. That is wrong no matter how you try to justify it. just kill it and be done with it.<br><br>On a final note, house spiders, wolf spiders and black widows are their major predators. They like to walk along the floorboard as they do not see very well and cobweb spiders feast on them. I never kill house spiders. i will relocate wolf spiders back outside when they get too big to live in the house. But for the most part I have lots of different spiders in my house. On the up side I have no roaches or other pest and I do not have to call an exterminator. :)", "comment_date": "2014-08-20T20:39:18Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Tyler Ritter", "comment_text": "FIRE WILL CLEANSE THERE EVIL SOLE ", "comment_date": "2014-08-18T11:58:48Z", "likes_count": 22}, {"comment_by": "AJ", "comment_text": "Can anyone tell me why he specifically says to and performs killing the spider with fire?

He did not bite me, so I took him outside and set him free. Of course, I do not have a child to worry about. I think the house spiders kept the recluses out and when there were no humans to attract food insects for them, they died off and the recluse, which needs less resources, moved in. Moral?

Fact #1 More people die from Brown Recluse bites than any other spider in the US. Fact #2 most folks don&#39;t understand the nature of &quot;Hemotoxins&quot; - The venom of the Brown Recluse acts like acid on animal (human) flesh and even more drastically on internal organ tissue. A victim bitten on the neck or near other major arteries can die in less than an hour if the toxins make their way to the heart, dissolving it as it beats. Case #1. My father was bitten on the top of his foot by one in the Caribbean, it took three days before he was able to get to a US hospital that recognized what it was. He didn&#39;t die because of poor circulation in his feet but his main artery had turned black half way up his leg. By the time the wound was finally irrigated and cleared of toxins, he had a hole in the top of his foot the size of a silver dollar that burrowed past the bones and tendons of his foot. It took several skin grafts and nearly six months to heal this wound. These are EXTREMELY dangerous spiders and very difficult to spot and we have every right to be cautious of them!
