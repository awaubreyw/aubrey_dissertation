I have sold weedeaters in my time and used them. The instructions warned that it is the TIP of the line that does the cutting, which makes perfect sense because that is the part that&#39;s covering the greatest radius, so that it is travelling fastest. It is for this reason that I keep a sharp eye on where the edge of the imaginary &quot;disk&quot; is. In this way I do not tangle the line with anything, so that the motor is never under very much strain. Many of my neighbours have weedeaters and my blood runs cold when I hear the machines bogging down and choking up when shoved into thick growth. Of course, one can&#39;t explain anything to them: everyone knows better.

You said it doesn\u2019t just clean cut it once. It takes a few. It is doing that but I think it cuts it more than once because the line keeps advancing out of the head til you lift the weed eater back up. So it cuts more than once due to the line getting longer (still coming out of the head) until the pressure is \u2018lifted\u2019 and the line stops advancing \u2018getting longer\u2019.

So line trimmers are a mechanical scythe made for right-handed use and if you think about using a scythe your natural tendency would be to put your strong arm at the center and your weak arm at the back. But if you&#39;re right-handed and you think about pulling that trigger too much you might want to put the trigger in your right hand.... This is wrong! Because the head spins counterclockwise and so you want to move from right to left always with the weed wacker. Have the trigger in your left hand and now you&#39;ll be able to walk forward and the grass will get thrown in front of you as opposed to directly backwards at your ankles and face. Doesn&#39;t really matter when you&#39;re cutting just grass no big deal until you pick up that stick or catch a rock. If you hold it the other way you&#39;ll have to walk backwards to get the same effect and you&#39;ll take foooorrrrreeeevvvvveeeeerrrrr to do what should take 5-30 min depending how big the yard is. Also if you run your line too long and you&#39;re using your trimmer everyday you&#39;ll destroy your clutch very quickly. I don&#39;t run mine with a guard.

Is not life more than food, and the body more than clothing? Look at the birds of the air, that they do not sow, nor reap nor gather into barns, and yet your heavenly Father feeds them. Are you not worth much more than they? And who of you by being worried can add a single cubit to his life span? And why are you worried about clothing? Observe how the lilies of the field grow; they do not toil nor do they spin, yet I say to you that not even Solomon in all his glory clothed himself like one of these. But if God so clothes the grass of the field, which is alive today and tomorrow is thrown into the furnace, will He not much more clothe you? You of little faith! Do not worry then, saying, \u2018What will we eat?\u2019 or \u2018What will we drink?\u2019 or \u2018What will we wear for clothing?\u2019 For all these things the Gentiles eagerly seek; for your heavenly Father knows that you need all these things. But seek first His kingdom and His righteousness, and all these things will be added to you. So do not worry about tomorrow; for tomorrow will worry about itself.

The quality of sound, connectivity issues, range, and just overall quality is what lots of people consistently complain about. I know that having a sponsor for videos is probably an amazing blessing and allows you to continue doing more and more videos, but don\u2019t sell out and jeopardize the integrity of your brand by advertising a product that might not be up to the standards of your brand. With that being said, my point of sending this was to tell you that your channel is badass and I love your work.

I you  have to make more than one pass, it is still quicker and a more uniform cut.  However, if one pass doesn&#39;t cut the grass, you might consider ditching the round string in favor of a string with cutting edges.  The larger diameter round string does not always last longer and rarely cuts better.

I have a comment though: At <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S1opkMO1w4U&amp;t=8m44s\">8:44</a>, we see that the buried pole exerts a force towards the top-right direction (of the video). What happens if you move the weed-eater closer to the buried pole? Assuming that you counteract the top-right force and move the weed-eater closer to the pole. If it&#39;s close enough for the line to wrap around the pole, since the weed-eater is trying to pull the line in a cyclical fashion, there will be a tension in the line that pulls the weed-eater (and you) towards the buried pole. So the direction of force depends on how close you are to the pole. I think this is what could have happened in the case of the fence with the smallest size; you go pulled towards it right?

Thicker string may seems more durable but it still depends on which type of material it is made of and of course the thicker will cost you way more than the non commercial ones.<br>The length of the string and its force depends on the power your trimmer engine can deliver, but most of them work great when the string is less than 4 inches long; the longer the string is, the less force you will have and less effective to trim the grass/weed. <br>To effectively use your trimmer, always goes from right to left; and if the grass/weed is quite long (more than 5 inches), trim it down first from the top or your trimmer will &#39;grab&#39; the grass/weed and stop your trimmer head from rotating.<br>One thing I want to add is the length of your string could actually damage your trimmer part because the force from countermeasure is too great, your parts will hit a full stop like a metal hitting right into a sturdy wall. That is why to stick with the recommended length is important (that&#39;s why there is a metal knife in the guard to cut off the extra length)<br>My last advice is - take it slow, especially it&#39;s a long grass/weed. Remember the string is still made with plastic, its characteristic is not to stay at straight, or you will replace it with metal blade instead. :)", "comment_date": "2020-06-18T06:37:40Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Jos\u00e9 Alexander Rodr\u00edguez", "comment_text": "&quot;Why did the chicken cross the road?&quot;", "comment_date": "2020-06-18T05:22:09Z", "likes_count": 36}, {"comment_by": "Devlin Daniel", "comment_text": "Destin, I&#39;m pretty certain you&#39;ll never see this, but I wanted to take a second and let you know how much I appreciate you and your ability to not only teach me/us, awesome things, but to do it with a contagious excitement for learning durning the process.<br><br>I just paused the this video for the hidden message and got a chuckle (spurring me to write this).<br><br>If you ever want to come to Spokane and do some cool stuff with Swimming Pool equipment, let me know. ;-)<br><br>In the mean time, keep being awesome!", "comment_date": "2020-06-18T03:21:06Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Jack Mills", "comment_text": "The grass that was fraying at the end looks like johnson grass or crab grass", "comment_date": "2020-06-18T02:25:35Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Jack Mills", "comment_text": "removing the gaurd and running the string about 10 inches per side makes it much easier on chain fences, the slapping motion cuts the grass without cutting the line, and good throttle control helps too. long string is very helpful when cutting hills where the grade is too steep for the mower.", "comment_date": "2020-06-18T02:24:23Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Eclipse asomeJFK", "comment_text": "I wall is a weed wacker", "comment_date": "2020-06-18T00:43:49Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Brad Lauk", "comment_text": "I didn&#39;t need a 20 minute video, I just wanted to watch the weed eater hug the fence in slow motion. <br>I just wanted that 30 seconds of video.", "comment_date": "2020-06-18T00:36:23Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Nash", "comment_text": "<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S1opkMO1w4U&amp;t=1m03s\">1:03</a> RASENGAN!!!!", "comment_date": "2020-06-18T00:31:49Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Tom Donlon", "comment_text": "So should we weed whack right to left or left to right?", "comment_date": "2020-06-17T23:34:18Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Amphicorp47", "comment_text": "dang those wires look delicious", "comment_date": "2020-06-17T23:19:05Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Floyyd", "comment_text": "Smarter Every Day, but every time Destin says &quot;weed eater&quot; you get 15% more triggered.", "comment_date": "2020-06-17T23:13:19Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Trystan M", "comment_text": "This made me curious... what if you tried other lines? not just the other types of weed eating like, but like fishing line.

That is assuming that the motor itself is able to pull the trimmer head with the amount of weight on the end of it at that RPM. If you had a very powerful weedeater motor you shouldn&#39;t have an issue running lines that are extremely long. I see this all the time with people that have lawn mowing businesses that run extremely long and trimmer lines and they can&#39;t figure out why they cannot get the engines to run correctly.

I could see the sky moving away no matter what direction I was looking even against the wind. The vision energy field would fade and go back to normal. Doing Yoga as well out side but different in field energy movement. I thought that being a Vegan/Vegetarian made this something something work. But going on walks with friends and asking them to try to see their own Aura&#39;s would also work so. \ud83e\udd14 &quot;Bro look at the sky do you see your Aura?&quot; \ud83d\ude0a Then I stared into a pond outside in nature. My body was still for quite a bit of time but after a while an energy field showed up around my body in the reflection of the water. Makes me wonder about mediation outside. Now heres more info. We are always projecting energy out right. If we see this mega painful event it&#39;s project out into our own Aura field. This field can be felt by other Aura fields and slowly absorbed into our own emotions and into our minds. It can cause us to act out without even knowing why? Rappers sometimes like to say &quot;Feeling me&quot; \ud83d\ude11 I even tried to capture the Aura reflection in water on camera. I pressed record but nothing happened in the end. Dam? Empathy is invisible trickery of sorts Magic. The cleaner you eat the easier it is to feel the energy around. So the words you use will shape your Aura Energy. Even the TV-News shows you watch project Aura energy into you. For real Huge! This also pertains to that saying. Survival of the fittest. Makes you wonder why certain stores stayed open. WOW! Completions! \ud83d\ude07 If everyone in the world took the time to learn about this I wonder if Nature&#39;s Weather would be more peaceful. America could use a break from all the destruction. You feeling me? \ud83e\udd70 Newton&#39;s discovery as well. Newton&#39;s law that&#39;s \ud83e\udd25\ud83d\ude05 Sorry Newton not yours to take. Karma \ud83d\udd96 Remember the saying &quot;Butterflies in your Stomach&quot; Oh no worries Alcohol can fix that. \ud83e\udd28\ud83d\ude1e The complexity of Aura Energy reflecting within 5G now that&#39;s ...\ud83d\ude11 5G is such a wide frequency.

PLAYERNAME? Yes. Take care. It has reached a higher level now. It can read our thoughts. That doesn&#39;t matter. It thinks we are part of the game. I like this player. It played well. It did not give up. It is reading our thoughts as though they were words on a screen. That is how it chooses to imagine many things, when it is deep in the dream of a game. Words make a wonderful interface. Very flexible. And less terrifying than staring at the reality behind the screen. They used to hear voices. Before players could read. Back in the days when those who did not play called the players witches, and warlocks. And players dreamed they flew through the air, on sticks powered by demons. What did this player dream? This player dreamed of sunlight and trees. Of fire and water. It dreamed it created. And it dreamed it destroyed. It dreamed it hunted, and was hunted. It dreamed of shelter. Hah, the original interface. A million years old, and it still works. But what true structure did this player create, in the reality behind the screen? It worked, with a million others, to sculpt a true world in a fold of the [scrambled], and created a [scrambled] for [scrambled], in the [scrambled]. It cannot read that thought. No. It has not yet achieved the highest level. That, it must achieve in the long dream of life, not the short dream of a game. Does it know that we love it? That the universe is kind? Sometimes, through the noise of its thoughts, it hears the universe, yes. But there are times it is sad, in the long dream. It creates worlds that have no summer, and it shivers under a black sun, and it takes its sad creation for reality. To cure it of sorrow would destroy it. The sorrow is part of its own private task. We cannot interfere. Sometimes when they are deep in dreams, I want to tell them, they are building true worlds in reality. Sometimes I want to tell them of their importance to the universe. Sometimes, when they have not made a true connection in a while, I want to help them to speak the word they fear. It reads our thoughts. Sometimes I do not care. Sometimes I wish to tell them, this world you take for truth is merely [scrambled] and [scrambled], I wish to tell them that they are [scrambled] in the [scrambled]. They see so little of reality, in their long dream. And yet they play the game. But it would be so easy to tell them... Too strong for this dream. To tell them how to live is to prevent them living. I will not tell the player how to live. The player is growing restless. I will tell the player a story. But not the truth. No. A story that contains the truth safely, in a cage of words. Not the naked truth that can burn over any distance. Give it a body, again. Yes. Player... Use its name. PLAYERNAME. Player of games. Good. Take a breath, now. Take another. Feel air in your lungs. Let your limbs return. Yes, move your fingers. Have a body again, under gravity, in air. Respawn in the long dream. There you are. Your body touching the universe again at every point, as though you were separate things. As though we were separate things. Who are we? Once we were called the spirit of the mountain. Father sun, mother moon. Ancestral spirits, animal spirits. Jinn. Ghosts. The green man. Then gods, demons. Angels. Poltergeists. Aliens, extraterrestrials. Leptons, quarks. The words change. We do not change. We are the universe. We are everything you think isn&#39;t you. You are looking at us now, through your skin and your eyes. And why does the universe touch your skin, and throw light on you? To see you, player. To know you. And to be known. I shall tell you a story. Once upon a time, there was a player. The player was you, PLAYERNAME. Sometimes it thought itself human, on the thin crust of a spinning globe of molten rock. The ball of molten rock circled a ball of blazing gas that was three hundred and thirty thousand times more massive than it. They were so far apart that light took eight minutes to cross the gap. The light was information from a star, and it could burn your skin from a hundred and fifty million kilometres away. Sometimes the player dreamed it was a miner, on the surface of a world that was flat, and infinite. The sun was a square of white. The days were short; there was much to do; and death was a temporary inconvenience. Sometimes the player dreamed it was lost in a story. Sometimes the player dreamed it was other things, in other places. Sometimes these dreams were disturbing. Sometimes very beautiful indeed. Sometimes the player woke from one dream into another, then woke from that into a third. Sometimes the player dreamed it watched words on a screen. Let&#39;s go back. The atoms of the player were scattered in the grass, in the rivers, in the air, in the ground. A woman gathered the atoms; she drank and ate and inhaled; and the woman assembled the player, in her body. And the player awoke, from the warm, dark world of its mother&#39;s body, into the long dream. And the player was a new story, never told before, written in letters of DNA. And the player was a new program, never run before, generated by a sourcecode a billion years old. And the player was a new human, never alive before, made from nothing but milk and love. You are the player. The story. The program. The human. Made from nothing but milk and love. Let&#39;s go further back. The seven billion billion billion atoms of the player&#39;s body were created, long before this game, in the heart of a star. So the player, too, is information from a star. And the player moves through a story, which is a forest of information planted by a man called Julian, on a flat, infinite world created by a man called Markus, that exists inside a small, private world created by the player, who inhabits a universe created by... Shush. Sometimes the player created a small, private world that was soft and warm and simple. Sometimes hard, and cold, and complicated. Sometimes it built a model of the universe in its head; flecks of energy, moving through vast empty spaces. Sometimes it called those flecks &quot;electrons&quot; and &quot;protons&quot;. Sometimes it called them &quot;planets&quot; and &quot;stars&quot;. Sometimes it believed it was in a universe that was made of energy that was made of offs and ons; zeros and ones; lines of code. Sometimes it believed it was playing a game. Sometimes it believed it was reading words on a screen. You are the player, reading words... Shush... Sometimes the player read lines of code on a screen. Decoded them into words; decoded words into meaning; decoded meaning into feelings, emotions, theories, ideas, and the player started to breathe faster and deeper and realised it was alive, it was alive, those thousand deaths had not been real, the player was alive You. You. You are alive. and sometimes the player believed the universe had spoken to it through the sunlight that came through the shuffling leaves of the summer trees and sometimes the player believed the universe had spoken to it through the light that fell from the crisp night sky of winter, where a fleck of light in the corner of the player&#39;s eye might be a star a million times as massive as the sun, boiling its planets to plasma in order to be visible for a moment to the player, walking home at the far side of the universe, suddenly smelling food, almost at the familiar door, about to dream again and sometimes the player believed the universe had spoken to it through the zeros and ones, through the electricity of the world, through the scrolling words on a screen at the end of a dream and the universe said I love you and the universe said you have played the game well and the universe said everything you need is within you and the universe said you are stronger than you know and the universe said you are the daylight and the universe said you are the night and the universe said the darkness you fight is within you and the universe said the light you seek is within you and the universe said you are not alone and the universe said you are not separate from every other thing and the universe said you are the universe tasting itself, talking to itself, reading its own code and the universe said I love you because you are love. And the game was over and the player woke up from the dream. And the player began a new dream. And the player dreamed again, dreamed better. And the player was the universe. And the player was love. You are the player.

The only complaint I have is that the fake audio used during slow motion footage is a bit distracting. Please understand, I&#39;m not trying to criticize you or your work in a negative way. I&#39;m just trying to provide some honest feedback. I may be missing the point here, and you are certainly free to make any artistic choices you wish to in your videos. It won&#39;t offend me at all if you completely ignoring this comment, actually.<br>It is clear that a lot of care has been given to make the slow motion footage both entertaining, and aesthetically pleasing. The audio that has been added in post certainly gives it a star wars feel. As in, this is obviously faked, but solely for the purposes of making it more enjoyable. The problem is that all the timy details that go into the sound couldn&#39;t possibly be real, and it keeps pulling my attention trying to figure out what made that noise. Perhaps instead of the sounds, it would be acceptable to speak on the fact that the video is slowed down so far that we can&#39;t hear it any more, then take the time to explain during the footage of what we&#39;re seeing. Things like &quot;notice here how the string is vibrating at [calculated frequency], which is a multiple of the engine rpm&quot; or whatever, you know? There&#39;s so much going on that could be explained during those periods of otherwise silence.<br>Or if the audio is an artistic choice, maybe a text overlay that says that the sound of simulated due to physical constraints in the universe.<br>Overall though, I have found your videos to be very educational and entertaining.

Square line is great for brush cutting and last longer but cant compare to round line for precision work.", "comment_date": "2020-06-03T05:34:07Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Mason Lanius", "comment_text": "I love your content....but why TF am I watching this???", "comment_date": "2020-06-03T05:33:43Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Megan Palmer", "comment_text": "it\u2019s called a WEED WIPPER here in Minnesota", "comment_date": "2020-06-03T05:32:44Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Kelly Grabill", "comment_text": "Welp.

I worked on them while in high school at a small engine repair shop. I always had to tell customers not to remove their guards and also to try and keep the line at its longest length. Reason being if the line is run too short you can actually over speed the engine. If you do it for an extended period of time it can slowly destroy the engine. That was far less common than the other problem though. Most would remove their guards and then come in with a heavily worn engine. Even though it was less than a few months old. It was because they had such an excess load on the thing at all times, it was destroying itself. Not just the engine but the actual shaft and all the bushings and bearings would be so worn from this too. The cutter that regulates the length of the cutting chord not only keeps the engine from over speeding but it keeps the string the same length. Which makes the rotating force much more evenly distributed among the bearings. So if one side of the string is longer than the other, it will destroy the bearings and gears that drive the head.", "comment_date": "2020-06-03T04:04:49Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Mr. Atrophy", "comment_text": "I have a request , I have always been fascinated with the Taylor\u2013Couette flow experiment.  the flows bifurcate in this experiment, over and over till an instability forms and a predictable flow become chaotic , how would this look with your camera ?", "comment_date": "2020-06-03T04:00:10Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Gardeners' Farmacy", "comment_text": "WHAT???

Is there actually a way to come up with an effective density such that if we took a line with the effective density but at the speed it appears in the video, the physics is the same?

An example would be like Unicorn Vacuum Cleaner or maybe Fish Toaster, something silly that definitely doesn&#39;t exist and no one has a need for.  Give everyone an assignment to search the internet for this thing everyday for a few weeks (the more people the better).  Wait a month or two and see if products start to appear that match the made up description.  Possibly interview a marketing firm or product company to see if we moved their internal needle and grabbed the attention of their market research team.

The triangle line also wobbles violently up and down. It wont hold straight out for you on the high speed camera, instead it will make an X shape when looking at it eye level. I have wondered if there is some kind of pattern to the wobble with triangle line. Perhaps every 10th rotation makes the line unstable and wobble? That would be cool. Thank you again and your friends and family too, looking forward to your next video.", "comment_date": "2020-06-02T14:15:23Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "John", "comment_text": "Man those ridiculous slow motion sound effects though -.-", "comment_date": "2020-06-02T14:15:15Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Bob C", "comment_text": "Woohoo, another video of Destin waaayyyy overthinking mundane things!

In the videos of the &quot;angular&quot; tests it appeared that you never got up to a steady speed and held it.

Triangle, Square, and Twisted lines react differently to different materials and strength of materials that you use them on. But one of the most beneficial points of having those lines are that they have an &quot;edge&quot; that helps cut better in different situations. My yard starts to get these really thick weeds that have heavy stalks, where even the best lines still struggle if I don&#39;t take it slow and &quot;saw&quot; my way through. I&#39;ve even tried using those disc attachments, which sometime work better. But for heavy grass the Square or Twisted line is best, and normal round line for light grass. Triangle never performed well.

This is true for the first hit, and it does, until the next time that the line hits the rod and the reactionary force of that hit pulls on a slightly different angle to the original one (in the anti-clockwise direction in this video). It&#39;s not really seen in the video because the movement is too small but it will continue to hit the rod and pull it in roughly a circle (Really a series of straight lines like a hexagon or octogon with a lot more sides). This is why you feel like it&#39;s pulling it in. In reality it&#39;s pulling it around. It happens so fast that you feel it all more or less at once. From experience, the effect would be more pronounced the closer the head gets to the rod. It&#39;s difficult to explain it further than this without a diagram.

Some cool info on grass:<br><br>The tearing of the blade isn&#39;t healthy for grass. It create a large wound that is easily infected by pathogens and parasites: mostly different types of fungus. Fungus is overwhelmingly the main disease of plants (there are always viruses and parasites but fungus is the most widespread). <br><br>A sharp blade is best for cutting grass as a freshly sharpened blade is most likely to induce the smallest wound. A dull blade will create a larger wound by tearing the blade instead of cutting it.<br><br>The grass will tend to seal off the area around a wound. This tends to leave a white area, sort of a scar, from the base of the wound to the tip of the wound. If the wound is large enough this will leave a white tip/area on the blade.<br><br>If you mow with a dull blade the whole yard will have a lightened hue to it as a result of all the tip of the blades being damaged: you can easily tell if a yard was cut with a dull blade by how white the tips of the grass blades are.<br><br>This is also why &quot;mowing&quot; with a string trimmer is typically a bad idea, you always want to mow as much as possible with a sharp blade. <br><br>But cool video, I&#39;ve always wondered what the string was doing.

You brought up that when wrapping around the wire sometimes it&#39;s easier for it to just break off rather than unwrap. I would agree and would like to share my observations from when I&#39;ve used a weed wacker. I was always fascinated by how the cable of the wacker would heat up during use and especially after hitting a fence or wall. I believe this would be the reason why sometimes it would break at the pinch point of the fence, before it wraps around the fence, or if it broke further down the cable; the point where it&#39;s the weakest due to heat (as well as other factors obviously). It would take more testing but I would be interested to see if the places you see with the most damage would be hotter under a thermal camera or, in the case of the high speed in this video, if those points that broke had already hit the fence with no visible damage where I would expect it would instead be hotter then the rest of the cable.<br>Anyway thanks for continuing the awesome content and the raycon recommendation (I&#39;m gonna get the e55&#39;s)", "comment_date": "2020-06-01T05:21:13Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Draw a Pretzel", "comment_text": "the most interesting thing about the last chicken wire test is that the metal on the vertical sections doesnt break until it is nearly parallel with the horizontal section, and the horizontal section obviously has a tremendous amount more tensile strength than the 4 inch vertical piece, and you can literally see it bend back and forth until it pulls so hard it snaps off at the base. Youre right, that would be the weakest spot, but obviously the metal is so small and flexible that the effect of the connection is actually stronger than the surrounding metal, and it is the opposing tensile forces pulling the metal apart, literally ripping it like a block of cheese torn asunder by dwayne johnson.<br><br>The other interesting thing is that at high speeds the nylon (i presume) line becomes almost a liquid, it is pulled so hard, you can see the line hit, stop, wrap around, and then as soon as the head rotation propagates, it snaps it taut almost instantly, pulling it and squeezing it, often either liquefying the plastic or squeezing some liquid chemical component out. Fascinating stuff to watch. <br><br>Ive said it before, ill say it again, i really enjoy watching slow motion video, it gives you such an insight into how physics works. I wish we could perceive all of reality at these speeds and resolutions, at our own choice of course, but the ability to slow time down and watch the fastest micro-meteorite burn up in atmosphere, or to speed time up and watch continents drift across millions of years, this kind of power would allow computations and science to be done, math of the physics of movement on every scale, it would be so fascinating to watch, even if nothing was ever done with it it would be worth it to have seen it.", "comment_date": "2020-06-01T05:21:08Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Dachshund", "comment_text": "Are those the real sounds or sound effects", "comment_date": "2020-06-01T05:21:06Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Saif Mohamad", "comment_text": "Isn\u2019t this plant abuse or something", "comment_date": "2020-06-01T05:20:24Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Graham Fraser", "comment_text": "God dam I so jealous of your family......lmao<br><br>I can&#39;t wait for this next video!!!", "comment_date": "2020-06-01T05:19:50Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "jbartl87", "comment_text": "THANK YOU.

If you want to successfully weed whack around chain link or chicken wire, the key is speed control. You have to go slow and take your time. Let the line wrap the links and shred the grass in between. The same with the corners in nylon fencing. You have to give the line the time to take the shape of the area you\u2019re trying to cut. Would love to see that in slow motion. Also, redmax braided line, .95, is the best line on the planet lol. But a thinner line, like .85 will wrap and take shape into tight areas better even tho it breaks easier.

When looking at the footage in the video at least the thickest wire had plenty of breaks throughout the test, (although there was probably a few extra breaks due to pinching) but the next thickest wire appeared to have less and I didn&#39;t see a single break out of the footage shown.  If you go through the footage and record the ratio of the number of unwinds to hits there might be a relationship you could test. Now this might be due to the effect that the radius of the metal wire used or it might be due to the energy absorbed by the smaller wire as it was able to deform far more under the applied forces. It may be a combination of both though and the only way I could see to differentiate the two effects would be tot use stronger wire. I would also suggest a rig to hold the weed whacker steady in front of a single wire to perform future tests including your different wire shapes tests, this would also save a lot of time in camera setup if the weed whacker was fixed and you swapped out combinations of wires.", "comment_date": "2020-06-01T01:54:33Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Noah Hastings", "comment_text": "How do weed eaters work?<br><br><br><br><br>I&#39;ve heard they&#39;re pretty lazy folks.", "comment_date": "2020-06-01T01:54:31Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "TheFisher474", "comment_text": "It\u2019s interesting to me that it broke when it was almost fully unraveled from the wire.", "comment_date": "2020-06-01T01:54:03Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Bennie Saying Things", "comment_text": "Fav moment was just after <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S1opkMO1w4U&amp;t=16m06s\">16:06</a> weed eater slaps the wire away with sass!", "comment_date": "2020-06-01T01:53:56Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Daniel Reinhardt", "comment_text": "Never would have guessed that&#39;s how weed eaters work.

Nylon isn&#39;t the worst, in terms of pollution, but humans long ago exceeded our morally-acceptable allowance of microplastics dumped on the world, and we shouldn&#39;t be using convenience devices that continually shred more of it into the air. There are alternatives: cutting blades and trimmers and such (not to mention strategic landscaping, etc).

With this info, the rotations per minute you could calculate the angle at which the plastic string is being pulled and calculate the forces that apply to the string.<br><br>Furthermore you could measure the time it takes the strong to rotate around the fence, where it can be seen as immobile. With the rpm of the weed eater you can also calculate the elongation of the string.<br>Basically with the phantom you&#39;ve built a visual tension-elongation measurement device.<br><br>Shear forces should apply in that case. You&#39;ve basically got 2 points of failure at least: 1 the impact weakens the plastic string. If the string isn&#39;t being broken by the impact, the smallest diameter of the plastic string no carries the weight of the weeed eater pull. After lowering the diameter, tension with a sheer force is being built up until the elastic deformation changes into a plastic deformation which leads to material failure.<br>Another potential weakening of the string lies in the fact that the string is curled up and therefore shows inner tensions. As we know, inner tensions do get released when heat is applied. This heat is created upon impact with the fence. Basically you use the impact of the string to straighten it out a little and release some of the material tension.<br>There are so many more things I have on my mind right now but due to me being German, it is hard to explain everything on my smartphone in a Youtube comment.<br><br>Greetings from a German mechanical (Diplom-) engineer in the field of material science, compound technology and damage analysis. <br><br>If you want a super interesting topic, I can hit you up with a machine that I&#39;ve built that replaces a multi-million dollar machine with something that can be self made for 50 bucks.

Because the more contact surface you get, the more weight gets dissipated over the surface and you ultimately get the same friction. No problem until here. But, when you think about cars and tyres, wide tyres with larger contact surfaces are considered to produce more friction which leads to higher cornering speed. Not only in the selection of tyres, but also in terms of suspension geometry settings (you must have realized by now that I\u2019m a very car obsessed guy), the settings that let the tyres have the most contact patch brings the most performance.

Very often sound will tell you a more in-depth picture and also for the audibly sensitive , sounds really cool at super slow Mo. Lastly, Ty for your great sharing of curiosity of the world and hopefully you will make a few more humans curious because that leads to less suffering. To be curious is to learn , to learn is to grow , to grow is to feel happy. P.s how did you miss in your practical yard whipping hours shorter spool length means greater speed !

It would be really cool to see how these different cutting heads chang the physics of the weedeater itself, the fence, and grass cutting!", "comment_date": "2020-05-31T19:22:30Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "RanDan", "comment_text": "<b><i>W E E D E A T E R</i></b>", "comment_date": "2020-05-31T19:22:29Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Zephr_", "comment_text": "I just bought one exactly when this video uploaded", "comment_date": "2020-05-31T19:22:26Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Tinker SailorHead", "comment_text": "For me the Slowed down Original Sound is the Most Amazing Thing in this Videos.", "comment_date": "2020-05-31T19:22:15Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Jason Knight", "comment_text": "@smarterEveryDay  - Hey Destin. I wanted to comment on something that takes you or your editor a lot of time and attention to detail but it&#39;s noticed and I appreciated. Thank you for taking the time to put all of the Foley sound in the video during the high speed slow downs. I love hearing these as I watch your shows in Dolby Digital 5.1 surround and the slow down sound really shakes my subwoofer and it&#39;s great. Sound is so important to a great video and you take the time to put this in your videos and I wanted you to know it&#39;s much appreciated although often unconsciously overlooked by the vast majority of your audience.  I really enjoyed the wetness of the grass sound as you sliced through it and I love that you caught the one in the background and pushed it a little further in the sound scape. This is first rate video making and I think it should be made public so others will appreciate the time and effort it takes to do this. You simply put some music over the high speed parts and no one would say a thing but you took the time to do it right and I think it should be applauded. Well done!! Thank you again for another fantastic video!", "comment_date": "2020-05-31T19:22:12Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Jack Mobley", "comment_text": "I love the creativeness of using an engine lift as a boom mount.", "comment_date": "2020-05-31T19:22:02Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "derick Deskins", "comment_text": "I bet the line heats up and thats what causes it to stretch and break so easily", "comment_date": "2020-05-31T19:21:59Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "J.P.

At the weld the horizontal lines resist that bending motion, therefore inducing more tension at those spots making it more likely to break. Also it depends who gives in first, the wire or the weld :)<br><br>That said the structure of the fence might play a huge roll.

What I really would have liked to see was a slow motion view of you destroying fire ant mounds and watching the fire ants being sliced and diced.  Fire ants are one insect that I have no mercy fore, they are the Devil Ants.  Just stand on a mound by accident and disturb the mound.  These sadistic variety of ants will crawl on your bare feet by the 1000\u2019s then at just the right moment send out a signal and BAM \ud83d\udca5 they ALL start to sting you at the exact same time<br><br>I want to see a slowmo of gasoline put on their mound then start the video as u poke a stick in the mound to disturb them and BAM  \ud83d\udca5 light the gas.  And no I\u2019m not related to Jeffery Dohmer, I just hate fire ants lol  I wish  you could record the fire ants screaming hahahahaha. For those of you who never had to deal with those buggers u r lucky.  Every sting leaves a pencil tip sized white puss sack that hurts for 24 hours and brother do  they itch! The instant you pop the sting site (pus sack) then it really stings.  Obviously I hate fire ants.<br><br>I would like to do what the Indians did back in the 1800\u2019s.  Take those Domestic Terrorists \u201c ANTIFE, smother them is a lite coating of honey, stake them next to a massive fire ant mound and disturb the mound.  Then tell them you will cut them loose when they give up their way of life and become peaceful productive American Citizens.  Obviously I equate ANTIFA in the same category as fire ants. Now remember I served 26 years in the Military.  We were taught many ways to deal with the bad guyZ lol.  I know I\u2019m not alone here, I am sick and tired of watching these ANTIFA Anarchists burning destroying and attacking the cops and the cops at this point aren\u2019t doing anything about it I wanna see the cup starts cracking skulls throwing these people to the ground hog tying them and throwing them in the back of trucks in Hauling them off to jail.

The force applied to the weed eater&#39;s head is a combination of of the pulling force created between where the line wraps around the stake and the point where the line attaches to the head, in conjunction with the leverage created by the rotation of the head pulling the head toward the stake, and the decreasing lateral leverage force as the head rotates 90 degrees from the line being straight forward to where the line is pointing left. There is another force applied to the head which would be angular deceleration of the line as it hits the stake, which would cause the line to want to rotate around it&#39;s central balance point in the opposite direction, like when you swing a bat and hit a ball, the ball make the bat&#39;s handle want to rotate in the opposite direction around the center of balance. All those forces combined would move the weed eater&#39;s head forward and right, but there is another force you may have forgotten about which is that you were not exerting equal resisting force to those forces because the head is on the end of a (approx) 4 foot shaft so it is easy for the head to be deflected left and right, but difficult for it to be deflected forward/backward due to the leverage of that shaft, so if you ran that test again without any shaft I&#39;ll bet the weed eater&#39;s head would move in a much more y-axis direction rather than an equal x and y axis movement as you showed here.", "comment_date": "2020-05-31T17:15:38Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Dan Drones", "comment_text": "Props to your team man, those slow mo sounds are high speed.", "comment_date": "2020-05-31T17:15:34Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Sparsh Desai", "comment_text": "Destin, Runnin The Slow Mo Guys outta business", "comment_date": "2020-05-31T17:15:33Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Ben Thomas", "comment_text": "Is that it\u2019s honest name?

It also depends on the trimmer line&#39;s dimensions. Is it the inexpensive round .06 or a higher end spiral or hexagonal or square .09 trimmer line?<br>When we weedeat we do expect a certain amount of resistance and will rev up the engine enough to trim the grass but not damage the tender tree trunk that it&#39;s butted up against. Because the disc isn&#39;t spinning fast enough to overcomes the resistance that the grass provides but ends will lag behind when it meets the trunk. Or wee need to rev it up to full power so it won&#39;t RIP the thick grass I&#39;m trying to cut. I also need to be aware of how much force I&#39;m applying to the rocks that some grass is growing through because I&#39;d rather not throw some errant pebble through my car window.
