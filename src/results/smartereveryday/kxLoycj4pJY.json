This is the verdict: Light has come into the world, but people loved darkness instead of light because their deeds were evil.

(romans 5:6-8) but if we deny and reject Him and don\u2019t repent from our sins to follow God, then we will have our part in the lake which burns with fire and brimstone, which is the second death. so hear these words, repent and believe the gospel! accept Jesus Christ and confess your sins to Him so that He will forgive you and give you a life with truth, love, joy, and peace. which will never fade away or perish.

I know I have Erhles Danlos Syndrome, so it will get in the way, but I do think I could take it. I mean, I can take multiple needles without flinching. And the only time I ever felt faint, wasn&#39;t even cause of the needle. It was my body reacting to the vaccination. I think it was for chicken pox or something, but I do remember taking two vaccines, and I almost fainted. Didn&#39;t faint in the end, but I almost head desk&#39;ed the reception desk :P.<br><br>So rule of advice; if you ever take a needle that isn&#39;t for the flu, wait a few minutes to see if there is any reaction. If there is, have the doctors just have you lay down on a bed for a good while. If you&#39;re fainting, you might as well do it where you can&#39;t fall.<br><br>Oh, and in regards to what tattoo I want, I want one like Hanzo from Overwatch. What? I like dragons. And I&#39;m right handed. If I can&#39;t use my left arm after I get the tattoo (theoretically, I think I could lose the use of my arm, due to my velvety skin. I strain could, because it might not even be likely anyway. But just in case), then that&#39;s fine.<br><br>Just a question though; does it help having fat on your arms when you get a tattoo? And is it a bad idea to get a tattoo on your arm if it is skinny? I&#39;m going to say yes, but I&#39;m looking more at &quot;would it bleed more if it was skinny?&quot;.", "comment_date": "2020-07-08T00:26:37Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "ThisIsMyUsername", "comment_text": "\u201cI can see why people get addicted\u201d yeah get angel wings on your back the first tattoo.

It&#39;s next door to nothing until the soreness sets in, and your skin is raw from the abuse... <br><br><br>    However, the more intense sensation will happen if you get into territory where there&#39;s little or no flesh between skin and bone, like your shins, ankles, knuckles, or elbows... There it&#39;s a little more like cutting in with a razor blade or similar...<br><br><br>    It&#39;s still not the most horrifying thing to feel. You CAN also take breaks when it gets too intense for you. The first step in tattooing is to establish the pattern on the skin for the line-work, so something similar to a plain sketch is applied. It will stay there until you actively engage in washing it off. Thus, the tattooist can work for a while, and sit back for a break and go back to work without losing any of the design, the features, details, etc. Some clients are known to even make multiple appointments just for shading and color. This also can be arranged to allow the tattooist to touch up older work in a piece while they&#39;re at the next level of details and effort. A full back piece that obviously has the kind of work to take a week isn&#39;t something some dude just walked in off the street and got while he was drunk... Most artists don&#39;t even service someone while they&#39;re drunk, and in some states it&#39;s illegal to do so. ;o)", "comment_date": "2020-03-30T04:01:13Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Brad Sullivan", "comment_text": "Those air quotes when he says \u201cartist\u201d are so disrespectful.

If a machine isn&#39;t used then the process is slow enough to not need any thing at all though. one method includes wrapping thread around the needle, with the thread holding ink and letting it run down to the tip(not super sanitary). although most methods of self tattooing are actually much less likely to get scary infections. Having a tattoo shop with a mcdonald&#39;s like approach to tattooing is ironically what makes for more infections. and dude! you got a huge darks spot on your arm! you know what it&#39;s gonna look like in even one decade?! maybe you should have done the tattoo yourself!!", "comment_date": "2016-05-24T16:23:03Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "badbabybear1", "comment_text": "Awesome to see this up close.

For those who don&#39;t know what an ink rubbing is, it&#39;s when you slice into your skin and then rub ink or some other pigment material into the wound. The initials came out really speckly and because I was drunk, the triforce isn&#39;t exactly even, but not very noticably so if you just glance at it. Plus the ink didn&#39;t take entirely, so only parts of the scar in the ink rubbing actually has black ink in it. I actually ran out of black ink during, so silly me, I decided to just go ahead and finish it off with blue ink instead doing the obvious and waiting until I could get some black ink.

If the presenter chooses not to get a tattoo is his own choice as much as it is to obtain one. The presenter is clearly interested in the science behind body art, passes no judgement and is respectful to the artists who are only too happy to show him how it is done.<br><br>The argument that one would regret a tattoo when they are elderly is null and void considering your skin gets damaged naturally be it by aging or sun damage. Your skin won\u2019t be as awesome when you are older when compared to when you are younger. And if one chooses to get cosmetic surgery to help reverse aging is their choice as well.<br><br>The only way to avoid regret in a tattoo is to do your research and keep in mind that if you buy cheap, you get cheap. For example, there are only three tattoo artists in the world that I will ever consider getting another tattoo from (Valerie Vargas in London, Rose Hardy in New York or Kat Abdy in Perth, they are amazing!) and they are not located anywhere near where I live. So I am happy to wait until I visit their cities or if they come to a body art exhibition to the capital city near my home.<br><br>You can appreciate body art or even heavy body modification, without any yourself. I&#39;m a massive supporter and appreciate Samppa Von Cyborg&#39;s and Steve Haworth&#39;s work. People get tattoos or body mods for a variety of reasons, be it to commemorate a loved one, to signify a particular event in ones life, or you just love the art. I only have one tattoo (no regrets, I still love it 10 years later), and I really appreciate the artistry and commitment of people who have modified their bodies to whatever they see fit.<br><br>So calm your llamas :)", "comment_date": "2014-10-04T08:47:31Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "UbuntuLive", "comment_text": "Why do people like tattoos?

My former high school assistant principal had two full sleeves, and was covered in tattoos. He has a B.A., a Masters, and a Doctorate, and he makes about $120,000 a year. I can count at least six teachers at my high school that have tattoos. I&#39;m currently enrolled in the highly competitive Undergraduate Business School at UConn. I was an AP student and member of the National Honor Society in high school. I&#39;ve held two part-time jobs, being promoted to manager in both, and I&#39;m currently in line to serve an internship with the government. Nearly a fourth of all Americans have a tattoo. Nearly half of my generation are tattooed. In case you haven&#39;t realized, it&#39;s not 1950 anymore.<br><br>2) Tattoos are not just for looks. Some tattoos are, of course. Some of mine are. But they ALL have a meaning, whether it&#39;s honoring my late grandmother or cousin, showing my pride (family crest, American flag), or signs of overcoming an autoimmune disease that almost killed me. People get tattoos after defeating cancer, to honor late relatives or friends, as a mark of pride (US soldiers, etc.).<br><br>3) Tattoos do not hurt as much as being stabbed. Certain people feel certain pain, and the spot matters as well. Some people can&#39;t bear it (which is fine) and some people hardly feel it. Certain spots hurt more, such as the collarbone, but in general, tattoos do not hurt as much as you&#39;d think. Take a butter knife, and drag it on your skin. It&#39;s a little irritating, but not very painful or unbearable. That&#39;s the typical amount of pain someone would feel when being tattooed, although it varies from person to person.<br><br>4) Tattoos are an art form. They&#39;re an expression.<br><br>5) You can indeed donate blood as long as the tattoo came from a reputable, licensed parlor. If not, you must wait 12 months. In a state that regulates tattoo licenses (which would be 40 states), you are fine to donate. I&#39;ve donate over a galloon of blood, and was a volunteer for the American Red Cross, earning a scholarship from them. Blood donations saved my life when I was in the hospital.<br><br>6) It&#39;s not your body. There&#39;s no need to attack people that enjoy tattoos. If you don&#39;t believe somebody should mark their body, don&#39;t mark yours. If you think getting a tattoo is dumb, don&#39;t get one. If you&#39;re afraid of getting a tattoo, don&#39;t tell others not to. Does somebody else having tattoos affect you in any way? No, not at all. Be tolerant, and respect others&#39; choices. Also try to keep an open mind, because tattoos aren&#39;t the end of the world.", "comment_date": "2014-09-29T01:17:09Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Arno Victor Dorian", "comment_text": "I&#39;d like to get one all over my right arm", "comment_date": "2014-09-29T00:54:01Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Michelle D'Angelo", "comment_text": "should I get a tattoo?", "comment_date": "2014-09-29T00:47:05Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "SoCloseToToast", "comment_text": "I think the only reason people are bashing tattoos saying &quot;white trash&quot; &quot;horrible&quot; &quot;wait till you get old&quot; blah blah is strictly because of society literally tattooing into people&#39;s brains that they are negative.

I am most annoyed when scripture is taken out of context or the meaning of it twisted to justify something such as it seems is the context in this case. so it seems to suggest that if one is &quot;led by the spirit&quot; then one is not under the &quot;law&quot;. if one is truly led by the spirit then what they are led to do is right. however, one must still must recognize if it is the spirit by which you are led. Remember that the evil one is a liar and a deceiver. Remember that the devil used scripture when he tempted Jesus, who then replied, &quot;it is written, you shall not put the Lord God to the test.&quot; The verse mentioned at the end of this video is not scriptural justification for someone who is a Christian to get a tattoo, not even one which is a religious theme. As for the book of leviticus specifically forbidding tattoos, there is in fact also new testament scripture which suggests that a tattoo is not acceptable Christian behavior. The scripture says that the body is a temple of the holy spirit and does not materially belong to the spirit who resides in it. This suggests that deliberately making such marks on it comparable to defacing someone else&#39;s property. The body is not born with such marks on it and should remain in that state...

(Though a reputable tattoo shop will keep things clean and sterile because of nasty things like STDs and such that are in human blood.\u00a0 And yes, because of how it works, it draws blood.) Possibility of getting diseases, having something you can&#39;t get rid of easily and getting a scar from it when you do get it gone, the sheer pain of it, the pain can be addictive, and it just ain&#39;t natural/in God&#39;s design. (I know the verse, but I have another verse, 1Corinthians <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kxLoycj4pJY&amp;t=6m19s\">6:19</a> states &quot;Or do you not know that your body is the temple of the Holy Spirit who is in you, whom you have from God, and you are not your own?&quot; I take it personally to mean not to do anything to your body that isn&#39;t natural or in His design, or could lead to reproach on His name.\u00a0 And most tattoos don&#39;t glorify His name, as Leviticus <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kxLoycj4pJY&amp;t=19m28s\">19:28</a> makes clear including them in what not to do with your body.\u00a0 Not that any Christians who get tattoos aren&#39;t saved, I tend to think of them as maybe not being very mature in Christ, or having a darn good excuse for it like this one lady who has the Law and Gospel tattooed in her arm as she&#39;s a driver who transports people and uses it to witness to them.\u00a0 (Though even she knows it&#39;s not a good idea for a Christian to get a tattoo in most cases.) And as you learned by having a &quot;dry&quot; test done on you, how people get addicted to it.\u00a0 And the Bible defines addictions as being anything that takes your focus off of God.\u00a0 It doesn&#39;t say that as I put it exactly, but if you&#39;ve read enough of it, you&#39;ll get the idea that&#39;s what it&#39;s talking about.\u00a0 Especially since it says to not be drunk, and in many cases, drunkards are examples of addicts in the scriptures.)", "comment_date": "2014-09-25T00:02:36Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Top7", "comment_text": "awesome video", "comment_date": "2014-09-24T23:55:56Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "touchly", "comment_text": "Awesome your videos always make me smile!", "comment_date": "2014-09-24T23:54:32Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Leios Labs", "comment_text": "And the comments are split!
