Drills were part of the process as the fire but their drill seemed minor compared to ours as everyone had to get up and get going.  It was all in getting breathing protection out(which by the way, certainly tests EVERY piece of equipment) and knowing where to be and what you were doing.

This is a simplification, but we are worried mostly about CO2 (we don\u2019t want it to get too high) and O2 (we don\u2019t want it to get too low).<br><br>For fire to burn, the oxygen percentage needs to be above about 16% (sea level is about 21% oxygen). On submarines, we have a huge incentive to make it difficult for fires to burn, so we wanted to keep oxygen percentage as low as possible.<br><br>However, what your lungs care about is the \u201cpartial pressure\u201d of oxygen. Partial pressure is the pressure attributable to the fraction of the gas in question, so it\u2019s a function both of percentage and pressure. You can actually suffocate breathing pure O2 if the pressure is low enough, like at high altitudes - this is what\u2019s so hard about climbing Everest - climbers can\u2019t get enough O2, even though they are breathing pure O2, because the total pressure and partial pressure of O2 is too low.<br><br>At sea level, where the atmospheric pressure is 760 mm of mercury, the \u201cpartial pressure\u201d of oxygen is 160mm of Hg (21% of 760). If I recall correctly, the atmosphere monitoring system on my submarine listed 140\u2013160 as the desired range for O2 partial pressure.<br><br>In order to reduce the <b>percentage</b> of O2 (to reduce risk of fire) but keep the partial pressure of O2 within the normal range, what we would do as Officer of the Deck (OOD) is to increase the pressure inside the sub by about 10%, while maintaining the partial pressure of O2 right at the lower limit. So, for example, if we were at 860 mmHg of total atmospheric pressure instead of 760mmHg, and at 140mmHg O2, the percentage of O2 would be only 16.3% - and it would be really hard to light cigarettes. Did the O2 partial pressure drop below 140, further reducing the O2 percentage so cigarettes wouldn\u2019t light? Occasionally? Sometimes it would liven up a boring midwatch to have an irate smoker storm up to the control room and complain about not being able to smoke.<br><br>Since I was in the Navy when smoking was allowed onboard, we tried to maintain a balance where a cigarette would burn, just not very well, to limit the risk of large fires. A good chunk of the crew couldn\u2019t totally wrap their head around the idea that they could still breathe even if a fire wouldn\u2019t burn, which created all kinds of psychosomatic symptoms that folks would complain about.", "comment_date": "2020-11-12T22:43:11Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Yossi in the simple kitchen", "comment_text": "First of all I really feel the need to thank you Justin for giving me the opportunity to see something that I as a simple and Israeli citizen would never see in life", "comment_date": "2020-11-12T20:44:55Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Renzsu", "comment_text": "I&#39;m loving this series, I&#39;m an industrial design engineer and it&#39;s part of my job to imagine all the correct and incorrect handling of a product I&#39;m designing (whether that&#39;s a stroller, a phone or whatever) and I just love seeing how everything (seemingly) has been thought of on a sub like this, from the efficient use of space to the indicators of the pressurized air and communication like the non-verbal communication.

I honestly love these deep dives as they provide me with a ton of nostalgia but more importantly, you give such a genuine reaction WRT how interesting these seemingly mundane topics can be when put in the context of being onboard a warship. I remember the first time I stepped aboard the USS George HW Bush...it was awe inspiring. I remember vividly the first time I felt the reverberations in my chest while witnessing a jet firing it&#39;s afterburner on the flight deck after being captured by arresting gear, so primal in it&#39;s savagery. The feeling of being launched in a COB(carrier onboard delivery plane) to ready shore power is one of the most viscerally exciting experiences I&#39;ve ever lived through. <br><br>But the things I remember most are the interactions with the crew and the seemingly meaningless day to day bits that define life aboard a warship. From the red lights during the evening, to the trips to the smoke deck during the day. Drills were a part of that, and while they are certainly not my favorite memories aboard the ship, they&#39;re present nonetheless and you&#39;ve done a good job of capturing just how interesting they can be from an outsider&#39;s perspective.<br><br>Edit: Fun fact for anyone watching. The thing on the senior chief&#39;s(Matt Charlton&#39;s) belt is called a TLD or Thermo luminescent Dosimeter. It&#39;s the device that the navy uses to track exposure to nuclear radiation for those that work in the reactor division aboard a ship. He is the leading enlisted member of the reactor controls division(RC Div) aboard the submarine and is an E8, or senior chief, the second highest rank among enlisted personnel in the USN. RC div is the division that actually mans the reactor control panel on a submarine. They control the nuclear reactor that powers the ship. You go through at least 1 and a 1/2 years of training to become a nuclear operator aboard a navy vessel, more if you&#39;re aboard a submarine, not including boot camp.", "comment_date": "2020-10-23T07:19:10Z", "likes_count": 53}, {"comment_by": "Astro 0", "comment_text": "I really liked this video, one of the best.", "comment_date": "2020-10-23T02:42:51Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Patrick Hurley", "comment_text": "I wonder how they deal with covid testing.

The way the firefighting team operates (that the one with the thermal imageing camera taps the hose operator on the shoulder to signal where he should spray) is actually not a really good idea.

When you\u00b4re extinguishing a fire in front of you, the outermost layer will be extremely hot. If now someone comes along and taps you on the shoulder, the air will be displaced and all the different layers touch each other. The result is that the insulating effect will be lost and you will get a big burnmark in the form of a hand on your shoulder.
