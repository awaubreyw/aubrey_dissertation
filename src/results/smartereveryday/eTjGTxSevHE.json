The wheel is spinning clockwise when viewed from the top. For ease of explanation, imagine a clock face superimposed on the wheel so that 12 o&#39;clock is the most distant point of the wheel and 6 o&#39;clock is closest to the guy&#39;s chin. <br>  Now suppose a point on the wheel is passing through the 6 o&#39;clock position. The guy pushes upward on the lever. This tends to make the point on the wheel move straight up. However, because the wheel is spinning, the point does not move straight up - it sort of goes on an incline, up and to the left. It will continue up this incline until it reaches a maximum Up at the 9 o&#39;clock position.  At this point, the force applied by spokes tends to win out and the point begins to move downward and to the right, on a downward incline. <br>  It will continue on this downward incline until it reaches the 9 o&#39;clock position where the spokes again win out and starts the point moving upward again.  So what do we have? Maximum Up occurs at 9 o&#39;clock. Maximum Down occurs at 3 o&#39;clock. The only way this can happen is for the plane of the wheel to tilt to the right, as you can observe in the video.<br>  For fun, suppose the wheel was rotating in the opposite direction. Push the lever up as before. Now the point (at 6 o&#39;clock) will begin to travel on an upward incline to the right. Where will it reach the maximum Up? And, of course, the plane of the wheel will tilt to the left. <br>   What if the wheel were not rotating at all? In this case, the point would simply move straight up without traveling on an incline, and there would be no precession. <br>   Not so hard after all, is it?   :)        (10/2020)", "comment_date": "2020-10-18T16:29:36Z", "likes_count": 2}, {"comment_by": "cowsauce", "comment_text": "I get that it does this but no idea why", "comment_date": "2020-09-27T03:01:47Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Calder Wishne", "comment_text": "It\u2019s funny how much gyroscopes challenge our preconceptions.

The reason is easy to visualise when the solid wheel is replaced with a wheel of flexible blades with weights on the ends.  It&#39;s difficult to describe in words, but really easy to see.  Surprisingly, I can&#39;t find a YouTube video of it.  I saw it once in one of the Christmas lectures on TV - and immediately grasped how gyroscopic precession works.<br>Basically, it&#39;s Newton&#39;s first law - every object will remain at rest or in uniform motion in a straight line unless compelled to change its state by the action of an external force.  Thinking of the flexible blades model, the blades fly around in what we will call the reference disc.  When the hub is rocked towards you, there is a tendency to rock the plane of the blades towards you also, with the lowest part of the disc closest to you - but it doesn&#39;t happen immediately.  The blade at 3-o-clock would go to 6-0-clock (in the reference plane) unless acted on by a force - but there <i>is</i> a force - the hub has been rocked downwards.  However, the blade doesn&#39;t feel that force at all when it is at 3-o-clock - it feels it at a maximum when it is at 6-o-clock, and starts to move downwards below the reference plane.  As it proceeds towards the 9-o-clock position, it continues to move downward, but at 9-o-clock, it feels a force moving it up above the reference disc.  It starts to move up at that point, so its momentum is moving from &#39;going down&#39; to &#39;gpoing up&#39;.  You can see that its maximum &quot;down&quot; point is at 9-o-clock, although you rocked the disc towards you, so the lowest point should be 6-o-clock.  When the blades are at their lowest point (9-o-clock) they will exert the maximum force on the hub - and that&#39;s why the maximum force is at 90-degrees to the angle of rocking.<br>It just goes to show - gyroscopes rock - man!", "comment_date": "2019-10-17T11:45:49Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "\u00d8roiq", "comment_text": "I bet the first heli crashed because they tried to tilt the blades 90 degrees off.", "comment_date": "2019-10-16T11:20:24Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Alex Waltman", "comment_text": "Problem with this video is...

As that point spins to the opposite side of the disk, it counteracts itself exactly 180 degrees out. IE: The &quot;same&quot; amount of force is applied to both sides of the axle/fulcrum causing zero angular force. However, assuming the initial force was downward, at 90 degrees from the initial force there would be residual downward inertia, while ate 270 degrees the residual inertia from the opposite side would be upward because the original force, applied against the disc and against the fulcrum/axle caused upward inertia on the opposite side. In other words, the inertia at 0 and 180 degrees cancel each other out while the inertia at 90 and 270 degrees is complimentary.

Thus the blade at the 3 o&#39;clock position has the highest blade pitch input because we need the blade to be lifted up to a higher tip path to generate the forward facing life force when it becomes at the 6 o&#39;clock position.<br>A2) knowing that i need to provide a mechanical input force to the blade pitch change point/axis and knowing that true gyroscopic precession exists with this large rotating mass i need to apply that &#39;up force&#39; to the pitch change control rod (swash-plate to pitch horn on the blade grip) when the blade is 90 deg before the required up force. thus i push up on the control rod at the 3 o&#39;clock position.<br><br>NETT RESULT<br>to fly forward i use an aerodynamic &#39;gyroscopic&#39; effect coupled with the try gyroscopic effect of the rotating mass of the blades and the disk.  <br><br>NOTE; the term aerodynamic gyroscopic effect has nothing to do with the mass of the object rather a out of phase delay that happens.", "comment_date": "2019-01-24T22:27:35Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Jake O'Donnell", "comment_text": "This is very late for when the video was uploaded, but this makes sense.

I disagree with this. <br>Gyroscopic procession is what you get when you try to tilt a rotating disk by applying tilting force to the rotating axis. Helicopters work backwards to this.

The only thing the swash plate does is change the pitch of the blades. This part is the important part....The blades are wings and follow the pitch angle. Tilt them up, and they rise, tilt them down, and they sink. <br>To make the back of the disk go up, (forward movement) you tilt the swash plate forward. This changes the pitch of the blade at 90 degrees.... Actually it changes it not just at the 90 deg position, but around the entire rotation of the blades. It is just most visible at the 90 degree position. The pitch is flat at the front and back because the blade has lifted as high as its going to go and needs to immediately start flying down to be low at the front.<br><br>The idea you have to wrap your brain around, is the disk is tilting itself.    Zero  force is being applied to the gyroscopic disks axle, therefore, no gyroscopic procession.<br><br>However, There can be gyroscopic procession that happens in a helicopter. If an outside force tries to tilt the rotor by means of tilting the whole helicopter, for example, say someone lifts the tail upward. at this point, the shaft is tilting forward and trying to tilt the disk, and THAT induces Gyroscopic procession. A common occurrence of this is when wind starts to push a helicopter sideways when landing.  The helicopter can slide sideways along the ground until the skids grip the ground or worse if the hit something that stops them from sliding.
