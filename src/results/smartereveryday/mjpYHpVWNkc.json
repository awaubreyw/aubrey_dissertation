I\u2019ve been watching your videos since your start on YouTube, and feel kinda special for being here for the whole journey between older model high speed cameras, to interviewing the president, into the present. You inspire me, remind me of my grandfather who was a great engineer/inventor, obsessed with precision and mechanics. I don\u2019t know if you\u2019ll ever see this comment, but just wanted to say how awesome your gifts of knowledge and curiosity have been over the years. I re-watch your videos often, and usually catch something I missed previously, making me smarter EVERY day :) you rock man. I feel like you\u2019re a friend who helps me grow and be a better, educated &amp; aware human. \ud83d\ude4f\ud83c\udffc cheers from CT.
