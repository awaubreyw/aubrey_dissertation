That&#39;s EXTREMELY SIMILAR to how Adobe Flash/Animate actually render the individual lines that are drawn with the brush.<br>Back in the Flash 8 days, I imagine that the way Flash would render brush strokes would be taking the raw pixel data and try to recreate the curves using the fourier series in a similar way to how Doga drew the Smarter Every Day logo. Flash has the same type of behavior when you attempt to draw a really long stroke with lots of curves in it.<br>Adobe changed Flash to Animate, and upgraded the brush so now it follows your input really closely with a ton of accuracy. I&#39;ve noticed a significant change, and now that the lines have become extremely smooth, the actual time taken to render each stroke is quite long. That might mean that they&#39;re calculating the stroke with a ton of harmonics so that the strokes get REALLY SMOOTH, but now becomes more demanding on performance.", "comment_date": "2021-01-25T19:00:15Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "chilukoti pranathi", "comment_text": "Please make a video on Fourier transform also.<br>This was an amazing software for an intuitive visualisation", "comment_date": "2021-01-25T04:17:00Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "JOHN TUOHY", "comment_text": "What was the final fourier series for the face?", "comment_date": "2021-01-22T12:20:03Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "\u05e2\u05d3\u05df \u05de\u05d6\u05d5\u05e8", "comment_text": "wat", "comment_date": "2021-01-21T10:56:13Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Gamer From Space", "comment_text": "Just an engineering student here trying to find meaning  of Fourier seried", "comment_date": "2021-01-19T01:38:42Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Marco Kropp", "comment_text": "GREAT EPISODE!!! \ud83d\udc4d \ud83d\udc4d \ud83d\udc4d", "comment_date": "2021-01-19T00:27:13Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "John Doe", "comment_text": "It\u2019s so satisfying in a hard class to really understand a topic", "comment_date": "2021-01-16T22:14:18Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "TheIVPope", "comment_text": "Doga&#39;s face when you said jif had me in tears", "comment_date": "2021-01-15T16:55:15Z", "likes_count": 12}, {"comment_by": "Jonnyreverb", "comment_text": "It&#39;s not jif.

Therefore, we were required to make a 1st + 3rd + 5th harmonic approximation of a square wave using free running sine signal generators stacked on top of each other with a signal combining network output to an oscilloscope.  It was maddening to hold them stable enough at low frequencies so we could take a picture for the lab report.  <br><br>Fourier series has some limitations representing impulses but can be extended using the integral form (infinite number of frequencies in any interval which is more useful than it sounds) and windowing...multiplying the function to be approximated by a function &#39;window&#39; like an exponential before doing Fourier analysis.  I don&#39;t think there are many instructors who can seat the concept firmly in a students mind so that, for example, the student is not flabbergasted to find LaPlace transforms can solve physical system time behavior but also reveal the frequency response at the same time.

There was  an adage coined at the time &quot; three makes chaos &quot;.  It refers to a system in which a second pendulum is added to a simple pendulum, then a third pendulum is added to the second.  If a two pendulum system is driven at constant speed the second pendulum will behave in a harmonic manner.  If however a three P system is driven at constant speed the behaviour of the system will become chaotic.  Science novelty stores used to sell nifty models reproducing this effect.<br>Applying a thought experiment to the graphic simulations can we imagine that they would show chaos as in a real dynamic system ?  If no chaos is observed then why not ?  Conversely we can ponder the question why in the real world do systems descend into chaos very soon ?<br>Another thought experiment : can an individual in the act of drawing a continuous line but with a shaky hand be said to drawing an analogue of a Fourier system ?", "comment_date": "2020-10-24T23:14:41Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Manny Khan", "comment_text": "Dogas a bit cocky for a mathematician", "comment_date": "2020-10-24T03:46:05Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "\u738b\u932b\u4e5d", "comment_text": "Smart n cool guys", "comment_date": "2020-10-22T06:58:04Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Black Clover", "comment_text": "look what i learned today, anti-aliasing in games is just Fourier series expansion lol", "comment_date": "2020-10-21T21:58:24Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Udo Matthias drums", "comment_text": "love it!!", "comment_date": "2020-10-21T05:47:01Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "SykkeX", "comment_text": "Hello, do you know some good app for fourier series and fourier transform for Android?", "comment_date": "2020-10-19T06:43:47Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Dinamy", "comment_text": "No, it&#39;s not jif.

So most everyday functions can be represented via Fourier series, but if the function is not square integrable, the traditional Fourier series will not always converge.

So this is false in two ways.  <br>It depends what you mean by &quot;approximate any other function&quot;.  For example You can&#39;t approximate a &quot;square-wave&quot; uniformly by adding sine waves and this is because the former is discontinuous, whereas the latter is not, and since the space of continuous functions from [-\u03c0,\u03c0] to R is complete with this metric.   (So basically you&#39;ll always miss out on those edges).  However, the up-shot, is that this works when you quantify approximation by meaning (on averge the varriance of the approximation errors, integrated over [-\u03c0,\u03c0] goes to 0) .  This is latter statement is true since (in linear-algebra-esque terms:) &quot;sine ways form a basis of L^2&quot;.<br>Second point:  It depends what you mean by approximate &quot;any function&quot;.  For example, a non Borel-measurable function clearly cannot be approximated by fourier series.  <br>General comment:  Btw, he&#39;s not adding sine waves, he&#39;s shifting, scaling, and adding them.

E.g. the step function approximation (<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ds0cmAV-Yek&amp;t=2m35s\">2:35</a>) will always have an intermediary point (either at 0.5 if the graph ranges from 0 to 1, 0 if from -1 to 1 etc.) C: The function must have a derivative everywhere.

It just seemed like a simple polar projection onto the Cartesian plane. But then, I sort of realized the point here, which is why I think it would have also been interesting to hear explained the conceptual implications behind the visualization in this video.<br><br>I&#39;d like to take a crack at explaining. I&#39;m only about 90% sure about this (for the love of god, correct me if I&#39;m wrong), but this is my understanding: the Fourier series is comprised of a series of sine waves that add up to the periodic function under analysis. Each iteration (each sine wave) has a frequency that is n times a certain fundamental frequency (don&#39;t worry about what the fundamental frequency is; different fundamentals just result in scalar multiples of the function under analysis) and an amplitude that is determinable using the Fourier transform.<br><br>Now, the left-hand side of the visualization shows attached lines spinning. The big line in the middle is the first iteration of the Fourier series. The smaller line attached to that is the second iteration, and so on. Each line corresponds to one iteration of the Fourier series. Each line rotates at the same frequency of its respective sine wave, and each line has a length equal to the amplitude of its respective sine wave. At the end of the last line segment, a trace is drawn, in light blue. This trace is the polar representation of the function under analysis being approximated by the Fourier series. Then, it is projected onto the Cartesian plane, and this is the Fourier approximation of the function.<br><br>What I think is much more difficult to visualize is the relation between time domain and frequency domain (bode plots are in frequency domain). While this video was very cool, helpful, and educational, I think I personally yearn for a more visual and concrete understanding of how frequency domain can be visualized just by looking at a time domain function.<br><br>Overall, great video! It got me thinking, which means it served its purpose.

Sine and Cosine, each consist of the summation or the subtraction of two three dimensional rotation in opposite directions. If one makes it clear that the flat pulsating sine and cosine are only the projection of a three-dimensional function, life for students engineers would be so much simpler.<br>One should learn to visualize in three dimension  e^( r+jwt) - e^rt*( cos( wt) + j.sin(wt)  and the opposite rotation e^ rt *( cos( wt) -j.sin(wt) and one can see many beautiful images being created when handling Fourier, Laplace, Convolution Integrals and how filters operate with their impulse function operating on a kernel operating on an input signal. All this can be seen in three dimensions.  Beautiful work indeed. <br>When I was very young I did see all this and I am sure that Fourier and Laplace did mean to explain that all their work was meant to be understood as three-dimensional work............I believe what happened was that their audience did not understand what Fourier and Laplace really meant by their operators, and so the audience went around the world and they preached what they did not fully understand! Pity, such pity books are written describing sine and cosine as flat functions when their origin is from three-dimensional operations using  three-dimensional  rotating ( helical) functions", "comment_date": "2019-01-31T00:10:30Z", "likes_count": 25}, {"comment_by": "Vesta Arcadia", "comment_text": "Pretty pissed you interrupted him just as he was about to show you a gif of the mandelbrot set.", "comment_date": "2019-01-29T22:54:56Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Alex T", "comment_text": "Why does the American have to be the lunkhead?", "comment_date": "2019-01-29T20:54:05Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Jeff Vader", "comment_text": "I have a nephew (only a few months old) and I am totally buying him a Kiwico when he get&#39;s older.", "comment_date": "2019-01-29T20:43:12Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "cosa grande", "comment_text": "Nice video, but only using one side of each page in your notes hurt me", "comment_date": "2019-01-29T17:49:58Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Aleron Zacchaeus", "comment_text": "OMG Guys.

But for me through math and accurate data (scanned 3d object) we can make a 3d into 2d. Actually we can make 2D object printed in 3d printers right? why not in reverse? make 3d island into 2d and through accurate GPS data collectively mapping it into 2d map. I will glad if you can cover this into one of your videos. And if this is possible,  i think this is one of the solution that will end into the flat earth controversy. if they don&#39;t trust &quot;other&quot; scientific evidence, maybe they can trust this &quot;Mathematical Evidence&quot;.

In Math/Engineering terms, giving this transformation, any signal, it can break it down into its frequency components.

The function/graph I get out (Called a Power Spectral Density Function), shows me the main frequencies that were played. Obviously, some stick out more than others.

Here&#39;s a link to the batman equation explanation I saw: <a href=\"https://youtu.be/0shhLd_JrhA\">https://youtu.be/0shhLd_JrhA</a> <br><br>Is the batman thing similar to the fourier thing, but batman uses y=x and y=x^2 sorta stuff (algebra-based) and fourier uses trig based stuff like waves?<br><br>I&#39;m sure there&#39;s probably a way to combine the two techniques for approximating shapes using equations, but going beyond that is there a way to write a program to determine where to use which technique for a given graph. like i feed the program a square and it goes oh this is a square I should use batman technique for straight lines, not fourier or something. <br><br>Would that relate to the separate question I have right now in math class? Will I ever learn the answers to either of these questions? What knowledge do I lack to figure out the answer to these questions?<br><br>Also, a side thing i want to note is that the batman technique feels like coding to me because when I was going through the hand-drawn graphics unit for computer programming (java) we made circles to approximate curves then layered other shapes on top to hide the parts we didn&#39;t need. Whereas the fourier thing seems like physics where waves cancel out other waves and stuff and I was left like whoa if I have a given wave how do I figure out what other waves to layer to turn it into any other wave I want? Is there an equation for that and can I program a computer to do that? until now I didn&#39;t know the answer to that question I asked two years ago in physics class, but now I know you do a fourier transform and boom you&#39;ve changed your wave. <br><br>Also, I really like the circle visualization of the fourier stuff.

Isn&#39;t Doga&#39;s program a great visual aid for teaching people about deferents and epicycles?<br><br>For those who don&#39;t know, the stacked smaller cycles that Doga showed are the &quot;deferent and epicycle&quot; model in astronomy, the building block of the planetary motion model from Ancient Greece until the Scientific Revolution gave us ellipses. The astronomers over those many centuries used just a few stacked circle layers (the largest one called a deferent and the rest called epicycles) to predict the elliptical planetary motions to within their limits of (eyeball) observation. As you can imagine after seeing Doga&#39;s initial square wave demonstration, they did pretty well! Epicycles could even explain the apparent retrograde motion that astronomers saw in other planets, which gave them that <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23mathswagger\">#mathswagger</a> if anything did. And circles fit well with the philosophy of the Greeks and later the monotheistic religions that that circles are perfect, and the Heavens are perfect, and look the Heavens run on circles, so Q.E.D.<br><br>Later in this video, Doga went even further and showed that with many epicycles, you can draw some pretty arbitrary shapes. Assuming you have computing power or Fourier math, that is! Not shown here, but with infinitely many epicycles you can truly draw any shape.<br><br>But Copernicus lived hundreds of years before computers and Fourier. This became an issue when Copernicus objected to one of Ptolemy&#39;s innovations, the equant, which Copernicus felt to be a departure from Aristotelean cycles and epicycles. To solve this aesthetic problem, Copernicus traded the equant for more epicycles, which rapidly became computationally prohibitive. He sat down and reformulated it from the ground up, and became convinced that the Sun had to be the center that everything else orbited around - not only did it make the math easier and more elegant than his first try, but it predicted physical properties like the ordering of the planets. <br><br>It&#39;s even more impressive because the crucial experiments proving that Copernicus was on the right track were only possible to conduct with Galileo&#39;s telescope, several generations later.<br><br><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deferent_and_epicycle\">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deferent_and_epicycle</a>", "comment_date": "2018-12-11T02:22:29Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "D irk3672", "comment_text": "Check out 2-D Digitial Fourier analysis.

The standard Fourier series uses sine and cosine waves, but in general, we can use much weirder functions with desirable properties. For example, in the case of a Sturm-Liouville problem, we are able to solve a family of simple differential equations, then combine those solutions in a series to solve a more complicated one. Power series let us decompose a function into something resembling a polynomial, Dirichlet series let us decompose it into something with number theoretic uses, Fourier series let us decompose it into &quot;signals,&quot; and orthogonal series representations are the next step of abstraction of this idea.", "comment_date": "2018-12-10T23:27:39Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "kaplumbaga efendisi", "comment_text": "&quot;Bilim ne g\u00fczel lan!&quot; ahahaaaa, Fuyye serisi. g\u00f6\u011fs\u00fcm\u00fcz kabard\u0131 topra\u011fam, Allah yolunu a\u00e7\u0131k etsin.", "comment_date": "2018-12-10T23:27:37Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Can Kayabek", "comment_text": "(about gif thing) when i was young i used to think every language thought they were read how they were written, as a turkish person, but then i realised turkish was kinda better about it, only contradiction that i can think of right now is e and \u00e6 (like elma(apple) is elma and kel(bald) is k\u00e6l) why am i telling this = drunk", "comment_date": "2018-12-10T23:24:48Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "TomHolmez12", "comment_text": "just did fourier series last month, this really helps my understanding cheers", "comment_date": "2018-12-10T23:24:48Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Dani", "comment_text": "ZHAIF", "comment_date": "2018-12-10T23:23:17Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Eldred", "comment_text": "At least it&#39;s not Better Help, or Candid lmao.", "comment_date": "2018-12-10T23:23:10Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Michael Lloyd", "comment_text": "Wow.
