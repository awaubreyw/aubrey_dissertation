Then they (Polaroid)sued Kodak after they had a falling out. While they were in court we continued to make the support layers for them because they couldn\u2019t make enough support for instant film demand. Boy I could tell you some stories. Kodak was the greatest film company in the world and we truly were a family. Kodak had bowling lanes, six baseball fields and several indoor and outdoor basketball courts. A shooting range, with instructors. All at Kodak Park for the employees. We had three fully equipped fire departments and 4 ambulances and a 50 bed hospital with surgery rooms.

The story in the middle was of a chemical company that invented a number of amazing technologies (some of which are only being perfected now, like acetylated wood), and others which changed history.  One of the major limitations of depth charges early in the battle of the Atlantic was that the UBoats were built to withstand TNT laden depth charges, significantly limiting their effect.  The RN had known about this for some time, and developed RDX as a more energetic explosive for this exact purpose.  The issue was that in a plant, a batch process is almost never economical, much less practical for making a high volume, consumable good for industrial warfare.  The UK reached out to the US for help with manufacturing, and shared the recipe for synthesizing RDX, but it remained a batch process.  Eastman developed the Bachmann process, which turned RDX production from a time and capital inefficient batch process into a highly efficient continuous process.  The critical need for higher volumes of RDX in the context of the Battle of the Atlantic meant that Eastman&#39;s contribution, among others, was critical in keeping Britain supplied via sea and thus in the war.<br><br>Eastman Chemical is still a world class specialty chemical producer.", "comment_date": "2022-04-26T22:17:56Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Taco Crisma", "comment_text": "Destin, glad you were able to highlight this.

As a  photographer, I had to learn all the processes with the film 35mm black and white (B&amp;W) and color film. For newspaper prints, we need pictures with lots of grain.  That is where the ISO number on the film determines the sensitivity of the film other issues with the cameras as well are that I can&#39;t use them.  I had to develop my own film after shooting pictures.  In B&amp;W the larger the ISO number the grainier the picture and the more light-sensitive the film is. To develop the film you need a total black-out room or box to transfer the film from the canister to the coil that goes in a large can with a cap that only allows the developing liquid in but not light. Three steps to develop the film, DEVELOPER, STOP BATH, and then the FIXER was the silver in the film is removed to preserve the image. Then you wash the film with clean water and hang it in a non-dust area, I used to use a tall locker to hang and dry my film. Then I cut the film by about 6 frames for storage and easy to make the pictures in the red light or orange lightroom. I also extracted silver from the FIXER acid using aluminum oxide powder.  In a large bucket the FIXER solution after a month of use, mix the aluminum oxide powder and let stan mix well a few times, After a few days using a coffee filter I filtered the silver powder after the aluminum oxide powder turned into silver powder.

Greens that weren&#39;t green, skies that weren&#39;t blue, and so forth.  And then there were the occlusions.  I had some of those in my Tri-X film that I used to shoot high school sports in the 80s.  You can&#39;t fix an occlusion if it happens to be right on somebody&#39;s face in your photo.  And it never really got better.  Finally in the late 90s/early 00s, I switched to a Sony digital, then to an Olympus, and after that to a Nikon digital SLR.  Now I shoot most everything on my iPhone but I still have the Nikon and some nice lenses.  I won&#39;t go back to film, not even for the nostalgia of it all.  Digital is where the power is.

These came in handy during Desert Shield/Desert Storm.  Saved a lot of time and manpower.<br><br>Love the way you described the accumulator you were fascinated with. On our film processing machines we could run them 24/7 as long as we had film and chemistry due to accumulator at both the feed and take-up ends of the processor. Except that after a few miles of film the machine had to be cleaned and checked for defects.  We only had about 30-45 seconds on either end to make a splice in the film or put on a new take-up roll before the accumulator would crash. When that happened all heck would break lose with buzzers and such.

By switching the air flow between rollers, the tape could suddenly reverse direction, or stop, too.  (This was useful when needing to reread a block of tape or to read after write, perhaps .) The vacuum columns, like the accumulator, allow for all this to happen awfully quickly while the electric motor driving the heavy tape reel reacted more slowly.

In order for the film to stretch uniformly, it needs to resist stretching more as it thins.  If it didn&#39;t, it would stretch nonuniformly.  When softening something by heat &amp; stretching, if the heat is applied AS the stretch is done (film is cooler than the air, so being heated by the air surrounding it), the thinner parts of the film will heat faster &amp; soften &amp; stretch more, accenting the nonuniformity, usually to the point of bursting.  The dirty trick is to heat the film first (while NOT stretching), then surrounding it with cooler air while it is stretched.  The thinner parts cool more, so resist stretching, leading to a uniform film thickness.<br>          This is a trick learned by glassblowers.

Webb apparently realized the implications of such results in 1945, and did not publish his findings until 1949.

I was a tech in a factory making these (not ABB.) I handled hundreds of these beta sources in my 10 year career. They are safe, as long as they are handled correctly, or not handled at all. Keeping such a source with an open shutter against your body would give you a &quot;beta burn,&quot; but it would take a while, as these are under a curie in strength. If the source of radiation is xenon-85 gas, they have no ability to leak -- they are either sealed capsules or empty.

So I had two summer jobs there as I was enrolled in the Fine Arts department Film program at York University. I was a night cleaner for one year (and learned about the VERY strict rules we had to follow if by accident we broke a fluorescent bulb, as the contents of the bulb could ruin entire batches of film emulsion, regardless of what building you were in). The second year I got to be assistant to the company photographer in the Communication Department and got to work along side the folks in the Marketing Education Center. It was such a great place to work! All THE BEST darkroom equipment - it was great. I even borrowed an 8x10 camera (yes, 8 by 10 inches for ONE image) one weekend and took some snaps around Port Credit Ontario where I lived. The 8x10 enlarger wasn\u2019t set up, so I could only make prints via a contact sheet. So I still got 8x10 pictures out of it! <br><br>Thanks Destin! Great video, so looking forward to the next two!

Especially with Leica prices, and I have lots of those!  I had a thought when digital forced the demise of film, that 35mm could make a revival, it being similar to when digital watches almost killed real watches, now of course, mechanical watches are now a multi million industry at all price levels.

I work at a steel mill in Arkansas and we make sheet steel that is coiled up similarly. Although we are talking completely different products there are similar concepts. We take in scrap steel and melt 100k tons in an electric arc furnace or EAF. From there the furnace is tapped and poured off into ladles where the heats are customized to customer specs by adding alloys. Next step is to send heats to our strand casters. Essentially the ladles of molten steel are placed onto a turret the turret can hold 2 ladles and rotate over top of a tundish. The tundish is the transition to the caster mold. The mold is where steel is formed. The tundish acts as an &quot;accumulator&quot;. It holds enough molten steel to allow time for turret to rotate the second ladle in place. Once in the mold material gravity feeds out the bottom to form a slab. The edges of the mold are adjustable to change width of product. We vary width based on custom but we run 65mm slabs up to 65&quot; wide up to 2000&quot; in length. As the slabs come out the bottom of the mold the are sprayed with water to help form and thicken the outer shell as the inside is very much liquid. The slab also runs through driven rollers that squeeze on slab. Material thickness stays the same in this part of process. As material feeds down the slab is slowly pushed and transitions from a vertical direction to a horizontal using guide rollers. Once horizontal it passes through a shear and is cut to a predetermined length again based on what the customer order. At this point the slab enters a linear furnace that actually adds heat to the bar to give it a more uniform heat throughout the bar. Usually slabs come from Caster at roughly 1700f and we heat them back up to about 2000 but this varies widely depending on what we are running. We have about 70 or 80 different grades we run and all have different metallurgical properties and have to be ran differently. The next major step is the rolling mill. At the rolling mill we roll the strip out to its final thickness and again its based on customer specs, but we can run as low as .060 gauge. We have 6 roll mill stands that squeeze and pull the slab to maintain width we pull as we squeeze. The motors for these stands are roughly 10k HP. In between each mill stand are what we call loopers. The loopers acts as accumulators and gives us excess material between stand by adding tension to the strip. They apply tension by raising a roll up into the strip this roll uses a hydraulic cylinder we maintain many tons of force at a specific angle. Any variations in the slab will effect the amount of material between stands. If the looper weren&#39;t there the slap would rip under tension or there could be too much slack and the strip will sag to the floor.  As the angle of the looper increases which would mean too much material the control system will start to speed up the stand in front or slow the previous stand down. All stands are connect by the strip and therefore any changes made to one will cascade to the other stands. There is so much more to what it takes to roll the slab out, but id never get it all in here. Anyways as the strip travels through final mill stand it will be at its final thickness. We also have an Xray gauge used to measure strip thickness if it&#39;s off the control system will make automatic corrections. The strip heads down the run out table which is a series of rolls and we have above them laminar headers which use laminar flow to cool the strip. There&#39;s much automation to this because each grade has to be cooled at a certain rate to a final temp. After passing through the ROT the strip finally heads to the coiler which is a big mandrel which secondary rolls that guide the head to the mandrel and the strip is coiled up. Our coils weigh anywhere from 35tons to 70 tons each. Pretty awesome process. I love it and I love watching other processes and see the similarities.

I grew up before digital, so film cameras to me aren&#39;t magic, they&#39;re still the old thing that I&#39;m glad to be living in the &quot;future&quot; of. I remember the quirks of it, and the limitations of it. And, honestly, I don&#39;t like the tone of film. I know people are starting to enjoy that tone, but to me it looks washed out and less interesting.<br><br>That said, I do see value in keeping it alive. I learned things about composition with black and white film cameras that I don&#39;t know how I would learn them with a digital camera, and it&#39;s carried over into my digital photography today. Dad was one of those &quot;amateur&quot; photographers that bordered on professional, even teaching classes at the local trade school for a while, and he was very big on teaching us how cameras worked at all levels.<br><br>The main reasons I am fully in on digital right now are - <br>1. The richness of the color I can get out of digital. I know, in theory, how to burn and dodge film to get that richness, but I have never touched the tools required to do that in color and I only once developed my own black and white film. I don&#39;t feel that&#39;s what this modern fascination with film is doing either, it feels more like a return to the photography I did as a child where processing was handled entirely by companies like the one you toured in the previous video. I&#39;d love to see development art make a comeback too - honestly I feel there is as much art to be done in development as in composition of a photograph. I know more about how to do it digitally and I&#39;ve been able to enhance some of my photos in ways that amaze me with just dodge and burn.<br>2. It&#39;s not always intentional. I know people harp on how important it is to &quot;be intentional&quot; with important things, but there is also value in not being intentional. A lot of the best photography for an amateur is taking a moment in your life that you&#39;re just living, and capturing something that strikes you. A flowerpot while walking downtown, a view of a historic building through the trees while walking a trail, or just a unique point of view looking out from where I happened to sit down. You can&#39;t practically carry a film camera (or a professional digital camera) everywhere on the off chance of one of those moments, but with digital, and specifically the quality of modern cell phones, I can capture a photo now that would have required my father&#39;s SLR film camera and the right one of a set of heavy lenses in the 80s. There is still value in being intentional, but digital allows for the incidental.<br>3. I can adjust immediately while I still have the light. Most photography I do depends HEAVILY on the lighting. Sunlight gleaming off something, shadows highlighting details on something, or just the vivid color of a flower at a certain time of day. With film, the best I could do was take a few shots and hope one turned out. A professional might take a whole role of film on one subject just to have a better chance. I can take a photo, see what I did wrong, adjust, and dial in exactly what I want in a way I could never do through a viewfinder.<br><br>While I see the value in film and want to see people keep trying it out each generation, I think it&#39;s also important not to lose what makes digital special. We&#39;ve gotten so used to it, but it&#39;s good to not let it become just a background thing but learn what it truly enables for you. I hope that those trying out film don&#39;t treat it as just a neat experience but bring what they learn from it to a new view of photography in general, whatever sort you take up from there.", "comment_date": "2022-03-19T22:45:40Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Bzapp725", "comment_text": "They still make this stuff!!?", "comment_date": "2022-03-19T22:44:42Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Nathan Rawlins", "comment_text": "&quot;huge comeback&quot; aka hipsters.", "comment_date": "2022-03-19T22:43:13Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Michael Niger", "comment_text": "Wow I am to know I probably drove right past you that day is unreal.

The film was about 6.6 inches wide and shot past an exposure slit at 200 inches per second.  The absolutely bonkers thing about this camera was that the direction that the film went past the slot (and the slot itself) would rotate by 120 degrees in the couple of seconds that it took to shoot one frame.  Go reread that sentence, your brain was probably unwilling to parse it correctly the first time.<br><br>The film for that satellite was made by Kodak, supplied on two rolls that were 8 feet in diameter.  The film was 30 miles long.  To make that work, they had to get the base down to around 1 mil thick (the emulsion was a little less than 1 mil thick as well).  The thin film was delicate, and they could afford no breaks because there was nobody to re-thread the film through the camera if it broke.  So many of the film capstans weren&#39;t rotating wheels, but were instead air bearings.  The film rode on a thin layer of compressed air.<br><br>After exposure, the film was routed through takeup reels in four reentry vehicles, so that it was first wound onto the last reel in the sequence. When that was full (every 3-4 months), they&#39;d chop the film, close the capsule around the reel, and drop the capsule.  The next reel in the line would then start to take up the film.<br><br>The reentry capsules would eventually parachute down, and would be caught over the Pacific in midair by a plane with an enormous fork on the nose, which would snag the parachute.  They missed the first one but caught the next 75.<br><br>It all seems completely farfetched but I&#39;ve talked to a bunch of the engineers on the project.

While my parents were at work and my other brothers were doing something else, my Aunt and Uncle took me to show them where the Kodak plant was and we took a tour there.  I was also into model RR and learned Kodak use to have the the very few ever built, thermos steam engines for their RR.  These operated by having an insulated steam bottle with no fire.  There were steam fittings all around the plant the engine could  recharge the bottle with steam to run, till they had to recharge the bottle again.", "comment_date": "2022-03-19T16:33:15Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Zachariah Haske", "comment_text": "Ohhhhh my goooodddd yessssssss!

They had a very pragmatic-besides-scientific approach to developing new photochemistry.  They had several teams of job-trained chemical technicians do experiments around the clock to test new ways to solve problems to produce a higher quality film for less.  Unlike science, they didn&#39;t so much care how or why something worked, they more cared IF it worked.  <br>I take Xrays now in the hospital system in Rochester, and I&#39;m always running into Kodak vets asking me about the technology we use today.  I tell them, when I was in school 11 years ago, we learned with film because film is truly the best at teaching photography fundamentals that xray photography and normal photography share.  How they make black and white xray film is truly remarkable because the film must be so high quality and it&#39;s VERY LARGE.  A lot of hospitals have barrels and barrels of old film that have thousands of dollars of silver to be recycled.  Anyways, today virtually everyone uses 2 technologies in Xray, CR and DR.  CR is older, it&#39;s like a reusable film scanned with a machine, it&#39;s much cheaper to produce though it&#39;s slower to operate.  DR at least in my department is more common.  It works in a similar way to a photodetector in a phone camera, in that it&#39;s instantaneous.  Where photofilm is much smaller than xray film, the DR sensors which are 14x17inches or 17x17inches ARE ENORMOUS compared to the tiny, puny sensors in your phones and cameras.  These plates we carry around and occasionally drop on the floor cost anywhere between 40-100 thousand dollars.  But they take GREAT xrays and because they are Digital we can adjust the contrast which is super useful.  At the moment spatial resolution of film is STILL better than these new DR detectors, but to be honest in the past, most radiologist weren&#39;t looking at an xray with a magnifying glass all the time.  Hey maybe you could do a show on some of the new xray technology?  I&#39;d really like to see how these DR detectors are made!  Carestream, a child company of Kodak makes good ones that I use, Canon may still make them, Samsung used to make them but they broke too easily and when Kodak made them, they made some of the best on the planet, they must have been a fortune to buy 15-20 years ago.", "comment_date": "2022-03-19T15:57:38Z", "likes_count": 5}, {"comment_by": "bobcansee", "comment_text": "I live about 45 min from Kodak.

Thank you for the video. I used to work in a PCB (printed circuit board) shop. For a while I was the photo tool guy. The engineers would design the board and it would have multiple layers and each layer had its own pattern. We would put large sheets of film into a photo plotter and then a laser would &quot;draw&quot; the design onto the film. This was in a dark room. The film was ejected from the plotter when it was finished and then it would go into a developer. The developer was built into the wall of the dark room. The in feed was in the dark but the developed film came out on the other side of the wall in the regular light. The whole thing was really interesting but I never liked mess with the chemicals in the developers. We only had one photo plotter but we had multiple developers. If the was a problem it was always with the developer so we had two just to make sure that we always had one working. In the dark room, everything was painted black. The door was a light baffle so entering you transitioned from a normal light room through the light baffle into the dark room with black walls and a very faint red light that didn&#39;t expose the film. That transition into the dark zig zagging was easy to walk into the wall or someone else coming out. Your eyes need a little time to adjust to the dim red light.

It operates in just the same way as this accumulator does using a pulley system..", "comment_date": "2022-03-19T15:35:33Z", "likes_count": 33}, {"comment_by": "Bruno Henrique", "comment_text": "alright Veritasium, stop changing the thumbnail every 5 minutes please", "comment_date": "2022-03-19T15:35:28Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Michael Lazorchak", "comment_text": "I was the product manager for a 120+ year old continuous compounding and extrusion systems OEM here in Saginaw, Michigan for 10 years.
