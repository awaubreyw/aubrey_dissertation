Put simply, it is because of the fact that the room is rectangular. The corners are farther away from the axis of rotation (spinning blades) and the light can travel farther before it hits the wall. This allows the light to be the highest at the corners and lowest between the corners. <br><br>To understand this on a deeper level, try visualizing the light beam on a 2D platform at any given point in time (meaning freeze time). When you have no collective input, the light beam is completely horizontal (no y component) and you get a straight line all the way through the rotation. When you add collective input, the light beam is pointing up or down from the rotational plane (the horizontal/straight line from earlier) with an angle \u03b8. Now, the rotational plane and light beam create a right triangle with the wall. <br><br>The rotational plane is the x component, how high the beam is up or down the wall is the y component, and the light beam itself is the magnitude (hypotenuse of right triangle). As the light beam maintains its angle (\u03b8) with the rotational plane, the distance of the x component (how far the blades are from the wall) affects the y component (how high the light goes up the wall). Say, a large distance (x) would mean a bigger height (y). That is why the light beam is higher (or lower) in the corners compared to the middle of the wall. <br><br>The reason why it is hyperbolic is because if we were able to see the physical light beams itself during collective input (would&#39;ve been made possible with a fog machine), then the beams would&#39;ve created a single cone. The wall is your plane that is cutting into your cone, which is why the line you see on the wall is a hyperbola (half of it at least). If we had two lasers (one of them opposing the laser in this video), then the second laser would make a second cone opposite to the first cone. The end result would be a double-mapped cone and a full hyperbola. This took me a while to figure out.<br><br><i>I don&#39;t have any drawings to help you visualize what I&#39;m trying to say, sorry. If you read this far, may I say you are a wonderful and patient human being.</i><br><br><b>Conclusion(s): If you did this demonstration in a cylindrical room, then the line should remain straight during any collective input. The wall is the plane that is cutting into the cone the light beam creates when there is collective input into the helicopter which is the reason why the line is hyperbolic.</b>", "comment_date": "2018-06-12T00:40:12Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "antsolja", "comment_text": "i believe there are low tech helis that do tilt the shaft in order to control pitch and roll", "comment_date": "2018-04-21T01:37:55Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Samuel Nelson", "comment_text": "You should connect with this guy :O incredible! <a href=\"https://youtu.be/fulJntRSHkA\">https://youtu.be/fulJntRSHkA</a>", "comment_date": "2018-03-27T04:41:40Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "soth1 sol", "comment_text": "i couldn&#39;t hear all the sciencey explanations over the pink floyd soundtrack playing in my mindz", "comment_date": "2018-03-20T18:04:25Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Eldon Ashbaugh", "comment_text": "Fisrt of all how do you get your son to keep his room so clean?<br>Question, when you increase the pitch to go up don&#39;t you have to increase engine power ?", "comment_date": "2018-03-09T16:56:21Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "CodyCs", "comment_text": "Voice crack!!!
