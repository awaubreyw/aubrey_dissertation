I am wondering what we as the humans here on earth get out of space exploration. I know it must very very expensive to do the research that has been done and is being done. Part of me wonders if that money could be better used in human development. At the same time I am a passionate Christian and I know in the Bible it says in Psalm 19:1 The heavens declare the glory of God and the skies proclaim the work of his hands. So I really am all for funding space exploration, but I am just wondering if you can ad any insight on how the knowledge of space effects our daily lives here on earth and how we benefit for it?

I really love the work that you are doing and i think you have one of the best science channels on YouTube. i am a subscriber and i always check my subscriptions to see if you have uploaded a new vid- btw really enjoyed the butterfly wing video! I was wondering if you could help me out with a science question that i have. I know it is off topic but please hear me out. My question is regarding nociceptors (pain receptors) in the human body. I have learnt that our skin contains a lot of it as well as other parts of our bodies like our muscles and organs- but heres where i need some help. You see so basically the nociceptors in our skin is going to detect a lot of external pain and the nociceptors in our muscles and organ may be orientated to internal pain but i am not sure so my question to you is: if God forbid a person were to be stuck in a building thats on fire and is engulfed in flames for a period of time where all of his skin on his body has burnt out completely then Yes we can both agree that the person experienced probably the worst form of pain ever amd we can agree that he experienced a lot pain! now where i am confused is the part where all of his skin is burnt out meaning all of the nociceptors are dead and now the next layer/part/organ after the skin is now starting to burn (i dont know what comes next) but whatever this next part is can you tell me if this person will  now continue to feel any pain at all? or how much of pain would he now experience as compared to when his skin were being burnt?<br>Thank you so much for reading this comment. I sincerely apologise if i have this comment in the wrong place, ideally i would like to send you an email but i cant see any email address any where. also if any of you other peeps know the answer to my question please do enlighten me i would gladly appreciate it if you guys can supply me with some scientific proof/references along with your answers.
