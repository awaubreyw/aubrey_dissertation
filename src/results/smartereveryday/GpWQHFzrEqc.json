I\u2019ve been thinking about the consequences of it on many different aspects of our society. And I may be wrong, but it seems to me like the pattern and consequences are the same (yelling), no matter what the subject in discussion is. I\u2019m an information tech at an university in Orlando FL, and my job is to find solutions. (that\u2019s a very simplistic way of describing an IT) So in the back of my mind, not very actively, I\u2019ve been trying to find a solution to polarization, as I\u2019ve noticed traces of it all over our life. For example; I\u2019ve noticed polarization on marital arguments, administrative discussions, professional expertise, faith based arguments and of course on political perspectives. \r<br>Now, four years later, it is impossible not to see the polarization gap has grown bigger by a lot at the political level, and as a result the yelling also has increased. And I still haven\u2019t found a tangible solution. \r<br>What makes it interesting is, that to my understanding, the polarization is a collective behavior, and the solution seems to be an individual behavior. So to establish a perspective you listen to different collective opinions but to establish a wise conclusion, the decision has to be made in a personal level. \r<br>Making that balance between collectives opinions and a personal conclusion seems to be against our human nature, since we are social entities. I\u2019ve also noticed that those social groups with different opinions tend to reject those who dare to listen to the other group\u2019s perspectives. Such behavior from our society makes it more difficult to gather information from different points of the spectrum. \r<br>Education would be a nice starting point. But it feels like it isn\u2019t always a convenient solution. Specifically for those providing the information, since by nature we want others to share our same opinion. So an open discussion would be an open door for others to flip sides. So we tend to control open discussions to our convenience. \r<br>In essence, I believe polarization is here to stay. We just have to learn to deal with it. Education and the ability to make a personal conclusion are key factors. \r<br>But I want to thank you for bringing up such a perspective on your video and provoking our thoughts.", "comment_date": "2020-12-07T22:31:04Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Trevor Rogers", "comment_text": "Obama loves rockets.

I&#39;m a student  from Western Michigan University double majoring in both Engineering and Communications. What you are talking about is a mix of two different communication theories. The first is called Social Information Processing Theory which talks about computer mediated communication where people are more &quot;comfortable&quot; to speak their mind when they are on the internet or not face to face. The second is Cognitive Dissonance Theory. This one talks about how people don&#39;t like dissonance so they expose themselves to whatever creates the least dissonance in their lives. I love watching your videos and I love the way you analyze everything like an engineer. There are reasons for everything, including non-verbals. This is one of the main reasons i picked a second major so vastly different from Engineering.

Obama is not just another guy, and he is not just misunderstood, he does not hold just another viewpoint like he likes Oreos but I like chocolate chip. He forcefully and illegally pushed a dangerous, destructive, and anti-freedom, anti-American, agenda knowing the consequences on the common man but continuing anyway. I do not believe Obama deserves any more respect than a common criminal, since he was not legally eligible to be a US president among the other things I just mentioned.

Several cool reward levels allow you to tailor your subscription.  I would like to convince you to choose one, even at $1, so you have access to the Smarter Every Day feed here at Patreon.

If you&#39;d like to go above and beyond to help me do things like travel for an episode, invest in equipment, create animations, help designers to make daily infographics (for twitter/tumblr/facebook), and pay for my kids&#39; current and future education.... picking any of the larger support levels will certainly help do these things! <br><br>I believe it goes without saying that I would greatly appreciate your financial support. I&#39;ll say it anyways though. Thank you. I greatly appreciate it.

Prior to social media, there wasn&#39;t as much demographic feedback available to traditional media outlets, like television and print news.  As such, they would cast a broader net.  They would have a political tilt one way or another, but the only people they would alienate would be those on the <i>extreme</i> of the other side, already.  Print and television media wouldn&#39;t really repel the center very strongly.  Whether we wanted it or not, we were constantly exposed to opposing view points, because we were passive targets of media.  Now, with social networks, we&#39;re active curators of our media.  We select what aligns with us.  In turn, this makes available a trove of demographic data to traditional media providers.  As people surround themselves in an affirmative chorus, the media outlets <i>must</i> trend out toward the extremes to keep up with the shifting demographic, lest they be seen as outdated, irrelevant, or worse, in opposition to the views they seek to market to.  While the media helps reinforce our ideas, the sad fact is, Fox News wasn&#39;t far enough to the right for its audience, since the advent of social media.  We no longer need the nightly news to tell us what to think.  We do that in our affirmative choruses.

It seems the interviewer is frequently amazed how &quot;normal&quot; regular guy&quot; etc. the person is and maybe a little starstruck.  Maybe we wouldn&#39;t be so divided if we realize that president , astronaut or whatever are people like us.  They are extremely well  suited for the situation they find themselves and frequently have honed their skills to be the best at what they do but they are still people like us. People who succeed without cheating  deserve our respect. I hope we all get that our personal best is something to go for and for others to appreciate. All of us, including these successful individuals, are also are moved by &quot;secondary gains&quot; and that is normal.  But deep down inside we are very similar.

As someone who grew up with a British-style education system and took the SAT in the middle of my IB diploma a few years ago, it was immediately apparent to me how the one-dimensional style of writing that is encouraged in the SAT&#39;s essay questions is (perhaps accidentally) teaching the wrong values to far too many young people in the American education system, both domestic and international. I was taught to only argue one point per essay, rather than the minimum &quot;2 points for &amp; 1 point against&quot; format typically seen in most Baccalaureate exams/essays in Europe.  The erosion of reasonable discussion in modern times seems, at least from my perspective, to be a product of many different facets of society including education and entertainment media as well as the &quot;mainstream news&quot;, because in reality few people agree on every issue, yet it is useful for those in power to influence the average Joe and Jane to categorize those who disagree with them on a select few points (sexual orientation, religion, economic stance, WHATEVER), and pit otherwise good people against one another.", "comment_date": "2016-02-05T12:39:48Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "umiumihiroi", "comment_text": "Thanks for your great shows.

Think about that: how many times have to be repeated the truth? Obviously, the truth is self sufficient with the explanations, so once would be sufficient.

We try to recommend things which fall within what we think that person wants to hear/read/see, because that&#39;s what gets them using one service over another (for example, if Netflix only recommended movies you disliked, you wouldn&#39;t use it and would likely go to their competitor (especially if said competitor only recommended movies you like)).<br><br>And while such a system is great for entertainment, it&#39;s not so great for news, facts, and debates (as it makes it such that you might not even know an opposing view exists).<br><br>That being said, when it comes to social or political issues I think YouTube tends to recommend videos of views that go against mine.  But that&#39;s because if I watch videos on said subject I&#39;m more likely to watch the video which opposes my views.  And while I often strongly disagree with what these people are saying I still try to understand why they think how they do.<br><br>As for a solution to the issue really all I can think of is better educating students to look for and understand the opposing arguments.  When I was in school we weren&#39;t taught very well as to the reason to look into opposing arguments, we were simply told &quot;you have to show both sides&quot;.  When the reality is you need to understand why the opposing view exists in the first place, and then you need to understand why your view exists.  Then you need to address all the points the opposing view makes; and the only way to do that is to fully understand them.  So most often what would happen in school is people would just state what the opposing views are but not really expand upon them or prove their own view compared to the opposing view.  There&#39;s also another very large issue in that schools punish you for being wrong.  Meaning that people are sort of trained to hold onto their arguments far more strongly in debate even if they themselves know they can&#39;t back it up due to a fear of being proven wrong (and of course there&#39;s also the other issue as to how we go about debates; we often put the other person into a defensive mindset in which case they pretty much will not understand your point of view because they&#39;re too busy trying to defend theirs).<br><br>Another potential solution would be to make a news source that isn&#39;t biased.  One of the big problems is how the source of a lot of peoples information is essentially saying &quot;the other view is wrong they&#39;re stupid&quot; and simply discrediting them and shrugging them off, being unwilling to hear the argument.  When in reality it&#39;s rare (or even simply non-existent) that any view is right or wrong.<br><br>I myself tend to avoid debates/arguments due to the fact people are often unwilling to consider the other view.  Although on occasion I do participate in debates but it&#39;s very rare (and it&#39;s only if I understand both sides of the argument).  One debate I&#39;m happy to join in on is the whole privacy debate, as I understand the reasons for and against quite well, even though I feel very strongly about one side of the argument.<br><br>Although debates are sort of null these days as most people won&#39;t change their views after a debate, so it&#39;s kind of pointless.  That does depend on who you debate with though, and what you debate on.  As certain topics are too polarizing, whereas others there&#39;s more of a common ground; which is a much nicer place to be as it&#39;s more possible to get things done through debate.  Whereas if you&#39;re so polarized you&#39;re unlikely to change your view and the opposition is unlikely to change their view (as the views are just too far apart).<br><br><br>I really do think that the way things are going is quite dangerous, as I&#39;ve heard of instances of colleges and universities simply not allowing someone to speak due to having an opposing view (as the students protested it due to disagreeing with their view).  College and university is the absolute last place this should ever happen, but instead, it seems to be the first place it&#39;s happening.

I still thought of myself as a republican because...well,  that&#39;s all I knew. <br><br>Science, cosmology, growing together as a human race, and how we can move forward together, that&#39;s important to me.  The day I heard about President Obama&#39;s veto for the  Keystone XL bill, I started to take time to listen more to what he had to say.  The more I listened without bias, the more I realized that we share some of the same views.  I mean, how can that be?  I&#39;m 100% full blown republican.

I learned 2 things, one of which I acted upon immediately, and a second which I&#39;d like some help to act upon.<br> <br>Ok, so the first (and this was from the first interview, not the smarter every day interview, so apologies for that!), but I was reminded how important recognition is, and I&#39;ve immediately implemented some actions in my team to meaningfully incentivise certain behaviours I consider crucial to our business (I&#39;m a scientist) that I hadn&#39;t thought to do before, so thanks to the first interviewer for that!<br><br>Secondly, the discussion about increasing polarisation, and the need to ensure we listen and are aware of the other side&#39;s arguments, I feel is a crucial failing of modern society, and one I think new media, with its subscriptions, likes, tailored content etc, while making content more widely available, risks exacerbating. So, my question to the followers of Smarter Every Day is: as a left-leaning European, but with a genuine interest in US politics (having just spent the last 5 years living there, but now back in Europe), I tend to watch The Young Turk, listen to podcasts by people like Sam Harris, follow politicians like Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren, and watch comedy shows like the Nightly Show and the Daily Show. So, I&#39;m as guilty as anyone of having my biases fed by people I already agree with. I don&#39;t agree with everything from any of these, but I find them interesting because I think they each make a genuine effort to retain balance and rationality, but they&#39;re clearly from a left-wing perspective. However, the answer isn&#39;t to start watching Fox News, or listening to Rush Limbaugh or Alex Jones. My question is this: who, or the right side, would I watch/listen to on youtube/podcasts, that would give me a meaningful balance, and offer me a thoughtful and rationale opinion, that would challenge my own? Who is the Cenk Ugur or Sam Harris of the right? This is an honest question, and not intended to be sarcastic. I&#39;m sure there are plenty out there, and I&#39;d like to be more aware, so I&#39;d appreciate any suggestions.", "comment_date": "2016-01-31T21:52:34Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Amy Moorcroft", "comment_text": "I wanted to let you know that I really enjoy your videos, you are very insightful and have great passion.

They&#39;re wrong the first time or maybe two, but after that they&#39;re lying.  Unless it&#39;s particularly serious, in which case I consider the first instance dishonest.  And particularly difficult for Obama is when he says at fundraisers and in legal documents one things (he doesn&#39;t believe the 2nd amendment is a personal right), but then is dishonest in speech (we have a tradition of gun ownership in the US...)...  on the second one the intent is to deceive while technically just detailing what is seen as an obstacle.  You could call that plausible deniability, lol.<br><br>Okay, so what bothers me is the number of marginally pro-life people, or moderates who see conservatives as evil and/or more dishonest than liberals.  They have, between them, a lot of the same problems.
