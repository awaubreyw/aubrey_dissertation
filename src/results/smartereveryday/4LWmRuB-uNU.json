It&#39;s kind of safety in numbers meets going really fast and needing to not run into eachother. <br><br>Imagine a group of 100 penguins for example, walking slowly, and everyone is trying to get to the middle to avoid being eaten by sea lions around the perimeter.

If they run into eachother, they fall out of the sky and die. If they are all fairly unmaneuverable like the herons in the video, they all kinda pick a direction and stick to it other than trying to overlap and get to the middle. If they are super maneuverable like the smaller birds, the whole cluster kind of moves in whichever direction the average bird is going to try and get to the middle. <br><br>Then throw some wind into the mix, and I guess some hawks instead of flying sea lions if you&#39;re boring, and I think you have what&#39;s happening.

Ducks come to mind. Ducks are very agile and have great maneuverability in flight yet they still fly in formation and in the same direction. I think it has more to do with the fact that waterfowl fly in ways that conserve energy. On the other hand, the seemingly random movements of the flock of smaller birds seems to be more of a &quot;safety in numbers&quot; instinct to try to stick as close as possible to others around without running into them to avoid predation. Also I think this, the three perameters that are basically being followed, creates the smaller groups that often break off then rejoin the rest of the group. This requires much more energy output by each individual in the flock and in no way conserves energy so they can maintain long periods of flight and long distance movement as does the flight/flock patterns of waterfowl. I&#39;m just rambling my thoughts here now.

In fact, I wouldn&#39;t expect cranes to operate based on the same rule set.<br><br>As far as I know, these patterns are also useful to avoid getting picked off by predators easily. Cranes are most likely not hunted the same way that these smaller birds are, because e.g. for their long distance travels they fly significantly higher, where they are not easily reached.<br>My intuition is that their stronger emphasis on alignment during flight is because their behavior is focused more on exploiting each others slipstreams. Assuming they also have only three rules, they might be closer to something like: 1) If you see them, align with the highest rank bird (as far as I know this would be the oldest female. At least some migrating birds do it this way.) 2) Exploit slipstreams 3) keep pace (I once read that migrating birds rotate through, who has to fly in front of the V-formation, since the ones at the tip have it the hardest. What I mean by this rule is: If you are at the tip, stay there until you fall behind. More rested birds will take over.

I work for an electric utility and we had a location on our system that kept having outages at certain times of day. We figured out that we had overhead lines near a train switchyard. The trains were hauling grain and would periodically spill it so the birds would congregate on our lines near the spilled food. When the trains would link up it made a loud noise and scare the birds.

It&#39;s so fascinating because it is directly correlated to real-world systems that we can observe in nature!<br><br><br>Here&#39;s an example that might interest you Destin: we can use dynamical systems theory (spatial coherence, entropy) to measure the interactions between agents (boids in this example) to produce a quantitative measure of emergence. If the boids were like particles in a gas cylinder, they would have high entropy but low spatial coherence, so there would be little emergence. If the boids were like a crystal where there is high spatial coherence but low entropy,  there would be low emergence (think of those big slow birds). As Ben said, the variables have to be fine-tuned to observe and measure highly emergent behaviour.<br><br><br><br>You might be surprised to learn about the depth of the philosophies behind emergence and how macro properties are caused by micro events. Strong vs weak emergence, downwards causation, etc. <br>It can even be extended in to consciousness science, and how electrical activity in our brains causes the emergent behaviour of our experience of consciousness.

Watch the documentary call &quot;I AM&quot; my friends please watch this, it can help you to understand how important your decision&#39;s are and how what I got out of it was how close we are to change and saving our planet and the future of humanity. You absolutely matter in the outcome, my friends listen to me carefully, Love will concure over fear, focus on helping others and adding value to yourself so that you can help more, so that You can answer the question in the docmentary as he does in the end of it. Know that helping just one person can change the lives of many and can tip the scale in favor of Love and Life. I need you all to focus on creating a future you fall in Love with, Fall in Love with the future and go to work creating it day by day, Love your future more than the past and stay focused. In everything that you do find a way to use it to help others, the need is great, there are lots of opportunities to donate your money to give people basic needs like water, we forget easily how two thirds of the world lives on less than 2 dollars per day and that does not meet their needs. Look into &quot;charity water&quot; for instance, people die everyday because of drinking the only water they have access to. If ever you are in the United States and you need a reminder of just how fortunate you are to be born here just look up Africa documentaries, the poorest people here have ut relatively good by comparison. We must begin to see ourselves as One Human Family because you could have just as easily be born there and you would need someone to help you, so be there for someone, the world is currently suffering but it does not have to. If only we learn to Love, Jesus gave us a perfect example. Keep asking yourselves in every situation what would he do. Also my friends know that we are who we are today from years of our minds being programmed, the subconscious mind makes 96% of your decisions daily, the subconscious mind was either programmed by your environment or television, or shall we say tell lie vision, because it tells lies to our vision. Know that you can change your subconscious to work for you and not against you, as a child before age 7 you download everything into the subconscious mind, after that you learn by repetition, thats why they teach us the abc over and over in a song, so now that you know this you can recreate your life. If you are unhealthy, all you must do is learn something about health everyday, one day you will wake up and see a unhealthy food you thought you would eat and you will automatically say no I dont want that, my body needs this. By doing that you have now change your self image, your paradigm. If you find something a video or book you want to be like then watch it over and over or read it again and again, I read books 3 times back to back and after the third time they changed my life. You are what you are today because of your subconscious mind. Look around, how can you make it better, what can you add to your download list to become a better human being? Work on yourself more than you work on your Job. You have about 4 thousand hours of free awake time per year, you can use some of that time for this, to add value to your life and the more you grow consciously the better everything will get. You can use your life for good, you can leave this world better than how you found it, your vote counts, your choices will decide the fate of life on earth.

You may be right about the differences in flocking behavior due to size and flight abilities of birds, but I think it also has to do with risk that the different species are exposed to. Large flocks of small birds (the blackbirds and starlings) also attract predators. That risk of predation from hawks and falcons will elicit different responses, which includes more dramatic changes in direction. The flocks of small birds react much more like schools of fish (say sardines) that are attacked by both fish and bird predators. In contrast, cranes or geese flying in flocks are much more immune to predation by hawks and falcons because they are just to big. The only predatory birds able to kill the larger birds are much less abundant eagles.  (I&#39;m definitely not saying these large birds are entirely immune, but the relative risk of predation is much different).  These differences likely also lead to differences in behaviors.  <br>Now, to switch things up, bird (and other animal movements) are also dependent upon finding food (not just avoiding being food). So cranes walking around may be looking at other cranes that are feeding and moving to locations where the see evidence that food is present.  These movements are more likely be to very directional, which will be quite different from movements to avoid predation.  In addition, it looked to me like there were two different subspecies of sandhill cranes in the fields (lesser and greater). The size differences between these could also influence movement, with the greater sandhills being able to defend slightly larger areas than the lessers.  <br>Lots to think about that influences how animals move.  One avenue that you might really like is to look at foraging movements and game theory applications. This is especially well developed for flock foraging waterbirds where some find food resources (producers) and other follow them to &quot;share&quot; resources (scroungers).

I think schooling behaviour is largely done by prey animals who have a set of behaviours that help in predator avoidance, and shoaling behaviour is done by any social fish that wants to be in proximity to other fish. I guess the big difference is that fish in a school orient themselves in the same direction as fish around them and fish in a shoal do not. I think the directional orientation adaptation helps with predator avoidance because tesselating or intricately repeating patterns confuse the brain particularly well. For instance, whenever I walk across a certain crosswalk made of tesselating hexagons and look down I start to feel dizzy and spatially disoriented but walking across forest rubble of similar sizes to the hexagons does not do this to me.", "comment_date": "2020-04-28T00:53:16Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Clay Kalmar", "comment_text": "A beautiful glimpse of God&#39;s intelligent design right there.", "comment_date": "2020-04-28T00:49:30Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Radu Besliu", "comment_text": "I thought the thumbnail said &quot;masturbation&quot;...", "comment_date": "2020-04-28T00:49:24Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "mings jesse", "comment_text": "You know how it\u2019s fun to go ride bikes with your buddy\u2019s or downhill boarding or snowboarding with your buddy\u2019s.

Starlings tend to roost together in the fall and winter, as spring and summer are the times for making nests and raising their young.<br>It&#39;s a truly amazing sight and, if you get close enough, the whirring sound made by their wings, as well as their calling to each other, is quite something to hear as well!", "comment_date": "2020-04-27T21:55:09Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Nate Frisk", "comment_text": "So how many times did you get pooped on while filming this video?", "comment_date": "2020-04-27T21:54:50Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "XxTeam_Charlie", "comment_text": "I love to think about fish in the water, then birds in the air, then think about how I\u2019m just an animal equal to something that crawls along the ocean floor.

In the last decade the starfish once everywhere have ceased to exist and the ecosystem is shuddering from that sudden loss as the shockwave crashes through the rest of everything with no idea what if anything will be left as time plays out.. The complexity we get to see is only a fragment of what has been lost and very likely is on borrowed time itself as well... Ive studied nature my whole life and used to teach ecology for a time... But now there is so much that I can not even show to my grand kids that any attempt to teach about the diversity of life is just a horror story that is real and can&#39;t be ignored... And how do you face your grand children and teach them how badly that you have damaged the world they have to try to live in... well apreciate what you still can i guess like this video does.. but don&#39;t forget the damage and loss already done... nothing stays the same, the only constant is change.", "comment_date": "2020-04-27T20:05:32Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "frenchiveruti", "comment_text": "BEN EATER, MAH MEN, thanks to him I finally understood how logic Gates work on a physical level", "comment_date": "2020-04-27T20:03:56Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "EAX", "comment_text": "I read the title first as : how fooking birds make...", "comment_date": "2020-04-27T20:03:23Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "CrystalStearOfTheCas", "comment_text": "For me there&#39;s one big thing (albeit obvious) you didn&#39;t mention : why the animals follow these rules<br>Flock of birds or schools of fish drive their strength from their numbers.

We pee because we excrete nitrogen as water-soluble urea, which is very mildly toxic (so there has to be some water in the bladder, can&#39;t just be urea). Birds excrete uric acid instead, and it&#39;s insoluble so there&#39;s almost no water in there. Obviously an advantage not to have to fly around with that water (and not have to drink it to begin with)... but on the other hand, the biochemical pathways to make uric acid are more complicated and require more energy than making urea. So the tradeoff is not worth it in many other situations.

First, as another person noted, we are using math to quantify a natural/biologic behavior, not the other way round.  The birds are merely reacting to the other birds. <br><br><br><br>The second point you seem to be missing, that also has nothing to do with math, is motivation.  What is motivating the birds do this?  The answer is food in most cases.  They are flying after insects that you can&#39;t see.  As one bird sees the insects, other birds will turn to follow as the insects are swarming for protection from the birds and will be in large groups.  Where there is one bug, there are probably many so the birds follow the ones turning in hopes of sharing in the meal, even though they may not see the swarm of insects themselves.  I&#39;ve seen this same kind of behavior in schooling fish in the ocean.<br><br><br>As for the larger birds, the motivation is different for them.  They seek food on the ground because they don&#39;t have the agility to take food aloft.  Their bodies are longer and larger which is perfect for long straight flights such as migration which is what they do. <br><br><br><br>As for math being used to quantify nature, we see this in aircraft design, especially in the form of military aircraft. Small fighter that need to be agile tend to have shorter wings and fuselages that allow them to turn on a dime to attack small moving targets of opportunity.  But bombers, designed to fly to and attack a larger stationary target, have longer wing spans and fuselages that are great for long, straight flights to their predesignated targets.", "comment_date": "2020-04-27T15:29:38Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "BOLL", "comment_text": "I live next to a lake in Sweden where we also get migrating cranes, my memory makes them with a darker patterning though, so probably completely unrelated \ud83d\ude0b Wrong side of the pond I imagine, but I&#39;m not a birds person so just guessing.", "comment_date": "2020-04-27T15:29:30Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Anuron Ironworks", "comment_text": "This video was interesting enough that I increased my resolution from my normal 360p to 720p and let it buffer for a while just so I could see clearly", "comment_date": "2020-04-27T15:28:53Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "BlueBaconJake", "comment_text": "Destin: ok just watch the birds!<br>Youtube compression: <b><i>Nope</i></b>", "comment_date": "2020-04-27T15:27:49Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Ahmed L", "comment_text": "Fishes do the same thing ?", "comment_date": "2020-04-27T15:27:20Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "kaysindre", "comment_text": "Youtube quality: AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH", "comment_date": "2020-04-27T15:26:37Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Justin Maynard", "comment_text": "Regarding the large birds...they land and take off into the wind.

Near us was a natural area following the path of a stream, about 1/3 mile wide and many miles long. One year the area had a population explosion of starlings who flew in this manner but with a difference. For several months, I would wake up and look out my window to see what appeared to be a column of smoke rising from the forest, but was actually tens of millions of birds taking off from the trees to fly into Washington to feed during the day. The stream of birds would begin at some point down stream, which I couldn&#39;t see, and the source point of the birds taking off would slowly move up the valley as the birds left the immediate area heading for town. This would go on for about an hour or more, slowly making its way upstream until the source of the column was so far away I could no longer see it. The best comparison I can describe was like watching a steam locomotive spouting billowing black smoke as the train ran down the track. The huge number of birds created a major problem with buildings in DC. Many of the government buildings, such as the federal triangle, White House, Smithsonian and Capital, had to put electric fence wires on all the horizontal ledges and window sills to keep the birds from perching on the face of the buildings where their acidic droppings were covering the building walls and causing deterioration of the marble and granite facings.
