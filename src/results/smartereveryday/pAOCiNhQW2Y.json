The first instance you can notice it there is after the initial cloud of impact is starting to clear and separate. At that point the baseball had left the container of sprinkles. But if you look back at the footage, the dust kind of clears and those spots in the corner are already there. Some sprinkles got launched so hard and fast from that impact they hit that frame and created enough heat to melt together.<br><br>I mean that&#39;s a given that that was the event that occurred, but it&#39;s amazing that it happened that fast. That is so much energy being imparted to those sprinkles to melt them that much and even to the sprinkles that deformed on the backstop. But you think of how much energy is needed to melt a sprinkle from impact and then launching a few dozen sprinkles from another impact, this thing just gets wilder and wilder.<br><br>Also, I think the disappointment you got from the jar of mayo was due to the smell, the mess, and your expectations of the forecasted mess coming true. It&#39;s almost like a dad thing. You know there&#39;s a potential for a horrendous mess, but you still promised them you&#39;d do &quot;anything&quot;.

When filming from the side, how do you account for the parallax effect of the lens? Only dead in front of the camera are you measuring 100% lateral movement. When the ball leaves the cannon, it is is say 10 degrees from centre of the camera line of sight.  Sorry, my terminology isn&#39;t great; I&#39;m not a mathematician or an engineer...  Or is this a non factor because the same parallax is applied to the distance markers? What I&#39;m trying to say, is that because you&#39;re looking at the ball&#39;s path at exactly 90 degrees ONLY when it&#39;s directly in front of the camera, how do you account for pixels on a 2D screen representing different distances depending on the ball&#39;s location in a 3D world? <br><br>I hope that makes sense. As I say, I&#39;m not a scientist or mathematician of any sort so I struggle to express what I&#39;m trying to ask or explain.  It&#39;s a linear scale in the 3D world when the ball leaves the cannon, from a 2D frame of reference because of angles, there&#39;s a parallax. I&#39;m guessing the simple answer is that is difference is so small it probably doesn&#39;t matter.<br>Thanks!", "comment_date": "2021-11-04T12:26:53Z", "likes_count": 16}, {"comment_by": "Lski3", "comment_text": "No Hellmann&#39;s Real Mayonnaise was harmed in the making of this video.", "comment_date": "2021-11-04T12:06:23Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Redzuan Salam", "comment_text": "Dear Destin, may I give you a pen?", "comment_date": "2021-11-04T11:59:04Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Random Tourist", "comment_text": "I just need a Sitrep on the black Pen Destin borrowed", "comment_date": "2021-11-04T11:49:51Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Cristy", "comment_text": "that looks MAD CREAMYYYYY", "comment_date": "2021-11-04T11:47:57Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Daniel Ludmann", "comment_text": "That man loves his pen", "comment_date": "2021-11-04T11:47:04Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "mat tomon", "comment_text": "with the shot with the sprinkles the cover of the ball was coming off. before  it hit", "comment_date": "2021-11-04T11:14:59Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Rusty Redden", "comment_text": "This is how you get ants", "comment_date": "2021-11-04T11:12:30Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Mobi Gi", "comment_text": "Does its on a fake body", "comment_date": "2021-11-04T11:04:59Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "chris smith", "comment_text": "Watch at <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pAOCiNhQW2Y&amp;t=14m30s\">14:30</a> you can see that some of the sprinkles actually turned  from sprinkles to cotton candy strands floating in the air", "comment_date": "2021-11-04T10:54:25Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "David Weeks", "comment_text": "Hope those aren&#39;t Warren&#39;s baseballs.

The box air pressure would increase but be allowed to escape through a reversed funnel reducing down to about 4 inches in diameter and then expanding via a reversed funnel (attached to the first one) in which there would be created a low pressure just past the joint of the two funnels\u2026. At that location is where the HEP would terminate and (hopefully) create enough low pressure to draw the exhaust/smoke from the HEP and stove. There would also be a separate fresh air feed into the front of the stove for makeup air.  Searching the internet there seems to be nothing out there like this and thought this would be a good DIY project but would like you all to build one and see how the adjustment location of the end of the HEP would need to be placed (perhaps making it someone adjustable) as the best low pressure \u2018spot\u2019 must be critical.

Well, that and the insane amount of pressure you would need to generate. Anyways, you can get a little bit more speed by doing what the Air Force did at the High Speed Test Track at Holloman AFB NM. They were having a problem getting the test vehicle into hypersonic speeds. The air drag would heat the nose to white hot. But, how can you reduce the drag? The solution was a three mile (!) long by 3 foot diameter plastic baggy filled with pure helium. The moment the sled forebody entered the tube, drag was reduced by ~80%. All that thrust that was wasted before was now free to propel the sled. You could tell the moment the sled entered the helium by the sudden jump on the acceleration chart. Looking at the high speed photos, you could see the nose of the sled was white hot and when it entered the helium, it went to a dull cherry red. The end result was the sled achieving hypersonic speeds of 9,000+ fps. The other problem was how do you stop an earthbound body moving at 9,000 fps when your track is only 10 miles long? Mayonaise was not an option, so a 10 foot solid cube of concrete was used instead. A 120 lb. body traveling at 9,000 fps does carry enough energy to vaporize the block. <br><br>You could use the helium baggy trick.  But, given the shorter distance you use and the flat trajectory, it would be quite possible to use a clear 8 inch or larger stiff plastic tube from the muzzle to the target. Then pull a vacuum on the entire assembly. The tube would have to be strong enough to take the pressure from the initial pressure release. With the ball in a vacuum from the back of the barrel to the end of the tube, you should be able to get a significant boost in speed to the target.", "comment_date": "2021-11-02T13:29:52Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Kairu ", "comment_text": "It&#39;ll be like a gun if it were to hit a person, although that&#39;s just my guess.", "comment_date": "2021-11-02T13:29:08Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "surfcello", "comment_text": "Are you accounting for parallax / the angle of aperture of the camera when doing distance /speed measurements?

A thought and two weeks later and we had shooter that used two vacuum cleaner motors with makeshift tires fastened to the top of each rotor pin.  Similar to a pitching machine in baseball.  Putting a ping pong ball close to the oppositely rotating tires grabbed it with great force and shot it out the other side.  The ping pong ball shot out insanely fast but we had no way of measuring its velocity.  <br><br>Fast forward 4 years and as a senior in H.S. my son needed to bring in a working machine to his physics lab.  So...in the lab he fired it up and let a ping pong ball loose.  It curved, missing the target, and hit the corner of a porcelain sink.  The ball was destroyed and the sink had a small missing chip of porcelain and a tiny crack.  I guess the class roared at the destruction.

Unless your camera is infinity feet away.  The further away your are, the less off you will be, but like I said, until you make it to infinity, there will be an error.  It&#39;s trigonometry.  The 15 foot mark is closer to the camera than the points that are left and right of it.  The further left and right, the further you are from the camera.
