I really enjoyed speaking with him and Jonny.  I started this process thinking the Seals probably focus on the ability to overpower the enemy and smash things, but it turns out humility and the ability to work on a team is by far the most important attribute.

When Chris or Johnny speak about SEAL teams, do they need to get clearance from their communications team, as their words would have a huge impact on how people perceive this team, or is it that your entire video recording is seen and cleared by someone in authority, prior to upload.

What is harder is the toll taken on us because of morals. Having to turn patients away because covid comes first(when there hardly are any) hurts a lot. Not allowing people to visit their dying family hurts a lot. Watching admin redirect funds for new equipment or staff to pay for signs and floor stickers hurts a lot. We are getting laid off because patient counts are down because they have restricted who needs help. I appreciate everyone who has to deal with this, but the struggle isnt an overabundance.
