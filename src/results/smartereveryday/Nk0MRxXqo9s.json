Due the COVID trouble it was difficult to travel and we didn&#39;t wanted to go trough the trouble. Anyways, the 2020 eclipse never could have topped the spirit of the 2019 one. So all good.

VPNs can&#39;t completely hide your identity or location, regardless of what they claim. That is not what they were originally designed for. They are intended to keep your data secure between your home or mobile computer and a very specific, single LAN. Once you try to extend beyond that, you are leaving any security behind. Back when it was first noticed that you could use a VPN to mask your real location there was some initial success in fooling geofencing, but in the last couple of years every single VPN I have tried has failed to get past geofences because once they realize that&#39;s an issue it is actually rather easy to detect the use of a VPN. Once the VPN is detected, if all they want is to enforce the geofence all they have to do is deny access. If they are more interested in getting your identity and real location, there are forensic tools that can do that as well. As for keeping your data safe, that&#39;s only good between your device and the VPN servers.

For instance, when the corona  &quot;bursts out&quot;, it&#39;s like nothing in this world. Can&#39;t describe it. It&#39;s worth travelling all the way to Argentina to see something like that, alone. And then there&#39;s that &quot;360 degree sunset&quot; all around the edge of the world, as soon as it gets dark enough. And the depth of the navy in the blue of the sky during totality, and all the blues of the whole &quot;dome of the heavens&quot; above. The birds started singing their sunset songs, then they went quiet as the little night set in, and then they sang their dawn chorus for the second time that day.<br><br>Short version: Thanks not just for sharing the lovely romance of your Argentinian eclipse, but also for bringing back all those memories.<br><br>And although your pictures are great, pictures can&#39;t describe this phenomenon. It&#39;s even <b>better</b> than it looks from the pictures. To other fans of your channel, I would say: Be willing to travel far, to travel rough, to travel to the edges of your budget, in order to go and see an eclipse.<br><br>Mind you, there are risks. The Southern African eclipse happened during generally cloudy conditions. Near Musina/Beit Bridge, there was a break in the clouds very close to the time that the eclipse shadow passed over there; in the Kruger Park, the skies stayed grey all day, and all their eclipse was, was a bit of darkness (and the game lay low, waiting for the weather to improve, so it meant that those who thought they&#39;d kill two birds with one stone, there, ended up killing nothing. I suppose it&#39;s nice not to kill birds, but ... ja ... )<br><br>It&#39;s just the shadow of the Moon, but somehow it feels like one of the most significant events of my life.
