Tie to the fallen one slightly above the first prop tree (tall stump), run rope away from house to pull tree off of &quot;stump&quot; without trunk coming closer to house. (A come-along or block and tackle would come in handy here) once you get it off of the first &quot;stump&quot; you may have to figure what to do all over again, because trees bound by other trees don&#39;t always behave as it seems they should. I had an 8-inch pine suddenly come unbound and swing across both shins like a baseball bat. I was very fortunate to just walk around with pain for quite some time, it could have been much worse.
