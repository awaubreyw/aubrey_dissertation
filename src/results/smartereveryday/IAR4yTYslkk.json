That does several things. One is that it creates a brief <b>reverse flow</b> of gasses around the bullet which easily accounts for your observation that local supersonic flow around a subsonic bullet did not appear until it had traveled a short distance from the muzzle. Another is that the reverse flow may upset the bullet causing it to either become unstable or delay it \u201cgoing to sleep\u201d as is sometimes observed with VLD bullets. Obviously, supersonic has flow is going to generate more noticeable noise than subsonic gas flow. There are a number of factors here. Gas pressure at bullet exit from the muzzle and gas volume come readily to mind. <br><br>The second is gas flow which precedes bullet exit from the muzzle. That is generally regarded as flow around the bullet as it is engraved by the rifling or less than perfect sealing with the rifling. It is more or less taken as a given because it is of a small magnitude and does not appear to affect accuracy.", "comment_date": "2020-09-12T17:03:09Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Sheepdog Chappy", "comment_text": "Don&#39;t be ashamed of the coolness of firearms.... they are too cool for a reason.", "comment_date": "2020-09-11T19:56:11Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Bryan Caromunoz", "comment_text": "Who is out there complaining about YOUR channel and YOUR content???

Even in cases where the theoretical model indicates 100% burn, the reality is that there&#39;s usually a little bit of residue that didn&#39;t conform to the model, leaving some behind in the barrel or suppressor baffles. Subsonic cartridges are particularly prone to this behavior because nitrocellulose powder burn rates are, in part, a function of the pressure of the burn chamber, and because subsonic cartridges have a hard cap on their velocity, so they struggle to reach sufficient pressure and barrel time to get complete combustion under any circumstance.<br><br>300 Blackout uses a .308&quot; diameter projectile and standard American 30 caliber bore. The diameter of across the grooves will be .308&quot; and the diameter across the lands will be .304&quot;, or very near to it. Once the projectile has engaged the rifling, there should be little to no blow-by of gasses, let alone powder grains. Common propellants for the 300 Blackout cartridge will have small, spherical granules that average .019&quot; in diameter.<br><br>Given that it is a long, heavy-for-caliber projectile, I also doubt that it is a case of the trailing edge of the bearing surface clearing the case mouth before the leading edge of the bearing surface is fully engaged with the rifled bore. This, to me, eliminates the possibility of gas blow-by between the projectile and the unrifled free bore portion of the chamber. This difference will be approximately .001&quot; in diameter, so even with a bullet having a shorter bearing surface than the free bore, there isn&#39;t sufficient clearance for the propellant granules.<br><br>So the granules are most certainly not from the cartridge being fired, but where is their propulsion coming from? Fluid mechanics is not my forte. However, my suspicion is that the ambient air molecules from the chamber to the muzzle are being compressed, by the accelerating projectile, faster than the the air is able to flow out of the muzzle at ambient temperature and pressure. At some point, the pressure is becomes high enough to flow out of the muzzle above Mach and carry the residual powder granules out at transsonic or even hypersonic velocity.", "comment_date": "2018-12-30T22:43:18Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Asura", "comment_text": "This should be the ultimate and dare i say - only - use of weapons<br><br>The study of physics through the combination with a object so we can view the hypothesis happening, allowing us to explain and understand great physics", "comment_date": "2018-12-30T16:23:13Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "AlfaIndiaRomeo", "comment_text": "A blank cartridge is almost as loud as a regular one.

I was thinking the part where you noticed that the normal shockwaves aren&#39;t forming on the subsonic bullet until it is a few inches out of the muzzle. It seems to me it has to do with the temperature of the gas coming out of the firearm. The sound speed in a fluid increases with the square root of its temperature. As the bullet moves from the hot exhaust gas to the cooler ambient air, the sound speed is dropping, so it doesn&#39;t actually enter a transonic flow regime until it reaches this point. It could also be affected by differences in some of the other properties of the gas that change as it moves into the room temperature air.

Leave the apologizing to the practitioners.  Scientist observe and collect data.  What that data is used for is not a scientists job, that goes to any practitioner such as engineers, doctors or politicians.  An example of this is when all of us are born and are young, we observe the world around us. Young humans collect data by testing and stressing ideas such as &quot; What if I push this spoon off of my tabletop, what will momma do?&quot;  And depending on Momma&#39;s reaction we have an idea, and if we continue to test and to push our spoon off of our tabletop and continue to see a repeating pattern of Momma&#39;s reaction we can eventually conclude a Theory.  A Theory in scientific terms is different in a hypothesis.  A theory is a test proven.  So if someone were to say &quot; someone has been stealing my lunch everyday this week&quot;  and then were to say &quot; I have a theory as to who&#39;m&quot;  can only say so if they actually have data collected of any means that with proof&#39;s have a convict. Most people when asked who they think stole their lunch will say something like &quot;I have a theory&quot; but what that really comes down to is a hunch, or someone they suspect.  All it means is an exaggeration of their own ethos and their own pushing of why they should be believed. ( the last two sentences were  of my own opinion).

I reload bullets and the unburnt powder thing is fascinating. There is a little space in the barrel of a rifle in front of the brass case neck where the projectile seats that doesn&#39;t have any riflings. Careful reloaders want to make this space as small as possible without actually touching the riflings so that there will be less &quot;jump&quot; as we call it, for more accuracy. Factories making bullets only care that the projectile isn&#39;t too long, so there is usually plenty of space in there with a factory load. Another thing that happens is that when a bullet is fired, the brass case expands slightly to match almost exactly the interior of the firing chamber. What is interesting to me is that (I guess) powder directly behind the bullet, being lighter than the bullet and feeling the effects of the building pressure sooner, must be slipping around the bullet while it&#39;s in that little space in front of the brass case neck.

The bullet has a &quot;large&quot; surface area for the gases to apply force. The rifle area has a tiny surface area having the same force applied to it. So like water out of a hose with your thumb over the end, the gases are pressing hard enough on the copper in the rifling that it&#39;s slinging them out faster than the bullet.<br><br>This is further demonstrated by the fact that we know gases leave the barrel first.

But then as the pressure drops and the air slows down, the bullet starts to actually push the air out of the way, accelerating it and generating the shocks. 2) The gas is initially very hot, which raises the local speed of sound such that no part of it reaches supersonic flow.

These videos are great and extraordinarily fascinating! I&#39;ve worked with Kyle of The Social Regressive youtube channel.

That was a moment to celebrate because we all thought that sound was fake when in fact you just don&#39;t hear it at close distance, but it is real! Soon after that test you posted &quot;Shockwave Shadows in Ultra Slow Motion (Bullet Schlieren).&quot; Kyle and I had a long chat about your video and our own tests. I know you couldn&#39;t hear it in your video, but thanks to your video we are pretty sure we know WHY the bullets make the &quot;pew&quot; sound when they do! These tests are consistent, repeatable, and <del>to a degree</del> predictable. We have since conducted more tests at extreme long ranges with a camera and microphone next to a one mile target. The supersonic projectile has gone through the transonic barrier and is subsonic when it hits the target.  There is still a loud &quot;crack&quot; from when the bullet was supersonic.  It&#39;s a SUPER interesting observation!  We&#39;ve been able to use the sound that we recorded to recalculate some of our ballistic data and make corrections that explain/verify why our dope adjustments were different from what was initially expected using the manufacturers ballistic data. There is certainly more to test and more to learn and understand. Kyle and I would really love to talk with you, compare notes, and see what more we can learn together. <br>To anyone else reading this would you please give it a like so hopefully Destin will see it.

I am not a gunner, or a fluid dynamics scientist, but in my mind, I explain it as follows:<br><br>Unburnt propellant is likely due to the propellant&#39;s burn rate to be slower (or lower? How do I compare that?) than the kinetic energy produced by the gas expansion caused by the burning propellant in this confined chamber. It is probably necessarily that way for the propellant to be able to accelerate the bullet to the desired speed: The energy it takes to accelerate the bullet and to press it into the riflings to target speed must be exceeded by the energy produced by the burning propellant. But not too much, otherwise the chamber explodes! So timing is of an essence, and dragging out the production of that propellant energy over time helps with preventing to construct overly reinforced explosion chambers. (I am not considering the additional energy required to eject the empty shell and chamber the next round.)<br><br>This I guess comes at a cost, in that there will be unburnt propellant simply because of laws of physics: The burn rate of the propellant, as in the speed and time with which it rips through the entire volume from the back where the pin hits the shell to ignite all the way to the front where the actual bullet sits, is likely less than the time required to accelerate some propellant to a speed that exceeds the burn progression - and accelerating little specs of propellant takes much less energy and time to accelerate the bullet itself, which has much more mass. Therefore I think there is a &quot;window of opportunity&quot; for propellant to slip past the bullet into the rifle bore before the bullet is pressed into the riflings, closing off the explosion chamber to maximise on the energy to propel the bullet forward. <br><br>The result would be the little propellant specks <b>plus</b> some explosion gases exiting the barrel before the actual projectile as seen in your video.<br><br>I would love to see footage of what is going on in the explosion chamber to see whether my ramblings have any resemblance with reality :-) Dustin, there is your next video topic. :-D", "comment_date": "2018-12-01T11:34:27Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "MrAdvantage1", "comment_text": "Super cucky opening statement \u201cI don\u2019t want to glorify weaponry\u201d<br><br>Guns are part of the American spirit.

What does that even look like? Hickcock45 or Demolition ranch? Are they &quot;glorifying weapons&quot; by showing people that shooting guns can be fun and safe? I just really feel like you sent the wrong message with the way you opened the video. There is nothing wrong with enjoying firearms, firearms are a tool. Just like a hammer it doesn&#39;t become a deadly weapon until you direct its force at another living thing, in that moment both hammer and firearm are weapons, but the second you put either one in its holster it goes right back to being a tool with a multitude of uses. So why the preface? Why not reiterate the safety precautions you and the crew are taking to show your respect for firearms, what they are capable of and how they are never toys?

He&#39;s really attracted to any kind of weapons but because he also didn&#39;t grow up in a culture, where people deal with weapons personally, he never learned to respect them. One time he just shot at a bird with an airgun and killed it. Only then he realised what he&#39;d done and regretted it afterwards.

And I totally agree that often it\u2019s videos of violent phenomena that provide the best visualisations of a range of physics. Since I\u2019m here, was interested if you could go into more depth some time about the interactions between bullets and solids. Some observations; in the bullet vs prince Rupert drop videos, there\u2019s a couple times where the PRD fails at the point where the bullet impacts, setting off the glass failure front. However, due to the massive frame rates you were filming you can see in a couple shots that a second failure occurs at the tail end and meets the initial fracture somewhere in the middle. This was interesting to me as I had originally thought that the fracture would travel at the speed of sound in glass, and that it would therefore be impossible for the tail end to \u2018know\u2019 the PRD had been hit before the fracture front reaches it. Since this isn\u2019t the case, it must be that on impact the bullet sets off a longitudinal wave which travels faster than the failure wave? Second observation, you attribute the light seen on impact with triboluminescence, which I thought makes sense, until I saw a different shot of a PRD which does not break on impact with the bullet, still exhibit light as the bullet breaks around it. The bullet can\u2019t exhibit triboluminescence as its not crystalline, so I think the light must be at least partially attributable to adiabatic compression of tiny trapped gas spaces between bullet and glass.

Since the speed of sound is proportional to the square root of the temperature, at a fixed bullet velocity, Mach number is increasing because the speed of sound is decreasing. It could be also due to the relative velocities: we can see unburnt powder traveling supersonic, meaning that there could be a a supersonic flow right at the end of the suppressor. So, speaking in terms of relative velocities, a subsonic bullet moving in a supersonic flow is actually moving backward with respect to the surrounding air but, as soon as the bullet reaches the outside environment, its relative velocity increases until its Mach number becomes critical, causing normal shockwaves.

This last pair of videos are among my favorite you&#39;ve ever done: this is groundbreaking footage depicting physical phenomena I never imagined I would directly observe like this. Please continue the firearms videos. As you suggested, they provide tremendous practical examples of all kinds of interesting things like mechanical engineering, physics, fluid dynamics, ballistics (internal, external/flight, terminal, etc.), and much more. I am so excited to be able to see the noise generated by rifles and bullets in motion, and how suppressors modify them. I may watch this footage over a hundred times. I want to learn and this is a tremendous resource that I&#39;m sure many students, informal and formal, will be referencing, as will professionals.<br><br>The fact that we can visualize the vibrations and movement of gasses and projectiles (including unburned powder) in such high resolution and slow motion just fills me with awe not only at what humanity has accomplished and the understanding it has gained but at what it will understand and accomplish as experiments and observations like this build and deepen our knowledge. Now that we have the ability to actually view and measure the report of a firearm not just in decibels but as a visualization of the mechanics of sound, I can only imagine that this sort of thing will be very useful to understanding the fluid dynamics and how to control them for desired effects like impulse noise reduction. Which could have the very practical effect of preventing a tremendous amount of hearing loss! Permanent hearing damage is one of the most common military injuries and is also a very common occurrence in civilian life.<br><br>That even subsonic bullets can produce supersonic effects is a revelation to me. It&#39;s one thing to read a few sentences describing what happens, and another to observe it with your own eyes. I have tremendous appreciation for your work to create visual demonstrations that actually show us science heretofore that we could only read and imagine with our own eyes. It&#39;s clearly a lot more sophisticated than we could imagine, which raises further questions, which leads to more knowledge and better understanding of the universe.

One point of clarification I would make is that I have probably fired over 100,000 suppressed rounds, including belt fed.
