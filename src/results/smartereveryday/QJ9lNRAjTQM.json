Now if you shake the balloon with the beads in it then the beads would move around and displace from their original position. Now if we consider this scenario with our own body, the result would fatal as the organs would be flying around everywhere even if we do simple movement. So our body adapts to this situation by attaching the organs to the abdomen. The way they attach is complex but in simple terms imagine pushing those beads into the balloon from outside, even though the beads are pushed from the outside they end up inside the balloon but with a layer of the rubber around them. This balloon is called as peritoneum. Occasionally due to trauma blood stars to leak from the abdominal organs. Due to the trauma this balloon might get damaged and the blood would start leaking into the balloon.

The punch in his stomach really had nothing to do with Houdini\u2019s death. Most scholars on Magic and Houdini recognize that Houdini was already having issues with his appendix. But he wasn\u2019t one to go and seek help. The punch to his stomach only gave him a reason to ignore the underlying issue. <br><br>By the time he was convinced to go to the hospital, it had already been some time after the punch. The main reason he went was because he could barely walk anymore, and collapsed after a show. <br><br>Now, the book you mentioned makes the claim he was poisoned. The reason being that after the surgery, he was starting to recover quickly. However, that all switched all at once and he died shortly after. So he had made a recovery, but after that recovery from a successful surgery, he all of a sudden turned deathly ill and passed away. <br><br>So no, it wasn\u2019t from a punch. The issue had been with his appendix and a punch will not make your appendix burst. At most, the punch just gave him an excuse to not see the doctors as he could rationalize the pain.

There is only 1 Person who defeated death, and that is Jesus Christ. Since Adam only One rose from the dead and it was not harry houdini. Only in Jesus Christ is eternal life, that is the truth. Don&#39;t be deceived by magicians and illusionists, they can do alot.. but eventually, they will die and perish like the rest of us. Life is not a game, and it does not end after death. In Jesus Christ is forgiveness of sin and true eternal life, it&#39;s not a joke and not a fairytale, not a trick or a play of emotions. He DID rise from the dead, and there were over 500 witnesses of that fact! What no human being ever could do, Jesus Christ did and if we believe in Him, we will share in that Life forever with Him.. Romans 10:9 That if thou shalt confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus, and shalt believe in thine heart that God hath raised him from the dead, thou shalt be saved. Come today sinners, the consequence of our sin is death, that is the punishment and the ultimate proof we are indeed dust and ashes, we all die! But there is forgiveness and eternal life in only One Man, believe today and receive eternal life I beg you. 2 Corinthians <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QJ9lNRAjTQM&amp;t=5m20s\">5:20</a> Now then we are ambassadors for Christ, as though God did beseech you by us: we pray you in Christ&#39;s stead, be ye reconciled to God.

In his final days, he optimistically held to a strong belief that he would recover, but his last words before dying were reportedly, &quot;I&#39;m tired of fighting.&quot;[18] Eyewitnesses to an incident at Houdini&#39;s dressing room in the Princess Theatre in Montreal gave rise to speculation that Houdini&#39;s death was caused by a McGill University student, J. Gordon Whitehead, who delivered a surprise attack of multiple blows to Houdini&#39;s abdomen.[70]<br><br>The eyewitnesses, students named Jacques Price and Sam Smilovitz (sometimes called Jack Price and Sam Smiley), proffered accounts of the incident that generally corroborated one another. Price describes Whitehead asking Houdini &quot;if he believed in the miracles of the Bible&quot; and &quot;whether it was true that punches in the stomach did not hurt him&quot;. He then delivered &quot;some very hammer-like blows below the belt&quot;. Houdini was reclining on a couch at the time, having broken his ankle while performing several days earlier. Price states that Houdini winced at each blow and stopped Whitehead suddenly in the midst of a punch, gesturing that he had had enough, and adding that he had had no opportunity to prepare himself against the blows, as he did not expect Whitehead to strike him so suddenly and forcefully. Had his ankle not been broken, he would have risen from the couch into a better position to brace himself.[70][71]<br><br>Throughout the evening, Houdini performed in great pain. He was unable to sleep and remained in constant pain for the next two days, but did not seek medical help. When he finally saw a doctor, he was found to have a fever of 102 \u00b0F (39 \u00b0C) and acute appendicitis, and advised to have immediate surgery. He ignored the advice and decided to go on with the show.[72][73] When Houdini arrived at the Garrick Theater in Detroit, Michigan, on October 24, 1926, for what would be his last performance, he had a fever of 104 \u00b0F (40 \u00b0C). Despite the diagnosis, Houdini took the stage. He was reported to have passed out during the show, but was revived and continued. Afterwards, he was hospitalized at Detroit&#39;s Grace Hospital.[70]<br><br>It is not entirely clear what relationship the encounter in the dressing room had on Houdini&#39;s eventual death.[70] As Snopes points out, the relationship between blunt trauma and appendicitis is not clear. One theory suggests that Houdini was unaware that he was suffering from appendicitis. If he had not realized that his stomach pains were symptomatic of appendicitis, he would not have appreciated the potentially critical effect of the blows to his abdomen.[70]<br><br>After taking statements from Price and Smilovitz, Houdini&#39;s insurance company concluded that the death was due to the dressing-room incident and paid double indemnity.[72]", "comment_date": "2015-06-19T14:53:48Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Nikki Snd", "comment_text": "schwab, schwab, schwabschwabiduba. schwab, schwab, schwabschwabiduba.", "comment_date": "2015-06-18T13:54:08Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Kim Schmider", "comment_text": "Why do I hear so much about Taekwondo, since I started doing it?", "comment_date": "2015-06-17T16:42:08Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "gigicaly", "comment_text": "lol you almost broke your arm there man... jessus dude pickup a sport, boxing or martial arts or something before you actually get in a situation where you really need to throw a punch :)....<br><br><br>never mind lol looks like you went to pickup a lesson from experts :)", "comment_date": "2015-06-17T16:20:12Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Morgan L", "comment_text": "\ud83d\ude2c", "comment_date": "2015-06-17T00:58:32Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Rishabh", "comment_text": "Ginger HAHA!", "comment_date": "2015-06-16T16:16:21Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Galaxy Lps", "comment_text": "Omg I live in BAMA XD", "comment_date": "2015-06-16T02:34:55Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "WV591", "comment_text": "It was a perfect murder by a person working for seance groups. punched while unprepared.", "comment_date": "2015-06-15T23:53:49Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "whattehjeff", "comment_text": "RIP Destin&#39;s wrist after that punch", "comment_date": "2015-06-15T20:56:47Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "wadap bois", "comment_text": "he wasn&#39;t readyyyy", "comment_date": "2015-06-14T07:14:17Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "VforDyslexia", "comment_text": "Whispers &quot; brutality&quot;.               <b>slinks back into the depths of the Internet</b>", "comment_date": "2015-06-14T02:50:40Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Vojak3", "comment_text": "Only Jews do that thing with the stone.

And it&#39;s annoying, it&#39;s not something that pops up only once saying &quot;This is the new way to identify yourself on YouTube <b>Completely Optional</b>&quot;. Noope.

Goddammit. Anyway these identity things make me feel like I have to prove myself to society more or something with that lame new ID picture we have next to our usernames when we comment on videos.

Youtube is where we just want to be slobs and get distracted from watching science videos for school and watching dumb (but adorable) cat videos for three hours instead. Youtube is where we look something up on our iPhones when we&#39;re having debates with our friends about what the lyrics of a song are or which crappy 90&#39;s band&#39;s lead singer vomited at the 1996 Superbowl halftime concert. (Youtube is like the = to Wikipedia for proving things in social situations sometimes.) I...I just...don&#39;t want to connect to people in the YouTube comments personally ight? It&#39;s supposed to be a lazy, anonymous, and convienient way to share personal comments. Why do we suddenly need to be exchanging more information about ourselves randomly by &quot;connecting to facebook&quot; or &quot;sharing on Google+&quot;?!?! Just let Youtube be what made it magical when it first started: it was a way for people to create and consume original content and exchange feedback, responses, comments, and ideas as simply thoughts and personalities instead of revealing the person, the personal identity behind the online anonymity of people&#39;s pure personalities.
