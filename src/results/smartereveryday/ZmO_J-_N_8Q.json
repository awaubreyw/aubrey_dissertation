I use the term &quot;murkiness&quot; for lack of a better word; can you see how cloudy it is?<br>Now take note of the stress fractures (cracks) and compare them to the &quot;murkiness&quot;; notice they have nothing to do with one another. The &quot;cracks&quot; extend multiple different directions and in some instances far beyond the &quot;murkiness&quot;.<br>These &quot;cracks&quot; you are seeing are caused by the acrylic separating from itself whereas the &quot;murkiness&quot; is caused by the separation of the rigid acrylic, from the the flexible polycarbonate. More specifically its actually the glue loosing its bond and deforming, this causes refractions and makes it loose its optical transparency.<br>Its the difference between &quot;cracking&quot; in the Xy, Xz and Yz axis. (This of course changes based on your point of view and orientation of the plate but if you read to this point I think you get what I&#39;m saying.)<br><br>How else could I explain it?...  Everyone knows what a mach cone looks like right? Well imagine the mach cone is sand (from crushed acrylic); The bullet is going to transmit its energy into the sand surrounding it, dragging it along as it plows its way into the polycarbonate (essentially fluid dynamics). Also remember that the lead bullet is physically deforming, mushrooming; pancaking if you would. All of this. combined with drag is enough to slow it down to a point where the polycarbonate can flex and act as a sort of catchers mitt. It literally bends and warps to contain the remaining energy. Its awesome.<br><br>Its the difference between 467 joules of being concentrated on a single point at the tip of the bullet versus spread out over say a nickel-quarter sized area (life and death). This stuff is sort of like tank armour except tanks use ceramic and steel which leaves them vulnerable to HESH rounds (High impact squash head) (basically it turns the tanks armour into deadly shrapnel in the form of spall) (not to be confused with spatter). Hopefully some or most of you know what I&#39;m talking about cause I&#39;m getting tired of writing and am way off topic now but it does lead me to ask the question: why are the inside of tanks not lined with Kevlar; or are they?", "comment_date": "2020-12-21T16:22:37Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "\u23ea  \uc544\ud750\uba54\ub4dc  \ud83c\udd70\ufe0f", "comment_text": "<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZmO_J-_N_8Q&amp;t=4m12s\">4:12</a> What is your name this gun please", "comment_date": "2020-12-21T16:16:26Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Billi Thoumilli", "comment_text": "That was crazy.

How did you manage to do that without completely destroying the glass with 50 cal as previously showed in the video? Does the distance matter? My second thought was what happens if you set the same glass on the same mount (which all have their own levels of flexibility) so close to 50 cal gun that it almost touches it at 90 degrees angle? I&#39;m guessing that in theory speed of the bullet would be the fastest, so it should go through the glass without breaking its square shape, but what about sound and shock waves? Would they push the glass away from the gun before the bullet hits it, so the glass wont sit at 90 degrees in relation to the gun and then cause the bullet to run at an angle causing the whole glass to break? Sorry for so many questions, I was mainly interested in shock and sound waves having an effect on the shot.

Then I thought maybe it would be the wind. I don&#39;t know for sure, but I don&#39;t see how a 50 caliber bullet wouldn&#39;t go super sonic, so maybe due to the nature of super sonic rounds the acrylic breaks the rest of the way from the force of the air wave catching up to the bullet and the cracks that the bullet left in the acrylic weakened it enough that that wind was enough to break it the rest of the way.

I&#39;m guessing the force for the split came from thermal expansion. As the round went through it may have heated a thin layer to the point of softening it. But as the heat spread maybe it caused sub-softening temperatures in a larger amount of material, thus causing the biggest cracks to spread.

I think there is more going on here.  During contact, the point of maximum stress actually occurs below the surface, this partially explains the lack of damage.  However we need to think more about the types of stress.  Where the bullet first contact the major stress will be compression (not likely to cause fracture), surrounding this there is an area governed by shear stresses (Mescall zone, likely to cause fracture), further below this is a zone of tensile stress.  I assume there will also be more shearing stresses at the edge of the bullet, compared to the center.<br><br>For a source check out: Shockey, D., J. Simons, and D. Curran. 2010. The damage mechanism route to better armor materials.

Who buried the dead, usually always some one you love. Death means many things to different people. Poking. In Star Wars, who was it that broke peace, the dark side of a religion. A, man? Look at all the other animals. What if Jar Jar saw dark side the first time he met a Jedi, he was to break the fourth wall. No. He just doesn\u2019t know so good, but he knows all Jedi have dark side, even we do. To wield a dark power such as .50 cal weapon requires. I got airsoft weapons.

No explanation as to why this is but my best guess is the force propagates backward, causing the back of the bullet to break first.

That brings up a question of what kind of elasticity does the material the &#39;glass&#39; is made of have? Is it several layers of laminated glass together? Some kind of acrylic? I&#39;m hypothesizing that when the 9mm impacted it created a compression perpendicular to the point of impact but did not actually break the glass, however the energy being redirected into the shock of that &#39;cone&#39; then fractured the glass around it leaving the impact sight untouched. Or the bullet was simply unable to overcome a friction barrier at the surface and when the lead shredded on impact the burred edges dug out the circular crater . OR if it&#39;s a laminate material was that impact sight a cleared section of the next layer down?
