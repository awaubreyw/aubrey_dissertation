If the Soyuz performs a posigrade burn, it&#39;s velocity increases doesn&#39;t it? Because a force is applied and this results in acceleration along the tangential direction. And with acceleration comes an increase in velocity. Am I right up till here?<br>Yet at the same time, this increases its orbit into an elliptical one. And after the two burns of the Hohmann Transfer, it would have a wider circular orbit and a higher velocity than before. So overall, the velocity increases and it has a wider orbit. So I&#39;m confused because based on the equations I learnt from Gravitation and Circular Motion, what I got was that if the radius increases, it&#39;s velocity is suppose to increase.<br>Is anybody able to clarify this doubt of mine, thanks in advance! :)", "comment_date": "2015-07-19T04:02:30Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "GalaXy808", "comment_text": "Wow!

The orbital velocity on circular orbits reduces as the radius of the orbit increases. That means that not only does a ship on higher orbit lag behind a ship on lower orbit because it must cover a greater distance, it also actually travels at slower orbital velocity.<br><br>This is because the gravitational pull - centripetal force that keeps the spacecraft on the circular orbit - is inversely proportional to the square of radius, and that simply means you don&#39;t need to go quite as fast to follow Earth&#39;s curvature as you&#39;re falling through space.<br><br>Here&#39;s a nice applet that lets you experiment with different altitudes for circular orbits: <a href=\"http://hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu/hbase/orbv3.html\">http://hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu/hbase/orbv3.html</a><br><br>But the core idea of synchronizing orbits was portrayed well enough, I guess - if you need to catch up to your target, you need to slow down (burn retrograde) to drop to a lower orbit, where you&#39;ll be traveling faster... and if you need to allow your target to catch up with you, you must first go away from the target (prograde burn) to lift yourself to higher orbit which will allow you to orbit the Earth slower than your target.<br><br>Although, before setting up an intersect and rendezvous, you&#39;d have to make sure that the orbits also have the correct inclination - which means they must orbit Earth in the same reference plane. This is actually why launch windows exist - the orbit of the target (ISS in this case) must be over the launch site, or close enough that the launch vehicle will be able to match the planes during ascent or the orbital burns.", "comment_date": "2015-03-24T17:12:00Z", "likes_count": 4}, {"comment_by": "Zenon Hrabowsky", "comment_text": "If you enjoyed the flight portion of this video look up the game kerbal space program.
