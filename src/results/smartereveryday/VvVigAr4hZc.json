I&#39;m 19, and I fell in love with your channel ages and ages ago. Science to me isn&#39;t understanding the knowledge, it&#39;s being able to apply said knowledge years, maybe decades or centuries after it&#39;s first discovery, into something useful for society. When I need to hear a big word, or watch an adventure into some crazy deal involving digging up opals in the middle of the Australian outback, or a discussion on how Astronauts maintain bone density and muscle mass, I go to you or Derek at Veritasium, maybe Vsauce too if I feel for something meta.<br>I&#39;ll be honest, astronomy is what I am hooked on. Mainly with Quark Stars. The second big thing I feel is engineering, aerospace engineering in particular. Like with the holes in the ISS. I love the idea of building a machine that could assist with some life challenge microgravity can cause, then taking the design and modifying it, slowly shrinking it down and making it more compact and lighter weight. If I could stand in your shoes on one of these adventures, I&#39;d be the happiest fish in the ocean.<br>But I have two questions for you today. One personal, and one scientific.<br>To an outside observer, science is several different branches of the same tree. Physics and biology are not the same. However, they heavily, and I mean HEAVILY depend upon each other and alter factors of the other. Where do you think the split between two branches exists, or is it like a sponge, all one thing but with pockets of ignorance and some areas blending together in some fourth dimensional scientific love fest?<br>Secondly, I wanted to ask more upon your religious beliefs. You have many more years on life than I do, and we have come to polarized opinions on this topic. I am not a believer of the Bible or any other religious text. In short, I&#39;m an atheist. To me this makes logical sense and has altered many relationships.

Bacon", "comment_text": "no one can prove nor disprove the existence of god...a book written by people is not proof...seeing how intelligent you are, how can you be christian? The whole religion is based on a book which has been written and rewritten, translated...many gospels were omitted...why? Why don&#39;t you do an episode on how the bible provides credible evidence to the existence of god. I&#39;m not trying to be rude here...I don&#39;t claim that god doesn&#39;t exist, that claim cannot logically be made...but the same logic applies in the opposite direction. If faith helps people sleep...good....but people with proper logic and reasoning skills should have some doubts, as I do. I think quantum physics and cosmology explain our origins far better than an ancient text written by people. I believe the earth is some kind of petri dish, created by god knows who...a simple example would be miracles...i assume most amputees pray that they had a full body like most people...how come god hasn&#39;t granted any amputee a limb? Organized religion makes no sense in eyes of a reasonable person. The answer to the question &quot;does god exist?&quot; is &quot;no one knows&quot; or &quot;there is no way of finding out&quot;. Just like ants cannot comprehend our existence, we may be the ants unable to comprehend the existence of something higher...claiming that a book explains it all is just silly.", "comment_date": "2015-12-25T19:46:15Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Lifeisawheelie", "comment_text": "Bravo", "comment_date": "2015-12-25T19:43:55Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "phooogle", "comment_text": "Your wife is beautiful.<br>Thanks", "comment_date": "2015-12-25T19:42:34Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "SiMyt848", "comment_text": "this video is so kind and nice!", "comment_date": "2015-12-25T19:39:12Z", "likes_count": 3}, {"comment_by": "katinjegat", "comment_text": "She&#39;s so cute!", "comment_date": "2015-12-25T19:39:03Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "snaprollinpitts", "comment_text": "Merry Christmas, Dustin!!!", "comment_date": "2015-12-25T19:38:27Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "innerlocus", "comment_text": "<i>Merry Winter Solstice</i> <br>for the atheist in all of us\u2026", "comment_date": "2015-12-25T19:38:07Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "William Ross", "comment_text": "Holy shit Destin.
