From what my mom told me, it was fairly common to put on your skates, go to tighten them down, and suddenly realize you lost your key! She told me the key was super easy to lose, and it would fall off its leather strap, or it get set down on the ground and left, or just fall out of her pocket at some point. So you would end up going to get a skate key, or asking someone to use their key.<br><br>This puts some context on the part &quot;you&#39;ve got something i need. i&#39;ve got a brand new pair of roller skates, you&#39;ve got a brand new key. i think that we should get together and try them out to see.&quot; It&#39;s a sly way to try and trick someone into spending time with you. I think its especially sly in this song&#39;s story because the skates are brand new, which implies the singer would certainly have the key that came with them and didn&#39;t need a new one.<br><br>I feel like this song will make less and less sense as time goes on and history forgets why you&#39;d ever need a key for new roller skates lol", "comment_date": "2021-10-27T10:17:21Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Micah Ramsey", "comment_text": "Fun!
