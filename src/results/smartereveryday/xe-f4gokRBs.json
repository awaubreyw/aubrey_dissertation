Then the energy explodes the outer shell. Since the energy is able to expand down the long tail as fast as the vibration (heat wave?) can move down the shell which is over 100,000 frames per second, the energy hits the end of the expansion, swells, and explodes the glass. Kinda the same principle as squirting a regular water hose where the outside tension strength hold the stream until it can expand at a certain distance due the the stretching of the water and the power behind the stream.  I wonder how long the tail can get and this still works? It seems indefinitely until the power of the energy slows due to expansion?.

Water cannot go higher than 212.<br>When the molten glass drops into the water, the heat of the glass cannot be absorbed by the water (can&#39;t go over 212)... the heat is forced out the tail... this creates a &quot;phase shift&quot; of heat energy to pressure and sound to get the &quot;heat energy&quot; out as quickly as possible. The point in the tail... is the phase shifting point. When the glass cools that point is sealed. There is a lack of pressure through the &quot;sound harmonics&quot; of energy. Glass is special in that it will reflect anything not on the other side. The Rupert&#39;s Drop  having phase shifted the heat to pressure and sound, has drastically less than on the outside. The &quot;magic glass&quot; reflects the pressure through the sound harmonic. If you strike the Rupert&#39;s Drop hard enough to make a spark (a phase shift of pressure to light to expend excess kinetic energy)... it will pop the rupert&#39;s drop.

Construct cylinder for molten drop to free fall into until fully solidified.<br>     a. The diameter of this cylinder should be slightly double that of the maximum range diameter of the solidified drop.<br>     b. Thus 8 to 10 inches in diameter in order to make sure the volume within the cylinder remains efficient.<br>     c. The height of the cylinder must be in linear proportion to the time that:<br>                i. Gravity.<br>                ii. Heat of molten drop.<br>                iii. Solidification time for acquiring solidified drop.<br>          in order for the molten drop to be solidified in a constant free-fall state for optimal molecular structure solidification.<br>2. Fill chamber with a highly purified cooling agent.<br>      a. Cooling agent can have high or low friction frequencies upon molten drop.<br>                i. High friction frequency incurs shorter free-fall distance.<br>                ii. Low friction frequency incurs longer free-fall distance.<br>       b. Cooling agent should be highly purified.<br>                i. low purification incurs increased variations in molecular solidification structure process.<br>                ii. high purification incurs decreased variations in molecular solidification structure process.<br>       c. Temperature of cooling agent should be very low.<br>                i. If cooling agent is too hot, the molecular solidification process will have to travel through to much time and space<br>                ii. If cooling agent is very cold, the molecular solidification process will allow for faster atomic bonding to incur, <br>                           thus allowing for optimal atomic stacking within fused structure.<br>3. Limit the air-time duration from furnace to cylindrical cooling chamber.<br>        a. Minimizing the travel time the molten drop undertakes allows the molten drop to solidify with greater time in the cooling agent.<br>        b. The air outside the furnace instantly starts to act as a cooling agent when the molten drop leaves exits.<br>        c. This outside air could have inconsistencies the can incur unwanted variations in the molecular solidification process.<br>4. Optimize the Drop Process:<br>         a. Allow as much of the molten drops consistency to fall at the front.<br>                i. Having too long of a tail can incur increased variations in molecular solidification.<br>                ii. Having too long of a tail may induce unwanted curling, increasing the brittle factors of structure.<br>                iii. Allowing the bulk of the mass of the glass at the front, will allow most of the atomic stacking to be focused on the nose cone.<br>          b. Insure that the molten drop is done nearest to the center-point of the cylindrical cooling agent.<br>                i. Due to the molecular stacking of the cooling agent within the cylinder:<br>                        ia. The center-point allows for equal pressure distributions,\u00a0<br>                                  (according to Archimede&#39;s Principle),<br>                                  upon both the object being immersed, and the fluid body within the cylinder chamber.<br>5. Variations in length and width of solidified Drop:<br>          a. A shorter length, and wider width, for the solidified drop.<br>          b. A longer length, and narrower width, for the solidified drop.<br>          c. Each variation can have proportional advantages and disadvantages for a given durability test.<br>6.

What makes this so tough is the balance between tensive force on the inside and compressive force on the outside,  when the tail breaks the balance is broken. <br>Sorry about the long comment , heres a potato @@", "comment_date": "2019-08-22T17:06:17Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "telo tawa", "comment_text": "what if you dropped a near perfect sphere of molten glass into water?", "comment_date": "2019-08-22T03:39:46Z", "likes_count": 3}, {"comment_by": "TechNoir", "comment_text": "Destin!

Anyway, I was drilling a rear side window to put a hole in it with a brass tube and some valve grinding compound to mount it PERMANENTLY to the closure mechanism, because the glue was always failing after a few months to a year, and I was almost all the way through it, so I slowed down the drilling rate to come out the back side gently.  Well...it wasn&#39;t gentle enough, because it shattered, some of it ending up all the way across the garage (two car).  Also, I had a red streak across my abdomen, which obviously took up the pretty serious amount of energy stored up in that safety glass.  I was pretty amazed at how much energy there was, I would estimate quite a bit more than that drop.  It, also, sounded pretty much instantaneous as it went.  Might be interesting to high speed film one, but do it behind a safety shield.  I don&#39;t think that energy would be much of an issue with the glass breaking in the frame, because it all seemed to be longitudinal in the glass, so the frame would take most of the hit.", "comment_date": "2019-01-14T22:36:20Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Thunderbolt", "comment_text": "Just amazing", "comment_date": "2019-01-13T21:27:52Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Emanuel Neff", "comment_text": "Is it possible to make a perfectly round one that has no weak point?", "comment_date": "2019-01-13T18:09:14Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Or\u00e7un \u00d6zcan", "comment_text": "fazla emek vermi\u015fsin", "comment_date": "2019-01-11T14:35:28Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "BaddaBigBoom", "comment_text": "See Rock City ;-)", "comment_date": "2019-01-10T23:41:46Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "bowieinc", "comment_text": "Looks like a Rupert\u2019s drop breaks faster that regular plated glass?

I think there is an analogy here to prestressed concrete, in which the cables apply a huge compressive residual stress, so that the only effect of what would normally be destructive tensile forces applied to the concrete, only serves to reduce the existing compression.  The member is able to fail only if  the tensile force is huge enough to overcome the huge residual compressive strain.<br>I suspect that research into the tail and where it becomes critical would reveal manufacturing options.

So it you sit still you are always technically &quot;moving through time&quot; because everything that is moving is therefore changing its relative position with respect to you. In this case, as the flash cooling occurs, the process captures and stores not only the curvature of the space, but the interrupted acceleration means that the potential energy is in the process of INCREASING as it enters the cold medium, and when it impacts the liquid medium, it would otherwise be dispersed in radial waves or ripples, meaning it would not simply cause an impact crater like a meteor or other generally solid impacts cause.... this impact would have created a depression during the impact, but that depression would created sonic burst, think about when someone does a cannon ball, or better yet, take a bucket of water, lift it up and flip it upside down and throw the water down in to your pool or whatever.. you will find that if you do it right, it will literally make your ears ring, like being too close to a sonic boom. this is the energy that is being trapped here. this is fascinating. I can&#39;t believe this is on youtube and we still wonder &quot;how do we warp space time?&quot;. this is it folks. this is what the &quot;aliens&quot; do, it is why their ships have a strikingly consistent M-O.

When making the drops for shooting; have another person holding sheers just above the water tank and sheer off the long tail. this way you can shoot it and possibly NOT cause the tip of the tail to snap.     2. After sheering the tail off - support the drop in some kind of silicon jell with only the round head of the drop exposed to the bullet.   reducing the tail and holding more firmly than a string may allow more bullets to be deflected.

Then because of the tension stress in the glass they accelerate and bifocate again.\nIn normal tempered glass the stress is less, the acceleration slower and the break pattern is bigger.", "comment_date": "2013-05-06T08:59:42Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Samuel Liebermann", "comment_text": "So why does it explode and not implode?", "comment_date": "2013-05-06T06:50:03Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Floppyoneactual", "comment_text": "Dude!
