[{"comment_by": "SmarterEveryDay", "comment_text": "Our Social Media Platforms are under attack.  Twitter is being hit with systematic external attacks in the form of meta-manipulation and inauthentic users who attempt to shape the discussion by slowly and methodically radicalizing people.  These attackers have demonstrated the desire to promote tribalism and the &quot;us&quot; vs &quot;them&quot; mentality.  I propose proactive unity as a countermeasure.  <br><br>It&#39;s kind of interesting how crazy typing a sentence like that makes a person sound... but it&#39;s absolutely true.<br><br>My twitter accounts are here (open in new tab?):<br><a href=\"http://www.smartereveryday.com/twitter\">http://www.smartereveryday.com/twitter</a><br>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br>For those commenting on Twitter having a political agenda:<br>I&#39;ve read the same articles and listened to the same podcast episodes you have on this subject.... and I&#39;ve concluded that I seem to take a more nuanced perspective on this than others.<br><br><br>Whenever I hear about an individual ban/suspension/censorship, the first thing I do is read about the context of the ban.  I then divide them into 2 groups.  <br><br><br>*Group 1 Suspensions: Bans based off of Twitter&#39;s values and policy decisions. *<br>In this case it&#39;s clear to me a human actively makes a decision to ban someone, or a specific keyword or phrase etc.  I agree that several of their policies (banning certain words, phrases, or &quot;protecting&quot; certain groups but not others) should be discussed and debated openly.  In case you&#39;re not detecting my stance on this I&#39;ll spell it out...  I have very strong feelings about these things but I&#39;m avoiding disclosing how I feel in order to shine more light on Group 2 suspensions, which are the result of a far more technical threat.  Group 1 Suspensions could be changed tomorrow if certain people change their mind..  Group 2 could not.<br><br><br><b>Group 2 Suspensions. Bans/Suspensions taking place because Twitter is trying to fight literal armies trying to manipulate our society.</b><br>I&#39;m finding my attention drawn more to this group more because the attackers&#39; intentions here are so malicious.  While doing research for this video, I found that the majority of the inauthentic behavior is focused on content meant to align with the right.  This make people on the left think &quot;those people on the right&quot; are more radicalized than reality thus making them retreat further left.  Those on the right are also in danger of being pushed further right.  The &quot;Us&quot; vs &quot;Them&quot; thinking starts immediately.  The play here is subtle, and quite frankly, this is a very intelligent way to attack us.  <b>The dataset Twitter released has more right leaning accounts than left.</b> (Look for yourself, here&#39;s a spreadsheet URLs to the WayBack machine for each username in that dataset. The Wayback machine didn&#39;t image all pages: <a href=\"http://bit.ly/WaybackTrolls\">http://bit.ly/WaybackTrolls</a> ) .One of the interesting problems that Twitter has, is that BECAUSE the majority of the malicious content is built to look like the political viewpoints from one side, they must test their countermeasure algorithms against inauthentic content that also seems to be authentic content on the right.  As a result of the target set being unquestionably biased, I would expect disproportionate amount of &quot;collateral damage&quot; flaggings to be on the right.<br><br><br>Whenever I see someone who has been suspended, I try to be intellectually honest and read their complaints and run it through my engineer filter.  If they seem emotional, I try to identify what types of emotions are being communicated and use that to figure out what category the ban fits in.  <br><br><br>Group 1 Bans are usually pretty clear.  These bans are usually a process, not a single event.  Still, these victims feel that their speech is being controlled (and by definition it is) so they&#39;re usually angry.<br>Group 2 Bans are often collateral damage, so the sense of injustice is elevated.  From what I can tell, Twitter doesn&#39;t provide indicate that the suspension was automatic, therefore the user is forced to assume they have crossed some type of ideological barrier and therefore been deemed &quot;not politially correct&quot;.  The anger in this case usually has a tiny dash of confusion mixed in.  <br><br><br>Twitter usually tries to explain that it&#39;s a result of automatic filtering.... but without the context of what&#39;s going on in this episode,  victims of group 2 bans are left to logically assume a political agenda on the part of twitter.   They are assume they are the victim of a Group 1 ban.  I do not think this is always the case.<br><br><br>Heightened emotions lead Group 2 ban victims to tell as many people about the injustices at Twitter, often as loudly as possible.  I&#39;ve noticed when Twitter is notified (as recently happened with the movie &quot;Unplanned&quot; ) the suspension is reversed immediately, followed by a statement by Twitter explaining that the suspension was the result of an autonomous system.  To the victim, this explanation is insufficient, and they continue to think Twitter actually wanted to silence them.  In the cases I&#39;ve read, the victims sometime think that because they yelled loud enough the decision was reversed because they publicly shamed Twitter.  <br><br><br>The implications of this are pretty big for Twitter.  The result of all this confusion is that the public ends up thinking Twitter&#39;s efforts to &quot;control&quot; things are much lager than they actually are.  I think it&#39;s a good idea for Twitter to be more transparent about this stuff, and Del said they&#39;re moving in that direction which is great.  For the record, Twitter was 100% open with me and didn&#39;t restrict my message in any way.<br><br><br>Because these issues are related to countermeasures,  Twitter&#39;s sometimes not at liberty to discuss what exactly triggered their system, because knowledge of such systems could lead to exploitation.  <br>I&#39;m personally empathetic because I recognize Twitter is fighting a war.<br><br><br>......I also think free speech is awesome.", "comment_date": "2019-04-08T16:56:51Z", "likes_count": 910}, {"comment_by": "Tony Ortega", "comment_text": "i like how they slowly relax into &quot;yes it takes a lot of work to control the public&#39;s access to information&quot;", "comment_date": "2022-09-01T17:52:28Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Tony Ortega", "comment_text": "Yoel literally chose to wear the shirt with the symbol and colors of white nationalist neo nazism, but i digress..", "comment_date": "2022-09-01T17:45:45Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Tony Ortega", "comment_text": "&quot;malicious content&quot; I wonder if the definition of malicious is anything that goes against their terms of service which are based on their definition of malicious which is defined as anything that goes against their terms of service...and so on and so on, until they&#39;ve killed every last non-muslim on the planet.", "comment_date": "2022-09-01T17:43:52Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Tony Ortega", "comment_text": "This is the most awesome thing.

These videos are much more about human nature than I would have ever guessed. I&#39;d been railing for ages against the idea that people&#39;s opinions, especially political ones, have become a way we define who we are, rather than voting just being a task we occasionally do. I really thought the reason why was primarily leadership based; that in an effort to collect votes, politicians would make how you vote become a part of you that you&#39;d emotionally defend. I&#39;m realizing after watching this that, as much as that&#39;s still true, it may not even be the main reason.

Young people are more adept at using any kind of technology, including social media, as they&#39;ve essentially been around it their whole lives.

That position comes with a lot of influence, automatically. No different than other powers the President has at his disposal. We have checks and balances for the powers of a President. We currently have none for the President&#39;s newfound power of mass media and we are seeing the results of a President using this new power indiscriminately and/or for ill purpose.<br><br>In fact, I believe that anyone that has influence needs to carefully consider what they are publishing. <br><br>We have entire areas of law (the US Constitution, libel laws, fraud, election campaign laws, etc.) around publishing information, spreading lies, etc. We probably need to create new laws around what you are talking about, laws that extend these laws to the Internet and mass media. <br><br>I believe laws, oversight and regulations have definitely NOT kept up with technology. Our reality, everyone having a phone, everyone being tracked, everyone being videoed, the Internet, mass media, etc., etc., has changed in profound ways. Yet, we really haven&#39;t kept pace with laws, regulation, oversight (with &quot;teeth&quot; ie investigation/prosecution). And we need to do so. <br><br>For example, during the Great Depression, we had bank robbers who were &quot;interstate.&quot; As long as they made it out of a certain jurisdiction, they were often free and clear. The FBI was created for this (and other) reasons. It was recognized that this was a new breed of criminal for which current law enforcement was ill-equipped to handle. In fact, it was often lethal for traditional local law enforcement to try and apprehend these new criminals.  Thus, we created, or started to create, laws, policies, regulation, oversight, etc. to deal with interstate crime. Europe did something similar with Interpol.  <br><br>And if I am publishing artificial, or fake news, and YouTube is paying me through monetization? I&#39;m pretty sure that&#39;s some kind of fraud. When someone SWAT&#39;s someone, that&#39;s at least attempted murder as people have died as a consequence of SWAT-ing. But we really don&#39;t have laws on the books to deal with these new phenomena (SWAT-ing, Doxing, Internet Harassment, etc.) Look at Wikipedia and all the problems they have, it is like a microcosm for what I am saying. <br><br>The laws, gov agencies, regulation of businesses involved in everything the above video is talking about, needs to be updated, created, evolved to account for this.

I&#39;ve seen it happen so often online where I&#39;ll see news articles, youtube videos, or pretty much anything online posting about how group X is bad or group Y is causing a divide and I&#39;ll start to see these ideas emulated by people in real life and online. <br><br>It&#39;s sad how people get easily manipulated. I distinctly remember the time when I first started working as a bus monitor during college how the older people initially thought I was going to be some phone obsessed selfish narcissist because they heard all over Facebook and the news that is what the young generation is like. But after getting to know me better and I listen to them, and they listen to me how I&#39;m just a human like them. I don&#39;t like this growing sentiment of anger and confusion online that I started seeing early 2010s. Before I started college I used to think I was going to be surrounded by extremely vocal activists and political discourse since I saw so many stories online. Then when I actually started going to college I realized that people just show up to campus, take their classes, then leave (at least where I&#39;m from). That&#39;s when I losing trust in the news as a whole, it could be true, it could be false, I don&#39;t know anymore. <br><br><br><br>I just keep to myself and learn about new things in science, computers, or whatever without worrying about knowing 24/7 whats going on in the world; since in the end does it really matter? There is so much more to life than to argue with people about politics or social issues, I just live life as happy as I can so I can die happy, not die angry at the world. If someone holds a different world view than me that I don&#39;t agree with I can still talk to them as a human being, so what if they differ in social/political issues with me? That either means I can have a more interesting conversation with a viewpoint I never thought about or we can ignore topics we disagree on and move on.

And if the Beatles or Frank Sinatra and Twitter coincided in time and space, I would also ignore them too, but their popularity wouldn&#39;t bother me whatsoever.  Since Twitter is storing everything we put into it at the Library of Congress, so they claimed way back when they started, why do they want to do anything but wind it up and let it go?  It&#39;s quite odd that as teeny-tiny as my accounts are, Twitter oddly keeps dropping my followers and then no matter how many notices I get that &quot;so-and-so just followed you&quot; my number of followers remains at 67. It was zooming up to 72 for awhile (chuckle) but considering I seldom tweet, why would anyone drop me? Since they won&#39;t tell me who dropped me, I never know. I wouldn&#39;t care is Russian bots followed me.

And tons of people shared and commented how bad that was and how they should be taken down a peg and shut down etc. I was about to share but then I thought and looked them up I found no videos online I also found no reviews on any site (I know they&#39;re new but if they had the monster of all worst experiences you&#39;d thing someone would have at least tweeted it.) No one other then this poster showed up in any of the searches I did and the only reviews were from a completely different location which had mostly good reviews anyway. so I commented this saying we should share until we get proof and I had nothing but people calling me stupid and an idiot for doing the research and stain there&#39;s no proof. All the responses I got were from cherry picked reviews from the wrong location and more people claiming things they couldn&#39;t prove like the company deleting negative reviews online (but if there was evidence which came first the girl claiming wrong doing or the company deleting bad reviews people could have been so pationate about the post that a few of them could have been doxing  the company with bad reviews.)

However, social media companies, including Twitter, have a fatal flaw that, until fixed, will leave many right-wingers angry at the platform. The employees there may have the best intentions, and they seem to be incredibly nice and hardworking people. But, they all hold very similar viewpoints, which lean rather farther to the left. This echo chamber is what is so concerning for us on the right. I believe that Twitter should make an effort to hire people with diversity of opinions to work on their platform. This way, work can be checked by others who hold different beliefs and hold each other accountable for mistakes they might\u2019ve missed because of their beliefs. I want left-wingers to check right-wingers, and vice versa.

What if a lack of censorship means people can be harrased into abandoning the discourse entirely? Should the government be involved in checking for company bias?

Instead they may see you as an attacker who tries to limit their freedom to communicate their political beliefs. And I purposefully use the word belief, because that is what it has currently come down to: we believe certain information, and we don&#39;t believe other. Most people don&#39;t care if it are facts, don&#39;t want to bother or spend time to check it, or don&#39;t even know the difference anymore anyway.<br>I think we should accept that there are moralities that are not compatible with ours, and I believe that there are ways to make us live among eachother without bothering eachother.

In the grand scheme of things, inhabitants of earth are a community, so in the perspective of the planet and the future, even though single actors can profit from war and conflict, the net result for the community is not benefit.<br>And for those who will dismiss my statement saying that it&#39;s just an unrealistic claim, I can say that I&#39;m working on something that is not ready for release yet, but it is based on the idea that whoever understands that people are not living alone by themselves, are able to do so without conflict given the right conditions where they don&#39;t have to compromise on their personal beliefs (and views).

That was the start of the appeal to the knee-jerk sentiment (we could not guard against) over rational argument.  <br>Rupert Murdoch weaponised these techniques in the form of Fox News and News International, but his competitors were not far behind.  CNN beat the war drum for over a year before the Iraq invasion.  A common technique is to promote a sensational story for days, (such as the discovery of WMDs in Iraq), then issue a single retraction when the report is proven false.  Even for the people who see the rectraction, the <b>emotional payload is still in play,</b> despite it no longer having a rational basis.  This is how bias is created.

Most often, Reddit gets to the bottom of things, so what happens when you can&#39;t trust Reddit?", "comment_date": "2019-04-09T21:14:52Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "qfc1313", "comment_text": "Do REDDIT PLEASE!", "comment_date": "2019-04-09T21:14:07Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "major Tom", "comment_text": "Awesome Videos!!!!!

Most of us would fall somewhere in the middle; we want to keep what we like and change what we don\u2019t like (most real politics negotiates the balance at this point), but people like to push us out of this middle area where we can find common ground and move us off to each side and then paint each extreme in the worst possible way to the opposite side.  According to those sewing division, conservatives resist change so they can keep their position of privilege so they can keep oppressing minorities and women, and liberals want to take all your money and give it to those who don\u2019t deserve it and to destroy everything that\u2019s dear.

Alan Turing is considered by many to be the father of modern computer science. He invented the stored-program computer and the &quot;universal Turing machine&quot; that is still taught in some college computer science courses.  He was also keenly interested in the human brain and how thinking occurred and whether it could be reproduced with a machine. <br><br><br>He proposed what is now called the &quot;Turing Test&quot; of artificial intelligence. In this test a human subject is placed in a room with nothing but a keyboard and monitor. Outside the room is either another keyboard and monitor manned by a real person or a computer attempting to simulate a real person. The human subject interacts with the other human or computer in any way desired. They can ask questions, make jokes, etc. After an hour or so the human subject is asked if they were talking to a real human or a computer or if they were unable to decide. The objective of the AI program in the computer is to fool the human subject into thinking they are dealing with a  real human and not a machine. The success of the AI program can be quantified by the number of human subjects it was able to fool.<br><br>The bots attacking Twitter and Youtube are attempting to mimic real humans in order to get past Twitter&#39;s filters. Twitter&#39;s countermeasures are attempting to decide if the person creating an account is a real person or a bot. Basically, they are engaging in an ongoing Turing Test on a grand scale. It&#39;s millions of Turing Tests per day. It&#39;s a Turing Test between commercial enterprises, not academic researchers. It&#39;s a Turing Test with real money at stake and real social consequences.  <br><br><br>I appreciate that your videos focus on the human aspect of this and the tribalism it fosters but the from the pure 100% geek standpoint the Turing Test angle is fascinating.

How often do you check your history? have you ever notice a post you did not make?<br>I know this, because I have been on both sides, I have hacked into things and I&#39;m also admin on many websites and systems where I have to counter such hacks.<br><br>For example most effective way of sending anonymous email, is to &quot;steal&quot; someone&#39;s account and use that account to send the email, then delete this email from victim&#39;s sent mails and block the email (where you sent the anonymous email to) so that the person can&#39;t reply back. This way email is authentic, yet it cannot be traced back to the original source and owner of the stolen account (victim) would not even be aware of it, he/she can still use the account and doesn&#39;t realize that his/her account was (or still is) being used for sending out anonymous emails.<br><br>This &quot;trick&quot; works on all platforms really. On PC it gets bit harder if you know what you&#39;re doing, but on phone it&#39;s quite easy to make someone fall for something that takes control of your phone and uses it as a bot to send out those manipulative posts / emails ..etc.<br><br>BOTTOM LINE - those things exists, because of people&#39;s stupidity and desire to use scam to get ahead of others! If there would be nobody out there who&#39;s willing to buy those services to boost their accounts, then there would really be no need for that and if people would not be stupid enough to fall for those things (not clicking on random links on emails, not downloading random garbage..etc), then those attackers couldn&#39;t really use those methods.", "comment_date": "2019-04-09T13:06:37Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "wightwulf1944", "comment_text": "Thanks for helping us understand how twitter engineers try to protect us from social engineering.

Main reason this concerns me is because the vast majority of these large social media outlets are based in silicon valley, so naturally they will tend to be politically biased in one direction letting more of there supported view points slip past the algorithm.

Don&#39;t you think these are legit contents if you disregard who tweeted them? We are coming into an era that people are being judge by their intention. This, I think, is thought crime. We can be attracted to these tweets because we are already divided, not because they are engineered contents posted by bot accounts. At this age of time, main stream media is not any better than the bot-controlled accounts. Main stream media lie to a greater amount of audience on a greater scale. We are not under attack. It is simply that other organizations are challenging the status quo of main stream media. When your senator stops speaking for you, you vote for another one. When main stream media start to lie to you, you turn around and look for other sources.<br><br>I do not care whether the accounts were controlled by russian bots. If it tweets something that media tries to cover up, I&#39;ll retweet it. The enemy of my enemy, can be my friend temporarily.<br><br>Also, you keep saying that &quot;they&quot; try to divide us.

Firstly, I found that most of these &quot;hate&quot; messages from fake accounts are actually true things, that a regular person won&#39;t say because of l!btards and their censorship(we all know how silicon valley companies are with this stuff...). These methods of manipulation are getting harder and harder to use, and become more and more exclusive to, well to say it simply, smart people. Therefore I&#39;m not really that concern about for the messages propagated by them. And that graph at <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V-1RhQ1uuQ4&amp;t=3m10s\">3:10</a>, is actually complete and utter bullsh!t, look at platforms like 4chan, 0 censorship, 0 PC, 0 Idiot proofing. And yet, somehow, I (and all of my friends that use it) find it incredibly useful, far more than Twitter. And if you think about it, the more some platform uses different types of censorship, usually under the buzzwords &quot;it&#39;s hate speech!!!&quot;, the more that platform starts to degrade, firstly, of course, for the creators, and for consumers shortly after, think Twitch, think YouTube. The real truth beneath all of this mess is that public companies like Twitter find it useful to run their platforms in a Communism-like regime, free-thinking people and uncensored people are very hard to manipulate. And platforms that are hard to manipulate are hard to invest in, unpredictable! So again, treating the consequence rather than the cause, and as you can see, not only that they&#39;re not succeeding, they are failing so bad it&#39;s laughable.

I trust my father, but I&#39;ve caught him being wrong, so I double check what he says IF it happens to matter. I trust my peers, but I verify what they say IF it happens to matter. By the same token, I trust your videos, but I verify IF it happens to matter.<br><br><br>That said, there is reason not to trust too, though. The people I have the option to vote for, I do NOT trust because I have reason to believe they are all malicious actors, though sadly not foreign. In 2012, for example, we had the infamous Todd Akin running against Claire McCaskill, which went from a certain Republican win after her callous treatment of voters to her victory after he said something insane. It was revealed at the time that she had donated to his primary campaign, but she has since bragged about her pied-piper strategy that got him through the primary. This was remarkable in that it was so out in the open and blatant, but this is politics as usual. And there is no &quot;local&quot; exemption to this - we&#39;ve had governors, mayors, sheriffs, and county clerks do very illegal things because they thought they could get away with it, use intentionally divisive language to prey on people&#39;s fears, and openly act to harm the people who elected them in blatant disregard for their campaign promises. <br><br><br>I used to trust media. That&#39;s a trust, though, that was legitimately lost outside of Twitter&#39;s sphere of influence. The unverified story to news pipeline has been increasingly harmful, as has been the clear but unstated agendas of the various networks. But the real loss of trust has been with the clear psychological manipulation through hate and anger. This started becoming a problem in the 90&#39;s with political &quot;shock jocks&quot; who intentionally went beyond the pale to get people to listen in so that they could know what they were supposed to be upset about. It expanded into television &quot;news&quot; where news networks would set aside ever-growing blocks of time where news-like presentations were given by intentionally offensive personalities. Online, it has manifested in the form of &quot;bad takes&quot; that have people clicking the article more to find out who the author is and if there&#39;s a comments section than to actually read the article. And, sadly, local news is not exempt from bad practices. The &quot;retraction on page 10&quot; yellow journalism strategy never truly went away, but it gains new life in agenda-driven journalism that runs hit pieces on people associated with the politician it wants to hurt...then buries the retraction.<br><br><br>I know it&#39;s controversial, but this also extends to local businesses whose marketing campaigns rely on copyright infringement, misleading phrasing, abuse of audio compression, and then an appeal to their alleged impact on the local community (which, at least here, is worse than Walmart&#39;s).<br><br><br>Even if foreign actors are preying on it, the distrust was locally grown. While my examples only span my lifetime, people have held distrust of these things for centuries, and never without reason. You&#39;ll probably recognize some of the terms I used are so old they squeezed fresh dinosaur for their gas back when the terms were coined. Social media explodes the scale and impact of these problems, but the problems won&#39;t go away just by tweaking algorithms. A sea change is needed before we can insist on the value of trust.", "comment_date": "2019-04-08T23:16:50Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Nikita K", "comment_text": "Why can&#39;t they just not censor anything.", "comment_date": "2019-04-08T23:16:37Z", "likes_count": 3}, {"comment_by": "Harold H", "comment_text": "The sad part of the whole issue is that 99% of all people online do NOT truly understand this technology.<br>And I would guesstimate that around 85 - 90 % of us do not understand it as well as we should.<br>The ExpressVPN tech MAY be one of the best things I have heard of in a long time in keeping data safe.<br>What I do NOT understand is how we are all in such a rush to actually give away our data online.<br>EVERYONE that runs a business now tries to collect as much data about YOU as possible.

More importantly, it&#39;s that most of the time this doesn&#39;t mean the sites themselves but rather the many affiliated services /they/ use (like ad networks, social networks, analytics platforms, etcetera) and even malicious code that manages to compromise any of these non-security-focused platforms.  Most of the information they can and do collect was never vulnerable to disclosure in transit to begin with because it was already encrypted (assuming it mattered and no one was making the kind of obvious mistakes that get professionals fired).  VPNs aren&#39;t useless, but their use-cases mostly revolve around avoiding being physically tracked down by actors with some but not all of the resources to do so.  Remaining truly anonymous (if that&#39;s your aim) requires more care, paranoia, and resources than most people can reasonably hope to accomplish, and a VPN offers one tiny fragment of that recipe that&#39;s little use on its own.<br><br>In short, stop worrying about who&#39;s listening into the conversation when it&#39;s the /intended audience/ that&#39;s compromising your privacy.  Privacy experts weren&#39;t really able to predict how innocuous metadata about your activity could prove distinct enough to uniquely profile you in such a distributed manner, nor that any actors would be able to gather enough of it to compile such profiles.  This is why they focused on educating us about transport layer security despite that only being an issue when obvious mistakes are being made.  Worrying about whether someone can get access to your bank account or credit card as you bank or shop online is fighting yesterday&#39;s battles.  (The short answer is they can&#39;t, the medium answer is that your biggest threat is still shoulder surfers followed by entering such data on malware-infected computers, and the long answer is too long for this medium).  Even worrying about actors with direct trunk-line access that are bad or vulnerable to abuse (like the NSA) is a bit like trying to protect yourself from Russian nukes.

My issue and maybe not entirely on topic because it goes beyond bots. My question is, who watches the watchmen? Manipulation by rogue watchers especially but exclusively where human interaction is necessary does unfortunately happen.  Bias mixed with the bubble effect has larger influence just by the nature of bias. So many of these social media companies are nearly monolithic when it comes to employees and some of their political views. I dont think it is entirely possible to not have that influence these companies both in unintentional and sadly sometimes intentional ways, not maliciously but out of a sense of doing what they may see as the right thing to do but it still takes away from individuals freedoms. I think it is difficult in today&#39;s political climate to find equal treatment across the board on social media by these companies especially in areas of political bias. Political activism is pushed as heroic but can have a much darker side when applied in these great big corporations. Not hating on them at all here, it is almost unavoidable under the circumstances. I know this isn&#39;t entirely on subject or rather is only partly on subject but this subject bleeds over and combines in  many ways. Like the nice lady said. An attack uses much the same methods as legitimate methods of influence. It must be maddening because not only do these people have to deal with fighting these external influences as illustrated in the video they also have to deal with policing themselves and then the craziness from users as well.

This type of &quot;choice&quot; makes it seem as though I have a choice in what my news is being customized to, but the &quot;choices&quot; I&#39;m presented with would either leave me in the dark completely, or continuing to get the news I don&#39;t want. This is an obvious political bias to me from a big name company (Google news feed, in this case).

There is no light in the space between hot plasma on the Sun and atmosphere on Earth.\r<br>\r<br>All scientists thought light is EM wave or photon particle or both traveling in space at light speed. They are all wrong. There is no wave, no photon, nothing traveling in space at light speed. Energy teleport from matter to matter instantly, becomes light wave traveling in medium at light speed. Light speed in vacuum space is infinite. Therefore, cosmology, relativity, QM and electromagnetism are all wrong.\r<br>\r<br>By using MIT 10 trillion frame per second high speed camera, scientists can measure light speed in a vacuum glass bottle to prove light speed in vacuum is infinite. But they won&#39;t do it, because if the truth is out, they will be in big trouble.\r<br>\r<br>Electromagnetic Radiation\r<br>\r<br>Electrons are on the surface of all matters. Electrons are constantly vibrating due to the thermal energy atoms carried. The higher temperature the higher vibration frequency.\r<br>\r<br>Vibrating electrons carry kinetic energy, that energy can transfer to distant electrons through the repulsion force between line of sight electrons F=Ke x ee/R^2, science call it electromagnetic radiation. In Fact, there is only electrostatic radiation, there is no electromagnetic radiation.\r<br>\r<br>How to prove it?\r<br>\r<br>Electrostatic force decays at 1/R^2, light wave strength decays at 1/R^2, Magnetic force decays at 1/R^3.\r<br>\r<br>Photoelectric effect is misinterpretation. Light wave energy density is proportional to frequency. When light wave frequency is high enough, electrons will be vibrating out from solar cell.\r<br>\r<br>There is no photon particle impact electron and knock it out from atoms.\r<br>\r<br>That&#39;s why Einstein said he knows NOT what are light quanta. Everyone thinks he knows it is mistaken.\r<br>\r<br>The first person to do a double slit experiment in vacuum, prove there is no light wave in vacuum space, can win a Nobel and change the history.\r<br>\r<br>If you have the access, you should take this unique opportunity.\r<br>\r<br>Put the slits and screen on the walls of a square glass container. Point a laser beam on the slits, video the light wave interference on the screen. Then vacuum the container, video the interference disappear and left two bright lines on the screen as if light act as particle.\r<br>\r<br>In fact, light is not wave nor particle, light is vibrating electrostatic force carry by vibrating electrons/atoms.\r<br>\r<br>Please make sure the slits and the screen are on the inside of the container walls.

Literally, on my bed right now I have a book titled Hooked: how to build habit forming products. I&#39;ve got more into network analysis recently: target the influencers.

My personal view is to consider if I&#39;m ok with the ends: the end behaviour. The means are less important. For example, I don&#39;t feel bad about designing interventions to make carrying a condom or using a fitness app a more habitual behaviour. Whether I achieved that through fancy psychology or a simple poster campaign is kinda irrelevant.

Come to find out they where committing copyright infringement against apple, Hasbro and Disney and they offered me partial ownership of the co. Buttttttt I knew that could lead to prison so I bailed. Ever since that happened I backed off using these methods of manipulation. Them committing infringements and cloning items to sell damaged my view and respect for these rich guys I looked up to.

An algorithm isn&#39;t going to be able to adapt fast enough to prevent being manipulated. However, a human can. So, what if we could subscribe to social media curators. For example, I know John Doe is trust worthy and does his research. If I trust John Doe then I can subscribe and only content John Doe has curated will appear in my news feed and recommendations. I&#39;m still seeing the original creators work and the original creator still gets paid his ad revenue, but the curator is also paid a small contribution. This way we can build trust with a small number of curators and not have to research ever single content creator which is just unrealistic.\r<br>\r<br>How this would work - create a new role in youtube called a Curator who you can subscribe to. Then the only the curator&#39;s recommendations would appear in your news feed. Obviously, if you are subscribed to more then one curator then your news feed would be a mix of the two or more.\r<br>\r<br>Benefit - Curators have incentive to approve advertiser friendly content and advertisers can build relationships with curators. \r<br>\r<br>Known issue - This could create echo chambers, but I think their may be ways to create incentives to prevent this.", "comment_date": "2019-04-08T16:48:28Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "CINTRON", "comment_text": "These are excellent and should probably be mandatory for kids to see before getting their first social media account.", "comment_date": "2019-04-08T16:47:32Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Misac Tiba", "comment_text": "Reddit really needs some attention on these topics as well.", "comment_date": "2019-04-08T16:47:07Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Marvin Bowen", "comment_text": "On a personal level, I truly appreciate you.

Teach people to be critical thinkers and the problem goes away.<br><br>While concerns about people believing in false narratives in mass are a ligitiment concern the way you assign fault and responsibility are not justly placed.  It is this phenomena among other things as to why morals is so important to society.<br><br>Dumbing the population down and dismissing morality as old-hat or superstition breaks down unity.<br><br>The primary reason being that once you establish a precedent of the nessisity for people to act as controllers or regulators in society the logical conclusion will always be that for any individual to get what they want they must achieve control over others.<br><br>In this environment people people will look to any source of information that can conceivably be used to legitimize their control over others.  The truth is not actually important to achieve that control.

Moral principle requires justification to take control over other people through the other&#39;s misdeeds.<br><br>Your insistence that otherizing people is where the problem starts to show is about the dumbest idea ever presented.  Such an idea though intended to compel people to qualify the information they receive by considering the qualifications of the source will instead only serve as a blocker to people achieving a better understanding  of moral principle.  This is because trust is not an issue of expertise.  That is to say that you do not achieve trust by being an expert.  Being an expert only makes a person with nafarious intent a more potent  adversary.  Being an expert does not negate the potential of a person to have nafarious intent.<br><br>Without a moral foundation people will be unable to discern truth from deception.

At least from my perspective a gaming company that i poured lots of money into banned me out of nowhere with no explanation given. When i dug deeper i realized it was an automated ban because the algorithm thought i had a shady internet connection. When i tried to talk to the support staff about it all they could say was &quot;No you were in the wrong, we can&#39;t provide proof for it though.&quot; But when i talked to an engineer from that same company they told me it was a mistake on their part. Even though it was a well known flaw in the algorithm the company did nothing to help me out and i lost all my money.<br> At least in the social media side of things you can&#39;t really get robbed off your money, but a lot of time and effort goes into an account. I wish they cared more about the real people using the platform rather than trying to go hardcore on banning bots.

It&#39;s challenging enough trying to balance the real needs of human beings whose lives are impacted by the software you develop \u2014 but then trying to anticipate what impact the features you build out or the design choices you make might have on, say, the democratic uprising Arab Spring or the Kremlin&#39;s propaganda campaign during annexation of the Ukraine. The deeper your understanding of the technology, the clearer your understanding of what&#39;s ethical and what&#39;s not, for that technology \u2014 but there&#39;s also the harsh political reality that if you discover or call attention to these problems, you&#39;re likely to become the scapegoat for a negligent organization. <br><br>I know how difficult it is to act with integrity in those moments, so I appreciate you shining light into this part of the web. The only hesitation I have with a &quot;we should all be unified&quot; message is that it puts the onus on people who largely don&#39;t even realize how or the degree to which they&#39;re being manipulated.  I\u2019m a huge proponent of forgiveness and grace. I&#39;m a Christ-follower and care a great deal about those things! But what I&#39;m seeing among many of my friends (on the left and on the right) is cynicism and apathy masquerading as unity. (e.g. \u201cI&#39;ll just stay off Facebook because I can\u2019t trust anyone\u201d or \u201canyone who disagrees with me must be a bot and not worth my time engaging\u201d.) Almost like a DDOS attack for human minds\u2014and that&#39;s something that unity won&#39;t necessarily fix (though it will certainly lessen/slow the damage) and will continue to be a problem until we can figure out a way to address the underlying flaws and unhealthy incentives in our platforms.<br><br>Anyhow, thank you so much for tackling this important topic, Destin.  I appreciate your time, your video, and your service to our country. I&#39;ve been a fan of your videos since you shot rockets at a brush pile. My family watches them regularly.
