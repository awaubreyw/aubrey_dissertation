This means that it is emphatically NOT a grass (family Poaceae), despite the fact that it is referred to as such numerous times in the video.  The shape and the arrangement of seeds in the fruits (capsules/pods) is highly suggestive of the pea/bean (Fabaceae) family.  Its explosive seed dispersal is neither rare nor limited to its genus or even family. I have, in my garden, two sister species (in the genus Impatiens (family Balsaminaceae)  that disperse their seeds in the same way.  They are both known by their common name; Touch Me Not.

I learned the process last year, and I noted how quick it was from holding my fingers to both sides of the seed pod. By sliding them up or down, I could tell where it would begin curling from, and since there was no delay from sliding my fingers up to that released portion of the seed pod curling up, I could understand it was an incredibly fast process.

The plant you mention, Arabidopsis Thaliana (thale cress), is part of the research you show in your video that&#39;s called Morphomechanical Innovation Drives Explosive Seed Dispersal. Arabidopsis is a plant relative of cardamine which does not have exploding seeds and which they used as a reference in the research. Arabidopsis thaliana was the first plant ever to have its genome fully sequenced (I understand from wikipedia) and is therefore very well understood on a genetical and molecular level.

I&#39;ve seen it in a river and the line goes to a convert, I&#39;ve seen it go to a random point on the shore, I&#39;ve seen it in a still lake just randomly going from shore to shore. And I do not know hat causes it. My first theory was that it was to different flows of water meeting, but that wouldn&#39;t happen in the middle of a river or in a still lake.

Or at least, not fling them out as far?  If so, could this suggest the plant as evolved so it releases seeds when conditions are right for seed growth i.e. after it rains or other environmental conditions are better (humidity, the season, etc) but then actively not release when conditions are not good for the seeds, like say if it&#39;s too dry out, or the plant has died (or is in hibernation due to heat, the season, etc).

I always tried to include my children in outdoor activities and point out things like that to them and then ask them how THEY thought it happened. Oh one thing about the Acacias though is that it&#39;s not a Strap bracelet kid of thing by itself, but they spiral away from the other side of the pod is a corkscrew fashion with the seeds more or less unattached from the pod halves, not entirely unattached in many cases but hey, not everything goes according to plan, even in nature. But in the mid to late fall go out walking around acacias and you&#39;ll hear them popping by themselves or when they get touched and you&#39;ll see them doing it and because the pods are much larger than grass seed pods so you&#39;ll have a better time filming them, if you choose to do so. I wager that this is how MANY plants cause their seeds to be dispersed, how about Pine trees? they only fire off their seeds when exposed to fire, well, some trees do that, not sure if it&#39;s pine, it might be spruce or some other conifer that does it, but you can see the great Variety that Our Father in Heaven has created  for plants, that are stationary entities spread their seeds far enough away from the parent plant as to not cause the death of all their offspring.

It&#39;s possible for a living thing to do something like this, but I&#39;ve never heard of a plant that can do it, so I think it&#39;s unlikely. <br>B: Water pressure.  A plant&#39;s cell walls allow it to build up significant internal pressures. If I&#39;m not mistaken, this is how a venus fly-trap works.  This is the closest thing I know other plants can do, so of my wild guesses, this is the one I&#39;d consider most likely. <br>C: Spring action. One of my house plants, when it grows a new flower, the flower starts curled up on itself.  The bud holds the single petaled flower back until it&#39;s stem grows long enough for the tip of the petal to fully exit the bud.  I can imagine with a stiffer bud/stem you could build up spring force.

Generally what you say in the advertisement is true but Google has been proven to be an unreliable tool for a lot of information. Rather than just aggregating results based on search terms, Google analyzes the results and applies a bias filter to give you only the results it wants you to see. This creates significant consequences because that filter is purely political. This causes obvious problems when researching political candidates but other side effects also show up as a result. Science is often hardest hit from this as the politics of science typically end up more important to Google than the actual science. This prevents competing ideas and discussion from taking place limiting dialogue that would normally propel science forward.

Finally, a topic I have some first-hand background experience with! I\u2019ve worked for four years in a lab that works with Arabidopsis.

One thing I noticed in your video is that you were interacting with mostly green looking siliques. I\u2019m not sure if you observed this at all in your trials with the camera, but in our lab it\u2019s typically easier to physically disturb than the yellow/brown looking siliques to \u201cexplode\u201d than the green ones. This is because as the seeds mature inside the seed pod, the whole seed pod is programmed to dry out, as this makes the carpels fly off more easily and spreads the seeds better.

We used to put them in a puddle or we would pour a couple of drops of water on them and they would pop open after maybe 10-20 seconds and blast the seeds away. The pods were some 2 cm long and they were made of a semi-woody material. They would even pop in our hands when we held them for a short period of time, maybe some 3-5 minutes, I guess because of the moisture (sweat) that appeared in our hands as we held them, because all this we did on summertime. The blast would even hurt a little when it happened on our hands haha.

Let&#39;s leave these things of this world behind for in scripture it says in Matthew 24:35 that heaven and earth will disappear, but my words will never disappear. &quot; Also in 2 corinthians 4:18&quot; So we fix our eyes not on what is seen, but on what is unseen, since what is seen is temporary, but what is unseen is eternal.&quot; Time is so short. And I always say this&quot; I want all of us to be saved. &quot; Jesus is coming back soon.&quot; with tears in my eyes I love you guys. Let&#39;s take Jesus and His words seriously in these time were in. I know the road isn&#39;t easy because there are so much distractions and temptations in this life. But through prayer and fasting we can overcome them. I don&#39;t want to force anything on anybody or even force them to do something they don&#39;t. But if you were to see your mother about to get hit by a big truck, you would do everything to try and save her. So I do the same thing for us about the wrath of God that is to come. I don&#39;t want anyone I love, know/don&#39;t know or even those who hate or dislike me to face such things. Because I know every soul is precious to God and are valuable to Him. Because before we were born He know us, He knitted us in our mother&#39;s womb, He called us to be His children . His love for us is so great and so strong, it&#39;s beyond human comprehension, that even the angels in heaven don&#39;t understand it. So I want to tell you it&#39;s time to get ready, time to prepare ourselves for the Second Coming of Christ, for the trails and tribulations and for the rapture. As you can see, so many people have turned away from God. The world has become so immoral, wicked, disgusting and violent. Killing people without any care or heart. And that shows that the love of God is growing cold in the hearts of people. Please be ready for when the Son of Man comes. Time is running out. Let&#39;s not leave this world with regrets. Because I tell you this, my biggest regret is not knowing Jesus Christ earlier. I love you Guys and Jesus loves you too, that&#39;s why He didn&#39;t think twice about dying on the Cross for us, knowing that we may not even love Him back. Please take what was said today in consideration because ready or not Jesus Christ is coming back believe it or not Jesus is coming back. <br><br>How to be saved? To be saved, a man must confess that Jesus is Lord while acknowledging in his heart that Christ must have full rule over his life and that he died on the cross for our sins and was resurrected on the third day\ud83d\ude4f\ud83c\udffe. Also one must repent and turn away from thier sin. NOW, is the time to turn to JESUS, do it before its too LATE and the DOOR of Grace is Shut.<br><br>Prayer of Salvation in Jesus Christ\ud83d\ude4f<br><br>Dear Lord Jesus, I know that I am a sinner, and I ask for Your forgiveness. I believe You died for my sins and rose from the dead. I turn from my sins and invite You to come into my heart and life. I want to trust and follow You as my Lord and Savior.<br><br>Spreading the Gospel on every content\ud83d\ude4f\u2764\ufe0f,", "comment_date": "2021-05-31T21:36:07Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Abe The Rock", "comment_text": "Sorry i skipped to the slowmo", "comment_date": "2021-05-31T21:33:45Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Preston Ayer", "comment_text": "Another example of God\u2019s beautiful design.", "comment_date": "2021-05-31T21:32:23Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Louis Nicholls", "comment_text": "That \u2018redbug\u2019 that went flying was actually an exuvia (or shed skin)", "comment_date": "2021-05-31T21:30:43Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Super solid snake", "comment_text": "Never smoke the seeds", "comment_date": "2021-05-31T21:30:42Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Big Boss", "comment_text": "Do the seeds actually make a sound when exloding?", "comment_date": "2021-05-31T21:29:37Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "MoonFlux", "comment_text": "Huh... it is almost like the plant was designed to do that.", "comment_date": "2021-05-31T21:29:03Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "myyoutubeusername", "comment_text": "yeah, google has a team of people who manually adjusts search results on almost all important topics, this kinda makes their search more of an advice, I suggest going with duckduckgo .", "comment_date": "2021-05-31T21:28:51Z", "likes_count": 79}, {"comment_by": "James Dean", "comment_text": "You say you&#39;re fighting misinformation, then promoting google.", "comment_date": "2021-05-31T21:28:03Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Person Tran", "comment_text": "Get high by exploding", "comment_date": "2021-05-31T21:27:33Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "bigredinfinity", "comment_text": "Evolution is awesome", "comment_date": "2021-05-31T21:27:26Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Kerri C", "comment_text": "&quot;So, obviously I don&#39;t know what I&#39;m doing&quot; hahaha I love this so much.

This is cool! Thanks!!! I know a poor lady who had Alzheimer&#39;s and as she was getting older, the darn police thought she was just nuts cuz ..( she&#39;s with God, now) she had a giant Wisteria around her Inn in Maine and she was calling cops saying someone was shooting outside her house!!! When her daughter told me about this, at the time, I called her back and reported her Mom wasn&#39;t nuts. As I pulled up to my own home that day, which I git basically run out of by mean neighbors not wanting me there after 23 years who I was trying to help them and their family with stopping drugs and alcohol, and silly lazy ( some police) and town officials who listened to their lies about me, claiming my Love and Reliance for and on God, Jesus and Holy Spirit was crazy, and in 2016  I was foreclosed. The town of Derry NH offered little resources when a person hits hard times and I just pray that God Lifts that town, bringing them tighter and closer together instead of trying to run people who love animals out. I wasn&#39;t the only one. The town had become less agricultural over the 23 years I lived there and others in the media and paper who had chickens and horses ( I had been to their aggravation able to evade the new ritzy ordinance laws through the Grandfather clause cuz I lived there so long, so they sought other means)...anyway....getting back to the Wysteria study...God Showed me to tell my friend that her Mom wasn&#39;t senility delusional . I heard loud pops like I gun, too, and upon further inspection, cuz that&#39;s what I do....I found my Sweet Wistetria merrily sowing her seeds!!! Popping away...LOUDLY!!!! Lol!!! I like your video!!! God bless you, on Jesus&#39; Name, and All of us!!! PS: I am in Nashua NH now, after being homeless for.a year and at 5O sleeping outside then in a tent and under the town library and parking garages, and have had the help of lots of great resource directors who care here, and have an apartment, with with animals rescue and rehab again, and have animals again ( mine had been so horribly taken away and I cry and pray to Trust God to Care for them And Reunite us again everyday...worst thing that happened to me in my Life, but God, Jesus and Holy Spirit  Comes Through!!! I Love AND Trust Him....Always!!!) , So if you&#39;re down , Pray to God to Lift you UP and He WILL, and always, like this Awesome Brother in Christ,  who made this video, be Willing to do the work!!!! If you question something and His Plan Leads you to explore, then DO So, in Jesus&#39; Name!!! It very well may vindicate someone!!! Remember the Salem, MA witch trials where so many good people suffered!!! I admire poor Giles Corey who was weighted to death but went down bravely saying, &quot; more weight!&quot;. In Jesus&#39; Holy Name, Dear Father, please bless and watch over Giles and forgive us All With Your Divine Mercy and take us All, Hand in Hand, Into Your Awesome Kingdom Coming, in Jesus&#39; Holy Name!!!

I thought you might like to know a little more about this plant.  As you noted, the common name is &quot;Hairy Bittercress,&quot; and the Latin/scientific name is Cardamime hirsuta.  It was named by Linnaeus, the 18th C. Swedish botanist and taxonomist.  Hairy Bittercress is not native to the USA, but came from Europe--maybe brought on purpose, because it is possibly edible, like watercress.  (But please don&#39;t eat it until you check with someone who&#39;s more learned about it than I am!!!)  We call it a weed because it grows where we don&#39;t want it--like in lawns and gardens.  But, &quot;weed&quot; is a value judgment, not a technical term.  Hey, some people grow dandelions in their gardens on purpose for food and medicine!!!    <br><br>Hairy Bittercress is not a grass, but a member of the the mustard family, to which (among lots of other plants) broccoli belongs!  I like Hairy Bittercress, because it is usually the first plant I see growing and then blooming in the spring--it has four tiny white petals.  Eventually, each flower makes one of those pods--the pod starts growing up from the middle of the petals, and the petals fall off.   By the way, you can see one of its &quot;divided&quot; leaves at <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUaTOoVmg1Q&amp;t=1m58s\">1:58</a>, just below a little purple flower.<br><br>Hairy Bittercress is an annual plant--it lasts only one year.  That&#39;s why it has to send out as many seeds as it can.  I knew it shot out its seeds, but now I know how!

I believe it pops open to fling the seeds around to help them be able to grow away from the shadow of the original plant, and so they can spread more quickly. I think the black pods get hot in the sunshine and pop open. I looked at the pods and they pop open because the fiber material of the pods grows in a curve that puts it in tension, and the pods release tension by splitting open.

As I only work with a specific species (complex, <i>R. nudiflora</i> ), that has a distribution from the southern US to southern Mexico (from Texas to the Yucatan peninsula), commonly known as Petunias. But the way the genus disperses its seeds seems to be similar to this <i>Arabidopsis thanliana</i> (which by the way, it&#39;s a model species and it is also non-mycorrhizal... which is an interesting trait since most plants form mycorrhiza). <i>Ruellia</i> has a fruit that, as it dries, tries to open up, but the top part of the fruit stops it from opening. The more it dries the more the stronger the force as it tries to pull itself apart. Time or a bit of water on the top seems to trigger the fruit open. The top of the fruit loses strength and the fruit simply explodes, with a snapping sound, sending seeds very far away. The system doesn&#39;t seem to be as intricate as <i>A. thaliana,</i> but I would personally love to see it happening in slow-mo since I work with that plant. I may try to sending you a video of it if I can, but I&#39;m not sure where to share it.<br>Edit: the species in the video is actually <i>Cardamine hirsuta</i>", "comment_date": "2021-05-30T20:47:38Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Edward Pasternak", "comment_text": "Please more videos like this!

You describe it as a \u201creverse banana slap bracelet\u201d, but I think what happens isa bit different. After the plant covers the seed with the outer layer of the seed pod, it dries it out. When this happens the outer layer contracts, and when the plant is disturbed it breaks at the bottom of the pod. I have multiple reasons for this assumption too, one is that it requires a rather strong material to make a slap bracelet like mechanism, and another is from my own observations of a plant we have in Idaho. It is a large bush full of peas, and late in the season it dries out the peas and they explode, because they have very small fibers connected the shell together. However, I have looked at no research papers, I have only reverse engineered it in my own head and talked to my mom, (who is a botanist).
