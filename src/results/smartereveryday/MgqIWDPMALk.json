His fame spread far and wide, for he was greatly helped until he became powerful.\r<br>\r<br>16 But after Uzziah became powerful, his pride led to his downfall. He was unfaithful to the Lord his God, and entered the temple of the Lord to burn incense on the altar of incense. <br><br>17 Azariah the priest with eighty other courageous priests of the Lord followed him in. <br><br>18 They confronted King Uzziah and said, \u201cIt is not right for you, Uzziah, to burn incense to the Lord. That is for the priests, the descendants of Aaron, who have been consecrated to burn incense. Leave the sanctuary, for you have been unfaithful; and you will not be honored by the Lord God.\u201d\r<br>\r<br>19 Uzziah, who had a censer in his hand ready to burn incense, became angry. While he was raging at the priests in their presence before the incense altar in the Lord\u2019s temple, leprosy[c] broke out on his forehead. <br><br>20 When Azariah the chief priest and all the other priests looked at him, they saw that he had leprosy on his forehead, so they hurried him out. Indeed, he himself was eager to leave, because the Lord had afflicted him.\r<br>\r<br>21 King Uzziah had leprosy until the day he died. He lived in a separate house[d]\u2014leprous, and banned from the temple of the Lord.

Without the cardboard plug, the powder lays down in the cartridge and fire goes faster over the top of the powder pile and then ignites the unburnt powder causing a backwards explosion and possibly injury to the shooter.

All because when they roll it back to the firing line they are accelerating it very slowly while when the cannonball fires it is causing very rapid acceleration backwards.  Way more energy involved.

I&#39;ve been in a trench in front of cannons, with them firing overhead, about 10 feet above us. There&#39;s no way of explaining how hard that shockwave is. Every few cannon shots, we&#39;d have to shuffle our feet to keep from being buried in the dirt falling to the bottom of the trench. But then I decided to join a cannon crew. I got trained for all the positions and spent a reenacting season as a cannoneer. At a firing range, we tried out a canister round against a bunch of plywood human cutout targets. Match sticks. That&#39;s all that remained. It&#39;s horrifying. It&#39;s quite literally a giant shotgun shell. There are reports from the Civil War of soldiers literally disintegrating, leaving the soldier next to them untouched. All that remained of the other soldier were smoking shoes. Imagine that. No way of identifying the body. No way of keeping record of which soldier died where. Nothing to send the family. Nothing left to remember them by. No way to lay them to rest. Cannoneers would know they had a direct hit with a canister round, by the red mist hanging in the air after their shot. The devastation caused by these cannons are the reason why when the attacking forces overtook a cannon&#39;s position, the cannoneers would flee, leaving the cannons behind. Infantry would be treated respectfully. Cannoneers would be killed, because of the amount of casualties and devastation they caused. <br><br>I would highly recommend everyone to go to a Civil War reenactment, and talk to the reenactors. All of us have lots of information, and we love sharing it. We also love recruiting people into reenacting. I learned more about the Civil War and WWII (I switched to WWII) in two days, than I did in 4 years of history class. Being there and experiencing the lifestyle first hand is a much better teacher than reading out of any book. Talk to any reenactor and ask them how to get involved, and they&#39;ll happily help you get started. Reenacting is great for men and women, and children as well.

Man those things raise your pulse! They were very professional, they made us stay back I think 55 feet, because if the cannon ruptured (it was a larger Napoleon) it wouldn&#39;t throw anything past that (probably).
