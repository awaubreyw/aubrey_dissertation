We had one customer who came in from time to time for routine maintenance that had the hand controls installed.  A person with all four limbs functional could still drive the car but the extra lever, like this gentleman had, was still there only it was configured to be operated by the right hand.  At one point, I had to park the car and tried to do that with the hand controls out of curiosity.  I was extremely cautious which was a good thing because I don&#39;t think I moved the car more than maybe 10 feet before figuring out that this wasn&#39;t going to work out well if I pushed it.  I have the utmost respect for anyone that can operate a motor vehicle this way.
