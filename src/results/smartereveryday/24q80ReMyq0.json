I Recognize and respect.      I have over two hundred  original songs That I recorded in which I play all the instruments and do the production/ engineering on.     One song  , heck , even  one single  track on occasion  can take untold hours to get right.  Then there is the whole engineer pallete you bring to hosting/narration facet of your wide range of subject matter.  Thank you for all of your time , insights and talents. In closing I am also compelled to make you aware that your work in His vinyard is not in vane.  I have reached for and opened my bible AND read the verses that you gently  guild your videos endings with.  I had not picked it up ,  much less opened it to read , in more than a year.      I say all of this not to gain favor with you , I say it because the whole of the law and the prophets is expressed when I do for others what I would have done for me.

I have a question you may be interested in about the backwards brain bicycle. Me personally am a pretty big bike rider so the backwards brain bike really stood out to me. I was thinking about the video a lot and then i realised something, if a professional bike rider wear to try it some one who has a profession in trials bike riding or BMX often ride fakie other wise known as riding backwards. While riding backwards the stearing becomes inverted just like the backwards brain bike, the school of riding fackie on top of lots of experience in trying new things with bikes would really make a professional quick to learn how to ride it. However there is also the possibility of it taken longer but i personally think a professional would pick it up very quickly. so i ask that maybe in a future video you could find a professional BMX or trials bike rider to test this theory. I personally think a trials rider would be better but also harder to find. someone that&#39;s not professional but has a lot of experience in all different category of bike riding is someone called Seth a big bike you tuber who is know for trying new things with bikes his you tube channel is Seths bike hacks. I think he would make an excellent test subject if he was willing to help out.

This would probably mean that along the density fluctuations there is a continuously changing optical index function, the gradient of which could probably be represented by a 3D vector field function, bounded by the Prince Rupert&#39;s Drop geometry.

My feeling is that, I watch your stuff, I&#39;m subscribed, I don&#39;t need notifications to see your work (always use the subscription tab for new videos) and Google knows if I watch a video or not. Giving me notifications isn&#39;t changing the fact that I watch something. If all channels ask me to do that, I would have a full inbox but my engagement would not change. Again, I engage with a channel I subbed to, I watch it, Youtube sees this and that should be the end game.

I believe the error lies in the classical method of &quot;dropping&quot; glass into water. Consequently, the hot, fluid glass droplet always has to be somehow seperated from the glass supply, resulting in some tailshape or another. Wether the droplet seperates due to gravity or because it is being manually seperated, it will certainly be impure, meaning it still has a weak spot.<br><br>(Maybe a small enough flaw can be overlooked; it depends on the experiment conducted on it, I have no idea of the real scientific value of having a spherical Rupert&#39;s Drop, apart from being awesome *)<br><br>My thoughts - still disordered from my short brainstorming - include a mixture of acoustic levitation and laserheating. To begin, acoustic levitation (which is a method to make lightweight objects float due to a clever overlapping of soundwaves) gets rid of the need for a &quot;zero gravity&quot; environment. It then is possible to make a small amount of glass - of a diameter of a few millimeters or so - float in mid air. In the next step, I would resort to using some highly powerful lasers to heat this piece of glass to its melting point. The glass will remain in or form a nearly perfect spherical shape in this molten state. Lastly, I would turn off the acoustic levitation device so that the glass can fall into a water tank, solidifying and gaining the well-known strength of a classical Rupert&#39;s Drop. We would receive a nearly perfect spherical Rupert&#39;s Drop with no tail whatsoever.<br><br>What may the benefits of this method be? Well, the most obvious one is a practically flawless Rupert&#39;s Drop. Secondly, I estimate the costs and effort of acousticly levitating and laser heating a piece of glass are lower than getting it on the ISS, correct me if I am wrong.<br><br>What thoughts on your side did my comment spark? I would welcome you commenting &amp; critisizing on this idea of mine! Maybe there will even be a real discussion :D<br><br><br>PS: Although, why not try earning the attention of NASA or so and attempt creating a Rupert&#39;s Drop on the ISS? On a smaller scale, if this experiment is not worthy to replicate in space, maybe try bringing this experiment onto a &quot;Reduced-gravity aircraft&quot; (is it called like that in english? You know, these airplanes flying parabolas to reach short moments of weightlessness?) I mean, some practical input surely is more useful than pure hypothesizing, if possible.<br><br><br>*Well, I am pretty sure it won&#39;t take long till someone comes up with the idea, so I will not go out of my way of addressing it: Maybe you could use these advanced Rupert&#39;s Drops to make weapons and in this case possibly bullets with a much higher strength?

Is it that &quot;pulling&quot; of tension as it hardens, the compression, in the direction of the tail that makes it so strong?

As part of a project to design a Capillary Electrophoresis (CE) DNA sequencer, I was introduced to fused-silica capillary tubing which is made from the purest form of glass.  The capillary tubes we used were 50 microns ID by 360 microns OD, and coated with polyimide polymer for protection from hydrogen embrittlement.  A human hair usually could not fit into the inside of this tubing.  This tubing could be tied in a simple loop-knot and drawn so tight that the loop diameter could be less than 6mm; if you let go of one end, the knot would quickly untie and recover to a straight shape without any kink or curve!  I&#39;ve never seen any metallic wire or microtube do this.  The fused silica seems to be the perfect spring material.<br>Also interesting is the very high dielectric strength of this fused silica, about 4 kV/mm.  Since we used 15 kV for electrophoresis, the tubing could allow a short-circuit through the glass wall when its OD (outside surface) physically contacted a conductive (metallic) electric ground.  The short-circuit would punch a nearly perfect, tiny cylindrical hole straight through the tubing wall without breaking the tube!  Note that the electrical potential was produced with a charged ion-rich DNA separating aqueous solution that filled the tubing, so the short-circuit was from fluid inside to metal on the outside. Early electrophoretic experiments failed because it was very difficult to find the tiny electrical breaches in the glass wall, some only a few microns in diameter.  Only Scanning Electron Microscopic (SEM) images revealed the holes which appeared perfectly round and smooth.  Of course, I learned to fully isolate the tubing from conductors, except at the ends.  Glass is one of the most exotic materials among many I ever used in engineering.", "comment_date": "2016-12-29T23:12:37Z", "likes_count": 114}, {"comment_by": "Christian Lainesse", "comment_text": "I am getting the notification even without doing the unsubscribe/resubscribe thing", "comment_date": "2016-12-29T23:12:01Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Blackcat25:17 IAM", "comment_text": "that was cool\ud83d\ude38\ud83d\udc4d", "comment_date": "2016-12-29T23:11:46Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Zlatan Jakic", "comment_text": "Hey Destin I would like to recomend yo usomke audiobook.
