And the legislature was trying to tax the Penn family lands to pay for frontier defense during the French and Indian War. And the Penn family kept instructing the governor to veto. Franklin felt that this was a great affront to the ability of the legislature to govern. And so he actually meant purchase a little temporary safety very literally. The Penn family was trying to give a lump sum of money in exchange for the General Assembly&#39;s acknowledging that it did not have the authority to tax it.&quot;", "comment_date": "2021-03-07T01:22:26Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "windowboy", "comment_text": "#8 law &amp; order", "comment_date": "2021-02-27T08:07:25Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Bentley Joseph Hamilton", "comment_text": "Sadly things in this amazing country have only declined. \ud83e\udd7a", "comment_date": "2021-02-22T02:35:30Z", "likes_count": 4}, {"comment_by": "Poutrel", "comment_text": "Police encouraging citizens to use their weapons...
