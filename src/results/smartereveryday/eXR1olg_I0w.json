When I first started really trying to do more than a low hover I still remember when it was facing me high in the air hovering and a large gust of wind quickly took it away, I gave it a lot of cyclic to try and bring it back, problem, I pulled the cyclic towards me in a panic(where I wanted it to go, towards me, lol), but obviously it accelerated more because it&#39;s tail was pointing away, unfortunately it got stuck in a high tree because it just happened too fast to correct, it was fine but it was something that I had to practice getting my head around. Right after learning to hover, be aware of where it will go based on it&#39;s orientation relative to myself and try to avoid large cyclic movement if possible because it can go dang fast! I do believe a real helicopter would be easier in that respect because I am always facing the same way as the helicopter and without a collective I was dealing with throttle delay as well, plus I&#39;d have killed to have my hands on collective and cyclic alone and pedals for the tail rotor, seems easier to me but I will never get to try the real thing :-(", "comment_date": "2020-05-17T11:16:32Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Cooper Thorne", "comment_text": "I\u2019ve seen this video before but never realized it was in st.

That prevents the aircraft from spinning in circles due to the torque of the main transmission/gearbox. The pedals allow you to rotate the aircraft 360\u00b0. The collective provides lift by increasing the AOA. The cyclic increases the AOA of only 1 main rotor blade at 90\u00b0 in the direction of cyclic travel. Which every blade that approaches the 90\u00b0 mark will increase aoa then drop back down to less of a degree till it reaches the 90 degree mark again.

He competed in events regularly. At the three radio control clubs he belong to he was also one of the test pilot instructors. I never will forget the first day he flew the helicopter. I think the entire club showed up because nobody at that time had one. Everybody clapped and cheered after the helicopter lifted off the ground. My dad had a real knack for hand eye coordination and responding in a nanosecond. A couple of flights later on the same day he flew the helicopter away from the viewing area for safety sake. Then he put the helicopter to the test. He got the helicopter spinning around on its vertical axis and then pulled up and flew upside down inverted while he flew it around the field. As he came around the turn at the end of the field he right sided the helicopter for a high speed pass down the center of the field. Needless to say when he landed he got a standing ovation.

There was a camera display in the cockpit so I could see my family and anyone else who stopped to watch. I actually got a reaction out of the tech running the sim and it was hilarious.", "comment_date": "2019-08-05T09:12:53Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Preston Garvey", "comment_text": "RIP<br>Always loved and missed by all", "comment_date": "2019-08-04T22:31:18Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Kian", "comment_text": "I don&#39;t know if it&#39;s just me but I don&#39;t have any desire to drive on the road but I dream of flying a helicopter, any helicopter.", "comment_date": "2019-08-04T12:00:33Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Mr. Koz", "comment_text": "Balance a plate on top of a marble is also a good analogy.", "comment_date": "2019-08-04T03:49:40Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "xl", "comment_text": "you make it looks harder than it is.<br>You don&#39;t have to rewire your brain..<br>Neither do rubiks cube users.", "comment_date": "2019-08-02T20:51:14Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "MASADA DENIER", "comment_text": "tfw no helicopter instructor gf", "comment_date": "2019-08-02T18:39:05Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "S N", "comment_text": "I don\u2019t learn to fly a chopper.. but I learnt even Dolphins can have prosthetic tails...", "comment_date": "2019-08-02T18:14:15Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Gutzz151", "comment_text": "They should make the planes like the ones in gta", "comment_date": "2019-08-02T11:06:13Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Seth J", "comment_text": "I&#39;m selling Nmd_xr1 Triple Black size 9 for $150 on the Goat app buy now!", "comment_date": "2019-08-01T18:45:30Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "TechCrunchPro", "comment_text": "As a professional helicopter pilot in battlefield hardline I can certainly say it&#39;s difficult to fly a helicopter.", "comment_date": "2019-08-01T13:03:29Z", "likes_count": 189}, {"comment_by": "prospectnyc", "comment_text": "What a cool sponsorship!

Ie the engine fails in flight, you disengage the rotors from the engine so they can freely spin then turn down your collective so you get more spin s the air flows over them and just before you crash, as the rotors are spinning fast, you slowly raise the collective to soften your landing (not too much or the rotors stop spinning).

I was in Scotland a few months ago in a large rented camper van, 30&#39; long, 8&#39; wide; trying to drive it on roads that were about 9&#39; wide, and almost randomly varying in width, with sharp dropoffs at the edge of the pavement. My son was the passenger. He was freaking out, I did everything I could to keep from taking off the mirrors. It didn&#39;t turn out well, I took off a mirror on a bus sticking out into the road when an oncoming car swerve just over the centerline.  Then my son took over. He&#39;s a better but less experienced driver than me. I&#39;d made some really basic errors, like not looking farther down the road to drive straight (this is like your pilot induced oscillations). So he took over driving. What I quickly noticed was that sitting in that front passenger seat was scary. Short front on the Fiat truck body. As he&#39;d done for me, I could look into the side mirror and see the white line at the edge of the road. What I&#39;d figured out to do was ONLY tell him when he was good, about 6-12&quot; inside that white line. My goal was to set up a positive feedback loop. Of course if I thought he was really going to hit something I&#39;d say something. Within an hour he had dialed in that edge of the road. Then I would only give positive feedback when he had to squeeze over for oncoming traffic.  So my driving problems from him freaking out? Not his fault. It was just a standard driving situation that normal human responses made worse. I got into a negative feedback loop.  The biggest issue (after renting a vehicle wider than the roads) was my not looking down the road. The take away was using positive feedback.  In a helicopter the instructors have to do what they have to do. But my point is, if possible,  look for a way to input only positive feedback. This way your brain gets a little &#39;ping&#39; when you&#39;re doing it right and then that&#39;s what you learn. <br>The term you&#39;re looking for is Automaticity. Also, in general women teach skills differently than men, of course everybody is slightly different from everybody else. The point is not to get in some debate, but to find an instructor or teacher who is good at it and then trying to figure out as many things that they are doing that make them good. With teaching people how to use a computer the general tendency of guys was to show you, the women instructors I observed got you to do it. Pretty basic.  An experiment with positive and negative feedback loops would probably be interesting. A balancing skill, like maybe slack lining, might be  good for this. You&#39;d have to figure out a way to make one balancing skill negative feedback driven, you keep falling off, and a slightly different skill, positive feedback driven: you don&#39;t fall off, but get steadier and steadier.", "comment_date": "2018-09-03T16:34:40Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "fernando13e", "comment_text": "Great video, been flying helicopters for a long time...

It takes us  years to learn to do it (walk) , but once you do it, you can do it without thinking about it, even when drunk or tired. Making a helicopter an extension of your body also takes much practice, but is also no harder to do than walking.<br><br>And yes, everything you do, you are doing with cyclic, collective, throttle, and rudder, but it&#39;s the same with walking. If you lean forward while standing, what happens? You start to tip. What do you do? Do you &quot;lean back*? No you take a step which converts the leaning motion, into forward motion. As you step out, your body drops, so you compensate by heel toeing and by moving the other leg in. Need to stop? You begin leaning back and taking shorter steps to bleed off momentum. You balance with your arms as well. Need to turn quickly, the turn starts at your feet, making you fall in a circle, not at your arms or head. So you are doing multiple things at once, to move in a coordinated fashion. Coordinated is key, when you increase collective, you increase rotational resistance, which makes the heli want to piroette, so you apply rudder to compensate for that. It also causes rotor speed to drop, which you apply throttle for, and finally the blip in rudder pushes the entire heli to one side thanks to the tail rotor, so you compensate with a little cyclic input. Moving one requires moving all 4. After doing this awhile though, it&#39;s 2nd nature and you don&#39;t even think about it. The same way you don&#39;t think about every movement of your leg muscles, pelvis, arms, head, and eyes when walking around an obstacle.", "comment_date": "2018-05-17T03:11:52Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "derjoh1986", "comment_text": "Always wanted to do this!!

If you watch the terrain too close to you, it&#39;s a disaster. When you figure out how not to, it comes into focus. Instructors told me back then a LOT of asian students were coming to AZ (I&#39;m in CA), and most didn&#39;t solo until about 60 hours (got my license at 70). The vast majority of them would fly the ship right into the ground unless the instructor took over, despite screaming and yelling at them to &quot;flare&quot;. Apparently they had a really hard time transferring what they read in class to real world. They would fixate and freeze up.

Thanks for the video. I love all your helicopter videos. I understand\u00a0most of the\u00a0physics except this.

I sort of get that. But, once the helicopter has settled into forward flight, why do you still need to maintain that lift 90 degrees to the right? (My understanding is that gyroscopic force only happens when you try to change the axis of rotation, so, once the axis of rotation of the blades has settled down, to fly forward, shouldn&#39;t the lift be at the back of the helicopter (so the 90 degree offset collective would now have to be to the left?).

Collective changes the pitch on the main rotor blades by an equal (collective) amount. This controls how much lift spinning blades (called a disc) creates. When lift equals weight, the helicopter will remain at a given height. If the lift is greater than the weight, the helicopter will rise, if it is less, it will descend.<br><br>The cyclic varies the pitch of the blades throughout each 360 degree revolution (each cycle), and this controls the attitude off the disc. The attitude of the disc tilts the lift in the desired direction- forward to go forward, laterally to move to the side.<br><br>For any given amount of lift (force), the helicopter will try to spin in the opposite direction to the rotation of the blades (Newton&#39;s third law), and the thrust of the tail rotor can be adjusted with the pedals to generate an equal force in the opposite direction to keep the helicopter straight. Of course as lift (collective) increases, drag increases, and the engine must generate more power to maintain a constant main rotor RPM. <br><br>Every helicopter control has primary and secondary effects. The primary effect of collective is altitude, the secondary effects are power (torque), yaw (turning effect) and attitude. The primary effect of cyclic is airspeed, the secondary effect is altitude. The primary effect of pedals is heading (balance) the secondary effect is power (increases with greater pedal input). These all combine to permit a heavier than air aircraft to take off vertically, cruise at 200kmh, then land as gently as a leaf on a tiny helipad. Slow, rough and expensive, but as Igor Sikorsky, the grand daddy of helicopters said, &#39;helicopters will do a job that no other aircraft can do&#39;.", "comment_date": "2015-11-22T11:44:22Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "John Violidakis", "comment_text": "+SmarterEveryDay &quot;If you feel like this video earned it, feel free to click the outtakes and subscribe to Smarter Every Day&quot; Oh, too bad I&#39;ve already done this and can&#39;t subscribe twice!!", "comment_date": "2015-11-22T11:41:11Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Andre Vieira", "comment_text": "I know you probably hear this a lot and you might have started to see it as just a way of compliment, but I want you to know that I mean exactly what I&#39;m writing here.

So then, when I&#39;m actually solving the cube later and I see that same pattern, my brain recognizes the pattern, and then my hands do the rest.

Imagine the plate like a rail, and the rotor guide rods, the cart. When you move the cyclic, the plate tilts the swash in the respective direction of the control input. The cart, traveling along the rail, eiter goes uphill or downhill depending on how you set the track. As in, cyclically, the blade which connector rod is traveling along the rail, pivots on it&#39;s axis, levered by the connecting rod going up or down on the swashplate track. As it travels, it gradually changes the angle of attack on the blade, making the lift higher where the angle of the blade is higher. the resulting difference in lift generates torque, wich is why the aircraft tilts in the desired direction.<br>The same goes for the collective, only that it changes the pitch of all blades collectivelly, increasing overall lift and making the craft go up. Just like how the tail rotor works, only in a different application. Also, like an airplane propeller changes it&#39;s pitch to optimize engine rpm and the bite it takes of the atmosphere.<br>You don&#39;t actually control the engine directly, it is optimized for a given rpm for better fuel efficiency and safety (as the large diameter of the rotor could make the tip of the blade reach transonic speeds, wich creates turbulence, flutter and may stall the blade, as well of a ton of drag). What happens is that the increase in the angles of attack also increase drag on the blades. And that is where the counterrotating torque comes from.", "comment_date": "2015-11-20T20:17:01Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Nostromo", "comment_text": "I adore Helicopters.

If the engine fails on a helicopter, there aren&#39;t any wings to slow your descent. So my question is why are helicopter engines more reliable? Is it the difference in the engines themselves? Does it have to do with the way in which the engines operate (i.e., stick an airplane engine in a helicopter and it will increase its reliability because of the type of work it has to do, and vice versa)? Is it that the redundancy of the wings on a basic single prop airplane means that the maintenance requirements are lower than those of a helicopter engine?
