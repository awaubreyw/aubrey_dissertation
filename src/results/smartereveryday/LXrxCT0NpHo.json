In a vice grip the paraboloid is the release mechanism for the energy stored in a spring inside the device.  From your explanation of the Mantis Shrimp, it sounds like the paraboloid is what stores the energy itself and the release or trigger is a different mechanism.  Am I understanding this correctly?  I love being able to relate your videos to things I can play with, so when you mentioned the tool I ran and grabbed a few pairs I had to play with and compare the mechanisms, but I came away even more confused than before.

Lots of time for it to come up with incredibly good designs.<br><br>Second, evolution is not chaos. It&#39;s different. It&#39;s random mutations where the bad ones are (usually brutally) beaten out of the system and the beneficial ones last a lot longer. Ones which have no effect generally just... stick around.<br><br>Now, evolution IS slow, but as I said, 3.6 billion years. That&#39;s a long time even on a cosmological scale. That is 3.6 billion years of the bad stuff being kicked out and the useful stuff being kept and constantly refined. THAT&#39;S why there&#39;s so many systems in biology we cannot replicate and haven&#39;t come up with. Nor are we at the limit of our technology. We&#39;re improving, and one day we&#39;ll end up surpassing nature in nearly every respect (if we live that long).<br><br>Saying it disproves evolution isn&#39;t a good argument, it&#39;s a wilful admission that you don&#39;t have a clue about what you&#39;re arguing against.<br><br>Also, we&#39;ve done a number of experiments that have proven that evolution exists. If you dismiss that as God testing us, I&#39;m not interested, because that&#39;s the worst cop-out I&#39;ve heard.<br><br>The experiments? There&#39;s two I can think of off the top of my head: In TWO MONTHS, researchers created multicellular yeast by doing nothing but selecting for heavier samples (removing the lightest ones and letting the heaviest grow) and the E.

Even with millions of years and &quot;tiny mutations over time of trial and error&quot;, it still doesn&#39;t stand to reason. I am grappling with how this &quot;evolution&quot; happens. I&#39;ve seen a documentary (\u201cWhat Plants Talk About\u201d) that when Tobacco plants are attacked and eaten by bugs, the plant then releases a chemical that attracts the predator of that particular bug. So the plant saves itself by calling for help. How is that possible? How does the plant even &quot;sense&quot; what chemicals bugs put off? It has no chemical receptors. It has no brain. It has no nervous system. And how does it keep up with the chemical changes in other bug species. How does it know that a particular bug eats another bug? And please don&#39;t say &quot;Time&quot; and &quot;mutations&quot; or &quot;God&quot;.

The mantis shrimps (stomatopods) can have up to 12 photoreceptors, far more than needed for even extreme color acuity. Thoen et al. (p. 411; see the Perspective by Land and Osorio) conducted paired color discrimination tests with stomatopods and found that their ability to discriminate among colors was surprisingly low. Instead, stomatopods appear to use a color identification approach that results from a temporal scan of an object across the 12 photoreceptor sensitivities. This entirely unique form of vision would allow for extremely rapid color recognition without the need to discriminate between wavelengths within a spectrum&quot;<br><br><a href=\"http://www.sciencemag.org/content/343/6169/411\">http://www.sciencemag.org/content/343/6169/411</a>", "comment_date": "2014-09-03T04:00:56Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Kindanyume .Kindanyume", "comment_text": "What about that demo only vs a non-shelled fish?... closer to\u00a0typical\u00a0human\u00a0flesh.<br><br><br>Oh and she&#39;s very cute IMO! \u00a0 &gt;:)~", "comment_date": "2014-09-03T03:56:25Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "phenli", "comment_text": "I actually happen to be eating some hyperbolic paraboloids when I clicked on this video.
