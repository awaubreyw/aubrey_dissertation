You said at one point that you were ready to continue on to the Pacific.  When I was a teen in the late eighties I had the opportunity to go out on a cruise in a nuclear fast attack sub.  Heading on to the ship I had one question I wanted the answer to.  When I had the chance to meet the captain I presented my question...&quot;When a nuclear sub is transiting the north pole submerged you can steer north until you reach the pole.  But once you are there your compass just spins, any where you steer is south.  How do you know where to go?&quot;  He looked at me for a few seconds and then said, &quot;I don&#39;t know.&quot;  He took me to the navigator and asked him.  The answer, &quot;I don&#39;t know.&quot;  Even as a kid I could see that they had never thought about it and felt a little silly not knowing the answer.  We asked several other people until finally we opened a door to a room not much larger than a phone booth.  There was a man standing in there, I don&#39;t know what his tittle was, and we presented my question.  He had the answer and it was quite a simple one.  Maybe things are different now but I remember thinking at the time that if I was on a sub going over the pole, whether I was the cook or the captain,  I would want to know the answer to that question.

If,  after sub duty,  you can still go to college on the GI.  This opens up doors inside and outside the military. <br><br>What I recalled is the asvab scores needed to be high.  I didn&#39;t study at all, just showed, got a 89.  It wasn&#39;t difficult.  Easier than an ACT for college (or SAT I would guess, didn&#39;t take that one), but the same style.  You just need to be a little sharper than most.  <br><br>At the recruiter&#39;s office, this is when they will show you these &quot;fun&quot; videos.  They want you coming out ready to sign.  At my time,  they had a big sign on bonuses to seal the deal.  Get through AIT, and a fat check for thousands shows up after your &quot;normal&quot; funds.  If this still applies today, it is tempting.  You&#39;ll find your bank account with more than you know what to do with. <br><br>If you want this life, there a world of unclassified information. And pictures worth thousand, right?<br><br>Understand there is a little more about life, and more so with life on a sub.  Many of the men you seen, have a wife and a few little ones at &quot;home&quot;.  The wife&#39;s get used to hanging out with other navy wives, and the kids get used to daddy missing holidays and birthdays,  while he does &quot;his job&quot;.  That&#39;s military life.  Some grew up with this and it is normal.  But it takes a special kind of relationship with the wife&#39;s/SO.  Strong bond of trust.  And then you come home, the special first moments with your kids are a tear jerker.  And a huge flood of them telling about their lives.  Just reconnecting.  wife&#39;s/SO waits for her time to reconnect.  But, after a few months,  this will be followed with another sad goodbye.  Then you refocus on your job.  &quot;home&quot; goes into their routine.  <br><br>This is an awesome career if you are offered the chance.  I recommend to do it.  It is hard work, but you will learn teamwork. You will learn the Navy top technology. Which will never be spoken.    If you decide, afterward your tour, not be your path, you will walk away with so much more.  Or, you decide to sign up a another boat or two, and you could be sitting at the XO table.", "comment_date": "2022-05-08T01:17:01Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "G S", "comment_text": "Excellent job explaining breaking through the ice.

Ballast tanks are, or should be, void of air when operating submerged. Their sole purpose is to provide buoyancy in order to float the ship. Trim tanks are used to control the submarine&#39;s buoyancy when submerged; overall trim, fore and aft trim and list. Water is pumped around and out to sea, and flooded in to control these. This is the job of the Diving Officer and the Ballast Control Panel Officer. The trim tanks are hard tanks, able to be exposed to full sea pressure. The ballast tanks are always open to the sea via vents on the bottoms. Air inside the ballast tank is detrimental as it compresses and causes instability because the deeper you go the heavier you get.

I&#39;m a navy fan,  I love learning about navy things.   I thought i knew a reasonable amount about what it&#39;s like in a submarine.   And I&#39;ve watched &quot;Hunt for Red October&quot; more than once.   What i must thank you for is  getting yourself into that submarine and for getting footage that shows us what it&#39;s like for real,  but without treating us like we&#39;re grade school children (which is how these sorts of things often turn out).     You were half expecting to be treated with a lot of caution and skepticism by the Navy, and I&#39;d have thought that was normal.  But no.   You hit on the magic ingredient, I think.   You worked on your relationships with everyone in the navy you came in contact with and as a result they treated you as an adult, and trusted you not to get them all into strife over blabbing too much.     I am in awe of how well you trod that fine line between poking your nose into every little corner  and  keeping away from things they need to keep classified.      What you ended up with is a more comprehensive and fascinating view of submarine life and operations than I&#39;ve ever heard of or seen.    That represents skill on your part for managing the technical aspects of movie making,  as well as all the relatiohships that could easily have turned sour at any moment with a poorly chosen word on your part.     And your explanations throughout both disguised edits where there was material they didnt want shown and helped me understand what was going on.

So did I understood correctly that if there would be need to go into maximum depth as fast as possible in maximum velocity, it would impose great danger to lose propulsion, if the planes and ballast tanks wouldn&#39;t happened to be within certain control margins? I mean losing propulsion could lead into sinking the vessel? I assume that changing/controlling ballasts nearing maximum depth can&#39;t be made very fast as that would jeopardize integrity of the hull? Also just realized that losing propulsion suddenly is likely always bit dangerous event as I guess it effects quite a bit in the roll of vessel and I suppose there really can&#39;t be too much roll or control is lost completely?<br><br> I&#39;ve always thought when people are saying that flying is hard and that there&#39;s difficult physics there, that controlling submarines or ships aren&#39;t easy either. Airplanes move fast, but on ocean many people seem to forget that there&#39;s usually quite a lot of masses involved and to be controlled. I once followed one cruise ship from online service that had lost it&#39;s rudder control. It happened in quite bad spot as they obviously needed to control ship for some time with basically just propulsion.

People always ask, \u201chow long will your air last?\u201d It depends on your depth.  To maintain neutral buoyancy at depth will require a great intake of air to maintain the same bubble size.  If you had the capability to add air to the Cartesian diver as you squeezed the bottle, your diver would maintain the same depth in the bottle.  Hence, that said, to maintain neutral buoyancy at 10 meters would be 10 times greater than if you were at 1meter.  Subsequently as the diver ascends, the air in the ballast tanks, (lungs) needs some place to go as the volume would continue to increase.  That is the primary reason why we teach to never hold your breath while diving.  <br>We also have an additional ballast tank which we call the BCD, buoyancy control device.  Maintaining attitude at depth can be quite difficult at depth.  As with the submarine you cannot just increase the pressure in the living space, we add air to the balloon on our back (BCD) to help maintain neutral buoyancy.  But, as we ascend we need to bleed air from the BCD, and our lungs to control our ascent, and to be able to tweak our depth (neutral buoyancy) once e have ascended to our desired depth.  Once on the surface, in a sub, they would blow all remaining water, the scuba diver would add air to the BCD.", "comment_date": "2021-12-09T18:43:34Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Chris From SouthAus", "comment_text": "Wait, so subs actually make the &quot;arooga&quot; sound when they dive.

It&#39;s not easy living in those conditions and being away from your family / loved ones for so long, and under such conditions of isolation.  I disagree with a lot of what the US military is asked to do around the world, especially when it comes to the interventions / occupations of iraq and afghanistan.  I absolutely hate to see all of the hard work and wealth and LIVES squandered in unnecessary conflict.  However, I also do believe and acknowledge that the navy and in particular, nuclear submarines, serve a necessary purpose.  Without nuclear submarines, America is less safe, because they form a vital part of nuclear deterrence.  And I really do believe that nuclear deterrence is probably one of the few key factors preventing another world war.  With all that said, I wish that the US would refrain from engaging in immoral or unjustified conflicts around the world in the future, and stay focused on defending the homeland.", "comment_date": "2021-08-24T23:04:39Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "wongfou", "comment_text": "Thanks, that was awesome", "comment_date": "2021-08-24T22:51:41Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "zanshibumi", "comment_text": "I&#39;m half way in, and this is better than most movies I&#39;ve watched this year.", "comment_date": "2021-08-24T21:23:29Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Pavel Adamek", "comment_text": "Watching this literal teamwork makes me wonder whether all the yelling and hazing in boot camp was necessary.", "comment_date": "2021-08-24T21:12:06Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Noblesse Oblige", "comment_text": "Have a serious issue with the military, but i had to put that aside for a moment and just marvel at the engineering required to pull all that off.

You can see this demonstrated in the Stargate: Continuum movie where they do just that when extracting a SPECOPS unit and the special features of that movie document this with actual footage of the exercise both on and off the sub.  This included a dive team in the water filming the sub punching through from the ocean perspective and a team filming it punch through from the surface perspective, and some of it made it in the movie as well as the captain and crew of USS Alexandria (SSN 757) were extras during ICEX-07 from 23-29 March 2007 around Prudhoe Bay, Alaska.<br><br>Surface ships have expansion joints that allow the ship to expand and contract similar to subs and bridges; also the pipe fittings, wiring harnesses, etc. (fuel/water lines, fire mains, etc.) at those joints are flexible instead of rigid to allow the full range of expansion without any damage.  Without these expansion joints the ship would incur structural damage due to temperature variations because metal expands in hot climates and retracts in cold climates and ships are constantly going between those two regions all the time. <br><br>On the bridge of a surface ship it&#39;s strictly business as well especially during restricted maneuvering when leaving/entering port, CONREP (connected replenishment) evolutions, and flight operations.

Not to mention the bomb (O2 generator) and scrubbers as covered in prior episodes sending waste overboard - plus sanitaries and bilge tanks in the engine room - which is all coordinated thru the dive - all of that has to be accounted for in addition to the trim (what the act of getting a hover is called)  New boats like the toledo have computers and stuff to do alot of those calculations for the crew - older 637&#39;s that I was on, was all manual - DOOW did those calculations in his head using thumbrules and seat of the pants experience.", "comment_date": "2021-08-03T23:43:05Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Bekoni Pasta", "comment_text": "I wish there was videos like this when i was a kid.", "comment_date": "2021-08-03T23:39:58Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Kevin", "comment_text": "Uss Requin.

HERE IS MY QUESTION !!!...in all of my years (more than 50) I have never heard the term &quot;sail&quot; used to describe that area of a sub. I&#39;ve heard the term conning tower used but never &quot;sail&quot;...Due to you having to climb up the sail only to navigate down a ladder once atop of the sail to enter inside of the sub... while layered like the little brother in The Christmas Story...it sparked a thought QUESTION...since the hatch on the sail was opened to allow people out and back in...realizing the compartment is secured and would assume airtight doors were closed while the hatch was open...I also assume the air temp inside the sail&#39;s compartment or entry compartment was sub-zero but temps no were as cold as they were outside of the sub...realizing hot air rises and again I assume the humidity levels within the sub are well controlled including having humidity within the sail&#39;s entry compartment...I&#39;m curious why did not see or notice any venting of steam or heat coming from the hatch or anywhere in that area...had it all escaped, dissipated..is the outside temps simply too cold...just curious why no &quot;steaming&quot; from clothing or the &quot;metal&quot; itself... I probably made absolutely no sense but hopefully been around us Aubs enough will be able to decipher...<br><br>PS.

The deeper the boat, the more air pressure the engineer will have to add to the ballast tanks to get them to blow at depth.

That&#39;s 80,000 lbs per square inch tensile strength, and the hull is roughly 3 inches thick. Do the math...<br><br>Also, as a boat dives, there really isn&#39;t too much of a Cartesian Diver effect. That&#39;s because there are actually two different types of sea water tanks on submarines: ballast tanks (which are free flooding from the bottom, and vented via hydraulically controlled valves on the top to flood them or let water in as they let air out; and they&#39;re drained by closing the vents, and blowing air into them, thus forcing water out the bottom), and <b>trim</b> tanks which are within the pressure hull, and are filled or emptied via pumps. These are the tanks that get filled or emptied to achieve neutral bouyancy. There is typically one forward, one aft, and one or more amidships. Once a boat is completely submerged, the ballast tank vents are usually left open to avoid trapping air or other gasses in them, and thus affecting the trim. They might be closed in a &quot;rig for ultra quiet&quot; scenario, to avoid the gurgle of escaping gas, but generally they&#39;re left open. The neutral bouyancy and zero degree bubble are then achieved by pumping sea water into (or out of) the appropriate trim tanks.<br><br>Oh, and there is an upward-looking sonar that can show both the distance to the ice, as well as the thickness of the ice.

While there are subs with view ports or acrylic bubbles that allow you to see out, but most subs don&#39;t. Even with the advanced imaging of the sonar dome and sat based navigation, (if I remember correctly) subs primarily navigate with a clock, a map under a piece of glass, a ruler, and a grease pen. It&#39;s like trying to drive around town in a car where every window is blacked out, and all you have is the speedometer, a stopwatch, a compass, and a map. You know you&#39;re starting out at point X,Y on the map, you want to arrive at point Xdest,Ydest by the end, and you have a series of way points to navigate through. Each time you reach a waypoint, you have to calculate the angle of the next turn and how long you should run in that direction at the set speed you&#39;re going. Mess up, and you run aground or into something. Granted, in the deep oceans, running into things isn&#39;t too much of a problem. But let&#39;s say the mission has the sub in coastal waters where they&#39;re trying to slide around commercial shipping, other militaries, and any nosy citizens unobserved.<br><br>If you want proof of that, did you notice that the deck officer running the sub during it&#39;s surfacing move was using a stop watch?", "comment_date": "2021-07-31T14:29:58Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "J.M.

As a prototype machinist in the aerospace industry going for my mechanical engineering. This gives me drive to keep going. Knowing what we can accomplish when we engineer systems to perfection. From the making of 02... to operating the reactors, loading the torpedo&#39;s, controlling pitch/roll/yaw and ascent rates as well as decent rates its just mind blowing how much knowledge is on that ship. All of those men seem very intelligent and very humble. I don&#39;t have it in me to be on that ship I don&#39;t think.

This is probably why the sub can&#39;t translate sideways, as just a set of bow thrusters combined with rudder and main engine thrust would allow you to do something very close to that kind of movement.", "comment_date": "2021-07-31T06:27:06Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "xNAUGHTYPANDAx", "comment_text": "Thanks jody!", "comment_date": "2021-07-31T06:26:28Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "beartastic", "comment_text": "No email for this one?", "comment_date": "2021-07-31T06:26:02Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "David Ferrand", "comment_text": "Cool to see you were in the &#39;Burgh!", "comment_date": "2021-07-31T06:25:48Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Luke Charters", "comment_text": "Next episode is battleship", "comment_date": "2021-07-31T06:24:35Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "fasfan", "comment_text": "I spent 4 1/2 years in the Navy on submarines.

For that process, the ship that the carrier is getting supplies from sets and locks their speed.  The carrier then approaches the supply ship and has to make tiny corrections to maintain speed.  A carrier has 4 screws.  The forward reactor controls 1 and 4 (the outside ones) and the aft reactor controls 2 and 3 (the inside ones).  One of the two plants (I think it was the forward reactor plant) sets their speed and the throttlemen (the ones that control the throttle valve that feeds steam into the main engines) take their hands off their hand wheels.  The after reactor plant then handles the minute changes to speed to keep us alongside the supply vessel.  There are times when the bridge orders a change in the number of propeller RPMs 20 times per second, just to keep us alongside.  Anyways, I know the sub experience is a lot more intense, but that tiny portion where &quot;NAV&quot; is calling slight bell changes rapidly reminded me of the UNREP.", "comment_date": "2021-07-31T02:00:33Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "nick4819", "comment_text": "The next military series.....THE KING OF THE NAVY....THE AIRCRAFT CARRIER!!

They have an upper and lower crankshaft and 2 pistons per cylinder that come very close together to pressurize the diesel / air mixture the pressure that causes the mixture to ignite. In the late 70&#39;s and 80&#39;s a company converted them to natural gas service and we used them to compress natural gas and sometimes propane. Some were turbocharged.

Thank you, Destin!  I&#39;m emotional after watching this... for a few reasons.  1. I miss my U.S. Navy.  2. With the constant barrage of negative information coming from mainstream media sources about our U.S. Military (hard hitting news = negative news) it&#39;s refreshing to see them shown in an unbiased form which displays their dedication and professionalism.  3. With all the questionable personalities on YouTube these days, it&#39;s refreshing to watch something hosted by a man of genuine integrity and concern for the value he brings to his viewers.  Destin, I know the extra cash must help to care for your family, but it should be clear to anyone who watches you that you would do this for $0.  Bravo Zulu my friend! <br><br>A word about these submariners (side fact: they call themselves &#39;sub mah-reen ers&#39;, not &#39;sub mare-in ers&#39;, also subs are boats, carriers are ships) Boat Captains are the most amazing people that you&#39;ll never hear about.  You can have 3 Engineering degrees and know how every system on the boat works down to the bolt, but never come close to being a Boat Captain.  You can be as good at managing people as a fortune 500 CEO, but never come close to being a Boat Captain.  You can be cool as a cucumber while under enormous stress while being shot at, but never come close to being a Boat Captain.  You can be such a great strategist that you&#39;re a chess master, but never come close to being a Boat Captain.  If you want to be a Boat Captain you&#39;ll have to be ALL those things, without exception.  They are (mostly) extraordinarily complex and eccentric individuals, and very daunting to interact with.<br><br>Where each Boat Captain is the equivalent of Mozart, each member of the crew is as skilled as a 1st chair in the Vienna Philharmonic.  Now, you&#39;re saying to yourself &quot;how is that possible, how do they find those people?&quot;  The answer is the Dolphin Pin.  The Cook from a U.S. Navy boat could blow your mind with their level knowledge.  Everyone aboard who has any level of responsibility must have their Dolphins.  To get that pin is nearly impossible.  Imagine what you went through to get your college degree..  but you have 6 majors and have to study 18hrs a day 7days a week for months at a time with no break.  If you don&#39;t get your Dolphins you can&#39;t stay on the boat.  The Navy will find something easier for you to do.  That&#39;s one reason we&#39;re so much better than the competition... it&#39;s not even close.  No CNN, not even the Russians.<br><br>Put it this way; Destin showed that there are an amazing number of complexities and variables involved with buoyancy.  These people get it right 100% of the time.. and they can do it while getting shot at or while there&#39;s a fire aboard... 100% of the time.  Your U.S. Navy Submariners are so skilled, and our equipment is so capable, that we routinely follow enemy subs, *right on their tail*, for weeks without them knowing it.  One author described Subsurface Warfare as &quot;knife fighting in a phonebooth while blindfolded ... in slow motion&quot;.  With that in mind, the U.S. Navy is Bruce Lee.<br><br>There are a few audio books that I&#39;d recommend in addition to Thunder Down Below.  They&#39;re all on Audible.
