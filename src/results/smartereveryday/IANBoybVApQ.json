Applications could be in sports medicine, battlefield technology, shoe sole inserts, and insulated glove inserts; where improved circulation is needed. since the field to move a blood cell is not large , it may be possible to encode the field design into magnet-impregnated polymer sheets for flexibility or into mylar tape for use as a limb wrap.

Flip the magnetic coupling 90 degrees, rotated around the axis, and you have a magnetically locked but never-touching torsional power transmission shaft.<br>3.  Extension and retraction for an ink pen - provides nice magnetic cushion in extended mode!<br>4.  Self-aligning Docking Ring for spacecraft.  In this implementation, perhaps six to dozens are used, located around the docking ring, and linked by a large gear that turns them simultaneously.  In the first position, they&#39;re attracted, but there&#39;s no bump due to the spring effect.  Then, when they&#39;re all rotated, they attract and tightly align the docking rings.  Subsequent mechanical clamps finish the job due to the pressure and large forces involved.", "comment_date": "2019-01-15T10:11:29Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "False-Set", "comment_text": "Evva MCS is an interesting lock that uses polymagnets in the key.", "comment_date": "2019-01-14T20:49:33Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "BHU1", "comment_text": "Can you erase the design on the polymagnet?", "comment_date": "2019-01-14T16:25:30Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "frags", "comment_text": "lil harry potter", "comment_date": "2019-01-13T17:03:24Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Timothy Johnson", "comment_text": "Imagine running these with an electric field among the magnetic field.

The arrays are precisely spaced to produce a pattern of magnetic flow (flux lines) between the magnets, creating a complex field gradient of magnetic energy utilising multiple polarities and flux. EQL magnetic Technology Equilateral Magnetic Technology uses a patented design that increases the magnetic surface activity through a hexagonal array of equilateral triangles, each an alternating north or south pole magnet. This multiplies the number of positive and negative poles, thus creating more lines of magnetic flux. In turn, this maximises the magnetic and geometric complexity for a static field on a flat surface, so that the positioning of the surface is relevant to the object against which it is positioned and creates a uniform magnetic design from edge to edge. <br>Dynamic Magnetic Technology. A dynamic magnetic field is more complex than a static field and our massage products use this technology to create a deeply penetrating three-dimensional moving magnetic field. Magnetic Tension Technologies. Nikken\u2019s latest technical developments are the patented Magnetic Tension Technologies, which start to bring some of the 3-dimensional complexity of the Dynamic Technology into a static form and come in three different configurations: <br>\u2022 RAM\u2122 (Radial-Axis Magnetism) Technology modules feature circular clusters of six small magnetic spheres, with each positive-negative axis rotated 60 degrees relative to its neighbour in a stepped alignment that produce a series of overlapping magnetic fields in tension. <br>\u2022 SpyderRAM\u2122 modules use the same magnetic arrangement but at a larger scale for use in a larger context such as KenkoSeats. <br>\u2022 DynaFlux\u00ae Technology positions magnetic surfaces with the same polar orientation, either positive or negative, opposite each other at multiple points. Interlocking construction holds these components in place, overcoming the repulsion generated by this arrangement, and specially designed magnets prevent demagnetisation which would otherwise occur. Placing separate magnetic fields in opposition produces a multiplier effect, increasing the magnetic strength and the depth of the field, taking magnetic complexity in a static device almost to dynamic levels", "comment_date": "2017-07-11T14:21:21Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Rap Ramos", "comment_text": "that guy is too modest for his creation", "comment_date": "2017-07-11T13:28:26Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Jeffrey Oakford", "comment_text": "I would like to see a combination lock.

Only, instead of using electromagnets for the rotary propulsion, it could be made specifically so that once the spin is started, the magnetic repulsion of the opposite magnetic polarity of one of the stationary magnets wouldn&#39;t be strong enough to stop the motion of the spinning magnet, and in fact leaves it with enough force to spin to the other side of the same magnetic polarity of one of the stationary magnets, in which the same polarities would result in the increased  propulsion of the spinning magnets, so that each passing of the same magnetic polarity would increase the rotational speed of the spinning magnet.

Seeing as they are so small and close together, they have a dense field. of course i dont think you would use a solid iron block. I suppose the best way to do it is to have maybe an aluminum block with an iron plate in side of it. this way the inner polls could pass their flux through the hidden iron plate and the outer polls risk no flux straying due to being in close proximity to a magnetic metal.

Also i think these magnets could help the astronauts working for nasa a lot. You could add magnets that you could then use some type of magnet item to grab onto things and lock in.

Perhaps with the right pattern magnets could also be used for propulsion, sort of BLDC linear motor, as in Maglev propulsion.", "comment_date": "2016-03-27T23:52:22Z", "likes_count": 4}, {"comment_by": "ZenoDiac", "comment_text": "Polymagnet is awesome", "comment_date": "2016-03-27T20:50:37Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Liv Lupton", "comment_text": "MAGNETIC SPACE ELEVATOR MAGNETIC SPACE ELEVATOR<br>MAGNETIC SPACE ELEVATOR", "comment_date": "2016-03-27T20:49:42Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Phillip D.", "comment_text": "Oh, that is a definite game changer.

I love it! Another example of how encoding information in material leads to emergent behaviour. If you think these magnets are cool you should investigate amino acids that make up proteins. <br>In the magnetic case you have a binary information: N or s. In the amino acid case you have twenty different amino acids with different properties. By putting together lots of amino acids into different sequences you get three dimensional structures that all interact in weird and wonderful ways! Just like the printed magnets.<br><br>This is how biology self assembles into living stuff!! You could make chains of these magnets and allow them to &quot;fold up&quot; into larger structures. Eg print out twenty or so different patterns onto a standard block that can connect to other standard blocks (the backbone). The variations in patterns will modify how the structure folds.<br>You want primary patterns which are strong and hold the chain together. And weaker patterns which modify the close range details. By switching the order if the library of twenty blocks you will create super structures with a wide range of properties! <br>The larger structures will face emergent properties of their own like proteins! Self building buildings; transformers.... Robots in disguise...<br>Each chain will, in general, have many configurations. Some will be more stable than others..... But you should be able to flip conformations very easily! You could use thus to make it easier to recycle stuff... Or remove components from OEM systems... <br>Open source the patterns!

In the harmonica world there are basically two main types of harmonicas, diatonics (blues harmonica) and chromatics (they have the button).  There are a few other less common harps- tremolos, chord harps, etc.<br><br>There is one particularly neat harp though, made by Turboharp, that takes a stainless steel reeded harmonica from Seydel and puts a button on it- but instead of blocking the airflow in a chromatic the button pushes magnets closer to the reeds, which changes how quickly they swing (which changes their pitch).  Right now it only works on the &#39;blow&#39; reeds directly (I think the way the harmonica is laid out adding them to the draw reeds is going to be a challenge).  Just changing the blow reeds lets you change the draw bends (draw bends can be bent between the pitch of the two reeds in the hole, and on hole 7 and up blow reeds a draw reeds switch which one is the higher of the two notes.)<br><br>The Turboharp is a clever piece of engineering that exploits the weird dynamics inside the harmonica by disrupting things with magnets.  This might open other options.  Can you print a magnet like this onto a bendable surface?<br><br>And that&#39;s just the harmonica stuff.  You could do funky things with speakers if you could change how certain parts interacted with the energy running through it.<br><br>Or how about key locks, where not only does the key have to be the right shape for the lock, but the right parts of the key have to have the right polarity.  (You could, I suppose, just have a blank cylinder with a pattern that physically repelled certain pistons in the lock.  I think I saw something like this, but it was big and on a clunky scale.  They say that with decent camera you can get a picture of someones&#39; keys from 60 feet away with enough detail to make a copy.  Adding a magnetic component (as opposed to an electronic component that doesn&#39;t work when the power is out) might be a neat way to go.<br><br>What is the ultimate resolution?  It seems the finer the resolution the less you would have to move two circles to go from &#39;unlocked&#39; to &#39;really locked&#39;.<br><br>I had an idea for a puzzle a few years back- it was simple geometric shapes.  Using a mix of diamagnetic, ferrous, and paramagnetic &#39;locks&#39; put on the corners the idea was the shape would look easier to put back together but actually require you to line up the correct north/south/diamagnetic/ferrous latches to get it.  I was running into problems with not having enough possible combinations.  The ultimate goal was to have triangles that could interlock into a few different puzzles, (so sort of in the Rubik&#39;s Cube, Snake, Magic Triangle genre) but with tradable pieces.  That was going to be the gimmick- the triangles would have cool pictures on them and you could swap them with friends to customize your puzzle.<br><br>(It wasn&#39;t so much a serious idea to take to market as an idea to see if I could solve it so I wouldn&#39;t be bored for a few days.)  Still, it could work.  There were a couple old card games, the one I remember is Don&#39;t Break the Pipes, where you laid out a network of pipes to run water from one place to another.  The pipes were cards in your hand and brass wouldn&#39;t leak.  You could put a leak on your opponents network and they couldn&#39;t advance until they had the right card to patch it (or a wrench?).

They heat the material (maybe with a laser), and while the material is close to its curie point they apply a magnetic field to the heated area, and allow it to cool. This imprints the magnetic field on the material. Once the material is cool again, the coercivity is high, and they can print neighbor regions then. The areas that are not hot enough are resistant to magnetic field changes and won&#39;t be affected by the &quot;writing&quot; of neighbor regions.\u00a0 That&#39;s my best guess.

Thanks for the video!<br><br>The first thing I thought of as a use for these magnets is more efficient motors.  This would of course depend on if there is a long or short life span for these printed magnets.  I was thinking if you could print the fields close enough with the field opposite the charged field being larger and the matched fields being smaller. Tests would need to be made of course but  depending on the strength of the magnet field I am thinking the energy used to overcome the resistance of the opposite fields would be less then the amount needed to create the kinetic energy that would be created by the natural fields. Perhaps enabling low power motors that could still produce the same power as a more power hungry motor of standard design.

That could explain the sudden change in the nature of force. As soon as the magnets come closer, the domains realign to repel each other...(which is so cool!)<br><br>Secondly, how are they <b>*CREATE*</b> poles? The head engineer at Poly-magnets specifically used this word. We all know that magnetic monopoles don&#39;t exist, then how do they create them?

What I think is so special about magnets is that they can produce force, that can majorly effect objects, without any other input of outside energy or commands. This means they can continuously produce energy efficiently, without adding fuel. I think magnets could have huge applications in energy production and also the medical field as you stated. If you could produce strong enough magnets it could make really efficient generators or electric engines. For the medical field, I think these magnets could help remove metal pieces from patients or move nano bugs through the body?

These guys are taking the neodymium discs prior to their being magnetized, and somehow their machine must be able to focus an incredibly narrow magnetic field onto the surface to achieve magnetization of only the selected &#39;maxel&#39; area? The precision alone is incredible. I would love to see the internals of the field generator. I wonder if they are not careful in the patterns they choose if the magnets can be given massive internal stresses that make them want to break themselves apart. Another thing: I had always assumed that the polarity of a magnet really doesn&#39;t play much of a role in how strongly it attracts ferromagnetic materials, but I now see I&#39;ve been looking at it narrow mindedly as with these magnets the polarity can manipulate the intensity of the field itself over a given distance. Shoot, you show magnets at <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IANBoybVApQ&amp;t=5m00s\">5:00</a> that have had their fields manipulated for a tight reach, I wonder if the opposite is possible? A pattern of magnetization that causes multiple fields to converge at a specific point in space that is above the magnet&#39;s surface, like the focal point of a parabola? I would just love to play around with a few of these magnets and see how diamagnetic materials react to the tight reaching fields. My curiosity has been piqued.
