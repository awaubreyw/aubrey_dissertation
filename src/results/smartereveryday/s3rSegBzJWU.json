Local clay. Outside walls were about 80cm thick. Looking from inside the first surface was lime mortar about 1cm thick. Then about 30cm of clay. In the middle of the wall there was about 5cm thick layer of reed (probably for thermal isolation - Polish winters are rather harsh). Then about 40cm of clay. Then reed mats. And the last (outside) layer was made from lime and sand mortar. I was amazed why this mud house did not just melted away during heavy autumn rain.\u00a0 But it lasted for about 150 years! --- Old villagers told me that there is nothing to be amazed about.
