I know life has its curveballs to bring you down from time to time, but with your attitude and your family behind you you can conquer the world Being the man you are. I would honestly vote for you if you ran for president you are just a man you are.

Mostly the Monarch got my attention and luckily, in Nebraska we had many milkweed plants they loved to eat. I also liked the pods the milkweed would produce. So, one day I decided to get a caterpillar of my own to keep in the house so I could see this process up close. I fed him until he went to pupa stage and then waited, and waited. Every day I watched for changes and even got my older sister in on the observations as I just couldn&#39;t sit still all day. So, one day I put her on watch and went exploring along the country road to see what I could find. Just a few minutes into my walk and my sister comes running down the road telling me it&#39;s happening and I need to come back to see. I got back just as the butterfly had finished emerging from the pupa and watched as it&#39;s wings slowly got bigger and bigger and hardened. Then I released him. Fly away butterfly, fly away to Mexico! I really hoped he made it.
