It does not make sense to isolate one particular item we can all agree on from others which are much more polarizing if they care co-dependent when it comes to achieving the stated goal.<br><br>From the video: &quot;A goal without a plan is just a wish.&quot;<br><br>The issue I have with the take in this video is it seems to be promoting just that: a goal without a comprehensive plan.  Here is what I mean by that.<br><br>We can throw $500 million at k-12 schools for STEM programming.  First thing of note, at the scale of federal politics in the United States $500,000 is a drop in the bucket.  Sure that&#39;s a lot of money for any one individual, but if we split that among the population of 130,930 K-12 schools in the country you end up with about $3,818 per school or roughly $10 per student.  Is that really going to be enough to make a difference?  Is it better than nothing?  Yes.  Is it enough?  Not even close.<br><br>So a major part of the story has to be about the plan.  Just throwing money at an issue we all agree needs to be addressed is not enough.  How are the funds going to be allocated is one big issue that needs to be addressed.  Also some of the more polarizing issues are the ones that some people think will have a bigger impact on the common goal described in this video.  Issues like child poverty, access to healthcare, access to technology and the internet at home.  There is no point in hiring STEM focused instruction, if the students are too hungry to be able to learn effectively, or if they cannot afford a computer at home because they require life saving insulin that prevents them from having any &quot;disposable&quot; income for these things.  These issues are inseparably related and one has to wonder if say, using that $500 million to reduce child poverty might actually have a bigger impact on the goal than enhancing STEM programming at the K-12 level.  What is likely the answer is in order to have the biggest impact we probably need to address both issues, a comprehensive plan that takes more than just one aspect of the problem into account.<br><br>In order to address the issue and achieve the goal we need to understand why we have a shortage of computer scientists and why they still seem to mostly be white men.  According to the video, the reason is there is not enough focus on computer science at the K-12 level.  That may indeed be a factor, but is it the only one, or even the primary driver to achieve the desired outcome?  The question becomes, where and how do we allocate those funds in a manner that is equitable while also providing the largest impact towards achieving the goal.<br><br>So that&#39;s the problem.  Our plan as laid out in this video seems to be, &quot;let&#39;s just throw money at the problem&quot; and fails to take a comprehensive look at the factors leading to why there is a shortage of computer scientists as well as a lack of diversity among them.  I suspect that giving that same $500 million to address some of those more polarizing issues like child poverty and healthcare  could very well have a much larger impact overall on the stated goal, than just giving an average of $3,818 per school towards the more computer science programming in K-12.", "comment_date": "2022-04-17T17:17:47Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "skuzlebut82", "comment_text": "You&#39;re listening to people that have a college education but ignoring those with important trade skills.<br><br>You should speak with Mike Rowe to bridge the gap.<br><br>High schools teaching computers, okay, high schools are also eliminating shop class.", "comment_date": "2022-03-22T05:34:45Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "danialphaomega", "comment_text": "I am late but this is soo great!<br>We as a country NEED to catch-up with all the Asian countries, as a minority this just fills me with hope that we will come as one nation and tackle the real problems that are wreaking our Great country apart.", "comment_date": "2022-03-07T19:02:32Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "gatekeeper riley", "comment_text": "One day ur gonna have to play politics ive seen the video of u an obama shithead.

Science and the well-being of people and their freedom.  If stuff like NASA and other organisations furthering scientific understanding and making life better for everybody and just generally advancing and improving our workd received the ammount of funding we throw towards stuff like developing new more destructive weapons and war, or even just a small fraction of that funding, our world would be a much more advanced, safe, enjoyable and overall better world for people to live in.    I mean, if the U.S gave NASA even 25% of the money we put towards our &quot;defense&quot; budget, we would probably have had peopke living on the moon 20 years ago, and woukd possibly be in the process of doing the same on mars.    Imagine a world where trips to the moon for scientists were as common place as trips to Antarctica are now for scientists, with groups coming and going from the moon regularly.   But sadly weve used those resources infesting the planet with thousands of nukes, developing insane methods for killing our fellow men and women through drones and such from the other side of the planet.  And ever more depressing is that this problem just seems to be getting worse.   The fact that most of the technology we enjoy today was developed for war really says a lot about the state of our species. It really is incredibly sad and disappointing that the force pushing science and technology forward has almost always been war in one way or another.    Our weaponry has started to evolve so much faster than our sense of morality that it becomes more likely each day that we are going to end up starting a war none will survive, but that most would support in one way or another.    We have an endless potential to master the universe around us and mold it, along with ourselves, into something better and better, but this potential of ours is squandered on developing easier eays to kill and destroy our world and all who call it home.  And when we aren&#39;t directly destroying people and places intentionally, we are carelessly polluting it and making it an ever more toxic environment for life.    The tipping point is rapidly approaching, and the closer we get to that point of no return the easier it gets to cross it.      These are intense times, hopefully in 200 years there will stilk be people around to look back to this time in history and learn from the horrible mistakes weve made developing our world.

I think it&#39;s great that people are trying to get programs into schools. But here&#39;s the thing: coding isn&#39;t just about a language, but rather the critical thinking behind it. I&#39;ve learned parts of multiple languages over my 5 years of programming, but the best part is taking an issue and finding the solution. That&#39;s just science! As noble of a cause this is, I feel it might just sort of fall apart. I personally love learning, and at this point learn by reading stuff like the Mozilla Documentation and doing projects. It&#39;s like sitting with a bunch of physics formulas and doing experiments, and I absolutely love it. Kids in my school though, they could care less. One kid argued with a teacher about being late to class because his bag was there even though he wasn&#39;t. Sure, getting these classes will help kids learn, but kids need to want to learn. I live in a rural town, and I make jokes about our school being poor, but in reality it&#39;s not funny. We can&#39;t afford to have enough teachers to do classes, and one teacher left partly from being overworked. There&#39;s no discipline because parents don&#39;t do it at home and complain because the school is doing it for them. When teachers are out, multiple classes at a time are put under one substitute who basically babysits all of them. School is a place for me to want to learn, but I&#39;m a rare breed called an honors student (which is a fancy code word for how students really should be). I feel the public education system doesn&#39;t work well (at least my school), and I wish more kids would love learning as much as I do. I binge watch channels like Smarter Every Day, Minute Physics, Vsause, 3Blue1Brown, and other channels like these just because I love learning.<br><br>Either way, computer science has been awesome for me, and everything I learned was really from me teaching myself, not something my school offered.

If I was a principal or someone in control of a school I would include computer science as one of the major subjects. It would have done a lot to improve my personal experience with school and I believe it would help many kids get a more balanced education. A lot of people are not great at doing math expecially without a calculator and the likely reason is that they are not shown what mathematics can do for them later in life and why math is important to know. So many times I was told sometimes by the math teacher that what was being taught is not likely to ever get used again as an adult, so why would I or anyone who is told that or thinks that ever focus on learning about the solution to a problem that won&#39;t show up ever again outside the classroom? A computer science class would solve that lack of applied usefulness of the subject, which would do a lot to get kids to focus more on learning the subject since it is no longer a useless subject you have to take to get a diploma. It would also bridge interest between math, science and writing  and help demonstrate application for the information being taught. So beound computer science being a useful subject that everyone could use on a daily basis to improve and make efficiencies in their lives if they knew how to code but it would improve interest in most of the other subjects as well.", "comment_date": "2019-02-18T15:24:11Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Joao Rocha", "comment_text": "Maybe Trump Foundation may help too.

I have no clue if you will read this or not and I hope and seriously am praying that you do not take offense at what I am typing here... because I genuinly hope it can be proven that at least 60% or even close to 80% of what was raised goes where they claim... statistically it doesn&#39;t and won&#39;t and I HATE to see a positive message like the one your video be realized with what has developed as a biproduct of laws that allow the unsuccessful charities to operate with that 20%-towards-stated-cause law. Again I hope I am wrong... , I ONLY state this with concern and best-intentions of all in mind, wishing that the action behind so many messages like the ones in your video represent. I love what you are and what you represent... and if I am wrong (again I hope I am... I PRAY I AM)... and just am speaking from what I have seen and personal experience in my life... I hate the thought of your publicity being used as part of the whole &quot;wagging the dog&quot; issues/problems/greed/corruptness that is heavy within the whole charity/fundraising/venture capital raising thru publicly stated Non-profits/programs/corporations with profit as their hidden and very contrary to what is spoken as their goals.  I have no problems so long as the 500 million is super TRANSPARENT on EXACTLY HOW IT IS ALL SPENT... like the Microsoft lady said there needs to be a goal. Bill and Melinda Gates foundation never has a problem showing how everything is spent because they were founded as a result of a desire to fight this public fraud (my high-functioning-autistic brain&#39;s lack of a better term escaping me so yes... fraud... at least hypocrisy). Ask them how it is EXACTLY going to be spent... because they can be real vague during the podium dances where they focus on where we all want things to be in the future... ASK... where the accountability lies that it is not legally squandered in that 80% legal charity/fundraising loophole... as has been the case so many <b>*colorful metaphor*</b> times and again... I hope I am wrong... and hopefully what you and I both hope for is closer as I hope my kids take up computer science as they get old enough to talk and type.  Stepping off my soapbox... agape... storge... filia... Love for each other and our children&#39;s future should conquer the greedy-selfish-plotting-bad-people&#39;s love of money, but so rarely does.  -1John4:1", "comment_date": "2017-11-04T04:11:28Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Cyclonic", "comment_text": "I&#39;d take Ivanka for president far more than her dad", "comment_date": "2017-11-04T03:29:09Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Judge Gently", "comment_text": "So, the program and money are for females and minorities only?

I know coding.<br><br>While I wish I had had CS in K12 school (we didn&#39;t have computers in my high school until the year after I graduated), I have learned through the school of hard knocks that pure CS is next to useless without a strong basic education in all other disciplines: math, physics, english, history, social studies, chemistry, engineering, even personal finance and physical education. Why? Because APPLYING CS is just as important as CS itself. Great, teach kids how to code, but if they can&#39;t pass the rest, they won&#39;t know how to APPLY that knowledge.<br><br>I know LOTS of coders; some of them are really sharp people, but if you spend more time teaching them things they should have learned in K12 than it takes to get a job done, that knowledge really doesn&#39;t mean much. So, yeah, while it is great that we&#39;re spending a paltry $500M on one tiny area of vocational knowledge, let&#39;s spend the rest of the billions necessary to get them just as competent in the core knowledge and skill areas they will need to make that one tiny area actually useful.<br><br>I&#39;ll also point out that low-end programming jobs don&#39;t pay a whole lot more than subsistence-level wages, and a glut of low-end programmers coming out of high school won&#39;t improve that figure; more than likely will lower it, which is a possible motivation for these big companies to put forward this kind of money, because they will make it back from lower human resources costs; ie, lower wages across the board.<br><br>Yes, that sounds dark, but that&#39;s capitalism in a nutshell; corporations&#39; SOLE goal is to maximize profits. Creating a glut of CS lowers wages across the board. Now, maybe some people are ok with that. In many years in business, I have received not an insignificant amount of pushback on the cost of IT - people complaining about having to pay more, despite prices being on the low side of the market averages for services. However, the only way those prices can go down in a so-called &quot;free market&quot; is if you can pay the people doing the work less. Profits aren&#39;t going to go down just because people want lower prices.<br><br>All that aside, I think this is a good start, despite my misgivings as to the motivations of the government and corporate backers. Now, we just need to get this kind of energy behind the rest of our educational system and core subjects as well. It won&#39;t be anywhere as cheap as this, but it is ultimately a Good Thing, too.<br><br>I think John Green said it best: <br><br>\u201cPublic education does not exist for the benefit of students or the benefit of their parents.

Every second of every day of your life, you benefit from public education.<br><br>So let me explain why I like to pay taxes for schools, even though I don&#39;t personally have a kid in school: It&#39;s because I don&#39;t like living in a country with a bunch of stupid people.\u201d", "comment_date": "2017-10-31T22:08:44Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "AlphaArcticWolf", "comment_text": "Constantly pointing out racial/ gender inequality is both racist and sexist.

Like how we had to properly learn to read and write in MIPS (the assembly language) for just <i>one class</i> -- the class that already wanted you to learn how basic processors compute information, how to do various calculations on binary numbers by hand, how to convert MIPS instructions to and from binary data (again, <i>by hand</i> ), etc... Haven&#39;t had to write a single line of MIPS since.<br>Also pretty fun taking required math classes like Calculus 2 which are designed with <i>no calculators in mind.</i> I get that students need to understand derivatives and integrals before they just plug them into calculators, but when over half of Calculus 1 and Calculus 2 is just about simplifying them by hand -- <i>when we&#39;re computer science students</i> -- it gets really demotivating.<br>And besides the main classes just being badly taught, they also mostly bias to teaching how <i>hardware</i> works. Which isn&#39;t necessarily a bad thing, but it&#39;s something to take note of if you ever want to study anything about computers. &quot;Computer science&quot; is a super-broad name, and honestly, I wish I had realized that sooner -- understanding and programming for an operating system is a whole different world than programming in a high-level language (as you would for most occupations).

Honestly, I think the shortage of skilled blue collar workers is a larger problem in this country in the longrun.  Our decades old mantra that everyone should get a college degree has proven to encourage many who dont have the passion or aptitude for a degree driven career to pursue one anyway, which has just left them jobless or unhappy in a career with a large college debt.  Those same people may have been perfectly happy and successful as a plumber, electrician, welder, construction worker, etc.  I agree we should educate kids as best we can, and expose them to as many different lines of work as possible, but we need to be careful when we encourage people to take careers because of a shortage of a talent in society rather than for them to take a job that they are passionate about.    You are right that the mission to Mars will have millions of lines of code on it, but that ship that they are on will also have to be built by real people with real physical skills.

It&#39;s something people should know about, but school won&#39;t teach you anything useful. Even at my University, my &quot;programming teachers&quot; all said that their job was not to teach us knowledge, but how to teach ourselves. Tech moves fast. In 2-3 years, half of your knowledge will be useless, and it&#39;s getting worse as tech moves faster and faster. Knowledge is a wasteful goal. Understanding is the only thing useful. <br><br>Most of the best books on &quot;programming&quot; are back from the 60s and 70s. Nearly (not all) every problem you see in tech, software wise, was solved 60 years ago. What you see is programmers struggling to understand the issues they are presented in an ever so slightly different way and re-inventing the wheel because they don&#39;t have the basic understanding to apply the solutions made decades ago.<br><br>Programming is an interesting problem domain. Many people make analogies to programming like building a house. Yes, some of programming is knowing about your tools and materials. But what&#39;s really awesome about programming is every programmer can not only make their own tools, but their own materials. It&#39;s like making your own universe with it&#39;s own custom rules, governed only by logic. You can make a material denser than a neutron star or stronger than graphene, or super conductive at any temperature, maybe your universe has many more than 3 spatial dimensions. Then you build a house using those materials in that maybe 12 spatial dimensional universe.<br><br>Using this analogy, it would be like becoming a surgeon, where you not only fix biological beings, but you designed the biological beings using your own rules for biology. How could anyone teach you anything about surgery on an organism that has never been seen before and in a universe with completely different rules for biology? You can&#39;t. But you can teach someone how to think like a surgeon. That is what programming is all about.<br><br>Here in lies the rub. How do you teach someone to think? You can&#39;t, they must learn for themselves from themselves. You can only expose them to situations that allow them to have to think in novel ways.

I retired 8 years ago after 43 years in Information Technology. When I started working in the industry in 1968 there was no body of knowledge in IT to study.  If you could pass an aptitude test you were in.  There were not many jobs available I think there were 3, yes 3, in my home town.  You basically sank or swam on your innate ability to reason.  Fortunately I swam, doing every type of work in the IT field, Programming, starting with IBM Assembler, the Cobol until finally I had programmed in 11 languages.  It is true that if you can program, and some people cannot, it is actually an easy job, it is designing and building systems that is hard (Systems Analysis and Design and Project Leadership), and before I acquired the tools to do it nearly broke me. Fortunately that system went in smoothly and I  emigrated from the UK to work for Ford Australia. As time went on I owned a small Consultancy company with 2 friends. I did some good work for 16 years, the first consultancy project I worked on, a 2 year project,  ran for for 39 years before the client re developed it. Others ran for 20 years and, I was pleased to discover could not process the work load as fast as mine. That has to be up there for longevity!<br><br>Eventually my technology platform was becoming obsolescent and I moved into &#39;management&#39; with a State Government Department.  After years of controlling my own destiny I did not enjoy middle management but resigned from Government Service as Enterprise Architecture Manager. Sounds great doesn&#39;t it? It wasn&#39;t!<br><br>However after a career programming, the easy stuff, and deriving User Requirements (The most important step) and then designing and documenting systems, it became apparent that the world had changed and there were fewer and fewer customers for Custom Systems and more and more &#39;Standard Systems&#39; for sale. Customer management was becoming more and more gun shy of Custom System and would prefer to buy a package because, cynical me, they wanted to out source the responsibility for success, or rather failure of system development. The major problem with this approach is that they NEVER DEFINED THEIR REQUIREMENTS before buying a &#39;solution.<br><br>Here is the main point of my post.  The one thing technical area, in my opinion, that will never become obsolete is Computer Security Management, not system development.  My son, now in his 40&#39;s trained as a Systems Developer, but has worked on Computer Security ever since he started work in IT.  He is very good at it and has global responsibility for thousands of computers in an International company.  He now earns twice what I earned as an employee when I retired. As a company owner I rarely earned what he does today.<br><br>So, in my opinion the best fields to enter are not coding but Business Analysis and Computer security.<br><br>I hope you find that advice useful.

Discriminating does not stop discrimination, it only provokes it. In the comp sci field we need a smaller group of people who enjoy what they do rather than a large group of people who hate what they do because we need people who understand things at a deep level. Programming is not a follow instruction type of job, it requires you to think abstractly and be able to problem solve. Programming is more of an art than a science (but it isn&#39;t either, it is in a group all on its own) and you can&#39;t teach the thought process that you need to be decent at programming.

There is a good reason that with all the availability of resources and sources in US, the &quot;greatest country in the world&quot; is so far behind in education. There has to be a balance between smart people and not smart people for the system to work to allow the money funneling for the owners. Giving or allocating $50 or $500 million to CS is not good as just a title. It all depends on what and how is this funding spent on. Most of the educational institutes in US are nothing more than revenue generation systems. They are not teaching much of real skills and knowledge or promote much in value of thinking, other than memorizing nonsense to pass multiple choices. When I was there, I saw the school systems in 5 states and different counties because of my work and it seemed with all the possible tools, most students have little ability to do simple arithmetics, balance a checkbook, do minimum independent life instances but great in cutting color paper and gluing it together with glitter or dissect a frog. The text books are big and heavy full of pictures printed in 4 colors so they can be sold for huge profits. Teaching CS would be a good thing if it was not geared for another money making scam.

However I can honestly say that I don&#39;t think that anybody that disagrees with me is a bad person we just have a difference in opinion.

The reason why 500 million dollars is specifically going to computer science is because there is a high demand for individuals to go into computer science but they aren&#39;t, so they&#39;re trying to provide an environment in which kids can have the opportunity to learn computer science. i.e funding computer science programs in schools (This is the point of the entire video I do not know how you missed it)<br><br>&quot;Also, I don&#39;t think race and gender should be qualifiers in grants or scholarships etc. It is absolutely ludicrous.<br>There are Black people from rich homes and White people from absolute garbage.

There is is an unrepresentative amount of women and minorities in computer science, so if you&#39;re not a race realist or think women belong in the home, it doesn&#39;t make sense why there is an unrepresentative amount of women and minorities in the field in a free market society abstracted from culture. Lets say in a perfect world there was equal opportunity to everyone, there will still probably be an unrepresentative backgrounds in certain fields i.e women and construction, but this is not true in the case of computer science, since primarily the problems that women and minorities deal with are stigma and lack of opportunity. So if you want to rectify this problem in computer science, which again is the point of this video, you put towards grants/scholarships to rectify it. Now this is the case in terms of grants and scholarships, in terms of education programs, where the money primarily was hinted to go towards, no one is gonna say this program is only for blacks or just for women in schools, you&#39;re delusional if you believe that.

Instead, people with Indian or Asian heritage, nearly evenly split between men and women, make up the majority of the IT workforce (often overwhelmingly).  Our schools aren&#39;t producing enough graduates with the right skills, either because kids aren&#39;t interested or due to lack of funding.  This leaves employers little choice but to hire from abroad (H1B) or offshore some or all of the work, which despite regulations and expenses still costs less and provides a more sufficient supply.<br>If you look at school demographics, you&#39;ll find that same mix represents the top scorers and the most likely to continue into college and advanced degrees.  The typical definition of &quot;minorities&quot; refers to Blacks and Hispanics, who also tend to be at the bottom end of the spectrum both in school achievement and the IT workplace.  As another commenter noted, Asian (and Indian) kids hate school just as much as anyone else, but their parents &quot;get it&quot; and try to turn their kids into high achievers whether they want to or not.  The degree of parental involvement seems to have the most direct correlation with academic achievement, far more so than any racial, ethnic, or financial influence.<br>The &quot;white privilege&quot; no one defines properly is the result of valuing individual achievement and the responsibility and hard work that it takes to earn what you have, even if you might be better off in the short term giving the system responsibility for your needs and choices without regard for who ultimately pays the price.<br>So this program appears to be like many others attempting to equalize for those that don&#39;t have as much &quot;white privilege&quot; (above definition, not the common version which is racist in nature), and helps provide for the future so that we don&#39;t have to go abroad as much to keep up with IT demand.

Get the money learn the code is great....money in the school is great if it is being used to help kids that may not have the funds to enter the com sci field. What I love for you destin to explain to me is how do you equalize the gender gap? If it&#39;s more males applying for the education it&#39;s always going to be lop sided? Now this is going to sound bad but I ask it in order to have it explained. Do we turn away the more qualified  in order to ballance the gender (no I am not saying men are more qualified just that if the ballance is so lop sided the chances are there are more qualified from the larger side)! If you have a group of 100 of the top students (the best of the best) an you only have 20 positions to fill, of the 100 there is 80% group A and 20% group B. One fifth of each group is in the top percentile. That means four from the Bs and fourteen from the As. Of the 100 do we take these 20 to fill the positions? If we do that&#39;s not going to ballance the scales and if we don&#39;t take the 20 then we are not taking the best of the best! I don&#39;t care who or what you are, male/female, Caucasian/non Caucasian I just want the best doing the job. So to summarize if the top are not the ones we want to bring in would it not be discriminatory to take the less qualified over the  more qualified?

Let&#39;s be honest, giant tech companies don&#39;t care about women in the workplace (or for anyone, for that matter). They only care about their bottom line. The more people (women) that go into CS, the more competition for positions, which means lower wages. It&#39;s no coincidence that the charity these conglomerates chose to give to is one that that&#39;ll benefit them (albeit indirectly). The PR is just a bonus.<br><br>Furthermore, why is it so important for women to go into CS anyway? Women and men traditionally tend to go in different fields. Women go more into fields that are more geared towards human interaction (Health, Education, Social Work) whereas men tend to go for more technical fields (Comp. Sci, Engineering). I don&#39;t see anyone up in arms about there not being enough men in nursing/human resources/childcare, or women in mining/waste disposal/construction. And even within their chosen professions, women tend to go for positions that they&#39;ll find more enjoyable, whereas men are more likely to go for positions that&#39;ll pay more. For example, in Medicine, women make up 56% of pediatricians, and only 16% of cardiologists. What makes computer science so special?<br><br>And how is this going to work, anyway? Through grants?

Now some may say the education is quite different from America but with experience and interaction the Americans that transferred in, the tech side is quite similar. I am currently 18 years old and on a path to a business degree, but ever since I was a kid had a strong interest in computer science. When I was 7 I was given my first computer, every couple years after that rebuilding it with help from my dad and learning the basics and fundamentals of code. In school I was rewarded with numerus technology and robotics awards. In school there was nothing but discouragement for me to go into computer science. Let\u2019s start with the high school computer science classes, grade 9 I was graded with a 68%, why? If you were to progress ahead of the class, you would be docked marks. You would also be docked marks if people were to come over and ask you questions, and if they were to ask the teacher the questions he wouldn\u2019t know how to answer. Grade 10, 11, and 12 were very similar, the teacher actually had no idea what he was doing. We had a beautiful brand new computer science lab with its own network separate from the schools, and brand new computers. The teacher made us go through code academy at our own speed the entire semester, most of us finished within a couple weeks, so we found out the admin logins and made a class wide Minecraft server to serve us the rest of the semester. The teacher didn\u2019t teach one lesson. At the end of the semester we were given an exam, 40 out of the 100 marks were a crossword, not just any crossword, a crossword from the 90\u2019s. One of the fill-ins for the crossword no joke was \u201cWhat is a popular internet browser?\u201d The answer was Netscape Navigator. Luckily it was only worth 40% of what we could assume was our total grade. Grades 11 and 12 didn\u2019t have an exam, but all we did was code academy. When it came time to apply for schools I talked to the councilors at the school about computer science and all they did was encourage me to take more general pathways. Now I did have encouragement from the teachers of the clubs I was on, and there were teachers from other schools that helped a lot. The thing is sometimes people aren\u2019t given the right positions in the school or there just aren\u2019t enough teachers that know code to teach it. I don\u2019t know what the solution is, funding is good but it only gets you so far.

The appropriate clever quote here is &quot;War is the failure of politics&quot;.<br><br>I taught myself programming back in the early 80&#39;s on a second hand apple plugged into a TV using the RF converter of a video recorder and a cassette recorder for storage. I learnt via hobby magazines and books borrowed from the library. Friends started telling me I could make good money from coding and I enrolled in university. I graduated with a Bsc in computer science as a mature age student in &#39;91,  it gave me the gift of scientific literacy and liberated myself and my young family from the &quot;working poor&quot;. The only reason I could afford to go to university was the &quot;socialist&quot; education system we have here in Australia. <br><br>There were 160 students who started the same course with me, only 3 were female. Four years later only 12 of the original students graduated with me, all 3 women and all 4 mature age students were in that group of 12. The lack of women in the software industry is puzzling and there are many theories as to why women tend to avoid the field, none of which I find very convincing. If you go back to the 50&#39;s and 60&#39;s there were actually more female programmers than male, the first programmer back in the 1800&#39;s was Ada Lovelace, etc, etc... your sister can probably tell you more about the proud history of women in software than I can in a YT comment.  <br><br>For anyone of any age or gender who can read and wants to learn coding the internet is a fantastic resource, I would have crawled over broken glass to have had such a resource back in the 80&#39;s. However to get your foot in the door as a professional software dev you will need more than just coding skills, you need a (lot of luck or) a  BSc, preferably in CS, math or engineering.

More men tend to go into maths, engineering and computer science than women. A lot more actually. Most men are &quot;wired&quot; to work with objects and abstractions while women are better at working with people. This expaines why nursing and teaching positions are dominated by women and the opposite is true for the fields previously mentioned. For example, according to the Association of American Educators, males constitute &quot;...2.3% of pre-K and kindergarten teachers, 18.3% of the elementary and middle school teacher population, and 42% of the high school level teaching staff.&quot; This makes sense right? Does it mean that we have to pump $500 million dollars into fixing this &quot;problem&quot;? Does this mean that when two, equally qualified people (male and female) go into an interview for a teaching position at a elementary school, the male has an advantage because there are far fewer males teachers? That would be absurd right!? Both sexes have the same chance of getting the job but there are obviously more women applying for that teaching position. Same is true for tech field jobs like computer science which are dominated by men for a reason; more men like and choose computer science as a career path.
