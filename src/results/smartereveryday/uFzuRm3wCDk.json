But I have to call him out on saying it requires a computer to walk a boat sidewise.<br><br>  I&#39;m a 20-year retired navy veteran, And among many other things I was tasked with in my career,  Was in the 1980s, I worked at an oil recovery unit at 32st Naval Station in San Diego for three years. I am very proud that I was able to accomplish certification as a coxswains mate (which wasn&#39;t even part of my rating, I was a machinist mate) And after certification I was given my own work boat and crew. We (The unit) were tasked with cleaning up oil spills in the bay, AND, we recovered over a million gallons of spilled oil in the bay, each and every year !!<br><br> We had many different types of boats, The most important being the skimmer boat that removed the oil from the surface of the water. But our main work horse was a 40-foot utility boat, what most people would identify, (via the movies) as the boat used to land troops on the beach in a land invasion, (minus the front drop gate). <br><br>A big diesel powered air compressor was up on the deck on the bow above the cargo area, which was filled up with large, air powered diaphragm pumps and waste oil tanks. Anyway, for propulsion it had two diesel engines and a simple steering wheel, my point is, that by turning the wheel in the correct direction, and directing one engine forward and one engine in reverse we were able to &quot;walk&quot; the boat sidewise, all without the use of a computer. it was all about the ability of the coxswain, it didn&#39;t require a computer. <br><br> Over and above that, I&#39;m not trying to cast any aspersions on the people involved with this channel. I think this website is by and far an outstanding example of what social media should be and I applaud everything they do. Keep up the good work guys, and girls, (if there are any.)

Rather than the tried and tested method of using lawn mowers and strimmers etc. After the experiment perhaps you could see what would happen to a ballistic dummy&#39;s head and body. \ud83e\udd14\ud83d\ude31", "comment_date": "2022-05-12T23:31:28Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Leonardo Reyes", "comment_text": "Yeah!

Very cool video. But you should check out the volvo penta joystick system or the mercury one. As an added bonus they cand direct thrust independently not just in parallel as this boat does. They can use outboards, inboards and sometimes they also integrate bow thrusters and even stern thrusters to obtain &quot;super-positioning&quot;. It would be cool if you could dedicate another clip for these systems. They also have functions like &quot;skyhook&quot; - keep the boat rock steady without any human intervention or now they are developing a system that parks the boat by itself.

The RB-M drive is similar to the Volvo Penta IPS, which uses multiple, counterrotating screws, that can be aimed independently, unlike the RB-M. The IPS allows for some amazing tricks, too. Imagine going down into the engine room with extremely hot and noisy engines spinning inches from you in a rough sea - now that\u2019s fun. Bringing a good-sized boat with twin screws into a berth or leaving - and doing it gracefully - is just so cool.

I had always owned outboard motor boats for freshwater fishing, but I bought a jet boat at one point.  There are some things that I found more inconvenient than an outboard though.  When the grating over the impeller intake gets clogged with seaweed / aquatic vegetation, you often cannot clear it without diving under the boat.  Even worse is if a rope gets sucked into the impeller intake and wrapped around the impeller shaft.  This is not as quick to fix because it has made it past the grating and you need to spend a lot more time removing the grating (with tools and hoping that you don&#39;t drop the screws / bolts in the process).  You really need a SCUBA rig to do this since it takes long enough that you will not be holding your breath to do it.  It&#39;s one thing to do this when in the calm waters tied up to a dock in a harbor, but it&#39;s quite another thing to do it when you are a few miles offshore even if the seas are only 2-3 ft...

To get the performance for river operations it had a flat bottom the rear third with twin vertical fins on both sides for stability and to steer against. This not a new design. They used jet boats in Vietnam. They were only about 20 feet long but had a lot of weapons on them. Since I had zero experience with boats I had to use my imagination.

They want us controlled by the meter which means the white world has to use conventional tech while they keep the better stuff hidden decade after decade after decade after decade, you get the point. It\u2019s existed for many years and it\u2019s ridiculous that this boat even got made, we should have hovering craft that don\u2019t have to deal with the impact from waves, wind, or anything with how the electromagnetic bubble around the craft repels everything, since EVERYTHING has a magnetic field attraction of some strength or another. If we could give this black world classified tech to EVERYONE including the coast guard here and the free people rescue efforts would change DRAMATICALLY. The lives saved would be tenfold, they\u2019d go from operating with jet boats and helicopters thinking they\u2019re advanced tech (when they\u2019re about as antiquated as you can get by proper comparison to \u201canti gravitic\u201d craft) to then using these craft of which we have a massive fleet of and older models that could AND SHOULD be phased in to the coast guard and other white world military units. Our special forces should also d*mn sure be given the best of the best when they actually aren\u2019t cause then there\u2019s the VERY black units that are a several generation by now version of the super soldier program and that\u2019s a whole other rabbit whole to go down. How do I know these things? Let\u2019s just say I was in the Navy and have been inside these anti gravitic craft when serving in the REAL Navy space program, I\u2019ve also been right beside, mere feet away from a silently hovering triangle shaped craft (the Tr3b) as well as the wingless and tailless anti gravity evolution of the F-117 Nighthawk that\u2019s still highly classified and is our true VERY FAST stealth \u201cfighter\u201d multi role small craft, they got drone and manned versions because of how the magneticgravitic bubble cancels out the g forces.

I highly appreciate the amount of time and effort you (and your team) put into these videos.<br><br>As I said in your previous video on the search and rescue missions I am a fan of analog systems.<br>Again, I love that there are still analog testers for such things as oil viscosity. Not because I am against electronics, or such (heck, I worked in IT most of my life).<br><br>But a) because the simplicity yet ingenuity of many of these testers fascinates me, and b) because they will work ALL the time, won&#39;t need constant calibration, energy, can&#39;t be disrupted by a storm, affected by a solar flare, or a hundred other such factors. Simple gravity and resistance due to surface area and passing volumes through a pre-gauged gap. That&#39;s it. Once it&#39;s calibrated mechanically it is fairly difficult to decalibrate. They fall in the water or sand, get dirty, you name it. No worries, clean and dry them out, and they are probably ready to go immediately. Electronics on the other hand do tend to collect condensed water over time, and in a maritime environment that chance increases a LOT. So in essence analog systems have nearly the same reasons to fail as electronic systems but can be easily restored to working order in most cases with very simple tools. Electronics, once broken, usually require replacement. <br><br>While electronics will often give results a bit quicker than analog systems, the time gains most often are only marginal, as some physical aspect has to be tested which simply requires a certain time to pass. So a time gain through electronics often is superficial, and the sturdiness of a device is of a higher value than the speed gain.<br><br>EDIT: The outro comments: Ortiz, THAT was two awesome burns in one minute.

The jet drive is indeed fast and cool, and the boat can definitely stop and reverse faster than a conventionally driven boat, BUT the handling of the boat is exactly the same on a boat with two fixed wheels (propellers) and two rudders, each aligned directly in the wheel wash. The ability to move your boat sideways through the water is called &quot;crabbing&quot; or &quot;crab walking&quot; and every captain and/or wheelman running a supply boat out to the Gulf oil platforms NEEDS to develop this skill quickly.; The primary function of a supply boat is to deliver fuel, water, personnel, materials and expendables to the oil platforms. In almost every case the platform has a crane on a deck some 100 to 150 feet above the water and the boat MUST remain fixed in the water under that crane regardless of sea conditions, current and wind direction. The off load and reload of waste products to and from the platform can take several hours to half a day to even longer and it is forbidden to tie the supply boat up to the platform&#39;s legs or to drop anchor. This play of opposing, variable thrust and using the rudders to direct the forward thrusting wheel wash to one side or another, much like a stern thruster, is a dance I did with my boat almost every day for quite a number of years. I actually learned to &quot;crab walk&quot; on a 235 foot passenger vessel (a casino boat in the Carolinas), and learned to do it without using the bow thruster. I&#39;ve also used the same technique on a tug boat pushing three 120 foot barges secured end to end.<br>I&#39;m not bragging about this, I&#39;m pointing out that this handling ability is not unique to a jet drive boat.", "comment_date": "2022-05-01T06:33:00Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "adam parsons", "comment_text": "AH..MAN, wish they didn&#39;t have drop you off!

The units were called Blakey boats. The jet boats were introduced to the Coast Guard in Akwesasne NY 13655. Our Hogansburg Akwesasne vol. fire dept. was introduced to jet boats O/A 2015 when a friend and I was doing salvage work on the St Lawrence river. We had been using my personal vessel with water rescues. Our design was modified by local \u201cexperts\u201d and refused to give us the contract to supply the adopted  fire boat. Even the \u201cexperts\u201d denied to pay my Canadian boat permit, even though I was an EMT / fire fighter with the HAVFD. I see your boat is fairly close to our design, but I am willing to teach your crews on many tricks that I see the need for. I am a former Highway Engineer and 12 year fish and game officer on the Canadian side of the St. Lawrence. Blakey Boats suppled the NYSP on the Niagara Falls falls. We trained the state police on the proper safety operation above the Falls. I am offering my services for the cost of expenses at any location you may need me to be. I am a disabled Army vet. In 1992 my friend and I were adopted us as Marines and to say Semper Fi due to a repatriation of four Marines from Canada during a Canadian Armed forces / RCMP raiding a Native territory and was met with a superior force. The superior force were 90% Army and Marine veterans. They also killed one of their own in the cross fire. You want to hear the whole story you have to buy supper. My phone (temporary) number is 315-855-1344. Address is 171 Helena road, Akwesasne NY 13655. Check with the state dept. to verify the international incident. The Marines promised to get even. Thtey did in 1992, at the World Series game. The color guard flew the Canadian flag upside down. They have always answered me when I asked for comment.

But he calls it &quot;very analog.&quot; Everyone knows what he means, and this is the term a lot of us would come up with for what he means. But it&#39;s not analog at all. It&#39;s *actual*. Analog is a readout that somehow reflects reality directly (that is an analog, an analogy of reality) without being mediated by a digital computer or any quantized stage. A dial indicator on a fuel gauge, for example. But with a device like this, there is not even that distance from the thing being measured. This is a direct measurement in a way an analog electric fuel gauge is not. This would make a great subject for further study: cool direct measurement gauges and tools.

It is fine as long as the state pays for it. At those revolutions, the engines would need good continuous supervision. The enclosed impellers are liable to cavitate and the metal erodes quite fast. There is a lot of pressure built up and the diffusers/nozzles at the back, which can act as amplifiers and accelerate the water flow after the impeller does its bit. The noise of those engines is deafening and they need soundproofing and a camera, as no human ear will ever be comfortable standing in between those engines when underway. Those crafts are like fighter aircraft and one needs to select the crew to be between twenty to twenty-five years and have a light structure and a good spine to take the pounding in higher waves but not too high, as that craft will not take it. I remember the old Air-sea WW2 rescue boats with aircraft Merlin engines and the Packard- Merlin which was made in the US and had better tolerances than the British Merlin engine.  <br>The craft shown in this video is more maneuverable than the British boats, but the latter were better for longer-distance comforts, for the more aged crew!!

They were NATO-designed &amp; built by Boeing, so at least some parts were built like aircraft.  The boats had cracking problems with the exhaust stacks (vibration caused, I think) and Boeing&#39;s lead time and cost were unacceptable to the Navy at the time.  I worked at the local Naval Air Rework Facility, and we were asked to build the replacement exhaust stacks because they were designed &amp; built like aircraft.  If I remember correctly, they used diesel-powered water jets at low speeds and turbine engines for the water jets for higher speeds.  The Navy wouldn&#39;t admit to their upper speed capability back then, but we were told that it was impressive.  I suspect that since the ships are long decommissioned, the official performance specs are now available.
