Scenario: You are driving along a road and you decide to pass a car. As you approach, you happen to glance at the wheels spinning, but for a split second you can see individual spokes before it becomes a blurred wheel again. Why is that? I have been trying to find research of my own on this and have not been able to find it, but I seem to have MAYBE understood it from watching this video. Is it because we are able to sense that particular image we just took, like a camera, for a finite amount of time?
