Some people feel that religion is an essential part of development for a child: it&#39;s believable when you read CS Lewis&#39; apologetics and in lieu of religion it&#39;s probably of benefit to dedicate some time to ethics, community, etc. We young people in the West say religion has thoroughly been disproven, and that is objectively true, but we&#39;ve only really reached this point in the last few decades.

I was raised a catholic here in Mexico and while I too was indoctrinated i was always encouraged to challenge my own toughts and the things that people told me, incluiding those of my parents, which is how i ended up being an atheist, I do not feel that i was raised badly even if I was raised a catholic and I don&#39;t think that my morality or values would be any different if I didn&#39;t became an atheist, which is why i&#39;m not as concerned as others about this, I think that you guys are good people who want to help and because you are christians believe that your religion is part of the process, as long as the attitude towards this is relaxed and kids aren&#39;t reprimended or told that evolution is wrong and the flood is somethign that happened. I see no issues even if they become part of a religion that i don&#39;t agree with, also i think there is almost nothing more capable in creating good values than being an orphan raised by people with extremely good values themselves as they will grow up to be a reflection of those good intentions.<br><br>For anyone reading this, you are free to donate to any non religious affiliated charity proyect if you don&#39;t like this one for any reason and if you are interested in the goals of this one, maybe you could even start your own secular or simply not religious affiliated proyect in Peru, I&#39;m sure that no one will stop you and the two proyects could support each other seeing that they are doing the same thing, maybe one day they will even play football soccer agaisnt each other, obviously seculars would win ;) but don&#39;t tell Destin.", "comment_date": "2015-12-17T05:29:44Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Pablo Zamora", "comment_text": "This video made me very happy, seeing how happy the children are :)", "comment_date": "2015-12-17T05:17:24Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "J D", "comment_text": "Hey Destin, can you do a video on the Krakatoa explosion (water heated in a sealed glass test tube) in slow motion?

I can&#39;t wait to support it financially once I&#39;m out of grad school.  I wanted to mention one thing about the arapaima...they can be dangerous.  They are great for food, but picking them up like that can lead to incredible injuries.  Arapaima are incredibly strong, as I&#39;m sure you can attest to, and a full-sized one (that one was nowhere close) could crack ribs or worse if it &quot;kicked.&quot;  So be careful, and the kids had it right when they ran.
