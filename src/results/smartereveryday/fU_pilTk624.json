[{"comment_by": "SmarterEveryDay", "comment_text": "This is the first video in a series about the US Coast Guard.  Here in the US we just kind of know that the Coast Guard always has our back, but we don&#39;t really think about how they do what they do.  I wanted to get a better understanding for what goes into saving lives, so I&#39;m excited to share this, the first video in a whole series on the Coast Guard. So far I&#39;ve filmed in Mobile AL, Destin FL, and New Orleans LA.  Imagine waking up every day and figuring out how to save people.  Incredibly awesome.  I hope you will consider subscribing to Smarter Every Day for the upcoming videos in this series.  I believe you will find them to be fascinating. <br><br>Also, I would like express my heartfelt gratitude for every Thinker and Doer that supports Smarter Every Day on Patreon at <a href=\"https://www.patreon.com/smartereveryday\">https://www.patreon.com/smartereveryday</a> . Seriously, I cannot say enough kind things about all of you.  All of you, of course, except Joseph Robinson. In the last video Joseph requested that I shoot a supersonic baseball at a gallon of mayo, and I still haven&#39;t quite forgiven him.

Mainly, the lighthouse is still an active &quot;aid to navigation&quot;, and is maintained by the CG. They also help and have regulatory authority over things like the ferries that bring people out to the island, as well as, if any of our tanks were to leak. We have fuel tanks for the generators, batteries for the solar system, water for drinking, sewage from the toilets, etc. Not very good if any of that leaked. <br><br>We actually had a ship on patrol out of Eureka, the USCGC Barracuda, pull up and pretty much ask &quot;hey, can we have a tour?&quot; &quot;Ya, sure, come ashore!&quot; A couple of us got tours of the ship, too. It was quite impressive, from the bridge, to the kitchen, the engine room, the sleeping quarters... Great running boat. I was also able to get a tour at Sector Golden Gate, right under the Golden Gate Bridge in Sausalito. Great people, great facility, AMAZING views. But, definitely high stress. They handle things like recovery of jumpers off the bridge. One of the guys I talked to had to do that his first day on duty. That why that particular surf station has the highest turn-over rate out of all the stations in the country (at least a few years ago). <br><br>Great group of folks.

And I don\u2019t think whiteboards had been invented yet. But most everything else looked very similar. Of course, they had desks for a dozen Action Officers, all of whom were Lt.Col. rank or higher (or equivalent grades in the Navy). So, the room was a bit bigger. And the Team Chief had his own office, which was locked separately from the rest of the space.<br><br>Back in the back, we Analyst/Terminal Operators were running on much older equipment connected to classified military mainframes that were built in the 60s. We started off with green screen text-based terminals, which were later replaced by IBM PC/XT systems with removable 5MB hard drives. We also had line printers.

And these can be done without the same protections and limitations as normal law enforcement. Normal law enforcement need probable cause, reasonable suspicion, plain sight evidence, and warrants to do searches or to stop someone. Legally, the USCG needs none of that for a stop, board, and inspect a vessel underway. Furthermore, the CG gets to write its own regulations on what is enforced. <br><br>And yet, as far as I know, the USCG has a really good relationship with recreational boaters in general, works well with industry, and tries to find a good balance between safety, environment, and economic needs.
