First, I enjoy your videos very much. Back to the cats. I think the flexure of the back is very important, and I picture the front and rear of the cat like the two rotors of a helicopter with with two main rotors. Coincidentally, any tail might also serve as a minor &quot;tail&quot; rotor. With the back bent, the whole body of the cat rotates in one direction, but opposite ends - viewed from their respective ends - are rotating in opposite directions, maintaining zero total angular momentum - and actually applying torque against one another (because of the division into two articulated axes the back bend provides). I think the back needs to bend at least a little bit, but the more bend the back can produce, I think the faster the cat can rotate.

But one time I kinda mess up and he ended up in a bit of a spin.  But before he got to the tree, only about 4 feet, he was able to get himself turned and latch on.  I decided to call this game Stick Cat.  It wasn&#39;t mean any more than dropping the cat upside down.<br>That was pretty cool, but I thought about trying other things, so I did what you were don&#39;t over a couch.  I did it from shorter and shorter distance until he couldn&#39;t make the transition.  Less than a foot, back of upside down cat to the couch.  Amazing.

We can see that at the end it is the same that at the beginning, since it&#39;s not rotating, but that is precisely what we observed, the interesting thing is why, you got positive and negative body rotation, but do they really have the same magnitude (in terms of momentum)? They don&#39;t, or the cat would finish upside, when he rotates the back legs downside the upper legs would go to the opposite direction again.

Do this simple experiment..., sit on a rotating chair (swivel chair) and grab a rotating object like a bike wheel. It should have some handles to grab it on its rotating axis. Ask someone to rotate fast the wheel and then raise your feet. Try to turn the wheel and see what happens..., magic, magic??

Just very chubby lol) or is she more sturdy than I think?   Second question. You mentioned at the end that you need to hold her above (I forget the actual number) feet.

I&#39;m not wholly skeptical of it either, but I have doubts. I think the proposed conservation-of-angular-momentum idea is one way it could be done, but I don&#39;t think it&#39;s the way that it is done. A straight cylinder can&#39;t just make itself roll, except by the divide-in-articulated-halves-and-extend-mass-from-the-axis method. But a V-shaped cylinder can turn fairly easily with coordinated contractions. And that&#39;s what the cat is doing. It reverses which aspect &quot;faces in&quot; to the V, then straightens. The role played by angular inertia/momentum is that accelerating the mass at the ends of the V is &#39;harder&#39; than accelerating the mass around the longitudinal axis. You would have a slight precession of the V caused by the rotation, but it&#39;s essentially stable in that plane. You&#39;d have to do the math to prove it, but I don&#39;t think you&#39;d get anything like the speed or control needed from extending one set of limbs, rotating that half, retracting those limbs, etc. and I don&#39;t think that&#39;s what we&#39;re actually seeing happen in the footage.\u00a0<br><br>Interestingly, if you look at &quot;cat righting reflex&quot; on wiki, the verbal explanation matches the one given here, but the animation illustrates &#39;my&#39; theory, and leaves out all the business with the moment of inertia of the legs etc, entirely.\u00a0", "comment_date": "2013-11-24T18:28:58Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Julian Pan", "comment_text": "This video is very disturbing!", "comment_date": "2013-11-24T14:14:05Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Divya Shree", "comment_text": "thank you, you&#39;re awesome!", "comment_date": "2013-11-24T12:03:31Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Animated Physics Werner Maurer", "comment_text": "A very good video about a complex phenomena.
