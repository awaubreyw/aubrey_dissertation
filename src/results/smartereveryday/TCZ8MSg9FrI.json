[{"comment_by": "Bill Douglas", "comment_text": "We humans could learn a valuable lesson from these ants about intuitively and coactively joining together to save one another. In situations when humans are in peril, although they sometimes work hand in hand for the good of all, too often it seems humans try to keep their own heads above water by standing on the shoulders of weaker humans, even if doing so forces the people on the bottom underwater. We humans rather hubristically have flattered ourselves as being the smartest species on the planet, only to learn that even insects can teach us things about survival that, sadly, do not seem to be part of our DNA heritage.", "comment_date": "2022-05-16T13:58:53Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "LameBMX", "comment_text": "Greeting from 2021", "comment_date": "2021-08-27T00:01:24Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "OilBaron100", "comment_text": "At first I thought that they were Brazilian fire ants.", "comment_date": "2021-08-02T23:36:16Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Mary Lagua", "comment_text": "the ants on the bottom can\u2019t move\ud83d\ude22\ud83d\ude22", "comment_date": "2021-01-25T21:22:30Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "anonymous", "comment_text": "Hi", "comment_date": "2020-11-22T05:17:07Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Mary Lagua", "comment_text": "Thanks Destin.
