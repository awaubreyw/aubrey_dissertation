When you snap your fingers you do not cause a sonic boom...snapping your fingers causes vibrations in the air.. when they reach your ear they are translated into sound based on their frequency..   Lightning when passing through the air causes it to rapidly expand then contract.(due to its temp of ~36,000 degrees F) . this causes vibrations in the air..", "comment_date": "2011-07-19T19:56:02Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "SmarterEveryDay", "comment_text": "@TTThienTN \nTake science seriously in school ....as in,  SERIOUSLY AWESOME", "comment_date": "2011-07-19T11:32:13Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "TTThienTN", "comment_text": "You should be my science teacher :) I&#39;m going to 8th grade -.-", "comment_date": "2011-07-19T04:33:48Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Edward Rosario", "comment_text": "@josyula547 just how the torch from a hot air ballon heats the air around it... a lighning bolt is around 50-100 time hotter so anything around it would heat and expand way fater... if you ever have a chance play with a stun gun... be very careful though its not lethal but its dangerois... youll notice it makes some kind of bang too not as loud as the thhunder but its prettu loud for its size and whats happening is the same thing thats happens with lightning...", "comment_date": "2011-07-17T21:42:02Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "bobbieorangeful", "comment_text": "@josyula547 well the static electricity is releasing its energy in the form of light (why you see the lightening), sound (why you hear the thunder) and heat- which transfers to the air around it heating it up.
