He said we have to do this because  the deer&#39;s live in a confined space &quot;a park&quot;   they have no natural predators to keep their numbers in check. (  Because the predators that kept their numbers in check also kept our numbers in check,  and we can&#39;t have  something  keeping our species down to unacceptable level  can we? )   if we allow them to just mindlessly multiply which they will, they will  destroy there environment for themselves and all the other wildlife that depend upon it.<br> So we have to keep them down to an acceptable level that their confined space, &quot;PARK &quot; cans naturally support.<br><br><br>I said&quot;  I understand the logic behind what you&#39;re doing,  but my question is why doesn&#39;t that logic apply to the human species.  He said I&#39;m not getting into that and walked away.   that&#39;s the trouble with the human species,  it can talk about the culling of other species  to keep their numbers in check so they don&#39;t destroy the environment,  but  the human species cannot talk about doing the same with its own species and keeping them down to an unacceptable level so they don&#39;t destroy their environment.<br><br><br> So really it&#39;s a pointless exercise isn&#39;t it,  because the human race is going to destroy the environment anyway, through overpopulation, through its inability to control its population level , so it doesn&#39;t destroy the confined space it lives in.<br>So it seems  the human species  can&#39;t practice what it preaches.   <br><br><br> what is laughable, it is the human species that has created this chaos on this planet through not controlling its numbers.<br>what&#39;s even more laughable when  humans claim to be the most intelligent life on planet,  that&#39;s the biggest joke.", "comment_date": "2019-07-06T07:20:53Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Larry Ehrlich", "comment_text": "I thought that I was watching a bunch of old women.", "comment_date": "2019-07-06T03:52:04Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Lucio Gatteschi num.quinto", "comment_text": "lo aiuteranno anche, ma mi sembrano proprio tre impediti ...", "comment_date": "2019-07-05T23:17:59Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Yili Bai", "comment_text": "Thank you, thank you, thank you for helping this buck who would otherwise have been a goner.", "comment_date": "2019-07-05T21:01:16Z", "likes_count": 9}, {"comment_by": "aristotels aristotals", "comment_text": "The cameraman needs some lessons.

And not perceiving a threat, owing to their genuine gentle and loving nature and that in a friendly, curious manner they have frequently walked right up to strangers, both human and animal, trusting to approach not expecting to be harmed- numerous videos have shown wild deer walking up to strangers to accept, befriend them and even to be pet. They don&#39;t seek people or anything to harm - and there&#39;s no real fight- just innocent helpless animals that have the right to defend themselves when threatened and their defense it to run away and escape, but if they can&#39;t because they are trapped, then it&#39;s not an option- thank God in His wisdom He taught them survival- everyone can understand that any animal in a vulnerable situation, injured, scared or threatened- not knowing the intentions of a particular person- whether that person means to rescue or harm them naturally may resist that person. That&#39;s not unusual. A video showed a rescuer determined to save a drowning dog and as he was being bit multiple times by the dog, he still continued to help him out.  He sustained numerous bites with no injury to the dog.  I was amazed that he didn&#39;t abort the rescue even after being repeatedly bitten.  He knew that the dog was likely to respond that way because he was afraid that the man was going to harm him.
