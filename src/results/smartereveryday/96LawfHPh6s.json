[{"comment_by": "Hevesh5", "comment_text": "It was so great to have you here at the Incredible Science Machine!! You brought so much energy to the team! Thanks for highlighting our event and doing this study - it was super fascinating to watch :)<br><br>This is exactly what I would have predicted: the bottom of the domino slips backwards more on surfaces with less friction and the domino line topples faster. I did my AP physics project on a similar concept and found that a smaller spacing on sandpaper (frictional surface) was SLOWER than a large spacing on sandpaper. What&#39;s interesting is that my original hypothesis was the exact opposite. From experience, usually a larger spacing is slightly slower on a normal wooden floor, but I didn&#39;t account for the floor surface when I made my hypothesis. A slippery floor surface (and also domino material, hence the color to speed variation) such as glass makes the dominoes fall faster.<br><br>You&#39;re right though that this is more complicated than we think, and having an unexplored area of domino physics is super exciting :) Can&#39;t wait to see what you discover in the next experiment!<br><br>Also a suggestion for starting the dominoes... I feel like we need some sort of motorized toppler that very, very slowly moves forward hitting the center of the first domino near the top. If you use a small spacing, the first domino may just lean against the next domino and not topple right away, but this would allow the bare minimum force required to topple the line. You&#39;re also right that a longer line is necessary so that the speed of the dominoes can reach terminal velocity. I&#39;m not 100% sure how many dominoes that is (this could also vary with spacing), but I&#39;d recommend maybe 50 in the line to be safe. Thanks again for coming! And now to watch the behind the scenes :D", "comment_date": "2017-10-01T15:19:49Z", "likes_count": 2004}, {"comment_by": "Steven Wolgast", "comment_text": "Just came here from an American Physical Society article link on domino friction research, even though I was here 4 years ago.

We found that in general more friction is better, some tricks just never worked in the hard and smooth surface. Then the dominoes bounce on the wood, and that combined with the slipping meant that things would be toppled unexpectedly. So surfaces like cork help cushion the fall and stop them from sliding away too far, they fall more neatly. I&#39;d love to see a longer line filmed by your high speed camera, of say 100 dominoes, and compare the falling speed of dominoes of different materials and colours. I wonder if the clear dominoes actually weigh more, maybe it was just the two dominoes you weighed. I&#39;d try weighing 100 and see if there&#39;s a statistical difference between the two groups.

For example: Filth as a soft material will expand unter the toppling domino, applying more upward force to the lifting end of the domino, than a hard surface would do, that does not expand.<br><br>2.) What you effectively create with falling dominoes is a rotational-transitional wave. Its speed is would be defined by something that represents mass of the elements and something that represents coupling stiffness.<br>   a) Higher mass of the dominoes would slow down the wave speed (effect on the translational wave)<br>   b) Higher moment of inertia of the dominoes would slow down the wave speed (effect on the rotational part)<br>        Here the friction comes into play. A domino on high friction surface is pivoting around a point on the surface and therefore<br>        has a higher moment of inertia than a domino pivoting around its center of gravity (Parallel axis theorem).<br>   c) the coupling is highly nonlinear and can only roughly be compared to linear wave.

The last<br>       domino would move instantaneously with the first one, but this would not be a chain reaction.<br><br>3.) For the spacing and speed we need to understand the effects that influence the wave speed, I would guess (in order of appearance):<br>    a) starting speed of the domino, given by pulse transfer from its predecessor<br>    b) reduction of speed by friction with its predecessor<br>    c) reduction  of speed by lifting the domino slightly when pivoting around its front corner<br>    d) increasing rotational speed by gravity during falling<br>    e) overlayed decrease of horizontal speed as function of the cosine of the falling angle<br>    f) fraction of pulse that is transferred to the next one as function of its angle<br>        - lower horizontal pulse with larger falling angle<br>        - contact point hight defines how much of the puls is transferred as translational and as rotational pulse<br>    g) part of the overall length, that is covered by spaces and part, that is covered by domioes (which internally have an comparable infinite wave speed).

This does not happen in praxis, but it shows, that there exist short spacings with pretty much zero speed. We even could think of a slightly larger spacing, where we just slightly overshoot this equilibrium and get just as much energy from the falling domino as to trigger the next one with the same minimum pulse. This would give a closed to zero speed chain.<br>* increasing spacing would likely increase speed for a while to a maximumg<br>* further increase of spacing would decrease speed, till we again reach a point, where the trigger puls is just enough to slightly overshoot the equilibrium, again a &quot;closed to zero speed&quot; chain.", "comment_date": "2017-10-18T23:13:24Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Logan", "comment_text": "As an alternative: use a pendulum, released with an electromagnet.

Loved the video, and enjoyed wracking my brain around creating an experiment to get representative results.  First, the question that originated the experiment will help to simplify some things. Since you are looking to see what factors impact steady state domino fall velocity, you should ignore data from however many dominoes it takes to reach steady state (in the video you said roughly 20) and the last few dominoes (since they don&#39;t fall on other dominoes in the same way the last 2-5 fall further and will skew your results). This first change helps your triggering issue because there should be convergence to a single steady state velocity when triggered at any speed below the steady state velocity, although if it still bothers you, you can achieve better precision with a pendulum with fixed starting height and mass. The second change is to alter only one parameter at a time to get the effect of that single parameter on velocity using a truth-table to construct your test cases (I assume you are already doing this, but didn&#39;t mention it in the video, so I thought I would add it). Lastly, I think it would add interest to mark out the center of gravity (on the side of each domino) so we can track the movement of the center as well as that of the leading edge (maybe easier to do that with a pen and jig rather than in video post-processing).

That is, less of its torque is eaten up by the force of friction at the interface between dominoes. But then this is another case where things need to be in equilibrium, as the dominoes will want to slide backward earlier on in their fall, which would give that force of friction at the domino/domino interface a greater moment, which would cancel some of the torque from the earlier, forcing domino.

Instead of focusing just on energy (like many comments), momentum is what determines the speed at which the dominoes fall with the same amount of energy. When the dominoes allowed to slip, they &quot;try&quot; to rotate around the center of gravity and you end up having less angular momentum (mass x distance) resulting in a faster turning movement thus making the whole row fall faster. Take a stick or anything long and sleek in your hand and try to rotate it quickly by first holding it by the very end and then compare that to gripping it in the middle and rotating it. It takes much less energy to get up to the same speed when you minimize the rotational momentum and so the dominoes fall faster when they&#39;re allowed to slide. Though I would be interested to know if that&#39;s true for much longer rows of dominoes. My reasoning is that because you&#39;re minimizing the momentum, the dominoes will impart less of their potential energy to the next domino when they collide (of course the total potential energy is the same for a falling domino). It might be that the slippery surface wins in the short run but after the domino row on the grippy surface has built up enough speed it could overcome it&#39;s initial disadvantage.<br>2.) Make the rows much longer. If a different surface produces a 0.001 second difference, it&#39;ll be much harder to detect with 10 dominoes than it is with a 100. Also you&#39;ll have less variation with different runs since all the minute differences in domino orientation and spacing will even out. The domino spacer you&#39;re using isn&#39;t exactly precision machinery after all. :) This will of course make it more difficult to fit all the falling blocks in a single camera frame with decent resolution. I&#39;m not sure what the solution should be. You could make it snake back and forth, but that might produce more variation than it eliminates. I suggest a single row filmed from as far as is sensible with your camera&#39;s resolution.<br>3.) A really non-high-tech solution for consistent pushing might be a feather. The idea is that you push it slowly with something that has just enough force to start the first domino to fall over. You want to eliminate the variation in pushing force. One way of doing it without any finely calibrated pushing device is using the absolute minimum amount of energy by slowly just barely tipping the first domino over. Then it doesn&#39;t even really matter at what height you&#39;re pushing it (as long as it&#39;s not sliding forwards when you do so). The downside with this is the difficulty in determining when the first block started to fall. I suggest just ignoring the first block in measuring the time and only considering the second block. It&#39;s much easier to tell the exact moment the first domino hits the second one.<br>4.) A monofilament test wire (a slightly fancier piece of fishing line) is also one option of pushing the dominoes over. Medical examination monofilaments are designed to push with the same force regardless of how hard you push it (they have just the right amount of bend). It would be much easier to aim precisely and are much less random than a feather. I suggest using the lightest monofilament that&#39;s sufficient to push a domino over so the force will be as consistent as possible. They are really cheap.<br><b>EDIT</b> Actually I like Hevesh5&#39;s idea of a very slowly moving motorized toppler better than the monofilament or feather.

Then if you press something on top of the dominoes (aka two-toothed gears) they aren&#39;t able to spin as fast, and this would translate into reduced spin (although it would result in increased translation, since in the actual setup, the &quot;two-toothed gears&quot; are totally free to translate --&gt; perhaps the fact that the dominoes are tall like they are favors rotation as the better transfer of energy down the domino line rather than translation, because as they rotate, they convert some of their gravitational potential into rotational momentum - a small portion of which is converted into translation, depending on the amount of friction present)", "comment_date": "2017-10-05T17:10:28Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Aykut C\u00f6mert", "comment_text": "You can use a basic servo motor that should be consistent", "comment_date": "2017-10-05T17:09:34Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Eric Cole", "comment_text": "I&#39;m watching this video after being in six sigma training and all I can think about is about performing a Taguchi DOE", "comment_date": "2017-10-05T16:41:41Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Collin Bruce", "comment_text": "vbt XD", "comment_date": "2017-10-05T15:25:55Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Collin Bruce", "comment_text": "Hello destin my name is collin me and my family have been watching your vidios for a while and were wondering if you could make a vidio on scoliosis my sister just got fbt a surgery to get rid of her scoliosis i would love if you did this for us thanks -Collin", "comment_date": "2017-10-05T15:25:31Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Falkore02", "comment_text": "Use something like a ball bearing on a double string (i.e. Newton&#39;s Cradle but with only one) and swing that from the same height so you get a consistent start to the fall.", "comment_date": "2017-10-05T15:19:27Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Emielzier", "comment_text": "probably using servo and a <a href=\"http://switch.it/\">switch.it</a> clicks and rotate at almost constant speed", "comment_date": "2017-10-05T15:18:59Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "JMRC", "comment_text": "I think the blocks with more friction fall slower because the center of gravity is behind the pivot point, which means that when it pivots, the center of gravity needs to go up slightly and overcome some gravity before it can use the gravity to accelerate on the way down.

The moment of inertia is determined by mass and geometry and floor friction determines the pivot axis and results in Steiner&#39;s theorem. This rotation determines where the stone will have the required energy. Stone speed is determined by falling height, stone-to-stone friction as well as air resistance. This looks like floor friction wouldn&#39;t matter as it is compensated by the ideal spacing while stone-to-stone friction and air resistance does matter as it determines the speed by which the next contact can be made. This makes a lot of sense as a chain of dominos is locally static but transmits information along the way, thus it is not influenced by friction against the outside world (the floor) but only by the friction inside the system.

I&#39;ll explain my thought below...<br><br>You can clearly see that dominoes on the slick surface pivot more than the dominoes on the grippy surface.This could be a result of a reaction to the lack of friction on the pivoting surface (right corner of domino) which allows the domino to appear to spin about it&#39;s center of gravity faster than a domino subjected to friction on that pivot surface. Therefore when the domino is on a relatively grippy surface, the domino slips less, thusly translating the rotational potential about the pivoting axis that is relatively fixed compared to the sliding ( or variable) axis on the domino on a slick surface. <br><br>Therefore, the main variance between the two domino sets is the change in friction on the pivoting plane. The slick surface domino has a &quot;sliding&quot; rotational axis, whereas the domino with the grippy surface has a &quot;fixed axis&quot;. As a result of this, the rotational axises between dominoes on a grippy surface versus one on a slick surface are in fact different.  A result of this difference in pivoting planes means that the center of gravity between both sets of dominos changes as well. The sliding domino has a higher center of gravity (more centralized), meaning it can pivot faster about it&#39;s pivoting point than the grippy surface domino. Since the distribution of mass across the pivot point can alter the speed of the rotation, an object with a centralized pivot point can rotate faster and smoother (think about it like a wheel, a center hub will spin more efficiently than offsetting the hub even just a few degrees). Further, due to the small size of dominoes, this difference is minute, (pivoting planes may only be a millimeter or less different) yet extrapolated out over hundreds or thousands of dominoes, this small variation compounds itself into a noticeable difference in speed. <br><br>A second possible hypothesis is that the resulting frictional interface between the domino and the surface it is rotating about  causes a reduction in potential energy of the system. We know that friction takes energy away from a system by converting some of the kinetic energy into another form of energy (like heat, which is how disc brakes on a car work). Looking at the highspeed footage it appears as though the  resting dominoes &quot;hop&quot; once the interaction with a falling domino is initiated. Therefore, in order to move, the domino must overcome not only it&#39;s resting state of motion (Newton&#39;s first law) but also the energy required to move it from the surface it touches (friction with the surface it sits on). This &quot;hopping&quot; is exactly that motion, overcoming it&#39;s resting state of motion. While the domino is in the air, it is allowed to rotate and accelerate freely (assuming the interaction with air is negligent). Yet when the domino lands back down on the surface it must rotate relative to it&#39;s contact point. On a slippery surface, the domino is allowed to rotate more freely thus inducing a sliding axis as a result of the rotational energy overcoming the resistance of the surface that it is contacting, whereas on the grippy surface, the domino is forced to rotate about the position it landed on since the domino does not impart enough energy on it&#39;s rotational axis to induce the slide. Since friction is working against the rotation (forces are in the opposite direction of the rotation) it can be said that energy is lost along the rotating plane on the frictional surface. And therefore friction along this rotational surface is acting much like a brake would. This would account for while the dominoes on the slippery surface, they &quot;kick back&quot; more than the dominoes on the grippy surface. As a result of this energy &quot;loss&quot; there is less forward potential kinetic energy and the overall system travels just slightly slower on the grippy surface than on the slippery surface.<br><br>Friction in this setting appears to act like that of rolling a tennis ball on a glass surface versus a turf surface on slopes that matched in slope angle and slope length. The tennis ball will roll faster down the glass slope than down the turf slope, since the energy imparted by friction is greater in the turf slope, the remaining potential energy that can be converted into kinetic energy will be reduced... Both systems have equal potential energies at the beginning of the experiment, but friction will limit the speed of the ball between the two experiments. I hypothesize that this is the case here as well.<br><br>However it could be a combination of both of these factors, or neither of them at all! thanks for reading and i look forward to finding a solution soon!", "comment_date": "2017-10-04T14:40:25Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Tony Zhu", "comment_text": "Pneumatic Piston with Restrictor.

I wouldn&#39;t worry about your initial tipping mechanism. As long as you have enough dominoes to get to steady-state, the initial push shouldn&#39;t change much.<br>2. If you don&#39;t worry about the initial push, the only thing you can&#39;t do is a &quot;race&quot; between two types of dominoes like you did in this video. But it was a little difficult to see. You can probably make up the difference in post by aligning two different runs top and bottom to get the same effect.<br>3. More slippery domino or surface means less friction, which should make the domino fall faster because the friction with the ground works against the direction of rotation, making them rotate and fall more slowly.<br>4. That being said, the dominoes with more friction should fall further forward for the same reason, allowing the grippy dominoes to be spaced even further apart, (slowing them down even more?). You saw the opposite in your tests so far, but that may have to do with how close the dominoes are spaced - if they are too close for this effect to matter, the more slippery dominoes may end up falling &quot;further&quot; because when the last one or two get &quot;squished out&quot; at the end of the drop, they can slide further before stopping. This may mean the speed difference between high and low friction also depends a lot on spacing.<br>5. I feel like heavier/lighter dominoes shouldn&#39;t play a huge roll. Think of the effect of dropping a heavy and light ball of the same size (Veritasium has some great videos on this). They end up falling at the same rate. But we&#39;re not dealing with spheres here, so it&#39;s possible rotational inertia has some different effects, and my instinct is way off.<br><br>Great work!", "comment_date": "2017-10-03T14:43:41Z", "likes_count": 2}, {"comment_by": "sarcasmo57", "comment_text": "I bet they get a bulk discount on dominoes.

I&#39;m not sure how this relates to arm but it makes me think that the dominoes slipping on a slippery surface go faster.  The forward motion may not have as much force as it is a shorter arm, but it can move forward faster as it really only has to move half of the domino forward and the other half moving backward which may help to reduce the time it takes to contact the next domino.

Harder materials deform less under impact, which gives them an elastic collision characteristic.  Elastic collisions are more efficient in transferring energy than inelastic collisions.  Think about the difference between dropping a steel ball bearing on a hard floor versus dropping a lead shot.  Since the steel ball is harder, it will bounce much higher than the lead ball, where energy is wasted deforming it (slightly) and lost as heat.  Similarly, ordinary dominos are most likely made of ABS, while transparent ones are acrylic, which I do believe is significantly harder.  This makes the collisions more elastic, so the acrylic line falls faster.<br><br>The pigments used for colors can potentially make a notable difference in material properties, including hardness.  Even though only a small amount of pigment is used, thus probably not influencing density noticably, the presence of the pigment molecules disrupts and changes the structure of the polymer.  This can be viewed in much the same way as adding just a few percent of carbon to iron makes steel, a much tougher material.<br><br>A quick thought:  You should verify whether the dominos are solid plastic or if they&#39;re hollow in the middle to save material costs.

You should try and select as many dominos as you can of roughly the same weight and put them on surfaces with different coefficients of friction.  A servo with a digital PWM controller/driver (RC controllers aren&#39;t quite exact enough) would allow you to contact the domino the same way every time.<br><br>As far as my hypothesis on the physics... On a perfectly smooth surface with rounded bottom edges the rotation would be purely around the CG and there would be no acceleration in the system. You would see both a rotational and translation momentum transfer (again assuming perfection) that would be equal to the force that you put into the system. However, as you increase friction the pivot point becomes further away from the CG which will allow more acceleration due to gravity therefore resulting in an eventually faster fall. Same thing goes for heavier dominoes; the contribution of gravity will be more significant. However there has to be a terminal velocity, so what is the constraining factor? Possibly loss of energy during the momentum transfer? You must also take into account the elasticity of the dominos as that will effect how quickly and efficiently the momentum is transferred. On a smooth surface however the moment of inertia is smaller and therefore the angular speed will be greater for the same amount of energy.<br><br>A lot of different variables on this one and it will bug me (as I&#39;m sure it will you) as I think about it over the next couple days.", "comment_date": "2017-10-02T05:47:05Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Dr.ZachMan", "comment_text": "What if they would black out the top of the domino so when they fall they reveal what the message says instead of it already showing the message", "comment_date": "2017-10-02T05:46:13Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Faded Chicken", "comment_text": "The computer that simulates this reality almost struggled to run that", "comment_date": "2017-10-02T05:45:08Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Zach Crawford", "comment_text": "You could use a small pendulum and always release it at the same angle every time to push the first domino", "comment_date": "2017-10-02T05:41:13Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "TheLIMPLINK", "comment_text": "I would use a small pendulum which is fixed with a small string which you can burn away.

Here&#39;s my idea on how you should try your experiments on Dominoes:<br> 1- For the triggering, I suggest you do it the same way (pushing with a stick), or with a falling block. You can also try with the stick and look how they would fall with the stick hitting the block at different places (top of the brick, bottom or center) and different speeds ( like throwing the stick or gently pushing the block). See how any of these variables makes a difference. <br> 2- If you don&#39;t want to change how you trigger the chain, do this: Have a long start section that is let&#39;s say 1m long. First, make sure the fall is not accelerating after the start length, so do some tests to find the suitable length. Keep this section consistent between all of your tests, for example opaque plastic white color for all bricks, on hard floor, and average spacing. Choose a color that is the same color as the background, so that you don&#39;t see them when the test fall is started. After this long section put your test bricks. This way you have an actual brick that is triggering the fall in your test section. <br> 3- In each test, start your timer when the first test brick touches the second test brick. I think this is more accurate than looking at when a brick starts to fall. Also calculate the timing for the rest of the bricks when they touch each other (like each 100 bricks fall in 1.5 second).<br> 4- In all of the tests, have a longer test section to have a longer duration for the experiment. That way your accuracy for the time of falling and measurement of speed is better (consider the error of 10ms in 100ms vs 1000ms) <br> 5- for each test you should keep all variables constant except one. <br>  a. In a series of tests, keep all bricks as blue plastic (in contrast to the background color), same spacing, same starting length, and just change the ground material. <br>  b. In a different series, keep the ground material, length, spacing and brick material consistent, but change the brick colors.<br>  c. Try bricks with different spacing, but keep everything else the same. <br>  d. Try brick with different materials (like plastic, wood, metal, acrylic, etc.) I think the impact of each brick on the other one has an effect here.<br>  e. I&#39;m sure the air drag has an effect on the falling speed ( assume the whole chain was in water) but I guess the change in that variable is very negligible (due to air temperature and humidity)<br> 6- If you are trying side by side tests, take the video from top (to see both rows better) and again calculate your timing for when the bricks touch each other. <br> 7- One of the things I like to see is where the block pivots around (the instantaneous rotation center). See if this point changes for different blocks, and different frictions. <br> 8- Investigate the impact between the blocks: Is it a very fast touch (big force, short time) or slow touch (small force, bigger time). I know we can&#39;t measure the force from the camera, but we can measure the time they touch each other. <br><br>I have two more ideas on dominoes (Variable spacing on your template, and loop the loop track) which I will share with you if only you answer to my comment above.

It has to do with moment of inertia, if my hypothesis is correct. A mass spinning about it&#39;s center has a much lower moment of inertia than a mass rotating about it&#39;s end, so more total energy is translated in the long run. So, a slipping domino means more energy rather than less, probably?<br><br>Looking at Hevesh5&#39;s pinned comment saying that larger spacing on grippy dominoes is faster, the above may also explain that. The time from one domino to the next is the time from initial impact and zero velocity to final impact with some acceleration and energy. A short distance means lower acceleration but also lower time. My hypothesis is that for slipping dominoes there is more  rotational acceleration so gravity cannot accelerate it fast enough to outweigh the benefit of a quick impact and short spacing. The initial energy transferred to the domino is mostly kept, so the domino can just pass that on without needing gravity to do much work.

The actual difference between slippery and adherent surfaces seems to be a change on the axis of rotation. For slippery the axis is closer to the center of mass, while for adherent is at the bottom corner -- like in textbooks.<br><br>In this case the change in speed may be interpreted as a change in the moment of inertia of the rotating dominoes. Because the moment of inertia increases when the axis of rotation moves to the bottom corner, for the domino to have the same energy -- which comes from the gravitational potential, hence is roughly the same in all cases -- it rotates more slowly. And I believe that the energy loss due to friction on the slippery case is not enough to cancel the effect of changing the rotation axis, then the slippery rotates faster.<br><br>To estimate how many dominoes you need to achieve terminal velocity you probably can check the video you show at <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=96LawfHPh6s&amp;t=10m09s\">10:09</a>. I believe it has to do with the number of dominoes moving while one of them is being toppled -- I counted about 20 in this particular video. I think the weight of all these dominoes participate on the toppling of the next standing one, then you should count back from the standing one down to the fist steady toppled. Also, this is a soliton system and maybe it would be worth it to check soliton properties to figure that out too. There is also a more practical -- or maybe not -- way to check this; did you notice that the sound they make when falling changes frequency?

What setup covers the most distance in the shortest time and what setup tumbles the most. If the dominoes are close, the contact point will be high, and therefore the individual domino will never accelerate to a high velocity before impacting the next. Where as far spacing would result in a lower point of impact and an higher individual velocity, which would result in a quicker acceleration of the next domino due to the increased falling speed, but also a longer distance to be covered before impacting the next, therefore maybe a delayed acceleration of the next. So it might be that there is a somewhat constant tumbling pace and a different coverage, or it might be that dominoes that are close will eventually reach the same falling speed but might just do it slower. If that is the case, it would be fun to see the correlation between distance covered, the number of dominoes tumbled, spacing and time. Would the closely spaced dominoes reach the same falling speed as the far spaced, in the same amount of dominoes? or maybe in the same distance? Is there a constant there or are they somehow correlated in a graph. There is so much to to ponder here, too much for a YouTube comment. So many variables, but I am almost certain that it can be fitted into a relatively neat equation, but if we add different weighted ends it could get even more interesting.

That way you can compare steady state speeds and figure out general trends in the behaviours of different coloured dominoes. <br><br>My hypothesis is that on a surface with more friction, the force of friction causes a net reduction in the torque about the CG which causes each domino to topple slower as compared to on a low friction surface. It would be interesting to study the difference between rolling (as in the case of a wheel; where more friction is better) vs. toppling (as in the case of these dominoes; where more frictions seems to slow it down).

On top of this, friction should dissipate some of this energy,  making the dominoes on high-friction surfaces even slower?

Then you raise the hinged domino to a consistent height and release it, causing it to swing down and hit the first domino at speed. This can be calibrated to force the dominoes to accelerate to maximum speed more quickly, without altering that speed.<br><br>With regards to the physics involved in the dominoes that &quot;slip&quot;, if the &quot;unhinged&quot; (being freed from the hinge effect of friction surfaces) dominoes rotate around their center of mass, that means that the distance from the edge of the domino from the fulcrum is shorter. At first this alters the rotation path of the edge to be longer from point A (upright) to crossing line B (the face of the next domino) thus increasing the time it takes to hit the next domino over it&#39;s hinged counterpart. However with it&#39;s more distant mass being closer to the fulcrum (like a figure skater pulling in their arms for a spin), the domino also rotates at a higher speed thus decreasing the time it takes to hit the next domino. The changes should mostly cancel each other out except the increased speed of the domino also increases the effects of air resistance on either side of the fulcrum as compared to the slower-moving hinged domino, slowing it down. On the other hand, the increased distance from the fulcrum of the edge of the hinged-domino also increases the amount of torque effect that air resistance has on it, thus further complicating matters. <br><br>Then you have to consider the changes in momentum. With a higher amount of torque from the edge of the hinged domino it imparts more of it&#39;s energy to the next one, but with a higher amount of speed, the unhinged has more energy. Then there&#39;s the matter of where it hits the next domino, since the hinged domino&#39;s arc path causes it to hit the next domino higher up, increasing the amount of torque it applies to the next domino over the unhinged version. Lastly, the angle the domino is traveling and thus how perpendicular it&#39;s velocity is to the desired direction of movement (horizontal), where the unhinged domino&#39;s edge movement is angled more down than the hinged version and thus less energy is passed in the horizontal direction.<br><br>TLDR; By my estimations, given all other factors like height, mass, and air density are identical, dominoes which remain hinged should individually fall more slowly, but as a set topple more rapidly, than dominoes which &quot;slip&quot; or become unhinged from the friction of their resting surface.

For the bottom of the rod in the frictionless case, the rotation is backwards and has a larger velocity contribution than the center of mass motion. As a result, the bottom gets a backwards velocity.<br><br>When there is friction, this will counteract the motion of the bottom of the rod. That implies that the frictional force is <b>forward</b> (not what you might expect). This forward frictional force produces a torque on the center of the rod opposite to the impulse causing a slower rod rotation speed compared to the frictionless case. The forward frictional force also increases the center of mass velocity.<br><br>So friction has two effects: to increase the center of mass velocity and to reduce the rotation. These have opposite relations to the velocity of the top of the rod/domino. Thus the result depends on the relative magnitude of the two, which depends on the moment of inertia. There is a threshold that separates the two possibilities, i.e. whether friction increases or decreases toppling speed. This occurs when the center of mass moment of inertia I = (1/4)*M*L^2. Here the bottom has no velocity even in the frictionless case, so friction isn&#39;t needed and contributes zero force, so it doesn&#39;t affect the toppling speed.<br><br>Edit: now that I think about it, that threshold looks like the maximum possible moment of inertia for any shape of length L about its center of mass; concentrate all the mass at the two ends and that&#39;s what we get.

Make a pendulum whose motion is restricted between 180 degrees and 270 degrees. You can probably add a little extrusion to the pendulum to act as the impact head. Raising the pendulum to 180 degrees each time will give you a consistent impact velocity. Also, because the impact will occur at 270, you&#39;ll always get a horizontal impact. For a smaller impact velocity, you can mark different angles between 180 and 270 for your starting position.<br><br>2) I think that the way a set of dominoes should be set in motion is by having the first one topple with zero initial velocity. This means that you&#39;ll need to push the first domino with the bottom pivot point at rest till it reaches the unstable configuration in a pseudo-static fashion and then release it. This would be more difficult to achieve because of two reasons. 1) The pivot point (bottom-right corner) might translate if the friction is low and 2) Achieving pseudo-static motion is difficult.

Let&#39;s take the extreme limits of zero friction and perfect friction (no sliding at all): then, as you noted, the zero-friction dominos tend to rotate about their center of mass, and for regularly-shaped dominos, that&#39;s the center of the rectangle. Meanwhile, in the perfect-friction case, they fall over the bottom corner. Moment of inertia is higher for objects about their end vs. about their middle, so for the same force (the domino&#39;s weight at any given angle), the domino rotationally accelerates less quickly. I&#39;d have to do the calculations, but I think the rotational acceleration is a bigger effect than the sliding backwards, which is why the more-slippery ones fall faster - the rotational acceleration somewhat follows an exponential growth because it&#39;s an inverted pendulum, so changes in angle due to an initial quicker rotational acceleration would be the dominating factor over any linear or quadratic factor, which I think the floor&#39;s frictional effect is.<br><br>Actually, now that I think about it, it might also have to do with the height of the domino, too.

It&#39;s so great to see dominoes on your channel! :D <br>I really love the idea of super-slo-mo dominoes for a speed analysis. I was going to point out the flaws of your first experiment with the acceleration of the dominoes and the inconsistent start, but i was glad to see you pointing that out just a few moments later :D<br><br>First of all, to Sprice bashing &#39;us europeans&#39; ^^: It&#39;s not about the paint or the dye, it&#39;s about the material of the dominoes. Each color of the dominoes has a slightly different mixture of plastic, at least here in germany (In europe, the BulkDominoes that you have aren&#39;t as popular due to high shipping costs. There is a different manufacturer here, but i&#39;m guessing the dominoes still act the same and the differences are not significant.) <br>Second, i think the color aspect is by far the smallest factor of the three you listed. I&#39;m sure, the floor and the spacing have a way bigger impact on the speed of the dominoes than it&#39;s color. On a gym&#39;s floor (this is, where most of the bigger domino events take place) a line of dominoes with the standard distance (the distance you get with the swagger stick :D) falls at about 63-64 dominoes per meter with 1m/s, no matter which color. (At leasts, thats what i&#39;m calculating with ^^)<br>There is one video, where the difference in color was measured (again, with european dominoes). /watch?v=VLrU8si8rgc<br>There you can see, how small the difference is. However, it is possible that all those times were just sheer coincidence and the material has no influence at all. To get accurate numbers, a bigger experiment would be necessary. (I don&#39;t know, maybe that&#39;s what you are looking for ^^)<br><br>Now for the tips for your experiment: <br>I&#39;m guessing, a domino line of 50cm to 100cm would be good as the dominoes will surely fall at a constant speed at the end of the line. And that&#39;s exactly where to put the ruler, at the end of the line. With that high speed camera, you will get so accurate resultst, i&#39;m really looking forward to it! :D <br>For a consitent start, I&#39;m guessing some kind of simple lego or k&#39;nex construction that topples the dominoes is enough to ensure, that the dominoes are always toppled equally.<br><br>I really was amazed to see the dominoes falling close up in super slow motion. It is so amazing to see something that i worked with so many hours in a completly different way. You said in the video that normally with super slo mo, a whole new world gets exposed and that it wasn&#39;t the case here, but to me it was! And i really appreciate that. Thank you for this great video. I would be stoked to see a part two of thuis experiment!<br><br>This comment took way longer than expected but it was worth the time.

This is because the moment of inertia depends on the distance of the mass from the axis of rotation squared. Therefore the slipping domino should at least &quot;spin&quot; faster, because it does not take that much momentum to accelerate him to the same angular velocity. Now the difficult part starts: The distance between the top edges of the dominos beeing fixed, the dominos turning around their bottom edge need to turn for a smaller angle than the ones turning around their centre. Now the maths: The inertia: I(centre)=(m*R^2)/12  ,    I(edge)=(m*R^2)/3  , with R length of the domino and m the mass. Now the big assumption on my side: The momentum of one domino transfered to the next one is about the same in the slipping case as it is in the case with high friction and a fixed edge (I dont really think this is true, it should be a little less than the domino not slipping, because the slipping domino also moves back at the bottom and therefore despite having the same angular momentum than the other one it could transfer less of it to the next domino ...). So with the same momentum p transfered we get the same angular momentum L for both of our cases (also because it is conserved in any closed system, which, unfortunately, is not really the case here). With a formula for the angular velocity   w=L/I   and    I(centre)=(1/4)*I(edge)    we get a factor of    w(centre)=4*w(edge). Now lets see by which angle they need to turn to get to the next stone: Using trigonometry we get: a(edge)=sin^-1(d/l)   and   a(centre)=sin^-1(2*d/l)    with d the distance between the dominos and l the length of the dominos. The rotation around the centre only uses half the length of the domino to get to the next one, which gives us the factor 2 in the sin^-1. <br>Now we put the angular velocity and the angle in one equation and we get: a=w*t   therefore  t=a/w   and therefore   t(centre)/t(edge)=(1/4)*sin^-1(2*d/l)/sin^-1(d/l). This does not help us that much until we use a little approximation for small angles, which are given in our case if d is much smaller than l: sin^-1(c*x)~c*x<br><br>This all leeds me to the assumption that the factor t(c)/t(e)~1/2<br><br>This of course is not the one and only truth, its just an assumption for really close dominos which perfectly conservate the momentum created by the first one tipping over. In reality each domino adds some more momentum by beeing pulled down by earth and when the row reaches &quot;terminal velocity&quot; the same amount of momentum is transfered back to the air and the material they stand on. But I hope this little calculation gave some insight or ideas to people who want to take the concept even further.

One of our builders tried timing sideways dominoes falling and found they fall at almost exactly half the speed of vertical dominoes.

My question is - was it just a coincidence that reducing the height of the domino by half reduced the speed by half?

No pumps or anything. Just a bottle of water, some tubing, and something at the end like a piston that moves when the water pressure is high enough to push it. So you would need like a valve to open. It would not be perfect, but it would output the same amount of pressure each time to the piston.<br><br>Another way, that also isnt perfect, but would be pretty close, would be to use something as a &quot;kicker&quot; and put it on a pivot. When lifted back to its trigger point, have something it rests on that is always at the same height. When it is removed, the &quot;kicker&quot; would fall down and knock over the dominos. But you would probably want to put something on the front of the kicker to hit the domino, and then a stop so it cant go over a certain point. That way it always stops at the same spot.

I have never really thought of the dominoes slipping. <br>As far as a consistent domino initiator, ideally you would likely want to take out any initial velocity component by only allowing the center of mass to affect the speed. To do this maybe you could use some sort of servo to push it very slowly until the domino effectively tips over at its \u201cnatural\u201c speed you should only need to tip the middle of the domino past the bottom corner, setting up a servo to do that should give consistency. <br>As the dominos fall in the beginning I would think the speed would mostly increase until the first domino fell to the ground completely, as each domino falls on the one in front of it there is a stacking effect so the 5th domino actually has the last 4 dominos pushing on it \u2013 at least until the first domino falls as mentioned before. <br>As far as the slipping goes for the increased velocity I can think that is there is less friction then more of the energy should be transferred. Initially you were thinking the bottom is moving backwards so more of the energy is moving backward. I think the domino instead of the forces just being translational the domino has translational momentum and angular momentum. The domino spins so it is not that the bottom if the domino is moving backward, the whole domino is spinning and moving forward those forces should be additive when contacting the next domino in line.<br>As far as the mass effecting the speed that may be because of the overall potential energy being higher. If the dominos are the same height at the beginning and the end for both a lighter and a heavier domino the potential energy change will be greater for the heaver dominos. Since almost all of the energy is transferred to kinetic energy the dominos should move faster with a heavier domino. At least until you account for friction where there is more friction for a heavier domino\u2026<br>Something else I thought about is the material could possibly an influence on the dominos falling ie the bounce from the dominos colliding (the coefficient of restitution I think it is called). Also the elasticity of each domino could change things - how much of the energy goes into bending the domino vs just translational movment. That factor is likely too small to be a measured though\u2026 at least until you make human sized dominos (next video?)<br>A lot of physics going on for sure.

The quick release could be anything, even a skewer blocking the pendulum rod. It won&#39;t be perfectly repeatable, but because you&#39;ll need, for example, to extend it by 2&quot;, the minuscule differences in pendulum release shouldn&#39;t matter. In essence, the pendulum acts like a lens on light, magnifying the triggering motion, so that it&#39;s controlled on a different level of magnitude. <br><br>Also, block the pendulum at the trigger point and fix the first piece so it always rotates against the bottom edge (use a hinge or an axis) - more on this later. <br><br>About measuring the speed - you either need a longer chain of dominoes to let them achieve their top speed or adjust the pendulum increasing its momentum, so it transfers more energy to the first piece until you see an acceleration only on the first few pieces. You still need some, but that might cut down on setup time and allow you for more repetitions, which I believe would be more important. <br><br>And another thing - you don&#39;t need to focus only on the speed of progression. You can focus on each individual piece triggering the next one. How much time passes from when the piece starts moving to when it reaches the next one? Where&#39;s the point of contact? Does the point of contact influence the speed of rotation of the next piece?<br><br>Remember that first piece on a hinge/axis? Make a couple of different ones rotating about a different point, like make one with an axis through its centre of mass, and another in between the centre of mass and the bottom edge. That way you have a repeatable way to see exactly what happens at a single point of progression when one piece triggers another. <br><br>Finally, my prediction - I&#39;d say that both increase in mass and decrease of friction would increase the speed of the progression, but the friction would have a more significant influence. I&#39;m thinking it all comes down to how fast a single piece can trigger the next one. For that, you need the piece to have enough momentum to overcome the next one&#39;s inertia, as well as speed so it reaches it faster. Luckily, speed also influences momentum, so speed would be essential here and have a greater influence than mass. Now, because the pieces are so close together, our piece will trigger the next one regardless of whether our piece rotates around (in approx.) the bottom edge or the centre of mass, but in the latter, there&#39;s less inertia that the rotation has to find against, so I believe that&#39;s faster. However, if the pieces were further away from each other, there would be a tipping point on the graph (piece spacing vs progression speed), indicating a spacing at which an <b>increase</b> in friction translates to an increase in progression speed, because the difference of axis of rotation would have a much more pronounced influence on the angle of contact between two pieces, and thus the momentum it can pass to the next piece. <br><br>Sorry for the long read, but I wanted to be thorough. ;) Can&#39;t wait to see the followup!", "comment_date": "2017-10-01T10:49:39Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Jig", "comment_text": "Do they count in the force of the initial push to the falling speed of the dominos?

It becomes a translation only if the stationary domino is hit dead center of it&#39;s COG.

You&#39;ll need to eliminate the variables by selecting the same kind of domino for your cascade. This may include weighing each domino with a sensitive scale and grouping them by mass. Take one group and go with that. Your spacing and surface selection are easier because you have a domino spacing guide and you can choose what surface to use. Once you have your setup, don&#39;t change anything until you&#39;ve run enough cascades that you are confident you&#39;ve eliminated your variables.<br>During your experiment, you have to figure out the acceleration and velocity part.

This is an easy measurement that tests my intuition.<br><br>About measurements of the final velocity and the corresponding motion of the dominos:<br>If you only want to look at the motion of the dominos when they have reached the final velocity, you just need to have enough length of dominos under the same circumstances (distance, surface material etc.) before your measurement.

Mount it on a simple plywood stand that can be clamped or screwed down to the test surface. Rather than using an expensive RC controller and the radio set, you can get servo testers for around $5.<br>The servo is activated by a potentiometer, that allows you to alter the speed at which the servo moves. Whilst this might be good for trying different starting methods, the human controlled motion could introduce another variable into your research.<br>To eliminate this you can control a servo with a microcontroller like an Arduino. A little more expensive but with the addition of a push button switch you can have the Arduino control the speed and motion of the servo. The code for this or &#39;sketches&#39; are all available online. <br>An Official Arduino will be around $30 but for those on a budget, a clone of the open source design can be found on ebay for under $5. <br><br>A simple mechanical solution would be to build a pendulum that is released with a spring type clothes pin. To stop the pendulum knocking down more than the first domino, add a stop, with padding. The only issue with this, is if the pendulum has too much stored kinetic energy when it hits the stop, the energy will be dissipated as vibration of the whole structure. This would possibly knock over more dominoes, or the vibration would add another variable into your experiment. Also if you want to get very serious about reducing variables, air pressure changes between tests may influence the speed of the falling pendulum. Higher pressure air, may slow the pendulum introducing slightly less energy into the system. But now we are getting into minute variables now. I don&#39;t know how precise you want to be.<br><br>For the sake of controlling the amount of energy added to the system by the initiation, I&#39;d go with the electo-mechanical Arduino system.

If the friction is to high it wont fall as fast cause the longer side would have to overcom the gravitational centre of the earth what means it is not accelerating as quickly. Of course it would be able to reach further into the line of other dominos but that makes no difference, unless the dominos would stand further apart so that the long range of the dominos with a lot of friction could lead to an faster and faster fall cause the energy is getting forwarded into the next Domino.

What you want is an istantaneous (pardon me, I don&#39;t know if that&#39;s correct in english) impulse.<br>You could ask your local university to use an air cushion track. You&#39;d have to weight the cart and you could use laser time gates (they usually have those mounted on the track) to measure the speed of the cart before the collision. Furthermore you could have consistent initial velocity using a spring to launch the cart and an istantaneous impulse by using stops on the track. By doing this you&#39;d have one variable under control. I know it&#39;s overcomplicated, but that&#39;s how a physicist would do it :D and it would also be entertaining to watch.

First, you&#39;re absolutely correct that the domino line needs time to accelerate before it reaches a constant speed. If the dominoes are spaced very close together, this might require more dominoes than you would expect. I would let at least 10 fall over before you begin measurement. If you do this, however, then you definitely do not need to worry about how much force you use to knock over the first domino (so long as you don&#39;t hit it with an extremely large amount of force). By the time those first 10 or so dominoes have fallen over, the line should be toppling at the same speed regardless of how hard you pushed the first domino.<br><br>I would also suggest that, when you&#39;re timing the line of dominoes, you should stop the clock when the second-to-last domino first touches the last one. I wouldn&#39;t stop the clock when the last domino hits the ground. Since the last domino has further to fall than all of the others, it ends up rubbing against the second-to-last one a good bit before it hits the ground. Therefore, if you wait until the last domino hits the ground to stop the clock, your results may be skewed toward concluding that the dominoes with lower friction are faster.<br><br>Anyway, this was a fantastic video.

Maybe someone&#39;s already mentioned this or you&#39;ve thought about it yourself, but regarding the friction of the dominoes my guess is you&#39;ve correctly identified that a higher friction between domino and ground surface makes for a faster falling train of dominoes. However, I also stipulate that there&#39;s a great deal of influence that comes from the friction between the actual dominoes, since their surfaces slides against each other when falling over. I.e a higher friction between the actual domino pieces would result in a slower moving domino train, since the falling forward motion would be hindered.<br><br>I&#39;m not sure I&#39;ve interpreted your video correctly, but if I have you were wondering about some inconsistencies in the train travelling speed between the opaque and see-through dominoes, the see-through dominoes moving faster even though they have a lower friction between themselves and the ground surface. I&#39;m willing to bet though that the see-through dominoes also has a much lower frictional coefficient between themselves, and thus their falling motion is much smoother and less hindered than the opaque ones.<br><br>//Oscar", "comment_date": "2017-10-01T07:06:51Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Dan B.
