This is my attempt to explain what&#39;s good about YouTube, and to encourage decisions within YouTube&#39;s leadership to consider leaving a bit of money on the table in favor of protecting the beautiful cathedral that they have created for us.  Following the short-term numbers will destroy the beautiful thing you have created, but if you stay the course and stay true to Your Voice, I believe the fact that Educational content thrives here on YouTube will ultimately make you win in the end.  Thank you to those who work at YouTube for making a platform where beautiful things like this can exist.

This is what (I perceive is) the problem with the music industry. Nearly all music today is marketing driven, and not a true artist creation. There are those that say they are artists, but then hire a producer that will make them rich. They immediately change the music in any way necessary to make tons of money. The true artists, and I know several, that refuse to do this. They often sacrifice the chance to become music giants, and this is OK with them. These artist cannot change a song that they created, it would be wrong. Most songs come from deep within, and they are what they are. Most of these true artists have the attitude that if an audience likes the tune, then great, if they don&#39;t that&#39;s great too - but don&#39;t ask them to change it to sell more copies. If Picasso had gone to a art &quot;producer&quot;, they would&#39;ve told him that he should try to make the lines connect.

My students are leaving YouTube and flocking to other platforms that are quicker, more instantaneous, and &#39;trendy&#39;.  This is a problem but where they are. They aren&#39;t on YouTube and I don&#39;t know if they are coming back.  <br><br>\r<br>\r<br>Other platforms have a younger audience in general but are more surface level in the learning or void of any positive learning at all (you can see this clearly in some of the ratios between numbers and actual creators and what the content actually is).  They want to consume something short, quick, and are not necessarily adverse to learning just maybe not in a &#39;longform&#39; format (it&#39;s crazy what that means to my students as of today).  I know my four year old views food the same way but I think it&#39;s important that he gets the nutrition he needs to grow.

I think they were disney characters. I can&#39;t recall. I wonder if those type of viewers still exist. Anyway i sometimes like to look at old photos or places or people and image what their life was like. There are some old film footage from the turn on the century or early on YT that also have the same effect. People staring back at this weird technology called  a film motion camera, and some 100+ years later a million people will stare back at them. Its weird. But also makes you think. They never would conceive people will have film and still image tech in every pocket. In many ways it makes the world smaller and more of a distraction where one can feel like going down a fast river of time. Looking at a still image somehow for a moment, feels like freezing time.

Here is a point I didn&#39;t hear in this video: It may depend on your voice&#39;s purpose.

If you want to use your voice to educate, for example, it may be in your interest to use these algorithms and different methods to be able to reach more people. You came down on Shorts (and TikTok, etc.) in this video, but if that&#39;s how people are consuming media, then I can see a reason for using those spaces to get out a message because that&#39;s where it&#39;ll be heard. So, I wouldn&#39;t come down too hard on creators who adjust things for what they think people might want to hear--at least to some degree--because that&#39;s how they&#39;ll get heard. Sure, maintain &quot;your voice&quot; but I think there&#39;s also a point of going too far with that in which you don&#39;t compromise at all and lose your audience.

This, I feel might add some nuance to the data and make it more relevant (you may be getting more views, but less % of subcribers than you were getting with shorter vids.

It improves the quality, certainly, because people are competing for attention, and there is plenty to look at. But the advertising and commercialism are killing it for me. It is what happened with TV. More ads than content. What brought you there becomes less important than what keeps you away. All those smart people figured out what people wanted and when they wanted it and what ads would sell that soap powder, and people just got bored. Talk shows all had the same jokes. Sit coms all did the same thing. News all focused on sensation. You are right to worry about how that is going here. They have you selling their doodads in your own videos.

I wanted to comment on Notre Dame de Paris and its restoration. The man primarily responsible for the past restoration of this cathedral, and many others, was Viollet Leduc, who worked around the time of Napoleon, but lived long enough to influence the early Chicago skyscraper architects. <br><br>This influence arose from his appreciation of the capabilities of cast iron, the carbon fibre of his age. He realized that the form of the Medieval cathedral \u2013 what we call the Gothic \u2013 was in many ways as pure an expression of engineering logic as could be achieved in their era. Without calculus and infinitesimal mathematics, those architects/masons/designers were trying to pull the most out of material available. When Viollet Leduc recreated the spire that fell so spectacularly in the fire, he used (I believe) cast iron to do so, something that wouldn&#39;t have been possible for the original buliders. The original had been removed because it couldn&#39;t stand up to the wind loads.<br><br>So, it was natural that Louis Sullivan would be influenced by him. And, I would argue, it puts Notre Dame in an engineering continuum, where the continuous duty of care is to respect the original construction, but also to consider what the underlying motivations were \u2013 to express the aspiration of the human spirit through the medium of engineering and technology.\u00a0<br><br>Another architect who was massively influenced by Viollet Leduc was Gaudi, who, when he inherited Sagrada Familia, it was a traditional neogothic cathedral of the type that Viollet LeDuc had defined. Saudi&#39;s transformation of the Sagrada Familia into the extraordinary structure \u2013 and I&#39;m sure that you know about the incredibly inventive use of suspended chains that were used as a kind of early CAD that anticipates what Gehry and others have used to liberate building structure \u2013 set the tone for a building that is continuously being reinvented as an engineering invention of staggeringly comprehensive scope.<br><br>Change is good.

Because we have to...<br>Thing is our cities are so old that if we didn&#39;t renovate and update them, they&#39;d simply die. Although I do agree that a monument like the Notre dame should be kept as original and intact as possible, this just isn&#39;t possible or plausible or viable for many other buildings. There&#39;s just too many. If we kept and maintained every historical building in its original form, our cities would turn into dead museums full of empty, lifeless, well preserved shells.<br><br>Old buildings need to be renovated to give them new life, so they can be used and maintained for another 1000y. These buildings often were built to last, but they were also built to be used. So it makes sense to keep them as intact as possible, but to also update them, keep them in use, and keep them alive for generations to come.<br><br>Great example of this can even be found with monuments, like for example the Louvre in Parijs. It was updated/upgraded to handle more tourists and visitors, to keep the museum alive, but also to maintain it as it is by adding another modern entrance. And this is the now famous glass pyramid of the Louvre. The Louvre had been there for centuries. Many protested the construction of the pyramid. But it allowed the Louvre to continue into the 21st century, and it has become so iconic and so part of the Louvre now, now no-one can even imagine the Louvre without it anymore.<br><br>And thing is, this had been done for centuries. For example many buildings have a Mish mash of styles because over the centuries things were added, renovated, and so on. This is as old a practice as architecture is. In my own city we have a city hall partially built in gothic style and partially built in renaissance. Because by the time they got to that renaissance wing, the style and fashion had changed. The cathedral is gothic, but it&#39;s interior is baroque because it was refurbished during the contra-reformation. There&#39;s a gothic style guild building with a 90s glass addition built right into it, and now it&#39;s modern office space. And so on, and so on. If notre dame had burnt down 200-300y ago, they would most probably have reconstructed it with a new &quot;modern&quot; baroque or classisist roof, or even would have completely renovated or rebuilt it in these new, then &quot;modern&quot; styles.<br><br>Even if some changes are made to Notre dame, it will probably be done with lots of respect and care, and it too will probably allow the cathedral to survive another couple of centuries.

YouTube used to be more about people uploading what interested them, and since then it has morphed into a massive advertisement platform. Every video is essentially puppeted by YouTube&#39;s algorithms to sell advertising space by sneakily influencing content creators to do what they want to do without saying it outright. Ever wonder why so many content creators make videos on the same subjects around the same time? Ever wonder why the sponsors for videos are always the same? Ever wonder why videos have gotten longer while the actual content in each video isn&#39;t any greater? I&#39;ve noticed that even small things like the word choices and tone used on each video is very specific these days, and every content creator sounds the same.

I also find many creators doing exactly as you say, loosing their voice by one, allowing too many influences to influence their channel, that is, trying to make it perfect, hiding mistakes and cutting out (often crudely) flubs etc, and that becomes annoying when it&#39;s multiple jump cuts in a row. <br><br>Too many creators are also &quot;influencers&quot;, what exactly does that mean?  I sometimes wonder if some creators are taking that too literally and perhaps a bit too far. Also, many may be finding that trying to cram too many subjects into a 10 minute video regardless whether it should be longer or not and I find that tiresome and rather frenetic, and others don&#39;t even bother to edit, much if at all, and thus lots of shots from afar that drone on for minutes before the move the camera in closer. My videos are varied in that they can be as short as 10 minutes or up to an hour or a bit more and on average I run roughly 30 minutes long now. I also edit, but when I need to jump forward, I often will utilize a cross dissolve, to lessen the jerkiness of jump cuts. I also find too many creators are struggling to find their voice, by trying to copy others, thus too many similar content from many channels. Some stand out from the sea of similar channels by being original in their presentation and how they go about it, others come off as too me too! Part of why I don&#39;t just subscribe wantonly to just any channel, usually.<br><br>But finding that voice means, be yourself, don&#39;t try to be something you are not is key here to how some channels are successful, or not, and it&#39;s not all that easy to find that voice, so some &quot;throw it at the wall and see what sticks&quot; is necessary at the beginning, but I find if you just be you, the likely you&#39;ll succeed.<br><br>BTW, the shortest video was shot in Oct, and was just over 2 minutes, 2 minutes and 15 seconds and it was a gorgeous sunrise one morning, then the next day, it was foggy. Showed that, and it&#39;s just a regular upload, no official shorts clip, but I find that on occasion, it can be not a bad thing if the subject warrants it, otherwise, I don&#39;t do click baits or any of that, as one, I find too many people dislike the click bait tactic, especially when it is treated as such.

They can cut corners enough to emaciate the business and really change the morale of those working for it.  It is easy for us all to follow the whims of what is the general concensus.  The notion that gets us to walk in step with one another while walking together also drives us to mould ourselves to public opinion.  No one likes to be ostracized, and so we tend to align ourselves with the worldview.  The social pressure mechanism that is causal in aligning the observed public opinion is very alike to the business thrift pressure mechanism.    I believe without a counterpressure to invest or expand the natural progression of the thrift will reduce a business to skeletal remains.  With some observation and contemplation I think one could see the same pattern when societies rise and fall.  The mechanism boiled down is evil, in regard to societies.

I can&#39;t do a video every day, and I&#39;m honestly not sure I could even keep up with a video a week, so the whole frequent new videos thing doesn&#39;t work for me.  The timing expectations are all over the place, with the algorithm typically preferring video lengths in exactly the wrong place for me.  I also doesn&#39;t help that some of my topics are fairly niche, so it&#39;s not like I could ever get enough views/subscribers to expect to get paid.  And the fact is, I&#39;m <i>unwilling</i> to try to fit myself to YouTube&#39;s expectations.

Maybe it is more akin to a glitch destroying your content. You have the footage to recreate old videos exactly the same or change them.

It just seems like tos is forever getting more strict,  and youtube is eventually going to force some people to change their content,  when that happens everyone loses. The creators aren&#39;t satisfied with their work, the fans aren&#39;t satisfied, and less people watch which has an effect on youtube. Maybe the answer is as simple as proving age, that way adults can watch adult content and children can&#39;t.

They actually represent a positive, if black background is used with correct frontal lighting, as they were used in the 19th century.<br> Also, a great idea to get to Paris and Notre Dame. Whatever they make of rebuld, that&#39;s an irrepeatable experience, both athmospherically historically. Being inside during the mass, it is more than just 3D audio or even video, if it were. Regret not getting to Paris before the fire, while i lived in France, but they got enough funds raised, to rebuild it several times over.<br><br><br> #2) Great there are additional stats about social platforms, confirming in part what i knew. Without confirmation bias, YT is last influential platform left not destroying the common user. It has died pretty bad though, at least in last 4-5 years. I propose a little contra-movement against the new policies, interfaces and the dumbing algorithm itself.<br> My plea is TO DISLIKE EVERY UPLOAD YOU CLICK UPON, letting content creator and everyone know why you did it in the comments. You can do it without commenting, it&#39;s just a way to communicate to creator, in case they are small and have a low viewcount and other people take up this challenge. So here Destin, i dislike your upload and probably all the rest of them, even though i like it. Think it&#39;s great and important job you do. <br><br> One of the main feature the rest of the social platforms lacked, was like/dislike/view ratio. It does not matter for algorithm, as they both count equally as engagement, so you wouldn&#39;t do harm to creators you love. Even if you don&#39;t know how to read it, still an important principle. Now it&#39;s hidden, somewhere deep in creator&#39;s stats.<br> So, why not let the YT know, that even their products, sorry, users still have a voice in how this place is run. Even if it is by the greedy Alphabet, disrespecting both their workers (content creators) and users. You know who you are. And stop watching shorts, ffs!<br> For a stronger protest, download the Brave browser, and YT won&#39;t get a penny more in ad revenue from you, because you won&#39;t see any, not a second.

No, don&#39;t do it, Destin!  You&#39;re a dad now, and dads never look good in shorts!<br><br>Seriously, though, one of the things I&#39;ve come to love about your videos is that you explain, in easily relatable terms, how things work.  It&#39;s obvious that your engineering background drives you to look at things in that way, but what really clinches the views for me is your ability to make things clear.<br><br>That said, there&#39;s a lot to say about the human connection.  As a sociologist, I gravitate toward social constructionism.  The Cathedral of Notre Dame wouldn&#39;t exist if Christianity hadn&#39;t been socially constructed in a peculiar way when the builders originally started their tasks.  This cathedral is the physical manifestation of a particular mutually constructed social reality in a particular place at a particular time.  <br><br>But as a futurist, I gravitate toward social constructions and how they change over time.  The agony so many people felt watching images of a magnificent building burning shows how much of the meaning we make of life today -- and which we project into the futures we create -- is anchored in our shared pasts.  Those shared pasts may be real or imagined, but the fact that we share images of a common past anchors us in time.<br><br>I have my doubts that the cathedral will be restored exactly as it was.  Not only are there changes to the materials and techniques we have available, but there are social changes as well.  And the builders, church officials, and the people who worship there all, no doubt, have their ideas of how it ought to be.  Whatever they do, however, will last far into the future.  So, to me, the biggest question is: what do they want this monument -- this living representation of what Catholicism is and should be -- this living monument of Paris and Parisian life -- is and should be, both for people living today and those who will celebrate nine centuries of life after the fire.<br><br>Voices change over time.

But in spite of my personal agreement with the general point of your video, I think that there are several illustrating examples you chose that are in fact off-the-point, and the Notre-Dame issue is one of them. Let me elaborate.<br><br>It is true that there has been an outbreak of indignation in France (and elsewhere) at the mere idea of changing a single thing to the architecture of Notre-Dame after the fire. I understand where this feeling comes from, and it comes out of a good place: preserving the voice of the past as it was. Now, the trouble is: that voice, as we perceive it, NEVER really exited. We see Notre-Dame as this timeless piece of architecture that bridges a nearly 1000-years gap between people who shared the same human nature as we do. But no more than anything that we human build, be it physical objects or concepts, Notre-Dame is not timeless and cannot be.<br>       First, a you said yourself, the cathedral was built over a 200+-year period. This is ample time for architectural tastes and theological and practical priorities to change. But more than that, ALL European cathedrals have been undergoing constant refurbishing and repurposing throughout the hundreds and hundreds of years of History they went through. In the case of Notre-Dame, the largest changes that were made emanated from the so-called Romantic period of the middle of the XIXth century, where a renewed interest for the Middle-Ages appeared. Therefore, the Notre-Dame that we know and love is, really, not a testimony of the architectural taste of the XIth century in France, but a testimony of the way people from XIXth-century France IMAGINED the Middle Ages to be.<br><br>So, the question is: with a building that has spanned a thousand years, and whose very structure bears the mark of the varying tastes of people during that time span, which version should be the &quot;true&quot; one ? Were do you put the cursor ? In that way, ancient buildings are a little like languages: they both bear traces of an ancient, almost timeless past, and at the same time are constantly evolving through their everyday use and the changes of taste of the successive time periods.<br><br>It is important to keep snapshots of things as they are, as a memory (and now that we can do that). But willing to &quot;freeze&quot; things in time as a testimony of the past is doomed to fail.

The issue of maintaining one&#39;s voice gets into a topic on what is the minimum data required to transmit YOUR message. I have just started a channel and like you see my video length as that required to say what I intend to say. Each video could be longer or shorter; the direction would depend on the audience that one is trying to reach and on the level of detail being presented. I have always been a fan of your video length because it allows sufficient time to dig into a topic. Shorter would mean less detail or require the audience to have a greater understanding of particular concepts. All of this of course hinges on what one considers a successful creation. 100 views or 100k ? The more views one chases it would seem there is an inherent need to modify the message, but this may not necessarily mean losing your voice or message. You do you.

I don&#39;t know what glass bubble you&#39;ve been living in, but everyone&#39;s journey is going to be determined by circumstance and free will, in that order. For example, it is pure circumstance that all your best friends were even born (much more likely, a different person would have been born), but then you made the best of the situation you were in by choosing the best friends you could out of who was available. And this is not a bad thing, because ours brain can&#39;t cope with infinite possibilities.<br>Second, making the content you want to make and making the content that performs well is not an either-or, even if from your perspective it often seems that way, because you are in control of what you want to a greater extent than you may realize. What I mean is, if things like length of your videos are really essential to what you want to make, then (my hot take is) you simply aren&#39;t innovating enough. There is no first principles reason why you can&#39;t tell the story you want to tell in a way that happens to please the algorithm. Short form and long form content serve different but viable roles on YouTube nowadays, and I can&#39;t help but feel like you either 1) haven&#39;t clearly identified what actually matters (like you obviously feel it, but can&#39;t write it down in a sentence), or 2) haven&#39;t accepted that the platform has changed, that demographics have changed, etc.<br>Third, I highly doubt that even if you ignore the algorithm entirely when you make the video, you wouldn&#39;t still be influenced by it indirectly. Because the community who watches must go through that algorithm, and their feedback get you to change the next video. And dude, if you won&#39;t listen to feedback from anywhere, then I mean, that&#39;s not protecting your voice, that&#39;s just talking to yourself.<br>Anyway, rant ending with this: Knowing who you are is not about controlling or ignoring external factors. Those external factors turn into opportunity, skill, and character with the right mindset. Knowing who you are is about identifying your values, and using that to set a destination (a firm goal with only the most important stipulations) or trajectory (an algorithm that you filter your actions through) for your life. Once you have your destination or algorithm, accept that most things in life are out of your control, and just course correct on the way. Knowing what you want is only possible if you know yourself really well, so focus on figuring out who you are before making sweeping changes to your projects.<br>Hope this helps someone.

Especially now that it&#39;s many people&#39;s livelihood rather than just an art project.

They can identify things like propaganda, science denial, and scams to some degree, and create a subset of your recommendations that is outside of what you normally watch. Maybe 1 in 50 recommendations is something from a political bubble outside the one you create for yourself, or 1 in 30 is something from a genre you haven&#39;t watched before (but also haven&#39;t told it to avoid). &quot;Popular&quot; has a place in the recommendations, but it can also include expanding our horizons or getting outside of our comfort zone a little.<br><br>On the other side of that, though, the BULK of recommendations should be based on what you&#39;ve actually watched and what you&#39;ve said not to show. As many channels as I&#39;ve clicked &quot;never recommend&quot;, I should never see a sports or major pseudonews punditry network (CNN, Fox, etc.) recommendation ever again, but they never go away.

In fact, there&#39;s one YouTuber I watch who refuses to shoot portrait, but still occasionally uploads short videos, and I think they&#39;re better than shorts because they&#39;re not constrained to the format and length.

I think it could come down to implementation, but I definitely consume both types of content (the &quot;shorts&quot; I consume mostly come via reddit) and so I can understand how the conclusion was made. That said, when I come to youtube, I come to watch 15min plus videos, either to learn something, or to entertain myself during a meal. I think youtube also wants me to come here when I am bored and wasting time (instead of reddit), and sees shorts as that path.<br><br>I am not a content creator so I definitely don&#39;t have the same perspective as you, and although I can see the theory, the implementation hasn&#39;t hit me yet.", "comment_date": "2021-12-02T03:34:50Z", "likes_count": 7}, {"comment_by": "John Shanks", "comment_text": "Some videos are far to long and could be shorter and . to the point a bit more.", "comment_date": "2021-12-02T03:34:29Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Daniel Jordan", "comment_text": "Isn\u2019t the current human moment and voice captured here in the comments of YouTube?

Furthermore, Notre Dame has been renovated before.  During WWII some of the stained glass windows were damaged and replaced with more modern designs.  The pipe organ was replaced with a computerized system.  One of the spires was added in the 19th century.  One of the things that makes Notre Dame interesting is that it embodies the history of France because it has evolved continuously for almost 1000 years.  The current renovations are just one more evolution of something that&#39;s been around for a long time.  Part of being old is that you endure tragedy.  You grow, you change, you evolve.

The longer the video is, The more time I can be immersed into something that I can learn about. that&#39;s so very interesting! even though it may not be interesting, this channel makes something that could be not interesting to me and make it absolutely mind-blowing for me. I love you, your channel, your mind of creation, You have the absolute power to change the world and you are doing it by every video that you produce.

Anyway, I wanted to share something I use in my modern world history classes. At a previous institution I had a student approach me after teaching a class on WWI. She commented that her mother flipped houses and found an old photo album in an attic in upstate New York. It turns out was an album an American brought back from the war. I can imagine him showing it to his family as he tried to explain his experiences. It starts off with the trip over, then the basics of the battlefields, but it progressively gets worse as he experiences the horrors of the war. I can imagine the shock of his family as they see the descent. The cool thing is that it is unfiltered and un moderated. There is no commentary and very few descriptions. I was able to scan the album, covers and all, and now I use it in class to have the students try to understand the experiences of the soldier. I want them to be as close to that soldier&#39;s voice as possible without the modern explanations or expectations. I think that&#39;s what you&#39;re advocating here, and although it is difficult, messy, and sometimes takes more time than we want, the act of really thinking and staying true to our own voice is incredibly important.

Don&#39;t ever lose your message.  I might not agree with it, but I do enjoy your content, especially when it comes to science.  Also, your memories and the message you are trying to convey are important.  Some of my favorites where where you got your children and your father involved.

While I don&#39;t consider myself an expert by any means, part of my hobby is taking pictures in existing light with no flash.  My current camera is a Cannon Rebel XT digital SLR.  That being said, if you learn the abilities and limitations of even a cell phone, you can get stunning pictures from those as well.  I loaned a Fujifilm point and click digital camera to a friend of mine who was going on a trip to Niagara Falls. I advised him to never use the flash.  He did not listen and turned on the flash.  Most of his nighttime pictures failed because of that.  What I told him was no matter how it looked in the display on the camera, I could do post processing to bring out the detail, but only if he did not use the flash.  This is what I mean by knowing the limitations.<br><br>@ <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZVaUoyabjAg&amp;t=12m33s\">12:33</a> These photos are a fun side by side for me.

Files and digital data can be changed, edited, deleted. The way we perceive our now non-physical posessions as corruptible is very interesting. <br><br>Regarding Youtube culture; <br>change is a natural part of life. As technology, society and our surroundings change, so will the platforms we use. <br><br>Youtube has two choices; it could stay still and inevitably become less relevant, or change and hope to stay on top. So the only logical business move is to adapt. And, on a smaller scale, the same rules apply to its creators. Everything has a life cycle, a high-point in its career, a Kondratiev curve. So it&#39;s either go with the flow or lose momentum.<br><br>That being said; even if this or any other current creator will eventually not be as relevant as competing channels, that doesn&#39;t mean they&#39;re worth less to their individual consumers for it. Quality does not always equal quantity. There&#39;s enough place for everyone on this site, and you only have to change if your end goal is continuous growth. If your end goal is to create things/videos you (and by proxy your viewers) can deem valuable, you can take pride in your actual product instead of needing to find comfort in your ever-growing numbers, which is, ultimately, a much healthier outlook on life.<br><br>Youtube as a company has no choice; to support itself and pay its employees, it must change to stay relevant. Don&#39;t get me wrong; I hate shorts, I think it&#39;s a waste of time and things like deleting the dislike button is definitely not the change I want to see on this platform. <br><br>Still, Youtube must and will change over time like it has over the last 16 years. But we as people - you, as creators - do have that choice. If you have the financial freedom to not worry too much about growth anymore, you can always decide for yourself. <br><br>So in conclusion - being willing to change is good, but staying true to oneself is just as great. <br><br>Keep up the good work, Destin, you&#39;re awesome.", "comment_date": "2021-12-01T21:06:02Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Glen Subtorq", "comment_text": "Man that is a great conversation you have with this video!

After your film video, I got back into shooting analog film, I started off with finishing a roll that had been loaded in my soviet era SLR camera for a few years and then before I knew it I got two more film SLR cameras (EOS 650 and EOS 500 &quot;Kiss&quot;), a lens I absolutely adore (28mm - 105mm 3.5/4.5f USM), a bulk loader full b/w film (Ilfords HP5+) and a negative folder full of memories. I think just this year I&#39;ve processed myself over 20 rolls of film including both black and white and colour.<br><br>To this day it&#39;s still magical when I process the film (or get it processed) and rediscover moments/memories that I had forgotten.<br><br>Now time for me to give back :) <br><br>Those glass plates are most likely known as &quot;wet plate photography&quot;, basically it was how they did photos back in the day before celluiod and acetal film became mainstream.  Here is something to blow your mind, when a photographer went to do wet plate photography, it was quite the ordeal, they had to take the photo, while the plate was still wet!.

Of course, I don&#39;t have insight in every of your work decisions, but for me, you seem to have your voice. Regarding my question, using the example of Notre Dame... What do you think about the idea, that changes can be used to extend the meaning and purpose of ones voice? Like, I can imagine, that there is a way to change Notre Dame in a way that it brings its history, meaning and monumentality (if that&#39;s a word) closer to the people just like science brings the beauty of nature closer to me, by getting a closer look, a look from a different direction or becoming embedded in a bigger story. Also, some of the greatest moments that I have experienced in my personal life come from updating my mind and my voice, at least to some extend, whereas I could watch former friends declining by not updating their voice and fading to insignificance in an ever changing world. Of course, all of that can also be executed in the wrong way, in changing something to what it never was. But it can also be changed to something more conceivable, I think... Is there a boundary that can be named for where to stick and where to update ones voice, I wonder...

Referring to the beginning - keeping one&#39;s voice, it reminded me of some videos by a philosophy channel entitled carefree wandering, addressing existence and profile and authenticity.  I find that some channels that I have watched previously I am falling away from as they strive to feed the algorithm. It does affect their voice and their content though I think it must be too subtle for others to note.  Youtube is the only social type medium that I continue to use.  I avoid anything clickbatey.  Some channels I like have begun to do clickbate styled thumbnails and titles and I find it repulsive.  <br>I do not think it weird to collect other peoples negatives and such.

There are functioning homes in places like Norway that were built 100s of years ago, the oldest is a museum and work space housing the work of a brilliant woman known as the sweater detective, built in the 1650s.   But here, especially where I&#39;m stuck, it literally changes by the week and there are very few older trees as every ten years or so areas are torn down, including the trees &amp; greenery planted with the last development, as if trees are only inanimate objects rather than a part of a complex system providing an environment for other parts of this system, and all new is put in.

If you do not care if the video makes any money you can do whatever  whenever you want.

Youtube is also politically biased and pushes a narrative and tries to control what it deems as &quot;fact&quot;.<br>Using the ability to ban or limit income from providers is how they enforce their idea of what is &quot;fact&quot; or what you can show and discuss.  The people incharge of Youtube are not really interested in  &quot;quality&quot; in the content.  Their interest is income and pushing a political bias. You can post a video equal in &quot;artistic quality&quot; of priceless artwork in museums and if it gets little views and someone else posts silly nonsense cat pranks with more views Youtube will go after the money and push the video that makes them the most money.

There&#39;s SO much to unpack and think about here. In the same way that we each have our own voice, we also each have our own perspectives when listening to another&#39;s voice. In my case, that perspective is this: <br>I have studied both the history of image-making (primarily cinema, but also still photography) AND the history of architecture. So I was wearing both of those hats--or both of those pairs of ears, if you prefer--as I was watching and listening. <br>There IS something utterly fascinating about what&#39;s called &quot;found footage&quot; in the cinema world--or &quot;found images&quot; in the case of the slides and plates you have acquired. They are physical artifacts. They are the images ON those artifacts. And they are also, as you delve into, memory. There is a very large body of research and thinking about images and memory. I could go on for ages, but I&#39;ll just leave it at that.<br>Something I&#39;d like to explore a bit more is the history of Notre Dame. As you say, it was built over a very long period of time. In a way, it&#39;s possible to argue that it has been under CONTINUOUS construction, renovation, and change ever since the cornerstone was laid in 1163. The building is almost 1,000 years old. It&#39;s very tempting for us to think of it as &quot;permanent&quot;, &quot;fixed&quot;, or &quot;immutable&quot;, but nothing could be further from the truth. It has changed countless times. It&#39;s just that those changes (typically) happen over such long periods of time that they become almost invisible to us. Sudden, drastic changes, like the fire, are of course different. During the French Revolution, it was gutted, used as a warehouse, and fell into almost ruin. It came very close to disappearing. Victor Hugo&#39;s &quot;The Hunchback of Notre-Dame&quot; (just &quot;Notre-Dame de Paris&quot; in French) was written as a desperate plea to save it--and it worked. The &quot;restoration&quot; made MAJOR changes--most famously, the spire by Viollet-le-Duc. At the time, it was HUGELY controversial. But it became one of the great symbols. It was, of course, the collapse of the spire which was the most shocking aspect of the 2019 fire...even though the spire was in no way &quot;original&quot;! So the history of buildings in general, and this building in particular, is complicated.<br>As far as &quot;reconstruction&quot; or &quot;restoration&quot; is concerned, it&#39;s once again complicated and controversial. There was an architectural design competition. Some of the proposals were radically different--just as Viollet-le-Duc&#39;s had been in the 19th century. It got very controversial. A bill was introduced requiring it to reproduce the Viollet-le-Duc design, and that&#39;s what is now planned. Personally, I think that missed an opportunity to add yet another new chapter to the ongoing and living history of the building, but the replica argument won the day. Perhaps the open question is this: is a replica the &quot;same&quot; as the original? How does it affect the voice of the building? How does it affect the collective memory?<br><br>As far as YOUR voice is concerned, I love how thoughtful and reflective this video is! I also love the long(er)-form stuff you and others do. I completely agree with your argument for longer, deeper stuff. There are plenty of platforms for short-form clips. YouTube HAS TO recognize that longer-form stuff is a differentiator. If it becomes just another platform for shorts, that would be a very unwise business decision, IMO.

It is a good video, I&#39;m not sayng that! It does bring quality content... As matter of fact it has convinced me (a person who doesn&#39;t comment much at all) to write all of this in a comment. I just want to say that I&#39;d rather prefer to whach a 6-15 min. long video that is full of the important stuff and informations, (I think it is possible to explain a lot of things in 15 minutes), than a video that you have to &quot;ear&quot; in the background while you do other things because is almost half an hour long. The attention trehshold is at most 10 minutes straight every hour... And unfortunately I&#39;ve notice this trend in almost all the channels I&#39;m subscribed to... This puts a lot of stress on my willness to see everithing new that my favourite youtubers publish... I feel that sometimes it would take 4 or 5 hours a day to cover everithing you guys publish...

Sure your content would never work on a platform like TikTok, YouTube isn&#39;t looking to become TikTok.  Shorts aren&#39;t meant to replace the longform video content, rather to supplement it.  And while a channel could exist on youtube that is nothing but shorts, in the spirit and style of TikTok, to dismiss them outright because the majority of content on platforms like that tend to be more mindless, dumb entertainment is maybe a bit short sighted.<br><br>Right now, you cover a wide range of topics, and the 10 million of us subscribed to your channel love it.  But what about all of the other users who may see a 30 minute long video about visiting the coast guard, or diving deep into how a carburetor works and think &quot;nah, not interested&quot;.  There could be people skipping right past a topic that could become their passion purely because they don&#39;t want to spend 20, 30, 40 minutes or more to &quot;get to the point&quot;.  Whereas, a 60 second video that condenses the idea down to its most basic concept in a way that makes it intriguing just might get them interested enough in the topic to put in that 20, 30 or 40 minutes to learn more.<br><br>Don&#39;t fall into the trap of seeing &quot;the medium is the message&quot;.  The best artists and creators have always been those who are able to work within the limits of a medium without letting the medium define their message.  Already there are people on TikTok tackling complex ideas in shortform videos in ways that intrigue and inspire more learning.  Just look at the whole wellerman hype that happened last year.  Adam Neely was able to take it and create an entire video that dove deep into the topic and history of Sea Shanties and within that very video he had examples of people on TikTok exploring interesting musical ideas.<br><br>I&#39;m not trying to say you should do shorts.  You do what you want to do, it&#39;s worked well enough to get 10 million people to subscribe.  What I am saying, however, is that maybe you could revisit the idea of what a short is without assuming that TikTok is the end all, be all of what that medium is capable of being, and maybe you&#39;ll see a challenge in it to make the short something more meaningful, instead of just letting it continue to be mindless, dumb entertainment.", "comment_date": "2021-12-01T18:27:39Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "jinkiescoob", "comment_text": "If I could give this 1000 likes I would.

The obvious reaction to this catastrophe was devastation and pain as it has always been part of the reality I lived in for the past 27 years.

Change is not always bad.   Change, in fact, is necessary even as we pine for what we know better.   Humans are resistant to change, but it is often inevitable.  I mean, you can go back to the horse and buggy and steamship if you want, but then you couldn\u2019t have even traversed the airport in Paris, right?    Similarly; I no longer shoot film and am not enthralled with glass negatives - but I can appreciate the images captured.   That, to me, is what is important - that the moment was captured.  Or, alternatively, that you get to Paris in the first place.  If you can do so more conveniently, all the better.  <br>2.  Some change is - in my opinion - bad.   Take Dublin Castle, which has the gorgeous architecture seen in the Cathedral here but also has additions made in what appears to be 1950\u2019s brickwork.    That changes the character of it substantially and - frankly - turned me off of the whole thing.   I went there to photograph it and didn\u2019t bother.   Likewise, if they introduced modern graves into Pere\u2019 Le\u2019chaise Cemetery in Paris, it would alter the character of it materially.  <br>3.  Having been to the Notre Dame Cathedral shortly before it burned, I can say that unless they substantially alter the character, it doesn\u2019t matter all that much what they do.   After all, the stone didn\u2019t burn.  Some things are (relatively) permanent.  <br>4.  I subscribe to YouTube content creators because of the content.  Have I found every one of them that I think is valuable?  Assuredly not, thanks to the algorithm.  But I find them.   And once I have, the quality of the content is what keeps me coming back.   I don\u2019t listen to podcasts because 99% of them have way too much fluff in them and take forever to get down to the topic at hand.    One thing I <b>AM</b> tired of is in-content \u201csponsored by\u201d ads - those are a guaranteed skip or close-out of the video if they are at the end.    I get why they are there, but hey, I am paying for YT Premuim to avoid ads, only to get them in the content I am paying to watch.  <br>.", "comment_date": "2021-12-01T16:43:43Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Kieran Beswick", "comment_text": "Dustin.

But I do have to keep in mind something in addition. When trying to preserve a cultural heritage or a national tradition we have to start thinking in the way if changes thoughout the years. One incredibly huge examples is The Bible, what now 2.4 billion people perseves as something sacred changed drastically. The first univercal council in Nikea actually in 325 AD actually changes the bible in inverercible ways, they remove the chapter on reincarnation for example, something that previously for more than 300 years was regarded in the same way as the sun rising up from the east. So my question is why we should rebuild the chirch in absolutely the same way when even before the burn it wasnt the same as 700 years ago. It is a very interesting dilema, I also want them to rebuild it in the same way in order to preserve it but then again why not change it to reflect our lifes in the present so the future can learn from us?

People are going to come and go. Just like I may come and go at some point. There are many channels where I longer watch them because they got stale. So if you change with the times then you will keep growing. If your baseball videos gets the most views then stick with things like that. If this video gets low views then do not do it again. I am going to guess this video will get low views. <br>You also have to rememebr that 10 years ago was the days when videos got 10s of millions of views. This was because there were far less channels at that time. Now there are 10s of thousands of channels who have 1m subs or more. This gives a lot more content for people to watch. Viewership has gone down for channels yet overall its much higher because its spread out. <br>Your channel for example has been around for a decade and in the last 5 years has seen a drastic drop in viewership. Many of your major viewed videos were 5 years or more a go with a few recent videos here and there. This is true with 1000s of channels you will find people who are still producing the same content that now garners under one million views where they used to get 10s of millions of views. This is because there are more and greater options of channels out there.

I\u2019d bet the practicing Catholics would like a space that isn\u2019t overrun with tourists, so unless they are going to limit entry entirely, it make sense to accommodate both uses of the space. Also, it certainly hasn\u2019t always been the tourist destination it is today - that\u2019s why Victor Hugo wrote his novel to begin with - it itself is propaganda. As for your own videos, (which I enjoy, btw), who is your audience, really? If this was really about what you personally like and want, would you care about anything you tube does? And to that end, why then produce videos at all that are the teaching/conversation to an audience? If, though, you are interested in reaching a wide number of people, you have to bow to the pressures of how that is made possible. For instance, you could be releasing all your videos in Latin, but that for sure would shrink your audience. Don\u2019t want to do shorts? Don\u2019t do shorts.

I really do not think you need to lower yourself just to keep YouTube happy. Some may like them, but I really find them annoying. I used to come in from work, grab a cup of tea, then look at my subscriptions page on YouTube to see what new videos had been released from my favourite channels. Not so long ago i could simply click on any one of those videos and I would be taken straight to an enjoyable video. Nowadays so much of the stuff on my subs page is either shorts, or scheduled video release notifications. Whereas before I simply clicked on a video from a favourite channel without thinking about it, now i have to scrutinise it a bit to see if it&#39;s just a short, or even worse a scheduled release notification. And sadly to say, quite a few of channels i subscribe to now are spending more and more time into making shorts. Obviously it is their channel, and they rightly get to decide what they release, but for me, I am now finding myself subconsciously skipping past videos from the creators that have been making lots of shorts.<br><br>With regards to Notre Dame, I do hope they resist the temptation to change too much. Walking into old places like that it is often like being taken back in time, the dark lighting, the sound, the whole atmosphere of the place really hits your senses.

Such rare places should be stuck in time, so that we, and future generations get to experience it like it was.

As a Catholic Priest who is also a geek, I do think you&#39;re hitting on something with your Notre Dame analogy. When Notre Dame burned, it impacted me on two levels: One - I visited the Cathedral when I was in high school; Two - It&#39;s obviously important for the history of Christianity. When the announcement was made about making it more tourist friendly, it hit me in a weird way too. Do I want people to visit the beauty of Notre Dame? Yes! Do I want it to maintain its faith identify? Yes! There&#39;s also the tension that the life of a Christian is a lived relationship with Jesus Christ amid the community faith - Community first, buildings second. At the same time, there is something about sacred places like Notre Dame that do facilitate a faith experience. My hope is that the &quot;tourist friendly&quot; will be done in a way that will protect the integrity of the faith aspect of Notre Dame while allowing visitors who are wanting to see it more for non-faith reasons to have a positive experience, but not at the cost of faith. All things need to modernize - upgraded HVAC systems, security, restoration, replacement of crumbling walls, etc. But the identity or ethos of the space needs to remain consistent.<br><br>In regard to social media, I agree that keeping your voice like keeping the faith dimension of Notre Dame is important. Something I struggle with is when it becomes clear that social media as an entity itself has a &quot;voice&quot; or &quot;bias&quot; toward the controversial, inflammatory, and violent. As much as I love YouTube for things like your channel, it also worries me that social media has the ability to say to authentic voices &quot;your voice will not be heard.&quot; I agree with you - Don&#39;t change your approach to content unless it reflects an authentic change in you.

I see the way they manipulate us into knowing less and less about something.

You don&#39;t absorb anything. This is the same as all Network news channels do today, by showing snippets on a subject they show the point side and eliminate the counterpoint side so that people who don&#39;t know to dig further assume that is all there is to know, and immediately their thought process is manipulated. Also when they started doing this I transmit from my phone to my television and if you click on the short it tells you that you have to disengage transmitting to your TV, which is a sneaky way to get you to disengage the complete information of a longer program into snippets which are, mainly when it goes to news subjects are all from the main Street Media mainly NBC, abc, and so on.  This is pure blatant manipulation of the mind by Google. And I hope that I am not the only one who has noticed this and if others have noticed please tell your children what is the reasoning behind them having these snippets and what the big corporations are trying to do to their thinking. We are under assault by communist teachings from every corner that we go around these days and they will never stop until enough people are growing up with enough thought manipulation that all of  the things that should have been taught to them have been overridden by manipulative communistic thinking.

Yes, keep your voice, yes, keep your focus, but Notre Dame is changing to be able to change with the times. The cathedral&#39;s purpose isn&#39;t the same as it used to be, there&#39;re more and more cathedrals and churches all over the place and more and more denominations that have their own voice as well, so Notre Dame is better served by the need to be kept upright through tourism dollars. The longer a thing exists, the more money it costs to make sure it KEEPS existing, and Notre Dame, like so many other places, has been around for so long that it&#39;s basically lost any sense of possibility of being modernized, whether that be for handling a group of people in the space or for handling things like accessibility concerns, which is a very real problem in a lot of older construction, narrower doorways and passages, steps and such with no wheelchair access, the list goes on. The church isn&#39;t really losing its voice by saying &quot;We&#39;re going to make the building more accessible&quot;, they still exist as a massive cathedral and such, but they also know that they have, in this moment, and opportunity to make necessary changes that wouldn&#39;t have been possible before because they would be potentially destructive, an opportunity presented by the fact that random chance basically made those destructive changes FOR them. It&#39;s still gonna be a giant cathedral, it&#39;s still gonna have all of its majesty and everything else, but this way it can serve those who were underserved in the past, all while maintaining that voice.<br><br>In essence, to make the comparison work, it&#39;d be like if you were working with a renderer for your videos that worked in extremely proprietary project files, but it was the best there was at the time you got it for your needs. Then, you had a major software crash that made that older piece of rendering software fail completely in a way that couldn&#39;t be fixed, not only making your older files impossible to work with, but also forcing you to change it. Now you could get the latest version of that same software, which would still be just as unable to do anything with your older files for whatever reason, or you could change it to software that works even better for your needs in the moment, which, again, would have trouble using older files, but would give you additional features like easier captioning, et cetera. Either way, the loss has already taken place, and there&#39;s nothing you can really do about the fact that the loss happened, you&#39;re just left with either going back to exactly how things were and how they worked for you way back when, or taking the opportunity to make necessary changes that would make your life, and the lives of some of your viewers, better in the process.", "comment_date": "2021-12-01T15:39:34Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Mr Outcast", "comment_text": "wait wait - so you&#39;re keep mentioning algorithm..

Buildings need to reflect their current usage, they charge to reflect their current use. Where as shorts is just a weird experiment by YouTube to get more visitors based on other apps around it, it&#39;s not helpful to the website. Notre-Dame is changing to reflect it&#39;s current usage, but YouTube is changing to gain usage that may well reduce its usefulness and in turn its use.<br><br>If we left every building the same for ever we&#39;d still be living in cold, dark, energy inefficient homes. Buildings need to reflect their current usage to some extent. That doesn&#39;t mean they have to lose their history. Making them safer and more useful to the current users is not a bad thing, especially when the current building is damaged. If we were to follow the &quot;don&#39;t change the history&quot; mentality, we should leave Notre-Dame as a burnt out shell, because that is it&#39;s history, that is what happened to it. Simply by rebuilding it we are altering it as a building, so why not build it back better for it&#39;s current users. For example, they can replace burnt wooden structures with treated wood that has embedded fire retardant in it. Visually it&#39;ll look the same as it did before, but from a safety point of view it&#39;ll stop the building burning down again. Equally you can use the rebuilding process to integrate accessibility to wheelchair or make it safer for crowds to manoeuvre within the space. <br><br>All historical buildings have changes made to them over time. Visit any castle or palace and they&#39;ll be a model or image explaining how they grew or changed over time, with some kind of indicators telling use how they grew and when it happened.<br><br>The changes to Notre-Dame will be sympathetic to the building, they have to be. And as soon as they are made they will become a part of its history and development to reflect the changing use of the space. To reflect the current voice of the space. Just as the fire has become part of the history of the space.<br><br>Humanity doesn&#39;t stand still in the past. We remember it, but we don&#39;t live in it.

That does not mean it lost it&#39;s meaning, though. It just navigated through time, being affected by it in different ways, good, bad or neither one.<br>In medieval times, the facade of Notre Dame was painted. We are used to think of this naked stone as a sign of the old days classy style, but this is actually very wrong. Same thing for the sculptures of classical era Greece by the way. Recolored versions can be found, and they seem tacky to us, but that&#39;s just a cultural thing we project.<br>In the recent fire, a part called the Fl\u00e8che de Notre Dame (the arrow) fell. That&#39;s the part that triggered all the questionning on whether it should be rebuilt the same or not for a good reason : it was not in the original Notre Dame. It was added in the XIXth century when Viollet-Le-Duc - a very famous and impactful architect of that era - got in charge of restoring Notre Dame.<br><br>Viollet-Le-Duc was one the biggest history nerds of his time, by the way. If you want to visit Castles in France some day, visit 1 or 2 iconic ones, and then visit the one of Pierrefond. It was &quot;restored&quot; by Viollet-Le-Duc in a way that really shows how the Medieval Time was dreamt of in the XIXth century. Real fun stuff.<br><br>The fleche&#39;s addition is a part of Notre Dame history in the XIXth in the same way.<br>That&#39;s raising an interesting question. Should we really try not to impact our monuments nowadays ? We kinda lost the thing for building monuments packed with history details and made to be ever lasting. XXIth century should leave a mark too, in its way. Obviously we should not replace earlier stuff, but when we have opportunity to add nowadays stuff, it feels right, doesn&#39;t it ?<br><br>Our voices are affected by our time, no matter what. It&#39;s a good thing to be aware of it and question it, but I&#39;d argue some changes are to be accepted for the better.<br>To me shorts are the easy to click ad for channels I don&#39;t know or haven&#39;t watched in a long time.

I think many of us forget that history never stops being made. The Notre Dame (or any historical structure that serves as a utility of some kind) isn\u2019t a finished work in the same sense a painting like the Mona Lisa is, it\u2019s a constantly evolving system that is added to over time. I\u2019m not saying that it should be razed down or converted to a car park but I do think that updating it to serve the same purpose as before, but more suitably to modern needs is perfectly fine. <br>For example, replacing the chairs, adding new artwork, modern heating system, remodelling for greater seating capacity etc. In fact I\u2019d guess that in 900 years time, there will be people arguing that the building should be preserved including the stuff added today because to them it\u2019s 900 years old.", "comment_date": "2021-12-01T14:46:39Z", "likes_count": 9}, {"comment_by": "THE PUBLIC EYE", "comment_text": "As a viewer I don&#39;t want to lose who I am either.", "comment_date": "2021-12-01T14:46:30Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Buckeye Backyard BBQ", "comment_text": "It\u2019s weird how my videos I think that will not do well get the most views!!", "comment_date": "2021-12-01T14:46:28Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "MrSorbias", "comment_text": "Thank you for not going into the shorts train.<br>I&#39;ve had exactly the same thoughts. <br><br>I used to watch shorts, but when I figured what it&#39;s all about, I basically stopped watching those completely and for me they&#39;re not a thing anymore.", "comment_date": "2021-12-01T14:46:22Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Marc Denlinger", "comment_text": "A great message.

It&#39;s natural actually for a person to have multiple voices, the different voices we use for our different audiences.
