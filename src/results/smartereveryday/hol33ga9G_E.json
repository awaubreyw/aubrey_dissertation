A cancer with 100% death rate isn&#39;t a surprise, without modern medicine this would be commonplace. A contagious cancer is staggering, absolutely incredible. If I took a cancer cell from one patient and put it in another patient&#39;s body, the second patient would almost certainly kill that cancer because their immune system would recognise it as foreign. Cancer cells are modified versions of your own cells, unique to the individual. Just like if patient 1 donates a kidney to patient 2 the immune system of patient 2 will attack the donated tissue, it should also attack a cancer donated by patient 1. This is due to a group of proteins called the major histocompatibility complex, which help trigger the immune system&#39;s attack on foreign cells (or your own cells infected by foreign material, eg viruses).<br><br>Humans have many proteins which are the same across the whole population, but the MHC is incredibly diverse. With the exception of identical twins, no two individuals have the same MHC combinations. Tassie Devils on the other hand have very few combinations, to the point where a tassie devil could probably have a kidney transplant without any anti-rejection drugs. They don&#39;t recognise the cells from another devil as foreign, so they don&#39;t recognise the tumour as foreign either.<br><br>Hope you don&#39;t mind me commenting, I learn so many things from all your videos, it&#39;s quietly pleasing to be able to pass some knowledge back.

Humans, meanwhile, have to basically kill off their immune systems in order to receive organs and the like.

Should we really try to save Tasmanian devils?  This species has obviously been marked by mother nature to be removed from this planet.

If you allow for saving these organisms, as a personal choice, you&#39;ve opened the door to altering ecosystems based on the rule that if you want to do it, it&#39;s perfectly OK.  Species go extinct all the time, with no help from us at all.  This is one of the highest profile examples.  <br>I feel the same way about those who fight forest fires that are not man made.  Fire is a natural process.  Some forests are in fact designed by mother nature to burn at fairly regular intervals.  When the process is stopped, the forest can not be renewed.  <br>Too many people expect the world to not change around them, when in fact change is inherent to the nature of this planet.

The immune system should easily detect the foreign cells. However, there are two reasons for this coming to my mind. Either, the immune system is somehow inhibited by the tumor cells, maybe they release immune suppressing cytokines or something. Or the genetic diversity of the devils is so small, that the immune system cannot distinguish the foreign cells from its own cells (That&#39;s the reason why humans cannot be infected. If human cancer cells somehow come into your body it doesn&#39;t matter since your immune system will easily eliminate the cells before they can grow). If the second possibility is correct, there have to be some devils, which cannot be infected due to a higher difference in their genetics.

Does the fact that the &#39;microorganism&#39; that causes the disease is so bizarre from our definition of one, that &#39;inmunity&#39; may be a concept that doesn&#39;t even apply here? Are they inbred to a certain degree in which no individual is different enough to be able to have the inmunity? Do they have no parasite that alters their behaviour in such a way that they don&#39;t wish to be bitten by a member of their species? (this actually wouldn&#39;t apply because, if l understood it correctly, the disease is way too recent) Too many questions, not enough answers.<br>See people, this is why scientists study cancer in Tasmanian devils, some uneducated people may be like &quot;How about you try to find a vaccine for <b>human</b> cancer!!!&quot; but these scientists, by researching this disease, managed to also help with the diagnosis of human schwannomas.
