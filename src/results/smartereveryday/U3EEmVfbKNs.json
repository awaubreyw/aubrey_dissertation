The privacy issue is that this information legally constitutes medical records - which is why you had to use a HIPAA warning as well. By US law, life insurance companies are entitled to a portion of that information, depending on individual state laws, and you have to provide it if you have it and your state allows companies to collect it. This doesn&#39;t directly impact other forms of insurance, but it does create a conflict of interest which many of us are concerned about where information gathering and data processing begins quietly connecting the dots behind the scenes. For example, suppose my brother takes a test in a state that allows it to be collected and his employer-provided life insurance policy collects it. There is nothing in place other than laws without actual enforcement to prevent it being connected to his health insurance records, which already contain information connected to his family health. This isn&#39;t a slippery slope, it&#39;s something we&#39;ve seen done in other industries with access to this level of connecting data. Even if the companies aren&#39;t so unscrupulous as to violate data laws, that doesn&#39;t prevent it from being swept up in AI pattern processes.

Nothing was mentioned. . . ? What about the derived data? That, unlike the samples, are now eternal, and family related. Since they can trace your forebears, whats to keep future software from projecting specifics of your progeny? <br>Since they&#39;ve previously shared data with law enforcement, under what conditions? Was a warrant required? If not why not? <br>It is your VERY PERSONAL information. Once your data is published there&#39;s no getting it back. What requirements, legal and ethical,  are they under to safegard your data? Apparently, any cop, data mining firm, insurance company, corporate headhunter, future father-in-law, grad student or bum can wander in off the street and obtain YOUR PERSONAL DATA!   Nope! Sorry but until there are LEGAL SAFEGARDS AND LIABILITIES regarding data security both digital and physical I&#39;ll be keeping my DNA to myself, despite my interest.<br>As an afterthought, even with safegards in force, what happens WHEN, not if, they get hacked?

As always, I really enjoy and live through your curiosity. I marvel at your work and am a big fan. I&#39;ve even reposted you videos to my nerd friends on LinkedIn - who enjoyed the posts.<br><br>Let me point out that my heritable traits are passed by genetic and epigenetic material. Epigenetic material  is relatively recently discovered and all the possible interactions between genetic and epigenetic material is still ambiguous/unknown at best. In this vein, there&#39;s bound to be more cellular or even molecular substance that suport trait heritability yet to be discovered (such discovery happens regularly as you may suspect). <br><br>The medical (legal, financial) implications have only been recently been evaluated. I could go on a long dialog about the information interaction between genetic and epigenetic materials but I&#39;m more concerned that this analysis - and now your video - doesn&#39;t really reflect the deeper complexity of interaction. I expect that this process is just beginning of discovering heritable materials in the cell much less heritable &quot;interchange&quot; materials that communicate and are communicated between cells. <br><br>The biggest privacy concern (which your video describes as &quot;handling&quot; but not information sharing)  is that heritable defects can be used against someone if say a risk management entity (like say an insurance company) or a financial entity (say a credit bureau or bank or VISA)  gets the defect information and decides to make a judgement call of &quot;risk&quot; based on only the genetic material not the epigenetic material or the interaction between these two molecules (by suppression or amplification of &quot;traits&quot;/defects). Information sharing of my genetic material may be patented by a company and I receive no compensation (isn&#39;t that theft?).  Of course these comments may be just be paranoid - I didn&#39;t get enough sleep last night - but it seems to me to be a logical concern.<br><br>I realize this may be a stretch but as a fan and a happy subscriber to your youtube channel (sorry, I&#39;m cheap...), I felt compelled to point this all out.

Control is power, as well with knowledge. Political leaders are seemingly always caught up in scandals and lies, while the well-being of society is sometimes overlooked, sabotaged, or purposefully mislead so the powers at be can retain and/or grow their positions. I think most educated individuals would agree I&#39;m not even touching base on any conspiracy theories, outlandish claims, or questionable heresy. <br>That being said, even if a reputable company like 23&amp;me is transparent with their intentions, operating entirely within the laws, and focusing a great deal of investment towards security and the privacy of their customers, it might make all the gathered data (DNA, genomes, ancestral, etc) difficult for an outside threat to obtain, but certainly not impossible. There are different levels of technology, weapons, information, etc, available to the public, than what a governmental agency has full access to. For example; I can go out tomorrow and purchase a firearm fairly easily, but for me to acquire a rocket launcher.. well, that&#39;s not going to happen, at least not while abiding by all state and federal laws. BUT, if we use an example from a higher level of [authority], our military can purchase rocket launchers in bulk. Now, if we keep going up levels we&#39;ll find more exclusivity and eventually reach examples of highly advanced technological innovation only available/known to the most elite.. whether that be small/secretive sectors of agencies like the Secret Service, CIA, NSA, FBI, or even some off-the-books privately funded battalion of hyper-advanced masterminds.. Most likely there&#39;s already an existing quantum-powered hacking server so far beyond anything that will be acknowledged/released publicly for decades past our grandchildren. <br>Truthfully, every ounce of our privacy and [freedom] could be stripped away by next week. Thankfully, as far as we know, that&#39;s unlikely. It&#39;s good to be prepared to an extent, but it can quickly become counterproductive to constantly overlook the present for fear of what the near future <b>might</b> bring. <br>In conclusion..

Geneticist appointments can be very expensive and difficult to come by. I would just hope that it never becomes standard practice until we can handle that sort of information.<br><br>For example I have a genetic connective tissue disorder of some type, that much is clear.  My doctors are also convinced I have, more specifically, Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome(most likely hypermobile type, hEDS given my history).  We aren&#39;t pursuing a confirmation from a geneticist for several reasons, though.  Some of it is clinical in nature, the diagnosis isn&#39;t required for proper treatment/monitoring &amp; the condition is relatively unknown enough that future doctors may not know what it means in an emergency anyway.  It would, clinically speaking, have minimal impact compared to just listing my symptoms and being on top of monitoring my health.<br><br> Other parts are practical in nature: a genetic work-up to rule out other forms of Ehlers-Danlos with known markers, alongside a clinical opinion from a geneticist confirming hEDS, would be thousands of dollars(and not covered by insurance) and feature a waiting list of 6+ months.  This is where a more medical-grade version of services like 23 &amp; Me could step in and help my physiatrist confirm the exact diagnosis himself, with little hassle and cost .<br><br>However, this leads into yet MORE practical concerns that have informed my healthcare team&#39;s opinion: with healthcare reform up in the air and current protections in question, an hEDS diagnosis could become a MASSIVE pre-existing condition if those come back at all.  Plus, going back to the lack of knowledge out there overly-cautious or underinformed doctors may only know about the rarest and grossest forms of the condition which render the label not just useless, but actively reinforcing improper care due to ignorance. I have an important, but not strictly necessary, surgery I am looking forward to in a few years; if I had hEDS on my record I could be denied it due to the surgeon googling it and finding horror stories about EDS fragility &amp; healing problems(which aren&#39;t terrible pronounced in me, the only issue is scars last a long time).<br><br>  Thus there are specific advantages, at the moment at least, to not having that specific label on my health records!  It&#39;s at best neutral to my health care, and worst cast scenario could be detrimental.  I wouldn&#39;t want to have a catch-all screener that confirmed a form of EDS being made a part of standard medical procedure, until those concerns were all eliminated as well.<br><br>While this technology could be really useful in giving people more accessible avenues to learn about their own genes and genetic conditions, it absolutely needs to be balanced with caution &amp; restraint given the deeply flawed nature of our healthcare systems.", "comment_date": "2017-11-21T22:54:02Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Sagae Whee", "comment_text": "Saying that you\u2019re only giving away a small amount of your sequence is misleading, as the 99.9% of it that they don\u2019t analyze is the exact same across all humans", "comment_date": "2017-11-18T20:55:19Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "j19241924", "comment_text": "can&#39;t decide.

I think most people don&#39;t understand how the medical reference laboratory business works and can&#39;t blame them. But for those who don&#39;t know, it&#39;s a high volume industry. I work for another lab and my department is one that basically sorts the samples to go to the testing departments. We accession something like 30,000 to 50,000 samples PER DAY at just our one facility. <br><br>HIPAA regulations are super strict about patient information privacy. The fact that Labcorp let you into their facility WITH A CAMERA TO POST ON YOUTUBE is actually more mind blowing than I think people can understand. They must have sanitized all the areas of actual samples beforehand. Even within our facility we are not allowed to have any cameras. Even if it&#39;s in the course of doing one&#39;s job it has to be done by people on a very short approved list, and only then if the frame will have ZERO PHI (patient health info), in the frame. Or, if for whatever reason a pic needs to be taken of a specific vial or manifest it has to again be done by someone who is trusted and approved to do so. Even our humble positions are required to be up to date every year with HIPAA regs in order to maintain employment with the company. While I can&#39;t speak for every lab, I&#39;m pretty sure all such labs in our country follow the same HIPAA guidelines.<br><br>Notice the lack of people in the departments. Notice how there wasn&#39;t a bunch of work being done? I&#39;m going out on a guess here but I&#39;m pretty sure most of those people (not counting the UPS guy lol), were managers or at least group leaders. Notice how everyone was on pins and needles? Watch their body language....nervous, hesitant. Because here&#39;s a guy with a video camera in the lab!! <br><br>It&#39;s actually pretty awesome, people just don&#39;t realize how strict HIPAA regs are. To the point that I&#39;m going to guess every vial you saw was an empty with a blank test label on it just in order to show the process. <br><br>As to people all bent out of shape over privacy. Guys, there&#39;s no way to even use that info. It isn&#39;t a sci-fi book were they can use it to track you down or somehow encrypt or decrypt things with it. Even IF somehow a shady government or public agency got the info, what are they getting? Oh right, the insurance thing right right.....so, how&#39;s that different than someone telling them they smoke before they get insurance? How&#39;s it different than telling them you have three drinks a day? Or that you have a couple of people in your family that died of cancer of a certain type??? It isn&#39;t. But this is all what-if and let&#39;s weigh the up and down side. So an insurance company in our what-if can glean that you are predisposed to a certain kind of cancer or other medical issue. The flip side is your doctor can also get said results and say &quot;omg hey you have a big chance to get &lt;some random ailment&gt; so we should do some tests!&quot;<br><br>Potentially saving my life........paying a higher premium.....hmm<br><br>Honestly, get a hobby already.

There are currently too many unknowns.  Plus, few doctors truly understand how to make use of this information in medical decision-making, let alone laypeople.  Between the uncertainty and cognitive phenomena like loss aversion, results from 23andMe are just as likely to lead a person to making an illogical life decision as a logical one.  And the field of pharmacogenomics (i.e. using genotyping to guide drug selection) is in its infancy, and probably a generation away from real life clinical application in all but a few, narrow situations (e.g. choosing chemotherapy based on genotyping of certain tumors).<br><br>Bottom line: This is fascinating from a medical research standpoint, and may be an integral part of healthcare in 25-50 years.  But today, in 2017, it&#39;s probably not worth your money (or privacy risk).", "comment_date": "2017-09-12T03:58:45Z", "likes_count": 8}, {"comment_by": "sweetlilochickadee", "comment_text": "Hi!!

However, as a scientist, I still have to point out that most of the issue relating to genotyping is not so much into the processing of the samples but more in the information that comes with it. The general public is not well prepared and well informed when it comes to genetic data.

In addition, GINA does not cover life, long-term care, or disability insurance providers.&quot; ... &quot;If you are asked by an insurance company whether you have learned Genetic Information about health conditions and you do not disclose this to them, this may be considered to be fraud.&quot;<br><br>Yikes!<br><br>It&#39;s also unclear how much information they associate with your account. They definitely ask for your full name and date of birth, although I suppose you do not have to provide real details. I do wonder if they store the address a particular barcoded tube was shipped to, which is harder to conceal if you are concerned about your privacy. They do sell kits in stores, but you still have to pay a separate lab fee through their website when you submit your sample, making it hard to have a truly anonymous 23andme account.<br><br>The bit about .02% of your DNA being analyzed is a bit misleading. If you go back and look at that bookshelf, there is a binder labelled &quot;exome,&quot; which contains only the coding regions of DNA, and accounts for about 1% of human DNA. 0.02% is still a lot smaller than 1%, but the vast majority of your DNA is identical to others (even other animals), so a relatively small number of SNPs could tell you a lot about a person.<br><br>I am also curious about what kind of data they give you if you are truly curious.

Who owns it, and who controls access to it?  As long as there is a trail connecting that sample number to your account info, it&#39;s not really anonymous.  <br><br>Perhaps most importantly, you need to ask yourself - how does this company make money?  According to Wikipedia, the company has raised over $240 million in venture funding - that&#39;s money that investors expect to see a return on.  Yet as of October 2015 they had not turned a profit.  That means that there will be methods of monitization implemented in the future that are not implemented right now.  It costs them significantly more than $199 to process your sample.  That means their business model is not going to be based on selling you information about your own genes.  Rather, it&#39;s going to be based on selling information about your genes to someone else (probably multiple someones).  Who those someone elses are is not yet clear, and may never be, but it&#39;s going to have to be someone who&#39;s willing to pay enough to make up the difference in cost, and then some.  Google was one big investor in 23andme. How difficult would it be for them to connect you to your sample if they are a buyer?  If you log into 23andme with a gmail account, then not hard at all.    <br><br>Do you get to control what information they sell, and to whom?  Or do they make you sign something that gives them the freedom to make those decisions without consulting or notifying you?  <br><br>Do they have the freedom at any time to change the policies that govern access to your information without your explicit opt-in?  <br><br>If you don&#39;t get fine-grained control over who they can share the information with, then you don&#39;t have control over your own privacy, or even know how your privacy might be impacted.  <br><br>And this is to say nothing of hackers, subpoenas, leaks, etc... <br><br>In conclusion - thanks for showing us the lab - it&#39;s always cool to see what technology actually looks like in practice.

Transparent and unbiased? That should raise a red flag. Nothing is ever unbiased.

It brings the company to the awareness of people who did not know about it, who will then make their own opinions. &quot;any publicity is good publicity&quot; right. Second, lets not forget that Destin is being REWARDED financially by 23andme.  Destin can say what he wants, but he&#39;s only human, and humans like rewards and act to reinforce them. I thought the questions that Destin asked were very &quot;safe&quot; and not particularly deep or technical.<br>Destin interviews a man who says he is not related to 23andme. Really? Is Labcor not a customer of 23andme? Does 23andme not pay Labcor large sums of money for their service? How do you think Labcor&#39;s profit would be affected if they said something negative about a customer of theirs.<br>Let&#39;s also not forget that both 23andme and Labcor are US companies. We already know the US government has backdoors to various tech companies, and engages in untargeted, mass, secret spying. We know the government is corruptible.  Do you think these companies would talk about classified stuff like that on a Youtube channel? We also know that large companies and governments get hacked, and data is stolen, fairly frequently.<br>If you do offer them your genetic data, is it going to help humanity?

You better believe that there will be practices with questionable ethics happening in the future. Once powerful people know the genetic makeup of an entire city (or more), it will be much easier to exploit the population with policy engineered towards certain physical or psychological traits.<br>I&#39;m not saying people should not use 23andme, or that we should be paranoid about it.

We have Lynch Syndrome in our family, which makes you much more likely to develop bowel cancers.

Now all the people in my family have to do is get a blood test, and the scientists know exactly where to look to see whether we have that syndrome or not. My mum was first to be tested and she has it, so she already knows my siblings and I each have a 50/50 shot. My sister found out at age 18 that she has the syndrome, so she can now manage other risk factors in her life and get regular and early screening tests. I don&#39;t have it, so I don&#39;t have to waste health resources getting stacks of screenings done for a condition I&#39;m no more likely to develop than Joe Blogs. I also know my children won&#39;t have it. We haven&#39;t convinced my brother to have the testing yet. My testing was not done by a private company and they only looked for this one condition, so it&#39;s quite different from 23andMe. I had my testing done my a genetics lab in Australia after getting a referral from my doctor. I had to go to a genetics councillor to have the test and the possible results explained to me. It was explained what the results (positive or negative) would mean and what my risks were for developing bowel cancer if we assumed a positive result. We even got my family tree out as part of the counselling! All of this was explained before I was allowed to sign the consent form for the blood test. It was a really good way to have the testing done.

The licensing is the major concern!! Michael Crichton even wrote his last book (&quot;Next&quot;) about the potential problems with this business model. It&#39;s hardly an example of literary excellence, but it does raise very important questions that should have been considered before making this video, or submitting a sample. In addition to the potential for &quot;designer&quot; genetic manipulation, which is also discussed in the book, there&#39;s the arguably larger problem of signing away your rights to your own sequence and any cell lines, tests, procedures, or treatments that may be developed from the sample you send. They can develop a treatment for a disease that you don&#39;t even know you have yet, based on what they learn and develop from your own cells and genetic code, and you not only won&#39;t have any rights to the profits from that treatment, but you will have to pay whatever crazy sums they want to charge if you need that treatment. In other words, they shouldn&#39;t be charging you for this service, they should be paying you!! <br><br>Seriously, look it up. It&#39;s right on their site (and on the sites of their competitors). But it&#39;s not in the privacy agreement, it&#39;s a separate agreement so most people don&#39;t find it when they take the time to read any of the terms. By submitting your sample you grant to them irrevocable, transferable rights  (meaning they can sell it to another party with their own motives and terms) to ANYTHING that comes from your sample. That is the single most broad license I&#39;ve ever heard of. Something 1/1000th as severe would be considered terrible for a copyright license, and this is far more significant than copyright.  <br><br>Destin, I love your videos, but I&#39;m afraid you&#39;ve done a disservice here by not covering this side of their business model. Please consider taking this video down, doing the relevant research (by all means, don&#39;t take my word for it), adding your findings in, and republishing it.

What they do have, however, is all of the important regions which code for what makes you, well you. <br><br>There are also highly conserved regions within our DNA which code for things that many different species would want since they are desirable traits. Traits like having a cell nucleus and how they are packaged, transported, stored, and simply function are processes that many organisms use. We have an exact match with 99.9 percent of any other given human, yet how are we so different? I&#39;m mean, hell, we have a 98 percent match with chimpanzees, a 85 percent match mice, and even a banana matches perfectly with 60 percent of our genome.

Yes, it might be that one has a SNP that increases the risk of heart failure which comes out of the test, however it might also be that you have another 3 SNPs that decreases the risk of heart failure which are not tested by 23andme (since these are &quot;rare&quot; SNPs). Therefore it is very difficult to make these risk assesments and I kinda missed this message in your video.<br><br>Anyway, keep up the good work! I really love your videos and you do a great job with them in making people interested in science. There should really be more people like you that are just curious about how the world works!<br><br>p.s.

This is because the vast majority of your DNA is made of repetitive &quot;non-coding&quot; sequences.  As an example one single type of repetitive sequence, called the ALU sequence, makes up about 10% of your DNA - this is more than all the &quot;coding&quot; elements put together!  When you look at how much of your DNA is coding data it&#39;s actually a very small amount, so they&#39;d actually be collecting a substantial amount of info on what makes you uniquely you, and this <b>could</b> still be used to identify you! While I say this though, the interesting fact is that in things like paternity tests, they actually don&#39;t use any coding data! They use the pattern of the non-coding elements - so in a paternity test they ironically identify the father from DNA that doesn&#39;t specifically code for the father or the child! <br><br>You may be wondering why there&#39;s so much non-coding DNA - interestingly they used to call this &quot;junk DNA&quot; as they knew it didn&#39;t make proteins and thought it was waste left over from evolution.  They actually used to remove this on early cloned animals, but through that they realised it&#39;s not actually &quot;junk&quot; (if you look up Dolly the sheep, one reason she actually got really ill because they removed her &quot;junk&quot; DNA).  This is actually used - amongst other things - to promote/inhibit/control what parts of the genome are expressed.  This is known as epigenetics (which also has a lot of other areas, not just this - it&#39;s truly fascinating!), and that&#39;s one of the new big areas of genetic research. With epigenetics, we now know that even the coding parts don&#39;t specifically code for who you are as there are further controls and some of it is never even used!  That is why for most genes they don&#39;t say &quot;You have X gene so you&#39;ll get X illness&quot; - they only say a % as your body may or may not use those genes in ways that cause that illness.  ...also this is different for every cell in the body as they&#39;re all pretty much independent.<br><br>If you want to read anything even more fascinating you should look into the human microbiome - which is how they actually think the DNA of organisms inhabiting out body could have even more impact on things like health than our own genome through (genetic) symbiosis!  The total bacteria inside you have potentially 100s of times more genetics data that you do, so if there is symbiosis there you can get how relevant that is - essentially they&#39;re an extension of your genome! ...worth remembering that next time you&#39;re prescribed a broad spectrum antibiotic (which basically aims to kill all internal bacteria!!).  With epigenetics and the human microbiome though, hopefully that shows why so little genetic info is still used in medicine and diagnostics.  DNA is not the simple blueprint of life we thought it was 20-30 years ago, so it&#39;s not a straight tool that can be used for diagnosis - it more shows you potentially how healthy or sick you <b>could</b> be, rather than what you <b>will</b> be.", "comment_date": "2017-09-07T15:02:26Z", "likes_count": 324}, {"comment_by": "Taylor Hedge", "comment_text": "You&#39;re awesome!!", "comment_date": "2017-09-07T15:02:22Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Charles Talhelm", "comment_text": "But they don&#39;t have to have all your genetic information, just the stuff that health insurance companies or employers might be able to discriminate against you for.
