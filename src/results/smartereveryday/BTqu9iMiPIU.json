This bugged me for a long time until I researched how Gyrocopters work, to put it simply, if you adjust the pitch of the blades the right way, the way the wind hits it from the bottom but at an angle, this makes the airfoil of the blade produce lift that is pointed not straight up but forward, the same direction the helicopter is flying in, causing the blades to spin forward (same way) as well. Pilot increases the rotation spin of the blades using this technique and right at the end pitches (or flares) the blades to produce lift back, causing the blades to slow down (but produce a lot of lift) and the helicopter slows down as well.<br><br>P.S If the pilot flared the blades right when the engine died at the high altitude, that would make the blades come to a complete stop and maybe turn backwards (don&#39;t know if that&#39;s even possible), now THAT would be like a pinwheel, it would also make the helicopter drop like a rock.", "comment_date": "2022-06-20T20:22:28Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "NetworKing", "comment_text": "This video I think was one of the most important I have ever watched. 2019 I almost went up in one really wanted to but long line and my fear engine dies and boom (which is what my dad always told me would happen) I gave up and left.

R/C helicopters, especially large scale R/C helicopters tend to have good disk loading.  I small 250 R/C helicopter is pretty bad at autorotations, but say a 700 class will float very nicely.  I suppose this is another thing is you don&#39;t want to try an autorotation in a Superstallion.  The Superstallion pilots I have talked to said all of their buddies who tried this crashed.  At least for my larger R/C helicopters when I was flying, I would always autorotate in.  It is actually safer because in addition to those ships being fairly floaty, making it easy to autorotate them, the big concern is hitting the ground wrong under power or having the vibrations of the helicopter on the ground with the vibrations of being at full power reverberating off of the ground and causing a gyro to misread due to the vibrations and flip the helicopter on the ground while under power.  (Usually with R/C helicopters you use an electric 3-axis based gyro to stabilize the helicopter, though it is an option to use a mechanical flybar.)  If you autorotate in and bleed off the rotor speed, you can reverse collective again close to the ground and make a nice, gentle, low blade kinetic energy landing.  Also for high speed fast forward flight autorotations, at least if you have strong metal blade grips (I have seen many plastic ones fail on other R/C helicopter pilots, so will never buy a kit with plastic ones), you can really spin up those blades and I have been able to stop the forward momentum when doing the final blade reverse and plopping the helicopter onto the ground without skidding and without any damage.  It is a bit tricky and normally I just go vertical when doing the final approach.<br><br>One major correction I would put in there is I have crashed while the blades were spinning while attempting an emergency autorotation while partially inverted.  After the umbrella gears to the tail rotor stripped, I ended up in a blade stall while trying to bring it in after hitting throttle hold.  (When you have at least nubs rubbing against each other, the tail blades still spin some and sometimes you can stop the out of control pirouetting by cutting the power, thus eliminating the torque causing the out of control pirouetting and the small amount of force from the slowly spinning tail rotor is enough to halt the pirouetting if you have enough space before hitting the ground.  Out of control pirouetting is an extra challenge when trying to flip your helicopter back over to a skids down position instead of a skids up position as in it is a special skill to know how to do a piro-flip when under control, let alone when that control is gone.)  A blade stall can be the rotors are spinning, but the airflow is turbulent as in a stall.  So helicopters stall just like planes except instead of not having enough forward speed to maintain laminar air flow over the wings, causing the angle of attack to be too great, the rotor is not spinning fast enough to maintain laminar air flow over the rotor blades.  So it looks like you might be able to save the helicopter from major damage, but then when you do the final reversal on collective, it just keeps going down like you didn&#39;t do anything and then you hear loud noises from the impact.  The ground judges swiftly and the ground judges harshly.", "comment_date": "2022-04-09T04:35:29Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "bingio", "comment_text": "<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTqu9iMiPIU&amp;t=5m57s\">5:57</a> Engine cutoff part.<br>You&#39;re welcome.", "comment_date": "2022-04-09T02:05:13Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Vert D", "comment_text": "He meant losing the tail rotor.", "comment_date": "2022-04-08T11:19:11Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Rich Perkin", "comment_text": "How often does that work - zero", "comment_date": "2022-03-31T21:20:54Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Jeffery Hall", "comment_text": "MUCH MUCH safer to land in a helicopter with no engine versus an airplane.

I hardly understood a sentence uttered in this video. I had the privilege of fly a helicopter once. Its was one of these adventures in which the pilot gives you a run down of about 20 minutes of what we were going to do then I would be given the controls at two thousand feet and basically fly the vehicle. What surprised me was how very little input was needed for the helicopter controls to carry out whatever it is the pilot was doing. Whenever you see in movies etc someone flying a helicopter they make it so dramatic. You see the pilot pushing the stick super hard at jarring levels and in reality its nowhere near that. The amount of touch needed on the stick to direct the vehicle is very little. Also what was amazing was experiencing a a free fall drop from 2000 ft to 400 ft in seconds, lol. I yelled out like a little girl even though I knew it was coming. I was then given the opportunity to try to maintain a hover of about six to ten feet off the ground while the pilot explained what to do. I found this to be the most difficult maneuver. I actually was not successful after a number of tries. Your trying to keep the tail from whipping around and maintaining this balance. Like I said it was only once I got to experience it but it was one of the most exciting things I&#39;ve ever done. I would love to do it more and actually get my license to pilot a copter. There is so much to learn before being able to actually get to the point of soloing. Its a dream I pray I can one day achieve.

To help quench misinformation: if you lose the tail-rotor, you are still able to fly the chopper safely.... You simply have to fly it like a plane by increasing your forward momentum.. You lose your vertical take off and landing capability without the rear stabilizer because if you fly too slowly forwards, as you aren&#39;t being stabilized with counter-rotation, and rotate / spin - which you can recover from, but if you fly it forward, quickly, it self-stabilizes....

At first I thought it must be wrong, but now I think it makes sense <b>if</b> you think about it as a fan blowing *upwards*, which was not at all clear from the video. (It&#39;s also possible that I&#39;m still mistaken/confused.)<br><br>To see why (I think) it couldn&#39;t be a fan blowing downwards:<br><br>1) Stick your right arm out to the side with your palm facing down, and imagine that it is a helicopter blade. Now tilt your arm slightly so that your thumb is pointing slightly up, and imagine what would happen if you swung your right arm forward (or if you were spinning counter-clockwise when viewed from above). You would create lift. Your arm would act as a fan pushing air downward.<br><br>2) Now consider if air started rushing up from underneath you (because you were falling perhaps, but somehow still maintaining a stable orientation). If you didn&#39;t change the tilt at all on your arm, then this would cause your arm to swing backwards (or cause you to spin clockwise when viewed from above) -- the opposite direction of spin from before. If instead you did change the tilt of your arm such that now your thumb was pointing slightly downwards, then you could continue spinning counter-clockwise, as before. Your arm is now acting as a pinwheel, where the air rushing from underneath is causing it to spin, slowing your descent. However, since the part of your arm-blade furthest away from you is moving through the air faster than the part in the middle, it might be moving through the air so fast that it&#39;s effectively pushing air upwards. It&#39;s also experiencing drag, and slowing your rotation.<br><br>So it seems to me that air moving over the pinwheel part of the blades causes the blades to rotate and slows your decent, while the outermost part of the blade is moving so fast that 1) it&#39;s experiencing significant drag, slowing the rotation of the blades, and 2) it&#39;s actually pushing air upwards, such that if it weren&#39;t for the pinwheel part, it would actually speed up your descent.<br><br>So then the trick is getting the blade tilt angle right so that you balance the rotational thrust and drag, and also the positive and negative vertical lift from the pinwheel and fan portions respectively. That&#39;s my layman&#39;s guess anyway.", "comment_date": "2019-02-06T06:58:38Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Robin Hood_XD", "comment_text": "<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTqu9iMiPIU&amp;t=1m31s\">1:31</a> huh nerd... uses auto focus!", "comment_date": "2019-02-06T04:36:01Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "jeremy red", "comment_text": "Lol de grass", "comment_date": "2019-02-05T13:08:37Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "SUPERNOVA", "comment_text": "Cool", "comment_date": "2019-02-05T02:47:52Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "240pixel", "comment_text": "Last time I checked every new pilot has to complete autorotation landing to complete the training...", "comment_date": "2019-02-04T17:54:26Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Winson Yang", "comment_text": "Auto rotation  depends on the altitude.

As far as autorotation goes, you&#39;re just slowing the fall - but that ability is limited. Look up helicopters autorotating and see how well that typically works in the real world. With engine failure, planes land at the same speed they normally land. They only land hard or tumble if there&#39;s nowhere safe to land (no obstructions). With that, helicopters have the same problem: trees, buildings, signage, poles, wires, etc. At least with a plane, once your engine goes out, you have plenty of time to pick out a safe landing spot - even a nearby airport. With a failed heli engine, you drop right away and have little to no choice of where you want to land. A Cessna will glide about 1.5 miles for every 1000 feet of altitude you have. In my experience waiting for a Cessna 172, with a failed engine, to reach the ground can be quite long and actually boring - in training at least!

I am a low-time pilot without about 160 hours in helicopters and 70 hours in airplanes. Let me see if I can answer some questions I saw in the comments:<br><br>1) all helicopters can autorotate. No one would build one that could not (not sure if you even could) and if they did it would not get certified. That said, some birds auto a lot &quot;nicer&quot; than others. I have only flown two kinds of helos: Enstrom piston and Hughes/Schweizer/Sikorsky 300 which is also piston. I have done way over 100 autos (all with recovery on the bottom, i.e. not &quot;full-down&quot; like in this video). An auto in an Enstrom is kind of like a non-event. The rotor is heavy enough that it has a bunch of energy from its weight which makes it almost like you are landing under power. The 300 has light blades so the autorotation has a lot more drama (plus the nose points toward the ground a lot more which &quot;feels&quot; scary). lighter the rotor the less time you have to get the collective down and start letting the wind spin the rotor for you, and once you are in the auto you still are flying in that you need to keep the rotor RPM in the safe zone by lifting the collective (it will overspeed if you do not) and you have all your flying functions (if you had a tailwind when you lost power, you turn 180 degrees while in the auto as you always want to auto into the wind if you can).<br><br>In any event, you can get it done and even if you did not land perfectly, when you hit the ground you are going very close to 0 knots compared to a Cessna 172 for example having a full flap stall speed of 47 knots so you are going to hit the ground going at least 40 knots. Fine if you are on a road, but a serious problem in rough terrain.<br><br>2) all helicopter pilots can do autos. It is part of the practical test you take to get your license and part of the biannual review you have to get every two years. This includes autorotations from a hover. Yes you can auto from any speed and any height above ground - although it is going to be a tough ask at low speed and low altitude. I used to fly out of a hangar next to the MD factory in Mesa, AZ and watch them do their advanced training. They would do auto after auto from less than 500 feet AGL and zero airspeed. It was scary as heck to watch (nose was pointed straight down until they flared really hard) but they got it done every time. Airspeed REALLY helps (this is why police and news helicopters like to fly circles when they are monitoring something on the ground), but it is not necessary. This is why we take off and land helicopters kind of like airplanes. Taking off at an angle and landing at an angle gives you at least some speed to maybe get the auto done if you lose power (should not be a problem on the way out without obstructions, but it going to bring on serious pucker on the way in).<br><br>3) the main rotor and tail rotor are mechanically connected on all helicopters, so when you are using the wind of falling to spin the rotor it is also powering the tail rotor, BUT note that the job of the tail rotor is to counteract the torque of the engine, so if you lose the engine you no longer need the torque compensation of the tail rotor. Some commenter\u00a0properly noted that because of this, an autorotation is the solution to an in-flight tail rotor failure. If you somehow lost your tail rotor in flight, the wind created by the speed of your helo will keep the tail behind you, but you are not going to have control when you slow down. So solution is fly at speed to a safe place then enter an autorotation and land without power.<br><br>Sorry so long.

Result: pulling collective increases the pitch of the rotor and produces more lift (to &quot;pop up&quot; over the wires) but dramatically slows the main rotor and the load on the rotor slows the turbine engine. Turbines take time (seconds, not instantaneous) to regain speed (i.e. &quot;spool up&quot;). In the mean time, the helicopter drops, not like a brick, more like a leaf, but definitely not like an autorotation. The downward fall does force air through the rotor (the pinwheel effect) which helps to speed up the rotor and helps to maintain some control (while still descending). In this instance (first hand experience), rotor speed and engine speed recovered sufficiently to avoid hitting the ground. Not certain a favorable outcome could be predicted in all cases.

They are literally rotating wings. They use lift in the exact same way as airplane wings do. The way they differ is how they manipulate the air flowing over them. An airplane simply moves part of its wing as the airflow is greatest over the outer part of the wing, but since a helicopter wing is rotating, the whole thing has to be tilted in order to properly manipulate airflow and get a response. This of course is done through what is called a swash plate via small arms that rotate on it and are connected to the pivot joints on the blades. This swash plate can tilt and raise or lower and as it does, the rods move up and down as they go around the plate and force the blades to tilt up and down as well. This forces lift at certain areas of the rotation causing the helicopter to move in whatever direction the pilot wants as he moves the collective or the control column. That&#39;s how they work basically. They are not fan blades and should not be thought of as such. if you look at their shape you will see that it is not conducive to the flow of air downwards. They are designed in a way where, much like an airplane wing, it causes pressure differences between the upper and lower parts of the  blade. Downward air movement is a consequence of this action but it is by no means the driving force behind how helicopters take off. That&#39;s just my two cents and basic knowledge on how helicopters work but it bothers me when i hear people treating helicopters like they are giant fans. Yes they move a lot of air but only by consequence of the action they are actually using to achieve lift.", "comment_date": "2016-12-07T22:05:37Z", "likes_count": 24}, {"comment_by": "Trey Black", "comment_text": "Ha.

Your &quot;dissertation&quot; on autorotation is strictly textbook theory.

Pull the video clips or tapes of the survivors (in incidents where there were survivors!) describing their experiences. Neither a pleasant or gentle experience as your film implies. This story of gentle, controlled landings while auto rotating was the same sad story owners and pilots of gyrocopters in the 1970&#39;s and 1980&#39;s were told, until videos of actual crashes showed them coming in speeds at 50 to 60 MPH (forward motion while auto-rotating), and then tumbling nose over tail until finally coming to a rest as a small pile of junk.

So a loss of power occurrence in a helicopter gives you a much smaller area from which to choose a suitable landing area. The huge advantage the helo has is that if energy is skillfully managed, it is possible to land with virtually zero airspeed.

Great video , I have an interesting question about this video, At 4 minutes and 5 seconds into the video you show the circular rotor disc of the helicopter. The red part of the circle is where the rotor disc acts as a pinwheel while the green part is where the rotor acts like a fan. I couldn&#39;t help but notice that the green circle is shifted just a bit to the left, and if this image is accurate then there is more area working as a fan on the left side as compared to the right side this should cause the helicopter to pitch forward due to gyroscopic precession, this is not in line with the previous image where the helicopter pitches back during autorotation, and if the helicopter has to pitch back then the green circle shown in the video should be shifted towards right half of the rotor disc this will cause more lift on the right side and consequently gyroscopic precession will cause the helicopter to pitch back. This makes more sense because of the concept of dissymmetry of lift, the advancing blade will generate more lift than the retreating blade, this is where I have a doubt.<br>Also for autorotation to occur the pitch of the blades has to be negative, only then will they continue spinning CCW and if the blades have negative pitch then how will they act as a fan blowing air downwards? It will only blow air upwards.<br>I am confused can you please clarify !<br>Thanks for making these awesome videos", "comment_date": "2016-05-06T07:40:18Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Obscure Machines", "comment_text": "He was half right....Robinsons turn into bricks.", "comment_date": "2016-05-06T03:19:11Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "drummerboynano17", "comment_text": "I should start a fitness channel and name it StrongerEveryDay.", "comment_date": "2016-05-06T02:25:06Z", "likes_count": 2}, {"comment_by": "Jack Plays", "comment_text": "So cool", "comment_date": "2016-05-06T02:08:26Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Mikey of the Long Road", "comment_text": "Dude, Your videos are awesome! :)", "comment_date": "2016-05-06T01:04:24Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Leandro Almeida", "comment_text": "<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTqu9iMiPIU&amp;t=8m55s\">8:55</a> I lol&#39;ed really hard!

Helicopters are not &quot;safer&quot;, for several reasons:<br><br>1. Helicopters tend to fly lower, meaning that the time between an engine failure and touchdown is much shorter than with a fixed-wing aircraft.<br>2. Helicopters don&#39;t have a glide ratio that is comparable to most planes (basically only fighter planes with tiny wings glide worse). What that means is that if you have an engine failure, not only did you start lower, but you have much less range to find a suitable landing area for a given amount of altitude. Granted, a &quot;suitable landing area&quot; for a helicopter under autorotation is much smaller than that one for a fixed-wing aircraft!<br>3.

Do it right, and the landing is soft, and the blades are spinning slowly.<br>The more inertia in the blades the better. That is why the Huey had just two blades, it was almost guaranteed you were able to autorotate safely.

The air being pushed down, the so-called &quot;rotor wash&quot;, is not the force that keeps the helicopter in the air.  Each of the rotor blades is an airfoil (in one section of your video you can see the profile of the rotor blade); as the rotor blades spin, each rotor generates lift like the wing of an airplane.  The lift generated by the rotor blades is what keeps the helicopter in the air.<br><br>The swash plate varies the pitch of each blade as they rotate through a full rotation cycle, which alters the lift generated by each blade.  Varying the lift of each blade at all points through the rotation cycle is how the helicopter can move side to side and back to front  (pitch and roll, respectively), etc.<br><br>The tail rotor blades are also airfoils, and generate lift, and with varied pitch, counter act the yaw force of the rotor blades and allow the helicopter to swing it it&#39;s nose left to right (yaw).<br><br>I love your videos!

Stated simpler: in powered flight it flies by lift and unpowered it glides by drag created by the rotating wing just as fixed wing airplane does", "comment_date": "2016-04-26T19:54:33Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Art Connolly", "comment_text": "hey Dustin I fly rc helicopters and much like their larger cousins. the model can also auto rotate. in order to do it you need forward momentum and a small bit of &quot;negative pitch &quot; which builds the head speed back up. right before you hit the ground you go positive pitch and pull the nose up slightly and revs  up the rotor speed even higher which gives yoy enough for a gentle touch down. they are awesome especially when you have $3000 ridding in you not messing it up. lol I always thought the big birds used the same method.

This I don&#39;t feel I can share, because it&#39;s so crammed full of fast information that I think it could be alienating to people who don&#39;t already understand some helicopter physics.<br><br>Having watched your Helicopter Deep Dive, I really feel like this didn&#39;t explain what happens in a clear way. It could be explained as simply as: the pilot changes the angle of the blades so the wind from falling speeds up their rotation, then the pilot changes the angle back to normal so the blade&#39;s new rotation is spent slowing the descent.<br><br>Don&#39;t get me wrong, the video does cover everything. It does eventually say that &#39;he bleeds off the rotational energy in the form of lift&#39;, which not only is a confusing way to say it but it is said REALLY quickly- it&#39;s the most important part! Also the fact that the pinwheel vs fan effect happens simultaneously on different parts of the blade is interesting but really not integral to understanding why this works, yet the video shows this before even explaining how they relate to each other. Lastly, the fact that spinning too fast can damage the blades is kinda irrelevant to the physics of <b>why it works at all</b>; it&#39;s just something they have to be careful of. <br><br>The ultimate problem is that the video initially tries to say that falling can spin up the blades, then talks about three other complicated things before finally finishing the point (of using the new spin to slow down the fall). Even during the actual autorotation scene this isn&#39;t fully explained, like at the end when it is said that &quot;right here at the bottom he&#39;s gonna flare it and when he flares it that trades off the kinetic energy in the system into... There we go...&quot; That was so close, it was nearly explained fully! Even so, using terms like &#39;kinetic energy&#39; instead of &#39;rotation&#39; and the very unspecific &#39;system&#39; still doesn&#39;t help.<br><br>On a positive note, loved the adventures you had on the glacier!
