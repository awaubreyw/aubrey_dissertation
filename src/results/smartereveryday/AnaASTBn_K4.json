Anyway this strange character taught us about why a whip cracks is because it beaks the speed barrier. When he explained it he likened it to the way einstein said time travel is possible. It&#39;s the curve of the whip  straightening out, or the ability to travel on a straight plane of time and being hurled in such a way that it accelerates due to the curved end straightening out. Keep in in mind we were a bunch of young teens happened upon by an older teen, who were partaking in some of the greatest  cannabis known to man in the year of our lord 2005. I believe this particular batch was the train wreck, but could have been the white rhino.

I put my hand flat on a pool surface and plunge it into the pool quickly. This creates a pocket that collapses and it explodes as the water rushed back. Is this the same as the whip(frayed end)? In my scenario you have two separate bodies, water and air. It hard to tell because the  air is too similar so only the event is witnessed. My speculation is that the whip is snatching a pocket of air out of contention with the rest and with the frayed end we might be seeing the air collapse back into the invisible void, creating an explosion. Both whip heads break barrier but the frayed one seems to detonate and even push the tip further. Thanks for the video. What if you use chalk dust to shed particles at event to assist in seeing what&#39;s happening?

You&#39;re transmitting that initial force waveform into a smaller and smaller area of the whip body to accelerate and amplify it.  The cracker at the end is dramatically smaller and fan shaped specifically to dump all the energy of the waveform at the end of the swing, accelerating the tip past the sound barrier and causing the sonic boom crack we&#39;ve all come to expect.  Or so it would seem...<br><br>I would suggest that the last acceleration and amplification of the waveform is actually being caused by the phase change between the energy of the swing being transmitted by the solid matter of the whip fibers into the much-less-dense fluid of the air around it.  That last jump in energy at the end accelerates the actual air molecules around that last section of the whip so fast that they cause explosive friction against the static air around them.  So in essence, it&#39;s not the actual whip that&#39;s cracking, it&#39;s the air at the end of the whip cracking against itself.   <br><br>So I guess a whip is literally a form of energy-amplifying fan...since you&#39;re literally using it&#39;s properties to move tiny amounts of air molecules so fast that they can&#39;t get out of the way of each other.  The fact that the boom actually happens in the air is also why the whip inself stays intact afterwards. If the waveform collapsed any sooner, you&#39;d likely explode the end of the whip every time you used it.  <br><br>Funny to imagine what a whip would do if it were uses in other more or less dense atmospheres or fluids.

But I think the acceleration is still high even if the diameter or density is constant along the length of the whip. This is because of the following fact. <br><br>At any time during whipping, we can devide the whip into two parts the upper part (near the tip) and the lower part (near the hand). The main momentum is generated by only the upper part because the lower part is almost stationary during whipping. Due to the law of conservation of momentum, the upper part has to speed up because the length (and mass) is decreasing during whipping. The rate of relative decrease of mass of upper part is, in fact, accelerating toward the end of the whipping process, which results in accelerating rate of relative increase of the speed.", "comment_date": "2021-09-12T15:45:29Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "MuR Ch", "comment_text": "I like how I&#39;m so stupid and don&#39;t understand a thing but i still enjoy watching", "comment_date": "2021-09-12T13:21:31Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Joel Jones", "comment_text": "Now watch me whip", "comment_date": "2021-09-11T13:45:20Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "rw b", "comment_text": "There&#39;s an episode of The Sporkful podacast from about 5 years ago where Kenji Lopez-Alt talks about how this applies to slurping noodles- check it out!", "comment_date": "2021-09-10T23:28:16Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Hafsaoui Aymen", "comment_text": "Passed from her great grandpa to her....", "comment_date": "2021-09-09T17:00:25Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "albee", "comment_text": "Musk: that plane tho", "comment_date": "2021-09-09T04:46:02Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Cool Cat", "comment_text": "Kinky \ud83d\ude09", "comment_date": "2021-09-09T02:10:47Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Khalifasound", "comment_text": "Love the video<br>...", "comment_date": "2021-09-06T18:30:48Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Kenneth Janczak", "comment_text": "really great<br>Thanks for taking the time to make the video, it was really interresting......", "comment_date": "2021-09-06T09:44:14Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Thomas Elmer", "comment_text": "Do you think part of the energy transfer is related to the Mould effect in a chain fountain?", "comment_date": "2021-09-03T19:01:56Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Parker Smart", "comment_text": "&quot;That hurts like a mother.&quot;  \ud83e\udd23", "comment_date": "2021-09-01T23:22:33Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Byron smith", "comment_text": "The cracker/popper is still very necessary.

Almost as though the tail end of the wave is the portion of the shockwave that carries the force of the shockwave. This seems to be something I\u2019ve also noticed in videos with sonic booms from volcanic eruptions, to even the Beirut blast. When slowed down, the glass from the Beirut blast and the force from a video of a volcanic eruption filmed on a boat, isn\u2019t felt immediately upon the initial connection of the sound wave. It seems as though the force is just milliseconds behind the blast.

After that you can purchase your &quot;free&quot; trial. Hmm, not free I guess since it charges you after 30 days. So now you are stuck with another 30 days of paying for this thing because you had a busy schedule and forgot to cancel your membership and it automatically charged you instead of asking first. Why pay $14.95 for one book I am never going to listen to in 30 days when I can buy the same book on ebay for $5.00 cheaper or even $10.00 cheaper at my local library (Yes I found it just for  this comment.) and use it at my discretion. What if I like the book and want to read it again but do not want to go through the hassle of finding the download, assuming I get to keep it at all? This audiobook fad is ridiculous and if you disagree I suggest you go read more because it is good for your brain to be challenged.

I suggest you go purchase the book, &quot; How to be emotionally strong and have thick skin: An Essential Guide to Developing Emotional Strength&quot; by Nicola Trilliby because you are clearly willing to spend ridiculous amounts of money on things that you do not need.<br><br><br>Sincerely,   Annoyed", "comment_date": "2020-08-20T06:22:12Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Grant Grueninger", "comment_text": "John <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnaASTBn_K4&amp;t=2m15s\">2:15</a> on the end card, perfect.", "comment_date": "2020-08-20T04:02:27Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Michael Antonio", "comment_text": "<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnaASTBn_K4&amp;t=8m37s\">8:37</a> That 3rd &quot;There you go&quot;, is all it took for me to not like him.", "comment_date": "2020-08-20T02:24:57Z", "likes_count": 3}, {"comment_by": "FallingAway", "comment_text": "She\u2019ll be good at wiping her children", "comment_date": "2020-08-20T00:38:45Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Ham", "comment_text": "I thought you were talking about the month April", "comment_date": "2020-08-20T00:30:05Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Mimon Baraka Gaming VEVO HD", "comment_text": "Schleren :D wtf SCHLIEREN", "comment_date": "2020-08-19T13:51:32Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "fuz nightmare", "comment_text": "\u201cI know this sounds crazy but im already changing the way i beat my kids in everyday life now that i understand how a whip works\u201d", "comment_date": "2020-08-18T16:59:08Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Clementken Secillano", "comment_text": "I can do that with a handkerchief or bandana\ud83e\udd23", "comment_date": "2020-08-17T14:12:12Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Convicted not Convinced", "comment_text": "bullwhip aint the only thing in this video with a tip, if you catch my drift.", "comment_date": "2020-08-17T05:17:46Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Megan Burson", "comment_text": "Ok soooooo.....

At <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnaASTBn_K4&amp;t=8m12s\">8:12</a> you say that it looks like the tip of the whip is getting pulled along behind the shock wave.  I think rather that the velocity of the whip tip has a) slowed because it hits itself (actualizing and losing its potential energy), and b) is slower than the speed of sound.  Thus, the sound wave is &quot;out-running&quot; the tip and it appears as though the tip is chasing the wave. <br><br>Also, the probable reason that the knot disallows the pop is that it has changed the flow of the taper and the bulk at the tip then acts like a bobble-head bouncing around and cannot strike the smallest tapered piece, since it&#39;s bulk prevents it from slamming into it.  The speed increases down the length of the taper until the larger mass at the end &quot;slowly&quot; catches up and deadens the velocity increase, preventing the breaking of the sound barrier, thus disabling the potential snap.

Awesome! However, it leaves me with one question - mind you i&#39;m no engineer or aerodynamicist, just an aviation enthusiast and lover of science - why does it appear that, right at the shock wave formation, the tip seems to be &quot;thrust&quot; forward or &quot;pulled&quot; or seems to accelerate much more rapidly at the time it breaks the sound barrier? I know you said you were still analyzing it, but does it have anything to do with finally breaking through the heavy wave drag when approaching the sound barrier? My understanding in the aviation world is that there is a significant decrease in drag once the transonic region is breached and you are traveling at supersonic speeds. Is this correct? I couldn&#39;t stop focusing on that point in the video. It was incredible to see what looked like a rapid instantaneous acceleration once the shock wave was created. Anyway, I know i&#39;m a couple years behind, no just finding this video, but if you or anyone else cares to comment on the question, that would be great! keep up the great content!

And at the moment when the sound wave accurs, the tip of the whip (which actually creates it), travels at the same speed as the sound wave. Still impressive, but I don&#39;t see on your videos how the whip breaks the speed of sound. Probably because of my insufficient knowledge of English or science behind it or both.

I have watched the video through, and from what I can see ,and more importantly hear, is that the whip actually has 2 shock waves,which is why when you crack a whip you hear the (crrra pirre sound). When watching the 2 examples of the whip (one with the frayed end and one with the knot) you will notice the one with the frayed end starts a shock wave and then as the frayed end comes through you see a second shock wave push the other wave through giving you the (crrra pirre) sound, I would be willing to bet that when you did the test with the knotted end you did knot get the same sound as you can see that the shock waves are not the same as the frayed end example. they both break the sound barrier but your sounds would be different", "comment_date": "2020-05-28T12:49:34Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Gianni135", "comment_text": "<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnaASTBn_K4&amp;t=9m29s\">9:29</a><br>Elon Musk baby name", "comment_date": "2020-05-27T21:35:04Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "james johnston", "comment_text": "This man is in love", "comment_date": "2020-05-27T15:32:24Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "JessLe", "comment_text": "<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnaASTBn_K4&amp;t=4m04s\">4:04</a> That staple though", "comment_date": "2020-05-27T10:04:14Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Akotski1338", "comment_text": "When you whip someone, how does it not break skin", "comment_date": "2020-05-27T09:44:48Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Itger Dijkstra", "comment_text": "I can break the sound barrier with my controller.", "comment_date": "2020-05-26T17:19:21Z", "likes_count": 2}, {"comment_by": "Jason W", "comment_text": "I&#39;m feeling things I haven&#39;t felt before.....

At the moment of snap, the end gets a lot of kinetic energy, but not from the wave coming up the rope. It snaps before the wave reaches it. Where does it get the kinetic energy from? Because at that same moment it goes super sonic, the sound waves it&#39;s emitting get faster than the waves before. The epicenter of the current wave is outside the past wave, causing the two waves to collide and push each other. So the air moves together with those waves at the speed of sound. That air movement totally removes air friction for rope and gives it a lot more kinetic energy. All tho I&#39;m not sure if it gives... The rope it self is traveling the same speed as air- supersonic. So maybe it only removes air friction for the rope? Many of you say what air friction is too weak, it doesn&#39;t do that much...

As discussed, conservation of momentum of this wavelength (getting smaller and smaller towards the tip) ends up being unable to continue propagating as a solid wave (the whip), which allows the momentum to transfer to the surrounding air as the tip of the whip is reversing direction (the sudden and drastic hyper-acceleration into supersonic speeds - the crack)<br>Perhaps this experiment could be developed further by creating known wavelengths of initial energy inputs, coupled with varying speeds of this initial wavelength.

It&#39;s hard for a layman like myself to form an impression of just how far into the movement of the whip <b>some</b> part of it reaches and then exceeds the speed of sound.

One would <b>expect</b> the tip of the whip to continue accelerating after the crack but the critical moment has passed and further acceleration would happen silently, or nearly so.\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>Whoops!

It has a definite begining and end and its curiouse to me that the tip is not pulled tight as is comes on screen making me think that it is tight at the begining of the stroke (an assumption but a good one i believe) then moves into the zone prior to coming on screen.  Is it posible then that we are seeing it leave the zone, break the barrier and then return to the zone.    When the tip is taught and moving above the sound barrier it should be in a area of even pressure where the front and back of the tip (just the tip not the wip)  are simply moving through air with a stable pressure due to no longer having to contend with the forces of the zone hence keeping it in the middle of the shockwave until the drag coeficient is high enough to overcome the pressure behind the tip or another outside force slows it to somewhere  below mach 1.2 down to mach .8 or soo. This may explain why we see the tip moving inside of a turbulent area directly prior to the formation of the shock wave and another area of turbulence directly after.   Another theory I have is that the tip is being partially drug by the wip and partially pushed along because of the high pressure region created behind it due to the pressure farther down its path being reduced by the shockwave.  This sould only be in play after the tip speed falls below the zone and the sound begins to outrun it.<br><br>Is it possible that both of these are at work in this system.<br><br>Great video!!!

The first as you have stated is the energy transport by the wave.     It is a rope attached at one end (node at the stationary hand after the energy was put in) and the wave travels the length of the whip up to the last moments .     Once the wave gets near the tip, the mechanism changes.    Instead of a long traveling wave, the mechanism becomes chaotic because the masses of the tip section and the section just before it are harmonic oscillators with each other.  It becomes a two pendulum problem when the wave nears the end of the whip since the mass of the string on one side of the whip approaches the mass at the end of the whip.  Under these conditions, there will be a momentum exchange between the two harmonic oscillators.     Normally it would be chaotic but the the driving mass of the length of the whip still exists so this condition of harmonic oscillation of the tip and the near tip string are, in effect, forced.    This yields the result in a two pendulum system where the heavier end of the pendulum is not moving very fast but the second pendulum has had the momentum nearly all transferred to is resulting in a very high velocity for one oscillation.    Of course this is the place for the Lagrangian equations of motion for the two pendulum system (2DOF) to explain the high tip velocity .", "comment_date": "2019-01-30T03:48:23Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "randobad", "comment_text": "Like max q", "comment_date": "2019-01-30T03:36:00Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Josie", "comment_text": "I literally just realized he\u2019s the guy from What\u2019s Inside?", "comment_date": "2019-01-30T03:13:35Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "vexes908", "comment_text": "Its always fun when I see my university in a video.

Looking at the loop in the whip that the wave creates, the momentum is gradually increasing along the next whip segments. Once it gets to the tip, there should be a breaking point where the whole tip is moving at the same speed as the base of the wave and when the wave continues to get shorter, that energy of multiple segments from the wave transfers as a higher velocity at the tip, a velocity much higher than the base wave velocity. I believe something like this could also explain why the tip doesn&#39;t slow down and breaks the sound barrier despite it having more mass than the previous sections of the whip.<br>Perhaps this rapid transference &quot;consumes&quot; the wave energy so fast that the wave never gets completed at the whip end just before the tip, explaining why in the video it looks like the whip cracks before the loop is completely unraveled; it seems that there is a point where the loop freezes just before the tip making an &quot;S&quot; shape <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnaASTBn_K4&amp;t=8m14s\">8:14</a>", "comment_date": "2019-01-25T03:47:18Z", "likes_count": 5}, {"comment_by": "Sophie Whitehouse", "comment_text": "I love how my TV glitched the sound out of sync", "comment_date": "2019-01-25T02:45:04Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Jefferson Silveira", "comment_text": "I was just wondering.....

Due to the temperature of the aircraft skin during high-speed flight, they were required to use a wet wing without an integral bladder.  This basically means that the wings are the fuel tank and no rubber or other type of material could be used to prevent leakage of the fuel from the wing.  Also as a result of the temperature of the aircraft skin during high-speed flight, the joints between the titanium sheets were not directly abutted when the aircraft was cold.  When the skin would heat up, the sheets would expand, sealing the inter-sheet cracks but not causing over-expansion and buckling.  The design tolerances were very tight on this aspect as they needed the cracks to close as much as possible to reduce turbulence at the surface of the skin (and increase aerodynamic drag) but also prevent the aforementioned buckling.  <br>The combination of the wet wing and the non-expanded sheets caused the SR-71 to leak fuel like a sieve prior to takeoff.  Basically, the sequence would be something like:<br>* Fuel the aircraft at the end of the runway with engines running.<br>* Immediately take off with fuel leaking at a high rate.<br>* Perform a sufficient number of high speed passes to heat up the skin and close the cracks.<br>* Receive in-air refueling and proceed to mission.<br><br>The SR-71 is an absolutely crazy aircraft and was purpose built for high altitude reconnaissance at ultra high speed.

Those are to test if the same things happen when you use a TOWEL as a whip. Using a towel as a whip is why i could have told you before hand that the flared ends on the whip WERE NOT THE CAUSE of the crack sound, because a towel will do the same thing and its solid, and will even having its tip ripped after breaking the sound barrier a few times and in my experiences will become less as effective. Also, i believe that the whip being tapered also DOES NOT have anything to do with it speeding up as a towel is not tapered either. So there are two problems with your theories. So what i purpose is that as the TIP of either a whip or a towel is being pulled behind the rest of it, when the whip/towel reaches its length limit, the sudden stop in forward momentum causes the whip/towel to then be jerked back on itself, this causes the section that is being pulled along at the tip to suddenly and VERY quickly increase in speed for just a millisecond in order to catch up with the rest of it. As we can see in the video the whip&#39;s momentum even cause it to bounce itself back towards the user even when they are not physically pulling the whip back themselves. Just the way i think about it, is how when a jet plane or a car makes a fast and sudden turn at high speed it creates a sudden increase in G forces in one direcrion, which can cause extra movement that be felt more towards the rear of the vehicle and why some people will get car sick riding in the rear but not the front. But anyways, This quick and violent increase in speed causes the tip of both a whip and a towel to get that last little bit of speed it needs in order to break the sound barrier. Up until that time the entire length of the whip is moving at relatively the same speed and has nothing to do with it being tapered or not or having those little flared ends on it or not, but rather has MUCH more to do with the LENGTH of the overall whip and the WEIGHT of the tip. Where a whip will have the knots at the end and even those &quot;tassels&quot; to add a small ammount of weight just as in how a towel with a wet tip to add a small ammount of weight will work better as well. Just a few a things that make HUGE differences that i REALLY wish you would have thought about and would have really liked to have seen looked at closer is all. Let me know what you think.

From start to finish, the momentum of the mass of the entire whip is transferred to the mass of the very tip. As mass of moving portion of the whip decreases, speed increases. This is why you can get the same effect with a charging cable (or a rope) that is not tapered.

People often asked us if, because of this fact, it was fun to fly the jet. Fun would not be the first word I would use to describe flying this plane. Intense, maybe. Even cerebral. But there was one day in our Sled experience when we would have to say that it was pure fun to be the fastest guys out there, at least for a moment.<br><br>It occurred when Walt and I were flying our final training sortie. We needed 100 hours in the jet to complete our training and attain Mission Ready status. Somewhere over Colorado we had passed the century mark. We had made the turn in Arizona and the jet was performing flawlessly. My gauges were wired in the front seat and we were starting to feel pretty good about ourselves, not only because we would soon be flying real missions but because we had gained a great deal of confidence in the plane in the past ten months. Ripping across the barren deserts 80,000 feet below us, I could already see the coast of California from the Arizona border. I was, finally, after many humbling months of simulators and study, ahead of the jet.<br><br>I was beginning to feel a bit sorry for Walter in the back seat. There he was, with no really good view of the incredible sights before us, tasked with monitoring four different radios. This was good practice for him for when we began flying real missions, when a priority transmission from headquarters could be vital. It had been difficult, too, for me to relinquish control of the radios, as during my entire flying career I had controlled my own transmissions. But it was part of the division of duties in this plane and I had adjusted to it. I still insisted on talking on the radio while we were on the ground, however. Walt was so good at many things, but he couldn&#39;t match my expertise at sounding smooth on the radios, a skill that had been honed sharply with years in fighter squadrons where the slightest radio miscue was grounds for beheading. He understood that and allowed me that luxury.<br><br>Just to get a sense of what Walt had to contend with, I pulled the radio toggle switches and monitored the frequencies along with him. The predominant radio chatter was from Los Angeles Center, far below us, controlling daily traffic in their sector. While they had us on their scope (albeit briefly), we were in uncontrolled airspace and normally would not talk to them unless we needed to descend into their airspace.<br><br>We listened as the shaky voice of a lone Cessna pilot asked Center for a readout of his ground speed. Center replied: &quot;November Charlie 175, I&#39;m showing you at ninety knots on the ground.&quot;<br><br>Now the thing to understand about Center controllers, was that whether they were talking to a rookie pilot in a Cessna, or to Air Force One, they always spoke in the exact same, calm, deep, professional, tone that made one feel important. I referred to it as the &quot; Houston Center voice.&quot; I have always felt that after years of seeing documentaries on this country&#39;s space program and listening to the calm and distinct voice of the Houston controllers, that all other controllers since then wanted to sound like that, and that they basically did. And it didn&#39;t matter what sector of the country we would be flying in, it always seemed like the same guy was talking. Over the years that tone of voice had become somewhat of a comforting sound to pilots everywhere. Conversely, over the years, pilots always wanted to ensure that, when transmitting, they sounded like Chuck Yeager, or at least like John Wayne. Better to die than sound bad on the radios.<br><br>Just moments after the Cessna&#39;s inquiry, a Twin Beech piped up on frequency, in a rather superior tone, asking for his ground speed. &quot;I have you at one hundred and twenty-five knots of ground speed.&quot; Boy, I thought, the Beechcraft really must think he is dazzling his Cessna brethren. Then out of the blue, a navy F-18 pilot out of NAS Lemoore came up on frequency. You knew right away it was a Navy jock because he sounded very cool on the radios. &quot;Center, Dusty 52 ground speed check&quot;. Before Center could reply, I&#39;m thinking to myself, hey, Dusty 52 has a ground speed indicator in that million-dollar cockpit, so why is he asking Center for a readout? Then I got it, ol&#39; Dusty here is making sure that every bug smasher from Mount Whitney to the Mojave knows what true speed is. He&#39;s the fastest dude in the valley today, and he just wants everyone to know how much fun he is having in his new Hornet. And the reply, always with that same, calm, voice, with more distinct alliteration than emotion: &quot;Dusty 52, Center, we have you at 620 on the ground.&quot;<br><br>And I thought to myself, is this a ripe situation, or what? As my hand instinctively reached for the mic button, I had to remind myself that Walt was in control of the radios. Still, I thought, it must be done - in mere seconds we&#39;ll be out of the sector and the opportunity will be lost. That Hornet must die, and die now. I thought about all of our Sim training and how important it was that we developed well as a crew and knew that to jump in on the radios now would destroy the integrity of all that we had worked toward becoming. I was torn.<br><br>Somewhere, 13 miles above Arizona, there was a pilot screaming inside his space helmet. Then, I heard it. The click of the mic button from the back seat. That was the very moment that I knew Walter and I had become a crew. Very professionally, and with no emotion, Walter spoke: &quot;Los Angeles Center, Aspen 20, can you give us a ground speed check?&quot; There was no hesitation, and the replay came as if was an everyday request. &quot;Aspen 20, I show you at one thousand eight hundred and forty-two knots, across the ground.&quot;<br><br>I think it was the forty-two knots that I liked the best, so accurate and proud was Center to deliver that information without hesitation, and you just knew he was smiling. But the precise point at which I knew that Walt and I were going to be really good friends for a long time was when he keyed the mic once again to say, in his most fighter-pilot-like voice: &quot;Ah, Center, much thanks, we&#39;re showing closer to nineteen hundred on the money.&quot;<br><br>For a moment Walter was a god. And we finally heard a little crack in the armor of the Houston Center voice, when L.A.came back with, &quot;Roger that Aspen, Your equipment is probably more accurate than ours. You boys have a good one.&quot;<br><br>It all had lasted for just moments, but in that short, memorable sprint across the southwest, the Navy had been flamed, all mortal airplanes on freq were forced to bow before the King of Speed, and more importantly, Walter and I had crossed the threshold of being a crew. A fine day&#39;s work. We never heard another transmission on that frequency all the way to the coast.<br><br>For just one day, it truly was fun being the fastest guys out there.", "comment_date": "2019-01-07T07:30:20Z", "likes_count": 32}, {"comment_by": "Anna", "comment_text": "What&#39;s up with her voice", "comment_date": "2019-01-07T07:10:01Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Benjamin Ramirez", "comment_text": "...<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>Johnny<br><br><b>Test</b>", "comment_date": "2019-01-07T06:32:06Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Timmy Strace", "comment_text": "Hey Destin, I have an idea for ya.

It looked like the tip was pushing the shockwave along - much like the waves created if you quickly drag your hand through water. Perhaps it&#39;s sheer ignorance on my part, since I certainly can&#39;t claim to be a major science nerd or anything, but it seems logical enough that, at a certain rate of speed, the drag against the tip would become so great that the tip would begin physically displacing air rather than passing through it - sort of like holding your hand, palm open, out of a car window when traveling down the freeway. Of course, if the whip operates the same way with a pointed (i.e. - not threaded or splayed) tip, that would about wrap up that argument, since at that point the aerodynamics should (in my case) prohibit any such displacement.<br><br>If I&#39;m right, however, it stands to reason that the snapping sound corresponding to the shockwave would be the point at which the whip collides with the pseudo-solid wall of air pressure, no?<br><br>I can&#39;t help but feel like I&#39;m just an idiot stumbling in the dark, thinking that maybe just some of this actually makes sense. If so, I dearly hope someone educates me on it, because I am immensely curious.<br><br>I&#39;m also trying to wrap my head around the concept of interference drag, since that seems relevant here, but overall this is just a very fascinating subject to arise from a very mundane thing.

Also tensions can play role in the process, perhaps in the end the wave is so compressed, that it behaves like a spring.

Let&#39;s look at the whip as something like a spoke on a bicycle wheel.  As the whip begins to extend further and further, you are creating something like a longer and longer spoke.  Basically, when you have a turning wheel, the circumference of the wheel moves increasingly faster depending on the length of the radius (one of the spokes).  As the radius increases, the circumference increases, and the speed at the circumference also increases. This is why when you have a good old-fashioned vinyl record playing on a record player, the speed near the center of the record can be rather slow, but the speed out at the very far edge of the record is much faster.  Again, the greater the radius, the greater the circumferential speed.  Now, getting back to the whip, the whip is like a bicycle spoke extending.  It is also being moved slightly downward, which represents a slight turn (arc), or this is like a small turning of a bicycle wheel, maybe only a few degrees or so out of the 360 degrees that make one revolution.  You really don&#39;t need to have the wheel turn very much, as long as you turn it a little bit.  Anyway, as the whip begins to &quot;unfurl&quot; or extend outward, this increases the radius.  The other movement is a slight downward movement imparted by the hand, which causes the &quot;circumferential turning&quot; (or what is like that).  You have a downward movement that is multiplied more and more the further the whip extends outwards.  That downward movement of the hand causes the &quot;circumferential turning.&quot;  I hope you can understand that what you&#39;re basically doing is creating a greater radius which is giving you a greater circumferential motion.<br><br>Let&#39;s think about the vinyl record again.  If you impart motion near the center of the record with a movement of your wrist, that record near the center will be turning at a given speed, but out at the circumference it will be turning much, much faster.  Now imagine that this &quot;unfurling&quot; whip is extending like the record to make it 12 feet or more in radius instead of just 12 inches or whatever.  However, I am also logically compelled to ask, &quot;Shouldn&#39;t the tip of the whip be slowing down and not speeding up?&quot;  Here is why (by example):  When an ice skater is spinning really fast and next extends his or her arms outward, he or she slows down.  On the other hand, by pulling in the arms, the skater speeds up, so the whip should be slowing its tip down as it extends further outward.  Another idea I am thinking about is with the whip.  Because this whip is flexing, you can send it one way and next pull back another way, so what you have is something like a combination of phenomena in effect.  One phenomenon is like the bicycle wheel or the record I discussed, where things move faster further outwards away from the center.  The other idea, though, is like this example:  If you have two cars meeting at 60 miles an hour on the highway, when they pass each other, each has a relative speed of 120 miles per hour in relation to the other.  Because you are sending the whip (tip) one way and next you can pull the handle back in the opposite direction, pretty soon you&#39;re going to have something like two different directions of motion, and if each is pretty fast, they are added together (like with the cars on the highway) to create a sudden summed up effect on the end area of the whip.  The two different directions of motion meet in the area around the end of the tip.<br><br>I hope you enjoyed reading this.

All of the kinetic energy of the mass of the whip is transferred forward, building not unlike a wave in the ocean as it travels toward shore. In trebuchets, we try to time stall points, in order to maximize energy transfer efficiency. In a whip, every point along the whip, up to the last knot before the popper becomes itself a stall point, transferring nearly all of its initial energy into the remaining mass of the whip that is still moving. <br>However, the popper seems to act almost as its own mass, and its movement is remarkably similar to the sling on a trebuchet. The last knot stalls in place, and then actually moves backward just as the popper reaches its apex. The crack happens just before this, at the exact moment the last knot stalls.<br>This stall point, where the entire whip is frozen in space, looks very nearly like the last stall point on a trebuchet, where the weight, and the arm, have transferred all of their energy into the sling just as the projectile releases.  Not only that, but since the whip is curled as it extends, this is also the moment where the popper is actually swinging in an arc around the last stall point. <br>As it tries to uncurl, part of the whip starts pulling perpendicular to the velocity direction of the tip of the popper, creating a point of centripetal force in the system as the popper &quot;whips&quot; around in an arc. Up to this point, the mass of the whip yet to uncurl was great enough that aerodynamic drag kept it traveling in a direction parallel to its length, meaning that the pull force was always directly along the length of the whip, parallel to the direction of travel. But at this point, where the mass of the whip yet to uncurl becomes low enough, the tip is able to swing out perpendicular to the direction of travel, creating centripetal force on the tip, equal to the total energy already in the system.<br>This would create a sudden, massive acceleration on the popper, pushing it beyond the sound barrier, and I&#39;m curious how far. I believe it is because of this, that the crack happens just before full extension of the whip, and also why the popper appears to get pulled along with the wave. It is actually the other way around. The wave is pulled along with the popper. <br>The whole process then reverses, of course, and the whip curls back toward the thrower.

The whip is transferring momentum downline as it unrolls and the end of the whip is the entangled air itself. When the whip propagates its energy into the air, the energy becomes unbound by the physical restraints of the solid whip material and transfers to the gaseous properties of air. The sonic boom occurs at the moment of transfer from the solid to the gaseous because there is enough energy being driven down the whip to accelerate gaseous particles beyond the speed of sound (the speed of sound itself just being a measure of resistance to waves that propagate through an elastic medium right?).<br>Is it fair to essentially say that energy is being compressed from the arm, down the decreasing diameter of the whip, remaining entangled with the material of the whip, until the end of the whip material reaches the crest of the rolling transference of momentum, then is transferred to air? When the energy is transferred to air it results in an unbinding shockwave that pulls the end of the whip out straight as it draws out the remaining entangled energy.  Compression, sonic boom/energy transference, decompression.

The tip of the whip is put under tension both by the operator and this air pocket holding the tip. You can see this in all the slowmos showing the tip being stretched out. The tip is being stretched, meaning it is under great tension. Then, the air holding onto the tip gives up grip under tension to the tip and allowing the tip to accelerate forward faster than the speed of sound. I&#39;m not sure but I believe those air bubbles you see in the wake of the tip is the air being stored at the tip being released(more like dragged down by the air around it) from the tip.

Been watching your videos for a while now and absolutely loved this one! Anyway, when you mention the car scenario add the cable...I believe there is another element that correlates with the tapper. Since a cable is consistent in diameter why would the tip gain velocity? If it is reaching a finite length then the momentum that is being exerted had less mad too move and can gain velocity. The tapper of a whip assists in the increase if velocity and I believe that is possibly why you see a shock wave happen as the whip unrolls near the end and not at the tip.

Since the end of the whip is narrow and presumably tied, when the energy transfers down to the end, the knot snaps and the energy is then spread in and through the air, into the surrounding and that produces a sound, a noise and due to the velocity with which the energy propelled outwards and dissipated in the environment, it perhaps produces a tiny shockwave. I think the foundational principle is the same as any explosion or even movement making sound, with explosions making louder sounds. I would like to learn why it is such that when I fling my arm/hand, it does not make a sound but when I take an object and do the same, it does make a sound, specially if it is a loose object.", "comment_date": "2018-12-29T10:07:28Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "hyqhyp", "comment_text": "Try shaking a wet bandana, and you can get it to crack just like a whip.

You said &quot;most researchers say... it has to speed up...&quot; I would disagree with this thought. If you have ever unrolled a spool of cord or any long material it travels faster as the roll gets smaller because the distance it needs to travel decreases as the roll gets smaller. In the instance of the whip not only does this apply but the mass is decreasing allowing for even higher speeds to be achieved. Somewhat like a multi stage rocket dropping lower stages to achieve higher speeds. So, the tip of the he whip is moving its fastest is when the last coil is unrolled and the remaining line is at its straightest and it all begins to move forward.  Another way to say it is...(at this point the potential energy stored in the coil is released (no longer holding back) and then the tip nears its maximum forward velocity. As it travels forward and it reaches the maximum (breaking the sound barrier) is when the drag is at its lowest possible point. <br>I hope this makes sense.

To break something is an event, a sonic boom is a process.  The impression I had as a kid was that the boom we would hear occurred just as the airplane accelerated past the speed of sound.  That would be an event.  Most people seem to have had a similar understanding of a sonic boom and I&#39;m sure a lot of people still believe that.  Once I came to understand sonic booms I became somewhat confused and it took me years to figure out why people called it breaking the sound barrier.  The sound barrier was broken on Oct. 14, 1947 by Chuck Yeager and no longer exists. Prior to that time many people assumed that it was impossible for manned aircraft to operate faster than mach 1 for various reasons. Thus there was presumed to be a barrier at mach 1 which already claimed at least one life (Geoffrey de Havilland, Jr.)and a number of close calls. Subsequent developments in high speed aircraft design have made it possible to operate planes routinely at supersonic speeds with little concern. The use of the expression &quot;breaking the sound barrier&quot; by news media at the time along with the concept of a sonic boom became fixed in the public mind so that when one hears a sonic boom (a rare event today) one next hears the comment &quot;that&#39;s a jet breaking the sound barrier&quot;. Nonsense, that boom (usually a distinct double boom) follows the aircraft as long as it continues at supersonic speed. Just where did it break the sound barrier?

We started with tanned hides, sliced them, shaved them, dressed the strips to precise tapers, oiled then braided them.  It took a team of two about 20 hours to make both whips.  Then we got to learn various techniques, from gently capturing things (we learned to wrap our whip around a balloon without popping it), to wrapping hard enough to break things (my favorite was sidewalk chalk, which exploded).<br><br>But the best part was learning to crack our whips.  We started by simply rolling the loop of the whip down onto the floor, where it would snap when the tip smacked down.  Then we gradually added more energy, a truly small amount at a time, until it started to crack in the air.  Large, graceful motions that finished with a crack.  Then we learned quicker moves that brought the snap a little closer in, where we learned to place it where we wanted it.  I envied the folks who were ambidextrous with their whips, because my right arm was getting ready to fall off.<br><br>We wanted to see if we could capture the motion of the whip by cracking it horizontally over sand, so a few of us took our whips to the beach and tried to crack the whip horizontally within an inch of the sand.  Almost impossible to do, but once in a while we did notice a puff of sand happening well before the whip had reached full extension, from a part of the whip not in contact with the sand.  If only...<br><br>Fast forward 25 years, and I was on the team making a camera that could take 100,000 frames per second (the Redlake HG-100K).  When the third alpha unit became the first to work at full speed, we searched for targets that would both test the camera and thrill Marketing.  Popping a balloon wasn&#39;t nearly fast enough.  I thought back to my days with the bullwhip, and we immediately went out and bought a few.  Despite dumping a zillion lumens into the field of view, nothing useful came of it.  (Clearly, using Schlieren photography and capturing the shockwave is crucial.)<br><br>What we did wind up doing was pointing the camera at the HID bulb in an Epson video projector (torn from the ceiling of a conference room), where we captured the most amazing video of the arc wandering between the electrodes within the bulb envelope.  We put a GIF of the sequence up on our website (this was before YouTube), which caused some small level of buzz online.  The next morning we received phone calls from the Japanese executives of both Epson and Panasonic (the maker of the bulb).  It turns out that arc wander was the primary factor limiting projector sharpness, so stabilizing the position of the arc was crucial to gaining any benefit from using higher-resolution LCDs.  Two days later they were in our offices for a demo, and left an awesome pile of money behind when they departed with our very first beta unit.  Their problem was that high-speed film limited the rate of innovation to one test run per day, with the film developed overnight: Our camera allowed them to do a dozen runs every day, leaping their R&amp;D further ahead of the competition.<br><br>You may have noticed I mentioned we had to go out and buy some bullwhips.  My treasured handmade bullwhip had disintegrated within a year of making it: Evidently, the tanning process used on the leather wasn&#39;t compatible with the oil we applied to it.  It sure was fun while it lasted.<br><br>Now you two have got me wanting to make another one!", "comment_date": "2018-12-29T04:04:28Z", "likes_count": 1518}, {"comment_by": "Brandon Jacky", "comment_text": "Do we realize that Dustin is literally one of the greatest contributors to science in the current era?

When the wave is traveling THROUGH the whip, you have &#39;whip&#39; mass ahead and behind the point where momentum is traveling through. That limits what the whip can do in terms of rotation/acceleration. But when all the gathered momentum reached the tip of the whip, there&#39;s only mass to one side of the whip (That will act as fulcrum), so to speak, meaning the other end is &#39;unrestricted&#39; by further mass beyond to which to transfer momentum. This means all gathered momentum must be delivered to that final tip, which will pivot about the whip&#39;s turning point, accelerating very fast with normal acceleration (causing rotation) and the only way to disipate energy at that point is only drag, as the whip can&#39;t transfer momentum to the &#39;following section&#39; because there are no more sections. So all the energy is finally turned into acceleration and the tip gets enough speed to break the sound barrier, which in turn, dissipates the quickly-gained energy.

This is of course data from aerofoils and aircraft scale aerofoils, the tip being so small would probably have an even steeper decline in drag past mach 1.0, so all of the energy it gains after breaking the sound barrier is progressively more efficient at accelerating the tip. This would of course proportionally shorten the impulse which is why the tip suddenly jumps in speed but doesn&#39;t continue accelerating at the same rate.

The difference between this and a uniform length of rope is that you gradually change the impedance of the whip as the wave moves to the tip, so no reflections of the wave occurs. Then in the end, when the speed of the whip itself is high enough, you need to impedance match to the air. This is done by increasing drag while still impedance matching the whip itself. The solution is the special tip. It is nice and puffy so the drag is high but the weight is low. This transfers a lot of energy to the air, preventing a reflection from going back up the whip. I suspect that removing the last puffy bit decreases the crack, and increases the reflection of the wave. You can also make the whip long enough to eventually achieve an impedance match to the air, as drag increases super linearly with speed. But to keep the whip short it might be best to impedance match to the air as soon as the whip is super sonic. Compare to a length of rope. If you try to crack that, the wave will come back up the rope, and no part will be particularly fast ofcourse. An even more reflective experimental setup would be with rope where the end is secured to something. The wave would come right back and even feel violent. I also suspect that this gives a framework for optimizing whips from a theoretical perspective.", "comment_date": "2018-12-28T21:04:36Z", "likes_count": 66}, {"comment_by": "Martin \u0160ediv\u00fd", "comment_text": "Destin, absolutely amazing stuff you&#39;re doing on your channel, I&#39;ve been watching for so many days that I&#39;ve gotta be the smartyest by now.

This is somewhat similar to a wheel (with only a rim) traveling all the length of the whip to its very end.<br>This &#39;wheel&#39; gets imparted a certain angular momentum from the arm and hand of the operator. As the angular momentum is conserved, the &#39;wheel&#39; needs to spin ever faster, as the string of the whip gets thinner and the ring formed by this string gets smaller in diameter (the &#39;wheel&#39; gets both smaller in diameter and lesser in mass).<br>When the &#39;wheel&#39; reaches the end of the whip, something interesting is about to happen: at some point there is not enough string left to form a full wheel (due to the lack of a stabilizing counter weight the remaining outer part of the whip string provides in earlier stages). Instead, there is only an ever shrinking section of the ring which still needs to carry (almost) all of the angular momentum the &#39;wheel&#39; had at the very start. When only a very short length of the string at the tip of the whip is left, this little piece of string needs to spin very violently around its own center to carry all that angular momentum. At that point the outer end of the string is dragged very quickly through the air (the inner end is kind of fixated by the rest of the whip), breaking the sound barrier and causing the shock wave seen in the video.<br>So, it&#39;s not only the decreasing diameter of the whip string, but also the &#39;collapse&#39; of the ring formed by the string, which causes the crack.<br>The feathered end of the string only maximizes coupling of the motion of the string end to the surrounding air, IMHO, to make the shockwave stronger and thus the crack louder. I don&#39;t think it&#39;s necessary to break the sound barrier itself (as is demonstrated in your video).", "comment_date": "2018-12-28T20:36:15Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Jared Lind", "comment_text": "Olan Rogers Battle Bear shirt!", "comment_date": "2018-12-28T20:36:13Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "\u05e0\u05d9\u05e8 \u05d1\u05df \u05d3\u05d5\u05d3", "comment_text": "Best thing in this video was seeing how happy you are to be doing what you love, now in such a greater caliber. <br>I\u2019ve been subscribed for years and that is really heart warming.

Now please let me know if i am understanding correctly-<br>As the hand stops the same momentum is transferred to the handle of the whip but since its mass is less its velocity is higher than the arm. As the handle of the whip stops it transfers the momentum to the second part put since the whip&#39;s cross-sectional area is further reduced its mass has also gone down so the velocity of the second part is increased further and this goes on until it reaches the tip whose mass is very less compared to the arm and to conserve all of this momentum the velocity goes up drastically creating a sonic boom.

I actually have an idea about the effect you mentioned at the end, where the tip looks to be pulled along as it breaks the sound barrier. I don&#39;t want to spend forever talking about it here, in case this comment is simply never read. However, I think it has to do with the compressive force within the fabric of the whip. As the curve of the whip is approaching the speed of sound, it&#39;s experiencing more and more air pressure. This compresses the fabric of the whip behind it. The based on the structure and position of the whip, this compressive force is more or less opposite to the direction of the force of the air pressure. After the air pressure dissipates, this compressive force is released, propelling the curved portion of the whip forward. I don&#39;t think this explains everything, but I almost think of it as the opposite of what happens when you drop a slinky that you&#39;ve dangled from a high place (another reference to Derek&#39;s videos).
