I think we both know you need proper rails and not just cables for this. you need a solid rail and roller system, which you could fabricate for about $100 in parts from home depot, and would probably be very useful to have for motion-based projects anyway.  it&#39;s a great way to make sure a fast moving object moves across the high-speed camera frame properly.<br><br>3: as others have mentioned, there was a serious lack of safety concern here, besides the fact that you were making a rocket saw. <br>    A: no eye protection.<br>    B: fingers waaaaay too close to a spinning blade at <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZtsX0gLrxo&amp;t=2m46s\">2:46</a><br>    C: there was no real need for your running jump at <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZtsX0gLrxo&amp;t=2m53s\">2:53</a> . slow down and be careful. you&#39;re dealing with things that could very easily hurt you.<br>    D: no &quot;don&#39;t try this at home&quot; disclaimer.  come on, you&#39;re a professional at this stuff, and you KNOW someone&#39;s going to try this now.<br><br>4: IT&#39;S NOT SCIENCE IF YOU DON&#39;T DOCUMENT YOUR FINDINGS! The edited entertainment-style video does not count as documenting your findings. and regardless of whether you planned to feed the computer the data, you still should have left it with the sensor array and showed us what happened on impact as far as the motion sensors.
