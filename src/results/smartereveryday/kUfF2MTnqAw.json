A lot of people think altitude based hypoxia is caused by a lack of oxygen at higher altitudes. That is just a small part of it. Even if you are breathing 100% oxygen it\u2019s not enough at around 35000 to 37000 ft. The reason hypoxia occurs at altitude is because the transfer of oxygen to the hemoglobin in your blood occurs due to pressure differences. In your lungs, the partial pressure of water vapour and co2 is almost constant at all altitudes, so when the total pressure drops, the partial pressure of oxygen (and nitrogen) drops. When the partial pressure of oxygen drops too low, no oxygen transfer can happen, and the hemoglobin does not pick up new oxygen molecules, no matter how many oxygen molecules that are floating around in your lungs. That\u2019s why oxygen masks for pilots are delivered with automatic over pressure that forces the air into your lungs, depending on cabin altitude. For passengers, however, it is expected that they put on their masks, and maybe pass out on the way down, but the aircraft will descend below 35000 feet quickly if the pilots does their job, and the passengers will quicken rather quickly once getting lower. Also, most airliners can fly above 40000 feet. At those altitudes you have about 3 to 7 seconds of useful consciousness if you get a rapid or instant decompression, which again, is why it is crucial to get on your oxygen mask quickly. As you saw in the short clip he showed, you will get mist forming as the air pressure decreases and can no longer hold the moisture. You will have around 1 second of blindness due to the mist and a couple of seconds of confusion, so not a lot of time to get the mask on before you pass out.", "comment_date": "2020-03-08T15:05:39Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Silencer Martinez", "comment_text": "I would love to do that how can I do it", "comment_date": "2020-03-08T11:23:38Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "epicorange", "comment_text": "He&#39;s never going to do that again", "comment_date": "2020-03-07T17:05:33Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Simpson", "comment_text": "why was i so incredibly scared for your life? my heart is still racing about a minute after watching this, even though this video was made 4 years ago, you had people in there monitoring and helping you, and you made the voice overs, there was absolutely no reason for me to worry.", "comment_date": "2020-03-07T16:11:33Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Route 66 Flyer", "comment_text": "I went through training in the Air Force in 1963, we were given a clipboard and told to start writing our name as we went up to 35K.

The physiology behind the &quot;exit bag&quot; is pretty simple: inspiring an inert gas such as helium or nitrogen displaces oxygen and prevents it entering circulation, thus inducing hypoxia. During said time the person will experience no respiratory distress (or the struggling that is associated with suffocation) because there is no residual build up of CO2, which in turn means the body&#39;s chemoreceptors do not induce changes in ventilation to offset the hypoxia. Dying, either intentionally or accidentally, via the inspiration of an inert gas and hypoxia is completely pain free and peaceful.

How does this differ from just holding your breath at sea level? If I hold my breath for 1 minute, I will not get hypoxia right? Why it happens at high altitude?<br>Is it that when you hold your breath there is relatively oxygen rich air in your lungs that you keep on using, but when you are in a depressurized cabin, the high pressure air escapes your lungs and you are left with thinner air that you keep on breathing. Breathing helps to get more oxygen into your brain, but not quickly enough to compensate the oxygen you are using.

So im on the way to his house and he grabs the wheel and luckily we dont crash but i park and yell at him what are you thinking dude! And he says after taking a long drag on his can that he thought we all jumped out the car and left him to crash. Then he threw up took a hit and passed out and started drooling.

Excess oxygen becomes dissolved into the blood stream, even after hemoglobin is fully saturated (that was the &quot;PulseOx&quot; number on his finger, how saturated his hemoglobin was with oxygen). Also his lungs became full of nearly 100% oxygen instead of the normal 21% oxygen, so even though he continued to respire there is a functional reserve in the lung that does not get exchanged with every breath, and oxygen can continue to be transported into the blood stream at higher levels. In medicine we use these concepts in emergency situations. The benefit of pre-oxygenation is even more pronounced when respiration is temporarily stopped for procedures like endotracheal intubation.", "comment_date": "2019-04-04T17:50:33Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Typhlosion Br", "comment_text": "Seriously NASA... get yourself a better headset microphone...", "comment_date": "2019-04-03T23:31:18Z", "likes_count": 67}, {"comment_by": "PackuMira", "comment_text": "I really hope Susan got that Hamburger<br>her nonchalant &quot;copy&quot; was really funny to me ^^", "comment_date": "2019-04-03T16:22:06Z", "likes_count": 177}, {"comment_by": "Raph", "comment_text": "USA, put your mask on first", "comment_date": "2019-04-03T15:23:31Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Scott Minium", "comment_text": "So, why can&#39;t you hold your breath for 45 seconds at 35000 feet?", "comment_date": "2019-04-03T01:50:11Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Syncros", "comment_text": "Solid video", "comment_date": "2019-04-03T00:34:54Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Danny Stratyys", "comment_text": "Wonderful demonstration of how important O2 is from a medical perspective as well!

Drs believe my Central sleep apnea is related to a head trauma I sustained and further brain damage has occurred while sleeping / not breathing. some Stroke victims suffer from central sleep apnea.  others would be quadriplegics or neck injuries who have lost neurological impulses to the diaphragm and are on a ventilator.   if you wake up gasping for air or see someone stop breathing when they sleep get help. have a sleep study done.", "comment_date": "2018-08-12T08:05:03Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Frank Perrotte", "comment_text": "kinda scary now knowing how quick and easy it is to acquire hypoxia. but I am glad you showed the significance I will definitely remember this next time I fly. thank you I am now smarter because of it. \ud83d\udc4d", "comment_date": "2018-08-12T07:13:33Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Mediocre", "comment_text": "&quot;You will die&quot; &quot;pfft I dont wanna die *wink&quot; spoken like a true warrior", "comment_date": "2018-08-12T06:12:23Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Nate One", "comment_text": "Wow...

You may still feel the effects of hypoxia for a moment as a passenger since those masks only deliver 100% non-pressurized O2.<br>So always fix your mask first, then help others. And you may still suffer some effects of hypoxia if at altitude that would require pressurized O2.<br><br>The concept is that the pilot will immediately descend to altitude that doesn&#39;t need pressurized O2 (below 40,000 MSL), and eventually below 14,000/12,000 MSL where supplemental O2 shouldn&#39;t be required by the general population.<br><br>Another big point: hypoxia at altitude is not the same as holding your breath.  <br><br>The reduced pressure causes all gasses to expand, which includes O2 in your blood and organs to come out of solution faster than usual; like opening a fizzy drink; except that&#39;s O2 fizzing out of your body very quickly.  Holding your breath won&#39;t help you with anything, in fact it will only make things worse.<br>Amount of time of useful consciousness decrease per altitude and most airlines cruise at 30,000 up to 44,000 MSL:   <br>FL250 (25,000 ft; 7,600 m) 3 to 6 minutes<br>FL280 (28,000 ft; 8,550 m) 2.5 to 3 minutes<br>FL300 (30,000 ft; 9,150 m) 1 to 3 minutes<br>FL350 (35,000 ft; 10,650 m) 30 secs to 1 minute<br>FL400 (40,000 ft; 12,200 m) 15 to 20 seconds<br>FL430 (43,000 ft; 13,100 m) 9 to 15 seconds<br>FL500 (50,000 ft; 15,250 m) 6 to 9 seconds<br><br>You literally have seconds in many cases.<br><br>Rapid decompression event, don&#39;t try to hold your breath or inhale when you hear the boom; either can tear your lungs, and can result in death.

Same way you can easily die from too many martinis, you can die from nitrogen narcosis, especially since severe intoxication at hundreds feet under the sea is not exactly conducive to safe decision-making. Depending on how skilled you are, some guys can work through a mild degree of narc, but once you go too far, there&#39;s no going back.

I&#39;m pretty sure that room wasn&#39;t actually banking, unless it was on hydraulic legs or something that weren&#39;t visible, and why would a &quot;vent&quot; help that anyway? Unless you edited out a big chunk of video just before that, the thing &quot;you guys were talking about&quot; was that everyone was farting from the dropping pressure. Which makes it sound as though he&#39;s saying that they&#39;re going to vent the chamber a bit to get rid of some of the, uh, more noxious gases before you had to take your masks off. That would make &quot;angle of bank&quot; some obscure astronaut euphemism for breaking wind. Is it? I mean, as well as the normal meaning of the phrase. Sorry so long, but I&#39;m thinking if I just wrote, &quot;Hey when he says &#39;angle of bank&#39; does he mean farts?&quot; no one would think I was serious.

So you are saying at 40 000 feet, you got around 10 seconds of consciousness. How is that possible while I can hold my breath for a minute easily? I am a jiu jitsu practitioner, and the 10 seconds almost looks like a blood choke (constriction of the carotid arteries to cut the blood supply to the brain, making your opponent pass out literally in seconds). Similarly to the Hypoxia test you did, when you release the choke, the brains gets its access to oxygen again, and the guy wakes up within a few seconds.<br><br>So I was wondering how 10 seconds is possible while the blood keeps going to the brain? I just did a quick test while typing this. I emptied my lungs completely and then started a timer. Turns out I can avoid breathing for 25 seconds quite easily on empty lungs. could probably go 30 or 35 seconds if I had been willing to suffer a bit more lol. So how is 10 seconds possible? do you loose oxygen through your skin in a depressurized environment?

I have a couple of questions/comments though.<br><br>Firstly I would like to point out that I in no way want to question the severity of the message of Your video, and becoming unconscious certainly is something You would want to avoid.<br>That being said  I personally highly doubt that You would have died or even taken any &quot;serious damage&quot; if You had fallen unconscious.<br>And I simply ground my assumption on the &quot;Extremely well controlled environment&quot; You were in at the time of the &quot;self inflicted emergency&quot;.<br> You most certainly would have been put under oxygen, and given assisted respiration and resuscitation had that been necessary. And given that You were &quot;simply oxygen depleted&quot; and You are a &quot;healthy Young specimen&quot; I believe that a &quot;full recovery&quot; would be the norm (of course there are always the outliers, so it&#39;s never without risk) .<br><br>Secondly, as far as I understand it You have no recollection of the event where You were &quot;on the brink&quot;, and my guess is that it will come back to You possibly &quot;dimly&quot; and somewhat fragmented but still. And my grounds for saying this is that I myself was rescued from drowning in a diving incident. And for a period after the event  my memories of the 30 last seconds before blackout  were absolutely blank. How ever as time passed my memories started to come back, although not &quot;in full&quot; and as &quot;clear&quot; as if I had been fully alert at the &quot;event&quot;, after all I was more or less unCONCIOUS as my brain registered them.<br><br>Again thanks for another fantastic video.<br>Best regards MR", "comment_date": "2016-07-24T15:44:38Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "TheJapanChannelDcom", "comment_text": "Smarter than 99.9% of the Youtube &quot;vloggers&quot;, that is a certainty.", "comment_date": "2016-07-24T15:37:16Z", "likes_count": 3}, {"comment_by": "PinkChucky15", "comment_text": "Excellent video, Destin :-)", "comment_date": "2016-07-24T15:28:37Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "RD Banks", "comment_text": "One of your best videos, I loved your message at the end :)", "comment_date": "2016-07-24T15:28:35Z", "likes_count": 2}, {"comment_by": "Pvk Jhilk", "comment_text": "they say its the most humane way to administer the death penalyt, but then again they also they dont deserve a humane death", "comment_date": "2016-07-24T15:28:15Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "ninja_padeiro", "comment_text": "You looked really helpless on those last seconds.

To me it does, but I&#39;m sure to people who do not know the range of effects, they&#39;ll experience the terror of not knowing and loosing control. Under the 56% SaO2 the body faints, shuts down the whole body and major organs and &#39;prioritises&#39; brain and heart. Those can keep functioning in this lower state for about 4-5 minutes before permanent damage start occurring. In cold water it may be longer. Still it&#39;s very important a fainted person gets help immediately. The sooner O2 gets into the person&#39;s bloodstream and brain, the shorter the recovery time is. Freedivers learn how and why in freediver courses. If you ever see a person faint in the pool make sure to bring them up, hold them up face above the water, clear the face and airways, give mouth to mouth. If you&#39;re quick the victem will come around quickly, often with some body spasms followed by surprise, bewilderment, anger as to why you&#39;re holding them up. They&#39;ll have no recollection as to what happened. Tell them to breath, relax, and then tell them what happened and help them to get out of the pool. In freediving competitions BO victems often get pure O2 for a few minutes to help speedy recovery. Under water faint victims must see a doctor to check for &#39;second drowning&#39;. They need to take a day rest and drink, eat and sleep well, no breath-holds. A freediver cannot rescue himself from a BO. Most freedivers never felt a BO coming. Never freedive alone.

Would they not last that long if they were to breathe the low oxygen air? I ask because would breathing cause you to last LESS time than you would if you were to hold your breathe because of the low partial pressure of oxygen at that altitude actually siphoning oxygen OUT of your blood?

During my first sleep study, I had 300 apneas and my blood oxygen level dropped to 72% over the course of 4 hours.<br><br>Getting married saved my life.  My wife didn&#39;t sleep the first few months of our marriage due to me snoring/gasping for air.  This led to visiting an ENT who referred me to a sleep specialist.  I also had other symptoms like daytime drowsiness, dizziness, numbness/tingling in my extremities, and general confusion when waking up.  I generally felt like I was paralyzed when first waking up.  Perhaps the worst symptom was night terrors.  It was basically my brain forcing me to wake up because I was dying.<br><br>After a year of treatment I feel like a new man.  I wake up feeling refreshed, and I&#39;m able to concentrate better at work.  I&#39;ve also lost 30 lbs (I was slightly overweight before), and my blood pressure has started to return to normal.

I found it interesting the difference in how you can simulate high altitude environments. You used a Hypobaric Chamber to change the partial pressure of the atmosphere because the percent of Oxogen in the atmosphere never changes just the amount of it due to the loss of pressure. I am a student at Embry Riddle Aeronautical University, and here we use a Normabaric chamber to simulate high altitudes up to FL300. The Normabaric chamber uses machines called Oxogen scrubbers that reduces the amount of Oxogen in a closed environment without having to change the pressure. This makes it less expensive and safer since there is no change in atmospheric pressure, there is no danger of ear or sinus blocks, trapped gas, or decompression sickness.

That takes about 30 seconds. You might be unconscious by then, but the brain can handle up to about 4 minutes of zero oxygen (no pulse, basically) before you start to get brain damage, so to be perfectly honest the oxygen masks in airplanes are pretty much gimmicks, they are there to make you feel safe, but the don&#39;t really make a difference in whether you live or die. The pilots, however, obviously have to have killer reflexes when it comes to getting their masks on in case of an explosive decompression. They also have proper oxygen tanks with proper regulators as opposed to the chemical oxygen reactors (basically a can with two chemicals that release oxygen (and lots of heat, actually) when combined (you combine them when you yank the masks down from their elevated position)) used for the passengers. Pilots tank provides oxygen for probably in excess of an hour, while the passengers reactors only run for a few minutes before they run out. It&#39;s just for show, just a gimmick to make people feel safe.<br>&quot;But what happens if they can&#39;t descend right away&quot; you ask. Well, on the rare occasion that there is for example a Mount Everest or similar obstacle underneath, that&#39;s actually where the masks might make a difference. However, bare in mind that you usually hurl along at 8-900 km/h, so any such obstacle will have passed really quickly, and that airplanes actually have the ability to turn.", "comment_date": "2016-07-22T16:25:04Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "uber808", "comment_text": "Is it similar to nitrogen narcosis?

Hopefully this will help your understanding of altitude induced hypoxia. <br><br>Our entire atmosphere from the surface to 100 km up consists of the same percentage of the main elements - O2, N2, Argon, etc... So you do not have any &quot;less&quot; oxygen at 25,000 ft than you do at sea level. What is different is the partial pressure of oxygen. <br><br>Consider when you are at the bottom of the pool. You have the pressure of the column of water above you due to the Earth&#39;s gravitational force of the water. Air can and does often acts like a fluid... as it does for this example. Consider that at sea level you have 100 km of air in a column above you. This &quot;pressure&quot; helps to &quot;force&quot; oxygen into our lungs. <br><br>Consider pressurized aircraft which can fly in the high altitudes. These aircraft do not have any oxygen bottles or oxygen generators for their flights (only for emergencies). The cabins are pressurized to increase to make the partial pressure of oxygen breathable, by increasing the pressure... they aren&#39;t adding &quot;air /  oxygen&quot; to the cabin. Likewise you experienced the opposite when they lowered the pressure in the atmospheric chamber to experience a lower partial pressure of oxygen in your lungs. Aircraft pull air from the outside, pressurizing it, and then sending it to the cabin. At the same time there is an outflow valve which lets out air and also helps to regulate the pressure in the cabin. Typical cabin pressures are set to a similar pressure you&#39;d experience at 8000 ft above the ground. The oxygen carried aboard these aircraft is for when the pressurization systems fail and they can no longer maintain that partial pressure.", "comment_date": "2016-07-22T15:53:41Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Wong Lucus", "comment_text": "More space vid!
