I want to be able to accurately discern truth in all that I do, so the techniques that Katy taught me here were super helpful.  I hope you are able to use them as well.  MediaWise has been using the hashtag <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23IsThisLegit\">#IsThisLegit</a> across all social media, so tag them on Insta or Twitter (Where a lot of misinformation happens) and they&#39;ll get a team to help you figure it out.  Also, the upcoming series I&#39;m doing on Algorithmic Manipulation is going to be a very hardcore look into the inner workings of YouTube, Twitter, and Facebook.  I hope you&#39;ll subscribe (<a href=\"http://bit.ly/Subscribe2SED\">http://bit.ly/Subscribe2SED</a> ) and consider watching this 3 part series with me.  I&#39;ve never done a series like this, so I hope you find it to be as fascinating as I have while doing the research.  Thank you very much for watching my internets.

I also see the other side of people who say that being a cop requires alot of complex moral decisions humans aren&#39;t good at making, if someone goes to a crowd and points a gun at them, a cop will probably have to shoot or theyre putting the crowds life as risk, and if someone comes at a cop with a gun or knife, its fair to have them feel there lifes more important then there job and shoot the person. still its messy and dark and there is A LOT of grey area and little solututions that feel good. of course i filtered out the bad arguments on both sides, and I support blm in trying to find a soultion to this very complex problem. but i feel if i just went with the news quicktake I wouldn&#39;t actaully understand the problem at all, and thats why i hate the news, if you watch a 10 min infomational vid on a problem after the 10 min you expect to understand the problem arguments and soultions, but you can watch the news for hours and learn / understand nothing only feeling scared and angry while being  hyperfocused and unreasonable", "comment_date": "2020-12-07T03:19:11Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "U.S. Militia", "comment_text": "Surely with your clearance you took a few classes like how to talk to the media.

Example, when they said that Trump would destroy the US Economy and compare it to what really happened, then you know that the authors that wrote that, and wrote other articles based on it, are not real journalists.  Or how about the people that said that parts of Europe would be under water by 2020 due to climate change.  Same thing.  Mainstream media says Keto is dangerous, may not be good for everyone, etc etc.  Yet almost everyone who has tried it loses weight fast, feels better and gets off many medications.  I had to try Keto for myself to see what all the hubub was about.  I figured that I&#39;m only going to eat more of one type of food (good fats) and very little of another type of food (carbs).  Food that anyone can buy at your nearest grocery store.  Nothing that requires a license or a prescription, so what could be the big harm?  Did it for three months and then went to the VA for a follow up check up.  My doctor was amazed how fast I lost weight, how my triglycerides had plummeted for the first time in a long time and how for being a 45 year old hispanic, my blood pressure was great! (not sure if that was trying to imply something, but oh well)  However, she wasn&#39;t 100% sure I should be consuming all that fat including lots of eggs and bacon. (go figure)  So, all the stories posted online by regular people, who tried it and got good results and gave good common sense opinions were more trustworthy that a mainstream media that is HEAVILY SPONSORED BY PHARMACEUTICAL COMPANIES.

Tempo makes it hard for the opponent to adequately adapt to the\r<br>fast changing situation. It is not absolute speed that counts; it is the relative tempo or a variety\r<br>in rhythm that counts. The OODA speed is a parameter to vary with for it is also a pattern\r<br>one can give away.

A. S. HERLONG, JR. OF FLORIDA<br>IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES<br><br>Thursday, January 10, 1963<br><br>Mr. HERLONG. Mr. Speaker, Mrs. Patricia Nordman of De Land, Fla., is an ardent and articulate opponent of communism, and until recently published the De Land Courier, which she dedicated to the purpose of alerting the public to the dangers of communism in America.<br><br>At Mrs. Nordman\u2019s request, I include in the RECORD, under unanimous consent, the following \u201cCurrent Communist Goals,\u201d which she identifies as an excerpt from \u201cThe Naked Communist,\u201d by Cleon Skousen:<br><br>U. S. Congressional Seal[From \u201cThe Naked Communist,\u201d by Cleon Skousen]<br><br>CURRENT COMMUNIST GOALS<br>1. U.S. acceptance of coexistence as the only alternative to atomic war.<br>2. U.S. willingness to capitulate in preference to engaging in atomic war.<br>3. Develop the illusion that total disarmament [by] the United States would be a demonstration of moral strength.<br>4. Permit free trade between all nations regardless of Communist affiliation and regardless of whether or not items could be used for war.<br>5. Extension of long-term loans to Russia and Soviet satellites.<br>6. Provide American aid to all nations regardless of Communist domination.<br>7. Grant recognition of Red China. Admission of Red China to the U.N.<br>8. Set up East and West Germany as separate states in spite of Khrushchev\u2019s promise in 1955 to settle the German question by free elections under supervision of the U.N.<br>9. Prolong the conferences to ban atomic tests because the United States has agreed to suspend tests as long as negotiations are in progress.<br>10. Allow all Soviet satellites individual representation in the U.N.<br>11. Promote the U.N. as the only hope for mankind. If its charter is rewritten, demand that it be set up as a one-world government with its own independent armed forces. (Some Communist leaders believe the world can be taken over as easily by the U.N. as by Moscow. Sometimes these two centers compete with each other as they are now doing in the Congo.)<br>12. Resist any attempt to outlaw the Communist Party.<br>13. Do away with all loyalty oaths.<br>14. Continue giving Russia access to the U.S. Patent Office.<br>15. Capture one or both of the political parties in the United States.<br>16. Use technical decisions of the courts to weaken basic American institutions by claiming their activities violate civil rights.<br>17. Get control of the schools. Use them as transmission belts for socialism and current Communist propaganda. Soften the curriculum. Get control of teachers\u2019 associations. Put the party line in textbooks.<br>18. Gain control of all student newspapers.<br>19. Use student riots to foment public protests against programs or organizations which are under Communist attack.<br>20. Infiltrate the press. Get control of book-review assignments, editorial writing, policymaking positions.<br>21. Gain control of key positions in radio, TV, and motion pictures.<br>22. Continue discrediting American culture by degrading all forms of artistic expression. An American Communist cell was told to \u201celiminate all good sculpture from parks and buildings, substitute shapeless, awkward and meaningless forms.\u201d<br>23. Control art critics and directors of art museums. \u201cOur plan is to promote ugliness, repulsive, meaningless art.\u201d<br>24. Eliminate all laws governing obscenity by calling them \u201ccensorship\u201d and a violation of free speech and free press.<br>25. Break down cultural standards of morality by promoting pornography and obscenity in books, magazines, motion pictures, radio, and TV.<br>26. Present homosexuality, degeneracy and promiscuity as \u201cnormal, natural, healthy.\u201d<br>27. Infiltrate the churches and replace revealed religion with \u201csocial\u201d religion. Discredit the Bible and emphasize the need for intellectual maturity which does not need a \u201creligious crutch.\u201d<br>28. Eliminate prayer or any phase of religious expression in the schools on the ground that it violates the principle of \u201cseparation of church and state.\u201d<br>29. Discredit the American Constitution by calling it inadequate, old-fashioned, out of step with modern needs, a hindrance to cooperation between nations on a worldwide basis.<br>30. Discredit the American Founding Fathers. Present them as selfish aristocrats who had no concern for the \u201ccommon man.\u201d<br>31. Belittle all forms of American culture and discourage the teaching of American history on the ground that it was only a minor part of the \u201cbig picture.\u201d Give more emphasis to Russian history since the Communists took over.<br>32. Support any socialist movement to give centralized control over any part of the culture\u2013education, social agencies, welfare programs, mental health clinics, etc.<br>33. Eliminate all laws or procedures which interfere with the operation of the Communist apparatus.<br>34. Eliminate the House Committee on Un-American Activities.<br>35. Discredit and eventually dismantle the FBI.<br>36. Infiltrate and gain control of more unions.<br>37. Infiltrate and gain control of big business.<br>38. Transfer some of the powers of arrest from the police to social agencies. Treat all behavioral problems as psychiatric disorders which no one but psychiatrists can understand [or treat].<br>39. Dominate the psychiatric profession and use mental health laws as a means of gaining coercive control over those who oppose Communist goals.<br>40. Discredit the family as an institution. Encourage promiscuity and easy divorce.<br>41. Emphasize the need to raise children away from the negative influence of parents. Attribute prejudices, mental blocks and retarding of children to suppressive influence of parents.<br>42. Create the impression that violence and insurrection are legitimate aspects of the American tradition; that students and special-interest groups should rise up and use [\u201c]united force[\u201c] to solve economic, political or social problems.<br>43. Overthrow all colonial governments before native populations are ready for self-government.<br>44. Internationalize the Panama Canal.<br>45. Repeal the Connally reservation so the United States cannot prevent the World Court<br><br>You may not find these 45 Communist Goals on the Web in it\u2019s original form because in 1963 there were no digitized documents. You will find web sites that have copied them as I have. Call your local library and you can obtain an original copy there. Or ask your U. S. Congressional Member.

You&#39;re an intelligent guy, but this isn&#39;t your area of expertise or interest. It would then be easy to trick you, you&#39;ve just told us how. <br>btw your stated approach is something that &#39;journalism&#39; started doing about thirty years ago, it does sound easonable: let both sides have an equal say, and then let the readers or viewers decide.  Real journalism is to report the most important story the way your diligent reporting says is true and let the chips fall where they may.  <br>Don Winslow is a writer, I&#39;ve read most of his books. He is probably qualified to comment on Woodward and Bernstein.  (I&#39;m surprised you had no idea who they were. I can name many reporters who had an impact before I was born.)  Winslow just published the third book of his trilogy  The Border,  on the Mexican drug cartels and the American drug problem; it&#39;s well researched, well written and &#39;truthful.&#39; ( He writes fiction but I&#39;m sure he can cite real examples of every character and incident in his drug trilogy.) <br>And if I saw the Don Winslow tweet, would I re-tweet it? No. Do I agree with Don Winslow and his Tweet. Yes. But the news isn&#39;t a popularity contest, that&#39;s all re-tweeting is. What does it actually accomplish? (David Mamet once said, &quot;A standing ovation is the easiest thing to get, all you have to do is appeal to the deepest held prejudices of your audience. But get them to gasp or laugh, that takes work.&quot;)<br>And why re-tweet something you know almost nothing about? The best response upon finding out that these are the reporters who investigated corruption in the Nixon administration leading to the resignation of President Nixon...Forget about retweeting, go read a couple of books on it. President Nixon was accused of obstruction of justice, tampering with our elections, some financial misconduct... Is this currently relevant? What do you think?  Knowing the history makes the current news far more interesting. Who was the more liberal president: Democrat Obama or Republican Nixon? <br><br>\u00a0The best thing you can do is read books (get Audible and listen to them). You will never learn much from news feeds, or Twitter (I had it for about two weeks, I started with NASA, Eddie Izzard (a comedian) and Susan Orlean (a writer I like), I never thought that NASA could be boring, their tweets were hollow, Eddie Izzard kept promoting friends and causes, well, okay.... but really? I was hoping he&#39;d be funny, and Susan Orlean just kept tweeting about her cats. I got rid of Twitter. )  <br><br>The global warming photo with the changed date.  Well done! You got that right. <br><br>John Boyd. There&#39;s a terrific biography on him and his battles with military bureaucracy. In response to the F-15 he countered with the F-16. Much cheaper to build and operate,  just as effective.  He had a terrific method of entering a debate (Congressional military allocations, etc). He would start by using only the data and the arguments of the people supporting the project he opposed. To prepare he&#39;d go over all the numbers,  as an engineer (Boyd was one) you&#39;d really enjoy this book. One plane that was being over-promoted he ran the numbers and figured out that if the numbers being submitted were true, then the plane&#39;s wings had positive lift numbers when velocity was zero. When he was told about the F-111 proposal, configurable wings, he accurately predicted the added weight, lost speed and range caused by the hinge. <br><br>You never said, &#39;books&#39; (that&#39;s okay, it&#39;s my hobbyhorse, not yours) Reading, even reading fiction, develops your mind like nothing else (except maybe painful experience). Hopefully some of my nonsense here is proof. Go back in the NYTimes and look at the front page articles written by Judith Miller about Weapons of Mass Destruction in Iraq prior to the US Invasion in 2003. How many paragraphs did it take you to either trust or begin to mistrust the story? Life and history and the news are really really complicated, but with experience, lots of reading and thinking, some things will just seem obvious--and you can make money from them. You have to approach the news with your own questions. Example: I&#39;m not real fond of our current president, a couple of months ago I read that the Democratic majority Congress may be able to subpoena his taxes and make them public. I don&#39;t know if they can actually do this, but if they can, the important first question is, Why haven&#39;t they done it already? If they can but haven&#39;t... then maybe the president and his party haven&#39;t been winning elections so much as the Democrats have been losing them. Should I next start speculating what might be in those tax records? What would be the point? It&#39;s idle speculation until there&#39;s information to speculate on. <br><br>Sorry to be such a crank. I&#39;m killing a lot of time but I hope I&#39;m not wasting anyone else&#39;s. I like that these comments scroll into oblivion. And don&#39;t worry, most people were just as naive back then as they are now. (In 1972  I got a lot of heat for opposing Nixon and the War, by 1974 and his resignation it was hard to find anyone who would admit having voted for him.  Know what&#39;s scary?

I put them on 1.5x speed &amp; go about doing chores. Right now I am disabled and home, so have the time to watch original videos and look around, but it takes a lot of effort.  Eventually those won&#39;t be trustworthy either when ability to edit video with fake faces and faked voices becomes more common. Photos are tricky because they can be edited and put out as real. -- Another problem is the news people won&#39;t acknowledge their bias. They don&#39;t just report facts, but they twist things around. Just the choice of words by author can alter how you feel about an article. &quot;Peacemaker&quot; vs &quot;missile&quot; was an old example from past. I&#39;m pretty good at searching and skimming, but it is futile for the most part. I don&#39;t have any power anyway, so why do I even try or bother. Sigh! <br><br>I also use foreign news sources, then use Google Translate for different languages. You can get a wider perspective. -- It is also much easier to scan around for information on-line if you use a desktop vs a mobile phone. The mobile phone feed is just so restrictive that you aren&#39;t going to be able to hop around and compare sources. If you use a desktop then you can open multiple tabs and open videos and then scan through a video or turn on the CC if possible. Look for transcripts of videos to skim vs watch video. Anyway... it takes time and effort and also being aware of your own bias. I know I&#39;m biased towards conservative. <br><br>Well, glad others are pondering this too.

This is an often overlooked problem. For example, your view of how much crime there is or how much you are personally at risk, is typically built up over time based on stories you hear. But the reality is that actual crime statistics and threats bear little or no relation to the frequency of stories in the news - even when those stories are individually 100% accurate. This is because only a tiny fraction of actual crime events ever get reported. This bias applies to a very large proportion of our world view, how we view the country, economic models, political systems etc. Just spend some time watching news sources from a completely different country and culture and you will realize just how much your views are shaped by the culture of the news even when the actual stories are factually accurate.<br>As for your statement that there are good news sources out there, I don&#39;t know of any, do you? Every one I have tried is biased in some way. The best sources I have found are NOT news sources but channels like yours that cover a particular topic. One of the biggest problems with the media today is the funding model means they either are primarily interested in views (for which factual reporting is a detriment not a benefit) or they are funded for political reasons - which means there will be propaganda - or most often, both of the above.

That and the issue of scooping. In an environment wherein universities now require academics to publish a large minimum number (~6+) of papers per academic year just to keep their job for the next year, there has been a SIGNIFICANT rise in fraud taking place in the biological and chemical sciences and no one is talking about it and the \u201ccivilian\u201d population at large who places so much faith in science do not know this is happening and are often believing sometimes sensationalized media stories about \u201cdiscoveries\u201d that have not actually been verified by any sources outside the potentially biased laboratory in which these experiments were done. Sometimes bias makes it into science by accident but it has become extremely noticeable that the more nefarious injection of bias is increasing. <br><br>In short, let\u2019s have a discussion about the deeply flawed present peer-review system wherein experiments aren\u2019t even repeated by a second or third source for veracity. If repeatability is key then we should perhaps have an organization that hires organic/synthetic chemists, biochemist, analytical and physical chemists, cellular/molecular biologists, etc etc whose sole purpose is to repeat experimentation submitted for publication. In organic synthesis I have encountered papers which I have drawn upon and found that their product was absolutely not what they claimed, whether it was an error in their analysis of their NMR, IR and Mass Spec spectrograph(s) or improper experimental methodology no one can know but let\u2019s be honest and ask WHY we don\u2019t see papers getting published in journals that have a negative outcome to the hypothesis after experimentation, that is just as important to discovery and science; although it\u2019s rarely about discovery anymore, it\u2019s all about money/funding,fighting for tenure positions nowadays, science has become \u201cfor sale\u201d often to the highest bidder, whether you are contracted by a pharmaceutical giant or local CRO or government program or in some cases even an agency whose political agenda depends on a VERY specific outcome.....<br><br>Also, let\u2019s stop coming up with fantasies and fairytales that have no empirical evidence to support that assertion and stick to data driven science.....

If you start with skepticism of a story that popular culture\u00a0instantly sees as true, you are looked down upon and your skepticism is seen as a negative against you. Case in point is the recent Jessie Smollett story, something didn&#39;t add up\u00a0with the initial reported events of that story and yet many of those on the left, who jumped instantly on the bandwagon of belief, were extremely critical of those who were skeptical and equated their skepticism with insensitivity and even racism.

Case in point: I once noted to a friend that President Obama had been reversed UNANIMOUSLY by the Supreme Court 13 times, a stunning statistic since the Supreme Court hardly ever does anything unanimously. He called that &quot;fake news,&quot; we went back and forth, and eventually verified the statistic. But what struck me is that he is an extremely well-read and intelligent person. He spends hours every day making sure he&#39;s fully informed. But his news sources (things like the NY Times and the Washington Post) weren&#39;t keeping a tally of Obama reversals and displaying them prominently, but mine were. Our assessments of President Obama were totally different, even though we both were getting true facts. I&#39;m curious to know what you, or the Poynter Institute, recommends to solve that problem. (Incidentally, there is a good response to this &quot;fact,&quot; namely that several of the cases originated under President Bush, and one can&#39;t fairly tag Obama with all of them. The point is, though, that one has to have the fact in order to fairly evaluate it, something that occurs through some sources but not others.)", "comment_date": "2019-03-18T12:05:08Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Jinzouningen Juunanagou", "comment_text": "blacklist all mainstream media on your news feeds. ezpz no more fake news.", "comment_date": "2019-03-18T12:04:22Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "The Sapien", "comment_text": "This is the naive approach.", "comment_date": "2019-03-18T12:04:16Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Andy1dude", "comment_text": "But how do I know if Destin is legit?

Information has become a weapon and I feel that the differentiation you are mentioning here makes a huge difference and leads to less conflict and more fact based discussions. Following your argumentation, only two questions rose in me: 1. Taking a source as one important thing to determine between truth and fake would exclude the individual concept and target of an individual. Just because it has proven in the past to be reliable, doesn&#39;t necessarily mean it has to be in the future. Even formerly reliable sources give up under the current pressure and reduce their thrive for solid research. 2. Searching only with Google ignores Google&#39;s political agenda. The differences in various search engines show that also Google manipulates according to it&#39;s individual agenda (and search algorithms).

You would think dam you must have supported something really bad ... nope ... I argued with them that mobile radio waves are safe while they claimed they are extremely dangerous with fake or bad research taken out of context ... I tried to correct them in there comment field because that stuff is something i know allot of especially because of my education.<br><br>I explained when what becomes dangerous and how much energy you need to put into it .. i explained the scientific facts and connected together both biologi and electronic science to show mobiles are most likely safe because there is no sign that they harm us even after so many years ... But i also said when something get dangerous because its a multi factor issue ... Because of thermal dynamics you cant say ok ... its safe no matter what ... but you would have to have a large amount of energy .. Its just with light ( btw same type of electromagnetic radiation ... no joke radio waves and light are basically the same thing just on a different place in the spectrum )  Anyway... Frequency + power are the importen part here ... the lower the frequency the less energy your body absorbs and the more energy just passes trough you ... That means you feel less energy from 2 watt of radio energy then from 2 watts of Solar energy ( sunshine ) because the body absorbs that energy allot more easy ... BTW mobiles have a really weak sender so no you cant feel it ;) .. So they claimed that mobiles where as dangerous as Xrays .. and as deadly .. something that is a right out lie. And they banned me for that .. With reference links ... and this explanation here i just have given you can see its impossible to do that well in 100 characters message and they lied about there rules in the comment field .... <br><br>What i cant understand .. why lie ? why this aggressive ? Its the best reputable news source we have here and they lied ... and 99% of people are not going to fact check them. Also yes i read 2 research papers they linked that was like 100 pages each ... so it did take some time .. but who is gonna do that ? you cant even trust the comment field because factual critic might be censored out.<br><br>While i love your video here i think its pointless because sure you might now have learned to find the fact about some memes ... but that does not mean you can find actual facts especially if trustworthy news site cant be even trusted", "comment_date": "2019-03-18T10:01:06Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Mohd Ali", "comment_text": "Hehe I&#39;m so guilty of &quot;lateral reading&quot;.

Here in the Netherlands, we have the NOS for example. Its the news brought to us by the gouverments money. A few years ago, a plane with a lot of Dutch citicens was shot down above Ukraine. As far as I know, to this date it isn&#39;t 100% proven that the russians did it, but just minutes after the tragidy, the NOS blamed Russia. But now comes the interesting part. At one time, Putin was in the UK (if I remember correctly) so afcorse, Putin was asked to comment about the tragidy. At the Dutch NOS, we got to see a cut version in wich we see the question being asked by a English reporter and Putin walking away.

Humans are also biased, so they look for information that reaffirms them. <br>The problem is the wealthy.<br>The solution is to get money out of politics. From there, you need to DRASTICALLY improve the education system and make all universities free.

There is no downside to publishing BS and there ought to be.  We need internet content providers to make some changes, where the channels have along with those &quot;like&quot; or thumbs up buttons,  additional buttons on the article that allows the reader to click &quot;This is fake news&quot;, or &quot;This is a misleading article&quot;, or &quot;The author of the article is bogus&quot; and after enough clicks that account is automatically blocked and all articles removed.  To prevent bot&#39;s or fake accounts or radical followers from abusing that feature, each account clicking one of those buttons can only do so once a day, and every IP address has to be unique.  Furthermore, any account used to disparage legitimate posts could themselves be blocked and removed, so people just being vindictive, or running herds of bots, risk having their account blocked, or their bot&#39;s accounts blocked and/or deleted.

But I also understand the other side of that, that humans can&#39;t keep up indefinitely and every job that can be done (even if badly right now) by an algorithm eventually will need to be. Making the algorithms unexploitable (or at leas very nearly so) is going to be crucial to that future.<br><br><br>With the verification of what we see online, we also do need to remember where we are and what we&#39;re doing. If I retweet Velociraptor Earth (parody of Flat Earth that asserts the planet is shaped like a velociraptor), obviously what I&#39;m retweeting isn&#39;t real, but it&#39;s also not meant to be. My followers either know that, or they&#39;re a stranger who followed me and it&#39;s their own fault if they&#39;re that stupid. You, however, can&#39;t afford to retweet a parody without calling it out as a parody because you have mostly followers you don&#39;t know and have a responsibility towards even the ones who can&#39;t discern what many of us see as &quot;obvious jokes&quot; from reality.<br><br><br>For the average person, the larger issue is passing false information to friends who carry on the chain or get upset or hurt by it. A recent example has been certain non-political insults hurled at politicians. Calling them various mental disorders in a hateful tone doesn&#39;t hurt the politician because no one changes their vote because some armchair psychologist blathered on the internet, but helps stigmatize people with actual mental disorders, associating them with the negative personality traits of politicians we dislike even though those traits have nothing to do with the mental disorder. Unlike the fighter pilots, we aren&#39;t in a hurry. Nobody&#39;s gunning for us, we&#39;re not on the clock for a media company. We can stop and consider the ramifications of our retweets, including whether it&#39;s real or not and whether it&#39;s good or not. The latter is what takes over when it&#39;s not about fact, such as when people are retweeting a comedian tweeting a joke mocking someone we feel threatened by...and ignoring that the &quot;joke&quot; happens to be a derogatory slur against a minority. Things are only going to get better if we stop trying to be heard and start listening slowly and carefully before contributing.", "comment_date": "2019-03-18T00:27:49Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Jammin428", "comment_text": "@Timcast is a great honest journalist on media culture.", "comment_date": "2019-03-18T00:26:34Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Ben Peterson", "comment_text": "The following request is probably best for after your algorithmic manipulation series is out, but I would be very interested in you sharing your thoughts about these things on a podcast.

There are many generations that have asked the same question Pilate asked of Jesus - &quot;What is truth?&quot; It&#39;s amazing to see that while it is more difficult for a modern day human to discern truth because of the sheer vastness of falsehood presented, the solution to these problems has been available for much longer.<br><br>Jesus Christ plainly declared that He is <b>the</b> truth (John 14:6). He told us that when the Comforter (the Holy Ghost, the Spirit of Truth) came He would guide us into all truth (John 16:7, 13). This Spirit of Truth can live inside of those who believe in Jesus Christ, but the world cannot receive it (John <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUiYglgGbos&amp;t=14m17s\">14:17</a>).<br><br>It is this Spirit of Truth, this Holy Ghost, this Jesus Christ inside you that will be the only absolute source of Truth. In the best of our logical attempts to discern truth, our feeble minds are led astray by the most cunning deceptions. As you mentioned here, there are points where (since there was <b>some</b> clear truth), you would conclude that the entire message was truth. This was the tactic the devil used from the beginning, and still is his tactic today. Consider even that the devil used scripture (which IS true) to tempt Jesus to do something that was NOT according to the truth (Matthew 4:6-7).<br><br>The part I mentioned about the Spirit of Truth living inside is very important, because you can actually know for certainty what is true and false. The Spirit of Truth (Jesus, who <b>is</b> truth) will &quot;testify&quot; or &quot;witness&quot; whether the thing you see or hear is of the truth. His Spirit inside you will either agree or disagree with the spirit of the thing you hear, and prevent you from being deceived. You only need listen to that still, small voice. I do believe that you have heard that voice yourself from time to time. I just encourage you to listen carefully.<br><br>The Bible does warn us that we aren&#39;t to believe everything without fact-checking, but the method the Bible implores us to use is not the natural means.<br>Beloved, believe not every spirit, but try the spirits whether they are of God: because many false prophets are gone out into the world. 1 John 4:1<br><br>In essence, the simplest way to know truth is to ask the One who IS the truth. It&#39;s like looking at the source code. The point Katie made right off the bat is actually a similar method to what God expects us to do -- check where the information came from (except from a spiritual, not carnal standpoint). The difference in doing your own research and asking God is like the difference between trying to prepare puffer fish yourself at home, or trusting an expert chef of 20 years experience with the dish. With one, you can unintentionally poison yourself, where with the other, the guesswork is removed and you just get the delicious rewards.<br><br>Don&#39;t get me wrong. I&#39;m not disagreeing with the information you presented here. This video will help someone to get a little closer to discerning truth from lies, and I commend you for helping in any way you can. The very fact that you have talked about the subject will encourage many to be more vigilant when they share information online.<br><br>As humans, we all need some help beyond our capacity to know certain things. This is why we learn from those who specialize in certain fields, and trust experts who know vastly more than we do in specific areas. I am grateful that we have a heavenly Father who knows literally everything and anything that can be known, and He is willing to tell us things we don&#39;t know (Jeremiah 33:3). All He wants us to do is ask in faith.<br><br>And ye shall know the truth, and the truth shall make you free.

You have media outlets with various interests. They will all tell you they&#39;re not lying to you. After all, who would openly say they&#39;re lying? But you know they&#39;re at the very least bending facts to push a narrative. So you decide to rely on some third party that will do the work for you, and they prove trustworthy. Until they&#39;re not. Until they either start buying into the narrative, they&#39;re bought by the narrative, or are bullied into the narrative. What do you do then, if you can even tell you&#39;re suddenly being misled?<br>Nah. Eff that noise. What you need to do is go to the source. When the media tells you this person says this or that, go see the video of that person actually saying it. When the media tells you white nationalist kids are shouting down a native American, go see the video. When the media tells you some individual is calling for the death of certain minorities and is sowing hatred, go see what he says. What you&#39;ll find is that the person said something completely different. Or that those kids were more akin to victims than aggressors. Or that the individual in question is the most lied about person on the face of the planet.<br>Do not trust someone else to draw conclusions for you. See with your own eyes, hear with your own ears, discuss your conclusions with your own mouth. Tell others what you see, understand what they&#39;re seeing. Have a conversation, have a debate. We&#39;re all biased in one way or another, and the only way we can discover that bias is by getting in touch with the people we disagree with, and understanding where the disagreement comes from. This is why the media is pushing so much of this progressive left rhetoric. Because at the root of that rhetoric lies censorship of competing ideas. The people they promote are very ideologically possesed and they are not interested in discussion, so they cannot identify their bias and can thus be easily manipulated. The people they disparage are being censored, kicked off media platforms like Twitter, Facebook, YouTube, and are thus unable to make their voice heard and are unable to defend themselves. Thus the media sows continuous disagreement, continuous conflict. And conflict is what the media feeds on. Don&#39;t play their game. Keep discourse alive.

Liberal government and police chief of Toronto were pushing for stricter gun laws and regulations on licensed owners. They cited that over 50% of guns used in crimes are domestically sourced. Later reports found that these claims were 100% fabricated. Some of the outlets that republished the initial reports made redactions, but nobody cares about that. Especially considering the environment about anti-gun sentiments.  This kind of thing is what Harry G. Frankfurt wrote about on his publication &quot;On Bullshit&quot;. Whether you are for or against guns, any reasonable person can agree that misrepresenting the truth has no place in public discussions. On this topic, they brought up an emotional subject that everybody can get behind: ending gun violence. But then they mislead the people by misrepresenting the truth and used legal gun owners as a scapegoat even though statistically they&#39;re the least likely to commit violent crimes, especially since there&#39;s daily background checks for gun owners here in Canada.<br><br>Likewise, there&#39;s a lot of issues of a lack of transparency with the current government here in Canada. A lot of people were dissatisfied with the conservative Harper government, but this Trudeau government has had its share of issues. He&#39;s blatantly lied about spending, and when asked to answer for his questions he goes on a rant about how he&#39;s doing it for the people and he&#39;s done more to help anybody else has. Now there&#39;s issues of corruption claims, and interference with court cases. He&#39;s like a Liberal version of Trump.

With more than 7 billion human beings on Earth we must be having an effect.  But climate science is incredibly complicated and I think many advocates of reducing greenhouse gas emissions are understandably reluctant to admit how much we don&#39;t know.  I say understandably because I think many people believe that in order to convince people to make changes they need to convince people the danger from climate change is imminent, severe, and certain.  Therefore, if someone questions the data in a climate change report the typical response I see is the claim that &quot;the science is settled&quot; and that the person raising the question is a &quot;climate change denier.&quot;  What I remember learning in school is that science is never settled in that any theory must be considered open to revision if new evidence is revealed.  If questions are raised about data those questions should be answered on the merits not dismissed as though blasphemous.<br><br><br>As I said I believe anthropomorphic climate change is real.  What I don&#39;t believe is that climate scientist know with as much certainty as is claimed (by some) that by reducing emissions by X amount we will reduce global temperature increases by Y degrees.  I think that the economic cost of some regulations to reduce emissions are more certain than the potential benefit of those regulations.  What I worry about is that we may pass certain regulations that may make us feel better because &quot;we are doing something about the problem&quot; without any actual significant improvement.  I don&#39;t know that they won&#39;t either.

The news was more fact-based. &quot;Today the city council passed a local budget with an increase to x dollars. This is an increase of 3% from last year. The vote was 5 to 4.&quot; today the same event would easily be covered as &quot;Today mayor rampage has activists worried about spending too much money.&quot; In the past, there was much less emotion. To be truly savy, you (Not somebody else) must go to &quot;source documents&quot;. Find sources that are illegal for falsehoods, for example, published government agendas/records, court documents, that little white paper that nobody reads with your medication, CEO quarterly stockholder meetings. <br>A different example. Anything news or politics that makes you &quot;feel&quot; is a garbage news article. Anything with anon sources is garbage. Instead of reading an &quot;Outrage&quot; account of what happened at a local city council meeting. Take a minute and look up the agenda item from the council meeting web page. Then read the actual report attached to the item. Or if you have an issue with a State or Federal piece of legislation, read the bill. You will be surprised to learn what is actually in it. After doing this for a while you will learn that many times the title of the bill is actually the opposite of what it does and that most reporters are just repeating the lie from each other. Just having sources is not enough, just working for a large media company is not enough. You must look at the source and make your mind up for yourself and not continue to let someone else continue to do it for you.  <br>This is true from both sides.

The main concern when consuming news should not be quite so focused on the neutrality of that news source so much as their dedication to reporting on topics accurately. Blanket forced neutrality on all subjects is often seen as a proxy for the quality of a news organization whether or not the topic has two equal sides arguing, more than two sides of different levels of validness and evidence arguing (e.g. Economic theories) or topics where there is basically a correct evidenced based side and no other equal argument (e.g. LGBTQ people deserve human rights, people of all ethnic backgrounds are equally human, climate change is caused by humans and needs to be addressed, Vaccines don&#39;t cause autism, etc); this leads to too many new organizations using forced neutrality on all subjects as a way to retain their authority in the eyes of a public that has come to a point that they largely refuse to believe that many subjects have asymmetric sides, that believe that the middle ground in all arguments is in the center of two extremes. The reality is that a lot of topics are more like a sledgehammer than a see-saw; sure, they have a balance point that isn&#39;t at the very end of either side, but the balance point is clearly much closer to one end than the other. As soon as a new organization present it that way, in the actually accurate, reality and evidenced-based way the topic should be reported...they are labeled as &#39;biased&#39; and &#39;partisan&#39; because we&#39;ve gotten to a point in our news where most people don&#39;t really let themselves be informed by good, accurate news reporting...they just use it to confirm their own beliefs in &#39;both-sides-ism&#39; and anything that asserts that any topic has unequal sides is tossed out as having an agenda rather than perhaps themselves having an agenda to maintain their own worldview.", "comment_date": "2019-03-17T18:40:02Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Iron Maiden", "comment_text": "You can apply those same three question steps to ask if Religion is worth re-tweeting about.", "comment_date": "2019-03-17T18:39:37Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "N3rs", "comment_text": "Who will watch the watcher?

Not anymore but I would pull on people&#39;s heart strings with lies. I would often get 6 million views on more than 25 to 30 posts over the years on my personal FB account. I never monetized it so it was easy to just stop doing it after I cared more about truth over time. It was soooo easy to post something and it&#39;s addicting to watch the likes roll in. Wake up tomorrow and post has over several million views or likes. Etc. I figured out that it seemed MORE people will simply share versus research it. Often those who did research and would call it out in the comments, I would delete their comment as to keep people in the dark. It was so easy. I can literally repeat this right now today and almost guarantee within a week have over 5 mill views. However, today, as I&#39;ve been trying to create a LEGIT buisness, I&#39;ve been utilizing these tactics for everyone&#39;s benefit instead of using it against them. One thing I&#39;m big on now is citing sources. Crediting the original information to its creator. ie: a missing child and police want help finding her, cite the news station. Fox, Abc etc) people felt OBLIGATED to share a post about a missing child. So it helped me do what I was passionate about without lying. Just find news that matters. Find news that people want to know. You don&#39;t HAVE to make stuff up to get views. And because of people like Destin and this lady, more and more people are learning to research so it&#39;s in your best interest to not lie.

The problem lies in journalistic ethics going downhill with the race to be the first to report on something.<br>It was unavoidable, as our communication got faster and our brains craved that dopamine rush of instant gratification and confirmation bias. Yet nobody saw it coming.<br>But there&#39;s a lot you can learn by simply sitting and observing. So I came up with a few rules to determine what&#39;s believable and what&#39;s not.<br><br>1: Nobody&#39;s unbiased. NOBODY:<br>There&#39;s a huge demand for truly unbiased information and some people surf that wave while they can. But eventually, the mask always falls. So the trick is to keep track of who has whose bias. They think you forget. Don&#39;t.<br>I would much rather listen to somebody who clearly states his bias than somebody who pretends to be unbiased. Chances are, in today&#39;s climate, that the biased person is clearly aware that&#39;s just his opinion while the &quot;unbiased&quot; is pushing a narrative.<br><br>2: Wait 48-72 hours until all details come out:<br>This is the OODA loop Destin described, so i won&#39;t expand much further except from the fact that you can learn a lot by &quot;sitting and observing&quot; in those first 48 hours. You can quickly pick up who&#39;s pushing a narrative by how fast they jump the gun. Those are the media you SHOULD NOT thrust, at least as an unbiased source.<br><br>3: Buzzfeed is cancer:<br>By that, I don&#39;t mean it&#39;s full of far left activists pretending to be journalists. I mean that the Buzzfeed business model is the epitome of this problem. You see, Buzzfeed pays writers by article rather by a fixed wage or by how much traffic to the site it generates. It&#39;s entry level &quot;journalism&quot; for overgrown children fresh off college trying to make ends meet rather than building a name for themselves. That&#39;s why they don&#39;t even bother putting a picture of themselves besides their name on the top of the article. Buzzfeed business model encourages trash articles to generate clickbait and hateclick traffic, and that&#39;s all you&#39;re going to get with sites with the business as theirs. They started this clickbaiting culture, thus the dabacle of integral journalism.<br><br>4: NOBODY. IS. UNBIASED:<br>I can&#39;t stress this enough. Not even Mediawise. It&#39;s a &quot;who watches the Watchmen?&quot; question. Today, everyone&#39;s got a social media profile. So make use of that name besides the article you just read and do the 2+2. Some even have a direct link to their social media profile(s). You can marry this to Rule #2 and #5 to great effect.<br><br>5: Twitter is cancer:<br>You have everything that&#39;s wrong with journalism crammed into a more vapid, 288 character limit platform. Twitter is basically Buzzfeed\u00b3.<br><br>6: Nobody cares what you think:<br>This is exactly why you should think before you share something. I&#39;ve always lived my life through Plato&#39;s guideline &quot;the wise man has something to say. The fool needs to say something&quot;. So instead of caving in to the dopamine rush of the likes you&#39;re going to receive, think you&#39;re just promoting something for free. Personally, I don&#39;t replicate any news or opinion articles unless it&#39;s a reflection I find particularly interesting from one of my friends or from myself. My social media profile has very little content and what little I post is just either something I find funny, a nice picture (that may or may not include photos of my cats) obscure music I stumbled upon and the rare political takes are when there&#39;s something so blatantly wrong in the collective&#39;s mindset that I can&#39;t help but make fun of them.<br><br>In the end, I must repeat.<br>&quot;The wise man has something to say.

Tim Pool waited, and looked before posting and he had the actual information. SO many of the hysterical media instantly went with their built in narrative that the racist white MAGA kids blocked, surrounded, and taunted the poor native american Vietnam veteran who was just innocently marching and banging his drum chanting peace and harmony. <br><br>This narrative persists today on many of the hysterical media sites, their twitter account time lines and Hollywood elites twitter time lines. It&#39;s the reason their getting the begeasus sued out of them. (and rightfully so) <br><br>Tim Pool said &quot;at first i saw it and said &quot;so what, it&#39;s a guy walking up to some kids banging a drum. big deal&quot;, then the internet exploded over an image of a white kid smugly smiling at this poor native american&quot;. He did some actual, you know, journalism, the stuff CNN and the rest of the hysterical media could have done if they&#39;d spent say, 10 minutes searching, and found evidence to refute the narrative they so desperately wanted to push. <br><br>Turns out, the truth was not somewhere in the middle, it was way off to the fringes. The far leftist socialist native american former military refrigerator repairman who went AWOL several times during his stateside tour, decided to walk up to the white kids being called incest babies by the Black Hebrew Israelite, among other awful things (these are adults taunting and tormenting a bunch of high school kids, and the drumming douche nugget decided he had to defend the racist Black Hebrew Israelites from the white kids minding their own business). <br><br>So he walked up to them, and stood directly in the face of one kid, who didn&#39;t back away, and banged his drum chanting loudly for an uncomfortable amount of time directly in this kids face. Then when he was done, he stood off to the side to see if he was noticed, for a few minutes, and walked away. <br>He was then interviewed not once but several times where he blatantly and obviously lied over and over. claiming he was minding his own business walking down the mall and was blocked and surround by these racist white kids with maga hats chanting build the wall who trapped him and prevented him from moving and made him fear for his life. <br><br>He even managed a tear in one interview while retelling his made up fantasy world garbage. The leftist media (but i repeat myself) ate it up and pushed their narrative far and wide with ZERO time checking anything. It fit their narrative, it had all the pieces of the perfect story...anti trump (maga hats) white kids (anti male, anti white) native american (identity politics). They thought they hit the jackpot. It was all garbage, and now they&#39;re getting rightfully sued for a gagillion dollars for intentionally, with forethought and malice, trying to (and partially succeeding) to destroy the lives of these kids and specifically that one kid who just stood still while this douche knuckle banged a drum in his face. <br><br>Unlike most leftists who squeal about how awful it is that they&#39;re getting made up invented death threats, this kid got a LOT of credible ones, directly calling for his and his family&#39;s death (the left are so tolerant), doxing them and i believe may have had some actual attempts at attacking him.

First off, being skeptical of only names you don&#39;t recognize just further entrenches you in your echo chamber. The lady you&#39;re working with there has a positive reaction when she sees the subject matter was written about by outlets like The Washington Post, despite the fact that they have been caught multiple times posting information without verifying it and putting their desire to push an ideology above their desire to share the truth (most recent example I can think of would be their Covington coverage). Furthermore, as Peter Boghossian and James Lindsay demonstrated last year, you can&#39;t even trust peer-reviewed &quot;studies&quot;, because they are easy to fake, and ideologues within the education system are eager to corroborate anything that aligns with their biases. Their bogus study that got published about dog-humping in parks being a sign of rape culture could easily have been shared by The Huffington Post or other names that this lady would recognize. So, according to her standards, she would have recognized the name of The Huffington Post, and she would have gotten a link to a &quot;study&quot; that corroborates the information. So according to her steps in this video, it would have been fine to share that as truth, even though the authors have later revealed that it was 100% nonsense. <br>My final reservation about all of this is that we have already seen companies that set themselves up as the people that could find the truth amidst the misinformation (Snopes, Politifact, etc.), and every time, they wind up being just as biased and untrustworthy as the news outlets they are critiquing.

If you&#39;re a conservative, news sources progressives like to read (not getting into a debate whether that makes them biased) like the Washington Post (said to be reputable in your video) are irreparably skewed. I think a dimmer view of the problem is more appropriate. People do follow the cycle you suggested, but they define &quot;reputable sources&quot; and &quot;good evidence&quot; differently (just read the comment section of this video). An even darker view is that this video may itself worsen the problem by encouraging people to cling more closely to their &quot;reputable&quot; news source in the verify step. I think this video should have given a lot of time to explaining what a &quot;reputable&quot; source is, but I understand your constraints as a non-partisan channel; it&#39;s hard to thread the needle.

This might seem obvious but because of this, the number of specialized is high enough that bad actors in every industry start popping up and reduce the public trust in that field so our problem starts when the people consuming news aren&#39;t knowledgeable enough to discern what is real or not even with the internet at their fingertips, and with the availability of news dissemination and the fact that anyone can doctor an image for example, the people creating fake news cant even be called out anymore for their misdeeds. Twitter is a good example for this because people follow actors or musicians they like for example and these people aren&#39;t required to keep their posts, likes and retweets limited to their work so they end up sharing stuff out of their fields of knowledge and if something they share is fake they are on one hand not responsible for the fakes someone else created and on another hand not called out as miss-informers because the information they disseminated isn&#39;t in their field of work so it doesn&#39;t affect their career in the first place (if not related to racism, religion, other social justice, etc.). <br>Very popular specialists shearing opinions outside their specialty is what&#39;s fostering this issue and there isn&#39;t much anyone can do about it for now, until the next generation grows up or until something really bad happens because of this, nothing will change in the grand scheme of things regarding news and the very true fact that it sucks XD.", "comment_date": "2019-03-17T16:41:33Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Yimo Awanardo", "comment_text": "Coffeebreak&#39;s theme all over the internet now lol", "comment_date": "2019-03-17T16:41:33Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Ryan Dono", "comment_text": "&quot;Partnered by Google&quot; already a bias for the left wing right there", "comment_date": "2019-03-17T16:41:23Z", "likes_count": 11}, {"comment_by": "Sebastian Lee", "comment_text": "You should talk to Tim Pool about Journalism.", "comment_date": "2019-03-17T16:41:19Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "A-Aron Fpv", "comment_text": "This video is shareable!", "comment_date": "2019-03-17T16:41:03Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "GooGhoul (plx bite)", "comment_text": "You only need to ask one question: Is it boring? <br>The truth is boring, it doesn&#39;t make for non-boring headlines or blurbs.

That&#39;s my take on it, anyway. Fact checking takes too much effort. The lie-spreader can always say &quot;sorry&quot; and delete it if they&#39;re called out. If not, meh.
