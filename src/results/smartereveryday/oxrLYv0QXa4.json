I don&#39;t know anything about this offhand, but I just got thinking about how dragonflies have four wings, and I started to wonder what the extent of their agility would actually be.  Since they can control all four wings independently\u2014both respecting motion in one direction (flapping up and down), as well as angle in the opposite direction (rotation forwards/backwards)\u2014wouldn&#39;t it be possible for them to use two wings to rotate upon one axis, while using the other two wings to simultaneously rotate upon a second axis; in so doing, changing their orientation with respect to the third axis, upon which they&#39;re NOT rotating?<br><br>In other words, I&#39;m assuming that it would at least be possible in theory, if not actually possible, for a dragonfly to make a full 360 degree rotation either forwards or backwards (front flip/backflip), while also making a full 360 degree rotation either clockwise or counterclockwise (roll over in either direction), and in so doing, face 180 degrees opposite their original direction\u2014by default, and literally without ever actually turning around.<br><br>Am I right?", "comment_date": "2022-03-08T01:45:56Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Neil Yakuza", "comment_text": "That was amazing!

Current aircrafts and remote air vehicles are too large to operate in some special civil applications, such as search and rescue operations inside buildings, but a micro air vehicle (MAV), with a size smaller than 150\u2009mm and a weight less than 50 g, can be used.Inspired by the motion of tiny flying insects, flapping has been implemented as the primary mechanism of force generation in almost all developed MAVs to satisfy the above  mentioned requirements. During the take-off procedure, great updraft force is generated so that the insect can overcome gravity and quickly leave the ground. Flapping with leg jump. Pond studied the take-off of a species of locust, Schistocerca gregaria, and found that the locusts first jump into the air before flapping their wings. Greater updraft forces observed to overcome gravity and thus float and even fly. If we could think other means to continuously greatest updraft by electromagnetic forces processes to overcome gravity for heavier duty made vehicle to float vertically and finally, the take-off process is over, and the heavy duty vehicle starts to fly forward by advance AI novel micro robotics lightweight chips. Among the many insects with outstanding flying abilities, dragonflies possess unique flight characteristics and strong maneuvering abilities which we need to go for further research focus on the wings unique patterns.", "comment_date": "2020-11-11T09:05:48Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Mary Lagua", "comment_text": "Kids bring joy.", "comment_date": "2020-10-12T12:07:07Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "E\u011eLEN,OYNA,\u00d6\u011eREN", "comment_text": "L\u00fctfen alt yaz\u0131 dillerine t\u00fcrk\u00e7e de eklermisi please", "comment_date": "2020-10-03T00:08:27Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "downhilltwofour00", "comment_text": "Wow!
