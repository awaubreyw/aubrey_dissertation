I&#39;d personally like to keep the neighbors happy if possible.<br>Hunting: Ever fire a rifle in the silence of the forest? That&#39;s VERY bad for your hearing. I don&#39;t want hunters losing their hearing, over something as stupid as the current process for legally getting suppressors.<br>Home defense: Like hunters, a lot of people who are prepared for a possible home invasion, choose not to wear hearing protection. Wouldn&#39;t want some dastardly assailant to sneak up on you right? And there aren&#39;t a lot of things louder than shooting a long gun in the house.<br>Learning tool: New shooters can be intimidated by a gun. They&#39;ll flinch and miss because they&#39;re anticipating the noise and recoil. Suppressors (along with their obvious effect) help lower recoil to an extent.

The loud crack of the bullet breaking the sound barrier isn&#39;t technically hearing safe. (can cause hearing damage) Suppressors have wide usage. No, it&#39;s not like the movies being nearly silent taking everyone out with nobody hearing. They are used for things like hunting, defense, and some stealth. Take, for example, if god forbid, you need to use a firearm to protect yourself or family while inside your home (someone breaks in) having a suppressor on your firearm is a good thing.

I can&#39;t think of any other forces acting on the suppressor cover that would have caused such a forward motion, so my best guess is that the pressure differential &quot;sucked&quot; the cover off.

The features at the front of the suppressor is actually a quenching section, which cools the gasses by forcing the hot gasses to transfer its heat to the metal.  When the hot gas cools the volume in turn decreases, which reduces the sound signature.  As the suppressor gets hotter, this effect reduces a little, but it&#39;s the first time I&#39;ve seen actual quenching used in a suppressor.  This is why the old suppressors with steel wool in them worked so well; there was massive surface area to transfer the heat to, but the wool didn&#39;t last very long because it rusted from the heat and moisture, not to mention heated up quickly, reducing its ability to absorb more heat.", "comment_date": "2017-09-25T13:58:32Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Nick Venture", "comment_text": "My life if now complete", "comment_date": "2017-09-25T13:55:59Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Dimes On His Eyes", "comment_text": "Getting smrtr with guns. &#39;murica!", "comment_date": "2017-09-25T13:55:24Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "b0xMachine", "comment_text": "smarter every 2nd month", "comment_date": "2017-09-25T13:53:56Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Duane Young", "comment_text": "PHYSICS, b-words!", "comment_date": "2017-09-25T13:43:14Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Paul Tani", "comment_text": "You earned it buddy I wish I could subscribe more then one time lol", "comment_date": "2017-09-25T13:43:12Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Rishi", "comment_text": "Does the high speed camera not capture sound?", "comment_date": "2017-09-25T13:37:37Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Josh Campbell", "comment_text": "Science is SOOO awesome!!!", "comment_date": "2017-09-25T13:35:56Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "SANTAtheGREY", "comment_text": "Great video!
