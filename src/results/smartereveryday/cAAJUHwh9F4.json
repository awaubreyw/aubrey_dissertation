It&#39;s difficult to believe that the corner blower (non)rollers can maintain a pillow of air even with a mile of film being under tension, which... I assume the tension is all produced on the pull end? Since the film doesn&#39;t touch anything along the way (meaning you can&#39;t push the film along between start/finish?). So, even though it&#39;s likely a lot less force required to pull that film than if it were touching rollers since there&#39;s no rolling resistance (like pushing a mag-lev train ... which, then has me wonder whether a person can push a mag-lev train...) it&#39;s still gotta be a not insignificant amount of force to pull the mile of film. AND THEN - how to they start/stop the process? Cuz all the lights were on while you were filming, and they were touching (what I assume was) un-coated support - is there a sacrificial two miles of support (one on the leading end, one of the trailing end) used to maintain tension on the system and drag the coated film through the entire process w/ the lights off? Or do they just keep using the same two miles, splicing it on/off with each batch? How many times did they have to iterate this design before construction? And how did they iterate back in the 90&#39;s w/o computer simulation to visualize design issues in the original design?", "comment_date": "2022-09-01T13:20:49Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "btpuppy2", "comment_text": "Where is part 3 of the Kodak tour?", "comment_date": "2022-09-01T09:22:51Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Thomas MacGruber", "comment_text": "I wish this video was longer then 10 minute.....whaaaa that was an hour?!", "comment_date": "2022-09-01T08:53:24Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Tony Zoccolillo", "comment_text": "Where&#39;s part 3?", "comment_date": "2022-09-01T00:41:21Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Greg", "comment_text": "Destin, when the camera changes from your handheld to the other one (<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cAAJUHwh9F4&amp;t=45m42s\">45:42</a>, for instance), it&#39;s like we go from a YouTube video to a proper film.

You can&#39;t guide tensioned film without at least contact at the ends where it&#39;s guided? Right? Or does it ride on the backing of it at the ends where it gets turned via rollers and the longs stretches it floats like you referenced with the air hockey table.

Who would thought  laminar flow was the key to film manufacturing. I would think it would be too erratic or chaotic to control  12 + layers  using that process.

Where they actually come together at the 90\u00b0 angle.Where the step of the titanium slats meet? I would think that would have to be rounded at the very least. Plus the polished ports you showed. It seems that it would have a turbulent if not negative pressure in those corners.? Maybe even cause a fissure effect? Does the laminar flow that encapsulates the layers help with that.? I must say..that machine probably took forever to get all of it tuned to actually produce a product that works.. just wondering cause this stuff is interesting to know.

Keep in mind in those pre-digital days, Kodak had probably a hundred different emulsions and most were available in many different sizes. What you saw here was the coating of color NEGATIVE film. A completely different division manufactured photographic paper-- beginning with the paper base itself. In 1978, Kodak have THREE huge paper mills at Kodak Park just to keep up with the demand.

In my career, I worked in both Kodak and Fujifilm laboratories and never knew how film was manufactured. Your videos demonstrated how invested Kodak was in this industry. The R&amp;D is incredible! <br><br>Jeff is an awesomely educated guy! As I watched him try to dumb down the technical terms I thought to myself that it was still flying over my head. He really knows his stuff and apparently very important to Kodak. As I watched him describe the processes, I was getting concerned for him. He seemed to be short of breath at times and I was afraid that he was about to collapse. I hope that he is aware of his health condition. Kodak can\u2019t afford to lose such a key person.<br><br>I look forward to PART 3!", "comment_date": "2022-07-21T23:08:30Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "brink668", "comment_text": "Mind Blown\u2026.

I also coordinated an effort to buy that film, and package it into 3 100 foot rolls and 18 36 exposure cassettes. All of that had to be done in the dark.
