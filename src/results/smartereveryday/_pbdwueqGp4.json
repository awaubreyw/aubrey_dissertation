Being a former Coast Guard pilot I have thousands of hours of helo experience. ALL helos can pivot around any point in space. It just takes the pilot to make the appropriate control movements. It is called &quot;low work&quot;. When I was teaching new pilots &quot;turns on a spot&quot; I would do a pivot around them so they could get a better sight picture but I could do a turn around the tail, the rotor shaft, myself, or any other point inside or outside the aircraft. With the more experienced pilots, we often had competitions. Being a left-hander it took me longer to learn until I was taken under the wing of another left-hander with many more hours. We made up all kinds of exercises to practice. Aircraft are made for right-handers. As mentioned on a regular helo you have the rotor system and a tail rotor so the tail rotor provides the turning force. On a CH-47 the rudder pedals are intermixed with the cyclic controls to change the angle of attack of the two rotor systems to provide a twisting moment. Again it is the skill of the pilot that makes the CH-47 pivot around any point in space though there are some standard maneuvers that the CH-47 pilots are trained to do, due to the size of the aircraft. Figure maneuvering something 100 feet long, actually, 98, which is the rotor paths tip to tip. Most houses are only 30 to 40 feet long. The transmissions of both rotors turn at the exact same RPM. The rotors can&#39;t hit each other even though they overlap each other. Now there is a vertical hinge on each blade that does allow a certain amount of lead and lag but this is restricted to prevent interference. This allows for weight and airflow imbalances. The horizontal hinge allows the blades to move up and down and the blades are only held in position by centrifugal force. The rotor plane cones when power (angle of attack) is applied. When the rotors get below a certain rpm the droop stops flip in to prevent the rotors from dropping and hitting the aircraft or ground. The tilt in the forward rotor allows the aircraft to fly more level in forward flight, therefore, being more aerodynamic plus the rotors being on two different levels minimizes the interference from the tail rotor blades going through the airflow of the forward rotors. Now with retreating blade stall on the CH-47, yes you can push it but you will lose lift and also cause flutter. CH-47 rotor blades are not solid and are actually bonded (glued) together. If you get too much flutter, they will crack and break. In the operational flight manual for the CH-47 (available online), there are airspeed limitations mainly due to density altitude, gross weight, and rotor blade compression but also the configuration of the aircraft. All helos have them. Now pusher prop aircraft usually have stub wings to take some of the lift requirement off of the rotor system so the blades don&#39;t stall as their angle of attack is less. A greater angle of attack is what causes the retreating blade to stall. I hope this helps.", "comment_date": "2022-08-03T01:14:01Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "CFITOMAHAWK", "comment_text": "First practical rotorcraft.

On the retreating blade, the blade flaps down, increasing the angle of attack which helps balance the two sides out. This is what only works up to a certain point. It is NOT a self correcting problem. The helicopter will pitch up and roll left, potentially crashing the aircraft. The stall region around the rotor hub builds and moves left. It starts on the inside because the inside of the blade is moving slower than the tip. As airspeed increases, the stall region gets bigger.

Also, the blades are NOT FIXED to the chopper, they are free to move vertically and horizontally to a limited degree:<br>PHASE LAG<br>The advancing blade will encounter its highest rotational speed 90\u00b0 prior to a position over the nose of the aircraft, but does not experience the highest degree of flapping at this point (figure 3-19). In fact, this maximum flapping occurs over the nose, 90\u00b0 later, due to a principle of a dynamic system in resonance. A system in resonance receives a periodic excitation force sympathetic with the natural frequency of the system. The flapping frequency of a centrally hinged system is equal to the speed of rotation. Therefore, maximum response occurs 90\u00b0 after maximum periodic excitation. This is termed phase lag. In order for a helicopter in forward flight to roll into a left turn, maximum lift must be realized at the right &quot;wing&quot; position and minimum lift must be realized at the left &quot;wing&quot; position. Therefore, maximum AOA must occur at the 180\u00b0 position and minimum AOA must occur at the 360\u00b0 position. To obtain the appropriate response 90\u00b0 after maximum excitation, logic tells us forward cyclic is the appropriate input to initiate a left turn. No wonder helicopters are such a challenge to fly! Well, they are challenging, but not for this reason. Inputs are translated 90\u00b0 prior mechanically, thanks to some design engineers who had a little foresight. <br><br>Getting smarter every day?  ;-)", "comment_date": "2019-01-25T15:51:03Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "J p", "comment_text": "yin n  yang", "comment_date": "2019-01-23T00:29:02Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Robert Gore", "comment_text": "I believe you are mistaken about gyroscopic recession.  Gyroscopic recession is the cone described by the vertical axis of a spinning object most severely as the spin decays.

In aircraft, recession is a bad thing, and a lot of technology has gone into solving the problem.  However, gyroscopic displacement--the term you should have used--is a good thing and is what makes a gyro stable.  Displacement occurs when the force applied is realized exactly 90-degrees in the direction of the turn of the object, or, in the case of a helo, the rotor disc.  When the retreating blade loses lift, that loss (on the right side looking down) is realized at the tail thereby lifting the nose.  You described the effect but used the wrong term.  All helo control forces are applied 90-degrees from where you want the force be realized.

The swash plate decreases lift or angle of attack on the advancing blade while increasing pitch or angle-of-attack on the retreating blade... An airfoil, whether it be fixed wing or rotor wing, starts to loose lift at about 18 to 20 dregrees to relative wind, thus entering retreating blade stall...
