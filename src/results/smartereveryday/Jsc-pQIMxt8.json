The water is basic to prevent damaging and even far too much noise.<br>.<br>In summary... it would be as if the permanent magnets can be switch on and off like electro-magnets.<br>.<br>I tend to come up with a whole lot of various ideas that worked out awesomely, but... not often able to test my ideas out.", "comment_date": "2021-10-05T15:13:07Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Johan Venter", "comment_text": "Wow great thanks!<br>How about connecting the weights to a &quot;gearbox&quot; then this turn a heavy flywheel.

So, the light is being powered by the energy (momentum) that was required to hang it from that tree + its original mass, and as it radiates that energy it terminates into Light and the deletion of space (space between itself and the earth, because it is actually made of the earth, so it has inherited all of the earth&#39;s momentum). Think of gravity as a hot piece of metal slowly getting colder. There is not a unique force that takes heat away from this object, it simply radiates heat as all things radiate energy.  Well, space is just another form of energy, and &quot;gravity&quot; is how we radiate that energy.", "comment_date": "2019-09-10T18:24:31Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Khalil Das", "comment_text": "Why not have a winding mechanism (like in a clock) which powers a lite?", "comment_date": "2019-09-10T17:35:04Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "ROHIT JHA", "comment_text": "why links are not working ???<br>I know its been a while, but what happened to this gravity light project&#39;s site???", "comment_date": "2019-09-10T17:08:33Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Q T\u0113", "comment_text": "\ud83e\udd14what if you attached a <br>lighter weight on the upside?<br>Should that extend the decent <br>of the down side\ud83d\ude0f", "comment_date": "2019-09-10T16:42:25Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "No One", "comment_text": "don&#39;t let the chinese goverment see it they copy it man.", "comment_date": "2019-09-10T16:33:39Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "\u0905\u092a\u0928\u0947 \u092c\u093e\u092a \u0915\u094b \u092e\u0924 \u0938\u0940\u0916\u093e", "comment_text": "Very good...", "comment_date": "2019-09-10T16:20:33Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "gabe itch", "comment_text": "Exactly", "comment_date": "2019-09-10T16:02:52Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Vinit Bilwan", "comment_text": "Forget to dislike your script.", "comment_date": "2019-09-10T15:55:02Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Vinit Bilwan", "comment_text": "You meant to Hydropower?<br>Don&#39;t have enough time to watch full video.", "comment_date": "2019-09-10T15:53:19Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Simply Joe", "comment_text": "How about gravity phone charger? \ud83e\udd14", "comment_date": "2019-09-10T15:45:05Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Steep Skier", "comment_text": "Great idea!", "comment_date": "2019-09-10T15:44:43Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "technoway", "comment_text": "The people with candles in their huts are in danger.

At <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jsc-pQIMxt8&amp;t=3m52s\">3:52</a> Dustin says that the weight of 20kg (i hope i guess ritght) takes 20min for aprox. 2m. Using the formula &quot;P = m*g*S/t&quot; -&gt; P = 20kg*9.81m7s^2*2m/1200s=0.327W=327mW... This seams almonst nothing for the brighnes of this LED, can somebody approve or correct me?", "comment_date": "2019-09-07T20:24:20Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "eyewaves", "comment_text": "Brilliant !!!

I realized one could actually turn a rock mining operation on a mountain into a means of power generation.  Interestingly there was no explanation as to why this mountain top had been flattened off, made me wonder if someone had been powering something utilizing gravity and gears while supplying materials to build with.  A stretch but interesting to think about.  I got to thinking about the current scarcity of electrical power in South America and thought  with the Andes mountains one might be able to mine stone even in the modern day to not only create a viable material for construction but to also produce electricity in the process of dropping from a height down to a lower elevation for working and shipping.

It can be easily debunked with elementary physics.  The process, from lifting the 10 kg weight (as in the 10 kg bag of soil) through to the light shining from an efficient LED (light emitting diode) is based entirely on a well-established and proven law of physics. It is called The Law Of Conservation Of Energy. Simply put, it means that you can&#39;t get something from nothing - or - what comes out has first to be put in.<br><br>Consider a 10 kg (22 pounds) bag of soil that has to be lifted 1 meter (3 feet 3 inches).<br><br>g, or the gravity constant is 10 (N/kg)<br><br>The force due to weight of 10 kg = F = mg = 10 x 10N = 100N<br><br>Work done to lift the bag = F x d = 100N x 1 meter = 100 joules<br><br>So the light energy that can be obtained from this simple arrangement is 100 joules.<br><br>1 watt = 1 joule/ sec, so 100 joules provides 1 watt for 100 seconds, or 10 watts for 10 seconds, or 100 watts for 1 second.<br><br>Taking into account efficiency, the power potential is the maximum that can possibly be obtained from 10 kg dropped through 1 meter.<br><br>If the electricity obtained by a generator powered by the falling bag is used to power a 1 watt LED, we&#39;d have the following scenario: <br><br>A 1 watt LED would be powered for 100 seconds at maximum. That&#39;s 1 minute 40 seconds.  Electric generators, efficient as they may appear to be, rarely reach much more than 20% efficiency overall. Even if the overall efficiency was 50%, which is an unattainable efficiency, at best, a 1 watt LED would be lit for 50 seconds using a 1 meter drop and a weight of 10 kg. <br><br>A 1 watt LED provides hardly enough light to illuminate a small room sufficient for you to see the walls. I wouldn&#39;t want to try to read a book by it.  Any idea that such an arrangement would provide useful light for half an hour is far-fetched in the extreme.

Of course minus the power dissipation you have because of the friction the gears has etc.<br>But basicly, the height of the stones is just to store the potential energy you created by lifting the weight and the gravity is just used to release/use that potential energy you have created/stored. <br><br>Btw, I think it is very impressive how much light we can create by just lifting 20kg of stones to 1.5m height. Impressive how much energy our body is using/working with. <br><br>Oh.. There is a question that has come to my mind. When you have a weight of e.g 10kg, and it takes 10 minutes for it to reach the bottom... if you take now a 20kg weight, will it need 20 minutes now to reach the bottom from the same height? Because the LED is always using the same ammount of energy and because of this, it limits the speed of how fast the weight will sink.
