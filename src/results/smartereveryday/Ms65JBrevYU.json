Worms in the video were covered in secretions.  The secretions were sticky and since the worms wiggled through the fine iron particles the sticky secretions picked up the fine iron particles and it was those particles that the magnet picked up.  Since the secretions were sticky they also picked up the worms.  In the video it was shown that the more the magnetic was used to pick up a worm the harder it was to pick up the worm and that was due to the fact that some of the iron particles remained stuck to the magnet.  Wash the secretions off the worms and I bet they are no longer magnetic.  It is not what the worms were eating but where they were traveling that caused them to be picked up by the magnet.", "comment_date": "2022-01-09T17:06:35Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "JIM JACKSON", "comment_text": "Perhaps it&#39;s just too simple.

Our planet is being showered with them all of the time, but almost everything that goes through our atmosphere is burned up before it hits the surface and turned to dust. For all the iron that comes from space, that heat and the gravity of the Earth, combined, is enough to turn that iron into a sphere. And that&#39;s the fun part about finding them with a microscope.

I&#39;m not a zoologist or whatsoever - I&#39;m a sport scientist and engineer who knows nothing about animals. However, what I know is that there are such things as magnetosomes - those are small magnetic particles in some living organisms. Migration birds or fish use those magnetosomes to navigate during migration. I can imagine that some worms could be equipped with magnetosomes as well, to navigate underground/ in the dark. Maybe you can go ahead with this small piece of kick-off knowledge and do further experiments or ask a worm specialist ;-) However, I don&#39;t know how strong those magnetosomes are and how high the concentration in living organisms is, but I would say that you shouldn&#39;t attribute the magnetic effect to the soil at this point of &quot;research&quot; ;-)<br><br>Best Wishes from Germany<br><br>Dominic", "comment_date": "2021-04-16T10:58:28Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Jacky Liwag", "comment_text": "I just recently discovered that cutting cardboard by rolling it 45 degrees (idk airplane terms) it becomes really easy compared to just cutting it straight on.

The side with the oxygen tends to attract electrons more and is more negative.  This leaves the side with the two hydrogen more positive.  As a result, every water molecule in a grapes (and worms???) orients itself in a magnetic field. <br><br>If you hold the plus side of the magnet near the grape /worm, all the oxygen (negative) sides line up towards the magnet, making that side of the grape / worm more negative.

Iron from wear and tear on machinery blown out the exhaust pipe. Compasses out of microorganisms. And my favorite, micrometeoroids. Since then, somewhere on Youtube I did come across a meteor expert who was collecting them with a magnet off of rooftops and such but you need a microscope to confirm the origin IIRC--almost all of it is manmade.

Would need to cross section ferro magnetic area of the worm , embed in plastic epoxy, slice thin on a tome and then image on a Scanning Transmission Electron Microscope with a high resolution Electron Diffraction Spectrophotometer to see the iron nano particles and verify their composition. We have access to one at the local University and have techniques just developed for using a Dark Field Camera to see the nanometer level resolutions without metal stains. It makes sense that even if the nano particles were there, unless they were grouped together you would not have enough to stick to a magnet, but with some grouping of them due to differences in hydration and fluid flow in the worm you could have concentrations that would stick to a magnet.

Snails are a delicacy) To prepare worms for eating one must put them in a peat moss bed for a couple days to a week prior to harvesting for human ingestion.  As worms move through the soil (simplified explanation) by eating the soil taking in nutrients, and pooping out the waste.  Eating a worm picked out of the soil, will cause you to be eating worm + soil.  Eating a worm picked from a diet of peat moss, will give you a worm + peat moss. (probably a more favorable taste than worm in dirt.)  So worms eat soil ... soil has iron content.
