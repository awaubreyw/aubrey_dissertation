Then, i guess the camera has an error correcting software which, for some reason, smooth the error on the pixels of the same row. So this line is an artifact from the error correcting sotware of the camera.<br>If my guess is right, you should be able to reproduce this phenomenon in similar condition.

Then, take pictures of it with the same camera, same luminosity, same angular opening and maximal resolution. You&#39;ll maybe have to adapt the distance to the expected radioactivity of the source. Well, maybe the source should be the a few pixels high as well, so you won&#39;t have a lot of freedom.

The conditions (parallel light, long observation distance, small light source, only slight variations in wavelength) are just perfect for it. What I think happened is that you unintentionally created a doubleslit experiment and recorded one of it&#39;s minima. The Intensity of the double slit (for symmetrical slits) is proportional to cos^2(\u03c0\u22c5d\u22c5sin(\u03b1)/\u03bb), where d is the slit distance and \u03b1 the observation angle. With your \u03b1 being extremely small and basically constant due to the large distance to the rocket(it is definetly not =0 due to small orientation variations of the camera), the sharp tip width leads to slight variations in d, so at one height it should match the condition of d*\u03b1=\u03bb even if it&#39;s width is on the order 10^-2 m which would lead to low intensity. The real math would be more complicated due to unsymetrical, changing slit widths and those widths being dependent on the observation distance to the rocket, but the gist is the same.", "comment_date": "2020-11-13T11:52:55Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "MOMO", "comment_text": "Has this been solved now?", "comment_date": "2020-11-13T05:20:11Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Ryan Pruske", "comment_text": "hey destin, could it have been interference optically with the lens of the red light at the tip? the light would be polorized from the moon or something like that maybe.", "comment_date": "2020-11-12T18:03:59Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "DiamondDan", "comment_text": "Why does the yin and yang symbol resemble the magnetic field of a magnet \ud83e\uddf2?", "comment_date": "2020-11-12T06:46:04Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Biker Bear", "comment_text": "but we never went to the moon with a live person", "comment_date": "2020-11-11T05:33:59Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Dorothy Gray", "comment_text": "The moon was refreshing - Just wait for your browser to reload.", "comment_date": "2020-11-10T23:32:51Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Perichron John", "comment_text": "Was there a follow up video?", "comment_date": "2020-11-10T21:52:43Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Mary's Little Helpers", "comment_text": "<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9reizHjwuNY&amp;t=5m02s\">5:02</a>  Just a thought, but my best guess would be that this is an example of atmospheric refraction induced by a cold front on top of a warmer front that just happened to line up in the right spot at the top of the rocket.  If you take a closer look, you can see that the &quot;edges&quot; of the moon are slightly deformed at that line.  It&#39;s almost as if the bottom section of the moon was cut off and moved slightly higher than it should be.  If the temperature of the air under the line was slightly warmer than the temperature above the one (and not a gradient, but isolated fronts), then the change in air density would appear to make the bottom of the moon slightly higher than rest of the moon.  Also, since this was a sunrise and you are taking the images towards an urban center I would expect a warm dome of air beneath a colder front (if you look carefully, you can see a slight arc in the line, as if it&#39;s a part of a larger dome).  It appears that the temperature that night dropped to around 20 degrees Fahrenheit on the night in question.  So, the line would just be an artifact cause by light warping as it passes through from the cold front to the warm front.

So, there is a lot of red light.\r<br>2.\tThe light source (red sunlight), your cam and you and the tip of the escape system are all in line. \r<br>3.\tThe blinking warning-light on top of the rocket blinks red. I expect a white light source (maybe) with a red glass tube around.  \r<br>4.\tThe dark horizontal line on the moon has possible exact the height of the red warning light on the tip.

The intensity of the red light was reduced a lot more than green and blue\u2026I am sure this is not a coincidence!\r<br><br>I have also no idea how my observations can explain this effect.

They had installed a seismograph on the moon plus that plate with all the different languages on it and a bunch of different symbols and they also attached American flag, and I think there was something else. Well that seismograph when the launch gear was released from it from them taking off from the moon coming back to earth when it hit the Moon. It cause the moon to ring for 15 minutes or so and the seismograph to move up and down. When they reported it back to NASA NASA said jettisoned something heavier. So they did they found something else that weighed more and they jettisoned didn&#39;t let it go down to the moon this time when it hit the Moon it rang for 6 Plus hours in the seismograph was moving back and forth. You cannot find a crater on the moon that&#39;s deeper than the deepest crater. So another words whatever is under the stuff that the moon is made of. Is that the same depth! So any crater that has been slammed into by a comet meteorite, whatever. It goes to a certain point and stops. It can not go deeper than that. So, what does that tell us? Well, it tells us the possibility that the moon could possibly be an artificial satellite. The reason why I say this. Is they&#39;re looking at Mars very closely now. The big scar that goes across Mars with the big circular part in it. They&#39;ve run the test over and over again with what they think the surface of Mars is made out of and an electric Bolt every time you left a bolt strikes the same material. They believe Mars is made out of they get almost the exact same result. Round kind of hole in the middle scarring streaking out from the outside of it. So there&#39;s a possibility that we f*<b>**</b> up like we are right now. We f*<b>**</b> are planted up so bad. We would not give up nukes. We were considered a planet destroying species like we are right now. So the people that ceded Mars came along with something like a Death Star. Zapped Mars With a really highly. Voltage Electro Ray or jolt and pretty much killed everything off Mars besides the things they save to start over new planet. So the next planet closest for us would be the Earth. It&#39;s a very good possibility Earth did not have a breathable atmosphere yet. In order to do that, they had to tow a artificial satellite and put it in Earth&#39;s rotational orbit. What I did was the cause the Earth to start breathing in and out like the tides. Then eventually that led to a breathable atmosphere where we tried again. Yet here. We are still a planet destroying species still failing at our 1 mission to become enlightened. Do your research on the Apollo Landing? They&#39;ll tell you that exact story and you can read it for yourself. You asked for a thought I gave you what I have read. I&#39;ve given you the studies. I&#39;ve seen that they&#39;re trying to figure out what caused the scar on Mars so far. That&#39;s what they think happened. Also the moon the stuff on the outside of it is made. Perfectly from material to absorb strikes from asteroids and things like that. It&#39;s a good read and it&#39;s a good way to get some knowledge out there. Not just from somebody saying it online. You can get these new things that can hook onto your phone&#39;s now. They&#39;re like the Excel Zoom 3000 and you can see the craters on the moon. best of luck stay lifted stay blessed", "comment_date": "2020-03-13T23:06:53Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Samuel Cho", "comment_text": "<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9reizHjwuNY&amp;t=0m33s\">0:33</a> When you literally just killed a Lynel and a Blood Moon occurs", "comment_date": "2020-03-13T20:28:42Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "LeVI KING", "comment_text": "i would be curious to know if u see it through normal lens with eyes or if its a digital thing", "comment_date": "2020-03-13T20:23:39Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "cmac379", "comment_text": "Pssst.

This is a light reflection from the tip of the rocket, in a air of different temperatures and densities. This gives us a clue on whats going on. Next frame when tip has reached the moon, then you see diffraction at the edges of the moon where the black lines &quot;leave&quot; the moon. The line is also slightly slanted to the left. This is probably diffraction of moonlight caused by the heat of the lamp and a calm steady non-turbulent wind - blowing either directly to us or away from us at the tip. Next frames you se lamp goes off and the line gets dimmer and almost disappear when the lights come on again.<br><br><br>After that when lights goes off then the dark line appear again, but fainter. Still the edges of the moon gets a diffraction by the line. Next when light comes on again, we never se the line any more. Even it goes on and off several times before the tip enters the darkness of the moon. <br><br><br>To me this is highly probable it is heat from the lamp being blown away from the tip that creates this diffraction line because of laminar air flow that day.

It&#39;s due to the edge of the earth at its end point, you notice the line does not go completely across the hole pucture because the edge of the flat earth looking down will be a straight line until it curves, the lack of the line continueing on the picture from side to side is due to start of the earth starting to curve. Example,  if you take and draw a circle on paper you can take a straight edge and at one point you can draw a very small straight line. But because the earth is so big the line is bigger and shows up as a large straight line on the moon, reflected (light) from the glacier that surround the flat earth! The reflection in reality is round like the earth but you don&#39;t see the complete circle of reflection/refraction because the red spectrum of light from the moon is what causes the line to be seen. Another very importance is that it&#39;s a red moon and its aligned with the sun. Furthermore, the color spectrum is the only color that shows this glacier refraction of light and the line will end when the color red ends so the line stops at the outer edge of the moon. And the alinement of the rocket tip means nothing other then you brought all the pieces of an experiment together at the same time, call it a an accidental discovery!

The blood moon entails that the suns white light has passed through our atmosphere scattering the shorter wavelengths leaving only the longer, red wavelengths to be seen coming back off the moon (meaning we\u2019re essentially viewing a single wavelength which makes good conditions for viewing destructive interference). The cylinder shape explains the apparent line (rather than a circle or something else) of interference made and makes complete sense since the rocket spire is cylindrical too. Also, this cylinder may be slightly tilted on top the rocket since it was probably added just to follow regulations for tall structures coinciding with aviation which explains why the line is slightly tilted. <br><br>With the hypothesis that this is a result of destructive interference, we expect that there should be the typical interference bands, and I believe we do see them. Looking at the picture the line is darkest to the left and right of light housing and it\u2019s very faint directly behind it. Light coming straight through the cylinder won\u2019t be out of phase with itself hence no destructive interference and at some distance off to each side there will be the first point where the light coming through the cylinder is completely out phase with the light passing next to the cylinder.

Why? it is to do with the way the algorithm within each make of camera works. Nikon sensors scan horizontally (great for landscapes) and Canon sensors scan vertically (great for buildings).  You will notice that the edges of the rocket are smooth whiles the edges of the moon are stepped due to the vertical scan been much efficient at following the vertical sides of the rocket but struggles with the edges of the moon.. This is because the Canon camera scan algorithm is able to detect the vertical rocket sides accurately until that vertical rocket edges disappears. It is at that precise point the scan algorithm changers to look for more vertical edges, but there are none.

One day I was checking my trap and noticed a pile of what looked like sand. I didn&#39;t think much of it at first but I thought it was odd that I never noticed it before. I came back by the pile that was about 6 feet tall (eye level) and was very fine and not sand but finely ground limestone rock. It had no silica sand and no sparkle. It had no stones, lumps, sand, roots, just a fine powder. The pile looked like it was in an hourglass with straight sides from top to bottom and all but perfectly round and covering leaves and small weeds and it also had a small palm tree that it had flowed around. You could see where the sides had flowed and cascaded from the top just like sand in an hourglass does. I dug around the edges and found that it was indeed on top of a layer of leaves all the way around. I did the math on a cone of material 6 feet tall and 12 feet wide and came up with 226.19 cubic feet and roughly 11 tons at about 100 lbs to a cubic foot which is what crushed limestone should weigh. I took a friend and a VHS video camera to document the strange find and I may still have a tape somewhere. But I could never figure out how that pile of fine stone powder could have been placed like that way out in the swamp where no vehicles could reach. I went back another time with a shovel in an attempt to dig to the bottom to see if the pile was covering something.

Digital camera sensors often have weird so-called &quot;ISP programs&quot; which apply post-process effects like photoshop does and also control feedback for sensor settings such as gain. It is reasonable to suspect that the ISP program uses various progressive brightness and contrast measures to adjust its post-processing and that the appearance of the first very intense pixels causes the program to apply an inappropriate post-process to a few lines until a new measure of the nature of the image has incorporated those bright pixels. It&#39;s also possible that a high-end camera controls gain on a line-by-line basis based on previous images before the one that is recorded and that the control program does something inappropriate at the first line with bright pixels, other options are that the sensor has an internal gain control or a readout artifact but I don&#39;t know so much about the extent of such features that might or might not be incorporated in sensors. You can test if it&#39;s something like these things by taking pictures with the camera at different angles around the optical axis - if the line rotates with the camera then it&#39;s sensor or ISP artifacts.

That&#39;s likely because the atmosphere itself is at an angle relative to your position.

Flattened, because you are in that plane of the reflection or almost in it. So, this is a mirage. I predict a lighter band that is probably invisible with your equipment.

My wife, abortion survivor/thriver/pro-life speaker and author Carrie Yvette Fischer was asked to speak at the Life and Liberty Rally in Huntsville just prior to the 2012 election. The day before the Rally, we were asked to join several other pro-life folks at the Christian radio station to do an interview. We knew in advance it could be a very long day, because that station was only licensed for 5 minutes of talk between music...so interviews were going to be spread out for quite some time. But God had a plan to make this happen  in a different way. Just a few minutes before the interviews were to start, the station manager&#39;s wife called the radio station&#39;s wife to tell him she could no longer hear the station on the radio. A quick check of the equipment revealed that for reasons that remained unknow, the broadcast was indeed not going out. After some minutes of trying to diagnose the problem, and nothing coming from it, one of the other people there suggested that we all pray...so that is what we did. Everyone else prayed first, and when it got to me, though I normally did not pray this way at that time, but I chose to bind the principalities and powers of the air. Immediately after my prayer, though the equipment was still showing nothing was working, the station manager&#39;s wife called again and told him that she could hear the talking, but not the music.

So, just to get a feeling for things, I played with calculating a pathlength difference for a direct ray and a ray that diffracts around the edge of an object of width, d. Google maps shows the distance from the church to the rocket to be 3.5 km. It&#39;s reddish light, so let&#39;s call that 6e-7m wavelength. Mix that together and I need an object about d=3cm wide to get a half wavelength pathlength difference.  So, that is why this happens at the tip. Everything below the tip is too wide. As you go up, the obstruction width narrows until, at some point, it is just the right width to give the destructive interference. We have a spectrum of wavelengths, so this will be a smear of distance, vertically, so we get a narrow vertical band of height to serve as our obstruction.  The next question is, why do you get a band of darkness?  Somehow, that band is the locus of points of direct light canceling against the the diffracted light, but I haven&#39;t gotten a good, convincing diagram to see exactly how that is happening. But, my guts tell me it has to be a horizontal band because the diffraction is happening at a definite height (see above).

Even if it&#39;s offline, an isolinear waveguide filter could cause a spectrum (or certain band) to become visible. We&#39;re communicating well above EHF, and idk how classified the THz bands are, but you have a &quot;light&quot; interceptor that&#39;s often placed behind the nosecones of these space program systems. In the late 80&#39;s we were transmitting enough data to be equivalent to 76 sets of encyclopedias every second. DC transmissions are just man&#39;s unnatural way of bending light-wave energy at specific frequencies for communication. We use this for a variety of &quot;constantly on&quot; systems, like Doppler radar systems, or even automatic landing systems for commercial aircraft.  Also, radio frequencies are sending constant signals.  These waves seek ground, and from what I&#39;ve learned from electrical deratings (kinda like what&#39;s required for grounding rods)  . . . that high point in the air (the rocket), with a narrow tip &amp; a waveguide filter are going to lead downward to plenty of free electrons.  There is a reason RC airplanes can be controlled, and it&#39;s not magic . . . it&#39;s &quot;Science&quot;.  Picture that rocket as a huge upscaled RC plane &amp; it&#39;s supposed to have the world&#39;s most sophisticated walkie-talkie on top.  Those signals that it interrupts never end. . . and it&#39;s just sitting there interrupting signal (aka light) like it&#39;s supposed to be doing. Now your camera captures a phenomenal event when that plane of communication is visibly able to be interrupted.  Do this, it might help get rid of the confusion. Take a piece of paper &amp; write the words &quot;Cell Phone&quot; and &quot;Doppler&quot; and &quot;Radio&quot; and &quot;Space-Talk&quot; on it.  Then try flopping it up &amp; down, but keeping it flat in the air (you might need to move it like a kite) then take a pencil &amp; poke it through the bottom of the flat plane &amp; say &quot;rocket&quot;. That floppy paper is our light-wave transmissions (and that highway is getting over-packed) . . . well, the top of that rocket is able to listen . . . really good. So it breaks up some of the light &amp; is seen as a dark line.  Keep this in mind, your cellphone does not &quot;send&quot; signal, it interrupts the signal. The power (heavy lifting) is done by transmission towers. When the signal is seen (broken up) on the other side, the difference is your voice. That&#39;s how the cellphone battery can last the better part of a day  . . . it&#39;s not charging up a huge field of energy &amp; transmitting it into space like a trekkie communicator.

It is probably the brightest thing in the frame. Now, I do not know, so I am guessing here. Your camera is digital and that means that it captures the image more or less a pixel at a time. At least the image is composed of many horizontal lines of small pixel elements, and each of those is processed in series. I think. Now, suppose the camera has a some kind of exposure control. If so it will likely ramp up the &quot;sensitivity&quot; to capture the main scene. The main scene is not very bright. That bright spot might produce overexposed pixels compared to the rest of the moon. The spot maybe be large enough to subtend an area of 4 or more pixels. The camera software may process and correct sensitivity on a pixel by pixel basis, and if so, it would reduce the sensitivity of the pixels illuminated by the red light. Those pixel elements in the array would then not be &quot;sensitive&quot; enough to reproduce the moon light. Now if there is a rastering effect, scanning line by line, the software may think that the next pixels just outside the illuminated area need to be &quot;dimmed&quot; too. Depending on the timing of things, moreover, depending on the camera&#39;s internal programming, it may be creating a few horizontal lines of pixels that have reduced sensitivity and cannot capture the moon light at correct brightness. If so you end up with a line in your image.  It seems to me the camera should be designed to not do that, but this condition may be rare, and it could just be a &quot;feature&quot; they didn&#39;t quite program correctly.", "comment_date": "2019-01-29T22:21:06Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Tim Wiese", "comment_text": "I think the line is sth to stabelize the rocket while its standing there <br><br>Like the thing that slekliners hold in there hands <br><br>sry for my bad english \ud83d\ude09", "comment_date": "2019-01-29T07:11:07Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Ghost Folf02", "comment_text": "<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9reizHjwuNY&amp;t=1m49s\">1:49</a> What was that black tiny dot?", "comment_date": "2019-01-28T05:06:12Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Stephen Needham", "comment_text": "An electricity wire they&#39;re forgetting.", "comment_date": "2019-01-28T00:46:30Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Steso", "comment_text": "Just a glitch in the matrix ;)", "comment_date": "2019-01-27T18:41:50Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "YT\u30b7", "comment_text": "I was born in Huntsville Alabama", "comment_date": "2019-01-27T18:04:59Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Bruh How", "comment_text": "could be a uhhhhh frekin&#39; thing OH a glare from the light (mayybeeeeeeeeeee)", "comment_date": "2019-01-27T06:08:04Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Cringe Gaming 64", "comment_text": "THis was really cool when I saw this on the 20th<br><br>I had never seen a lunar eclipse before", "comment_date": "2019-01-26T22:16:01Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Lachlan Wyvill", "comment_text": "What rocket was that?", "comment_date": "2019-01-26T03:16:18Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Snake Doctor", "comment_text": "It&#39;s the Flat Earth shadow !!!!!!!!!", "comment_date": "2019-01-24T21:53:15Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Windoos", "comment_text": "it&#39;s the shadow of the flat earth", "comment_date": "2019-01-24T11:42:58Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Tyler 3518", "comment_text": "Yo I\u2019m in Huntsville too!", "comment_date": "2019-01-24T03:37:23Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Sam", "comment_text": "It was a wizard", "comment_date": "2019-01-24T03:19:29Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "///Ari", "comment_text": "The flat earth creates the line<br><br>duh", "comment_date": "2019-01-23T18:25:22Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Melanie amerson", "comment_text": "look its most likley  the space station or in other words the shadow of the space station that was in the way of your camera  so i mean if the space station  was on the other side then you would have missed it and gotten a better pic its not like your <br> your pic was bad but like its the space stations fault", "comment_date": "2019-01-22T19:57:35Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Jonathan Villarreal", "comment_text": "Illuminati", "comment_date": "2019-01-22T10:46:41Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Will Downs", "comment_text": "Similar to the lunar wave", "comment_date": "2019-01-21T12:24:50Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Tom Hsia", "comment_text": "Something about air, density, and refraction, I think.

They fly all over USA, 24/7, laying down contrails. At night, these contrails are usually invisible unless the Moon gets behind them.

For verses, it&#39;s often because in Latin and related languages, grammar doesn&#39;t permit sentence splits where the traditional Jewish cantillation indicates. (In Numbers 26:1, the cantillation even continues a Hebrew verse over a full paragraph break!) For chapters splits, the reason is less clear. For more than 2500 years, Jews did not number verses and chapters, until Gutenberg first printed his Bible. Like how Gutenberg split topics and imposed chapter splits onto the text, Jewish printers did the same, but they had a slightly different idea (tradition?) of where chapters should begin and end. Most of the breaks Jews use are the same as Gutenberg&#39;s, although very occasionally I see that the chapter breaks are different, aligning with the weekly Torah and Haftorah portion, or with the paragraph breaks in the Hebrew text, or sometimes for some other reason I can&#39;t discern.<br><br>For our verse in Joel, Hebrew verse 3:1 &quot;And it will happen after this, that I will pour out My spirit...&quot; comes after a gap in the line. That starts a &quot;closed&quot; paragraph (an &quot;open&quot; paragraph starts on a new line). It is true that of the two paragraph types, the closed paragraph is less disjunctive, (and even &quot;open&quot; paragraphs don&#39;t always start a new chapter,) but the phrase &quot;And it will happen after this&quot; means that some time will pass after the events in chapter 2 before the things described in chapter 3.

Where the line hits the moon edge there is a slight indentation.<br><br>My best current guess is that this is some optical artefact/phenomena related to using a camera lens in this exact setting and location with light sources behind and in front. Perhaps some sort of refraction effect. The curvature of the line could possibly be related to the roundness of the camera lens. The darker line on left could be related to there being more light incoming from that half of the moon as Saturn V cuts it into a larger and smaller half, in other words that the phenomena is stronger on the side of a stronger incoming light.<br><br>Just some thoughts.

A brighter light can overpower the light that it&#39;s supposed to be gathering. The diffraction of that light around the small hole is augmented by the aspherical lens elements. Most lenses are aspherical - shaping a round light entering the lens into a rectangular exposure frame. The key word is rectangular.

The effect fades completely once the brightest part of the moon passes the tip point. I would suspect that if an atmospheric effect of some sort were the cause the line would be continually visible through the all the stills; however, they are not. 3 the effect happens two additional times to a lesser degree as the moon passes the top and bottom of the LES truss where it connects to the rocket and the module. It&#39;s apparent that at all of those points there is a sharp angle or distinctive transition relative to the background.

I have experienced a similar effect years ago while doing electrostatic experiments with pointed objects (ion emitters) while outside, visible with the naked eye. Take this with a grain of salt in any case - I am not implying this to be the answer to this particular situation but merely suggesting what may be involved in the effect but without knowing the exact conditions of course makes it mere speculation. The saturn rocket mockup is a large metallic structure exposed vertically; on a dry day any metallic structure builds up a rather noteable electrostatic charge (especially if painted/isolated externally hence coated with a dielectric) due to sole air friction on the structure (electrons being lost or gained). If this structure is not properly earthed the buildup can be several tens of Kilovolts reaching the hundreds based on the atmospheric conditions. The point, whether conductive or not would become a high charge accumulation area which due to dry weather would not dissipate it&#39;s charge very quickly. This would affect the air around that point causing a polarization effect on the light (gradient) not pointing away from the source but equipotentially (horizontally or on a plane, similar to an EM radiation source such as a GHz wave antenna with millimeter short wavelength). This distortion is more or less visible based on the kind of optics used and the coating on your lenses (UV, scratch protection, glare filter) and it is also visible with the naked eye depending on lighting conditions. It is more visible on the lower light / IR spectrum as the air absorbs this spectrum (when excited) more than UV (may even influence Rayleigh scattering at a distance), hence creating a darker absorbption line. Looking through any DSLR camera is equivalent to looking through any optics (until the shutter and mirror are not operated) meaning that optics and optical filters come into play and may enhance any polarization effect even if there is no specific polarization filter used respect to the naked eye. The atmosphere becomes a polarized filter at certain moments of the day (dawn, sunset) apart from creating noteable light diffraction effects (ex. enlarging the sun and moon setting on the horizon). Considering the above, combining both of these conditions which were present the evening you took those shots, would certainly have created interesting optical effects. Adding to that the fact that the moon was reflecting an already &quot;preconditioned&quot; atmospherically filtered sunlight (towards the IR spectrum) from our earth&#39;s partial shadow, I must say all these conditions were rather unique and unprecedented.<br>Having said this, the effect is intriguing to say the least and the shots you took are spectacular.

I could be wrong. But the jet stream was pushing at 60 knots to the east, so by the time Destin took the photo 30 minutes later, contrail would be closer to Jonesboro.

Could it have something to do with diffraction of the Light. I mean the moon is relatively far away from the earth. So its lightrays are nearly parallel. A &quot;have-to-condition&quot; for occuring diffraction effects is parralel light if I remember right. Now that parralel light hits the tip of the rocket. It should work with a wall or any sharp edge too to produce a diffraction. I tried it with my smartphone camera and my desktoplamp. My desktoplamp uses led&#39;s and there is a milky glass in front of them so that the light is very diffuse (like the moon). Two meters away from that lamp i did put a sharp pencil in vertical position glued to the desk. Another 2 meters away I tried to align my smartphonelense with the pencil and the lamp (zoomed in), to produce your setup. Then I wiggled my smartphone a bit around. I observed the following:  When the tip of the pencil started hitting the lower edge of the diffuse lamp (entering the light), the edge of the Lamp seemed to bend a little bit inwards towards the tip of the pencil. The same happened when the penciltip started leaving the light of the lamp again. Then the upper edge of the lamp seemed to bend a little bit inward to the penciltip.

From the angle Destin to the tip of the Saturn 5, we can extrapolate a minimum and maximum distance of any aircraft that may be causing the contrails:<br><br>Dmin = 15000 / atan(1.68\u00b0) = 511,700 feet = 96.91 miles<br>Dmin = 40000 / atan(1.68\u00b0) = 1,365,000 feet = 258.5 miles<br><br>At <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9reizHjwuNY&amp;t=06m35s\">06:35</a> (<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9reizHjwuNY&amp;t=12m35s\">12:35</a> UTC), there were several aircraft in the vicinity that flew past the line extrapolated from Destin&#39;s position:  JIA5081, AAL93, SWA1658, SWA497, and other miscellaneous flights.  However, after examining each flight profile (using the intersection of the flight path with the extrapolated line of sight, then using d * atan(1.68 degrees) to determine expected altitude), none of these aircraft come even close to the extrapolated line, even accounting for variations in viewing angle, flight path deviations, and other environmental factors.<br><br>Just from this, I can conclude that (provided there were no other aircraft that FlightRadar24 didn&#39;t see) this line is not a contrail.  There must be some other phenominon causing this.  Infrared satellite imagery from GOES-R suggests a layer of high altitude clouds.

If it was possibly a hologram, or for some reason having some holographic nature to what we visibly see, it would make sense to me that this could happen. The one unique thing about the tip of the that Saturn 5 replica, is the red flashing light. Its very clear that is the exact point of disruption; as well as the line created being roughly the same thickness as the light is tall. So my guess would be that the lense of that light is distorting the light coming from the hologram, therefore creating a &quot;shadowing&quot; effect from your optical point of view. Its essentially refracting the light in just the right way where the light being emittied in that section is either being convexly or concavely dispersing the artificial light coming from the moon. Or maybe that same effect could happen naturally.

Basically, Destin is viewing the scene through an optical telescope. The only thing between Destin&#39;s eye and the lens is a mirror that acts as the shutter. When the photo is taken, the mirror moves out of the way so the sensor has full, unobstructed light. This works the same way for an SLR camera using photo sensitive film also. If the line is caused by micro scratches on the mirror, it would not show up in the image. If it was a digital image artifact, Destin would not see it in the view-finder. The common objects used by both Destin and the imaging sensor is the lens itself, and of course the atmosphere and optics going on in the scene. It could be a lens artifact, but Destin has commented that it showed up in two other cameras. The odds of all three lenses having the same cleaning smudges are almost impossible. Besides, the line would &quot;shimmer&quot;  as the lens/camera is moved if it was a smudge or micro-scratches on the lens.<br><br>P.S.

This implies that the line occurs at significant distance relative to even the rocket.  The slope of the line seems to match the slope of the ground, so it would make sense for it to be an &quot;altitude&quot; based phenomena.<br><br>Could this be a density/internal reflection thing?  The moon light (which has been reduced to the red wavelength) is shining through a thin layer of atmosphere with a sharp change in density due to the early morning calm or a sharp temperature inversion (perhaps from an invisible layer of condensation).  A line of light is getting caught in this density shift where it experiences total internal reflection (like planar sheet of fiber-optic cable).  It then follows the curvature of the layer exactly, unable to escape and shine through.  Only light entering at the critical angle gets caught, sub critical angles are refracted and super critical angles are reflected and are invisible.  The half of the moon visible the below the line is actually bending up from the denser air below the density discontinuity (having entered at a sub critical angle, then refracted), but the two images don&#39;t <b>quite</b> match up and so we see the line.  The redness may be a factor here too: due to the light being mostly red, there is only one critical angle, instead of a continuous spectrum (which would have resulted in a blending of colors across multiple lines... softening the effect and spreading it out over the image).  This is kind of like how the moon/sun are egg shaped near sunset.  But you never see a line at sun set because the sun light is too hot to leave the air calm and still like you find just before sunrise.<br><br>If I&#39;m right, you&#39;d expect to see this again if the air is calm and/or there&#39;s a sharp density shift at altitude.

It\u2019s crocked because the dude who installed it was having a bad day or it has since gotten misaligned from level due to bird or drone strikes\u2026 Get the spec on the light or fly your drone up there to take a look at that lens and you will have your answer\u2026<br>Stephan \ud83d\udc97", "comment_date": "2018-02-04T23:11:48Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "fastcompjason", "comment_text": "I believe that it likely  has something to do with the significant contrast differential between the background lighting level of the moon in the shot and the tip of the rocket both with the red light ON and the red light OFF (the moon in background is roughly either twice as bright as tip with light off and roughly half as bright when the light is on)? I know that the different imaging sensors and methods for capturing the photonic loads on each pixel per shutter cycle can cause image aberrations in the captured image. These photographic anomalies are usually seen in horizontal scan lines  used in recording interlaced video, but can be seen in multi-process resultant images caused from either camera sensor capture method then passed to the camera internal image processing then stored to disk. This photographic artifacting is called &quot;stepping&quot; (not to be confused with &quot;color banding&quot;) and is also usually indicative of a line scanning camera mode and also usually seen more during low lighting levels as this is where the &quot;noise&quot; is higher due to the straining of the camera sensor pixels to capture low light during the allowed light collection time of the shutter speed or frame rate (no shuttering). As you are usually shooting video for your channel, were you shooting in video mode or trying to get an actual still photo? As you were shooting in lower light, and the lights were on at the Rocket Center and driven at US standard 60Hz, do you think that there was a rolling strobe effect due to the camera shutter likely being higher (even slightly) than the 60Hz of the lighting of the tip of the rocket?", "comment_date": "2018-02-04T23:11:06Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "David Eidem", "comment_text": "Have you tried removing the tip of the rocket from the image?

Just checked - the effect appears at <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9reizHjwuNY&amp;t=1m05s\">1:05</a> as you&#39;re showing the rising moon - just its normal full self. There are no lines evident as such, but the edge of the image is notched, and it looks like the notches line up edge-to-edge horizontally across the moon&#39;s image. My guess is that the alignment with the top of the rocket was accidental, which would fit with the same effect not showing up from a different location. If the air high up where you were filming was relatively calm with little to no convection going on, I could imagine that the temperature variations would become stratified at night, similar to the situation in the stratosphere (or for that matter the effect could be arising in the stratosphere, since you are looking through it). The variation in temperature would of course lead to a variation in refractive index of the light and hey presto! mirage effect. Filming on a cold night may be a factor?<br><br>The interesting thing would be to know if there is some way you could verify this. Salt solutions with different densities seem to be able to do something similar, so you might be able to set up a simulation??...
