(I&#39;m going to derail others if not myself... so back to my current observation concerning my thoughts this morning and the precise serendipitous-nous of seeing this video, which is to say, &quot;I digress&quot;.)<br><br>While lying there, I was thinking of &quot;1/400,000,000 of an inch&quot; (one - four hundred millionth of an inch) as (possibly being in the neighborhood of the measurement of &quot;the machinery of DNA&quot;, which I mentioned. (It just seemed like a good guess... I haven&#39;t looked it up yet).<br><br>I won&#39;t try and guess how much time I spent thinking about the little I know of DNA but I was definitely categorizing all of the functioning going on down there, as nothing more than the necessary means for creating temporary, &quot;physical&quot; habitations for human beings and other (actual life); recalling that, the Hebrew&#39;s History of man includes a brief description of a slight (actually, most-likely very huge) variation in the formation of the human being compared to all other life; that being, &quot;He formed man from the (minerals/particles... dust) of the earth&quot;. (We were -FORMED-). Whereas, in the case of all of creation mentioned before man, (man being last), all was spoken into existence; He said, &quot;Let there be...&quot;. And, before &quot;forming&quot; man, He said, &quot;Let us make him in our image; the image of the Living Creator.&quot;<br><br>Then, I brushed it all away, made my breakfast and went about my day, without a single thought of DNA... until I saw the video title, &quot;How to Measure to a MILLIONTH of an Inch (The Dawn of Precision)&quot; and I couldn&#39;t resist! And, of course, the true &quot;Dawn of Precision&quot;, is the Dawn of time... And the sponsor of this video is all about DNA.<br>This is &quot;unpredictable, serendipitous precision&quot;!

NIST gave us a reference piece to check the accuracy of our machine, but where we could measure fractions of the wavelength of light with our laser interferometer, their reference piece could only be guaranteed to be close, and if their random measurements happened to be at places which were a full wavelength, or a multiple, apart, they couldn&#39;t tell if it was the same height or a wavelength or more away. Our platform was a 4&#39;x4&#39; granite slab that rested on four inner tubes to isolate it from the floor. However, if someone walked down the nearby hallway, we could detect their footfalls. If someone rested their finger, say, or a pencil, on the edge of the slab, we could measure the resulting deflection of the granite. It was an awesome project, using some of the latest technology (like the then brand-new Motorola 68000 chip - it was so new, there were no operating systems for it, so we wrote our own just to get started.) Once we measured the tips of the triangle that formed the laser gyro, and the pieces that fit on the ends, the pieces where so flat that they would bond together by molecular adhesion when you touched the two pieces together. It was one of the cooler things i have personally worked on in my career. Accuracy for the laser gyro was such that a plane could fly around the world navigating with it and return within 20 feet of the start of its journey. It was very cool. I believe we published the article about it in Laser Focus magazine, but this was 25 years or so before HTML, the world-wide web, and online publishing.

What makes this significant for me is this is the first real calculation I&#39;ve ever done on a calculator using Reverse Polish Notation instead of the classic algebraic type notation most calculators use. So I could be wrong in my math. I estimated how long it took for the round to make a quarter rotation and multiplied that by 4 to get the 2.68ms then multiplied that by 1000 and took the inverse of that to get the rotations per second. Then just multiplied by 60 for RPM. Somebody please correct me if I&#39;m mistaken. I just thought it was an interesting figure. Now I&#39;d like to work out what sort of G forces that round would experience with that rotational speed.<br>EDIT: Well after watching the rest of it, I guess the answer came later.

TLDR!).<br><br>Honestly guys, I may not know much in the way of information security or its implications but I&#39;m pretty sure we need to know the full extent of what we use on a day to day basis before we start pointing fingers and shouting murder at something new that doesn&#39;t really require you to do it but uses data that&#39;s already available and ties it up to that repository.<br><br>To summarise, chances are if you thought of how DNA could be a major identity exploit, a hundred other people up above who considered making secure systems using this data have done so too, making it a scrapped concept long before this video or 23andme ever was a thing. Systems cannot be made secure with pins that don&#39;t change regularly and are randomised (neither of which the human DNA sequence is, leaving SNPs which themselves have similarities over a lineage, making the concept even more meaningless).<br>The HGP (the superproject Destin didn&#39;t discuss in this video) is the very reason we&#39;ve been able to completely map the human genome bit by bit. It used hundreds of thousands, possibly millions of those chips to accomplish such a feat. It was so bogglingly huge, the project started decades ago and only finished sometime after the turn of the millennium.<br><br>So no, DNA is not an identifier and never will be.

It&#39;s very hard to find the contact point repeatably with a design like this that&#39;s multiple multipliers removed from the point of contact.

Sort of like if you take a micrometer that measures down to 50 millionths of an inch... you will rarely get a repeatable measurement to that spec on anything that isn&#39;t 100% contact like a gage block.

Her parents are farmers but in the last 3 years, her mother had to go to another city to make money where is 500 miles far from home because farming doesn\u2019t bring a good income. Her dad  is a construction worker (he still does farming in free time) but in Vietnam this job is just building house, small house. This time in Vietnam is rain season so they can\u2019t build house because of weather, so her dad just stays home, so all the income depends on farming. (please don\u2019t be confused that farming makes good money because they are  in Vietnam, one family has a field about 40.000 square feet, they grow rice on it and after 4 months they harvest about 1.8 tons of rice, 1 tons of rice costs 300$ and One year they harvest twice which means they make 1080$ a year from growing rice for 8 months, average 135$/month in Gross.

Eventually, you won&#39;t be able to ram a bullet down the bore. That was not due to poor maintaining of a weapon, as it could happen during a long battle.<br>Rifling was originally invented to give a place for that residue to go, allowing more time between cleanups.<br>Eventually, somebody figured out it was easier to broach the bore while twisting it. Then they noticed guns done this way were particularly more accurate. And they had no idea why. All they knew was that the twisted grooves made the bullet spin on it&#39;s axis, but they had no idea why that made it more accurate.<br>Legends even tell of one of those rifles outperforming a smoothbore firing silver bullets marked with a cross and blessed my a priest, but that&#39;s probably a myth.<br>Then, Illuminism happened and scholars set out to figure out exactly what made them more precise. Up until then, a soldier was expected to hit his target at 50 (45ish meters), was considered lucky to hit anything at 100yd (91m) and the soldier who was hit at or beyond 150 yd was extremely unlucky.<br>Rifling changed that, reportedly allowing killshots at 1000yds. The Sharpshooter was born, a man who could decide a battle with a single shot to the right target.

New products and technology seem to  explode into being when it comes of age. Silicon Valley. There&#39;s little hot spots all over the world that create our almost irresistible progress.
