Firstly, colognes usually consist of notes that evaporate at different rates.  The smell of a good fragrance evolves as you wear it. So spraying it on and having  her immediately smell it doesn&#39;t mean she likes or hates the fragrance as a whole it likely means she likes the top notes.<br><br>Secondly,  colognes are affected by temperature. So a cologne that&#39;s delightful in the winter might be horrid in the summer. Thusly your application of the cologne will affect the fragrance as well. It&#39;s best to apply weak colognes to warmer areas of the body and stronger fragrances to cooler areas of the body. <br><br>Lastly, I hope she decided on Creed Aventus...
