What should be the focus is housing as many as possible.  Because, as you said, many, many thousands are in need.  They don&#39;t need jungle gyms, technology (except to learn with), they don&#39;t even need shoes.  (In fact feet are much stronger and offer much more support if shoeless.)  All they need is safety, security and compassion which you have well provided.  They should not be fed white rice.  brown rice, being unrefined is probably cheaper!  White rice is devoid of nutrition.  Starting them off with good food habits will add decades to their lifespan.  I don&#39;t know if you&#39;re growing food there but if not that would be great to integrate the children with.  Growth in nature gives us hope and those kids need hope.  Its just so very therapeutic.  I would think just getting out of the city into such a serene environment you&#39;ve provided would do wonders for their psyche.  We so often take nature and all that God has so richly provided, for granted.", "comment_date": "2022-07-22T00:03:38Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "jimeylee", "comment_text": "Nice work man!", "comment_date": "2022-07-07T10:11:23Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "future1983", "comment_text": "Why are you doing this in foreign country to alien people?

Watching this video today, on February 26, 2022 made me forget - for 10 minutes - the horrible reality of one my neighbouring countries - where the completely opposite is taking place now, real time - based on one ego-maniac&#39;s unfounded paranoia and unquenchable power-psychosis, where the aggressive forces of one country are killing people inside another country - where the only &quot;wrongdoing&quot; of the ones being killed - is living peacefully in their own country. Today, me being 40, will for the first time in my life donate medical supplies - to some of those on the planet currently in need the most. I don&#39;t know if I will feel the same kind of positivity for the rest of my life - but I just can&#39;t not do it. Well Done, Destin - for attempting to convince the world, again and again, that we the people here on earth - aren&#39;t evil, after all.

Meaning, the charity will help out with legitimate issues and needs, but will also indoctrinate people into whatever particular mythology the charity gets support from whether it\u2019s Christianity, Mormonism, Islam, etc. That\u2019s why every time I donate I always give to places like Doctors without Borders and other charities where I know man-made mythology will not be pushed onto any individual.
