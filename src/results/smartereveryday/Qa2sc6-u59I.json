I think you need a more precise mechanism for knocking dominoes over; something with a consistent speed and something that will hit the dominoes in a consistent spot on the dominoes. I feel like the varying speed at which you knock the first one over, will affect the overall speed of all of them falling. As well hitting them at the same spot is important, for the reason you noticed how the dominoes twisted and untwisted as they fell. I have a feeling if you were able to knock the first one over with force that was even or hit the centre of the first domino, that twisting would be eliminated (or lessened).<br><br>Second is the timing. Instead of having one camera that needs to travel, can you setup two cameras. You would have them pointed at the last and first (or 10 dominoes in from the first) and sync the camera footage with some sort of laser device. I am thinking using mirrors and prism you would have a single laser beam split into two directions which each camera could capture, send a quick laser burst, while the cameras are filming. You would then be able to sync the two footage streams, and time how long it takes x milliseconds for y amount dominoes it takes to fall over. This way you wouldn&#39;t need to try and capture all the dominoes with a moving camera, and you would only be concerned when the first and last domino was hit, vs finding when each domino hits. You wouldn&#39;t have found the twisting effect you mentioned but you would be able to have a real number to compare between two data sets.", "comment_date": "2018-06-30T07:15:32Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "erik61801", "comment_text": "i thought the rovers were the size of like a shoe box!", "comment_date": "2018-06-30T06:55:49Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Rupam Singha", "comment_text": "Why can&#39;t we build a electric rocket but in very small size like 5 inches or 10 inches?<br>And make available those Rockets for everyone with camera and own wifi attachment, so that every normal human being can Explore the universe with their own eyes?", "comment_date": "2018-06-29T21:13:33Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "joshGerbwrecked", "comment_text": "So facinating.

I&#39;d do anything to help your channel get even better than it already is, which personally I think is a quiet hard possibility since your channel has become my favorite channel here on YouTube very quickly and also in my opinion the best! Although your channel is great there&#39;s one thing I&#39;ve been wondering about, and that&#39;s why you don&#39;t put links in the description to the videos at the end of each video.
