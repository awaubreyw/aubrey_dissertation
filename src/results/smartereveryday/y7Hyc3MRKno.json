Even with the fan causing turbulence, the final director of the stream is the way the small ports in the face plate are drilled.  As such, the water should come out in a straight line, in keeping with how the port is drilled.  Even if the faceplate was to spin like the fan blade does.... that doesn&#39;t explain what&#39;s happening to the water streams.  How are they braiding together like in the video?

To control who gets water when, the irrigation district employees would go around and adjust the gates along the ditches and canals. We had a couple of swimming holes where some of those gates were right by a small bridge. We would swim up under the bridge, where there was almost a circular &quot;lazy river&quot; created by the flow from the gates. If the gate height was just right, then the water spilling over was laminar. We would often back up towards this laminar spillover and when it reflected off the back of our heads, it would create a pocket of air (just like in your fountain)  and we could just sit there and breath the air from the pocket.

The super-strong waterproof <br>tape! That can instantly patch, bond, <br>seal, and repair! Flex tape is no ordinary <br>tape; its triple thick adhesive virtually <br>welds itself to the surface, instantly <br>stopping the toughest leaks. Leaky <br>pipes can cause major damage, but <br>Flex Tape grips on tight and bonds <br>instantly! Plus, Flex Tape&#39;s powerful <br>adhesive is so strong, it even works <br>underwater! Now you can repair leaks in <br>pools and spas in water without draining <br>them! Flex Tape is perfect for marine, <br>campers and RVs! Flex Tape is super <br>strong, and once it&#39;s on, it holds on tight! <br>And for emergency auto repair, Flex <br>Tape keeps its grip, even in the toughest <br>conditions! Big storms can cause big <br>damage, but Flex Tape comes super <br>wide, so you can easily patch large <br>holes. To show the power of Flex Tape, <br>I sawed this boat in half! And repaired <br>it with only Flex Tape! Not only does <br>Flex Tape&#39;s powerful adhesive hold the <br>boat together, but it creates a super <br>strong water tight seal, so the inside is <br>completly dry! Yee-doggy! Just cut, peel, <br>stick and seal! Imagine everything you <br>can do with the power of Flex Tape!", "comment_date": "2020-05-13T18:25:12Z", "likes_count": 69}, {"comment_by": "Just some Kid", "comment_text": "Is it weird that I know how to pee laminar flow", "comment_date": "2020-05-13T07:53:26Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Andrea Maldonado", "comment_text": "Destin destroying a pool for science is so chaotic", "comment_date": "2020-05-13T05:02:52Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Michael Harrison", "comment_text": "&quot;i like this a lot&quot; <br>me too bro.", "comment_date": "2020-05-13T02:22:57Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Daniela Arias", "comment_text": "You don\u2019t have idea how thankful I am for this video", "comment_date": "2020-05-13T02:09:33Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Elliot Finn", "comment_text": "It is not even hard to make it, I literally poured milk for my sister&#39;s cereal and it was laminar flow!

I know in some high draw commercial gas appliances a corrugated flexible supply is not acceptable, because the spinning it causes on the gas flow prevents the burner from operating as it was designed, reducing efficiency and potentially causing an error on appliances with micro-controlled fail-safes. Thusly many have to be rigid piped all the way to the appliance with smooth bore, full bore piping, and for similar reasons, when we cut pipe, it is to be reamed to full bore, to reduce turbulence.<br><br><br>In plumbing (professionally at least) there is a goal to reduce hard 90 degree turns in an effort to reduce turbulence. Geometry is certainly an important factor in physics. Really there is a lot about physics in plumbing. Most people don&#39;t really consider the amazing wonder that it actually is to move media through a pipe, but a lot of people find out what can go wrong lol.", "comment_date": "2019-12-28T11:15:00Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "southern shop", "comment_text": "I discovered laminar flow as a child playing with the water hose., but I didnt know what it was", "comment_date": "2019-12-28T09:39:05Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Hector Gonzalez", "comment_text": "Hate to be that guy but, isn\u2019t that science project a better demonstration of the Bernoulli effect?", "comment_date": "2019-12-28T07:05:15Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "dtown902", "comment_text": "You did it!

It&#39;s literally in your veins. Blood is a relatively thick fluid that flows through comparatively narrow passageways. As such, laminar flow is used to model blood flow through all but the thickest blood vessels, such as the aorta, where flow is a bit more turbulent due to higher pipe diameter and higher flow velocity..<br><br>In fact, heart &quot;murmurs&quot; which can be used to detect things like elevated cardiac output or even a damaged heart valve are often higher than normal turbulent flow in the aorta. <br><br>But even things like anemia can be suspected from higher turbulent flow. That&#39;s because anemic blood is thinner than normal blood, due to lower red blood cell count. Simultaneously, the heart will increase its output to try to compensate for the lower oxygen carrying capacity of blood, resulting in even higher cardiac outflow rate. Put the two together and above baseline turbulent flow in the aorta becomes almost inevitable.<br><br>Also, as a child, we also a shopping centre that had a fountain with one of those &quot;mushroom&quot; laminar flow cupolas.

My theory for this actually comes from you mentioning inverse square law as sound dissipates until reaching equilibrium. Your regular voice would normally be perceived as quieter moving away from you in a normal environment, however, the water dome acted somewhat as an amplifier. The sound from you talking was directed towards the dome and once inside they bounced off the water walls into the microphone which inhibited, for the most part, them from spreading out too far in regular situations where inverse square law takes effect. However, the water did lower the quality of your voice as some sound was never in direct coarse with the water dome and some also bounced off causing a percentage of the sound to never reach the microphone therefor decreasing the quality. This is all speculation, however I thought you might like it, if you ever read it. <br>Keep up the awesome videos that I can always reference in real life situations.", "comment_date": "2019-06-17T06:57:42Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "the0cool0guy", "comment_text": "I thought I learnt laminar and turbulent flow complete with partial differential equations 8 years ago when I was undergrad.

Outside the clean room, typical airborne dust levels are over 50,000 particles per cubic meter.  See if you can find a demo cleanroom where a room is filled with smoke from a fog machine with the flow off, then the ventilation is started and the room quickly has the fog drop out the floor as perfectly clear air fills the space from the top down.<br><br>For laminar flow fountains, there are plans online to build laminar fountain jets.  Look one up.  The design is built to reduce drag on the water at the edges so the center of the flow is not traveling faster in the jet resulting in turbulence.  Water from pipes and hoses has drag on the edges so the center of the flow is traveling considerably faster than the perimeter resulting in the rapid breakup of the flow into beads.", "comment_date": "2019-05-11T23:28:11Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Zane McElroy", "comment_text": "From GA.

Hence, causing it to be turbulent?<br>What&#39;s even more confusing to me is that in the book, the top part of the equation is called &quot;inertia term,&quot; which, I guess, is the amount of water moved from one place to another. Isn&#39;t that exactly what a giant funnel with a larger hole supposed to do? How does it make it less turbulent towards the end of the stream?<br><br><br>See, it seems to make sense to me without the equation. Laminar flow is when water flows neatly through a pipe. Bumps in the pipe (or in this case, the uneven hole in the pool) will cause the water to move around, making chaotic pressure within the flow. Hence why the straw solves that, and makes it laminar at the beginning of the flow. However, since the water is aimed upwards, there are multiple things, like gravity, that causes the water to break apart towards the end of the stream. So, a funnel + a longer pipe, will increase pressure, making it flow faster, allowing it to ignore gravity, correct? So how does Reynolds number tie in here?", "comment_date": "2019-03-17T11:46:35Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Roman", "comment_text": "Laminar flow", "comment_date": "2019-03-17T06:40:45Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Nada Inspire", "comment_text": "theres more fun thing to this. i used to make a complete umbrella when playing with water hose under the rain as a kid.", "comment_date": "2019-03-17T04:48:45Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "comedy_ goldman", "comment_text": "Use flex tape to close it", "comment_date": "2019-03-17T03:32:33Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Kristian Thick", "comment_text": "Destin: &quot;I&#39;m gonna start the laminar flow video by stabbing holes in my own pool which different sized sharp objects, that&#39;ll do the job&quot;", "comment_date": "2019-03-17T02:51:48Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Michael Alan Gambill", "comment_text": "Something to consider...apart from Laminare flow...which, agreed, is awesome.

Laminar flow air is really useful in creating a sterile environment to work in, we have laminar flow culture cabinets. Air is drawn in through a filter, then the cabinet produce very smooth air flow from the top of the cabinet to the bottom in a vertical configuration. There are horizontal configurations as well that blow from the back of the hood to the front, while these may better protect the sample when we\u2019re working with blood samples etc they don\u2019t provide as much user protection as vertical configurations. We turn the air flow on, and the smooth air flow basically forces all the contamination in the air, viruses, bacteria, etc, on to the stainless steel bottom of the hood. We spray the whole bottom surface in disinfectant, leave it for 20 minutes (because it needs time to kill all the bugs), wipe down, spray in 70% ethanol, leave for another 10 minutes. During this process we also have on the ultra violet lamp that\u2019s installed inside the cabinet that also helps sterilise the bottom surface. So by utilising the laminar flow of the air we can essentially sterilise the air, and the surface we\u2019re working on as much as we can, so we can then work with cell cultures without contamination.

In analyzers, particularly blood analyzers, one of the more common techniques is to use laminar flow to test blood samples. They use a higher viscosity, non soluble fluid running as a sheath material that serves the purpose of focusing the blood sample to a very narrow stream. In addition to focusing, the laminar flow basically creates a disposable tube that keeps random cells from adhering to the equipment, and causing contamination from sample to sample, as the cells to be analyzed never touch the actual machine. So when you go to the doctor and they do a complete blood count, there is a very high chance that your numbers were derived in part using laminar flow technology", "comment_date": "2019-02-03T11:04:06Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Torkild Ratcliffe", "comment_text": "\u00abppl send me tweets from all over the internet\u00bb", "comment_date": "2019-02-03T10:50:38Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Sami Dar", "comment_text": "I was at DetroitAirport and saw the fountain one week ago!!!

Additionally the tunnel length scale was very large at like 5 ft. <br><br>I love turbulent flow as laminar flow is boring and predictable. Turbulent flow requires statistical analysis and turbulence modeling and makes our analysis significantly more interesting. Turbulent flow remains attached longer this appearing more \u201csticky\u201d. We see surface friction increase and form drag decrease. The perfect trade off study.

I already have a benefit you did not,,, the video has a refresh rate, 30 fps, 60 fps, 120 fps.  The drops are already hinting at surface tension droplets.  Laminar flow over a wing&#39;s surface is difficult to achieve, and sometimes can be made to happen with specific airfoil shapes OR  micrp pores that are under negative pressure to &#39;clean&#39; the skin of the air foil by sucking op the turbulence before it can get cracking.  The honey IS a laminar flow,, which will exhibit a thinning of the stream as the stream is subjected to the acceleration of gravity..

They controlled the water level in the pond with a railroad tie dam and added or removed a tie to maintain water level as rainfall overfilled the pond, or it started to dry up.  As kids when they added a tie it cut quite a bit of flow off so we would sit under the water coming over.  It was a cool spot to sit in as you could get under the water and not get wet and see right through as it was a laminar flow.

There are lots of fluid dynamic principles applied when studying how blood follows through arteries at high pressure.

Hence increasing the chance of blood clotting according to Virchow&#39;s triad. This can precipitate a chain of events leading to a formation of a venous clot, myocardial infarction or heart attack.

The feeling of that hot water massaging you was incredible. Just a few months ago I built myself a Burkey water filter out of two 16 qt pots from Walmart for over a week I laddled the water out of it because I was looking for the perfect spigot with a laminar for and I found one on Amazon. It is so awesome. I love getting water out of it. I just love to watch it. For like 2 weeks my wife thought I was the biggest weirdo because I was going crazy getting water out it and talking about how cool the laminar flow is coming out of this spigot.  I make lemonade from our tree in the back yard and I love putting the pitcher on the floor and just watch it full up. I always try to use our big pitcher so I can watch it longer.

Not quite.<br><br>In order to understand the difference between Laminar and Turbulent flow, one needs to examine the Momentum Flux within the flowing fluid. There are two main types of transport mechanisms that act perpendicular to the direction of flow.<br><br>In laminar flow the transport mechanism for momentum flux is driven by molecular diffusion which gives rise to viscous effects.<br><br>In turbulent flow there is additional transport mechanism for momentum flux called the Reynolds Stresses which is essentially the action of eddies and swirls within the flow regime.<br><br>As you point out in the Video, the Reynolds Number, which is a dimensionless quantity provides us with an indication as to which transport mechanism is more prevalent or important in a particular flow situation. The Standard Reynolds Number (Re=Dvp/u) refers to circular cross sections (ie cylindrical pipes) and values for Re&lt;2100 is considered laminar flow (Reynolds Stresses are zero). <br><br>The situation becomes even more complicated if one examines what is happening in a Turbulent flow situation near the inner surface of the Pipe. A sub laminar flow layer exists close to the pipe wall, and the more turbulent the bulk fluid flow conditions are, the thinner this laminar flow layer is. (it&#39;s one of the reasons bio-fouling occurs in the food and marine industries. In cases of turbulent flow bacterial colonies form on the inner surface of pipes and other material structures. These bacterial colonies can grow and form biofilms in laminar flow conditions at the surface, protected from the high shear turbulent flow that exists deeper within the bulk fluid.)<br><br>If you look at the fluid flow equations that need to be solved for Turbelent flow conditions (ie the Navier Stokes Equations), there are rare flow cases which can produce analytical solutions to these equations. Numerical finite element methods are used to solve these equations. The equations for Laminar flow on the other hand can be solved for specific geometries such as circular cross sections (cylindrical pipes).", "comment_date": "2019-01-29T13:44:32Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Sailor Memes", "comment_text": "Very impressed by the science fair project.

I can relate to this subjectively too.

I do this not only because it&#39;s a more effective way to move, but also because it&#39;s a much safer way to move, and it feels really good. Turbulence in motion = injury risk + less pleasure. The result of this kind of practice, is not only in the appearance of a smooth and flowing motion, but the physical reality of one as well, as momentum is transferred from the feet and legs, through the core, up the spine and out of the upper limbs all while deliberately cultivating the minimum amount of turbulence in the quality of the movements.

Now you can repair leaks in pools and spas in water without draining them! Flex Tape is perfect for marine, campers and RVs! Flex Tape is super strong, and once it&#39;s on, it holds on tight! And for emergency auto repair, Flex Tape keeps its grip, even in the toughest conditions! Big storms can cause big damage, but Flex Tape comes super wide, so you can easily patch large holes. To show the power of Flex Tape, I sawed this boat in half! And repaired it with only Flex Tape! Not only does Flex Tape\u2019s powerful adhesive hold the boat together, but it creates a super strong water tight seal, so the inside is completly dry! Yee-doggy! Just cut, peel, stick and seal!

But I don\u2019t know if this is the only application of canards and I\u2019d like to know more.<br><br>laminar flow pertaining to aircraft canards could be an interesting video. I know I\u2019d appreciate it quite a bit.<br><br>Love your channel, keep up the good work!", "comment_date": "2019-01-28T03:10:46Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Arshaq Habib", "comment_text": "We finally see his obsessive side", "comment_date": "2019-01-28T03:09:50Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Fang Jiunn Ewe", "comment_text": "I immediately thought of the Chicago Water Tower Place fountains when you talked about fountains and I&#39;m happy you liked our fountain no you may not touch the water but everyone does anyway so sure go ahead", "comment_date": "2019-01-28T03:09:37Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Atermagister", "comment_text": "<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7Hyc3MRKno&amp;t=6m45s\">6:45</a>...

Let&#39;s assume your straw has a diameter of 6mm. The roughness coefficient of your straw would be roughly .0025. The relative pipe roughness would be (.0025)/6=.000416. Let&#39;s suppose the hole you poked had the roughness described on the diagram: &quot;iron, cast: 0.15&quot; that would make your relative roughness =.025. Let&#39;s, for the sake or argument, estimate the velocity of the water is approximately .5 meters per second. With the above variables, and assumed temp of 20 C, your Re for the water is about 3000.

Keep with me: <br><br>According to Fox and Mcdonald on the book Fluid Mechanics, laminar flow occurs only when Reynolds number is under about 2300. Let&#39;s do the math with some assumptions (Re=pvD/M): for water p=1000kg/m^3 and M= 1,0030x10^-3 Pa.s Ok, I estimated the diameter of you plastic straw on something about 5,5mm (0,0055m). Now I only miss the velocity of the flow. Using Bernoulli\u2019s equation with some simplification [ v=(2gz)^(1/2) ] being g the gravity acceleration (9,81m/s^2) and z the high of the water column that I estimated based on the image that the water is about 30cm (0,30m) higher than the hole, the velocity of the flow is something about 2,426 m/s (about two and a half meters per second). This way, the Reynolds number is something about 13303 and the flow is already turbulent. \r<br><br>For the bigger plastic straw (8mm and 40cm water column) Re = 22344\r<br><br>And watching the flow on that science project you can see the layers of the flow shaking between them.\r<br><br>Laminar flow occurs when a fluid flows in parallel layers, with no disruption between the layers.\r<br><br>I remember that my Fluid Mechanics teacher says something when he build his wind tunnel for the university that the flow on that wind tunnel wasn\u2019t laminar, it was just a flow with good quality. Might that be the case in here?

This topic is amazing and I deal with it everyday with my current job. Laminar flow is used extensively in the pharmaceutical manufacturing industry as well. Laminar flow systems have to be finely tuned and designed to reduce turbulence as the air flows over any objects or people in the room. Any people working in this  environment also have to be aware and not move fast at all since that will disturb the air further. I had the awesome opportunity of being involved in a project where manufactured product was being moved from one cart to another and the worker (based on the laminar air flow direction) had to pick up the tray and turn around 180 degrees to the left keeping the tray of product upstream of his body. This ensured that air NEVER came in contact with his body and then the product resulting in contamination. When these systems are designed they do extensive &quot;flow studys&quot; that follow the worker going through the processes while giving them a smoke &quot;shower&quot; to visualize whether or not the flow is acceptable for that step in the process. These studys are awesome and I&#39;m sure you could find video examples on YouTube!

Do you see a lavender (purple) tube being drawn? That&#39;s likely going to be used for a CBC. Modern analyzers use flow cytometry. In essence, your blood is surrounded by another fluid that creates a sheath around it, and it is smoothed and thinned to the point where there is (ideally) one cell passing the detectors at a time. The analyzer can then use electrical resistance, optical scatter patterns, and fluorescent (among other types of) labeling to calculate what kind of cell is passing by. It gives us your red and white blood cell counts, as well as platelet counts, and can differentiate the types of white blood cells. Most analyzers can also figure out how mature your cells are and flag suspected unusual results. This is the type of test that will help determine if you&#39;re suffering from things like anemia, leukemia, thrombocytopenia, or many other types of illness involving your blood.", "comment_date": "2019-01-27T14:26:37Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Gary T", "comment_text": "And now I have a word for it, at last! <br><br>When my 30 yo son was a few weeks old, he became intolerant to his formula milk.

At first I wondered at the magnetic forces that supported that egg shaped bubble, until the lava poured away from the top like butter on a hot potato.
