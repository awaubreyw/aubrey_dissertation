The windshield has a sheet of plastic between 2 sheets of glass.

If you try to break through a windshield you must break the plastic so it&#39;s much harder to break through.  That is why you don&#39;t break through the windshield to enter a car.  You break any of the other windows to enter.  The windshield is part of the structural integrity of the roof and a-post of the vehicle to prevent collapse of the roof in a rollover.  A pointed hammer is best suited break tempered window glass.

So the easiest way to break the glass in a car window is with either a nail and hammer or something else sharp and strong. I personally carry a window breaker that is spring loaded and i was hoping to see one in this video, or at least the non spring loaded equivalent, at the very minimum a nail instead of the hammer head. The problem that this video doesn&#39;t consider is the edges of the window will be hidden behind parts of the car door, so you physically can not hit the edges if the window is closed. <br><br>I really like this video, but i really wish you had included pin point impact vs blunt impact on tempered glass. This is also why the glass didn&#39;t break on the drop test, the surface of the driveway is too blunt of an impact to create that pin point tension break; its not until you use the wrench to simulate a smaller impact that it breaks.

You&#39;re the man.<br><br>Though I feel compelled to note just one thing; this is the first SED that I have seen where I might know more about what is going on in the video than even Destin.  Solely because I have worked with glass for 15 years.  <br><br>A few things that might be worth mentioning: both varieties of glass that he tested (because that is what auto makes typically use) are soda-lime glass.  That means that in the manufacturing process they start with a typical silica base, and add primarily sodium carbonate, lime, typically small amounts of aluminum and a few other things, melt it, and drag the molten glass out on long conveyors. Interestingly, for annealed glass, the furnace is constantly producing glass, and the belts are usually very long, to give the glass time to cool and anneal.  They pour it continuously out of the furnace and it hardens as the pressure from pouring it all pushes the whole thing forward.  We&#39;re talking typically a quarter mile (402 meters) with some minimal friction coefficient.  Imagine the pressure pouring it gives you, to push 402 meters of glass along at an even rate.<br><br>Anyway, there are two ways of making that raw soda lime glass into tempered glass.  One is, as Destin described, a separate pour rig which forces air onto the surface of the molten plane, in order to cool the exterior to build up internal surface tension.  The other way is to take an already cut piece of annealed and put it into a cooler oven and melt the surface and innards to do the same thing, or just melt the surface and cool it immediately.  All three give the same basic result.  You can also adjust the variables to change the effect, such as using less heat and cooling a bit more slowly to heat strengthen the glass, so it is in between tempered and annealed.  It is strong because of the surface tension, but when it breaks it breaks in bigger chunks than does tempered, and is lighter.<br><br>The surface tension for tempered glass is so high that you can actually just barely tap an edge and cause it to burst.  It takes almost no pressure.  If Destin had just niked the edge instead of dropping his tempered sample, it would have easily broken.  It was actually an amazing fluke that he dropped it on the edge and corner and it did not break.  How I wish I had that luck, because i have slightly tapped tempered pieces on the edge while installing them and broken them.  <br><br>Anyway, as he noted tempered is useful in the side windows because they&#39;re strong, but if they break they wont send huge chunks of glass at your face should you get in an accident.  For the exact same reason, Federal code in the US (and almost certainly everywhere else, I just don&#39;t know any specific details about how jurisdictions outside the US work) states that glass with a high likely hood to break from normal use has to be safety glass, like in doors and near floor drains and low tot he ground. All automotive windows have to also be safteyglass.  The windshield specifically, as Destin mentioned, is actually laminated annealed glass.  Typically they&#39;re DS glass sandwiching a chunk of .080 plastic, heat fused so that they all adhere to one another.  That makes the glass much much stronger, but also makes it so that the chunks don&#39;t fly into the vab to any great degree.  Tempered glass is still stronger, but if that shattered you&#39;d have tons of tiny shards flying towards your eyes, or it would wholly obscure your vision so a rock hitting your windshield would effectively blind you, which of course is not good when moving around at high speed in a giant chunk of metal.<br><br>Lastly, there are a ton of other kinds of glass.  From high aluminum content to borosilicate  like old Pyrex (incidentally, modern kitchenware &quot;pyrxs&quot; is actually just tempered soda-lime glass) to fancy stuff like LAS (Lithium, Aluminum, Silicate) for high temp applications like oventops and fireplaces.  Some are MUCH stronger than anything you&#39;d find in a typical automobile, but they re also so expensive that the car would cost twice as much as it already does with that one little change.<br><br>That was kind of long and sort of rambling, but since Destin made a vid about something I actually know a bit about, I thought I might as well just ramble on.  If anyone bothered to read it, I hope we all learned something today.", "comment_date": "2015-11-10T04:34:46Z", "likes_count": 454}, {"comment_by": "Sarineh Shahbazi", "comment_text": "THIS IS SO COOL! :)", "comment_date": "2015-11-10T04:34:24Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "pithyginger63", "comment_text": "<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0i5rycLJ3D8&amp;t=0m19s\">0:19</a> Yes, yes I do.", "comment_date": "2015-11-10T04:32:12Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Chris Topher", "comment_text": "im so glad im ripping bongs right now", "comment_date": "2015-11-10T04:31:14Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Jorge Luis Vargas", "comment_text": "Why would you wear shorts when you&#39;re going to toss glass to the ground ?
