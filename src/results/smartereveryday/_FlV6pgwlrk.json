You just answered a perplexing question I&#39;ve had for months.  First of all, I only have vision in one eye.  It&#39;s not a  problem but occasionally it acts strange.  Each morning before daylight I have coffee on my porch.  Off in the distance, I see a red flashing light from a cell-tower.  It is sort of &#39;framed&#39; between branches of pine trees.  Unless the wind is blowing, the flash in not interrupted. I&#39;ve noticed that when I stare at the light, it blinks off then blinks back on in a different place from where I last saw it.  Sometimes the movement is small and can be in any direction from the last spot.  But lately, the movement is some distance from the original spot.  Add to that, I can actually see it move when the light is on.  And when it comes back on, it may or may not be in the same spot as the last flash.

Some call this the &quot;amygdala hijack&quot;, but it&#39;s the activation of the HPA (hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal) axis that is hijacking your rational brain (i.e., the thalamus). This emotional brain activity processes information milliseconds earlier than the rational brain, so in case of a perceived threat, the amygdala act before any possible direction from the neocortex is received. When the amygdala perceives a threat it can lead to that person to react irrationally and destructively. There&#39;s three signs to the this: strong emotional reaction, sudden onset, and post-episode realization if the reaction was inappropriate.<br><br>Now check this out.

He is the real genius. Not only is he/it a real genius, but a loving/good creator because he didn&#39;t even have to create this beautiful  world that we live in, he could have not created us or the world at all, he could of left us in total darkness &amp; non-existent. Nothing is by accident &amp; nothing is by chance &amp; so we should be thankful, that he let us come hear &amp; experience life. Even if sometimes we have to experience physical &amp; emotional pain &amp; sorrow, at least we are feeling something, &amp; like the old saying goes, life is for the most part, what you make it. Yes there are some evil people who are controlling, &amp; manipulating things, but I think the creator has something in store for them, like maybe the good people of this world will get to come back &amp; experience life many times, &amp; our soul/spirit will live on forever either in different temples/bodies &amp; one day maybe even an eternal temple that doesn&#39;t age or get tired, &amp; eventually the world will become a beautiful utopia without a monetary system, where we all work to help each other out, &amp; we share &amp; create free shelter &amp; free energy/electricity for every living human being from solar, &amp; wind power to be stored in very long lasting batteries that can withstand millions of charging cycles. Every structure will biodegradable &amp; we will grow so much organic food that nobody ever goes hungry &amp; we will always stay healthy &amp; happy, because big pharma, alcohol, drugs, &amp; assault weapons will be obsolete. Only hunting weapons that can also be used as self protection. There will no longer ever be wage slaves, to be taxed in any form so the 1% royal families, catholic/jesuit church, &amp; the deceitful high ranking Freemasons, &amp; ashkenazi jews can live off the taxation from the wage slaves &amp; through the corporation-countries they have created to keep us divided, with borderlines &amp; different languages through their system of &quot;order out of chaos&quot; wars, started by false flag attacks that the evil governments of the world create to sacrifice young men &amp; women to lucifer, the evil god the controlling 1% worship &amp; by doing so stay in control through the evil governments groups &amp; banks also gaining financially control by the fake fiat pyramid pinzi scam called currency through central banks for the wage slaves, &amp; the rebuilding of their own destruction from the wars, with their privately owned big corporations through giant government/military contracts. For the evil 1% in control I think they will pay accordingly for all the bad &amp; evil they have done, throughout the history of mankind. I honestly believe there is a great awakening going on right now, I honestly believe God the Creator of all things works through the humans he made in his likeness &amp; all the answers to our problems are right in front of our faces once we truly wake up from the dream or trance lucifer has many people in because of the monetary system &amp; material possessions we have grown to love more than life itself. We have to get rid of these evil oranizations &amp; sysrems, we all know who &amp; what they are. We have been indoctrinated to have no faith &amp; perhaps believe this is our only life &amp; we are scared of what man calls death, this is the furthest thing from the truth. We must all fight the good fight &amp; change this evil world we live in. May Peace, health, happiness &amp; love, be abundant in your lives.

It is unbelievable. This visual delay comes from how we actually see light. The photoreceptors in our eyes are chemical to electrical. Photons create a chemical response in the rods and cones in a biological chemical called rhodopsin which gets converted to the electrical impulse to the brain. But the receptor takes a finite amount of time to recover from the stimulation. It&#39;s why that first illusion you did works. The receptors have been stimulated by looking at photos of a certain wavelength consistently over a period of time, so they are overstimulated and take 10 to 30 seconds to fully recover... but during that time they are still sending the impulses to the brain so it thinks it is still &quot;seeing&quot; those colors. Overlayed on a grey image the brain filters the inverse colors into the greens and blues.<br><br>Ever looked suddenly at a clock and it seems like the second-hand pauses for a little bit longer? You&#39;re not imagining that.

He gave me a strange look, but I took him outside.  You could undeniably see the flashes of light streaking out at a very perceptible speed.  He was actually stumped by that observation.  <br>The effect is caused by the response time of your photopic and scotopic vision.  The bright light exiting the telescope registers immediately in your photopic vision, while the faint light further out takes longer, giving the clear impression that you can &quot;see&quot; the speed of light.<br>I also had a HP-35 calculator (with a red LED display).  I noticed that in dim light (where you can barely see the calculator itself) if you move it quickly in circles, the numeric display will seem to move &quot;outside&quot; of the calculator.

You can easily prove this by looking at a coloured ball - then at a while page - you&#39;ll see the opposite colour for an instant - so to answer your question -  this is not the brain but a mechanical property of the eye.

After a minute or so, you will notice that your vision tends to &quot;blank out&quot;; if you&#39;re not so good at staring at a single point, margins of objects will start showing up in a weird way. if you move, everything gets back to normal.<br><br>I think this is the remnant of some kind of ancestral functionality: whether we were predators or preys, we needed to discern animated things from inanimated. (do you remember Jurassic Park&#39;s T-Rex? &quot;... if you don&#39;t move it can&#39;t see you!!!&quot;).<br>In particular, things coming, appearing are most worth noticing...<br><br>Now, one step forward: this experiment exploits this functionality and actually makes our brains delete the negative components of a picture (as explained before), so when the picture does not change but its colours (they disappear) or brain is tricked: it noticed that PART of the signals coming from the retina that change, and it starts &quot;showing&quot; it; but what changes? I suppose that the disappearing signals from the cones that are capturing the negative colours are not as important as the new signals coming from all the other cones. In a sense, the brain focuses on signals from the cones that had been inactive till then, and gives us a positive picture of the island.<br><br>I realise that my hypothesis is not fully developed, but I think it hits the right path to follow to explain this case...", "comment_date": "2017-04-16T06:11:38Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Patty Sherwood", "comment_text": "The rods and cones in your retina make you see color after being stimulated by an opposite  color", "comment_date": "2017-04-16T02:49:47Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "MCr33py", "comment_text": "Interesting.

When you stare at the image, the cells in your eyes that see color are being used, as you keep looking at the inverted image, the cells that are being used in your eyes to see the inverted image get tired.  As a result, the cells that are not tired are the colors that the picture is made up of.  So, for example, if you looked at a bright magenta picture for 25-30 seconds, and then looked away, you would see green.  This is because the red and green cells in your eyes are used to see magenta as you can see here on this color wheel: <a href=\"https://www.d.umn.edu/~mharvey/colorwheel.jpg\">https://www.d.umn.edu/~mharvey/colorwheel.jpg</a>  The only cells left that aren&#39;t tired out are the green cells, this is why you see green.  Now, if you noticed, green is on the opposite side of the color wheel from magenta.  This means that if you stare at a bright color and then look away you will always see the inverse of it, this is why the image is inverted.  The grayscale image just helps with the image &quot;background&quot; or shading.  So all the image is doing its taking advantage of your color receptors in the back of your eye getting tired, and using that to color a picture.  It&#39;s pretty cool when you think about it.   :D", "comment_date": "2017-03-04T15:55:51Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Paulie The  R.C.

To experience this effect, you can quickly look back and forth from each side of the car. While doing that, direct your attention to the tail lights without looking directly at them.

We have a saying: &quot;Television doesn&#39;t have to work, it only has to look like it works.&quot; We use all kinds of psychovisual tricks to reduce the amount of data we need to send.  The videos you upload are compressed, like a zip file, but not really, because a zip file can be de-compressed perfectly back to the original file, but not your videos.  We call this &quot;lossy&quot; compression, and we get away with it because we know what you can&#39;t see.  <br><br>We know that you can&#39;t see detail in something that moves, so we don&#39;t send moving detail.  We know that you only have high resolution vision for black and white, not color, so the color part is sent at half resolution.  We know that you will not be able to notice flaws  in a busy part of the image (like a crowd in a stadium) compared to, say, the sky, so we don&#39;t send accurate data in the busy parts of the image.  The tricks go on and on.  <br><br>A zip file will typically reduce a file size by 2:1.  Using lossy compression we can reduce a video from 8+8+8 (24) bits per RGB pixel to about 0.17 bits/pixel (almost 150:1!).

When it inverted, I saw only gray. So, I backed it up and tried it again. I thought maybe my eyes jumped, or I unconsciously blinked, or something. I was already aware of the principle involved, and predicted mentally what you were probably going to do, so I knew it was supposed to work. However, I did not consciously know what color was supposed to be on the island.<br><br>The second time, I did see the green, but for only about a second, and then it switched to grays, while I was still staring at the lighthouse, before my eyes moved to the edge of the island. It was as if a physical switch switched it from green to gray. I have engaged in such experiments before, but it was some years ago. <br><br>So, I am wondering why my brain did not process the green longer.

I think it would be a worthy exercise, but I am not set up to do it right now, and you have some good resources there.<br><br>Actually, you might be able to run the experiment using just this video.

What else can happen is ghost image of your hand - if you holding hand in front of you, fire flashlamp, and then remove hand - pretty unusual effect. And, after you moved you eyes, image dissapear.

That seems logical, except that there is no delay; if you don&#39;t focus on the lighthouse, or if you look away at any random time, you wont see anything, where eye receptors should take a certain amount of time to switch (and in that case, we&#39;d get that effect every time an image was switched).

That is because only the cones responsible for red were over sensitized and function less, so when you continue to look at the white paper, but without the red dot all you cones (red, green and blue) are supposed operate to see white but the red ones are too tired to operate and therefore you see the negative (i.e. the opposite) of red which is the green.

Its called Neuro Synthesia. Your unconscious learned brain 1] Knows a generalisation of colour to particular natural forms, like grass, rock, water, sea, sky. And automatically fills in anomalies when they happen. Like your blind spot. 2]\u00a0Your unconscious brain knows oppositions, in many things, like colour, geometry, form. So when you replace an invert colour with black and white, you brain will automate an approximation of what a natural form of colour should be.\u00a0 This is demonstrated perfectly with\u00a0your lighthouse on the mountain. Because your inverted colour photo, was of the full colour photo, not the black an white version. But when you flicked the inverted colour to black &amp; White, Only base colours\u00a0[as explained in 1] ]\u00a0appeared\u00a0and only at 50% transparency, which is the exact same\u00a0transparency of imagery and colour\u00a0your brain produces when day dreaming, Not the full mixed spectrum. Only once you show the full colour picture, does your become immediately and consciously\u00a0aware of the colours it missed without even thinking about that anomaly, cause it does it itself.\u00a0 Your question is it the eyes doing this or your brain, is a silly question. You eyes only collect information, your Brain\u00a0processes it. Though your eyes\u00a0will only take in information the same speed your brain processes it, that is your delay. But that can counteracted. Morphine or Adrenaline can exponentially\u00a0speed up your\u00a0neurons 10 fold. The faster your neurons are activating, the more information they collect. Being frightened speeds up your neurons, and your brain can remember a lot more than it usually would.

With the opening shot of the reversed lighthouse, I get the persistence of vision thing going on there, but would add one thing you didn&#39;t mention. It has appeared to me before that when you focus on one thing for a long period of time, two things happen. First, you get the persistence of vision, as you suggested. The second thing which happens is you get a negative image built into the persistence of vision. So, if you are looking at something which is black, the persistence of vision would be white and visa-versa. Greens become reds, blues become orange, etc. This was the reason we were seeing the lighthouse picture in color when you reversed the color map (well actually, you flipped it and made it monotone) after we stared at it for a while. I really noticed this happen once when I went in a friends submarine (yes, a yellow submarine). We were under the surface of a very clear lake in Montana. As you got deeper, the color outside (shining into the sub through the windows) became more and more green. Our eyes compensated for this, but I didn&#39;t notice until we got back to the surface. Once there, EVERYTHING had a pink hue to it. It was an awesome realization. Again, I don&#39;t know if it&#39;s actually our eyes adjusting for the color, or if it&#39;s the brain which does it.

Most CG animation is done at the full 24 fps, and with the 180-degree shutter and all, but there are some examples of animation for TV done at rates as low as 6 fps, but many of these have variable framerates where the animation can ratchet up to 24 for a spell and then back down to 8 for some bits and then 16 for something else, and 6 for a slow-action scene...  basically, it&#39;s a budgeting measure wherein they reserve their time and efforts where it&#39;s crucial and cut corners elsewhere.<br><br>Of course, being able to see something as smooth is not the same thing as being able to only collect that amount of information.  The latency of that moving average doesn&#39;t mean your occipital lobe isn&#39;t still reading in more, so you can see the difference between high and low framerates.  Also, that little bit of a trough that occurs in the waiting between repetitive light emissions is why people can sometimes be sensitive to the flicker that happens in CRTs due to the phosphor fade between refresh cycles (at least until you refreshed at higher than 85 Hz or so).  This was also related in some sense to the principle behind Unipixel&#39;s (now apparently dead) TMOS display concept where they basically controlled color and/or intensity by time-limited control of a per-pixel shutter for the cycling RGB LEDs...  but you needed to refresh pretty fast to avoid rainbowing effects", "comment_date": "2015-10-06T18:16:34Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "ZeroHero", "comment_text": "60fps or go home /r/pcmasterrace", "comment_date": "2015-10-06T17:50:59Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "K9Mate", "comment_text": "Lol I Just Saw A Black And White Pic.....Thx eyes.

The cones on the retina are what detect colors. They work best when being stimulated at constantly varying levels,\u00a0which typically happens as we move are eyes around. When a particular photoreceptor gets stimulated at the same level for an extended period of time, it &quot;tires out&quot; and becomes less sensitive (its why your eyes can get tired when you stare at similar images all day like a computer screen). So, when you stare at a particular point on the backward color picture, the cones that are being stimulated start to tire out. Then, when the monochrome image replaces it, the cones don&#39;t correctly detect the even color distribution (which normally produce grey tones) that are coming in. Because each cone was tired out of the inverted color, it tends to perceive the opposite color on the monochrome image, which happens to be the\u00a0original color. You&#39;ll notice that if you avert your eyes for only a few moments after the shift, then return them, the illusion all but disappears, as you&#39;ve &quot;refreshed&quot; your cones by changing their view.This is also why you&#39;ll often perceive ghosts of bright lights that you&#39;ve seen when you close your eyes.You can try further experiments with this. If you can find a small, sharp feature to focus on in the room you&#39;re in, and force yourself to stare precisely at it, not letting your gaze shift at all, after awhile your vision will start to blur and grey out and it will become uncomfortable and the strong compulsion to shift your gaze will become hard to resist.

But what people need to realize is that the recovery time depends upon many factors such as contrast, incident light, etc. in movies they can get away with 24 f/s because each frame of the film is very similar to its neighbors. Higher contrast settings such as an alternating black and white screen require much higher frequencies, up to around 150 Hz, before our eyes see the average grey. At night, a bright LED can cause the image in our darkness-adjusted eyes to decay much more slowly which allows for this same effect to be (popularly) applied to bicycle tires, rotating at only a few revolutions per second.

That is if you look at a red light the R-cones will use-up the active protein photopsin and the R-cones will become less sensitive to red (as so with green and blue light on the G and B cones).  So if you stare at a color negative image the R, the G and the B photopsin will be reduced (photobleached) in proportion to the R, the G and B brightness and just opposite that if you where looking at the original positive.  And then when you switch to the gray image the cones that were less bleached will send (relatively) more signal to your brain and so what was an orangie sky become bluie.  But wait, the images was grey; remember that different shades of grey are made up of different intensities of equal proportions of RGB.  So the blue is there and your now relatively more sensitive B cones dominate.  I took the island image with the orangie sky to Photoshop and at approximately the center of the sky I measured a RGB value of 152, 92, 5 and in the blue (cyan) image 152, 172, 216.  So the brightest color in one image becomes the (relatively) lowest and the dimmest colors become the brightest in the other image.  Note that the R in both images is the same (152), I think this is because the inverted image (orangie sky) had its saturation and brightness bumped-up a bit (i.e. to produce a bigger impact of the cones).

We prefer 60 over 30 fps, because our eyes aren&#39;t seeing the gap as much , resulting in a smoother video. In fact our eye can&#39;t detect any more &quot;smoothness&quot; past 60 fps. In a lot of competitive video games, people prefer better frames than they do graphics.

So the monitors added up all the droplets existing in the infinitesimal slices(?) of the camera&#39;s collection of data causing the monitor to display a solid misty view.<br><br>I figured why the same length of space with slight mistiness seemed relatively clear to human sight was due to our brains doing some processing to see through or around the areas containing droplets.<br><br>Although I was curious; it was before the great internet and time prevented me from driving to a library to research the phenomenon.

Thus, when the red part of an image turns to a shade of grey, your eyes see cyan colour in its place. Blue parts are seen as yellow, and green parts as magenta.

Perhaps they continue to flow after the light is extinguished until chemical balance returns, and continues to send the &quot;signal&quot; down the nerve cell.  Also, electrically it is rare that waveforms are perfectly square, there is always at least minute amounts of capacitance and inductance in real circuits which resist change in voltage or current levels (although it is often very, very close to instantaneous, because capacitance for example is very small)...thus the LED may get to full brightness over a very small but finite time.", "comment_date": "2015-10-01T16:22:03Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "kuro shini", "comment_text": "To me the black and white thing looked like a washed out version of the actual image.

Because of the way eyes and cameras are build &lt;or grown&gt; certain part of &quot;screen &quot; (the image you see), are sending light to the specific area of your photoreceptor cells, so this means that one &quot;arcxel&quot; actually lights again and again receptors in the same area over and over again.

Then, if you overlay that part of your vision on top a black and white image, will seem to tint it slightly with the &quot;original&quot; colors. that&#39;s why you have to have a fixed point to stare into, or this doesn&#39;t work at all.<br>btw, you can increase the saturation and contrast of the inverted image you stare at to make the effect a lot stronger.<br><br>still, one of your best videos in a long time. i love actual science, as opposed to the social stuff you were into since a while ago.", "comment_date": "2015-10-01T12:45:31Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Greg Mosher", "comment_text": "Hey Destin, not sure if you have seen MonkeyLectric bike lights, they use a similar setup to make some really cool lights for bike wheels.

I always look forward to watching... <br><br>Now, it&#39;s my turn to share with you...  The following is a perfect example of persistence of vision, and trust me, you will not believe your eyes when you try this. <br><br>Take a flash bulb into a completely dark room or closet, face the bulb away from you and ignite it. You will see everything in the room for several seconds until the image fades. The brighter the flash is the better the image will look and longer it will last. Try flashing your hand in front of you. You will be amazed at the level of detail you will see in your hand.  An even more amazing thing is that you can move your head around after the initial flash and you see all the features of the room, even behind you. Just Kidding :) The image moves with your head which is a freaky feeling.<br><br>I first discovered this in 1982 (age 12) and I did it 1000s of times and loved showing my friends the effect. I used the old external camera flash from a 35mm.<br><br>BTW: that spinning LED project has been around for many years, in many flavors. There is even a cheap Chinese fan with embedded LEDs doing the same thing. About 15 years ago I bought a clock that had about 10 LEDs on a pendulum. When it was swinging, it would display the time on every sweep. You can also spin a row of LEDs vertically around a vertical axis to form a column like a can and create an image on the outer surface of the can. If you rotate an array (x,y) of LEDs around any axis through the array, you can create a &quot;REAL&quot; 3d image because at any given point in time an LED occupies every position in space within the shape that is created during rotation.", "comment_date": "2015-10-01T06:48:30Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "J K", "comment_text": "I DON&#39;T BELIEVE MY EYES!", "comment_date": "2015-10-01T06:48:01Z", "likes_count": 12}, {"comment_by": "Lwes4", "comment_text": "it didn&#39;t work", "comment_date": "2015-10-01T06:47:48Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "kieran Wynne", "comment_text": "i didnt see any coulor on the island im coulor blind dude!", "comment_date": "2015-10-01T06:44:53Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Xander Ellem", "comment_text": "I saw black and white shrugs", "comment_date": "2015-10-01T06:44:17Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "paramoreguate", "comment_text": "I thought I already understood this topic.
