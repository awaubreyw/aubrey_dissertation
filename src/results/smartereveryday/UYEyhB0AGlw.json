[{"comment_by": "SmarterEveryDay", "comment_text": "When I boarded the USS Toledo I did not know I was going to be given the opportunity to crawl down a torpedo tube.  Honestly I was thinking I would have a conversation with someone about the periscope or something but it did not occur to me that when you are under the ice you cannot use the periscope.  When they asked me if I wanted to see a torpedo tube I didn\u2019t realized I had no clue how they worked. Most people overlook this seemingly simple system, but when you take a moment and analyze it you will realize it is quite complicated. I hope this is the level of detail you were hoping for in the submarine series, because this is what gets me excited. I haven\u2019t decided which video is next but I\u2019ll tell you this, I did not know one of the methods they use on board to make oxygen. Anyways, thank you for watching the series and please consider subscribing if you feel like this is worthy of your time. I don\u2019t know if you\u2019re the type of person that likes to share videos with other people, but I would appreciate it if you could pass the submarine series on to a friend or two. As always, I would like to express my gratitude to people who support Smarter every day on Patreon at <a href=\"http://www.patreon.com/SmarterEveryDay\">http://www.patreon.com/SmarterEveryDay</a> .

Once the torpedo leaves the tube and assuming it\u2019s neutrally buoyant, the mass of water that it displaced must be equal to the torpedo\u2019s mass. So, when the impulse tank empties water to launch the torpedo, the mass of the water that was used to launch the torpedo must be equal to that of the torpedo. This would mean that the submarine bears the weight of an extra torpedo as water in the impulse tank, and if this tank empties then it must also simultaneously be refilled in order to maintain neutral buoyancy.<br><br>So my question is, does the impulse tank have a constant flow of water INTO itself as it pumps water OUT of the tank to the torpedo tube? Because, if the mass inside the impulse tank is sealed from external seawater this means that the submarine experiences a net loss of mass as the torpedo is fired out. The submarine loses the mass of the torpedo, and the amount of water inside of the impulse tank stays constant, resulting in an imbalance. The only way I can think of to correct this imbalance is to fill up the impulse tank with the mass of the torpedo that was fired out.", "comment_date": "2021-01-19T15:38:26Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Jermone Pemberton", "comment_text": "Every day you learn something new", "comment_date": "2021-01-19T05:56:47Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "charles manning", "comment_text": "Awesome \ud83d\ude0e", "comment_date": "2021-01-18T22:07:52Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "rinleez", "comment_text": "&quot;Can I step on the nose of the  torpedo?&quot; I lost it.", "comment_date": "2021-01-18T00:17:32Z", "likes_count": 48}, {"comment_by": "MrGilRoland", "comment_text": "<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UYEyhB0AGlw&amp;t=12m53s\">12:53</a> That valve sure knows how to enjoy life.", "comment_date": "2021-01-17T21:51:45Z", "likes_count": 3}, {"comment_by": "Stuart Fury", "comment_text": "imagine being special forces and having to use the tubes to enter/leave the sub.

Hanrahan, of Indian Wells, passed away on February 27, 2019. He graduated Manhattan College in Riverdale, N.Y.,  with a bachelors in electrical engineering in 1959. Upon graduation he worked for Hazeltine Corporation. At Hazeltine Don designed many projects for NASA, including the design of the electronics control system for the &quot; moon buggy&quot;, the Lunar Rover used on Apollo 15. He was responsible for the electronic design of the display system for the FAA air traffic control system, the Mariner C Solar Plasma detector on its journey to Mars, the Identification system for the SAM - D Missile system. Don did research in high-speed digital logic, as well as many other interesting projects.  In 1975 Don went to work for Ford Aerospace in Newport Beach, where he designed missile electronics on many programs, for the Air Force, Navy and US Army including the design of support equipment for these systems. Retirement was in 1992.   Don and Jean traveled wide and often, visiting all of the continents (except Antarctica (too cold) and more than 120 countries.<br><br>Unfortunately the high IQ did not extend to my DNA.

As a byproduct of the engine operation, water as H2O can be separated into Hydrogen (which is expelled<br>or pressurized in Hydrogen tanks) and oxygen which is put back into the air filtration system.

The reason being is that the pressure vessel of the submarine is the only volume experiencing a buoyancy force (i.e. the seawater is displaced by only the pressure vessel and some of the external structures).  The pressure vessel is roughly a fixed size, so anything that is within the vessel has no impact on the buoyant forces.  To not sink, the submarine actively manages the weight of the boat via ballast systems, so as long as the submarine can expel enough weight, anything that fits in the vessel can be brought on board and the boat is neutral.  Once a weight leaves the boat, it must also be accounted for as the ship is now lighter than that weight, so sea water must be brought on board.  If the object in question was neutrally buoyant, the same volume of water as the object is brought on board.", "comment_date": "2020-09-05T19:47:28Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Dirk Boersma", "comment_text": "Buoyancy ballet.

The only way to stop that would be to swim the thing level and that costs you distance and speed.<br><br>B: Submarines don&#39;t have a problem with running out of air - they make their own with electrolysis. The reason they keep the compressed air on board is because dumping air makes a lot of noise. So does shooting a torpedo, of course, but air takes a lot longer to get to the surface and is very noisy the whole time you&#39;re doing it, and it&#39;s not like they&#39;re not trying very hard to reduce all noise everywhere.<br><br>C: Water doesn&#39;t compress, the reason for the equalising vent isn&#39;t to set the same pressure inside and outside the tube - they are the same as soon as it&#39;s full, it&#39;s to match salinity and temperature so the torpedo can understand its target data once it&#39;s off the wire.<br><br>D: You didn&#39;t mention the wire?!

I would encourage each additional video installment to bring more of this to the front, create that immersion that your viewers can come away feeling they were there, virtually of course, and yet feel the content wasn&#39;t just another &quot;sub tour&quot;, but an actual &quot;sub sandwich&quot;, full of humanity, personality, and content. <br><br>My grandfather retired Navy as LCDR, buried in Hawaii, and raised me in the Islands. One of my most favorite activities was him taking me out to the base and spending time in the sub museum, a mock setup of a section of a sub, complete with a periscope.

There are going to be famines and tons of extreme destructive weather and sickness. The world is going to follow the New World Order in which everyone is united under one government and it will be an evil one.

Have a mating collar at the reloading facility of their choice, that collar clamps and seals unto the face and the armament is back fed into the system where existing mechanisms reverse load it into the magazine.<br><br><br>That would cut all the time it takes to load these things in half. No fiddling, not &quot;pay attention&quot; just automated, existing mechanisms that already function at peak efficiency for that purpose, asked to reverse the operation, so not even an issue of complication on their part. IE, no human error guard to slow the process down.<br><br><br>Not only that, but the whole problem of &quot;decisions made XX years ago, affect what can be loaded today&quot; would be rendered moot, since all it would take is a redesign of the tube and mechanisms and the payload would change according to needs. There&#39;s certainly plenty of space, and i&#39;m 100% sure the engineers left enough &quot;grounds&quot; exactly for that kind of stuff. I refuse to believe the engineers of that era, would do things any other way in that regard considering the myriad of other examples of forward thinking in boat/tank/plane design.<br><br><br>Bear in mind, my wonder is solely a question, i&#39;m sure there&#39;s a ton of issues that can be raised, but i just see an efficiency issue. Why load the weapon through a lot of hassle, dismantle sections of the ship, willingly expose it to enemy attacks et cetera, when all this could be done, NOT only out of sight and out of mind (the collar clamp feeding tube would not need any kind of human intervention, pure automation) but it could also be done out in the waters. You&#39;d have a specialized ship class just for that purpose alone, feed the sub.<br><br><br>We have them for airplanes, IMO, a far, far, more complicated affair, why not for subs, where things can be much more simpler to do, because of the nature of the water&#39;s relative safety. And none of the things/technologies i implied are alien to us. Again, we&#39;ve done all of those things, not only in air, BUT also in space, which share a lot with sub design, afaik, in the area of seals, structure, construction.<br><br><br>If it were up to me, i would design a sub to have the ability of stealth loading.

I was unable to convince ANYONE at the time that he didn&#39;t have to guess at all. Whales are more or less neutrally buoyant, and especially if you could communicate with them (which Spock had been doing) you could ask them to take just a deep enough breath to become exactly neutrally buoyant. At which point you measure the length, depth and height of the tank, take a sample of the seawater to compute density and voila, you have the EXACT weight of the whales and seawater.<br><br>...and completely eradicate a heartwarming exchange between Spock and McCoy, of course. :)<br><br>And the above is the exact same reason you can trade the torpedo for seawater and don&#39;t have to worry about changing your center of buoyancy/center of gravity whatsoever.<br><br>Sorry about the detour into SciFi.", "comment_date": "2020-08-17T16:48:46Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "noah huggins", "comment_text": "Destin, your videos are some of the absolute highest quality and importance on YouTube.

And after the 2nd. World War Vladimir Vladimirovich Putin was born in the 20th century he was a child or poor infant and as an adult he is a social resentful since until the year 2036 he is the dictator of Russia and antichrist (Criminal-Mentally Ill) of the 21st century and is the most billionaire man of this world, with the power of destruction of the nuclear button and creating anarchy, chaos, pandemics, violence or currently protests of racism among others. I am not a religious fanatic; But to prevent him from submitting to humanity, we must apply the corrective of ending once and for all with the secrecy of all anonymous bank accounts or without personal data of their owners that they do have active in the banks of SWITZERLAND, Island Cayman, VATICAN bank that can be immediately verified by any world security or police agency, call INTERPOL, DEA, SCOTLAND YARD, HaMishtara HaTzvait- ISRAEL among others, since they are breeding grounds for demon allies or helpers of the antichrist of the century 21 and these helper demons are: \u201cterrorist FARC, ELN, ISIS, jihadists, murderous dictator of Nicaragua, communist-Argentine POPE of the Catholic Church Francisco, WHO director Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, Chinese empire, Turkish empire, Iran empire, Cuba, dictator of North Korea, of the narco-terrorist dictator of VENEZUELA failed \u201d. In the specific case of the narco-terrorist demon dictator of VENEZUELA Nicolas Maduro Moros who has ill-gotten 5,000,000,000 dollars deposited in the Vatican bank not including the ill-gotten billions of dollars that they constantly deposit in his anonymous Swiss bank accounts and through millionaire economic resources that it exploits and extracts from Venezuela such as: &quot;Gold, diamonds, thorium, coltan, oil, uranium, aluminum, iron, etc&quot; a small part is sold to the previously named helper demons of the 21st century antichrist but really Most of those riches are sold primarily NOT to Russia but directly to the current 21st century antichrist and owner of the Russian state oil company Rosneft. And the antichrist of the 21st century and all his &quot;helper demons including Nicolas Maduro Moros- Venezuela&quot; have these anonymous bank accounts active and use them to harm or subdue the inhabitants of a specific country or in a general way to harm or submit to the humanity. In the world there were two (2) great events and there will be a third event, and these are: The 1st. Event: It was the birth of the human being called a caveman or caveman. The 2nd. Event: It was the disclosure as a state secret of the INTERNET since it is currently NOT only for military use but for the public domain, since the technical or scientific information between the sky, the earth and the bottom of the ocean with the INTERNET is nothing hidden . And the 3rd. Event is the disclosure to humanity that will be announced no later than or MAXIMUM in the year 2035 that we are not alone in this world and we are not the only intelligent beings in the universe; since there are aliens that live with us. Since the missing link of our ancestors between the clumsy and slow cavemen and the current hybrid or modern human being are the aliens. There will always be only wars: &quot;conventional as all those that occurred after August 6, 1945, also trade wars (such as the current USA-CHINA; among others)&quot;, there will also be unjust pandemics such as the current COVID-19 and other pandemics or viruses that will later come to this in order either to unjustly purify humanity of children and sick people and of the elderly or elderly population that are not productive and that represents a huge social expense of retirement or cure payments especially for the government of Russia since there is more old or elderly population living there than young population and also due to mishandling of batteries as the capitalist communist republic of CHINA did. Now, the current human being is a hybrid since aliens modified their DNA just 10,000 years ago. Hence, my theory comes that the current nuclear age that began on August 6, 1945 was the AWAKENING of the hybrid or modern human being, and since that date there have been more than 15 attempts at self-destruction wanting to unleash the 3rd. War or nuclear hecatomb but the aliens prevented it since the only and total losers would be: &quot;The whole of humanity, animal and plant life, and the aliens that live with us&quot; and that is why we must end several myths that seem Childish or stupid to think or continue to believe in them, and these are: 1) That the human being was created in the image and likeness of God since our DNA for about 10,000 years was modified by aliens, 2) That the dinosaurs They were extinguished by a huge meteorite or asteroid that hit the earth and the oil came or is the product of that extinction. What DOES really happen is that the aliens were modifying the DNA millions of years ago to each animal of each species of dinosaurs so that they could evolve with the human being in the current ecosystem. And scientifically or technically oil exists before the dinosaurs or since the planet earth was formed since at the level of the earth&#39;s surface it is called Oil in Rock or Crack and buried at high depths the oil is liquid or molten since the rock Oil crack due to the high temperature and pressure under the earth or at the bottom of the sea this becomes liquid or molten also as is the case of iron at the level of the earth&#39;s surface or in mountains and far from the core of the earth is in solid form iron, on the other hand, in the center of the iron-nickel earth is super liquid or molten and not solid due to the high temperatures and pressure that exist there creating the famous magnetic field that protects us from the gamma radiation and neutrons that come of space especially the sun. If we continue to believe that oil is the product of the extinction of the dinosaurs, then I ask, is it that all dinosaurs lived in Venezuela, Saudi Arabia and some OPEC countries, and the most exquisite or purebred dinosaurs lived perhaps only in the North Sea since the oil there is purer than the rest of the members of OPEC and VENEZUELA ? In our universe there are asteroids that contain iron, gold, diamonds, coltan, thorium, uranium, lead, bacteria; also petroleum in the form of rock or crack bound with other minerals such as calcium, lead, etc. Currently the largest oil reserves in rock or crack are held by the USA, whose technology to melt or exploit it was transferred or rented to the Republic of China since they have huge amounts of crack or oil in rock and this oil reserves in rock or crack of the USA surpass the liquid oil reserves that VENEZUELA and OPEC countries have. 3) That there is fresh water on the earth&#39;s surface and in no other part of this world and universe. Since there are huge reservoirs of fresh water below the earth&#39;s surface, as in several comets, planets and asteroids they are sources of frozen fresh water supply. 4) That man did not go, did not step on, or did not reach the moon, since on 07/15/1969 he did arrive and colonize the moon and at the end of the 1970s he arrived and colonized the planet Mars and currently dominates the anti gravity technology see plane TR-3 Black blanket. 5) By mistake of the impact of a missile, it exploded on 03/08/2014 to MALAYSIA Airlines flight 370 MH370 / MAS370. Since all its passengers were pure international scientists who were going to give a conference and news about the vaccine and cure of some cancer and AIDS &quot;as I affirm or confess on 06/16/2020 Donald John Trump President of the USA&quot; and also They were going to warn of the possible pandemic such as the covid-19. 6) That it was by chance that the asteroid that exploded in the airspace of Tunguska-Siberia-RUSSIA on 06/30/1908; What if it really happened is that the 10,000-year-old black knight extraterrestrial artifact that orbits between the earth and the international space station &quot;ISS&quot; fired a beam of energy to prevent further damage to planet earth, I don&#39;t know if you have noticed that no satellite, old space stations: &quot;Skylab-USA, MIR-RUSA&quot;, shuttle or private space rockets or missile approaches or orbit close to it. There is a trace recently discovered that in our ancestor with more than 5,000 years old before the Christian era in our world there were detonations of nuclear weapons products of advanced technologies of wars between extraterrestrials. Everything that happens in this world is for a cause-effect either for &quot;Human evolution, slavery, self-destruction&quot; and NOT by mere chance. And all the uncertainties, myths or legends: Who and why John Fitzgerald Kennedy was assassinated; how long did Adolf Hitler live and where did he die, The universe is limited in time and size, including those related to the Blessed Jesus of Nazareth from the time he was conceived in the womb of the Blessed Virgin Mary of Nazareth until his resuscitation will be answered or revealed with more precision by the extraterrestrials by being witnesses or direct participants from millions of years ago from the evolutionary facts of planet earth. It seems primitive or childish to me that in the middle of the 21st century in my beloved and beautiful Jerusalem-Israel, its pilgrims go to the wailing wall to insert or send written pieces of paper or hit their heads against the wall or speak to the wall and believing that God or the wall : &quot;He will answer: either in writing on the same or another paper, or spoken or by telepathy&quot;.

If you simply trust in His finished work on the cross for your sins, you will be saved.

First of all, I worked on both the Los Angeles class fast attack submarines and the Ohio class ballistic missile subs. Secondly, my father, who passed in 2009, was a Naval Academy graduate, class of 1954, and a nuclear submariner for most of his 26 year Naval career. He was a navigator, weapons officer, executive officer and commanded both a fast attack and a missile boat. He eventually became a division commander, with 7 submarines in his division and finally, a squadron commander, with 21 subs under his command. He was a great guy and is missed by many of his friends and family. His experience was at the zenith of the Cold War and he had some very interesting stories, many which he could not go into too much detail. Thanks again, you have an outstanding channel, two of my sons are huge fans as well.", "comment_date": "2020-08-16T22:50:33Z", "likes_count": 3}, {"comment_by": "Ryely Rachor", "comment_text": "The intro drawing gave me Mythbusters vibes, and im all for that every new episode.", "comment_date": "2020-08-16T22:49:21Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "WeRemodel.com, llc", "comment_text": "Awesome video.
