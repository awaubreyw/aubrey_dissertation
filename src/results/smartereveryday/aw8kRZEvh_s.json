Then, they should train with a semi-automated system where instead of the whole thing being automatic, they press buttons, with each button having its own smaller algorithm which controls smaller movements as opposed to the entire landing (like turning, going forward, etc). Lastly, they should train for landing it manually should something go wrong with the algorithms.

The car stops at red lights and stop signs but requires driver approval to resume travel. At traffic signals it always requires approval even if the light is green.

Their Full Self Driving software is, at this time, released as a beta version to only drivers that prove through their actual driving that they can be trusted with more computer control of the driving.

If an automated vehicle fails, it can kill the passengers, it can kill other unrelated people, and it can cause severe money loses, that&#39;s why you want someone who can take the wheel at all times, you just can&#39;t risk failures here. Think on modern airplanes for the last example. Airplanes are highly automated but pilots can still do a lot of the work by themselves if it&#39;s needed.

Now we&#39;ve got enough processing power to set Perseverance down on Mars via marionette strings and &quot;no break&#39;um egg.&quot;<br>But...if you have a CH9 or CH10 challenge (and as was rightly pointed out, the miracle wasn&#39;t that Armstrong put the LEM down without cracking it, but that 6 LEM pilots managed it 6 times, perfectly) then why would you have any software stability moderator at all.<br>Maybe I&#39;m talking out of my hat, but as a performance driver, I&#39;m doing something simple compared to piloting, even when I&#39;m in the teeth of it. My experience with the SAE J3016_201609 0-5 levels of automation in self-driving cars, is that we either need to be at zero (no system correction for driver error) or five (no driver required.) Automated stability systems trip up a competent pilot the same way they trip up a competent pilot. Yes, as I said, I&#39;m dealing with fewer axis. But when I want to hang the rear end out going around a right corner and take the shear force on the treads, automation steps in (Vehicle Stability Control) and gently applies braking to the rear wheels and front left wheel to take my precisely considered oversteer and adjust the inertial moment so it lines up with the longitude of the car. What might have been a very needful act on my part while on the track means that I just sideswiped another driver at speed because my &quot;system&quot; thinks it knows better.<br>So either all on, or all off.

So if the proper tests are done, I think an AI will always outperform a human just because we design them to do so. Does that mean a human doesn&#39;t need to know how to pilot the spaceship?

I don&#39;t think the humans should be &quot;taking control&quot; of the lander if the algrothim doesn&#39;t perform, I feel it should be the other way around. Humans should be landing it, with the computer essenitally backing them up should anything go too far. Computer reaction times are far faster than a humans, and with the right software probably more precice. Mostly here I&#39;m thinking of how ABS brakes in cars are developed and used. The driver still drives the car, and can use the breaks to stop, but the ABS manages the breaks for a more effective and controlled stop. If we apply this style of system to the lander then surely the humans can pilot it down, and should anything unsual happen the landing system takes over and re-centers and balances the vehicle. And like the breaks, if the human wants to stop breaking they take the foot off the breaks, if the pilot wants to stop the landing, the hit a thrust acrion and makes another attempt.<br>This means yes, we need to make a polited test vehicle, and all the learning that comes from not only designing, but interfacing and practing the use of the lander, but also how the human element affects things, like a human reaches for a lever, this very slightly moves the center of balance of the vehicle. Most pilots default account for that, and computers would need to learn how to account for that too.

There was a trade done on whether to add a gimbal to the EGC.  In addition to adding mass and complexity, it would have been very challenging to keep a gimballed EGC pointing through the center of mass of the system.  A fixed EGC allowed much better alignment of the EGC with the center of mass of the system.  If the thrust didn&#39;t go through this point, it would produce a torque around the vehicle.  Since the EGC had several pounds of thrust which was much more than the small attitude thrusters, the vehicle could only handle a few centimeters of misalignment.  Designing a gimballed EGC to do this would have required not just tilting the EGC to stay vertical but also moving the location of the thrust.  This would have been a fun mechanical design but it would have been quite challenging to get right.<br><br>With a fixed EGC, this complexity went away.  Since we didn&#39;t pitch over very far, the EGC still cancelled the difference in earth and lunar gravity very well.  (cosine 10 deg is close to 1 for the engineers out there).  The main impact of the fixed EGC was that when the vehicle pitched over, the EGC thrust also pushed us laterally (sine of 10 deg is not close to 1!).  This effect was not small but we accounted for it when designing the control system.  Since the vehicle used the thrust to move sideways by pitching over, we only had to pitch 1/6 of what we would have to do on the moon.  <br><br>Like many engineering systems, this was a compromise.  The simulations of the mighty eagle modeled the fixed EGC and gave us confidence in our entire system.

We need the ability to fly and land cargo - for every kilogram of human we send to the Moon, we&#39;ll be sending hundreds of kilograms of &quot;stuff&quot; that humans need there - food, water, air, a habitat, a power source, vehicles, space suits...you name it.   Since humans are fallible, we don&#39;t want to risk a human pilot in every one of those flights.  So cargo flight has to be autonomous.   Once you have very reliable autonomous cargo landing - that you&#39;ve done dozens of times without a problem - then landing a human using the exact same system is the smart thing to do.   It&#39;s also cheaper - training astronauts to fly manually is a costly business - we can avoid the need for that.    Automation is also allowing more people to go there.   Suppose you want to send a TV documentary crew to the Moon - you don&#39;t want to have to train them to fly a lander.  You want them to push one big red button that says &quot;GO TO THE MOON&quot; and have it &quot;just work&quot;.   Sure, it&#39;s not very &quot;Buck Rogers&quot; to do that - but it&#39;s the rational way to go now we&#39;re here in the 21st century.   We have self-driving cars, we have self-flying drones, we have rockets that can send something into orbit then return to Earth and nail a landing onto a barge out at sea.   For an autonomous machine, the moon is EASIER - with less gravity, everything happens more slowly.   With no need to cope with wind or clouds or fog or rain or snow.    Landing on the Moon is a precisely repeatable environment.   For a human, it&#39;s harder because our sense of distance - of orientation, etc - is fighting our earth-evolved bodies.  The Apollo astronauts continually had problems with judging distance because the horizon is closer, the lack of atmospheric attenuation of the light made it hard to judge distances too.  The lack of erosion on the surface made everything sharp and hard edged which doesn&#39;t look like Earth terrain.   The fractal nature of cratering leaves you without size cues.   We know roughly how big a tree is - we know how big a house or a car is.   We use these cues all the time...but on the Moon, it&#39;s not like that.

Autopilot systems have been in development for almost a century at this point (starting in WWII), but we still use pilots.<br>So when asked if a pilot should have final authority over controls on a lunar lander, or if it should lie with a system we can only test in a simulated environment, I say that the pilot should always have the final say.

The EGC vector angles with the vehicle and so it is indistinguishable from any other landing thruster.  When Mighty Eagle pitched, it had the full sine component of the EGC thruster also adding to it&#39;s translation.  The only time the EGC thruster was actually exactly canceling Earth&#39;s gravity would have been when the vehicle was not accelerating horizontally, and that&#39;s basically the only time an EGC thruster is needed from a simulation standpoint.

If we&#39;re looking for redundancy when piloting a lander, it comes down to how many disparate approaches we can apply. I&#39;m assuming they&#39;ve currently got hardcoded algorithms with some adjustable parameters. That&#39;s one option, and the human is another, but I think we should have at least one more in the form of an AI.<br><br>What we&#39;re seeing is that machine learning is an incredible tool for interpreting a complex set of data and deriving the correct result. Unlike the human, the AI doesn&#39;t bring any Earth-gravity preconceptions, and it doesn&#39;t need to be painstakingly written. Instead, it just tries all the different approaches to evolve towards the solutions. Take it a step further and develop a GAN where it tries to land safely while an opposing AI tries to develop a landscape that is impossible to land on. Then both AI will become incredibly robust in a short amount of time. The opposing AI could also be helpful for human pilots&#39; training.<br><br>I think that would be the perfect plan B if/when the wrote algorithms fail, or if the pilot is unable to perform. It also means we have a highly adaptive tool that is generalized to conditions we wouldn&#39;t expect on just the moon. It could apply to many different missions. I can imagine if we&#39;re trying to eventually get lots of people to space, needing lots of highly trained pilots is going to become a limiting factor.", "comment_date": "2021-03-08T01:00:38Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "RandomTorok", "comment_text": "As a computer scientist I know how often computers glitch.

And even if it does, wouldn&#39;t it no longer be pushing straight through the lander&#39;s center of gravity?  It seems to me like cancelling out earth gravity is only possible if you&#39;re able to freely move the thrust vector&#39;s theta and phi coordinates to always be pointing away from the vehicles center of mass and towards the Earth&#39;s center of mass, which itself seems impossible, but if you were to limit the allowed roll/pitch of during flight to a certain range I suppose it could maybe be possible.  Perhaps with a combination of thrusters gimballing would be sufficient because you could cancel out any roll/pitch created by the gimball no longer pointing through the lander&#39;s center of mass, but in that case you&#39;d need effectively two whole separate thruster systems - one for earth gravity cancellation and one for the lander simulation.  Is that what is actually the case with the lander here?", "comment_date": "2021-03-07T22:08:33Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Nondescript", "comment_text": "Uh, modern-day Logan looks fine, but 8-years-ago Logan looks <i>f i n e</i> =)", "comment_date": "2021-03-07T22:07:52Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Robert Klauco", "comment_text": "I don&#39;t think you are right with the human landing.

This would be great to make sure the practice on Earth would &quot;feel&quot; the same as the actual moon environment.  (there is no way to perfectly simulate that environment on Earth even with a EGT or equivalent).  It could also impose soft limits (like bank and pitch limits) just like the Airbus uses.  3.  A fully manual mode in case of a compete failure of the flight control computers.  This would be a &#39;last option&#39;, but an important one if those astronauts have a VERY bad day.

They can only work in the atmosphere of our plane Earth. <br><br>Correctly stated, Newton&#39;s third law is: For every action their is an equal and opposite reaction. In other words, every force involves the interaction of two separate objects. When one object exerts a force on a second object, the second object also exerts a force on the first object. The two forces are equal in strength and oriented in opposite directions. Therefore, a single mass object cannot move itself. It must have a separate force to interact with. <br><br>This being the case, there can be no disputing that nothing on Earth, whether it be biological or mechanical, can defy the physical laws of Earth. These laws assert that every living thing and every man made vehicle on our plane of existence must have the inherent ability to push away from a separate resistant force in order to be able to travel in a given direction. So without separate resistant forces, (force pairs), there can be no thrust and thus no movement. <br><br>And, that also applies to rockets, which are single mass objects.<br><br>Consider these facts: There are two forces required for a rocket to fly in Earth&#39;s atmosphere. Thrust and downward force. <br><br>The thrust: comes from the burning of fuel at the bottom end of the rocket where hot gas molecules are forced from the combustion chamber down through the jet nozzles in an unbroken pressurized stream. <br><br>The downward force: comes from the ambient external mass of air pressure that completely and constantly presses against the exterior of the rocket and also infiltrates and floods the interior space of the jet nozzles. And it is the friction from this external mass of air pressure that affords the rockets thrust the resistance with which to push away from. <br><br>So the force pair is the thrust column and the pressure of air. The thrust constantly pushes away from the resistance of air pressure and the air pressure constantly pushes against the thrust with equal force. <br><br>Without this positive air pressure providing a constant resistant force for the thrust to push away from, a rocket could not fly. In fact, without air pressure, nothing on Earth could fly. <br><br>In &#39;space&#39; there is no atmospheric pressure which naturally means there is zero pressure on the rocket and therefore absolutely zero resistance. <br><br>The vacuum of what we are told &#39;space&#39; is, is the complete opposite to the atmosphere of Earth. The heavens as we currently understand them, are completely void. Therefore, as soon as the nozzle is opened to release the gases, the combustion chamber becomes part of the infinite vacuum of &#39;space&#39;. <br><br>This means that when the rocket jets are open, there is no barrier or resistance to prevent the high pressure gases inside the chamber from flowing out into the low pressure vacuum of &#39;space&#39;. It would be like taking a bottle of air into space. The air inside the bottle would be pressurized and so, when you remove the cap, the high pressure air would naturally flow out into the region of low pressure, (vacuum), to meet equilibrium and disappear into the farthest reaches of &#39;space&#39;. <br><br>Consequently, with no resistant force to stop them, the gases expelled from the open combustion chamber through the jets would immediately disperse into the endless expanse of &#39;outer space&#39;, traveling at a constant speed, never slowing down or colliding with any outside elements, or indeed with each other, the gases would forever move away from the combustion chamber. They would thus be incapable of returning a positive force to the rocket to propel it in any direction.<br><br>So, essentially, without the required resistance of positive air pressure to push away from, a rocket could expel its hot gas molecules into &#39;space&#39; for eternity and not move an inch...<br><br>Finally after almost 60 years of alleged space travel, no one on this plane of existence has ever seen a rocket enter &#39;space&#39; or return from &#39;space&#39;. No one has seen a rockets thrust working in space or moving a rocket in space, (except for: Hollywood movies, TV series, video games etc.) Every launch is sent up at a non vertical trajectory and arches over the ocean to disappear out of sight where it then crashes into the ocean meeting its predestined conclusion. <br><br>There should be an inordinate amount of proof for what was discussed and so it should be incredibly easy to prove. But of course, it isn&#39;t easy at all because there is nothing to base these government agencies claims on. Which is why, after almost six decades, believers of the official mainstream narrative are still desperately trying to prove to a rapidly increasing number of doubters that rockets work in space by constantly quoting Newtons 1st, 2nd, and 3rd laws, conservation of momentum, using model rockets in small vacuum chambers or by presenting the usual hypothetical scenarios of guns/bullets, skateboard/bowling ball, etcetera. But these mainstream science pushers can never ever provide independent, fully detailed, verifiable, irrefutable and observable scientific evidence that clearly and unquestionably prove that rockets work in space.

Because, ROCKETS CANNOT WORK IN &#39;SPACE&#39;.", "comment_date": "2021-03-07T17:56:55Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "UnknownGuy Guy", "comment_text": "I see him, Destin, I like!", "comment_date": "2021-03-07T17:56:48Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Clementine", "comment_text": "Wait a minute!
