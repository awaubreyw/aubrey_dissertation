Wow. <br>My back yard is like a golf course with ups and downs. I am constantly lowering and raising the deck as I mow. It&#39;s so difficult to mow. The front yard on one side has bermuda grass I think and the other side has zoysia grass. I have no idea who planted this but the zoysia is nothing but a pain to mow. <br><br>Also, using a weed eater is a pain too because the string keeps breaking.

This was a rural area and I am from the suburbs, I didn&#39;t know what a flail was until I looked under the mower.  However, I am still confused as to how it could get sharper as it cuts.

ALSO, the amount of energy on the fine edge can not be dispersed quick enough through more of the grass blade. hence why a sharper blade cuts grass easier as opposed to a duller one. a dull blades impact point is broader thus dispersing the energy in a larger area area.<br><br><br>so key to actually cutting grass is sharpest edge, and highest speed.  the whole &quot;suction&quot; or &quot;vacuum&quot; thing has so little of effect that its more of a old wives tail. but I guess thats what you get for asking your barber about physics.", "comment_date": "2019-12-31T12:26:19Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Jose canyousee", "comment_text": "Ok now you gotta do a mulch mower.", "comment_date": "2019-12-31T05:10:21Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Peatographee", "comment_text": "Do You Think You Can Make A Video About How People Are Able To PickPocket Without Them Feeling it?", "comment_date": "2019-12-30T22:26:06Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Adam Gosselin", "comment_text": "You should weigh a running and non running mower and see if there\u2019s any difference due to suckage.", "comment_date": "2019-12-30T21:13:25Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Zander Burger", "comment_text": "I know it&#39;s more yard tools but when cutting a branch with a saw.

With a sharp blade (unlike the one in the video) this creates a small stress point that overcomes the tensile strength of the grass, and severs it. with a dull blade, that stress point is much larger and is spread over a longer length of grass. Similar to ep. 194 with the bullet through the playing card; the card didn&#39;t need any suction to prevent it from being pushed over.

I had to clean the deck 1/2 through mowing my 4 1/2 acres,because it would clog up and start throwing softball side clods out. After much research and (absolutely NO help from Hustler) I figured out the theory/concept of a mower deckand blades. The blades work in conjunction with the deck to do 2 things  1: to create lift and 2: to move it OUT. Both things have to happen or you get a nice cut ( suction) for a short time because the cut grass just gets packed to the deck, this does 2things. 1: the grass is now packing up on top of all the cut grass 2: completely redesigning the shape of the deck which destroys the airflow. After 2 years of relentless effort,I finally found someone at Hustler that confessed that the XR-7 deck is a bad design and for $1000.00 + 300.00 shipping I could buy a new style deck. It is funny how my 1994 Toro 52&quot; walk behind with a velkie that had a STAMPED deck mowed the very same grass for 8 years ( only sold it due to knee problems) and I only cleaned the deck when I put the mulching kit on. It just made it easier to bolt up /ad I only got a few hand fuls. Now if I don&#39;t mow in the Very hottest part of the it will actually stall the 27 hp engine about 3/4 through.the 1300.00 may have been worth it but if they didn&#39;t do the XR 7 right I didn&#39;t trust them to do it right on this new one and it cost me more.if you think it through a stamped deck with a rounded top should flow air mor efficiently than a sharp top welded at 90 deg. I&#39;m no rocket scientist but proof is in the pudding ( or mowing) . Just something to think about when you plunk down your hard earned $$. If they will not let you demo the unit you want /look for another dealer.

At the time I was working on a JD deck that had these radical L shape mower blades just under 80 degrees  I remember asking him why they would design them like that. He referred me to someone else that could explain it better but explained why they built them like that. He showed me deck design drawings that showed how they work.  On riding mowers the bags are mounted on the back . The grass side discharged  but threw a tunnel upwards to the bags. The best way of getting the grass to travel all the way into the bag was the high lift blades .  Any way just search best blades for bagging lawn mowers. or the difference between mulching blades and bagging blades . 2 way blades/3 way blades. or just go to sites that sell blades&quot; Sears &quot;  They show the difference. Bagging high lift. Also the blades pull the air from under the deck .The high lift blades are like a fan blowing out the discharge. This is also the reason there are kits that can be added to a deck for mulching .(Using less curved blades) . They limit the amount of air flow keeping most of the cut grass in the deck cutting it more than once as it circulates out the bottom. Sorry about the rant .Hope this helps you.", "comment_date": "2019-05-10T03:28:36Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Landon", "comment_text": "Wow i never would have guessed thats how it worked!

The first rotary mowers also had no turn-up on the blades as the blades were exposed beneath the mower and did not need to discharge the grass. The turn-ups were only introduced when it became necessary to discharge the grass into a collector (grass catcher or bag) or discharge it out of the side of the mower when the blades became enclosed (for safety reasons). I still have a blade disc from one of these early mowers and the blades are completely flat.

A lawn mower blade has a air lift on the back of it also called a trailing edge or tip, that trailing edge does alot of things, it creates an upward air draft or a vacuum, suction to lift or stand the grass up so that it gets cut evenly and it also creates that upward air draft (vacuum or suction) to lift and eject the cut clippings and debris out the side of the deck if side discharging or up into a rear bagger unit if bagging. Now there are many different types of mower blades, the blades shown in this video were standard hi-lift blades, that only are good for cutting and throwing the grass clippings out the side of the deck or up into a rear bagger unit, the other type of mower blade is a mulching blade, which is a funny looking wavy blade that has alot of flat and raised areas on the top surface, a mulching blade also has a trailing edge to create an upwards air draft to lift,cut and when mulching throw the clippings upwards (towards the top of the deck&#39;s underside) then the blade also creates a downdraft air flow or downdraft pressure that sucks the clippings back into the blade to be cut repeatedly, then there are gator blades that have a serrated trailing edge, the serrated teeth do not cut the grass, those are the air lifts (trailing edge) the teeth are bent to where they are directed towards the center of the mower deck where they redirect the air flow that pushes the clippings up and down back over the cutting edge to be cut into tiny tiny particles. I hope this information clarifies some things on how a lawn mower blade cuts the grass, one other thing to mention, a lawn mower blade regardless of what type it is - it is a lawn mower blade and all lawn mowers blades have one thing in common - they all cut the grass.", "comment_date": "2018-12-28T20:18:00Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Fred Hollands", "comment_text": "How much better is the highlift blades versus low lift?

This leaves the burr to cut the wrapped around grass blade which has been working well but as I see your high speed action I\u2019m thinking about gently turning the wire edge to neutral as with a standard cutting tool as there is less wrapping/friction action than just straight cutting unless of course the blade is getting dull in which case it\u2019s back to ripping/dragging  action.", "comment_date": "2018-08-27T03:40:58Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "impoverished millionaire", "comment_text": "chainsaw vs chaps and jeans shoes etc at 50000 fps!", "comment_date": "2018-08-26T23:12:48Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Neil Rogers", "comment_text": "This has got to be one of the funniest yet educational videos I&#39;ve ever seen.

And I will agree that there are a lot of factors at play in a mower, and fine to speculate in an informed way. But all that said, some commenters here have pointed out some factors you skipped over - such as grass blade inertia (no need to go to &quot;moment of inertia...&quot;) - and one you (of all people!) seem to have missed - air viscosity - that are at play. Without measures or at least an approximate quantitative assessment, hard to be sure where the &quot;meat&quot; of the cut process is, but I suspect most of the cutting happens because of fast-moving cutting blades hitting grass blades that cannot move out of the way of the sharp edge due to inertia and air resistance, before their shear limit is exceeded and the blade is &quot;cut.&quot; - exacty the inertial cut you dismissed in your paper demo. Air moving in the housing due to the blade lips is into the housing around the outer edges (thus blowing the blades horizontal centripetally near the outer edge), then in a circular manner around and above the cutting blade (thus tending to lay the blades down in a circular pattern), then out of the housing through the shute. I can&#39;t imagine there is very much lifting of the blades upward the way you describe, as that would really require pulling air out of the ground... :)", "comment_date": "2018-07-26T23:19:02Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "patchworking", "comment_text": "DESTIN!!!

I&#39;ve been trying to find the answer to the following question for years, but I keep getting the same reply from people in the know.  But I don&#39;t believe it.  Maybe you can help.<br>Since you have a degree in aeronautical engineering, you should be able to explain the question.  The question is this:<br>When a simple airplane is in a constant altitude turn of a random angle of bank of say 60 degrees relative to the natural horizon, is the outer wing flying faster than the inner wing or are both wingtips flying at the same airspeed?<br>     I maintain they are both flying at the same airspeed, but most of the pilots I know say the outer wing is flying faster because it has a greater arc to turn in the same amount of time as the inner wing.  I would agree with this if we were talking about a helicopter blade when comparing the speed of the inner part near the hub as to the wingtip.  But in an airplane that&#39;s turning, the wings are not connected to the ground.  Think of the wings as one long wing.<br>     I believe when the wing is turning in a level altitude it doesn&#39;t &quot;know&quot; the difference whether it&#39;s level or doing a loop.  The earth just happens to be a nearby object that our eyes use for comparison.<br>Of course, the earth provides an atmosphere for there to be life, but you can also hypothesize a similar situation in outer space where there is an atmosphere.  What do you say?  Are both wingtips flying at the same airspeed or not?

If this logic you explained was the correct one then why not have a longer lift on the blade to create more suction. I understand it could create more resistance to the blade if you do so. But It would not affect the cut as much. Also, you could have tested to proof you hypothesis by cutting off the lifts at the end of the blades and notice the change. Will it still cut the grass? I believe so. But my hypothesis is that when you go for tall grass it will slow down and maybe stop because it is not capable of shooting out the grass so it will accumulate and possibly stop the engine. Another thing is that if the lifts on the blades were distributed evenly on the blade. The grass closer to the point of rotation could get shot up to the ceiling of the mower creating hard compacted grass and eventually creating problems and giving you more maintenance because now you have to scrape it off.   \ud83d\ude01\ud83d\udc4d", "comment_date": "2018-07-11T01:01:22Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Edward Heck", "comment_text": "sickle bar mower", "comment_date": "2018-07-11T00:58:02Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "i was never here", "comment_text": "If the mower blade sucks the grass up, how does a hover mower  work", "comment_date": "2018-07-11T00:32:29Z", "likes_count": 9}, {"comment_by": "systematic101", "comment_text": "i always thought it was the speed of the blade and inertia of the grass. if the blade is fast enough then it should cut the grass before the inertial state of the changes enough to follow the blade. like if you swing a sharp blade slowly at paper it wont cut but swing it fast and it&#39;ll cut while the paper hardly moves. i think the lifting force from the blade has to do with sending the grass out the shoot.", "comment_date": "2018-07-11T00:17:24Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Neo Baggins", "comment_text": "Do you think Gavin will be upset that you became The Slow MOW Guy?", "comment_date": "2018-07-11T00:10:57Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Liam Brewer", "comment_text": "how does a sythe work", "comment_date": "2018-07-11T00:10:08Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Peatawn", "comment_text": "Weed-eater don&#39;t have a lift blade.

I thought it was for throwing the cut blades of grass into the collection box.<br><br>That said - your vid has also explained to me why my neighbour has rejected some new &#39;improved&#39; lawn mowers for his business, that he told me about a few years ago..  He is a Golf Course manager, looking after everything from paths, drainage and irrigation to the fairways and greens.  He told me that the manufacturer had added more blades to a barrel or cylinder type cutter, and would give a better cut for his greens.  He described the sales pitch like a well known gents razor, with added blades equalling a better cut.  When he tried out the new cutters - they weren&#39;t working as well as they as advertised.  The manufacturer didn&#39;t believe him initially.  They had invested in computer simulations and the like, he said.  After further tests - it was shown that the added blade was actually causing the grass to flatten slightly- resulting in a bad cut.  I think he said there was an increase in pressure.  This wasn&#39;t accounted for by the manufacturer.  Not good, when in summer he is measuring the cut in fractions of a millimetre, everyday.  Roughly 0.3mm is equal to just under 12 thousandths of an inch.  So now his equipment is all back to the previous cutter.  More is not necessarily a good thing.<br><br>I know your vid shows a rotary blade cutter, and barrel/cylinder type cutters have a bar to cut against - like your scissors, but the aerodynamics you talked about came to mind.<br><br>Watching your vid at approx <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlJFVTzEsI&amp;t=7m47s\">7:47</a>, you can see why manufacturers go for a two bladed design.<br><br>1. for simplicity of manufacturing and cost.<br>2.

However, they make a rougher cut on each individual blade of grass. This problem can be reduced by sharpening the blades regularly. Also note the cut varies depending on the position of the blade when it strikes the grass. When the blade is moving forward in relation to the direction the mower is traveling, it is moving faster than the tip on the opposite side in relation to stationary blades of grass; blade tip speed plus forward motion as opposed to blade tip speed minus forward motion. If you mow a section of grass moving forward and then re-mow the same section moving backward, you will find a flatter smoother cut because of the blade tips speed change in relation to the stationary grass when changing from forward to reverse mowing directions. The faster you travel while mowing the more pronounced this effect will be. A mower with two blades one behind the other and turning in opposite directions would produce a smoother flatter cut. However such a mower would be more expensive and ungainly. We use rotary mowers because they are less expensive and produce a barely acceptable cut. If you want a really smooth cut, use a push type reel mower. You will find it quite energy efficient (It uses your energy so no workouts at the gym are required). They are surprisingly easy to push! It won&#39;t cut thick stems so you will have to keep your lawn free of twigs. Additionally,  it will require special sharpening and adjustment. You can do this yourself but it takes a bit of study&#39; and practice, even if you are mechanically inclined. Therefore, you can see why rotary mowers are used in the vast majority of cases. Want to see reel mowers in action? Go to a good golf course and you will see multiple reel mowers pulled in gangs behind a tractor. Another option is to fence your lawn and raise sheep. That&#39;s how to grass was kept short around old English country manors. The cut won&#39;t be very smooth but you can get your lawn mowed without equipment and you can watch the work in progress while sipping a cold one. Caution, there is other work involved in keeping sheep but your sheperd can take care of that.

A few observations: 1) In the old days before mowers were powered by gas (or electric) motors, there were &#39;reel mowers&#39; that actually did cut like scissors. There was a stationary &#39;blade&#39; across the front of the mower. The wheels on the mower were connected to an open drum like mechanism with a set of rotating oblique blades that pressed up against and moved across the stationary blade in front - effectively cutting the grass much like scissors. 2) I suspect in modern mowers the tab on the blade is more about airflow to get clippings to move out the discharge shoot rather than to create lift to cut the blade. Although, mulching blades do have a larger tab to create more lift and more circulation in the cutting chamber. 3) The cutting action is improved with a sharper blade in two ways - motor efficiency and cleaner cutting action. If the blade is dull there is more resistance to blade rotation and the engine has to work harder. You may have heard your engine get bogged down in tall grass? It will do the same thing even in a lawn that is not overly tall if the blade is not sharp.  The second benefit of a sharp blade is a cleaner cut on the blade of grass. A cleaner cut means there is less &#39;pull&#39; on the grass blade when it is cut causing less damage to the grass plant. It also make a more regular, sharper cut line on the grass blade which is more healthy for the grass plant and makes the freshly cut lawn look better. A dull mower blade is like using a broom stick for a mower blade. The speed and action would &#39;cut&#39; the grass, but see how the motor bogs down when you do so and examine the grass blades after mowing. The ends of the grass blades will be frayed and stringy and in a day or two there will be a straw coloring across the lawn where the frayed ends have died and dried out.   A mower blade with a knife sharp edge will run much easier, give a more event cut, will leave the lawn looking more green in the days following a mowing and will be more healthy for the grass plant over it&#39;s life.

Yeah, we\u2019re pretty exciting folks. \ud83d\ude44 Anyway, I\u2019ve been running Oregon G5 Gator mulching blades and though they certainly do cut the unusually thick grass we\u2019ve had this Spring and early summer, they also have been leaving a thick row of expelled trimmings, which we have to then rake up. The mulching blades\u2019 tab is split into fins. I never understood why until watching your video. It seems by splitting that tab into fins, there would be less lift thereby encouraging the grass to stay under the deck longer and get in contact with the blades more before being expelled and be expelled at less velocity. I have a set of high-lift blades being delivered today, so we will see if that is true. If so, our clippings with these new blades will get dispersed farther and hopefully not require raking. However, your comment on requiring more horsepower due to increased drag means we will need to mow slower (or increase our horsepower, which we can\u2019t easily do). I have since been told to use the mulching blades in the Fall when leaves are falling and the high lift blades during the heart of mowing season.

In fact on a flymo lawnmower the lift is the other way round to get the mower to hover over the ground. They cut just fine but just chew the cuttings up into a pulp to feed the lawn. <br><br>2) cutting is all to do with the resistance a blade of grass has to the incoming blade. When this exceeds the local strength of the grass it is severed. The grass can resist the incoming blade either by stiffness, damping or inertia forces. Stiffness can be overcome by a very sharp thin blade as in a scythe but a blunt edge moving very fast will predominantly be resisted by the inertia of the grass (resistance to get up to the speed of the blade due to the mass of the grass).  Damping forces probably don\u2019t contribute much. <br>Hence a strimmer which just uses a nylon cord is quite capable of cutting grass. No lift or sharpness required.  <br><br>3) there are lawnmowers that do use shearing like scissors. Cylindrical mowers do just that where a rotating cylindrical blade cuts against a stationary lower blade over which the grass passes. There are also tractor driven cutters that operate just like a barbers trimmer.", "comment_date": "2018-07-04T23:33:29Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "KingKinggTv", "comment_text": "Lawn watering tractor!<br>Amazon it, i have a old original one and works great on watering large properties xD", "comment_date": "2018-07-04T23:28:35Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "MentalDMA", "comment_text": "<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlJFVTzEsI&amp;t=5m40s\">5:40</a> is what you came to see", "comment_date": "2018-07-04T23:19:56Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Blake King", "comment_text": "So your wife told you to mow the lawn, and you asked yourself &quot;How can I make a video out of this?&quot;", "comment_date": "2018-07-04T23:17:03Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Acie Rinoxydable", "comment_text": "<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlJFVTzEsI&amp;t=2m32s\">2:32</a> NOW THAT&#39;S A LOT OF DAMAGE!", "comment_date": "2018-07-04T23:12:21Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Radio_ATIS Radio_ATIS", "comment_text": "Destin, riddle me this:  if the airflow is important, then why does a mulch (no out flow) still work.

And I would like to see it in slow motion where the chain saw is just cutting off a chain-width of wood so we can actually see the chain teeth cutting the wood.  In other words, cut a log in two.  Then just slice off a chain width of wood from the face of the log so we can see the teeth cutting.   You might need a fixture to hold the chain saw accurately because it might be difficult to cut just a chain width off the face of a log by hand.<br><br>Do this in both directions.   In other words, once against the wood grain, (like cutting normal firewood logs), and then once cutting length wise (i.e. along the the actual length of the log).  <br><br>I&#39;d like to see this because I know that the chips that come off are quite different.  When cutting lengthwise the chips are very long and stringy, when cutting cross-grain the chips are more &quot;normal&quot; like cutting firewood.  <br><br>There&#39;s also another direction I&#39;m not sure what to call it.   If you cut a firewood log, and then stand it straight up and cut down from the top straight down the resulting chips are extremely fine like dust.   That&#39;s neither with the grain or against the grain.  In fact, I don&#39;t even know what you would call that.<br><br>Sawmill:<br><br>My second idea is to do the same thing with bandsaw blades.  It&#39;s not really yard equipment, but I have a portable bandsaw and I would like to see how the teeth cut on that too.  Again, this could be filmed by just skimming off a single blade-width of wood which is easy to do on a sawmill. <br><br>The main thing with the sawmill blade would be to film the difference between blades that are designed for softwood and have a large angle to the cutting teeth, versus blades that are designed for hardwood that have a straighter angle to the cutting teeth. <br><br>Just suggestions.", "comment_date": "2018-07-04T22:58:28Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "John D", "comment_text": "A guy in high school got part of his fingers cut off while mowing.

Instead a robot mower often use 3 razor sharp blades on a small metal disc in most cases however I have seen some such mowers with solid steel rotors as well.

The reel mower uses a scissor action with littl lifting of the grass below the cut bar.

So, at least every few times, you need to use a rotary mower to lift the grass/weeds for a uniform cut.  <br><br>I toyed with the idea of some kind of rake on the front of the reel mower to lift the grass/weeds that stayed low and avoid their taking over the yard.

However it would be wise to note that rotary mowers isn&#39;t exactly the cleanest cut or the most efficient. Reels on the other hand act more like scissors because of the spinning reel pushing the grass against the bedknife. The mower itself uses less energy to cut the same blade of grass and the box in which it is housed acts similar to a rotary mower in the sense that they too will suck the blades of grass upwards so that it may be cut. On the other hand they are more effective on certain type of grass like Bermuda and the grass must be mowed a little more often cause your not afforded to let it get too tall.

Did anyone notice the similarity of a mower with a tabbed blade and contoured chute to a centrifugal water pump? They both work on the same principle: the rotation of the blade causes the air and cut grass to be flung against the outside of the shaped chute then hurled into the catcher by centrifugal force, just as the vaned rotor of a centrifugal water pump sucks water in from the central inlet then by rapid rotation flings it out the outlet on the rim by centrifugal force.

A better question would be: Why does the mower continue to work when the tabs would be stalled in the inertial reference frame of the lawn? A few ideas suggest themselves. First, the tabs may be behaving as a rudimentary radial flow pump. IOW, the radial flow may dominate. Second, grass clippings + air put us squarely in the realm of two-phase flow. The clippings impacting the tabs and being flung upward drag air along with them, and this may be a significant contribution to the flow. Third, and finally for now, the blade operates at the interface of the lawn and the clippings. The blades of grass are going to slow the flow relative to the blade on the underside. One could imagine this (somehow) sucking the clippings back down into the lawn, were it not for the disruptive effect of the tabs, for example by the aforementioned impact dynamic, or through vortex shedding and entrainment. The latter two would contribute to radial and tangential flow that further the hypothesis of &quot;crude centrifugal pump.&quot;<br><br>At some point, the value proposition of Smarter Every Day shifts from &quot;smarter&quot; to &quot;feeling smarter.&quot; I hope it stays with the former, though the pressures of the medium probably conspire toward the latter.", "comment_date": "2018-07-02T18:02:30Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Levi Matteson", "comment_text": "You should do a scythe like the grim reaper thing", "comment_date": "2018-07-02T18:01:47Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Elk", "comment_text": "GO FULL MIKE BOYD AND LEARN TO USE A SCYTHE!", "comment_date": "2018-07-02T18:00:34Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Conor Drew", "comment_text": "When using a strimmer why do we use the plastic rope stuff that wears away why not use metal like a lawn mower, I know it would weigh a bit more but the plastic one is being consumed", "comment_date": "2018-07-02T17:59:56Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Blaine Lewis", "comment_text": "Edgers, pole chain saw, power washer, wood chipper, tree line saw/trimmer for right of ways and electric poles, scythe/yoyo/slingblade, tiller, ditch witch (just some ideas)", "comment_date": "2018-07-02T17:59:47Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Lim Yang Kwang", "comment_text": "Try trimming off the tab and see if it changes anything", "comment_date": "2018-07-02T17:58:46Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Mocapz Family", "comment_text": "Very interesting.

But in the process of figuring that out, I found that there&#39;s a consortium of people who maintain golf courses and do research about the science involved in cutting grass.  It had to do with how much energy the blade has to impart to the grass to split the fibers, etc.  I wish I could find it now, but if you look for it, there&#39;s a quite a bit of data on this subject, which explains why we use rotating blades as opposed to clipper-style blades.  I still think clippers could be made to work if they were re-designed, as opposed to re-purposed from a hedge trimmer.  <br>Also, the only way to make your lawn carbon-neutral is to have a machine mowing it, because a human will exhale more carbon just waking around the lawn than the grass is able to sequester.

Secondarily if it was necessary for the airflow like this then all mowers would share the same design. Many tractor slashers etc, have flat or near flat blades at the end of flat square sections,  spinning circular inside a square housing, not creating any real airflow. I think mostly design of those blades is to improve discharge by directing the cut grass irrespective of airflow to reduce the need to cut longer pieces many times therefore reducing horsepower etc. Would love to see the difference in slow-mo with a mower in a vacuum, or flat blades vs curved blades or even wing shaped laminar flow designed blades.", "comment_date": "2018-07-02T10:17:13Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Gkman Kowal", "comment_text": "Do a push reel mower", "comment_date": "2018-07-02T10:16:27Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Pehr Meldert", "comment_text": "a combine harvester works like a big barbershop clipper", "comment_date": "2018-07-02T10:14:52Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Max V.", "comment_text": "Do a video with a wire blade weed-whacker.

I am too old. I remember when the only consumer level mowers did use opposing shear line technology, which was necessary for a human powered hand reel type mower. Those reel blades shear the grass just like you scissors do.<br>The crappy engine powered lawn mower you ride, or your neighbor pushes, is a product of 1950&#39;s cost cutting for consumers. That was when retailers like Sears began selling a much cheaper version of the Toro mower, itself a cheaper way of engine powering a mower. Engine powered mowers with reels were only affordable to professionals and golf courses back then. <br>So what made you think that all consumer grade powered mowers always used single rotor blade tip velocity as a standard? <br>you never knew it to be different. My Dad bought my brother and I a Sears rotary mower when we were teens because of the cheap price and our promise to pay him back by mowing neighbors lawns for money. We hated the push mower, a reel type that needed fine adjustment to keep it shearing smoothly, but that we tended to just  tighten the fixed blade enough to stay cutting reasonably well and almost never oiled.  That motorized mower, even from Sears, the Walmart of its day, cost a lot more than a reel mower, the standard at that time. Gas acquisition to operate it and the cantankerous starting  with a rope pull, made it as much of a maintenance chore as its manual counter-part, but it did make the cutting itself easier. Its noise was not appreciated by neighbors either. Cheapness and consumption, replacement of the poor quality engine and gumming up of the spark plug from the leaded gas were endemic. They have improved in reliability, but adding driving and riding once every body began to think of paying for them as normal, means we have forgotten a type of mower that can last a lifetime and give oneself good exercise as well as do a crisper sheared lawn surface more akin to a golf course.", "comment_date": "2018-07-02T06:30:06Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "45von", "comment_text": "If you want to see a sheering action cut grass, Watch a Reel mower Or a Sickle mower... they both cut grass with opposing blades sheering action.", "comment_date": "2018-07-02T06:29:16Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Michael Kenyon", "comment_text": "best part about life in the high desert, other than low light pollution.... no summer lawn mower noise pollution", "comment_date": "2018-07-02T06:28:56Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Daniel Binoy", "comment_text": "That audio on the slo mo...beautifully done", "comment_date": "2018-07-02T06:28:47Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Maumau", "comment_text": "That WASTED sound from GTAV at <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlJFVTzEsI&amp;t=3m12s\">3:12</a>", "comment_date": "2018-07-02T06:28:44Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Trevor Baker", "comment_text": "What about a scythe?", "comment_date": "2018-07-02T06:27:51Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Jeffery Bernard", "comment_text": "How dumb", "comment_date": "2018-07-02T06:27:46Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Joel Kreider", "comment_text": "Seems like a prime opportunity to visit a potential sponsor for the series, and discuss design physics... although you might not want to go to just one.

Definitely a video on weed eating. I understand how concrete and rocks wear down the string but how does grass do it? How fast does it spin? I have a ton of questions on that. When you trim the grass (string is perpendicular to the grass blades) is torque causing the direction of discharge? Also, why do some grasses grab more than others? Like st. Augustine trims beautifully, but something like zoysia or Bermuda has a tendency to grab the weed eater and drag it into the grass. Does it help to remove the guard and have more string out, or better to have it short. When edging, there\u2019s this thing that happens where the weed eater will lock into the edge and you can almost run without it hopping out. What is that? Is gyroscopic procession involved when you squeeze the throttle and the weed eater rotates slightly, or is that something else? Does the string have wobble in it or does it spin out straight? When this happens is the string going fast enough to treat it as a  blade (like a circular saw blade) or like a lawnmower blade, just made out of string? Glad you are doing this!

This force that is required to accelerate the blade of grass creates tension in the grass causing it to tear.

Finally a topic on which I know a thing or two. Wish you talked more about airflow as it is really the key to how a mower cuts. On a properly set up mower deck the blades are about a quarter inch lower in the front than in the back. This draws air in the back and then the spinning blades force the air out the chute. Commercial grade mowers always have deeper decks than residential mowers. Deeper decks move a larger volume of air and remove grass clippings faster. If the mower deck is constantly clogged up with grass the mower can&#39;t lift the grass and cut it properly. This results in poor cut quality.

I doubt they cause much of the suction you refer to in this video, and I can&#39;t help but think the blades are traveling far slower.  it also seems like each section(or even blade) of grass would only have one chance to get cut with a rotary mower, whereas the rotating blade mowers(even though the cutting surface of the blade is only a few inches long at the extreme end of each side of the blade) has several chances to cut each blade(depending on how fast you are going) and thus is less likely to leave little &quot;mohawks&quot; of uncut grass behind.)<br>I suppose it could be due in part to the fact that the blades on rotary mowers are moving more or less straight in into the grass(almost like a scythe) whereas the blades on the type of mower in this video are rotating in an angular fasion, and may be more likely to &quot;rip&quot; the blade as opposed to making a clean cut, but since the blade is moving so fast, and the moment of contact between the blade and any individual piece of grass is so incredibly brief, I can&#39;t help but think  that the direction/way the blades are moving would make no difference(if the blades were cutting right near the center of blade, where the linear velocities would be lower, then maybe.)<br>the only other thing I can think of is that maybe the blades on drum style rotary mowers are sharper(please sharpen your mower blades regularly people), possible due to them being just simple pieces of think stamped metal(at least I think they&#39;re stamped, i could be wrong.)<br>wow.  god bless whoever took the time to read that ridiculously long comment about lawn mower blades.  lol.", "comment_date": "2018-07-01T22:40:02Z", "likes_count": 20}, {"comment_by": "Christopher Horton", "comment_text": "I wish I could share this with Hank Hill", "comment_date": "2018-07-01T22:39:57Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "3D Prints - LIVE!", "comment_text": "You really need to sharpen your lawnmower blades, these just tear or bend the grass.", "comment_date": "2018-07-01T22:39:29Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Kevin Klika", "comment_text": "Please do a video on how the tap-to-extend string trimmer heads work!", "comment_date": "2018-07-01T22:39:27Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Frederikja", "comment_text": "how about axes. aleays been interested in how they split the wood, but you can also cut wood with them (chopping trees or making small wood items)", "comment_date": "2018-07-01T22:39:14Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Preston", "comment_text": "I just got off from watching trailer park boys and I&#39;m currently watching j roc cut gras.

Think about it, in a just a little over an hour, the tips of your blade are going to travel  through a strip of grass the distance the length of Alabama top to bottom.  Notice how most used blades don&#39;t seem broken or chipped, but melted.  That is because the friction of the grass on the metal at those speeds does gradually melt away the metal and is why it is better to cut your grass with a sharp blade, AND when the grass is slightly damp (you don&#39;t want to cut while totally wet because it will just create a mess and grass clogs).  The cooling effect of the water will minimize the burning off of metal and you can literally go years without having to sharpen or replace the blade, barring hitting debris like rocks and such while cutting your yard.  I also noticed your grass tips look a little tattered as a result of using a dull blade. Not good. You want the grass to have good clean cut edges to minimize entry of bacteria and fungi, which will produce healthier looking grass.  Keep those blades sharp!

You can get blades that don&#39;t have lift tabs and they cut just fine.

Mower deck is kind of a \u201cchamber\u201d, with lots of turbulence in the center 2/3\u2019s of it probably. Would the blade of the mower be comparable to an airplane wing with the back part tilted up at full extension? (I apologize, I don\u2019t know what the damper thing on the back of the wing is technically called.

If I understand you correctly, you have come to the conclusion that it is the air flow which holds the grass blades up for the cut, the same way you did, with your hand, in the demonstration at the beginning of the video. Please correct me if I am wrong on that. Looking at it from my experience, and knowledge of a fairly limited range of physics, the air flow creates enough lift to make the grass stand straighter than normal, though I do not believe that the air flow has enough strength to literally hold the blades up as they are being cut.  The mower blade has a tendency to push the blades of grass out of its way, but the faster that mower blade is moving, the greater the energy required to accelerate the blades of grass out of the way, until the energy required to cut the grass is less than the energy required to accelerate it out of the mower blades path. Now the way a mulching deck works, you may notice that they tend to have a deeper, rounded area around the perimeter of the deck. The mulching blade creates enough air flow that it forms a vortex in the rounded area, and repeatedly circulates the grass cuttings through the blade until the pieces no longer have sufficient sail area to be held in the vortex, and they fall to the ground. Many multi purpose decks do not have that chamber around the perimeter, and are less efficient at mulching than a dedicated mulching deck. I do not have the background to be able to explain this all in proper physical terms. If you decide to go further in to this, whether it is to say why I am wrong, or just to better explain the physics, I would certainly be interested.

Its possible someone already mentioned this but here it is again anyway. When I was a kid I remember looking at the blade on our lawnmower.

In the UK we have a company called Flymo and they have for ages made mowers that hover, like a hover craft does. It makes it very easy swipe the mower side to side instead of one that has wheels and only goes in straight lines. As soon as you mentioned that something must be holding the grass up, it totally made sense that the air was pulling it up. That&#39;s fine for the conventional wheeled mower.

Here are a couple of ideas. Remember the old fashioned push mowers? The blades were essentially in the shape of a cylinder, which was parallel to the ground, and cut the grass on the leading edge of the mower, so less chance for lift. I&#39;ve never had one but my next door neighbor when I grew up had one. I remember him pushing it across his yard, push and pull, the ol&#39; 3 steps forward, 2 steps back. Took a lot more work.  Maybe something on how those old mowers worked, although it might be hard to find one. Another question: there are grass trimmers/&quot;weed wackers&quot; that use plastic line to cut the grass and weeds. Some even have the ability to release additional line as needed, rather than having to stop and manually pull out more line from time to time. That might be another cool discussion of the physics between the centripetal (centrifugal?) forces pulling the line away from the center and the physical stop holding the line from just all spinning out.

The trailing edge is to add some more lift but also to aid in removing clippings/mulching depending on blade style.

For instance my battery powered (EGO is the brand) mower has a pretty small wing to get better battery life, but has the tradeoff of not being able to bag as well as some other blades.

Were you able to distinguish between the grass just bouncing back upright after being struck by the blade versus the airflow created by the flap?

Were some of these shots taken as the blade was spinning up?  Steady state would have been harder to film given that the grass was already cut once you got going.  A cylinder mower blade seems to work without the same shaping which would suggest blade speed is more important but this should be investigated further.<br><br>Some follow up on this would be interesting to see.

Look at your video it more or less tears it like you tore the paper with your hand.  It&#39;s really not a healthy way to cut grass, but more efficient on fuel.  Now check out what kind of mower golf courses use. It&#39;s more of a power reel mower.  It cuts the grass blades like a scissor does paper.  It&#39;s so different than a regular push mower and the cut is clean.  This makes the grass heal faster and stay green.

As I look closer at the high-speed video, I see grass blades that get struck by the mower blade, lie flat for a moment, recoil upright and get struck again. Repeat until the blade of grass gets severed. I don&#39;t buy it that there is some sucking power (lift) that draws the blades of grass up and holds them upright to get whacked off by the high speed mower blade. I think the bent blades were designed to provide loft (basically turbulence) of the severed grass particles to increase discharge from the mower deck. If airflow was the main purpose, why are not mower blades shaped more like an airplane propeller with a sharpened leading edge?

I think opening the discharge has the same effect as cutting out the front of the mower - it disrupts the air flow and thus the &quot;normal&quot; grass/airflow interaction. I suggest   cutting a large hole in your mower deck and forming a clear plastic widow in the shape of the portion you cut out. Install the plastic window in the cutout hole and then filming. In this way the air flow will be minimally disturbed from normal and you will be able to see what really happens. Filming needs to be done as the mower moves forward an normal speed. <br>I suspect you will find that there is a very high &quot;vertical&quot; air flow in the area between the deck and the blade tip that &quot;lifts/sucks&quot; the grass up to be cut by the next blade as the mower moves forward. I also suspect that if there was a coanda shaped edge on the mower deck and a toroidal space inside but beyond the blade radius you could suck much more air in at the near the blade end. This space would also the radial air flow a place to go.

I think the problem lies with the composition of the dirt where I live. I live in Chugwater, Wyoming. The soil comp is mostly very powdery. It has the strangest properties. For example, even after a huge moisture event within a very short period (hours) you can walk on the property and when you go into the house there is hardly any evidence of going outside. Then, in the days where the soil has really dried up and I have to mow I really am just reorganizing the dirt (which we call chalk-rock).<br>Now. Here is my dilemma. I am running an 18 horse Kubota KX1850 with a 48 inch deck. The blades are considered very high lift. The mower deck has pathways in the construct for efficient airflow for maximum cut results. Well. That is okay as long as you are cutting grass. But the terrain has about 60% dirt and 40% bio-mass material (grass, dandelions, native sweet clover, weeds), basically prarie. When I take the mower-deck off the mower cavity is TOTALLY plugged with a nearly concrete hard collection of the dirt that has been lifted and impacted on the underside of the deck. I can spend as much as 2 hours with an oscillating tool removing the horrible media. The first time I did it I used an air-chisel! I find the oscillating tool less harmful to the metal of the mower-deck.<br>I have a theory. The dirt is such fine material and the ultra-high lift property of the blades blasts the underside of the mower-deck.  In fact I think the blades, when spinning at full-throttle, atomizes the dirt even more and &#39;paints&#39; the metal (a rough surface really) and then builds thickness. It is so bad that it grinds the tips of the blades as the collection of dirt builds to the point that it interferes with the path of the blades (3x @ $56/pop). I have to replace the blades at least 2 times each summer (after 3 mowings). <br>I am the only person with this problem in our town. But I am the only one with this large a mower and with the proprietary Kubota blades (I experimented with some mulching blades--lower lifting properties) but then the lift was missing and the blades did not cut efficiently because when you use mulching blades you also need to choke off the discharge chute.<br>I have discovered some things that help. <br>1) After a good mower-deck cleaning make sure the first area mowed is the part of the &#39;lawn&#39; that has a lot of grass. I do have 2 areas where the grass to dirt ratio is about 80/20. That puts a layer of somewhat moist media on the underside of the deck. Mow this prior to hitting the very dusty areas. By doing this there is at least a &#39;buffer zone&#39; of grassy accumulation between the deck and the dust.<br>2) Reduce the RPM when possible. The blades will still function properly as they are ultra-high-lift blades. By lowering the RPM in extremely dusty areas less dust/dirt will be impacted on the metal surface.<br><br>The problem is so bad that I have even worn a filtered mask with charcoal filters. From a block away it looks like a cloud of smoke coming from the parsonage lawn!! No one believes me when I tell them the difficulty of removing the &#39;concrete&#39; from the underside of the mower-deck until they see it for themselves.<br><br>Help!!<br><br>I look forward to comments and suggestions.", "comment_date": "2018-07-01T10:55:36Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Ryan Foss", "comment_text": "For fairways and greens they still use reel style lawn mowers for &#39;better looking cut&#39;.

Think about a card from a deck of cards. At the right speed those can penetrate into cork board. Well, you&#39;ve got metal whipping along at 200mph, which is probably fast enough that the blades of grass can&#39;t bend out of the way faster than the blade of the mower passes through them. And since the grass naturally wants to stand up, it gets torn or cut at about the height of the blade. Those blades are passing over each area about 45 times a second, so even if it doens&#39;t get a good cut on the first pass, it will on the next 45+ passes.<br>The airflow is more likely used to get rid of the detritus, not make the blades stand up.", "comment_date": "2018-07-01T09:33:35Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Melvin van der Meulen", "comment_text": "Can you do a video on a hand pushed non motorised lawn mower?", "comment_date": "2018-07-01T09:32:14Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Moto Fun", "comment_text": "I learn about more things on this channel than I learn at school :)", "comment_date": "2018-07-01T09:31:50Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Chris Ojiem", "comment_text": "Grass was hurt in the making of this video", "comment_date": "2018-07-01T09:31:39Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Herm Ask", "comment_text": "He could&#39;ve asked the grim reaper, he also uses just one blade.", "comment_date": "2018-07-01T09:31:20Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "drewdane40", "comment_text": "If you&#39;re going to do a lawnmower series, you absolutely must do a collab with Project Farm.", "comment_date": "2018-07-01T09:30:08Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "peter navarro", "comment_text": "Whipper snippers or weed wackers fundamentaly are they the same as lawnmowers ?", "comment_date": "2018-07-01T09:30:07Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "How To Guys", "comment_text": "&quot;No Grass is harmed during this video?&quot;", "comment_date": "2018-07-01T09:29:45Z", "likes_count": 106}, {"comment_by": "Dominique Ricks", "comment_text": "Why doed a hedge trimmer work better on hedge than chainsaw?", "comment_date": "2018-07-01T09:29:39Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Kehny Alexandre", "comment_text": "Lift and drag are not proportional, they are quadratic :D<br>Cx=Cx0 + (Cz^2)\\(pi*lambda*fq)<br><br>Where lambda is the ratio of the wingspan divided by the surface.<br>And fq is the &quot;facteur de qualit\u00e9&quot; (ie quality factor) wich describe the ability of your wing to minimize the vortex created at your wingtip :)<br><br>-A French Engineering Student at ISAE-ENSMA", "comment_date": "2018-07-01T09:29:39Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Matt Blood", "comment_text": "One of the few inventions that has come from the great Australia!", "comment_date": "2018-07-01T09:29:03Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "OAK Studio", "comment_text": "please don&#39;t do this series. it&#39;s irrelevant for the rest of the world who don&#39;t have any lawns and don&#39;t care about it. there are  a million different things you can make series out of.  please.", "comment_date": "2018-07-01T09:28:59Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Rob Mckennie", "comment_text": "Reel mowers work with opposing blades, there&#39;s a stationary piece inside the mower that the reel spins past", "comment_date": "2018-07-01T09:28:58Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Greasemonkey Chris", "comment_text": "You can have a mower that cuts the lawn like a pair of scissors!

The &quot;lift tab&quot;, if it gives the wing tip any camber at all would mean a negative angle of attack of the resultant chord, and the tab would actually be creating the high pressure zone above the bar, and the lower pressure under, resulting in a downforce on the blade tip. The tab is acting more like a &quot;vortex generator&quot; on a fixed airplane wing, with the turbulent vortex created in the wake of the blade providing the updraft that&#39;s straightening the grass.

Certainly it&#39;s useful overall, since it&#39;s what lets the lawnmower collect the grass in a bag or in the case of mulching mowers, suck it up so it gets hit by the blades again and again until it&#39;s shredded into little pieces.  However, an object moving at 200 MPH will rip or cut through grass regardless of airflow.  There&#39;s just too much friction against the edge of the blade and inertia making the grass fold over onto the blade as it moves past for there to be any chance of it somehow whipping back around and sliding under the blade intact.<br><br>I&#39;d like to see a control test with the curved lifting portions cut off to give a flat blade.  Also, what if you installed the blade upside down so that it provided down force?  A comparison of the quality of the lawn cut under these conditions would be very interesting!  This would test the assumption that the lifting blade pulls flattened blades back up straight again so they&#39;re cut to the same length as all the others.  If this is the case, doing a comparison immediately after mowing might be a mistake since any blades that were flattened by the mower may still be laying flat.  Better to give it 24 hours after mowing for the wind to straighten them up again first.<br><br>As far as I can tell, the lifting lawn mower blade is a relatively new invention.  Before this, blades were presumably flat, though sadly I can&#39;t find pictures of old lawn mower blades anywhere on Google.  Apparently there are no antique lawn mower blade collectors for some reason.<br><br>Now, what about cylinder blade lawn mowers?  The geometry on those makes no sense to me.

What I was instead interested in was if it would be better to modify the lawnmower blades to increase airflow even if it would require more energy to spin the blade, which was even mentioned in the video. I&#39;m interested in this because if you look at the high speed sometimes the blades of grass don&#39;t have enough time or uhh &quot;lift&quot; to upright itself for another pass of the lawnmower blade and increasing the air flow should pull the grass up faster and possibly resulting in a better cut.
