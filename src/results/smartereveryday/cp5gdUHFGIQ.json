Would the increased pressure mean that a rounder tip would fly straighter due to suffering less internal vibrations (like a submarine trying to run quieter), or would a long tip be better all around since a bullet is solid instead of hollow like a submarine? I noticed that in the slowmo guy&#39;s video the hollow point went straighter through the water, but they didn&#39;t mention how far either of their shots flew like you did, and they never mentioned the caliber of bullet. I also noticed that your AK bullet tumbled much more than theirs did, probably due to its more conical shape and internal vibrations, as well as the length of the round with more mass at the tail end. Once sideways, I imagine it lost a lot of accuracy, and likely a lot of momentum. Given it has higher mass and more powder, it might have still flown just as far or even farther, but I still wonder which of the three flew the farthest and the straightest.<br><br>I wonder all of these things because I&#39;m making a Sci-fi that takes place on a planet with higher air pressure, and warfare is involved. I&#39;m curious which bullet would be more effective on an alien world with a soupy atmosphere. That being said, water is still significantly more dense and resistant than the atmosphere of my alien world, so maybe it wouldn&#39;t ultimately matter too much. So instead, this is probably more just a curiosity.", "comment_date": "2022-03-19T07:06:42Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "William Jhoansson", "comment_text": "Wow that so cool that the slowmo guys is here", "comment_date": "2022-03-07T18:51:17Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Jerry Yager", "comment_text": "Very good way to end up with shrapnel.", "comment_date": "2022-02-27T18:24:39Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Jeshua Konkel", "comment_text": "do one abowt the brain", "comment_date": "2022-02-22T00:38:14Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "No.1 Spectator", "comment_text": "Now that&#39;s a proper big bang in practical", "comment_date": "2022-02-20T06:59:24Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "\u041c\u0430\u043a\u0441\u0438\u043c \u0410\u0432\u0441\u0438\u043d\u043e\u0432", "comment_text": "\u043a\u0440\u0443\u0442\u043e\u0439 \u043e\u0431\u0437\u043e\u0440 \u0432\u044b\u0448\u0435\u043b, \u0441\u043f\u0430\u0441\u0438\u0431\u043e", "comment_date": "2022-02-16T17:43:47Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "rukozhop", "comment_text": "did you use glass mirrors or polished metal?", "comment_date": "2022-02-12T17:07:16Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "ASTROWORLD GANG", "comment_text": "Man that was awesome, I\u2019m from Spain and I can\u2019t wait to see another of your vids, you are amazing!", "comment_date": "2022-02-08T00:38:25Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Thomas Raithel", "comment_text": "Would like to have seen a few rounds fired back-to-back...", "comment_date": "2022-02-02T08:26:22Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "MSD Secretary", "comment_text": "hey", "comment_date": "2022-02-02T05:31:13Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "rj934", "comment_text": "I love your channel.

The Rayleigh-Plesset principle actually starts at the interface of those two pressure condition (hydraulic-to-ambient).  I wish there was an infra-red version of this video, because I would love to see the heat dissipation signature once the propellant gas and residue leave the barrel.

That all is unburned powder still burning outside of the barrel which causes the flash.<br>So those powder particles, still needing to burn off, are given the means to do so inside the expanding then contracting bubble, still hot enough to support ignition, then doing so when the conditions inside the bubble/chamber are just right.<br>And the rebounding bubble as you point out bounces, if you will, through several cycles until the atmospheric conditions equalize.<br>So there you have it.

If the bolt is not locked the bolt would go back way to soon and a lot of the gasses and the energy will simply be lost. The reason we have those gas operated rifles is so we give maximum inertia to the bullet possible but not wait to much because if the bolt is unlocked too late then the gases will escape the barrel after the bullet has come out and there won&#39;t be any pressure left to cycle the bolt. That&#39;s why the position of the small hole on the barrel that takes small part of the gas pressure to unlock the bolt is so important - too close to the end of the barrel - you risk experiencing a jam, too close to the entrance - the bolt will unlock and the pressure will escape way too soon before the bullet gets is maximum speed.", "comment_date": "2019-09-15T06:03:52Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Literally Bored", "comment_text": "I really want the camera to play CS GO", "comment_date": "2019-09-12T12:03:56Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "miggy rob", "comment_text": "I just learned that ak rounds tumble like a tornado.", "comment_date": "2019-09-11T14:20:22Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "KHAN 302", "comment_text": "This is called akm Chinese ak47 you should have to test on Russian ak47", "comment_date": "2019-09-10T07:36:37Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "AfroVersity", "comment_text": "I would have never seen this in my life", "comment_date": "2019-09-09T09:30:08Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Lars Murdoch Kalsta", "comment_text": "You see sonoluminescence in ballistics gel a lot so I can&#39;t imagine why it wouldn&#39;t happen here", "comment_date": "2019-09-07T21:42:43Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "riuphane", "comment_text": "I just love seeing slo mo guys collabs", "comment_date": "2019-09-06T15:30:39Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "gkarjala", "comment_text": "Mad respect for anyone who has cajones to do this.", "comment_date": "2019-09-04T14:52:56Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Chris Hernandez", "comment_text": "<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cp5gdUHFGIQ&amp;t=6m30s\">6:30</a> There&#39;s no pressure in a cavitation with no gases or air in it.

It is simply an average force over an area... and the force in a liquid or gas can be directed so that more of the average motion of the particles are in a certain direction and hence the average force exerted is also higher in that direction.  In static equilibrium, pressure is essentially equal in all directions over a small surface area at the same depth.  But while flowing the pressure is generally only lower at the boundaries orthogonal to the flow.  The pressure is actually higher along and in the direction of the flow than against the boundaries of the flow (i.e. tube walls).  If the pressure were also lower in the direction of the flow, it would be lower than the water outside the barrel and so it would not escape the barrel, rather it would be pushed back further inside the barrel by the higher-pressure water outside!  But that&#39;s not what happens.

It would be no coincidence that the bubble oscillation would then be in phase with the waves reaching the mirror.  So Destin is likely correct that it is not sonar luminescence and likely a &quot;reflection of the sunlight&quot;, but more specifically the change in apparent brightness is due to variation in angle of combined refraction/reflection through the mirror box.  If the camera were moved or the box manually vibrated, one might also see a change in the apparent brightness of the overall image.

Great work.  :D  I skimmed through the thread and didn&#39;t see it mentioned, so I thought I would drop a comment.  A lot of people look at bernoulli and lose sight of what it&#39;s saying - it really only applies to static systems in a gravity field.  You have either pressure head or potential energy, and if you stab a hole in the tank at the bottom he pressure is converted to kinetic energy.   I&#39;m not sure if you did that in your explanation at the end but I though I would put up how I&#39;m thinking about what&#39;s happening and you can decide for yourself.  <br><br>The instant the shot is fired the front of the bullet will transfer the pressure from behind the bullet and the water bullet system will be pushed out of the barrel as a slug. The pressure in the water in this instant has to increase because it is accelerating and we are putting energy into the system.  As the liquid water hits the end of the barrel it will act to accelerate the body of water around it in a turbulent spray like mess that we see in the video.  The momentum imparted here is enough to overcome the pressure exerted by the atmosphere and a bubble starts to form of near vacuum water vapor behind it.  The bullet is ejected and travels through the liquid water immediately in front of it driven by the gasses from combustion behind it.  it travels through the near vacuum and the gasses from combustion fill the bubble.  The bullet hits the far site of the vacuum and it&#39;s momentum is transferred in an organized fashion from the leading edge of the bullet.     As the bullet slows the angle that the momentum extends away from the bullet changes from near perpendicular when the speed of the bullet was near the speed of sound in water to near straight ahead of it as it&#39;s speed is much slower than that of the speed of sound in water.  The corkscrew pattern is a consequence of the bullet having spin and not imparting it&#39;s momentum to the water uniformly.  As the pressure from the atmosphere slows and reverses the momentum imparted to the water from the bullet, the bubbles stop expanding and start collapsing.  There is very little area to close from the entry hole of the bullet into the second bubble it made, and there are very little gasses in this bubble beyond water vapor.  The first bubble collapses and compresses the combustion gasses which forms a spring the incoming boundary of water bounces off of.  The second bubble collapses to almost nothing because there are no gasses in there, and as you were saying is a sono-luminescence candidate - although I don&#39;t think it will because the spin of the bullet will make the boundary helical and have uneven pressures at the boundary which will promote water vapor going back to water liquid.<br><br>Love your channel.  Wanted to put this out there as bernoulli was all the rage for a while and it was fashionable to talk in those terms when it was in vogue but it gets applied to a lot of areas where it&#39;s a really ineffective way of thinking through the problem (Airplane wings.. looking at you...).  I thought you might be interested in walking through a process around conserving momentum.  Momentum is always conserved.  If energy is also conserved than Bernoulli&#39;s equation can be used to yield equivalent results in sometimes more convent metrics.

That Barrell really flexes underwater, I think the pressure to the piston, and the piston mechanism contribute to this.  Also, I think the column of water in front of the projectile is actually moving the piston, if not completely it is at least starting the movement early.  If you take the cyclic operation of the AK into consideration, the piston, rod, bolt all only move back a small bit under power from the piston, until the piston passes the holes you talked about letting the gas bubbles out.  That small bit unlocks the bolt.  Once unlocked, the bolt itself is pushed back by blowback of the round (like a standard automatic pistol). In this case, that blowback is much more than normal because of the increased chamber pressure due to the water in the barrel as you already discussed.<br><br>Again, this is all just my own theories.

The fact that the cloud grows radially from the axis of the barrel proves that the pressure in the cloud is greater than the local water pressure.  It&#39;s not a region of low pressure.  Just because there&#39;s a high velocity flow of fluid does not mean that you can apply Bernoulli and conclude that the pressure is less in that flow.  For instance, if you squirt water from a hose into your pool or against your garage, the collision will produce increased (stagnation) pressure in the region of the collision.  A submerged jet, however, will cause regions of reduced pressure; i.e., in regions outside the jet proper, where fluid is entrained (&quot;pulled along&quot;) by the main jet. <br><br>An alternate explanation is that the cloud is a mixture of water and combustion products (gas) from the gunpowder.  The mixture is caused by the extreme turbulence caused by the gunpowder explosion.  This cloud can flow out of the barrel faster than the bullet because some gas always leaks between the projectile and the sides of the barrel, moving faster than the bullet.  (You can see this on other YouTube videos.)  This explanation is consistent with the fact that the rebound explosion that you noted also looks like a cloud, and again, I think it&#39;s a mixture of gas and water, forcibly mixed by the high pressure collision caused by the previous collapse of the bubble.   (Do you have an alternative explanation why the rebound looks so much more frothy than the first bubble?)<br><br>Finally, in order to form a bow shock in front of a moving projectile in a fluid, the projectile must be traveling greater than the velocity of sound in that fluid.  I don&#39;t know what the muzzle velocity of an AK47 is, but I doubt very much it&#39;s any where near the speed of sound in water (about 5 x the velocity in air), and even more so, especially after it has been slowed down tremendously by the water.  <br><br>But I don&#39;t mean to take anything from this very interesting and well made video, and it was a welcomed surprise to see someone talking real Physics on a YouTube channel.  I look forward to more videos.

While working in the factory their closest man on the floor was Mikhail Kalashnikov. After 7 years of work Hugo and his team were released. Hugo died in his home in 1953.<br><br>A Russian Weapon speciallist and scientist named Anton Kalmikov are openly critical and says: &quot;It is completley absurd to believe that a Russian engineer could have developed the AK47. Because such a design requires a highly advanced engineering expretise that the Soviet simply did not posess during that time&quot;.<br><br>Hugo Schmeisser and his team will not recieve any recognition for the development of the AK47. But that isn&#39;t strange at all. No nation would give an enemy POW creds for such an iconic invetion so Mikhail was given the honor. But fact still remains: The AK47 is essentially a German Developed weapon. And it comes as no purprise when come to think of it. It is known to never fail, which is typical of German Quality. Unlike Russian quality that is known to break down by itself. Like what Nicolas Cage says in the movie &quot;Lord of War&quot;: &quot;Since the end of the Cold War the Kalashnikov has become the Russian peoples greatest export...one thing was sure, no one was lining up to buy their cars&quot;.

Which implies we are still in the subsonic regime (M ~ 0.5). Two interesting things to note<br><br>1) We cannot claim the bullet is enclosed in the clearer second bubble and the shockwave is inside the bubble. This is possible because speed of sound in water vapor is sqrt(g RT) ~ 400 m/s. It is clearly seen from the video that the cavitation happens in the middle of the bubble in the streamwise direction.<br><br>2) It could be that the bullet is travelling at what aerodynamicists call critical mach number which means at some point on the bullet, the flow is sonic and a normal shock appears. If that is the case I would expect the bubble formed on the bullet to have a sharp interface.<br><br>So think the cavitation effect on the bullet is due to pressure reduction from higher fluid speeds on its surface. The initial bubble from the barrel is complicated because of cavitation of water from the inside the barrel and the turbulence generated by the bullet. Viscous and pressure drag slows down the bullet towards the end to creates a simpler bubble profile, which may not have to do with shockwaves at all.", "comment_date": "2015-08-02T16:22:50Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "DJay_Shady", "comment_text": "tht why u pick up an ak over an m4... like if you get the joke...", "comment_date": "2015-08-02T05:03:58Z", "likes_count": 2}, {"comment_by": "Raven Soren", "comment_text": "It shrinks down twice.

I think the explosive force/gases are actually leaking around the bullet and shoving the water out of the way. The initial cloud like blast out of the muzzle is the leaked gases that will travel much faster than the bullet. But than we see the dark powder residue following the bullet and the bullet traversing the hollow vacuum bubble to burst through and create its own vacuum bubble.<br>I think these funny looking bubbles are almost pure vacuum with the first cloud like bubble having some minute gasses that rapidly cool. The bullet will leave a pure vacuum at those temps. There should be no steam creation at those temps even from pure vacuum.\u00a0<br>The pulsation phenomenon is pretty cool. Water ram pumps are built on this principle and water piping installed improperly in a house can rattle from this same principle that has to do with mass and momentum. Momentum created from such a large vacuum collapsing is going to create a rediculous amount of force on the water. It acts like its bouncing on itself but the force is so great it creates a massive High pressure in a very teeny tiny area. Whether it actually creates a tiny steam explosion or just bounces back would make for some interesting tests.\u00a0<br>One extra test I would have liked to have seen would have been filling the barrel in front of the bullet with a dark blue or red dye. Hold it in there with a bit of tissue and filming that blast so as to better see where and how far that water goes.\u00a0<br>Cool experiments!
