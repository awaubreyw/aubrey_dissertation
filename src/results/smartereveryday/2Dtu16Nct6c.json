There were a couple of clips that really stood out in Mark&#39;s video due their sharpness, as well as it didn&#39;t seem as though the spinning mirror effect was being used at all. Like, they were done with the camera on a tripod aimed at the subject like normal.

Basically instead of surrounding the subject with cameras, or using a spinning mirror. What if we had a reflective surface that surrounded the subject. Instinctively I\u2019m thinking a mirrored surface donut, but maybe there are more optimal shapes. If you put the subject in the middle of the shiny donut, and put the camera below, I reckon the camera can see the subject from all sides. Of course it will be very distorted, but each frame has enough data in it to have a 360 image.
