[{"comment_by": "SmarterEveryDay", "comment_text": "This video was the opportunity of a lifetime. When asked if I wanted to fly in an F-16, I said &quot;Yes please, and there are some things I&#39;d like to study. Can we try supersonic flight at different altitudes?&quot; I&#39;m very grateful for this opportunity and would like to thank Flack and the rest of the US Air Force Thunderbirds.  This flight took place on May 3rd, 2019.  This Spatial Disorientation training is something all fighter pilots go through so they can understand how their own physiology works under these conditions.  <br>Thank you for watching and learning with me.  I always wanted to know what happened in the cockpit when a jet goes supersonic.

That&#39;s God stating it in that verse and there are more verses. People need to repent, to be cleansed by His blood and live Holy because He&#39;s Holy and righteous because He&#39;s righteous. Our God said to stop sinning in many many scriptures and He paid for everyone to be cleansed of sin (Isaiah 53), and to live how He said. He dwells in the Holy temple (your body) and said not to defile the temple. He said to defile the temple is death. He&#39;s always serious about everything He said to do. He&#39;s just as serious about what He said not to do. We live in obedience to His law, every word if it!

The whole chapter, and verse 46 is one example of generational curses. These go into the following generations, the 3 and 4th. Our children pay the price for our sin. Stop sinning you are sending consequences to yourself and to your loved ones, children. By God&#39;s law you are. If you don&#39;t believe me ask Him, in Jesus name may you see and know the truth in it&#39;s fullness. <br>Love your neighbor as you love yourself.\u00a0<br><br>Jesus is worthy of everything He said and paid for, so I implore you to do as God said.<br>Jesus said If you love me you will obey my commands.

I\u2019d seen the T-Birds before from a distance but to see it all up close was surreal. The pre-flight check with the pilots and their personal crews was amazing- I still get goosebumps thinking about it.  My FAVORITE maneuver was 1-4 in Diamond coming in from the east in a slow roll. Everyone\u2019s attention was that direction. 5 came from the west right over the tarmac at about 200 ft and about .7 Mach and the burner cooking.

Mace addressed this when she spoke about \u201cacquired tolerance\u201d gained through repetition and training. We start out as children with an important and necessary deception called perception of invulnerability. As children, we walk around most of the time believing we cannot die. We have vastly unrealistic beliefs about our abilities and limits. My mother loves to tell the story of a 3-year-old me who would tell her that I could not be hit by a car while playing in the street, because I would lie on the ground and push the car in the air and make it pass over me. I truly believed this. As we age, experiences and gained knowledge begins to lessen our perception of invulnerability as reality sets in and we begin to truly learn our limits. However, most of us we never completely shed this mythological perception, and that is very important for us as a society to grow and create. People like Steve Jobs and Elon Musk have maintained a lot of their perception of invulnerability, supported and affirmed by their successes (when others tell them something is impossible). Their failures may lessen this invulnerability perception, but it doesn\u2019t erase it (thankfully). If everyone had an exactly perfect perception of their vulnerability, far fewer would ever attempt to achieve something beyond a consensus of what the crowd says is possible. This is augmented by dreams, aspirations and necessity, but the foundation is that critical perception of invulnerability. Before Mace ever sat in a cockpit, she had some perception that she would (or might) be invulnerable to G forces that most of us cannot withstand. Her successes affirmed this perception until she trained to make it her reality. Your experience in the F-16 denied your perception of invulnerability and you gained maturity and a wonderful new attitude about approaching new experiences and interactions with other people. You are now more aware of your limits and the reality that your perception of invulnerability can be wrong and cause you to act in ways that can hurt your relationships with others and hamper your ability to succeed. That is a real key (IMHO) to succeeding in life: the constant affirmation and denial of our perception of invulnerability, which teaches us our limits, but also causes us to strive to \u201cacquire tolerance\u201d so we can push beyond a previous limitation to grow, create and expand our horizons.", "comment_date": "2021-05-07T20:29:31Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Mohammed Almuraihel", "comment_text": "Loved this phenomenal experience.. this is like a dream for me.

I constantly have to depend on my vision, body position sensation and gravity sensation to determine which way is up.   I have to walk with a cane and/or drag my hand along a wall for a tactile reference to a fixed point in space. It is very taxing to the processing power of my brain - which has to continuously recompute which way is up - with no gyros to help.  This (vestibular) system also controls eye movement, which is why you had the nystagmus. When I walk, I see like an old jerky 8mm movie instead of a nice steadycam image. Seasickness is very common<br>.<br>Often, when I lose sight of visual references of the horizon or suddenly move my head, I fall over. I also get into what I call &quot;reverberation mode&quot; when I lose visual reference, especially in a closed in space, I start swaying around like a bird on a wire and can not stop even after regaining a visual reference. Fortunately, and this is not a joke, I drink a few shots of alcohol to get me out of that loop. When people drink alcohol, they get pretty much the same effect with their balance, coordination, and eye control I now have normally. In effect, I get anti-drunk, which steadies me up, probably by numbing my damaged system.<br><br>Science Project: <br>Next time you sit in that chair, try it again after a few shots.

Especially the first time you get punched in the face by them.  My first time hitting &gt;4 G&#39;s I thought I was going to die and at 6.7 G&#39;s, only 5 mins later, I had enough. I was flying with my Squadron Commander in Pensacola, FL (in fact we were around Dauphin Island as seen in your video here) and I had to tap out before we got to the &quot;fun stuff&quot; so I felt sooooo weak.  I definitely didn&#39;t recover in a few minutes either.  I was a wreck for the rest of the 30 min flight and even through the debrief I felt like I had just done 12 rounds in the boxing ring with someone roughly 6.7 times my weight class.  As for your experience, not only was this an incredibly cool opportunity (I as an Air Force Aviator only dream of getting a ride-along with the T-Birds), but you did really freaking well, man.  Most people would&#39;ve been tapping out on that departure alone.  Be proud of what you got to do, and how much you withstood... It was WELL above average.<br><br>Also, thank you for this.  I just showed my wife this because you put into a 30 min video a better explanation/representation of this kind of flying better than I could in hours/days of me trying to explain.

Ripple\u2019s partner, SBI, has teamed up with crypto exchange FXCoin and others to develop an XRP based solution that reduces volatility when sending remittances. Announced in April of this year, the solution is expected to be launched in a test format by the end of November.<br><br>FXCoin is a relatively new exchange. Its operations began in 2018, founded by former Deutsche Bank employees. However, only at the end of 2019 it received a license from the Japanese regulator, the Financial Services Agency, to operate as an exchange.<br><br>The solution the exchange develops with SBI will allow users to send remittances without worrying about market fluctuations, changes in exchange rates or any of the other problems associated with sending remittances. The solution will be specially focused to be a tool that can be used by companies in Japan in need to send large amounts of money abroad. Senior strategist at FXCoin, Yasuo Matsuda said:<br><br>Until now, active crypto has been used mainly for speculative purposes due to the magnitude of price movements\u2026<br><br>To establish the exchange market and expand the use for real demand, we will proceed with the demonstration experiment of domestic remittances and remittances abroad through the XRP, and finally, global cash management, corporate finance and trade.<br><br>Will the adoption of XRP increase?<br>The solution developed by FXCoin, SBI, and its partners responds to an internal demand for crypto-based products. According to the local Nikkei media report, many companies in Japan have stayed away from crypto payment solutions because of the risks associated with this asset class. Volatility is the main detractor.<br><br>Apparently, FXCoin has the support of a number of companies that have committed to using the solution, if the test phase is successful. That way, there could be an increase in the adoption of XRP and a positive impact on its performance in 2021.<br><br>As reported by CNF, FXCoin announced in late July the launch of an XRP based exchange to protect its users from sudden price fluctuations. At that time, it became known that SBI Holdings made an investment in the exchange.<br><br>SBI Holdings is one of Ripple\u2019s biggest supporters in Asia. Yoshitaka Kitao, CEO of SBI Holdings, is considered a key player in the partnership between the financial institution and the payment solutions company. Kitao is part of Ripple\u2019s board of directors.

This left me with pronounced nystagmus (like you were having in the chair) and constant vertigo.  They initially though I&#39;d had a stroke (and i had to get the shots in the stomach, they didn&#39;t hurt much but left a belt of purple bruises around my waist) but stroke was completely ruled out and the diagnosis was a viral infection in my vestibular system (didn&#39;t hurt, oddly enough).  Long story short, I went through months of neuro physical therapy to get to where I could even go to the bathroom by myself (and not fall on the whole 15 foot trip), and after what is now closing on 2 years I can drive - carefully.  I still fall from time to time, especially when I turn too quickly to the right, but it&#39;s something I have to live with now.

For instance, you\u2019re looking out the left and pilot suddenly rolls the airplane right.. Tumbles my gyros every time.  However, when I have control of the aircraft that queasy feeling immediately goes away and I can make those high G turns, roll it, split-S, and other maneuvers without getting sick because I know what to expect.   And, flying those kind of high performance aircraft with the great operational latitude as far as airspeed, G\u2019s, climb and decent rates, and awesome almost limitless power they are like flying my PA-28-235 with power steering, titanium wings, and super charging...

The reason you think it&#39;s lower speed at higher altitude is only because the temperature was lower not because you were higher AGL or lower air density.    Regarding handling G force, Aerobatic pilots are Amazing what they can tolerate.  They build-up tolerance and lose it if they stop for a while.  Personally, I was right with you when you tapped out and I was not in the jet.  You would probably love to do a show on Felix or Aaron with Red Bull flying upside down in the BO-105 helicopter.

Humble and totally capable . Women have more than they think they do , Mace figured it out . Yet she still maintains a humble attitude because she knows it&#39;s all about training , practice and continued education .  I hope other young women will be inspired and realize they too , will never know unless they bust through their own sound barriers  . Mahalo to all who participated in making this incredible documentary on human flight characteristics . I used to watch the Blue Angels practice at Pensacola when I was there for training , it&#39;s an amazing thing to watch , I am a A/P Mech. and  have over 10,000 hours in Fixed wing and Rotor so I can totally appreciate this . <br>Thanks Again .....

By that, I mean you were flying around in &quot;PNEU&quot; pneumatic rather than &quot;ELEC&quot; electric selected.  PNEU is that backup mode that provides raw data rather than corrected data.

I&#39;m sure you&#39;re also aware of all the corrections and limitations that need to be accounted due to the basic design of altimeters. That is one reason the altimeter wouldn&#39;t be as smooth as it should be during flight, but more importantly, it is not sharing data with the CADC or central air data computer.  The CADC will account for all atmospherics during flight as it needs to provide very accurate info to a number of systems within the F-16 (or any jet with a CADC).  In PNEU it will jump around and not be smooth whereas once you select ELEC (small switch on the bottom right of the altimeter), it will smooth right out and provide more stable and accurate data.  If you had been in ELEC, I don&#39;t think the altimeter would have jumped more than about 50&#39;.  At least that is my experience in the F-16 as well as a number of other fighters I&#39;ve flown.  Also because the flight control system is always correcting to 1G flight, you won&#39;t feel or see when &quot;Mach Tuck&quot; occurs like it does in aircraft without an active flight control system. I do like how you give the background on the aerodynamics that are occurring during flight.

The fly by wire computer detects how much movement you want by mesuring the strengh you put in  the stick. I&#39;ve never flown the F-16 but I love this aircraft since I was a kid. I fly the Airbus 320/321 and it shares the same principals with the F-16, but we have a free sidestick.

I am not sure about the F16 in particular, but i know that pitot tubes are only used to measure pressure differential (deltaP) i.e. airspeed. And for altimetry (purely analog or otherwise) there is a dedicated one or more static ports, that give altitude reading after a mechanical correction for pressure. In the case of modern airliners, there are usualy three static ports going to an air data computer that compares the readings constantly (in the case of a malfunction, port blockage etc.) also adding a correction for local pressure, temperature and hunidity. Anyhow i am not a physicist, nor i am familiar with the F16 fighter aircraft and its instruments and the explanation for the altimeter jump is 100% correct, because it is a pressure jump as the aircraft hardly lost or gained any significant altitude while breaking the sound barrier.

Its been a chance to experience some of these aeronautical concepts first hand.  4 G maneuvers, inverted flight, spins, stalls, etc. (glider aerobatics are a fascinating application of energy conservation), but It only scratches the surface.  I doubt I&#39;ll be going supersonic in a glider anytime soon.  I love flight science and for me, getting to fly is a way to understand it from the inside out.  I often tell other pilots, I want to understand flight from both sides of the drawing board.  I sincerely hope one of these days I&#39;m able to have an opportunity myself to ride second seat in jet fighter.  We&#39;ll see!  <br>Thanks again!", "comment_date": "2020-05-29T06:29:45Z", "likes_count": 23}, {"comment_by": "Ahmed Eltuorky", "comment_text": "\u2665Can I make a subscription to the channel?", "comment_date": "2020-05-29T06:06:27Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Muhammad Rashaad", "comment_text": "Home Sweet Alabama", "comment_date": "2020-05-29T06:05:56Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Jose santos Sanchez gonzales", "comment_text": "A  180 turn takes about two seconds the most.Well,my turns at least.", "comment_date": "2020-05-29T05:56:12Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "SwAvy btw", "comment_text": "And this is y this is my dream job", "comment_date": "2020-05-29T05:28:07Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Jack Jones", "comment_text": "Imagine the pilots who flew with them years ago before fly by wire and heads up display when it was that much more difficult to perform those routines!", "comment_date": "2020-05-29T05:21:56Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Punisher", "comment_text": "Man, I am a fun of your work!

In 1979 there were three unexplained CFIT (Controlled Flight Into Terrain) crashes and the entire fleet was grounded. I knew the problem and independently came up with a solution. After many months to locate just the person to discuss the solution, I spoke with Lt Col Kramer at Wright Patterson AFB for about an hour to provide information for the PGCAS - Preventative Ground Collision Avoidance System. At the time, 25 of our nation&#39;s best were sequestered working on the solution, and Lt Col Kramer was very appreciative of my input. Since F-18 pilots brag they can exceed human limits using the system, and confirming the project is declassified, though I never will or have discussed the technology, I now can speak of my involvement in the success of the F-16 Falcon!! I have tried to find someone to authorize that I can go for a ride. If anyone knows where and how this can be accomplished, please let me know. I have delayed considering to have a ride due to injuries from a car crash, but have recovered well enough to enjoy the flight!! So, if anyone can have someone contact me so I can have a ride in the magnificent F-16, please have them contact me. I have talked with Col Lawhead at the pentagon and verified my involvement. Col Lawhead was surprised I had such information on a black project (I have the information because I lived it), but could not help me to schedule a ride. I contacted President Trump also, with no success. After 40 years, I think I have earned the privilege of a ride. I was in discussion to make arrangements for a ride some 35 years ago, but a crash of an F-7 with a civilian passenger caused a mandate to not have civilians as passengers for decades. That mandate has been rescinded. I hope to have my dream fulfilled before I die.

Over the years I have been privileged to meet scores of Special Forces Operators representing all branches of our military and a few from other countries. These men all tend to have a very high degree of modesty and they are surprisingly grounded in humility. This is not at all the what most people would expect.<br>These people, like the men and woman you experienced have a tremendous degree of responsibility, knowledge and expertise in their chosen  field, and yet they\u2019re blessed with the gift of modesty. They don\u2019t come across as loud boasters or egomaniacal divas. And I believe that at the core of this trait lies their observation of those who came before them. Not humility via tradition alone but an actual transformation in the DNA of their perceived self. Of course there will always be a bad nut in the batch but those people tend to get weeded out by attrition or fail in the early stages of training by the group. This is not an absolute guarantee however. <br>Another reason may be their understanding of the distinct position they hold. They appreciate their unique position in that their are only small numbers of people that pass through training and are employed in their field. This brings about a bond among them which is where humility is an established trait among their peers.

She explained how it is basically a physical effect that effects your inner ear to make you feel disoriented. For me it sounded like this would happen for every human and even though not every human is like one another, this effect must also occur for jet pilots. So is there a explanation how these pilots over come this effect. Is there brain getting used to the effect, that the inner ear gives misleading information, are there other senses which can correct some of those information? <br>I would like to here your thoughts on that.

But if I make that choice I knew what was coming and I can stop when I feel uncomfortable. I know Destin couldn&#39;t do this test with him flying it.

I live just across the water. The flyover was dedicated to the nurses and doctors fighting this whole thing. I was looking out for them but could only hear them. Other people saw them but I didn&#39;t catch them in time. Anyways, this is one of my dreams, to fly in a fighter jet or any jet for that matter.

I respect these pilots for pushing human capability to the edge. But there is a different kind of respect and admiration I have for the post of world war 2, they where pulling high Gs when diving on each other and the entire time they are managing their plane as they have no fancy computer systems to do it for them.

Starting right NOW -- hydrate. Drink more water than you normally do\u2026 then drink some more. Hydration combats motion sickness, so this step is key. Please do this only until the evening to avoid the need to use the restroom every few hours during the night, as sleep is important as well. Try to get a good night&#39;s rest -- at least 7 hours if possible.  The day of your flight, we want you to have food in your stomach, but nothing greasy and nothing spicy. I&#39;d recommend fruit, bread, bagels, oatmeal, light sandwiches, or (my personal favorite) peanut butter and banana toast. Please also bring some kind of light snack in case your flight is delayed. The day of the flight, minimize caffeine and carbonation.

So every move I make is amplified by those flakes, all day every day. It&#39;s often referred to as benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV). The way the lady in your video explained it was SPOT ON and the best explanation I have ever seen. Sadly it can&#39;t be fixed through a medical procedure but I can subdue the effect through medication, bottom line is I will never be able to perform any activities anymore which require me to tumble around or be upside down or anything.

It relies on sensors that detect the pressures exerted on the stick by the pilot, while the stick remains fairly static (it used to be completely static, but they added about 1/4&quot; movement as seen in the video, to help pilots differentiate roll vs pitch inputs, and also because pilots were adding too much input to the point the planes would return to the hangar with bent sticks!).

It was like  Mounting a lazy Boy recliner into the ejection seat only the back did not reclione but rather the seat itself raised up.

Visual cues are probably the 2nd most important. But also nerve ending inputs from the hairs on your face, arms, lets, etc, all get incorporated. It will also use the feedback from muscular nerves on what they are having to do to maintain body position. Most of the time, all of these inputs agree with each other. That&#39;s why the chair was so confusing... your inner ear was telling your brain one thing (the primary input) but all the other inputs were saying something different. High gs does that too as it puts an external force on your muscular system, reported by the nerves back to the brain as being in a certain direction, but your eyes are saying you aren&#39;t moving relative to the plane, yet your inner ear is saying you are definitely moving. It&#39;s conflicting signals.<br>Which is why Mace can be so humble about 9g... it is an acquired skill. Not everyone can do it, but you can train your brain, through repetition, to disregard conflicting inputs, or minimize them. Like learning a language, or a chef who can rapid chop food without worrying about cutting their fingers off... they have created, through repetition and practice, connections in their brain that handle the inputs and expected outputs. So now her brain knows to disregard the signal from her inner ear and rely more heavily on visual and other inputs when she is in the jet. Her brain will even begin to use the inputs from the aircraft systems themselves.<br>They did an experiment once in which they had people wear a belt that had rumble packs all around it, and the one that was facing north would vibrate. They wore them for a few weeks. In that time, most of the people&#39;s brains integrated the sensory input as a new &quot;sense.&quot; An innate sense of direction. The brain is really good at matching up data and so would take visual cues and pair them up with this new information. After the few weeks they took the belts off to see what would happen. Most of the people reported continuing to have a very intuitive sense of direction. A few reported even still being able to feel the vibration in the proper place as they turned. IE the brain was supplying to inferred feedback from the rumble pack as a phantom sensory input to match the other sensory data it did have. The brain is unbelievably good at this sort of thing. It&#39;s how you can drive home from work and when you pull in you stop and try to remember stopping at red lights... but you can&#39;t. You know you must have, but you can&#39;t remember it. Your brain just handled it for you in the background without interrupting you. It saw nothing out of the ordinary so the built up pathways just did their thing. You slowed the car, stopped, watched for the green, all while your conscious thought processes were free to think about other things, or sing Taylor Swift at full volume. This is sometimes called rote learning.<br>Sorry for the novel, but this ability of the brain fascinates me, and it applies to everything we do as humans. It&#39;s one of the keys to our rise to the top of the food/evolution pyramid on Earth. Anyway, I&#39;m super jealous of your chance to fly with the Falcons. I, like you, would love to think I got this. I&#39;ve flown 10s of thousands of hours in flight simulators since I was 6 years old. I&#39;ve played fighter games, etc. I majored in astrophysics so the math makes perfect sense. I know how planes work, etc. But I also know that knowing, and feeling directly are not the same thing. So no shame at all in tapping out. 9gs is no joke. Even on paper.

In front of the first shockwave is free stream static pressure and it jumps when moving through the wave. <br>Then the static pressure mostly remains the same until the next shockwave (or prandtl-meyer-expansion fan). What i though was going on is that the static pressure holes are behind 1 shockwave (generated by the cone&#39;s deflection of the air) and 1 expansion fan (created by the transition into a cylinder after the cone in front). <br>During a transition through a shockwave, total pressure is lost,  and therefore, after you &quot;re-expand&quot; the flow back to parallel to the free stream, your static (and dynamic) pressure will be lower than free stream values. <br>The drop in pressure right when going through the sound barrier i though had something to do with relatively huge losses in total pressure due to bow shock. This occurs because supersonic streams have a maximum deflection angle for oblique shockwaves (the ones you showed in the Schlieren image). If you exceed this angle (and that angle increases with Mach number, M1.1 gives you about 1,8\u00b0 theoretical max deflection while M2 can reach 23\u00b0),  bow shock will occur. This isnt an oblique shockwave and will sharply increase air restistance and total pressure loss. Once you move through that, oblique shockwaves will form and reduce restistance and pressure loss.", "comment_date": "2020-05-19T12:25:44Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Pognakvuth Meth", "comment_text": "This video is 30mins long and it went by like nothing", "comment_date": "2020-05-19T12:25:35Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Abu Bakr", "comment_text": "<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1PgNbgWSyY&amp;t=17m15s\">17:15</a> look outside behind the plane", "comment_date": "2020-05-19T12:25:04Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Crusade Against Tomatoes", "comment_text": "I love that you wrote what the vapor was, quality stuff!", "comment_date": "2020-05-19T12:22:58Z", "likes_count": 20}, {"comment_by": "kevin self", "comment_text": "Dude you live in mobile.

If you don&#39;t have a good nights sleep and hydrate, you are toast. It can actually make the difference between you feeling ok and wanted to tap out. Could actually be why 7.2 ended up making Destin tap out. That extra bit of sleep could have done it right there.  Your flight actually starts the day before, eating properly and getting good solid sleep. You may think you&#39;ll be fine if you didn&#39;t sleep a solid 7+ hours straight, you&#39;ll wake up fine, excited, feeling normal... When it comes time to be in the cockpit doing maneuvers and becoming task saturated, you&#39;ll be wishing you got extra hours of sleep. Hydration is another one, you will feel the difference if you do not follow these rules, people always think it&#39;s not that big of a deal, but you&#39;ll think it is by the end of your flight lol. Now this was a ride-along flight for Destin, which is different than learning to fly and going through multiple procedures, just imagine what it&#39;s like when you have tons of training to accomplish, remembering training, learning new tasks, etc... Flying isn&#39;t easy even at 1.5G. I&#39;m glad to see someone talk about the inner ear issues as well, a simple head turn during a maneuver can ruin your day. Happened to me on one of my first flight lessons, my flight instructor had taken over the controls to start landing and in that single moment my inner ear went nuts.

We didn&#39;t go supersonic, something about scaring the people and breaking windows over CONUS. We maxed out at .98 mach but we did pull 9.2g and I got the pin to prove it. 9.2g is physically painful. I had my hands on my thighs and couldn&#39;t lift them. You are right, it is the opportunity of a lifetime, I would do it again in a heartbeat.<br><br><br>When you woke up the next day were you sore? I could barely walk I hurt so bad. I got to see my pilot 2 days later and he said &quot;I didn&#39;t do very well if you could get out of bed the next day&quot;. It wore me out and I was used to being worn out working on the fire dept. And the drive home, going 80 was like standing still. I couldn&#39;t drive, I would have been going 150. <br><br><br>Sitting in the back seat as we passed over the end of the runway I had to lean forward a bit to see my family on the ground passing at 400 miles an hour. When we pulled up the g put my head between my knees and there was nothing I could do to move it until the g let off going vertical. <br><br><br>The g practice we pulled 7 and I was ok. First your vision goes blurry like looking through a fish bowl. Pulling 9g was an entirely different experience. Everything got fuzzy, then I lost the colors, everything was black and white. I remember my pilot calling out 8 and then the edges started closing in on me. Blackness started at the edges and rapidly moved toward the middle. Just before the g let off it was like looking through a paper towel roll, at a fishbowl, in black and white. I was probably within a couple of seconds of gLOC. <br><br><br>It was amazing and I am happy you got to do it as well. <br><br><br>Full disclosure, I did puke. Twice. Once after the 9g pull and once under negative g. We had done an aileron roll vertically from 12,000 up to 40,000 feet and the pilot wanted to get back down low into the thick air to do some maneuvers and he pointed the nose down and goosed the throttle and we dropped fast back to 12,000. Negative g puts your stomach in your throat and we had held it for a minute or longer. That made me lose lunch. But a flip of the O2 switch back behind the left side of the seat and I was ready for more. It all went by so fast, we flew for almost an hour and it seemed like 15 minutes. <br><br><br>You should look into flying with the Blue Angels so you can compare and contrast the experiences, I am sure they would be happy to take you along and wear you out too.<br><br><br>And the walk to the plane was slow motion. I actually arrived at the airport before the planes and had to sit inside the ready room listening to them do their passes to mark landmarks for the airshow that weekend. Only 7 of the planes made it, the one I was supposed to fly in had a problem and was delayed waiting for a part to arrive.

Yes, this does mean that sound speed will be a bit slower at higher altitude because the air is a bit colder, but the vast, vast majority of the difference in calibrated airspeed between your 20,000 foot M1 run and 30,000 foot M1 run is purely due to the density difference. <br><br>I don&#39;t know what the external temperatures were for you on that day, but using the standard atmosphere as a reference, at 20,000 feet, we would expect an external temperature of -24.6C, leading to a sound speed of 316 m/s (614 knots), while at 30,000 feet, we would expect -44.4C external temperature and a sound speed of 303 m/s (589 knots). Note that both of these are far greater than your indicated 491 and 392 knots, and also much closer together - this is because calibrated airspeed is more a measure of dynamic pressure than it is actually a measurement of speed.<br><br>Calibrated airspeed is basically telling you the speed which you would have to go at sea level to get the same dynamic pressure as you are currently experiencing. This means that at sea level, it&#39;s very close to correct, but up at 40,000 feet, where density is 1/4 of sea level, your calibrated airspeed will be ~half of what your true airspeed is.<br><br>This of course is a very useful measurement when flying, since it tells you a lot about what your acceptable load factors are, how close you are to stalling, etc, but it is fairly useless when talking about how sound speed varies with altitude, since CAS varies far more with altitude than sound speed does. <br><br>I would imagine you&#39;re already familiar with this, given your clearly well-loved copy of Anderson&#39;s Fundamentals of Aerodynamics that you show at the beginning, but in the video, this seemed very unclear to me (and it is a common misconception that sound speed depends on density or pressure of air, when in reality temperature is the only relevant variable, at least for conditions where it approximates an ideal gas). <br><br>(I&#39;m also glossing over a few of the complications of calibrated airspeed here, since really what I&#39;m describing above is closer to indicated airspeed rather than calibrated, but that doesn&#39;t really matter for my point here)", "comment_date": "2020-05-19T00:20:43Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Bj\u00f6rn Fahller", "comment_text": "I flew +6,5g and -3g in one 10 minutes flight.

Your ear has tiny calcium crystals called otoliths that float in the fluid in the utricles that stimulate cilia which connect to nerves and is how your vestibule system provides proprioception. Spinning around like that causes the otoliths to slosh through the fluid hard enough that they keep moving for a little while after you&#39;ve stopped, causing your brain to think you&#39;re still moving, and thus move your eyes to try to gain a fix on the world. You probably felt dizzy and nauseous.

Getting to fly with The Thunderbirds must have been a treat. I&#39;d like to go up in an F-16 as well as experiencing a carrier deck launch.

(My house is trying to kill me.)<br><br><br>There&#39;s all sorts of things to unpack from this video, but one thing you glossed over that I found really interesting with modern fighter craft: The nimbleness. You mentioned the aircraft&#39;s response, but what a lot of people don&#39;t know is that it comes at the cost of stability.  Think of Speed, Agility, and Stability the three corners to an aircraft&#39;s aerodynamic design. You can increase one corner of the pyramid, but you pay for it by one or both of the other sides. Commercial aircraft (like the Boeing 7X7 series or the Airbus A3XX series) focus on speed and stability over agility. This means those aircraft have a wide flight profile before you&#39;ve exceeded the characteristics of the plane and it loses lift and drops from the sky. This also means that they tend to maneuver like a lead duck. Fighter jets are actually described as &quot;aerodynamically unstable&quot;. They favor speed and agility by sacrificing stability. They have a very narrow flight envelope that will quickly turn that plane into the world&#39;s fastest brick. This is common among all modern jet fighters, but planes like the F-111 were especially known for this. To counter this, they rely on fly by wire systems to take the pilot&#39;s input and adjust the flight control surfaces to keep the aircraft within it&#39;s flight envelope.
