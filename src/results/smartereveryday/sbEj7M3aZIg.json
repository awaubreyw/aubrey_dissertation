The points where I disagree are: 1. Don&#39;t shoot down the innovators.  If someone can make your process more efficient, don&#39;t shame them, listen to them.  Study their variations and see if it can streamline the whole process.  Just like when using injection molding, spending a little more time up front with R&amp;D can create a better product more efficiently.  2. As others have said, fans aren&#39;t the best solution for drying the products.  Especially without filters.  If you added a ducted HEPA filter, that would at least catch some contaminants.  Not a coronavirus but, other contaminants floating around.  As I said, overall a great video (as usual).", "comment_date": "2022-01-28T03:14:37Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Misc Mitz", "comment_text": "Hey, not trying to be a jerk but I have a related question.

I don&#39;t know why, but this always makes me tear up! I think it&#39;s because there is so much divisiveness in the world today. People are so quick to hate and judge those who are different from them. Fear takes over and they jump to conclusions without questioning their own logic or reasoning. It&#39;s hard to be truly empathetic. It&#39;s hard to have your perspective challenged. It&#39;s hard to see things from a different point of view, especially when you are afraid. I think a lot of people are afraid right now and the instinct is to protect yourself and your loved ones, forsaking all others. That&#39;s why I&#39;m so encouraged by people who go against their primal instincts and overcome their differences to come together for a cause that&#39;s bigger than them... Difficult times bring out the best, AND the worst in people. It really separates the wheat from the chaff.

I think it might be a good teaching moment to use that to show people visually exactly how wearing a mask stops the spread and keeps it in your personal space. Something I don&#39;t think anyone else has done yet. Sadly, people need to be shown at that level of depth why a mask works, because some are refusing so hard right now, not understanding how a fabric in front of your face does anything. I&#39;ve seen people just wear it on their mouth and not even over their nose! Just saw a video of someone who cut out a slot right in the middle... I am just flabbergasted at people&#39;s constant ability to surprise by their display of inability to properly do something so simple... Can you help people out there understand even further how effective different types of masks are?", "comment_date": "2020-05-03T21:29:03Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "John Alexis De Jesus", "comment_text": "there something i need to show and i want to know the science behind. it help cough out and it my help others to", "comment_date": "2020-05-03T11:19:43Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Emeth0", "comment_text": "<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sbEj7M3aZIg&amp;t=02m50s\">02:50</a> Plants vs zombies, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sbEj7M3aZIg&amp;t=3m50s\">3:50</a> i saw umbrella corp", "comment_date": "2020-05-02T10:36:27Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Douglas Scroggs", "comment_text": "I went to the hospital .

This is how we solved it: <br><br>1. We created a FB group through which we informed people what we started doing, calling them to join the action.. Fast enough the group has grown 20k. <br>2. We created a Slack communication, putting 3 well informed doctors at the top of the communication. They must confirm the choice of materials and all design changes etc. <br>3. We transferred the interested people to the Slack communication and included them in the process. Created channels on Slack for helping of those who have a setup problems etc. <br>4. Bunch of volunteers connected to help the action, few people responsible for distribution organize them to collect the printed frames, distribute materials to the printers and help with the disinfection - supervised by some of the doctors. <br>5. Then the same guys help with the distribution of the prepared shield to the medical institutions. <br><br>- We improved the production (speed and quality), we changed the original Prusa model (removed the logo to speed-up - we needed to! , changed the hooks for the transparent shield - people were breaking the frames trying to assemble it , I made a video about how easy it is to assemble it now...). <br>- This works for the last 15 days! So far we have delivered (donated! ) thousands of shields and still going every day better that yesterday... <br><br>Thanks for all of those who are helping somehow.

Face masks are disposable equipment and are meant to fit more universally.  Rigid 3D printed and injection molded headbands do not fit universally and are much too costly to make.  I have a 3D printer and have used injection molding in medical prototypes.  You&#39;re wasting too much time.  The ones we have used for years have a sponge headband and velcro straps.  They are cost effective and are a throw away item.  Face shields are not meant to be sterile equipment, so better check with the local hospital as to your cleaning solutions so that it can be used in their hospital without causing contact allergies.  When one has a 3D printer one&#39;s solution is to 3D print the solution.  Much like having a hammer and everything looks like a nail.  3D printing is much too time consuming and costly for this solution.  And you would have to make too many different sizes to fit to each head shape.  A gap in the fit is not good.  Foam is much more economical and fits any size and contour head, man or woman.  It is much more comfortable, and cheap enough to just toss like disposable gloves.   Why change what has been working well for decades. You are overthinking the solution.  Your time may be better spent getting the public to wear surgical face masks when outside of the house.  Huntsville has shot up to 165 cases today, so more needs to be done to inform the public so that the front line medical staff doesn&#39;t need to be seeing too many of them.", "comment_date": "2020-04-09T04:49:13Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Ibnu Wicak Danurdara", "comment_text": "I think LAMINAR FLOW air chamber reduce virus contamination", "comment_date": "2020-04-09T04:41:21Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Daren", "comment_text": "I&#39;m Canadian.

You think everyone that has a 3D printer should be printing and only printing.  First of all, you have no idea what you are talking about.  It takes someone with 3D printer knowledge and experience to make improvements that accomplish the overall objective.  So, modifying printer settings to speed up the production rate is something that also needs to be done.  But, with your limited knowledge, you think it is better to just repeat inefficiency for the sake of production -- the blind leading the blind.  You are best served in a position where you can repeat the same process over and over again, without innovation.  Luckily, you had help, from an expert, pointing out what to do and how to sanitize the mask.  Your opinion about &quot;everyone with a 3D printer just needs to print masks&quot; -- false.  There is a place for someone &quot;to be that guy,&quot; and yes, that guy is THE EXPERT in 3D Printing.  Engineers are experts in 3D modelling and nobody should get in the way while some organizers  also need to take advice from experts to get things done faster, easier.   Huntsville has a boat-load of Engineers with know-how.  Any managers think they know everything about who should do what, in haste, but will find themselves in the firey pits for their mistakes.

Economy. My business is almost completely shut down. And the reason it&#39;s shut down is mainly because of people and their fear. The economy is shut down because of fear. We don&#39;t need to shut down. Covid is less harmful than the ecomony being shutdown. People are going to die either way but people don&#39;t need to lose their income and businesses. Even if 1 million people die in America that&#39;s still less than 1% of the US population, it&#39;s about 0.3%. Yet the job loss is sitting around 25% give or take right now. Whether that be people losing their business or people just losing their jobs because of the government shut down. This percent is far greater than the loss of life. Loss of job and business affects so much more than just life. In fact it even affects the loss of life in different ways. I think we are &quot;sacrificing&quot; for the wrong reasons. The greater sacrifice would be to lose your life or at least risk the loss of it to help other maintain their quality of life and peace of mind. This virus is fueled by the biggest propaganda campaign I have ever seen in my lifetime. Nobody cares about me, nobody cares about the ones that are really suffering right now. I&#39;m not saying to not help make parts but I&#39;m saying we need a balance. We can&#39;t let our systems fail, our systems require a balance of each system, when one collapses they all will eventually collapse. People freak when the talk of death comes out but to be honest I could list off so many more things people die from in greater numbers in a year than they ever will by Covid. We are overreacting and in turn causing more harm than people care about. I&#39;d like to see you take charge and use your platform to inform people of the truth, but I&#39;m not sure you can even do that.

In my village we have a neighbourhood grocery shopping service (which is great, but I also cannot do much there, since I can&#39;t drive grocery shopping), but any more seems inefficient to have in a village of maybe 800 people \u2013 there are just not enough volunteers, maybe one 3d printer (if I&#39;m lucky) and no hospitals needing equipment... So if you have any ideas how I can help as a student stuck at home, I&#39;d appreciate it a lot!", "comment_date": "2020-04-07T21:03:58Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Buckley Wiley", "comment_text": "I currently have 4 printers printing out these masks", "comment_date": "2020-04-07T21:02:05Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Igor Georgievski", "comment_text": "SouthEastern Europe here.

I am extremely frustrated with what I see going on and I don&#39;t know who to talk to or what to do about it. <br><br><br><br>I work for an electrical company. I was on one of our commercial work sites today with a lot of other &quot;essential&quot; workers but nothing we are doing there is essential. (We are building a several new warehouses on this particular site.) The vast majority of our jobs are not essential. But because a small fraction of the jobs we do are essential there are no provisions for our companies to send people home. We are all still taking whatever work we can find, which is mostly not essential stuff. There are a bunch of different trades still working on the same site as well. I imagine many other commercial construction sites are still open as well. <br><br><br><br>So we are definitely undermining everyone&#39;s efforts to maintain separation and social distancing by going into people&#39;s houses and businesses for tons of trivial jobs. On our commercial sites there is no realistic way to maintain social distancing, and we constantly share tools, equipment, and machinery to get our jobs done.

ORDERLY communication and networks/systems to give everyone a honest say, as Destin admitted some people do have real quality input. Do not just fall in line like a slave. Think, add, build. If you can increase supply chain effiency or product quality, while sticking to the plan, get involved in a orderly fashion to discuss, agree on, and implement the improvement. <br><br>We live in a democracy over a dictatorship for a reason. It works better. In the short term the dictatorship gets people ordered faster but the group that orders more efficiently and adapts to improve quality and efficiency out competes the dictatorship every time. I am not saying get out of line, definitely get with whatever the group is getting with even if you disagree but do not throw your input as to how to better it out the window.<br><br>If you do not know how to have orderly discourse and make decisions as a group I believe there is a pocket version of Roberts Rules of Order that  goes over the process we have ended up at as a civilization over the years refining our method of working together.

I believe ORDERLY discourse WHILE getting in line is the proper response. Create a group of groups to start organizing and propose the initial plan while starting it then adjust it as you go.

What if the media, the world health government was lieing to you about C-19 &amp; you spreading their lies does not make you smarter every day nor does it help the very people that you initially set out to help?<br><br>Imagine this, viruses are neither good or bad, they are all through our body &amp; their use is for communication between other parts of the body like warning signs that this area is under quarantine because the immune system needs to fix a certain problem in that area of the body. But sometimes this can trigger other viruses in the body to take advantage of that warning sign &amp; then do the same thing by shutting down their area of the body. The reason why this all happens is because of our bad diet of poisonous food that we ingest every day where we are not getting the required amount of vitamins &amp; minerals.<br><br>The remedy for these bodily dysfunctions is simple by getting the right vitamins, minerals, remove the toxic foods that we eat &amp; to have plenty of bed rest where we will recover quickly. There is no C-19 because they have blown out lies about symptoms that are normal but they are not telling you about what is the cause &amp; nor are they wanting to fix the cause. Their test for C-19 looks for various common traits that everyone has in their body, if the person is feeling a little under the weather then they&#39;ll label that as C-19. The reason for the lies so that that they can force vaccinations of the real virus that they can later switch on or off as a death sentence. They want to chip everyone saying it is for the new currency but it limits our freedom to travel or do things that we want to do, we will only be allowed to do what they want us to do.
