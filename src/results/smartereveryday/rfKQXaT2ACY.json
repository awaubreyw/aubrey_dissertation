Instead, this:<br>Because when you slow down sound as much as these video are slowed down all pitch is perceived as rhythm. Since all pitch is just  oscillations per second between a point of equilibrium (Hz) once a pitch is low enough- around 15Hz it stops being a super-low pitch and instead just sounds like a bunch of clicks/hits/gongs/etc", "comment_date": "2021-05-18T20:32:34Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "David David", "comment_text": "Cool video as usual.<br>I know you&#39;ve done it a while ago but when shooting in to the bottle, any chance to do it again but with layers of coloured layers of liquid.<br>It would be interesting to see the influence of a foreign object high velocity/ speed (excuse my spelling \ud83c\udde8\ud83c\uddf5\ud83c\uddea\ud83c\uddfa ) in a stable recipient.<br>Great entertaining/ educational videos.\ud83d\udc4c", "comment_date": "2021-05-16T08:09:37Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "VSA pro", "comment_text": "<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rfKQXaT2ACY&amp;t=4m21s\">4:21</a> one more experiment? yeah lets blow up a cat", "comment_date": "2021-05-05T15:12:53Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "James Roscoe", "comment_text": "I actually just watched this video because I&#39;m a teacher at an International school and is covering a similar topic, but actually just enjoyed the honesty of it all.. including the way in which you approached your sponsors..

One hertz would hit a sound at your ear once per second. 100th speed is actually much slower than that one per second, but despite that, I myself cannot actually explain why the audio starts to distort, unless it\u2019s got something to do with the way computers handle sound and it can\u2019t produce notes low enough so it just boosts the sound to make it sound slower.", "comment_date": "2019-05-27T08:24:23Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Tracey Jacobsen", "comment_text": "These are the sort of friends i want in life XD", "comment_date": "2019-05-26T13:09:55Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Greg Beck", "comment_text": "Love you man!!", "comment_date": "2019-05-25T22:31:06Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Mike Wood", "comment_text": "Edu-tainment!", "comment_date": "2019-05-22T23:09:56Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "komodomoe", "comment_text": "I think it would also be interesting to actually get into the physics of sound and why it just wouldn&#39;t work right where you&#39;re recording things where the movement exceeds the speed of sound.

I know that the Slowmo Guys said that high speed cameras don&#39;t record sound, and that they used to record the sound from a different source.  I think they mentioned that they had to actually have sound made for the slow motion footage once they started getting to such high frame rates that the sound from a normal camera wouldn&#39;t work anymore.  So, of course, now I&#39;ve become smarter.<br><br>Now to pay it back.  I&#39;m sure you, Destin, know what the art is called in the film industry, but this will be for those who don&#39;t know.  The technique is called Foley, and it is the art of adding sounds to footage that has no sound to it.  And as shown in the previous video on adding sounds, Foley artists will use a wide range of objects, tools, and all sorts of strange and unusual techniques to make sounds to be added into footage.  The current form of the technique has been around since the creation of &quot;talkies,&quot; also known as the first movies to have sound and voice in addition to music.  Though the technique has existed for far longer in a different form in theater.  And I have to say, the way they accomplish that is some serious &quot;magic&quot; that was eventually applied to the film industry, and the art of Foley will continue to grow and improve with new technology, and those who are dedicated to preserving the techniques that make it what it is.", "comment_date": "2018-01-01T03:14:07Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "orbik", "comment_text": "Can&#39;t you just record the audio with an ultrasonic mic and a high sample rate, let&#39;s say say 10MHz.

These waves are alternating. What we here when we slow it down very much is the individual ups and downs that start to be heard as seperate sounds, instead of the original &quot;Sound&quot; it was made up of. This is similar to the rocket launch because there we are hearing the wooshing sound of the oscilating waves underneath the rocket etc. <br><br>Many people seem to think that this is because of the microphone not being &quot;fast&quot; enough, but this is not really the problem. The issue is the sound itself - the way we experience sound as a wave (ie, a series of low and high pulses/transitions) means that the sound itself has a limited speed. If we record 10 frames per &quot;wavefront&quot; we can&#39;t slow it down because there is nothing to slow down! Think of it like there was a flashing light next to the banana. If it is flashing very, very fast (say 1000 times per second), it just seems like a dimmer version of it&#39;s non-flashing brother. But if we now slow down the footage, we can see that it is flashing on and off. We go from this continuous perception of brightness to a pulsing on-off light. There is no way to &quot;slow down the light&quot; because there is nothing to slow down. <br><br>I hope this makes any sense. Perhaps a simple animation or such could help here? <br>Adam Neely on youtube here did a video about this in a way, regarding music. The concept there was that if we have rythmic pulses going extremely fast, they would start sounding like low frequency tones. This is essentially the reverse: the tone is made out of low-frequency tones and waves, and if we slow down we start to hear the individual pulses and it sounds nothing like what we expect.", "comment_date": "2017-12-31T15:49:21Z", "likes_count": 4}, {"comment_by": "Tarek Barhoum", "comment_text": "Sorry Dustin <a href=\"http://23andme.com/smarter\">23andme.com/smarter</a> didn&#39;t work", "comment_date": "2017-12-31T15:48:18Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Hikari Hell", "comment_text": "I thing the sound get that distortes in slow motion because the wavelength of the audio get stretched out when you play it in a slower tempo than it&#39;s original tempo.<br>Is it right?", "comment_date": "2017-12-31T15:48:03Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Mykyta Shved", "comment_text": "Just slapped banana to my bro face", "comment_date": "2017-12-31T15:47:37Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Reilly Brangan", "comment_text": "And I thought yawning was contagious...", "comment_date": "2017-12-31T15:47:09Z", "likes_count": 2}, {"comment_by": "EpicVideos", "comment_text": "Is it possible to create a microphone which which records more frequencies per second?
