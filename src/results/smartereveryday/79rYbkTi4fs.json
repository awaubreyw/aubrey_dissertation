Now for the problem I lied on my medical I actually have bad ears and was deaf from 12-14 years old which actually increased my eye sight to 20/10. Once they found out that I lied and never said anything about my ears they barred me. Not sure if the USAF is as strict now but back then they were. I now have Vertigo because of my ears.

I first came across your channel to the RC Helicopter videos, and to watch your amazing videos go from there to your cooool interview with Obama and now flying a jet yourself, WOW! You continue to inspire me and countless other people. Keep up the excellent, amazing, awesome work. :)<br><br>And on a side note, I also failed the medical exam of Air Force due to photophobia.

I grew up under the flight pattern of the B1 bomber, KC-135, F-4 and later F-16 at McConnell Air force Base in Wichita, KS.  Every time I heard something flying over I was running out the front door to see.  I didn&#39;t have the limitations you had in my eyes, but my &quot;elders&quot; convinced me I was too tall to get in a jet and the dream was over.  I would have been a pilot during the first gulf war so probably a blessing in some ways.  Anyway, seeing a regular guy get to climb into a trainer and fly and be given the plane...What an honor.  Every one is commenting on the science...I just want to know if a regular guy like me could have the same opportunity?
