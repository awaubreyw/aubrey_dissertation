Dustin chose to acknowledge her labor and love for him and ate the bad food without complaint. She knew it was bad, she knew he thought it was bad too, but he communicated something much deeper and more loving by his actions than he could have by words. In that moment, in that time of stress in their lives, a gesture of unconditional love to his wife was much more powerful and wise than brutal honesty. There is a place for food criticism, and of course honesty is crucial in a marriage. But honesty wasnt needed, they both knew it was bad. <br><br>As for any of you who think he did it only so she would continue cooking for him, and not that he did it as an act of marital love, i cant fix your cynicism.", "comment_date": "2017-11-19T18:16:37Z", "likes_count": 4703}, {"comment_by": "Andrew Stombaugh", "comment_text": "You&#39;ve made some pretty amazing videos,  but this one probably tops them all so far!

I thought the food was Ok, but they thought it was disgusting and they all threw it away after telling me it was disgusting, I did cry and i felt so bad about it. But this taught me a valuable lesson, I learned how it felt when you take your time and make food for someone, and they just say &quot; its disgusting&quot;, this completely stopped me from wanting to make food for anyone but myself because i was afraid that they&#39;d hate it. After this happened i never told my parents that i didnt like their food, i always ate what i was served and i said it tasted good and enjoyed it. And i do the same for all my friends ,regardless what they serve me, i eat it. <br><br><br>Please- IF a person,family member or friend, girlfriend/boyfriend takes alot of time and love to cook you something.

So I sliced the spam, and then forgot to core the pineapple, so I had a pineapple with the core in it and then melted aldi cheese on top. My boyfriend at the time, (and now husband of almost 10 years) ate the entire plate and asked for 2nds. I thought it was awful and only took a few bites. Later that night, while watching shark week, he mentioned that most people take the core out of the pineapple, but he liked my spin on the meal.
