The thing is however that this is only when starting. When a speed skater starts he/she wants to get up to speed as quickly as possible. They do this by sort of running on the ice. They can only run on the ice if they put their skates sideways as you see in the video. This however is not actually skating. When they reach a certain speed is when they go over into skating/gliding.\r<br> \r<br>This is where things get interesting because instead of pushing to the back a speed skater pushes to the side. Pushing to the back isn\u2019t efficient because you move forward as well so a lot of power from that push to the back will get lost because the skater is moving forward. However if the skater pushes to the side that complete push can be transformed into forward moving motion. <br>\r<br>What is also very interesting is the way a speed skater moves from side to side transferring their body weight and using that to push themselves forward.

It comes across like you&#39;re suggesting his talent is impressive insofar as it demonstrates a capacity for things to which you may attach a much greater relative valuation than the hockey player, i.e., capacity for rational thought, mathematical ability, and understanding of physics, and so you mischaracterize the psychological and physiological abilities which actually facilitate the impressive feats performed by the hockey player.  Those feats are ends in themselves, and, throughout most of history, people attached a higher value to the talents and traits required to perform them at a high level.  Indeed, this is still the case in much of the world today, and even today in the West, the culture which has traditionally attached the greatest valuation to \ud835\uddc2\ud835\uddc7\ud835\uddcd\ud835\uddbe\ud835\uddc5\ud835\uddc5\ud835\uddc2\ud835\uddc0\ud835\uddbe\ud835\uddc7\ud835\uddbc\ud835\uddbe and scholarly pursuit when compared to the rest of the world, many if not most people still seem to value athletic performance and achievement more than academics.  Further, I don&#39;t think there is anything wrong with this\u2014there are dramatic apparent differences, not only between individuals,  but also between populations, in intellectual ability, just as there is with athletic ability, and those differences will almost certainly always remain.  Excessive attribution of value to \ud835\uddc2\ud835\uddc7\ud835\uddcd\ud835\uddbe\ud835\uddc5\ud835\uddc5\ud835\uddc2\ud835\uddc0\ud835\uddbe\ud835\uddc7\ud835\uddbc\ud835\uddbe results in a relative devaluation of physical ability, along with those people to whom nature endowed a relatively greater capacity for the same.   In the West, society has internalized this value to such a degree that, unlike any other difference in natural ability, large portions refuse to acknowledge even the possibility that biological differences in \ud835\uddc2\ud835\uddc7\ud835\uddcd\ud835\uddbe\ud835\uddc5\ud835\uddc5\ud835\uddc2\ud835\uddc0\ud835\uddbe\ud835\uddc7\ud835\uddbc\ud835\uddbe exist.

On a population level, groups of people who otherwise happily tout the certainty of speciation through evolution (admittedly, the vast majority of whom have little-to-no understanding of what &#39;evolution&#39; actually is), state with equal certainty that the trait which, far more than any other, distinguishes man from the rest of the animal kingdom, somehow became immune, entirely, from those environmental pressures which, like all other traits, produced it in the first place, so that, despite obvious observable differences in other traits, along with basically all evidence from academic research on the topic pointing to consistent and easily measurable differences in \ud835\uddc2\ud835\uddc7\ud835\uddcd\ud835\uddbe\ud835\uddc5\ud835\uddc5\ud835\uddc2\ud835\uddc0\ud835\uddbe\ud835\uddc7\ud835\uddbc\ud835\uddbe existing between populations of genetically related peoples, they believe that our brain, an incredibly energy-intensive organ with a capacity for reason which has rapidly deviated from what our ancestors&#39; brains were capable of even a million years ago, and unlike all other traits, either experienced identical selection pressures, including associated pressures resulting from sexual preference, in all populations across the globe for the last 100-thousand years (remarkably, contemporary homo erectus populations did not have the same absolute homogeneity in selection pressure), or was entirely immune from selection pressures, as a result of some yet-to-even-be hypothesized mechanism which shielded it in such a way as to avoid hurting the feelings of the excessively sensitive among populations which would exist in the last half of the twentieth, and the beginning of the twenty-first, centuries.  Remarkably, whatever the character of such a mechanism, it also resulted in large amounts of observable evidence of a lack of its existence.   <br>\r<br>Perhaps, had we not attached so much social value to \ud835\uddc2\ud835\uddc7\ud835\uddcd\ud835\uddbe\ud835\uddc5\ud835\uddc5\ud835\uddc2\ud835\uddc0\ud835\uddbe\ud835\uddc7\ud835\uddbc\ud835\uddbe, such that people would come to believe that even small differences in the degree to which a person exhibits it changes his worth as a human being, then the study of the trait which has shaped our history more than any other, wouldn&#39;t have to occur behind the pretense that differences in it cannot explain any differences in the outcomes we observe, because it is impossible that such differences could have existed.", "comment_date": "2021-08-19T10:40:04Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Mark S", "comment_text": "I clicked on this so it would stop showing on my feed.", "comment_date": "2021-08-19T01:40:54Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "DomCraftVR films", "comment_text": "I&#39;m a hockey goalie myself and.

This allows the bike to back in or &quot;feint&quot; in to use the car drifting term, and be steered from the rear with a balance of ever decreasing front brake pressure, and clutch slip.  The braking trail off is a discretionary, sometimes you may need to still be trailing a little front brake sometimes not.<br><br><br>Likewise feathering the throttle all the while, and then going positive throttle to actually increase rear tyre spin on exit as you&#39;re standing the bike back up, gradually so that when the rear tyre hooks up once you&#39;re upright, (larger contact patch toward the sole than in the tyre shoulder increases grip suddenly) and you are shot off down the straight, is also a learned skill.

That&#39;s because I kept my centre of mass was always pretty much directly over where the blade was, so when I was decelerating, my centre of mass slowed down slower than my feet did and caused me to tip. And learning that hockey players decelerate fast by tilting the blade so that one point sheers through the ice plays into that as they tilt their body to add more pressure to the blade, making it difficult a little deeper as well as preventing them from falling over or losing balance at all.

If you don&#39;t know this already, google phase diagram of pure substances, and then google phase diagram of water. Water is the only substance (at least that I know) in the world that, while holding temperature constant, would change into liquid phase under higher pressure. This is why that film of liquid would exist between skate blade and ice in the first place. Under normal conditions, the ice would just be in the skating rink minding it&#39;s own business. When the skate blade hits the top of the ice surface with a person&#39;s body weight leaning on it, it applies localized pressure at the skate blade contact point. It would then melt the contacting ice surface due to higher pressure, creating a film of liquid, thus allowing skates to slip on the ice.", "comment_date": "2016-01-06T04:06:16Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Jack chris", "comment_text": "Omg this guy knows nothing about hockey does he u have a sharpener and u kinda turn the skate as u go my god", "comment_date": "2016-01-05T07:39:24Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Dusty Tapez", "comment_text": "some day i will have kids and this will be the very first channel they subscribe to. just awesome.", "comment_date": "2016-01-04T18:20:41Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Alexander Lee", "comment_text": "wish I could see a quad jump in this kind of slow motion!", "comment_date": "2015-12-30T04:35:35Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "MyTube6444", "comment_text": "Anyone saw this at Kendal ice arena?

You oversimplified how the speed skates actually work.  The angling rearward edge pushing ONLY applies at the start going from zero to low speeds.  As a skater gains speed, their edge angle for pushing shifts to being almost parallel to travel direction, and push force direction shifts to very near 90\u00ba to travel direction.  The faster you go the less you can gain speed with a rearward push.  So at speed, a skater must redirect their power push to go outward at 90\u00ba to the travel direction, in order to get any kind of a speed boost in the forward direction.  <br>So, how is this possible for a 90\u00ba lateral push to accelerate you forward?  It&#39;s because of centripetal acceleration. Once at speed every, push stroke of a skater carves an ARC on the ice, which means they travel along on series of alternatingly opposite gradual curved arcs with each opposing  leg&#39;s push.  During the lateral push phase of the stroke, the skater&#39;s body mass gets laterally shifted toward the center of the skate&#39;s curving arc path.  By rolling on an arc path while also laterally pushing the body&#39;s mass closer to the center of that arc, this defines a a centripetal acceleration, and it is why the skater gains speed, without any  of their push force being directed rearward.", "comment_date": "2015-09-08T20:22:41Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Dalton Domagala", "comment_text": "figure skaters are a goalies worst night mare because the make holes in our crease", "comment_date": "2015-09-06T05:37:45Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Jerome778", "comment_text": "Ama zing!", "comment_date": "2015-09-05T02:51:13Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "joemamma", "comment_text": "You were in Huntsville, awesome.", "comment_date": "2015-08-27T03:01:10Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "ringtyler", "comment_text": "Woo!
