If you follow a drop of water as it is released from the spigot in exactly the 6 o&#39;clock position (for a counter-clockwise rotation) the droplet will land say, somewhere between 5 and 4 o&#39;clock, so it will be &quot;ahead&quot; of where it was released.<br><br>Steve is considering the problem with respect to an inertial frame of reference, which he&#39;s trying to allude to by saying &quot;snapshot&quot; but is simply failing to use sufficiently technical terminology. In this scenario, the frame of reference rotates with the spigots, so they&#39;re essentially fixed, even though they&#39;re imparting angular momentum to the water droplets. Watch the &quot;straight line&quot; trajectory of the water droplet at <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M4-L8UgPkOk&amp;t=5m18s\">5:18</a>, and keep in mind which spigot it was released from. At <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M4-L8UgPkOk&amp;t=5m23s\">5:23</a>, that droplet is &quot;ahead&quot; of its release point, but it is <b>well behind</b> the spigot that it was released from, because the angular velocity at the end of the spigot is greater than the sum velocity vector of the droplet of water, (which, after it has been released from the spigot, technically has zero angular velocity.) Thus from an inertial frame of reference, the droplet is trailing the spigot, (and in a snapshot this is clearly illustrated by the stream of droplets, because the further they get from the spigot, the more they have lagged behind its rotation.)<br><br>Frame of reference is always necessary to establish, (it simply happens to be &quot;assumed&quot; in many contexts,) when attempting to accurately model the motion of objects.

I was hoping you would remember the two forces that come into play. Gravity is one of them which is what pulls the water down and isn\u2019t that important; however, the force of friction due to air, or drag force, is acting on the water as soon as it leaves (detaches) from the pipe. As I learned in physics class years ago the water will not be able to move faster than the spout or sprinkler. In fact, if this was a vacuum it would only be able to move in one direction which is out and away as well as down. The arc would appear but the water cannot propel itself as it is merely water. All in all what you are saying is wrong because you forgot drag force slowing it down. The water is also traveling at the same speed as the sprinkler and cannot move faster than the sprinkler.

And the answer is, if you are in a \u201cuniform\u201d gravity field, there\u2019s no way the observer can distinguish between acceleration and gravity. There\u2019s many examples that you can understand this without problem: accelerating elevator, accelerating vehicles, in which cases, observers experience change of gravity in direction/magnitude, and proves observers cannot tell the difference. One abnormal example is, accelerating box in space (without gravity), in which case observers will just feel like standing still as on earth.<br><br>And here comes the interesting one, the rotational frame. In a rotational system, the observers moving along system experiences gravity as well, but the acceleration is not uniform and is proportional to the distance to the center of rotation. This concept is even feature in an anime as an artificial gravity field created on space ship years ago. In the other words, for the case in this video, if you edit the footage so that the camera is following the sprinklers, then those water will subject to the effective gravity and fall outward. That\u2019s the effort I would like to see as addition.<br><br>Just add in few details for anyone interested. The effective gravity is proportional to \u03c9*r (if I remember it correctly), \u03c9 is the angular velocity, r is distance to the center, and \u03c9=\u03c9(t) is a function of time if the rotation is not uniform. Second, if you observe along sprinklers, you will see that the water is shooting to the left or right, that\u2019s because the initial velocity of water depends on \u03c9, which could have positive sign and negative sign, and therefore water can have different direction.", "comment_date": "2019-12-30T22:39:08Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Nikko J", "comment_text": "<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M4-L8UgPkOk&amp;t=9m57s\">9:57</a> Stop, collaborate and listen.

But Smarter is incorrect on the first. The vector direction is correct, but Smarter fails to think about the fact that as distance from muzzle increases - there is no additional energy or speed added... it almost is like he is thinking of centrifugal forces as they are further away from the center, still within the system.. Then, yes.. the outside is faster than the inside. With a long enough pipe or simple thing, you would see that pattern as materials bend. But the stuff coming out will be affected by air particles and slow down so that vector which was moving in the direction of motion for the spin, and another straight out for the flow of water.. If we treat them separate, it is super easy to see that the jet will never be faster than the spinning piece after ejection. It will spew outward in a parabola and get slowed down that way. It will also slow down from moving in the direction of the spin, so you end up with a \\ points visual effect instead of /. ie: it looks like it is curving back and that is because older water has slowed enough to hit the ground and is further from where the new water is ejected. If you play the thought experiment, or even a slow video you can see the bit that lands on the ground will continue around like it is following the water. edit: and you said the same thing... illusion, vectors, and all.<br><br><br>As for the other - either it&#39;ll look like a tornado... or something like that. I have a few other theories because the centrifugal force has to overcome the change in direction, with the water pressure... Because of higher water pressure, it may overcome those forces going outward... I don&#39;t think it&#39;ll be able to come back out because of the high water pressure, even without it, because there is a higher pressure pushing outward, but the change in direction causes it to come back towards... So it should come inward, collide with other water and make something which extends up and outward. - edit: just saw it is also just a stream... The collisions seemed clear to me, plus the outward momentum... This could be used to create cone extending upward and outward with the right tips, etc.. The centrifugal forces increase and add more energy...<br><br><br>Again, pretty much the same said about it except the part about the appearance...

One shot out from the end though and one shot out form closer to the center so it kinda got to cheat and go forward. <br><br>There\u2019s one trick I\u2019ve learned on my own as a kid  and it\u2019s served me well my whole life. If you\u2019re having trouble grasping something or figuring out something  blow it wayyyyy out of proportion in your mind. Have those copper lines 1000 <br>feet/meters whatever and spinning 500 mph. Have that cooper tube wrap all the way back to almost the middle the move it just a bit and you can picture it shooting forward from acceleration.  If you\u2019re trying to figure out verticals angles and what might happen instead of a few inches high think ok what would happen if I had to reach the moon with those angles. Whatever. Just blow the experiment way out of proportion in your head as a hypothetical and some answers come to you so quickly you feel dumb you didn\u2019t get it when it was on a smaller scale.  Sadly this isn\u2019t the best example of that, nor was my example haha. I just thought I\u2019d share that though. I said the angle thing becise I was sharpening a knife yesterday then got a bigger knife and wondered if the angle 15\u00b0 would work the same regardless of how high the knife was. I wasn\u2019t sure for a moment. Then in my mind I made the height of the knife as high as the moon and then it was very obvious that no way to meet the peek thee mask ally be going straight up in the sky. They\u2019d look almost or would look vertical.

All things being equal, those particles decelerate the second they leave the nozzle because they no longer have rotational energy being applied to them. If the water pressure pushing the particle out at a given velocity is also the same force rotating the nozzles at the same velocity, I think if you measured the linear distance covered (using pi for the nozzle) you&#39;d find the nozzle traveled farther during any given time frame. If true, then the nozzle is travelling at a higher velocity than the particle once it leaves the nozzle, and the particle could never lead the nozzle.

Years ago I read one of Debono&#39;s books on thinking and one suggestion of his is don&#39;t believe / disbelieve in anything 100% - so it allows our mind to absorb new info.  He had a wonderful diagram of a ring over a stick suspended above a &quot;pit of ?iniquity&quot;  As you learnt more about something you could move the ring along the stick toward one end belief or the other end disbelief.  100% belief or disbelief meant the ring would come off the end of the stick and fall into the pit.  If it stayed on the stick, it was much easier to absorb new info and thus be able to move backwards (or forwards) on the stick.

Now imagine the droplet leaving the spout. If the spout stopped immediately the direction of travel for the droplet would be on the same side of the centre as the spout was heading, i.e. for the counterclockwise (CCW) in the video, it would drift to the right. But that droplet is not influenced by angular momentum anymore because it&#39;s not spinning now - it&#39;s just heading in the direction it had before. The force on it is simply air resistance and gravity.<br><br><br>So why does it appear to lead the spout? I think it&#39;s because if you fire a water droplet to the right of the centre and then move the spout CCW, the droplet will appear to be to the right of the new direction that the spout is pointing. Assuming the pressure was enough to keep the droplet moving to  get out of the &quot;circle&quot; before the spout caught up.<br><br><br>In fact, I&#39;m going to suggest that if you fired the droplets slightly to either side, not only would it create a self-spinning sprinkler.

Ignoring drag, we can say that any initial velocity (orthogonal to gravity) will be conserved.

However, in order for the particles to move together in a line, omega would need to be the same for each particle. This is untrue for both cases. In the outward case, r is increasing for each particle, and v-tangential is constant. So omega decreases like 1/r with r&gt;1. The farther out a particle is, the lower the omega, so the curve \u201dlags\u201d. Similarly, for the inward case, v-tangential is constant but r is decreasing at a constant rate, so omega increases like 1/r with r&lt;1.

If your stated theory was correct then the tangential speed should still lag behind the exit of the copper tubing, due to resistance with the air, similar to the first sprinkler. I think that the water at the tip of the copper tubing is initially hitting the air resistance and lagging behind, but then the water that is under pressure behind that is meeting that water resistance and choosing to be expelled in the opposite direction of that resistance, at a trajectory ahead of the copper tubing.

However, when the wheel is accelerated, this produces a tangential force, pushing the fluid molecules in the direction of motion.

If you reduce/increase the radius (distance between droplet and rotational center in the video)  it has to get a higher/lower angular velocity to conserve angular momentum in the rotational center.", "comment_date": "2019-10-15T10:34:22Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Avner Tishby", "comment_text": "Destin I&#39;m only half way through so maybe you address this later on, but in the first experiment a drop of water ejected from the nozzle will have the same tangential velocity (&quot;sidewards&quot; as you call it) as the nozzle, but will also have an outward velocity, therefore moving it away from the center of rotation. For this reason it very clearly can not keep up with the nozzle - its angular velocity will be smaller due to a larger radius of rotation, and so it will trail behind in terms of angular position. How can you argue otherwise?<br><br>Edit: rewatching your visualization with vectors of instantaneous velocity for the water drop as it leaves the pipe, why aren&#39;t you also showing the instantaneous velocity for the tip of the pipe (what I called the nozzle)? To make matters worse you then go on to show the drop of water&#39;s velocity and position over a period of time yet ignore the fact that the pipe has also moved on and changed velocity and position. You&#39;re a smart guy so please tell me what I&#39;m missing? Is this a matter of not choosing the same reference frame? The nozzle&#39;s is non-inertial while the drop&#39;s is inertial in the plane perpendicular to gravity.<br><br>Edit2: Watched the whole thing now and this is the exact reason why you should expect the drop of water to &quot;trail forward&quot; relative to the nozzle in the second experiment: same tangential velocity as the nozzle but this time a shorter distance from the center of rotation, or in other words a smaller radius, resulting in higher angular velocity.<br><br>I think the confusion here is indeed a result of the nozzle&#39;s reference frame being non-inertial. I also suspect it has something to do with the coriolis force on the individual water droplets (in the rotating reference frame of the nozzle) and the fact that it&#39;s difficult to follow the trajectory of a single droplet, and easier to (incorrectly) visualize the stream of water as if it were a single object (which it isn&#39;t of course).<br><br>I&#39;d love to hear what you think!

This can be visualized by rotating the video with the sprinkler to set the pipe as the reference frame.

It is the opposite of the case where, when you swing a ball tied to a thread and you let go, it has tangential velocity but zero angular velocity. When we let go of the string there is nothing preventing the ball moving sideways. On the other hand the walls of the pipe stop the bead (or in this case water) and zero their tangential velocity.

We think the nozzle is always pointing at the center of rotation and it is, but the water is moving tangentially to that direction once rotation begins.", "comment_date": "2019-10-15T04:35:43Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "alexnd1ke393", "comment_text": "Confirmation bias is a fun thing", "comment_date": "2019-10-15T04:34:16Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Opa Knows", "comment_text": "You traveled across an ocean to do this?

In that case, the water is still pushing against the elbow in the same direction as before, indicating that we might see rotation in the same direction...but now the other force is reversed because the end of each tube is pulling water towards it, which indicates rotation in the other direction.

While the x-y position of the spout does move, it&#39;s the direction it&#39;s pointing that dominates the effect. Kind of like moving a camera a foot to the right but rotating it 60 degrees to the left: rotation will dominate and the picture would overall move left. So here, each individual spout is rotating the direction it points counter-clockwise, and indeed each spout&#39;s stream is lagging behind that counter-clockwise rotation, as our intuition would expect.

There comes a speed when it looks as if the water is travelling backwards, because the tip of the nozzle is moving so fast that it gets to the other side of the circle before the ejected water does, and suddenly instead of going straight, the water looks like it is going backwards. You were right, because you initially said it would stop and turn around and go backwards, away from the center, because yes, with the addition of some rotational velocity, it goes outwards rather than inwards, and with some time delay, the tip moves far enough it gives the illusion of a curved stream.<br><br><br>The whole reason the simple tube experiment is simple arcs made from straight lines, is because the further from the tip, the further out of phase the water gets, until eventually at some distance 2r it is 1 rotation behind the tip out of phase. This is why the inwards jets look weird, because theyre going forwards in phase instead of backwards, because theyre getting closer to the center, and actually exit the circle before the tip of the nozzle gets there. <br><br><br>At some speed, the rotational velocity will outpace the ejected velocity, and it will immediately just be flung away and smacked by the nozzle. Hypothetically, at some speed ridiculously high, it would reverse the flow, because the tip of the nozzle would actually move ahead of where the water would be going, because the water is launched from slightly closer to the center than the edge of the tube.<br><br><br>But it is all described by phase.

Simply because that is the way the continuous... &quot;graph&quot; looks like). I would say destin is correct as he describes its actual motion (the water has tangential motion and radial motion, the radial motion making water fly outwards over time, while the tangential motion moved further away, making it move less of the circumference each tick than the spout. Not to mention it doesn&#39;t remain tangential as there is no anti-radial acceleration, so it can&#39;t create kepler orbits), while mould were thinking of how the curve you can draw from the spout as you follow the older water curves backwards.<br><br>edit: later in the video now, and they seem to bring this point up. And it is even more evident in the second device, as it is shooting water inwards: You see that as the radius decreases, the &quot;angular velocity&quot; increases (moving tangentially with same speed as it left, it traverses a large portion of the circumference, as it moves same distance per tick, but circle is smaller). You also see what I mentioned about how a lack of anti-radial accerelation makes what was a tangential velocity quickly turn into something that is not tangential (compared to the portion of the circle a line drawn from the colored droplet to the circles center intersects with), meaning there are no kepler orbits. Which is why you see the droplet move in a straight line, and the apparent motion of the stream looks like it curves into a u-turn.<br><br><br>edit2: finished video now, this whole video reminds me of the xkcd comic about centrifugal forces. Mould isn&#39;t _right_, but he isn&#39;t wrong either. He is seeing an apparent motion by looking at the rotating spout as stationary and motion as the curve fitted to the &quot;datapoints&quot;. Which was why he was so adamant to using snapshots despite lugging out a slo-mo camera that would let them track droplets (why didn&#39;t you take the effort to make it a laminar flow btw?

If there&#39;s the 4 points of a compass on the floor and the water droplet is leaving on the north leg with rotation being clockwise, the water droplet would fly off in a more north-easterly direction and as it rotates from north to east, the path of the water would arc from the most easterly point of the &#39;sprayer&#39;s&#39; circumference through roughly a quarter circle northwards with water droplets further apart the further around the arc they are.<br><br><br>With the U-bend I think the spray would be similar in the same quarter rotation with smaller water droplets, potentially with portions of laminar flow, as it would fan out more, but not from the front edge as it rotates, with the water that would exit from that front edge in a static fountain scenario spraying over the top of the rest like the water moving around a car&#39;s tyres as they go through a puddle at speed.<br><br><br>I&#39;m a very low level engineering student so have probably typed a load of rubbish above.

The body in this free fall will not perceive any acceleration, unless something to do with some atmosphere and etc. Well, for the water this is a straight line, for us, it&#39;s not.

This is because rotational velocity is linear lateral velocity divided by radius and as it heads inward, the linear lateral velocity doesn&#39;t change (much) but the radius rapidly decreases. This gives an appearance of curving ahead.<br>On the outward spouts, however, the opposite happens. The lateral velocity doesn&#39;t change, but the r adius increases, which corresponds to a decreasing rotational velocity and the appearance of lagging behind.<br><br>In other news, the message at the end about being very certain in even incorrect theories really hits home with me, though for me I don&#39;t really interact with anyone on an equal level in physics and whatever (either the other person is basically clueless and asking me to explain something or I&#39;m asking a physicist to explain to me something I don&#39;t get) so it mostly applies to things outside of STEM (not to mention that I&#39;m rarely wrong xP).", "comment_date": "2019-10-13T20:27:25Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Grex Ursorum", "comment_text": "Thanks a lot.

It&#39;s because angluar velocity = transitional velocity * radius from point of rotation. So on a rigid body like the spigot, the instantaneous velocity of a particle on the spigot is moving faster on the outside than it is on the inside. and the exact moment the water leaves the spigot, it has the same velocity as the tip of the spigot. When the water is shooting outward, the velocity of the particle is maintained but it&#39;s distance from the center of the spigot increases. If we were to imagine extending the tip of the spigot along with the water, we would see that the spigot would have to be moving faster than the water. Therefore the water lags. <br><br><br><br><br>The converse is when the water is shooting inwards. Again we have to recognize that the velocity of the water is not changing. If we track a point on the spigot along with the water we can see that as we move inward the instantaneously velocity of a point on the spigot is decreasing. Therefore the water is moving faster and leading. <br><br><br>If this is confusing, another way to think about this is to consider the angular velocity of the water particle itself (which personally is easier for me), with reference to the center of the spigot.

The water leaves the nozzle with a certain tangential velocity however since it is moving closer to the center the part of the pipe close to the center has a lower tangential velocity making the water move further away from the parts of the pipe close to the center. This happens because the pipes tangential velocity is relative to the center meaning it will change and keep turning in the direction of the circle while the water&#39;s tangential velocity is fixed.

Gong by your explanation, the water should have two velocity components when it comes out of the nozzle , but I think it will just have one. The angular velocity that you consider, is relative to the observer on land. So, that cannot explain why the stream takes a &quot;visually&quot; curved path(though individual droplets only have linear velocity). Imagine sitting on top of the nozzle and observing the droplets. You will notice that relative direction of motion of each droplet (as it exits the nozzle) to its preceding droplet is opposite to the direction of motion of the nozzle. So just like how we add up the relative velocity of two objects in antithetical direction, we feel that the water is going ahead of the nozzle. In the the first case where the water was forced away from the center, the same explanation holds, just that the relative direction is positive, so we subtract the relative velocities and the water looks like it is trailing.

I believe as Steve would explain it, the droplet of water has a fixed velocity as it leaves the nozzle, as you explain. As a rotating object moves away from the center of rotation, it requires a higher velocity to move the same angular distance. Because the velocity is fixed when leaving the nozzle, as a droplet moves away from the center of rotation, it has less velocity than a point at that radius on the line drawn by the nozzle, so it falls behind, and so the group of all the water droplets creates a curve falling behind the nozzle. Likewise, in the inward pointing device, as a droplet moves inward toward the center of rotation, it maintains its velocity, which moving inward is faster than a point at that radius on the nozzle, so it moves ahead of it, with the group of all points creating an arc curving ahead of the nozzle.", "comment_date": "2019-10-13T14:38:03Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Gorazd Novsak", "comment_text": "I think if you would turn it even faster it would be realy intetesting...", "comment_date": "2019-10-13T14:37:39Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "reuben", "comment_text": "Your videos make me wonder how YouTube is free.", "comment_date": "2019-10-13T14:37:26Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Colin", "comment_text": "I clicked on this video Sunday morning so nothing to complain about here, carry on", "comment_date": "2019-10-13T14:37:22Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Keenan Krieger", "comment_text": "This is basically how marching band works.", "comment_date": "2019-10-13T14:36:59Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Dean Hamlin", "comment_text": "It&#39;s a humble person that&#39;s truly the smartest.

Turns out they both are ! But while Destin says one of them is sort of an &quot;optical illusion&quot;, I&#39;ll try to convince you that they both make perfect physical sense.<br>So the first perspective where you draw a circle around a droplet and follow it in a straight line corresponds to an inertial reference frame, while looking at the snapshot and the curve the water is creating corresponds to a rotating, non-galilean reference frame. To visualise this better, imagine the camera rotated exactly in sync with the device. In this kind of reference frame, you see an actual force appearing, called the Coriolis force, which curves the trajectory of moving objects in a circle. The way it works is if an object is moving away from the axis of rotation, its trajectory will be curved in the opposite direction of the rotation (it trails behind), and if it moves inwards the opposite happens (it gets ahead of the rotation). Now the actual math here involves a cross product between the vector representing the angular velocity of the system and the velocity of the water particle, but a simpler way of undertanding this phenomenon is within the inertial frame : v=wr (where w is angular speed), so this means that while the actual speed of a particle is conserved, if the radius increases, its angular speed decreases and vice-versa.<br>My point here is that while this isn&#39;t magic or anything, and it can all be explained in the inertial frame, the rotating frame is a valid, if not galilean, point of view and there&#39;s an actual force, if not a causal one (that is to say that its only cause is the rotation itself and the movement of the object and not an action) at play here.", "comment_date": "2019-10-13T14:36:24Z", "likes_count": 5}, {"comment_by": "a_ j", "comment_text": "thanks Destin", "comment_date": "2019-10-13T14:36:06Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "cpope09", "comment_text": "Perspective changes everything.

Will a bullet fired from a moving vehicle have more energy that a bullet fired while standing still? The simple answer is yes. The bullet will not be imparted with the full say 45 mph in forward velocity along with it&#39;s sideways velocity of 1200 fps. For one, the bullet will only contact the barrel, going sideways for a fraction of a second. The acceleration of being fired 1200 fps in a change of direction will loose most of the 45mph, but not all of it. Technically the bullet will have a tiny increase in energy. I proved this by pointing out there are not two directions that the bullet is traveling at two speeds, the trajectory is diagonal away from the vehicle with one measurable velocity. The speed of the vehicle will have a very small effect because of how slow it is compared to the firing of the round. In a more equal situation, like in the video, the diagonal movement is exaggerated compared to my situation therefore more easily observed.

Although the Premiere feature notifies subscribers of the video and builds \u201chype\u201d, it makes it seem like the video is uploaded and published, only to disappoint people with a long timer. Because of this, many of the people who clicked on the video before it\u2019s actual release thinking it was uploaded will then click away, only to never get the notification again and thus actually never watch it when it is playable. The video often gets less views in the end and does not get as much interaction overall as when a video is released ready to play. Just a thought! Love your videos man, but not sure about Premier is the way to go. Maybe announce the video in a Community Post or YouTube Story? That way, we\u2019ll still get the notification when the video is actually published for us to play!<br><br>Like so Destin can see!<br><br>Thx :)", "comment_date": "2019-10-13T05:09:05Z", "likes_count": 10}, {"comment_by": "Alex Taradov", "comment_text": "Premieres suck.
