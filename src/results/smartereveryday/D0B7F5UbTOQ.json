I still have marks on my arm because of the tattoo removal. Anyhow, i had another tattoo on my back that i wanted to remove and there was no way i was going to do a laser treatment. So i found this book where they explain a painless way to get rid of your tattoo. I never thought there would be a natural way to get rid of your tattoo. This guy is a genius\u2026 He found a way to remove tattoos without the laser treatment and it works way better for me. No itching no pain no marks. And also very cheap. Its amazing. I\u2019m glad i got rid of the tattoo the painless way. This is the link to the book . I hope i can do someone favor with this and trust me.

I have a tattoo of a skull with a dead tree growing through it and I get asked a lot what the meaning behind it is and to be totally honest, I can&#39;t answer that question very simply due to the fact that it&#39;s just one piece of a larger picture that will be part of my sleeve and entire tattoo scheme. I chose that particular picture because I just loved the imagery of it, but it fits the scheme of life and death that I&#39;m going for with my tattoos. If you&#39;re going to get a tattoo, first make sure that you REALLY want it so you don&#39;t just throw your money down the drain and get it removed, also go to a certified professional and not some rundown janky ink parlor or just a friend that watched a youtube video once.", "comment_date": "2016-12-22T17:01:49Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "diana", "comment_text": "Would this hurt?

Except for chemistry, I never really managed to get along with science.

Yet, when I started watching your clips, I am sure I did not have the comprehension skills I have today. But it didn&#39;t matter! I love your english and your way of talking.

The frosting caused by the laser usually lasts up to 20 minutes after the treatment. The frosting is actually nitrogen bubbles created in the skin when the ink fragmentation takes place. Also if you use a Q switch laser for the tattoo removal (the vast majority are Q switch) then no heat is created, the laser actually fragments the particles with shock wavers. IPL which is not recommended for laser tattoo removal due to scar risks is the systems that heats the ink as is not as affective as Q switch. Other than that all the other explanations are spot on.

Red, orange and yellow are usually azo pigments, for example C.I.11767, C.i. 12475;<br>3. Dioxazine purple is purple;<br>4. Quinacridone magenta is magenta;<br>5. Inorganic pigments used for tattoo ink are white titanium dioxide, and carbon black.<br><br>Some manufacturers use diketo-pyrrolo-pyrrole red and iron oxides for brown. Chlorinated copper phthalocyanine is banned in Europe, so chlorobrominated is used (Green #36). But in general, there are no cadmium, lead or mercury compounds in tattoo ink.
