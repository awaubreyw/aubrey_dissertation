In a strip of analog film, you have crystals of silver salts, none of them are identical, every single crystal has a different size and orientation and every frame has a different arrangement. Of course they have to be kept within a certain size range (this is partially what determines the ISO value) - this is what makes it look more &quot;natural&quot; and pleasing to the eyes (in my opinion, to my eyes). Even if you film a 30 second clip of a completely static subject where nothing moves, every frame is still unique. A digital sensor has all the same sized pixels arranged neatly in rows and columns. If you did the same thing with a digital camera, you wouldn&#39;t be able to tell if you were looking at full-motion video or a still photograph. This is why movies shot on digital cameras look so bland and ... &quot;creamy&quot; is a good way to put it. The way they capture extreme value ranges is also different, meaning the darkest darks and the brightest lights.&quot;</i> <br><br>To my mind it&#39;s like describing the difference between anbidealized, but sterile mathematical structure, and an actual living organism.", "comment_date": "2022-08-13T12:06:27Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Robin J.", "comment_text": "Q.

I started in 35 mm photography in 1990 (I used a 110 camera before that).  Back then, you took your film to a lab and had prints back in a day or 2.  Then Walmart and drug stores started doing processing in-store in 1 hour. Good stuff!  The printing was all analog: shining light through the negatives on to photo sensitive paper, which went through the machine in a continuous strip, tracking into each chemical tank, with the paper speed set to be in the bath for the correct time. It came out on the back side dry, in about 10 minutes, and was cut into 4x6 prints.  The printer (machine operator) color corrected each image visually looking at the negative.  The corrections were printed on the back of the print, and if they were off, the printer would reprint with better corrections.  It was an art in itself.  <br><br>Then the Fuji Frontier came out, and it was revolutionary.  The machine scanned the roll, and the printer could color correct on a positive image. Much more accurate and faster than correcting from the negative view.  Once the roll was corrected, the computer exposed the photographic paper using red, green, and blue lasers, then it was processed through the machine the same was as above.  My friend owned a photo lab and had 2 Fuji Frontier machines. He said that Fuji was the first to develop the blue laser that made the laser exposure possible, so no other companies could use that technology.  Indie lab uses just the scanner portion of the whole Fuji Frontier machine.  The prints that came out of those machines were phenomenal.  I&#39;ve always loved Fuji&#39;s colors, especially the vivid blues and greens. Kodak colors were more muted.  Through the 90&#39;s and early 2000&#39;s, I was a professional photographer shooting all sorts of events and weddings on film.  I much prefer the images out of my Sony digital mirrorless camera, and the control that I have over the look of the final image, rather than handing off to another person.  I have started digitizing my film images using my Sony camera, but have no desire to go back to film. I still have all of my old film cameras and lenses, 35mm and 120.", "comment_date": "2022-07-22T04:21:57Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Roy Reynolds", "comment_text": "I am so glad I have kept my Nikormat 35 that I bought in 1974.

I got into film scanning in around 2002 for the purpose of generating Webpage content; really painful for home early adopters. The tools were primitive and it could take an hour per shot to get it to your needs. Apple&#39;s software was the best and Adobe Photoshop was a game changer. Oddly, for batch processing for the web (you often needed a consistent size and resolution with compression), Google&#39;s Picasa (now gone) was just fantastic.  Early Digital cameras were really disappointing. I had a Olympus that could store only 6-8 shots at high resolution. Flash memory was slow and low capacity. Addressing this one issue was what changed the world. Because there was a huge commodity market for &quot;digital film&quot; (flash SD cards) the price and capacity plummetted. This and cheap system on a chip processors allowed for MP3 players, higher resolution digital cameras, Internet of Things and many more evolutionary steps. All these things need deep storage and this one inflection point made that a reality.  It is funny, Kodak has contributed so much to ancillary markets. Chip fabrication is an ultra high resolution lithographic process. Kodak Research was involved in Cryptography.  I did not know they had a museum. That will be on my list.

One major drawback about film is you have to have your exposure right on the money or your image will never come out perfect because you cannot put back into the film the missing information.  With digital, it is there, even if you can&#39;t see it. You can tweak the image later and get it out! So, digital is much more forgiving.  Second, if you print your images in a darkroom and develop in chemicals, first you do not have nearly the control you have with digital software.  Second, you are breathing in chemicals that are not good for you.  The idea that a film based image has a different feel than a digital image is not true.  I cannot be more adamant about that.  If you want a &quot;feel&quot; there are countless ways to get it through digital means.

I gathered that the film is ultimately processed with chemicals, which I wonder if they cause the cancer, be it the chemicals themselves or the fumes and vapor the residue gives off. That said, film is scanned, seen on a computer by a person, and retouched by a professional version of &quot;photo shop&quot; for lack of a better term in my vocabulary and then printed that way.<br><br>I would also be curious to how the 1 Hour Photo worked. I remember my Mother dropping off film at a booth, then we&#39;d go to the store, and on the way home, or the next day, she&#39;s get envelopes full of pictures. It is like magic. And she took a LOT of pictures on a lot of film. That was all we had back then.<br><br>I was put off that people see someone&#39;s photos. Signed papers or not. I am the kind of person that is very private and it creeps me out to think that someone else actually saw me, my family, our dogs, and other things. We didn&#39;t put photos on the internet back then. Also if a scanner can show all those photos, then can&#39;t it also digitally process the film without actually making the photo look digital ?<br><br>I know that when I take a digital photo that doors at a certain angle are freakishly big, and the color is saturated. When I take a picture of my lawn on film, I get an image as I see it. When I take the same photo on a digital camera, the lawn looks perfectly green and perfect.

The photography was done with the Kodak. Like Destin says in the video, it is a different thought process when you take film images. You look deeper into the subject, you look around the subject and spend more time framing the image. I still have my first camera given to me in 1964 by a photographer, Don Arndt. It is a Brownie Box camera. There are a couple of light leaks, but it still works. A little duct tape and it will be ready for another 60 years of photographs. The one thing I really love is working in the dark room. I never developed color film. But, the things you can bring out, the data that the film stores is amazing. My dad took a photo of a camp fire at night on a sandy beach with ISO 100 film. All you could see in the negative was the fire. But by burning in the background while shading the fire on the photographic paper you could suddenly see boats on the water 200 yards away.

In the crazy part is is the photos that we actually made are the old way of how they used to put the photos on paper it wasn&#39;t no scan and print it was actually the light imprinted it onto the photosensitive paper from the film and you actually focused it and everything by hand and it put it on the paper for you there is no printing and scanning it was light sensitive paper photo paper that took the photo from the actual film onto the paper it was pretty cool actually way less high-tech than the scanner that&#39;s probably like 1970s 1960s and 80s style of developing and making photos but I do black and white at home like I did in class and true black and white film developing and actually putting on the picture paper feels so much more real than even the color film stuff from the 90s that y&#39;all showed on here it is really crazy that a black and white photo taking on film and developing it yourself onto the photo paper on how real it is is it way more real to touch cuz you actually had a physically go from taking the picture to developing the film and the putting it on the photo paper all yourself with lights and everything else in a little dark room it&#39;s pretty cool film is and I can&#39;t believe when that guy said he&#39;s never shot with a film camera before until you work there like I&#39;m 29 and I used film camera way before digital cameras like even in 2005 and 2006 we were still using film camera here at my house", "comment_date": "2022-01-03T00:30:01Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "No one", "comment_text": "I loved to the photos with my father&#39;s Canon AE just like that one ...

Ultimately you can simply use a digital camera and simulate digital film... save the cost of the film and the processing, and the chemical waste at the same time! I have been doing this for years - actually since the late 1990s. I used to shoot film back then and print direct from film and at the same time, produce a set of digital files. This was all done using Fuji Frontier processor/printer machinery. In the early 2000s I moved over to digital and simply simulated the &#39;look&#39; (and grain) using Photoshop. Yes - this is INCLUDING the grain the mid-tones but less or none in the highlights and shadows. Many a fellow-professional has thought that I have used film stock to do this.<br>After all, as your film shows, all you are doing here is digitising film stock originals to a digital file anyway. Believe it or not this is actually what has been happening way back to the mid to early 1990s... it is just that you did not know this when you took your film in to a local/online develop &amp; print shop. The latter simply billed you extra for the digital scan which they made as part of the process anyway! Prior to these sort of printing machines, photo prints were made direct from the film to the print and were not digitised at all.<br>I am intrigued how many who watched are mystified as to how the reference stickers are tallied to the job number... this was sort of shown out of sequence. For those who picked this up, they are stuck on the &#39;job-sheet&#39; of the customer AND the film so that the two can be matched later after the film is process. What was not quite clear in your film is that the sticker for the film is stuck to the film BEFORE the Dip and Dunk processing - i.e. it goes through the chemistry along with the film and is never taken off. Sticking this ref. number onto the film is usually done in the light by retrieving the leader out of the film cassette. You will notice that, with the 120 film, these stickers were temporarily stuck onto the film spindles. This was done as you cannot retrieve the film leader from 120 film (as there isn&#39;t one!) in the light and therefore this has to be done in the dark once the film is removed from the role.<br>Great film btw... it has brought back many &#39;dark&#39;(room) and latent memories.<br>Asante sana...<br>P.s.

When color film and paper came along the lab processes became much more complicated, and the skill of the photographer had to be much higher.

Back in the day, especially as a teen, I was keenly aware that every time I snapped the shutter I was spending about $1 ($0.50 for the film and another $0.50 for the processing and print). It made the photo all the more precious.<br>2) There were a few years there, where consumer film developing would include the option of prints AND digital copies. I hope I&#39;m remembering correctly that the digital copy could be emailed, or received on a floppy disk (I don&#39;t think they were on CD). I don&#39;t remember the resolution being terribly high though, so not to the full capability of the digital printers, even of the day.<br>3) You don&#39;t have to trace back too much before those digital printers, to the days when the prints had to be exposed and developed onto photographic paper, much the way the photo negative was. I did quite a bit of this, with b&amp;w photography in HS. We would go into the dark room, develop the film in a black plastic can (with a spiraling holder, that you rotated to &#39;agitate&#39; the film in the chemicals. Then, you would load the film into a &#39;reverse&#39; camera, which put a light behind the film, magnifying it on to a platform which, after focusing, you would turn the light off, load a piece of photographic paper and do an exposure. Then, into the baths, to develop the positive image. There were a surprising number of representations of this process, in 70&#39;s and 80&#39;s television and movies (likely due to the value as metaphor).", "comment_date": "2021-12-01T21:14:09Z", "likes_count": 10}, {"comment_by": "Cory Dornbusch", "comment_text": "Pentax DSLR have the same experience.

Although I never worked with the same development system, I am familiar with all the processes that we see in this video and worked with the same scanners. So nostalgic to watch. Film truly has a quality that digital photography still cannot match. But I think the systems need a significant redesign. Analog photography requires a lot more technical understanding than using a digital camera, if you want to have control over the end product. So in order for it to be competitive, it needs to become more user friendly. I also think that a higher format than 35mm would be preferable to most. I get the feeling that people who still wanna use film would also like to be able to do large prints. If it&#39;s just for digital use 35mm should be fine.<br>Anyway. Thank you for making this video.

More time/less time equals a push/pull decision by the photographer -- effectivly exposure compensation.  If you detiermine the lab is consistent, request  &quot;NORMAL processing&quot; and no PUSH or PULL. Only push or pull if you think you under or over exposed the film. How do you determine this decision? Request a clip test. They literally cut the tail end of your roll off, process it, and let you see it. Then you decide how to process the rest.

I agree that you have to be much more thoughtful about shooting when you are limited to a roll of film. The magic you miss here is the art of printing. Processing film is just that, processing. I also worked my way through college developing thousands of rolls of film. <br><br>The magic is being in the dark room, exposing the paper to the light of the negative, and slowly watching it transform in front of you. You had to adjust the selective lightness and darkness by dodging. That meant cutting a piece of cardboard in the shape you want and jiggling it over the paper while it was exposed to lighten or darken the image. Color correction was done with thin plastic filters that you layered into the enlarger. If you want to focus on magic, skip this digital stuff and show the magic of printing. <br><br>One way I can compare the process you showed here would be taking the time to record music on tape, make a vinyl record of it, transfer that to a digital file, alter it digitally, and then releasing it digitally.

With an understanding of those characteristics (chiefly: grain, color &amp; tonal limitations of various films), I believe one CAN digitally replicate the look (and &quot;feel&quot;) of an image shot on film effectively enough that - without a great deal of difficulty - one could stump almost anybody over whether a given image was *originally captured on film*.  (Forensic photo analysts would still be able to peg the digital artifacts of the replication in mere moments, of course.)<br><br>- Regarding the experience of SHOOTING on film, however... Well, as you suggest, and as anyone who has ever made photographs on film can attest, virtually NONE of the intangibles affiliated with <b>shooting on film</b> can be replicated digitally.  Physical interaction with the film, chemistry, darkroom, etc; and the psychological impact of the whole experience, like working with a limited number of available exposures, knowing that your images are being physically written to your film by light when you make an exposure... even the nostalgia factor that is inescapably linked to shooting film in the digital age (and so much more).... there is just <b>NO WAY</b> to replicate all of THAT [magical?] stuff.<br>:D", "comment_date": "2021-09-28T20:31:08Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "jai hind", "comment_text": "Relive the old days", "comment_date": "2021-09-28T17:01:51Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Andrew Waite", "comment_text": "<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCxoZlFqzwA&amp;t=33m19s\">33:19</a> that takes me back.

I believe, as another person stated, you are feeling more of a nostalgic feel for film versus a true quality comparison. I grew up using film but completely fell in love with digital photography; I felt that it captured a more true to life image. \r<br>My first experience with digital was when I borrowed my brother in laws 4 megapixel Kodak Easyshare, while on vacation in San Diego. I took a couple hundred photos during the two weeks out there and barely any with my Canon AE1 film camera. I was impressed with not having to continually load another roll of film, as well as the quality of the &quot;Auto exposure and digital processor&quot;... Not to mention the digital telephoto, and the on demand video, without having to switch to a &quot;Camcorder&quot;.\r<br>Look, if you are a really good photographer, you will have no problems with film but if you are an average photographer, film is more of a struggle than a joy. You&#39;ll shoot hundreds of rolls of film and only yield minimal results as far as truly &quot;good/great pictures. Additionally, it is a complete disappointment when you get your photos back and realize that you had the settings/exposure set wrong, and all of your memories are lost, only to be remembered in your minds eye... Which fades over time.  Where as in a digital world, you see the photo instantly and can retake it, if it&#39;s not to your liking.    \r<br>What you may be referring to as a &quot;quality&quot; difference might be the comparison of any image taken with a &quot;smart&quot; phone versus one taken with a good quality 35mm digital camera... There is a Night &amp; Day difference between the two. You will never get the same quality picture on a &quot;smart&quot; phone versus a 35mm digital camera, the image sensor is too small in the phone. \r<br>Again, great videos and enthusiasm but film has passed for a reason, the same reason anything that has gone the analog-to-digital route has passed. \r<br>One last thing, I was wondering why they were not using a &quot;Darkroom Light &quot;in their darkroom. Usually a normal light bulb is enclosed inside/behind a red or green filter of some type. In radiology, several years ago, when we still processed the film manually, by machine, the darkrooms used a &quot;Wratten 6B Filter&quot;-red in color. It did not harm/expose the silver halide crystals on X-ray film. These lights were bright enough to see everything, once your eyes adjusted... usually several seconds to a minute.<br>Also, any  good digital photo can be printer on photo paper, however dye sublimation printing would probably reproduce a more true &quot;film&quot; like image.", "comment_date": "2021-09-09T04:52:53Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Paul Nelson", "comment_text": "You couldn&#39;t get me to go back to film with all the money in the world.", "comment_date": "2021-09-09T04:40:31Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Jeff Rowe", "comment_text": "Film is to visual as records are to audio, we lost something very special when those mediums went away.

It&#39;s not very complicated to explain. Light enters via the lens and hits the emulsion. When enough photons hit one grain of emulsion, the bond between silver and halide (mostly bromide) in a few silverhalide crystals changes. The film &#39;remembers&#39; this photon. If you wait too long with developping, the electrons re-arrange again to their default state and the latent image blurrs.<br>For BW: The film is treated in the developper (eg hydroquinone in Kodak D76). Hydroquinone is a reduction agent. All silverhalide crystals that were excited by a photon get reduced (the Ag+ becomes Ag) and the finely dispersed silver looks black. After enough time (you could up the ISO of a film by extending the time spent in the developper) the developper was removed, the process was stopped by diluted vinegar and the fixing agent (thiosulfate) was poured in. Thio dissolves the unexposed silver halides. After that you had to rinse out all the chemicals for about half an hour.<br>For colour: colour film contains three layers (R, G and B sensitive) and each layer contains two compounds: silverhalide and a specific colour coupler.<br>After exposing in the camera, the film is put in the CN41 developper and the same thing happens as with BW. With just one exception: As the excited crystal oxidizes the developper, the oxidation product of the developper, reacts with the colour coupler inside the layer, thereby forming a cloud of colour. <br>For each lump of metalic silver, there now is a cloud of colour next to a metallic BW image.<br>The next step is BleachFixing, in which the metallic silver is bleached (oxidized) and the un-exposed silverhalide is removed again with thiosulfate. This is a tricky process since you want to oxidize the metallic silver yet you don&#39;t want to ruin the precious colourclouds.. <br>Rinsing and drying &#39;as usual&#39;.<br>Slides were similar. The exposed film is developped in the first developper (eg D76, a BW developper). The oxidised D76 does not react with the colour couplers so you only get a metallic silver BW image. Next the metallic silver is bleached out and the wet film is exposed to an intense light. Then it enters the second developping stage with a colour developper which produces oxidised &#39;waste&#39; that reacts with the colour couplers to form the colour clouds.<br>After the second developper, the bleachfix and rinse baths end the process.<br>Colour couplers and developping agents were better hidden secrets than the nuclear launch codes... Each time Kodak invented a new process, Agfa and Fuji needed to find new couplers, since Kodak had patented its own couplers....<br>The process in reality is a little bit more complicated because the red colour of the carrier is used for something which I forgot (after 30 years)", "comment_date": "2021-08-24T23:23:40Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "frutt56", "comment_text": "You really don&#39;t need the bottle opener.

Is it because the film is able to pickup more photons than a digital camera?

Is the scanner producing better images than a high quality digital camera? And is the scanner touchup software better than the software used for high quality digital photos? I\u2019m not arguing against anything, but I legitimately didn\u2019t see the video present how digitized film images are objectively superior in quality to purely digital images, whereas I did see plenty of subjective claims for superiority of film based on the experience one has while using or processing it.", "comment_date": "2021-07-14T05:13:44Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Alex Vidrine", "comment_text": "what kind of microscope is that? like the model not the type", "comment_date": "2021-07-14T03:28:06Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Ken A", "comment_text": "I recently used my SLR camera that I bought in 1970.

And also my photo processing days at the local photo processing store 31 years ago.  <br><br>My classroom had the dark room with the revolving door.  A big heavy metal tube that easy to turn.  We also had a developing room which we used the hand held developing cylinders of the film and then we had multiple exposure machines and then the print developing station with the four trays of chemicals to get our pictures.   VERY old school processing.  Like you saw in the movie Jaws 2.<br><br>In the store I worked at it was just two machines.  The first to develop the film itself from the rolls.   This machine had a little dark room box just big enough for your hands to slip through tight black velvet curtains (much like one of those medical lab boxes used in virus study).  This box is used if the film is completely rolled up in the canister.  I would use the &quot;dimple&quot; part of the canister to slam it down onto the box base to pop the flat cover off the canister, pull out the rolled film to find the end, slide the end through the slit in the canister (just like manufacturers did to sell the film), put the cover back on the canister, then pull everything out of the box.  Then snip the tapered end off the film and use a special tape (much like car tail lens tape) to tape the film itself to a plastic 8x10 (approx.) card with old style punched holes on the edges for gears to grab and feed it into the processing machine.  About ten minutes later the card and film exit out the back with fully processed film.<br><br>Next came the photo processing with the second machine.  I literally processed one image at a time for each roll of film by inserting the film into a tray, like a microfiche machine, line up the edges of the negative to the hole in the tray, insert the tray into the machine lens which projected the image on a display down INTO the machine which I could view via a tint glass window on the base of the machine near the tray insert.  Once it was lined up I would do a test print to see if color correction of brightness or contrast needing adjusting.  Generally a test print would determine everything for the whole roll of film.  If no adjustments were needed I would pull the tray out, moved the film over to the next frame, re-insert the tray, press the print button and repeat until the roll was completed.  Then the machine would take each photograph printed from a roll of photo paper, cut the paper to size, run the paper through the chemicals and dryer and spit the paper picture out the side of the machine.  It kind of made you feel like an engineer on the starship Enterprise. lol<br><br>If adjustments are needed, then multiple test prints are made to determine when adjustments are right.  Adjustments were made via push buttons on the machine to add or subtract certain colors or brightness or contrast.  Rolls that needed adjustments took longer to process because sometimes some frames of film needed more fine tuning based on what the image was on the negative.   And average roll of film from the time it came into the store to the point of ready to pick up was around 30 minutes or less (sounds like pizza delivery).  Adjustments film would take the full 30 minutes.  But if I was busy and had many rolls to develop I would give the customers at least a full one hour response time because that was what was popular in those days.

It is a physical process that is missing and can be messed up easily if you are not focused.  When shooting the photo you need to be in the moment more. You have to focus your mind on what you want from the photo. You have to adjust the camera itself to get things how you want it. The development is a physical process that if you do it yourself is very rewarding. Finally you end up with a physical image you can hold. A developed photo often actually has a rough texture you can feel with your finger tip when you run your hand over it. You do not get that printing a photo from a computer. I feel that rough physical feeling is part of what changes the look of the photo. It is refracting the image out in many directions depending on the texture, on the angle of those raised parts of the photo. If you take a printed digital photo and compair the same image on traditional photo paper they look different. I think the changes in color, changes in how you view things based on the texture of the paper evokes a feeling inside you. My mom passed away several years ago and I have a few printed photos and some digital photos.

It&#39;s &quot;analog&quot;. Film is to photos/video, what records and high quality reel to reel tapes are to audio/music. These things don&#39;t exist in nature as digital. Sound in nature moves in waves, not set steps made out of 1s and 0s. Our ears evolved to hear natural sound over millenia upon millenia, and our brains evolved to use that information in a certain way. Digital can approximate, and imitate, and the technology had improved, it&#39;s gotten better and better at imitating. But it&#39;s still just that. An imitation. Digital also suffers from compression, and color limitations. The compression can be less and less as technology advances, but it&#39;s still generally there, because as the tech and resolution advances, so do the file sizes get bigger. Meaning you can get super high quality digital photos today, still not the same as pure film, but if you&#39;re seriously into photography you might want to store full blown raw &quot;lossless&quot;(debatable) files. Which are just massive. You need some massive hard drives to be storing lots of those lol. I would argue respectfully that when this lab you visited does the scanning and conversion to digital files step, even though they&#39;re doing it with the utmost care, and using the best equipment available... You&#39;re still losing something of the original image during that conversion. It still ends up digital, which is going to result in at least a little bit of &quot;lost in translation&quot;.. Many would argue that due to all the traditional steps, care, and love they put into the process up until that point, that it&#39;s just as good, or close enough where the human eye can&#39;t really tell the difference.. But there still IS some loss. Obviously if you want to store the photos on your computer, you need this. Computers only speak digital. But if you really want the true lossless experience, you need to go from taking the photos, all the way to the prints, without any digital steps. The old school way of making those photograph prints you can hold in your hand, and show to other people, would be transferred to the final medium optically using an optical enlarger, with the final medium being something most likely along the lines of a chromogenic print medium. This is 100 percent optical from beginning to end with zero digital steps... Basically the way they used to do it before computers or any form of digitizing were even available/possible. While I may be an old fashioned stick in the mud, I would definitely prefer my prints to be non-digital from beginning to end. I&#39;d still get the film scanned, so I could have a digital reference on the computer for ease of storage, or if people who don&#39;t care about this sort of stuff want a copy, since it&#39;s much easier to just email them a file and so on. But when it comes to my original prints that I want to have in physical form, whether just to look at myself, show to other people in person, or make larger prints of, for display purposes (framed, mounted, whatever) I still really prefer direct optical enlargement and no digital anywhere in the &quot;assembly line&quot;. At the end of the day, photos taken on Film, and developed properly before being scanned into a computer, are better. They just are. But no matter how much authenticity there is in the process, the second you scan them into a computer, they just become digital. Those copies you get via email, or special download link on your computer are &quot;film taken, and developed&quot; yes, but they&#39;re still digital photos at the end of the day if they exist on your computer at all. I don&#39;t mean this in a negative (lol) way. I just personally prefer my prints to be non digital at any point. I may be the only person on earth who&#39;s this weird, I don&#39;t know. I didn&#39;t catch it in the video, but does this lab do direct optical prints/enlargements, and then have the digital scans as an option/extra/alternative.. Or are all of their photos sent through the scanners, and the prints you get digitally scanned prior to printing? i.e. No option for optical enlargement and chemical process prints, leaving digital/computers/scanners totally out of the process?", "comment_date": "2021-07-05T13:47:20Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Ryan Kuhn", "comment_text": "You know, those night vision goggles aren\u2019t really that noticeable on their heads.", "comment_date": "2021-07-05T12:30:10Z", "likes_count": 3}, {"comment_by": "Chair", "comment_text": "Sweet home alabama", "comment_date": "2021-07-05T10:51:03Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Markiss Boi", "comment_text": "when you spend your 1st year  learning     about a 35mm  camera  1980s<br>then your big bro buys a camera  and    shows you his pictures   But  ask  why aren&#39;t they in    focus   <br>had to show him about the magic square crystal  see when it goes clear its in focus  Click!

Unlike digital photography where the photographer can take dozens if not hundreds of photos of a particular scene or subject, and then pick out the best photographs, film photographers have to take their time fine-tuning their shots, almost becoming intimate with the scene, because of the limited film in the camera.  Film photographers also have to be aware of the costs of developing films and making prints.  All this adds up to the need to take one&#39;s time composing the picture and the exposure.  In a real sense, digital photography has made us lazy about taking our time with each picture because we can happily snap away dozens of pictures without really putting a lot of thought into the composition of the photographs.

So its AgBr. But is a salt and ionized just like NaCl. There are positive Ag+ ions and negative Br- ions.<br>A photon strikes out an electron from the Br- ion. These electrons got more energy and the are into the so called conduction band. Just like electrons (actually also those in conduction energy band)  in metals these electrons can now move freely inside the crystal.<br>They move to centers of distubance in the crystal. Very good centers of distubance are other atoms like sulfur. <br>(-&gt; a perfect AgBr crystal ist NOT light sensistive. Its nees a disrupted crystal structure and other atoms. These other atoms (e.g. for short time use mercury) make the crystals more sensitive)<br><br>So these places inside the crystal became negativ charged. <br><br>Freely moveable Ag atoms move to this placed and get reduced. <br>These Ag atoms stuck together. More than three form are stable cluster. These are the latent image. A tiny amount of metallic silver consist of few Ag-atoms. <br><br>2. development<br><br>Basically development reduces the AgBr to Ag. The developer agent (D) will be oxydized (DO). <br>The chemical (pseudo) formular is:<br><br>AgBr + H2O + D -&gt; Ag + DO  + HBr.   (HBr is needed for development as well, it makes that the development does not affect unexposed crystals, so its also produced)<br><br>But the magic is this: the developer agents should work only on exposed AgBr crystals. And that is because its an autocatalytic process. It needs silver to start. <br>So everywhere where there is already metallic silver the developer reduce the rest of the crytal proportional to the already existing silver (latent image)<br>So developer amplifies the latent image. <br><br>3. color development<br><br>Additionally to the Ag, color dyes are formed. This is done by using so called color couplers. These are chemical parts of a dye that together with the oxidized developer agent forms a dye. <br>And this is kind of a lucky accident! There is one form of dyes that are usable for color photography. Where a cyan, magenta and yellow dye exist that consist of a chemical substance that is also a good developer. There is only one form of dyes (azo dyes) and one - only one! - substance that is also a good (black and white) developer. p-phenylendiamin. If this substance would not have exist, color photographie would be different. <br>And since this dyes are formed with oxydized developer agent this color image is proportional to the developed silver image.<br><br>This silver image is removed in color films. A so called bleach makes AgBr again from the Ag image, and this AgBr is remove together with the undeveloped ArBr by the fixer. <br>A bleach bath is kind of missleading. A better name would be &quot;development reverser&quot;. <br>And I actually did this! I developed a color film with rodinal b/w. Scanned it. Than I bleached it and did a color development than. Its strange. But it works. In some kind it transforms the behaviour of the bw developer to the color film. But with color shifts. <br><br>There is a lot more to say.

We were working in B&amp;W as color film is a more complex process.  Using the enlarger to expose the final print, I got to crop my photos in a way that I thought they should be printed, rather than having a lab just print the entire frame.  There was one picture I took on color film, the lab did not print because they thought the picture did not come out.  I told them to print it anyway, and sent it back.  It was a single strand of spider silk with a rainbow sheen on it where the sunlight reflected off it..  It looked spectacular when I got the print back.  When I got my first digital scanner, I was able to take those negatives and digitize them, marking off those areas I wanted in the final image.  BTW, there are some colors that film captures better than digital.  I had one picture of a purple flower.  Film captured it, but in the digitized image the flower was blue.<br><br>@ <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCxoZlFqzwA&amp;t=13m03s\">13:03</a> In a B&amp;W lab, film must be kept in the dark, but in the print process, the print paper is only sensitive to blue light, so we had an orange light we could use to see by.  Opening the cans for the film and loading it into the developer frames was done inside a light tight bag.  Color prints are sensitive to all wavelengths, so color labs require total darkness.<br><br>@ <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCxoZlFqzwA&amp;t=34m41s\">34:41</a> I have seen videos that suggest that it&#39;s easier to get high def digital videos from film, and from upscaling digital captures.  For instance, the TV series Andromeda was shot on 35mm film.  The DVDs created from that were intended for DVD players, not 1080p.  It is easier to go back to the original film footage and get good results for the higher resolution than it is to upscale 480p.  BTW I&#39;m a fan of the Andromeda series.  Unfortunately for me, someone decided they needed the money more than I needed the DVD&#39;s.  I spent over $1000.00 US getting those as they came out, and lost it all in one swell foop.  All of those DVDs were first run.  Note, one of the things I loved about those was, you could see the graininess of the film in the video in low light situations, but somehow, it all came together to give a better experience, like watching a movie in the theater.", "comment_date": "2021-06-30T17:41:17Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Daniel Gable", "comment_text": "My first camera was a medium format viewfinder camera that took 620 film.

Who knows what the floor looks like too. What is the resolution of the scanners? Are they recording the grain in the film? If not, how much detail is lost for the sake of file sizes or scanner capabilities? Are they using ICE technology to remove all the lint and scratches from handling film like that?

The batteries being a thing of the past, I long ago designed and built an inverter to that ran on Gates Cyclonic Pure Lead Grid batteries.  I have a Canon something-or-other SLR and the creme&#39;-de-la-Creme, a Kodak Medallist II.<br><br>This camera was designed for the Army AirForce as an aerial recon camera.  The war over, Kodak released the camera to the public.  Dad bought this camera in 1946 for $700 (I have the receipt).  It has the best glass of any camera I&#39;ve ever used.  Unfortunately it uses 620 film.  Same as 120 except for the spools.  For years, I&#39;ve respooled 120 film onto the 620 film spools but no more.  The reason is that the currently manufactured films are basically garbage.  Gone are Fuji Velvia and Kodachrome 32 and 64.

OTOH, the Kodachrome lantern slides that Dad shot in the 40s are still as fresh as if shot today.  Mom was a model.  I have a Kodachrome photo of Mom holding a spray of red roses that Dad took on their 1st anniversary that is still perfect. <br><br>If you think about it a little, it should be obvious why film looks better.  Practically infinite pixel-equivalent resolution, even with Tri-X.  The way the image sensor in a digital fiddles with data multiplexing.

One feels different from another but it depends on what you want. If you want to feel history behind you and nostalgia, yes Model T. If you want to get somewhere fast with hard to remember directions - Tasla. I remember running out of film while failing to capture monumental shots. I remember sitting in the living room, covered in blankets, trying to put undeveloped film into a plastic canister unto a track for developing. There were so many failure points in film. So many frustrations. Fats forward to the digital age. Holy smokes. With a few extra batteries you can shoot thousands of shots. You can shoot in RAW. Your ISO is insane, your low light capabilities are insane. You can save on dual memory cards. After shooting, you can immediately upload your data to a hard drive, a flash drive or a cloud. You&#39;re not afraid of failure as much. Temperature is no problem. Time is no problem. Now, if you were born in the digital age, you view film as something exotic and precious and to a degree it is but if your goal is to capture, to successfully capture good shots, digital has the advantage. One good argument can be made against digital is resolution but that&#39;s a horse of another color or a camera of a different format. They make medium format digital cameras, so the comparison should be between medium format film and medium format digital.

Objectively speaking, digital is superior. You can capture much more information, encode it perfectly, present it perfectly, it won&#39;t degrade with use, it sounds exactly how it should. But there is something about vinyl records that&#39;s almost magical. It&#39;s the same music, but it has noise, it has grain, it has a high noise floor, it differs ever so slightly each time you hear it. It should be perceived as worse, but it&#39;s not. It&#39;s the countless tiny imperfections that give it character. It doesn&#39;t have to be superior, and it isn&#39;t, but it works. Same thing with amplifiers. Compare a modern solid state amp to a tube amp. The tube one has distortion, has noise (sometimes), it audibly messes with the music. But there&#39;s something magical about it.

They showed me pictures from the &#39;golden times&#39; for film. Fascinating to see. All films were melted together in one large film strip, 100s of meters long which traveled through the factory with a system consisting of rollers. Running through the developer baths etc. At highest point they had 8 lines running 16 hours a day producing kilometers of film. Also the printing process was done on a long ribant (if that&#39;s the correct translation) several 100s meters long. At the end of the production line there were these cutter machines which could cut around 20 photos per second if I remember correctly before the ladies put them in the bags to be shipped out. It rarely happened that the film broke which caused a production stop and sometimes resulted in unusable film, but it happened.

It was formerly owned by a photographer from Life magazine. It was completely manual. You had to set the F stop, aperture, focus all by hand (or eye). No previews. You had to work from memory and experience based on the type of film (speed, grain, manufacturer, developer, etc.). (For example Fuji film had slightly different characteristics than Kodak film and different photographers leaned toward one or another based on personal bias.) The body of the camera was steel. The internals were dampened. You could drop it from shoulder height onto cement and (probably) wouldn&#39;t kill the body, though the lens might not survive. It was made for the field for professional photojournalists, and you can still get lenses and film for it.<br><br>My father taught me how to quickly &quot;bracket&quot; shots. That is, to take a picture with slightly more and less exposures so when the film came back from the lab, you could choose the best of the three. Likewise, rather than spend money developing a roll into slides or prints, he taught me to get &quot;contact sheets&quot; developed where the negatives were all printed out on one large sheet and then you would mark that up and tell the developer to only develop the ones you wanted.<br><br>In short. It was a process that could take weeks. When digital cameras came out I jumped. Instant gratification. Virtually unlimited options in post and the tools kept getting better every year. <br><br>The net? Coming from analog to digital gave me skills to frame and focus and be more &quot;careful &quot;about which shots I take and which I leave behind.

Little manipulations, like pulling the developing image out of the tray and blowing hot breath on a part of the print that wasn&#39;t coming in dark enough (heat accelerated development).  Or the worst case scenario, when  you&#39;d overexposed the print and it started coming in way too fast.  Generally, you&#39;d just pull it out at that point (why waste chemicals on a dead print?).<br><br>All that said, I don&#39;t shoot film any more.  Just like I don&#39;t use tape any more for recording.  You come to realize, at a point, that you&#39;ve gained so much more than you&#39;ve lost, particularly if you&#39;re doing it for money.  How many shots did I lose rewinding the film into the cart before I could pop it out and thread another one?  Oh, so many.  How many shots do I nail today because I can bang off 10 fps?  Plenty.  Watching someone&#39;s smile develop until BAM--there it is, the perfect maximum extension of an expression.<br><br>So, yes.  I can see the nostalgia.  Hey, I have a wall of vinyl...I get it.  I like still putting my hands on records I bought in college, half of which never made the leap to digital.  But is vinyl objectively better?  No.  Not by a country mile.  And is film objectively better?  No, by the same standard.  I bought my first CD player in 1983, and even with the relatively rough converters compared to today, I will never forget the first time I heard a digital classical recording on it.  Free of clicks, pops...no noise but the air moving in the room.  It was like a veil had been lifted.  And now, with modern AD/DA converters?  It&#39;s just even more superior.<br><br>The one weakness of current digital cameras is, ironically, the S L O W rate at which the manufacturers are willing to add features.  And the reason for that, at least according to a Canon engineer I had a long conversation with, is the general conservatism of the leading companies.  This engineer (only recently retired) moved to the medical division because, in his words, there was more opportunity to advance imaging improvements that would be subjected to years of alpha/beta testing in consumer/pro photography markets.<br><br>I guess the only other thing I miss about printing in analog world was darkroom time.  It was dark in there.  And there were girls.

Building 59 had a couple of completely dark floors where the experimental film coating machine rooms were located.  <br><br>Part of my job there as a technician was to retrieve experimental film emulsions from a huge refrigerated area, and then deliver them on a cart to various experimental film coating machine technicians located in the completely dark floors of building 59.  The hallways leading to those rooms were also completely dark, so it took some doing to navigate one&#39;s way to various specific experimental coating machine rooms.  <br><br>Once the experimental films were coated with emulsion, I would then take them back to my lab for subsequent processing and testing (via sensitometric, densitometric, pressure, spectral sensitivity, accelerated aging, and picture tests).  We would then compare our new, improved experimental films to current Kodak product, as well as to our competitors.  It was definitely interesting work.", "comment_date": "2021-06-21T12:27:56Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Oliver Murray", "comment_text": "This is like a audiophile trying to tell you why vinyl is better :p it&#39;s not..

If you think film is a good feeling compared to digital, hand developing (which isn&#39;t really practical with color) is even better!  With black and white, you can make adjustments that impact the outcome <i>during</i> development.  It&#39;s absolutely fascinating.<br><br>Second, my personal take is, digital is good if all you want to do is remember something or record something.  It&#39;s also good when you <i>have</i> to get a good picture, because you can take a ton of shots and pick the best.  It&#39;s a good industrial process for recording moments.  Film is good for <i>fine art</i> photography.  It&#39;s good when your goal is to produce art rather than merely recording moments or getting the perfect shot.  With film, you have to accept that you probably aren&#39;t going to get the perfect shot, but because you have limited resources, you still have to make the absolute most of it.  In digital photos imperfections can be viewed as laziness, but with film they are character.  And, when you <i>do</i> get a perfect picture on film it is so much more valuable, not necessarily in money, but in sentimental value.  One of my best pictures of all time is a black and white I took from a bridge going over railroad tracks.  I was trying to get a scenic picture of some mountains in Alaska, and the bridge was the best view.  The mountain pictures turned out terrible, as usual (too much dust in the air), but after snapping several pictures of the mountains, I looked down at the tracks, and on a whim took two pictures, one straight, and one with the tracks going through the frame diagonally.  Those black and white images of the tracks were <i>absolutely perfect,</i> with good depth (despite the tracks only being a few inches high), just the right amount of reflection, perfect shadows, and flawless focus.  They were the only frames on that entire roll of film worth keeping, and they are still some of my favorites.  (I took those pictures as part of a black and white photography class, and everyone was really impressed, and I didn&#39;t even realize those would be the star of that shoot, until I developed them and saw what I had done.  I used one of those pictures in the final portfolio for the course, and it helped earn me an A in the course.)<br><br>I realize not everyone will agree with me, and I&#39;ve seen digital photographs worthy of classification as fine art, but film photography feels to me more like a medium of fine art than digital photography, <i>because</i> it is higher risk.<br><br>On a side note, my favorite film ever was some 90mm film some other student was using in the blackroom when I was taking that course.  Larger film gets higher resolution, and while 35mm film has pretty decent resolution (especially if you can manage ISO 100, which has much smaller grain size), 90mm film projected on the same page size is <i>so clear.</i>  That guy&#39;s photos were so gorgeous, because they were so smooth and clear!

The sulfer grain looks granular, not noisy. <br>- In some photo&#39;s it&#39;s the on camera flash that gives it an old-school look. <br>- You&#39;ve got all the vintage (sometimes cheap) lens effects, like flares, aberration, colorbleeding etc. You can use a vintage lens on a modern camera.<br>- The color shifts from the actual filmtape make for a filmlook. This is easy reproducible in a photo editing software.<br>- And you&#39;ve got all the ways in which the development or the exposure of the photograph to sunlight shifts or washes colors. You can have one color wash out while the others stay good. Or maybe you dropped some water on the photo somewhere. <br><br>It&#39;s true that a combination of all these things happen just by using film.

Working by feel, you pop the film canister open with the can opener, spool the film onto the reel, cut the tape fastening the end to the original film spool, and pop the reel into the tank. Then you put on the light tight lid, take everything out, and proceed with developing the film. I started developing film in grade 10, and continued to do so until I shifted to digital.

In hindsight that was obviously incorrect and it precipitated the collapse of the company which largely brought the city down with it. I live in Chicago now but have a lot of pride still for my hometown - despite it admittedly being a bit of a shithole these days - and I sing its praises every chance I get as it was an incredibly important city historically, with Kodak chief among the accomplishments as well as Xerox and their photocopier!<br><br>Seeing this video, in 2021, discussing with excitement and wonder the technology that was a cornerstone of my hometown for a century before it was largely forgotten about, and the thousands of commenters fascinated by it as well, is making me bizarrely emotional.

I can imagin how much more meaningful each photo will be as it wont be as discarded as a digital photo. Hopefully i can find someone near me in Australia that still processes film.

Today, I was going through some things and I found some prints that I shot when I lived in Colorado back in the early 90s. That feeling you described about shooting with film being &quot;special&quot; was a reality. As I looked at the prints, it seemed like time slowed down and I was taken back to that time, to the moment I took them, not just the image, but the feeling of being there once again. Here is a short story about one of the images: I was hiking up in the Rocky Mountain National Park (near Estes Park) and I had my camera. I took several pictures. About 3 miles into my hike, I came across a nice little stream with some granite boulders in it. I only had 1 exposure left on the roll and no spares. I wanted to do a long exposure to make the water look like it was &quot;painted&quot; into the picture (creating motion). Usually, I would &quot;bracket&quot; the shot (take 3 exposures with 2 shots one setting above and below what I thought it should be and 1 shot at the settings I thought it should be) but, I only had 1 shot left on the roll. So, I set my shutter speed to a slightly longer exposure and my F stop so less light would hit the film, so the long exposure wouldn&#39;t wash out the image. It came out perfect. I was so proud of that picture... Today, people don&#39;t understand why it is such a big deal. You can just &quot;photoshop&quot; it or (with digital cameras) take 4 or 5 shots and pick the one you like the best, and delete the rest. It&#39;s kind of like hunting with a bow or a muzzle loader compared to a semi-automatic rifle. You only get one chance, so you need to get it right the first time.

I can remember how the light came through the curtains and was just about perfect. Cameras themselves can bring out feelings. My wife has an old Minolta Hi-matic 9 camera that belonged to her grandfather. This past year we learned that her step-dad had terminal cancer and our visit at Christmas was likely the last time we would see him. I had the camera repaired and took it with us.

Maybe we both can learn something. <br><br>&#39;Taking a film photo seems more meaningful.&#39;<br>I think digital photos can feel equally meaningful. You just need to take your time. Sure, with film there&#39;s actual consequences of losing a quarter each time you open the shutter. But it might make it so you miss more moments. <br>It&#39;s like saying that typing on a typewriter feels more meaningful. Sure, you&#39;re right that some people feel that way, but the annoyance of using white out, or getting the keys jammed isn&#39;t worth it for most people. It seems like nostalgia plays a big role in people&#39;s enjoyment of film. The film photos feel like a distant memory, because it&#39;s what your earliest memories were shot on. It looks old because your old photos use film. Why is that wonderful or interesting to you? But the point more in need of justification, why does that bother me so much? <br><br>I guess I have a problem with the whole traditionalist mentality of &quot;past good, now bad&quot; which I&#39;m probably overextending that dislike to trivial extremes (like your film intro). <br>The world today is better in so many ways- like Steven Pinker often talks about. But still, people think the past is better. Sure childhood is better than adulthood. Adult problems aren&#39;t fun. Different things aren&#39;t as fun when you&#39;re older (unless you&#39;re on acid). <br>But when people advocate a return to the past, like Uncle Rico, to the detriment of those who live in the present-- I just slap my head. I&#39;m sure your (great?) grandparents thought washing clothes or dishes by hand was more meaningful. It&#39;s just a waste of water, and time that could be spent with family. <br>In the end everyone gets to decide what they want to do with their time.

For instance, I can set my camera, Canon 90D, to show me live SLR on the screen, then I can zoom the screen in much tighter to refine the focus.  None of my film photos have ever held this level of sharpness and clarity.  I get what you are talking about, and I love the organic feel to film photography, but I also love a great sharp and clear photograph.  BTW, my first 35mm camera was an Argus C3 Rangefinder.

First of all. If you take photos with a large format camera, the film is quite big and the output of the camera will be like a digital camera with a 300 Mpixel resolution. You can buy a large format film camera, but today, you still can&#39;t buy a digital camera with that resolution. And if you get back to the good old 135-format (classic filmrolls) there is something strange when compairing film to digital. A photo taken on film can be enlarged a huge lot without looking bad, and when enlarging a digital photo a bit the result just looks very sad and no good at all.<br>A tip for your next video if continuing on the film theme. The E6 and the C41 color process (film positive aka dia vs color negative) are compatible. Hence, its possible to make color negatives out of a positive film and vice versa. Its really fun! And. Strange. By the way. Kodacrome positive film is not compatible, and the process is as far as I know still secret and the last kodacrome positives where developed in 2008.<br>Another fun story: I cleaned out a garage in 2010, found a black and white film roll, undeveloped. Realized that that Ilford film type was last made in 1986 and probably spent its days in room temperature and in a drawer. Tried out to develop this 25 years (or more!) old film, added some possassium bromide to the developer, and YES it worked, got a lot of good pictures out of a film that had been just laying for decades.

Nothing about it was automatic, so I had to learn about f stops and exposure time along with the trade offs between film speed vs grain in the final image. I shot mostly in black and white because I could develop and print photos at home and the film was cheap. The learning curve to produce great photos with film and develop prints is fairly steep. Shoot the photos, develop them and then print. You don&#39;t get a second chance if you make a mistake. Consequently, you take more time to adjust the camera settings, compose the shot and press the shutter. It&#39;s both exciting and terrifying to pull the developed film from the can, especially if the photos are of a once in a lifetime event. After awhile, all of the technical details become second nature and you concentrate on making the best composition. If I hadn&#39;t learned all that techy stuff, I don&#39;t think I would be making great photos with my digital SLR. <br><br>If you want the experience of shooting with film on a digital camera, try this. First, if you have a DSLR, put it in manual mode. See what happens with various f stop, exposure time settings, and ISO settings. Limit yourself to taking just 36 or 24 exposures, as you would with film. Finally, don&#39;t even think about looking at the preview of the pictures as you take them. Wait a few days before loading the photos onto your computer. Chances are you won&#39;t have many &quot;keepers&quot; unless you already have a good feel for the technical side of photography. Look at the metadata stored with each image to see what the camera settings were. They hold the clues to why a photo turned out great or was a dud. If you keep practicing, you&#39;ll gain a much better understanding of how to set the camera and compose a photo to get extreme focus for some situations or a soft blurred background for others. You&#39;ll get a feeling for how light works with shadows and how to capture skies without blowing out the highlights. You will find that you actually have more &quot;keepers&quot; while taking fewer photographs. <br><br>Smartphones and digital cameras are great, but their highly automated modes leave little more to the user than to push a button.", "comment_date": "2021-06-15T23:05:59Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Zukaro Travon", "comment_text": "Regardless of if film or digital gives a better picture (I believe digital can give a better picture in theory, and that it&#39;s already equivalent quality wise with film) the thing is the quality isn&#39;t really what&#39;s important, at least not for things you&#39;re taking pictures of with film.

The film was so full of silver that the off cuts at the beginning and end of each production run were saved, and then eventually sold to recycling companies that would chemically removed the silver from the film and do so profitably. If you look at historical silver pricing, you will find a huge spike in November of 1979. The Hunt brothers had come up with a scheme to try to &quot;corner the market&quot; on silver, and I remember the owners of the company I worked for literally fearing that they were going to go bankrupt, because we had fixed price contracts with our customers, but the price of film went up drastically. The scheme ultimately failed. I ended up working part time during college at a COM company in San Antonio.

Thank you so much for making this video! The joy you exude is a breath of fresh air. I took a semester of traditional darkroom photography in college and immediately fell in love! I learned how to do the process entirely by hand from rolling, shooting, and developing film to working with enlargers in the darkroom to manually moving the photopaper through the developer, stopper, fixer, and rinse baths. Everything I did was in monochrome which I absolutely love the look and feel of! It&#39;s my favorite type of film by far.<br>I love nothing more than taking a photo of my friends and knowing that from start to finish, I did every little step! Handing them a print that I made (and they modeled for) is such a wonderful feeling. The process, results, and amount of control is something that digital can never touch. Isn&#39;t it odd how with modern software you can be so exact and calculated with the entire photography process but working with film and chemicals by hand yields the best and most precise results? My dream is to have my own darkroom in my house because I really love developing the film and prints myself manually, but until then I&#39;ve been shooting polaroid so I can still get the feeling of working in film. <br>Watching this video was so fun! You did an excellent job highlighting the process and it definitely made me laugh when you were so interested in the mechanical operation of the film developing machine! I love all your videos but this one is especially fascinating to me. I now feel the desire to get out my dad&#39;s old 35mm film camera that I first learned on. Thanks again!<br><br>P.S. If you enjoyed learning about the chemical process behind color film, check out the chemical engineering behind making instant film like polaroid.

I went to photography school when cameras were all, pure mechanical machines. you adjusted the shutter speed, the aperture, the asa/iso( the sensitivity of the film to light)(and if the camera did not have a light meter, then you went and bought one, or , from experience, knew how to adjust the camera settings to the light conditions. I bought my first camera while in the service, it was a Nikon F1 in 1970 for $250.00. the Nikon F6, there latest(mechanical camera) now costs $6500.00. I own an F5, and if there are any Nikon owners reading this they will attest to  the fact that these cameras are built like tanks; they are designed to be USED. I have literally ran miles of film through this camera, and like the Timex commercial, &quot;takes a licking, and keep on ticking&quot;. Why is film different? If you have to place a negative under a microscope, you immediately understand. there is literally millions of light sensitive, light adsorbing &quot;microscopic&quot; particles side by side, on top of each other, overlapping each other; whereas a digital camera has round, discrete sensors parked beside each other, thus inherently creating gaps in the image. And what used to be called grain, is now called noise. And grain was magic when used properly in black and white film processing, and printing. And in the video, the nitrogen(bursts) in the lab is used to agitate the chemicals from &quot;resting&quot; on a piece of film, otherwise uneven development. The one other thing not directly pointed out is the precise temperature control of the chemicals, sometimes a 1 degree variation will cause a shift in the colors, where as b/w normally is processed between 68 to 72, and you could push and pull film development(the zone system Ansel Adams stuff)(usually employed on large format, view camera platforms). Lastly, shooting with film, and shooting with a mechanical camera will make you a better &quot;image&quot; maker. It will slow you down; it will make you evaluate the scene, and will allow you to embark on a decision that will determine the final image, and not the camera&#39;s P setting. Thank you for making this video. It was a trip down memory lane, regarding the lab, and got me excited that dinosaurs(film) still roam the earth. Maybe it is time to run a few more miles of film through my F5, now that I know where to go. I liked the owner.

And that image exists in your mind, until you get the film developed, and find out how near or how far the image really is from the photo you thought you took. And guess what? The more time you spend learning to use your camera, the closer the images really are to what you thought you created. In time, you get to the point where you press the button, and you know what you got. With experience, you really get that feeling of creation, at the press of a button.

Not all film is high quality enough to deserve a drum scan, but drum scanners (like film vs digital) really take the quality to the next level.

The only problem is that they don&#39;t have an infrared scan, which is an extra colour channel that tells you where all dirt and scratches are (and so automatically removes them from you like the photoshop heal tool).

Thanks for the trip down memory lane! I can still remember the hand movements to scan and adjust film on a Fuji Frontier console. The specialized keyboard makes color corrections so fast, no software can match that. An experienced tech can rip through a roll of film in less than a minute. I scanned so many slides on that machine. It could have been the operators fault, but I could never get perfect colors on that scanner from Velvia slides. <br><br>The minilab film developer and printer were really cool machines. They pulled the film/paper through rollers through each chemical at a constant speed. The time in each tank was determined by the depth of the tank. Each week we had to pull each rack out of the tanks and clean them to keep them from accumulating crystals and other debris that would scratch film. <br><br>We had the pinnacle of Fuji printers, the Frontier 570. IIRC, it could print a 4x6 in about one minute, and 36 prints (one roll) in about two minutes total. If we had nothing else pending, we could develop and print a roll in under 15 minutes. That thing was a beast (temperamental, too). <br><br>We ran control strips every morning and had a color measuring machine to analyze them. We didn\u2019t start printing if the numbers were out of range, and if they weren\u2019t it could require draining the tanks from the machines and refilling the chemistry.

No objective comparisons...digital to film... at all.<br><br>As an old person I remember my grandmother taking 2&quot;x2&quot; B&amp;W photos with a little Kodak box camera...first sending the whole camera in for processing. Since then I have gone through nearly all the technologies...various Kodak color types; early cheap Sears film that couldn&#39;t hold color; various kinds of color cameras ending with the SLRs; various lens types and mounts; different sensitivities (the faster the film the grainier...B&amp;W much faster and less grainy than color); adjusting shutter speed and aperture for depth of field... and then digital with more and more pixel resolution. <br><br>There was an epoch when all the pro photographers who would never leave film all left it. I&#39;m convinced it was a resolution issue. Digital resolution caught up with and exceeded film resolution; digital sensitivity caught up and exceeded film sensitivity; digital color caught up and exceeded film definition; and cameras began to fire off 10 shots in a burst so you didn&#39;t get things like eyes shut or camera steadiness issues. <br><br>And yet in watching this, everything was subjective. I at least expected to see the objective measure of film grain vs pixels. <br><br>As an old person, digital music and digital photography are superior without question.

I don&#39;t know how much time we left on this earth before Jesus comes, but I want all of us to be ready when He does. Let&#39;s leave these things of this world behind for in scripture it says in Matthew 24:35 that heaven and earth will disappear, but my words will never disappear. &quot; Also in 2 corinthians 4:18&quot; So we fix our eyes not on what is seen, but on what is unseen, since what is seen is temporary, but what is unseen is eternal.&quot; Time is so short. And I always say this&quot; I want all of us to be saved. &quot; Jesus is coming back soon.&quot; with tears in my eyes I love you guys. Let&#39;s take Jesus and His words seriously in these time were in. I know the road isn&#39;t easy because there are so much distractions and temptations in this life. But through prayer and fasting we can overcome them. I&#39;m not\u00a0forcing anything on anybody or even forcing to do something they don&#39;t. But if you were to see your mother about to get hit by a big truck, you would do everything to try and save her and if you didn&#39;t, it show that you don&#39;t love her. So I do the same thing for us about the wrath of God that is to come. I don&#39;t want anyone I love, know/don&#39;t know or even those who hate or dislike me to face such things. Because I know every soul is precious to God and are valuable to Him. Because before we were born He knew us, He knitted us in our mother&#39;s womb, He called us to be His children . His love for us is so great and so strong, it&#39;s beyond human comprehension, that even the angels in heaven don&#39;t understand it. So I want to tell you it&#39;s time to get ready, time to prepare ourselves for the Second Coming of Christ, for the trails and tribulations and for the rapture. As you can see, so many people have turned away from God. The world has become so immoral, wicked, disgusting and violent. Killing people without any care or heart. And that shows that the love of God is growing cold in the hearts of people. Please be ready friends, for when the Son of Man comes. Time is running out. Let&#39;s not leave this world with regrets. Because I tell you this, my biggest regret is not knowing Jesus Christ earlier. I love you Guys and Jesus loves you too, that&#39;s why He didn&#39;t think twice about dying on the Cross for us, knowing that we may not even love Him back. Please take what was said today in consideration because ready or not Jesus Christ is coming back believe it or not Jesus is coming back. <br><br>How to be saved?

That&#39;s like insisting a mini van going 100 is slower than a lowrider going 100 simply because the height makes the relative road changes look different so it &quot;feels&quot; not as fast.  Science cares about your speedometer, not your feels.  Much of your &quot;feels&quot; comes from personal nostalgia.  Someone who is 14 might look at the old timey film photos and think the look awful because they don&#39;t harken him back to his day so of youth.  I was a skateboard videographer and these days the filming styles are different and I don&#39;t like them.  I prefer the techniques I grew up with.  They are my comfort zone.

You have no idea how nostalgic this made me. I started working in a lab when I was 13 in 1980. I started as the dip and dunk guy. I spent literally half my life in the dark. By the time I was 16, photographers were sending me their films from all over the country because I had an eye for printing (a Durst 501) which was the very rough draft of the Frontier colour correction system but no digital involved. I&#39;ve worked on Frontiers but later in life around 2002 in a super automated Agfa lab. This machine could scan and print direct, but also send digital files to my workstation where I did specialized stuff on Photoshop for select clients. I&#39;ve done tons of B&amp;W darkroom work, worked with ancient as well as state of the art equipment. If I look at a negative still today, I see the image as if it is positive. My brain just makes an adjustment somehow lol. My daughter now has my old film cameras but it&#39;s hard to find film or guys processing anymore around these parts. Seeing that dip and dunk machine just brought back the smells, the sound of that mechanism, the nitrogen bubbles the awesome total darkness, even the weird slippery feel of the developer and the smell of each mixing part.

I noticed in a closer look at <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCxoZlFqzwA&amp;t=8m37s\">8:37</a> that the stickers Erin is placing there are being placed such that they\u2019re hanging off the edge.

Or do they get transferred to some interim place, and then transfer again where Heather talks about it, at <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCxoZlFqzwA&amp;t=22m45s\">22:45</a>?

This helps to embed that memory and gives us a real sense of achievement when we see that our shots were successful.

It did only do at most 2 at a time though so throughput would be a lot less than this unit. Also we didn&#39;t have a fancy dark room, if the film jammed in the cartridge we&#39;d have a black box that you&#39;d put the film and a replacement cartridge inside. You&#39;d then break the stuck cartridge, extract the film and attach it to the replacement unit which could be opened up to hook the film inside then closed and spun to roll it up neat.

Starting from a specific event as a kid, I eventually earned a science degree and made my first career in photography. I was never any good with a camera, but spent 20 years as the head of the technical department in a large professional lab. Aside from college, I have been trained by, and worked closely with, Eastman Kodak, Fuji, Fuji- Hunt, Bremson Data, Lucht Engineering, Pako, Kreonite, and many more. Photographic labs are much more complex and precise than most people understand. It is not just chemistry, it&#39;s mechanical, pneumatic, electrical, electronic, plumbing, computers, temperature control, effluent processing, and much, much, much more, in addition to the business aspect. Everything had to be very precise. There are very narrow parameters for everything from temperature control to replenishment of the chemistry to even seemingly little things like the nitrogen gas burst agitation. Precision testing with control strips and charting the results were a huge deal to keep us on track. We used a Macbeth transmission/reflection densitometer to read all the control strips. That thing sat prominently on my desk my whole career. I was &quot;married&quot; to &quot;Shirley&quot; for decades, although &quot;Shirley&quot; may not be around anymore, that was more of the printing side, although that, in some form, may still be used to calibrate their monitors and scanners.\r<br>Going thru college, I was always amazed how much science there is in the photographic process and amazed how my (old school) SCUBA lessons and even astronomy lessons fit in. It is all science - it all interrelates. \r<br> I still have all my darkroom and camera gear, a deep freezer full of film, paper, and chemistry. Some day I might just set all that stuff up and show my kids &quot;real&quot; photography. You should try some B&amp;W printing sometime. Watching an image form on a sheet of paper is still facinating - and magical. Yeah, I am one with  &quot;fixer in my blood&quot;. <br>Great show, thanks.<br>One memory: I purchased a night vision headset for one of our film processors to evaluate. She was a black lady who was larger than life and everyone loved her, and her big Afro, dearly. She came out of the back of the film room one day complaining she smelled smoke, still wearing the headset, trailing a plume of smoke. The smoke she smelled was the battery pack igniting her hair.

Today even a basic entry model surpasses most analogue 35 mm cameras. For me this process of &quot;analogue&quot; makes sense only if the print is made through the analogue process. No scanning, no digital technology involved. If you want to view your image on monitor, which itself gets the signal from a digital source, you might as well make the whole process digital.<br><br>Shooting film and viewing the results on monitors, most of which are not calibrated at all, kind of misses the point. Wherease if you have a real physical piece of photographic paper with a &quot;print&quot; on it, you have a physical piece of matter that came to be by fully analogue technique, without any digital steps involved. The &quot;print&quot; might look different based on the specific lightning contidions when you look at it, but &quot;prints&quot; made using the analogue process with identical settings yield identical physical photographs.<br><br>I shot hundreds of film rolls. I did not want to go digital because of high cost and bad quality of early digital cameras. I was forced to go digital, when the last Photolab where they used a fully analogue process closed. I had to send my rolls to another Photolab which used a digital process, much like shown in this video. The developed the film, scanned it and then printed copies. It was afwul! The colors changed, contrast was artificially blowed up with loss of details in the highlight and shadows. On a 10 x 15 cm print I was able to see individual pixels without any magnifying tools. The old system was an Agfa machine, the new one was Fuji, maybe exactly the same machines as seen in this video.<br><br>For this reason, I went digital, my first DSLR being the EOS 30D. It took me pretty long to adapt to the smaller APS-C format, as I was used to full frame from my Praktica VLC3. The last time I shot a film was 6. 5. 2019.

The one difference between film and digital that you touched on but didn&#39;t actually talk about is that with film you had a limited number of images to use.  You could not take 20 or 30 pictures of the same subject and then delete the bad ones.  this made you think about the shot before you tripped the shudder.  Composition, lighting, exposer and the overall look (presence, atmosphere, feel, this piece has a lot of different descriptions) became more important because, many times, there was no chance to re-take the picture. imagine a trip to the Bahamas, if that picture wasn&#39;t quite right, what was the likelihood that you could go back and try again?  As a pro photographer, this was one of the reasons I disliked shooting weddings.  Digital photography leads to paying less attention to this kind of detail, if it&#39;s not right, just try again.  It also leads to far less disappointment as you know you have the shot before you move on.  I think that this is part of the different experience you get from film, the anticipation and either thrill of seeing the perfect picture once it&#39;s developed, or disappointment and conscious trouble shooting to figure out why it&#39;s not what you wanted, and what to do to not have that problem on the next roll.<br>Sorry, this is a longer post than I meant, but as I have been a photographer for around 50 (okay, I did the math and I got my first camera 43 years ago) and lived through the digital revolution, I guess I have an opinion or two (as well as being an &quot;old coot&quot; &quot;get off my lawn ya whipper-snapper&quot;)<br>Anyway, Loved this video (love them all, this one just made me very nostalgic).

Like, you know the &quot;rules&quot; (guidelines?) of photography.  The images you shared are really well done, you&#39;re not just pointing and shooting snaps, these images have a lot of thought put behind them.  I was not expecting the big science guy to also be very artistic when it comes to photography.<br>That image of the street in New Orleans, nothing seems all too spectacular about it, but that offset where it goes off to the left makes a world of difference.<br>UGH, and that trumpet player, that is a gorgeous shot.  There&#39;s this juxtaposition of joy and melancholy because everything is all a little gray, even the trumpet player wears some muted tones, there&#39;s people around to listen to him, but they aren&#39;t very actively engaging with him, and yet he still plays because he loves making music, it brings him joy.  Beautiful.<br>The image of the statue of Blind Justice, like, technically not all too in the rule of thirds, but you can then interpenetrate that she is in the center of the world around and reflected on her and she keeps it balanced.<br>The street corner where you got the whole building and both vanishing points far to the left and on the right, what a trippy looking image, it&#39;s unnatural, but that&#39;s something photography can absolutely do because it only has the one eye, that&#39;s all it knows.  With the composition, it&#39;s wonderfully balanced, and there&#39;s great movement despite it being a static thing because my eye wants to look everywhere.  I want to see what&#39;s way down the street, I want to look at the painting of the dogs, I want to see what&#39;s down the other street, and then I want to see the point where the building meets the sky, it&#39;s just wonderful.<br>The van at the corner of St. Peter, man, what a story that&#39;s going on there.  There&#39;s so much to look at, so much to wonder what&#39;s all happening, and what&#39;s happened to this city and the people that inhabit it.  Beautifully contrast in lighting, too.<br>Come on man, you&#39;ve got a knack for photography.  I should have never really doubted your eye, you make videos all the time, you understand the technology and what will make for a good image, but to actively make art out of the photos you took on a trip rather than just take tourism snaps, it&#39;s really awesome.

There were a number of problems. If the film was agitated too much it would result in over-exposed negatives, which could be ascertained through the use of test strips.

When I was growing up all through my young life I can recall this dark and somewhat mysterious room in our basement called &quot;The Darkroom&quot; it was filled with all sorts of mechanical things and tubs and sinks and the most unique set smells. It seemed truly magical that one day my Dad was out with us taking photos or home movies and just days or even hours later there they would all be on proof sheets. Mom and Dad and every so often the kiddos would choose the best ones. Off he would go and a few snacks and play time later, Boom, there they were all still holding the magical smells and the warmth on the print dryer still clinging to the prints. Dad had all sorts of different papers that had all sorts of different textures and different glosses from supper shiny to the really flat and some with a deep texture to them. Those papers we were really careful with because of the price. As I grew I started becoming more interested and would join him and got to understand much more of the process. One of my favorite parts was working with the &quot;Inlarger&quot;. You could be a part of bringing a photo to life. I learned how to time the image and how to correct for some mistakes by shadowing with all sorts of tools and even how to hold the negative at angles to change the focal plane of the print to enhance and certain qualities of the photo. Then off to watch the development of the photo itself. Watch the image start to form almost out of no where. It was wonderful to watch. Dad had 14 cameras and a huge selection of lens options to go with them. He would take time to explain what each did and oversee as I grew to have some experience. I can still remember the summer I ask if I could take a camera and use it for a project. He ask about the project and why I wanted a certain camera to accomplish a look I was after. After what seemed like a two hour discussion, he said sure son use what you like. It wasn&#39;t until much later in life did I understand the smile on his face. I guess after countless hours of training and working with different cameras and tools in printing we ended up at the one point it time when he knew I understood, not only the value of the camera in my hand, but also the techniques I had in mind to provided a certain result. I guess it was a point of passage for he and I. He was proud to see one of his sons first real accomplishments. I come from a family of 6 kids. My father was a Architect. He had a Doctorate in Architecture and Masteres in Mechanical engineering. He was a pretty smart fella. I still have that old enlarger and a few of the more collectible cameras he had in his collection. <br>So Thank You!

It&#39;s a niche.\r<br>I&#39;m at my 30s, and I grew up in Russia, so, believe me, I had all the analogue stuff. Vinyls, black-and-white tv, tapes, video taped, and of course film cameras.\r<br>\r<br>I don\u2019t feel it. Really I don\u2019t. I can see how excited and passionate Destin is. I know few people with that &quot;film feeling&quot; but I personally don\u2019t get it. I see all this film stuff as unnecessary complications and this IS what it is now. You have limited amount of shots, you\u2019re limited with same ISO, you have way fewer things done automatically for you. And after that you need to get to the lab, process it and then see result. I find it frustrating. Digital is great! It makes you to be determined on the process itself, not thinking about all this stuff surrounding film process.\r<br>\r<br>I\u2019m all digital. I read my books on screen since I got my first e-Ink reader. And I shoot digitally since I got my first digital camera. I listen to my music digitally. I communicate with people digitally. I think the digital world is underestimated in our days. Because we have everything digitalized. But try to deconstruct it. Try to see the whole process that the digital camera does to capture the light and make it a picture on the screen. I can assure you the process of encoding things into digital representation is fascinating. It is the miracle of technology. I can\u2019t even imagine the way of thinking of the pioneers of the digital era who created the ways for us to casually take our phone from the pocket make a high definition video and send it right away to the other side of the world in seconds. We become too familiar with it too quickly. We didn\u2019t have this tech just 20-30 years ago!\r<br>\r<br>Now back to film. When it comes to creation process, I\u2019m a simple man. Whatever helps you to create better art is good for you. If you\u2019re getting in this mood of creation euphoria with film, then use film. If you\u2019re a writer and you get your creation mood sitting naked in the attic and typing your novel on 1941 Underwood type-writer, that\u2019s great!\r<br>But film itself doesn\u2019t make good photography. Grain doesn\u2019t make good photography. It\u2019s you. You make good photography. Your vision is the most important part of the process. So never forget to put your soul in what you\u2019re doing.

The vast majority of people when there was no digital cameras around were only using point and shoot cameras. Those don&#39;t give you the luxury of composing the shot you want the same way an SLR does. You don&#39;t have the lenses, there&#39;s no depth of field adjustment and as such the photos I took up until the day I got my own (digital) SLR were nothing to be particularly proud of. <br><br>Then there&#39;s the one thing which I find very important that digital does really well but which you can&#39;t get from analog and that&#39;s timestamps. There are cameras which will incorporate a timestamp on your shot and that can be helpful if you don&#39;t mind it on your photos but other than that, there&#39;s no way to know exactly when a photo has been taken unless you took a record in a notebook or something of the time and date and location. This may seem trifle, especially if the image is meant to be a work of art, but for memories it means that very often old photos will lack a temporal reference as you struggle to recall when a shot was taken and at what time.<br><br>I&#39;m pretty sure I still have a point and shoot from 2006 that is only half used and should probably be finished up so I can develop the roll one last time. Having done my own development once in black and white I can say with confidence that this is one thing that gave me the photography bug but while I see what you&#39;re saying about how much warmer and &quot;authentic&quot; film looks like, I still prefer digital. Not because it gives me the luxury of taking lots of throwaway images because I&#39;m quite frugal with my shots unless I try to shoot things in motion but because I always take the time to compose my shots, even with my smartphone and its lower quality sensor... but then again I do come from the film age of photography so when you learnt to shoot this way, it stays with you I suppose.", "comment_date": "2021-06-14T07:32:13Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Richard Washburn", "comment_text": "If you really want to experience photography have a negative printed on photographic paper, especially if it is medium or large format.", "comment_date": "2021-06-14T07:31:43Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Weee E", "comment_text": "That\u2019s the coolest door I\u2019ve ever seen", "comment_date": "2021-06-14T07:31:18Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Prasad Aher", "comment_text": "I&#39;ve been searching for this since like 1year \ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude2d thank youuuuu", "comment_date": "2021-06-14T07:31:00Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "\u0412\u0430\u0441\u0438\u043b\u044c \u0412", "comment_text": "<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCxoZlFqzwA&amp;t=21m01s\">21:01</a> great joke ))", "comment_date": "2021-06-14T07:29:52Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Dragon & Tiger", "comment_text": "<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCxoZlFqzwA&amp;t=18m44s\">18:44</a>", "comment_date": "2021-06-14T07:29:47Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "NaHCO3", "comment_text": "I totally respect artists who do their photography on analogue film.

It&#39;s just marketing. You are part of selling the idea that film is real while digital is fake cuz it&#39;s intangible. The reason why film looks good to many people is cuz professionals edit them and most people don&#39;t bother to learn how to edit.

I spent a lot of time doing B&amp;W darkroom work, and color as well, and those chemicals can be really nasty.  Also we didn&#39;t have to pop the ends off of the film canisters to get the film out, we had a little clip that we could use to fish the leader out and the canisters were recycled.  Our training was at Lowry AFB in Denver (now closed), and you couldn&#39;t ask for a better place to learn photography.  Right before I got out in 1994 I saw the beginnings of digital.  You would attach a special back to a film camera that had a sensor in it, and a cable connected it to a hard drive you clipped to your belt that was probably similar in size to a VHS tape, and it held anywhere from 50-150 images.", "comment_date": "2021-06-14T06:56:42Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Matt Dean", "comment_text": "I always enjoy your videos because I learn something everytime.

The nitrogen isn&#39;t pumped in because oxygen hurts the chemistry (oxygen does hurt the chemistry).  It&#39;s pumped in because it agitates the chemistry.  As the film develops, the chemicals near the film and directly in contact with it become used up and exhausted.  The nitrogen bubbles move the chemistry around in the tank and bring fresh chemistry in contact with the film.  The reason they use nitrogen for this instead of air is that air would oxidize the chemicals.  When you develop film by hand you follow a specific agitation schedule, you will either turn the whole tank upside down and back right again, or use a little rod to spin the film reels in the tank.  Film chemistry (especially color chemistry) is sensitive to temperature, time and agitation so it&#39;s extremely important to be consistent with those variables if you want consistent results.<br><br>Love the video!", "comment_date": "2021-06-14T06:06:08Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "L1ght Ch.", "comment_text": "I can feel the shock of the light and the temperature of the background, it is fake but you will have a memory in your brain tells you that the photo you take is same as the memory.

Always prints and then I went to positive slide film, still have my Kodak carousel projector. Loved shooting kodachrome and ektachrome. You could buy 200 asa and push it to 400 asa or 800 asa. Or, you could go the other way to very slow film, less than 100 asa, and get very fine grain along with great color (tripod required). <br><br>I always was a bit frustrated by the wait. First to finish a 36 exposure roll in the camera and then wait for the developer. Because of this and the expense, I learned to make every shot count; composition, light, everything. I kept a notebook of my shots, lighting, subject, settings, etc. My normal day job was as an electronic technician, then engineer. Back in those days everyone I knew had set up their own dark room and processed their own film. It teaches you everything you talked about in this video and I feel a bit surprised that this knowledge has been nearly lost by the general public. <br><br>I think the reason film photography is so good is because of the care and effort involved, and still today even with a digital camera, I try to make every shot count. Even so, digital photography still looks a bit flat footed to me and often the energy is not there.

So when we get film prints or scans back, they look magically &quot;natural&quot; and organic because they&#39;re closer to the color toning we relate to in the beauty we see in the world. With vinyl, the &quot;warmth&quot; people ascribe to the sound compared to digital is present because of harmonics, the same harmonics our ears pick up on and our brains subconsciously detect, and it <b>feels</b> good. Digital reproduces everything consistently, and over time we get used to that consistency, but when we compare it to analog images or sound, we can instantly tell that the analog versions retain the imperfections our brains are naturally inclined to focus on. This is why film/vinyl enthusiasts often refer to the digital counterparts of recorded audio/video as &quot;sterile&quot; or less interesting, because it doesn&#39;t recreate the imperfections that coincide with the biases our brains are naturally inclined to focus on.

The one you showed at the start of the video was a plastic mechanical one that would just ratchet it in automatically for you. But the stainless steel ones took a lot of abuse and lasted a long time. However, they sure did take practice to load right without any kinks and such. And then you had to do it in total blackness. It was the most finicky part of darkroom photography. On top of that, temperature is really important when developing. Where I was in school, the summers were HOT and the cold water pipes were not insulated. So sometimes the developers and rinses were simply not the right temperature (too warm), there was nothing you could do about it, and you had to adjust your chemical and rinse times on the fly. Sometimes you ended up with film that came out fine, sometimes it was off but created some wonderful pre-digital effects, and sometimes the whole role was made into garbage. I escaped ever having a roll destroyed, but I saw plenty of commiseration happening in the common areas of the darkroom when people lost their work on those rolls.", "comment_date": "2021-06-14T01:20:48Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Jackie", "comment_text": "This is so freaking cool!!

Mastery is a lot different with film. Color film whether negative or positive (slide) has less exposure latitude than your brain does when interpreting what your eye sees.

This channel is all about investigating those hidden details.  You showed how film gets processed, but never address the &quot;magic&quot; of film.  So here is my challenge to you:  Build a mirror rig with splitter lenses that will allow both a digital camera and a film camera to see the same scene from the same angle and take some pictures with both using a variety of lighting and targets.  Get the digitals of the film back and show a side by side comparison.  Next, take the image pairs to a specialist in training AI neural networks to create a custom image filter that can input a digital image, and output a digitized film image, and see if you can recreate the same looks and feel of film from a digital camera.  Both image sets are just pixels on the screen with the same LCD monitor color palette.  The only difference is the source pixels from the two cameras, and an AI neural net can probably do a pretty good job of converting the color space from one to the other.", "comment_date": "2021-06-14T00:28:08Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Craig Brauckmiller", "comment_text": "I guess what I\u2019m missing is that at the end of the day, you are still ending up with a digital file.

I ran one-hour photo labs for drugstores for a decade, ending right as the transition from film to digital was beyond the tipping point. We used Noritsu and Fuji machines roughly the size of a large kitchen island. Because we didn&#39;t have a darkroom, the machines were the darkrooms.<br><br>For the film, we&#39;d draw out the end, slice off the tongue, and tape it to a plastic card inserted into the machine. We applied twin check stickers, like Indie does, to ensure that negatives could be traced to the correct order envelope. When the card was inserted into the machine and the door was sealed, the machine drew the card and the attached film through the chemistry on a serpentine track. The machine would detect the end of the roll and cut the negatives free from their container, dropping the empties into a bin. At the other end of the machine, the negatives came out as a single strip.<br><br>We&#39;d take the processed negatives to the printer and thread them into a track. The negatives were drawn through frame by frame. We could adjust the color balance and lightness/darkness of each frame separately. Earlier machines projected light through the negatives directly onto the photosensitive paper inside the machine, which would then be drawn on another serpentine track through the chemistry, a rinse, and a dryer to be deposited on a conveyer belt at the top of the machine. Later machines digitally scanned the negatives and projected the scanned image onto the paper before sending it through the process. These machines also handled files from digital media, and by around 2006 or so were connected to the internet to receive customer orders online. Different sized photos required different widths of paper, so we often traded out light-sealed paper cartridges to print 4x6s, 5x7s, and 8x10s.<br><br>(EDIT: I submitted this before getting to the scanner section. That GUI is exactly what I used in the early- to mid-naughties on my Noritsu and Fuji machines!)<br><br>Finally, we&#39;d hand-cut the negatives and tuck them into the plastic accordion sleeves us middle-aged folks grew up seeing. Negatives and photos went into the envelope, and then the order would lie waiting for several days while the customer who was adamant that they needed the photos right away forgot that they&#39;d even dropped them off. :P", "comment_date": "2021-06-13T23:53:26Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Bradley D", "comment_text": "<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCxoZlFqzwA&amp;t=33m19s\">33:19</a> \ud83d\udcaf I think people feel like so much of our lives feel artificial and they want things to feel real and genuine.", "comment_date": "2021-06-13T23:53:02Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "World Traveler\u4e1c\u5317", "comment_text": "Man...

As a Millennial (I graduated high school in 2002), I was one of the last Millennials whom had used a disposable film camera on field trips and one of the first to get a digital camera. My high school graduation gift from my dad was a 1.3 megapixel digital point and shoot camera. After cutting my teeth with a Canon Rebel XS in 2011, I decided to try my luck again with film. Things went well. I would take the film canister, drop it off at Walmart, and the photo lab tech would send it off to Fuji Film for development. One day I only got half of the scanned prints back, with weird effects on the prints. No answer as to what happened, whether it was the camera, or the film. So I started to develop my own color film at home with a light tight canister. I came to the conclusion that it was the film, as I had no negatives come back from Fuji Film (they just trashed the negatives) and could not reproduce the weird effects with the camera.<br><br>I decided to develop my dad&#39;s old rolls of film. I knew that I could see something on the negatives, but when I scanned the negatives in, everything looked white. I figured Fuji Film would of just thrown the rolls away and be like, &quot;Sorry!&quot; Well, I decided to use Photoshop CS3, my new &quot;digital darkroom&quot; to try and salvage the images. I managed to salvage over 243 images. What came to light really surprised me, and I was able to date the film. My sister was only one pound some ounces when she was born premature. They had to put her in baby doll clothes she was so little. So I have seen the photos of my sister in the NICU, and photos of her at home a year or more later. These photos contained the transition from when my sister first came home from the hospital after being born. It wasn&#39;t the best in the world, being 30 years old and not being developed in many years. However, it was still enough to be recognizable. I gave the prints that I made from the negatives to my sister for her 30th birthday in 2016. She then ruined it by asking, &quot;How come nobody&#39;s ever seen these photos before?!&quot;", "comment_date": "2021-06-13T23:38:43Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Brian Clark", "comment_text": "I&#39;d be very interested in a follow-up detailing how prints were made before the digital revolution.

I chose to buy a Nikon over a Canon or other brand because I wanted to use my grandfather&#39;s old lenses in the new camera. I think the old lenses are &lt;i&gt;part&lt;/i&gt; of the reason film photos have that nostalgic feel. When I clip in my non-smart, antique lenses into my DSLR, I DO get the same feelings out of the pictures. I agree that the chemistry of film and developing process adds a lot to the &quot;feel&quot; of film photos, but the smart lenses of today&#39;s cameras are, IMHO, too smart.

Aren&#39;t the bleaches, the used water, the silver particles that get washed out toxic pollutants? Are they just thrown down the drain or is there some kind of treatment to minimize their impact in nature, especially rivers and aquatic life? On the other hand, we are too liberal with digital images and we know that processing and storage are going through the roof. How impactful is that too, this insane amount of energy and resources that goes into basically making digital clutter?

I worked at a photo lab for a couple of years, and we had these massive Fuji machines that did everything for you. We didn&#39;t even need a dark room - we had dark BOXES, for doing certain tasks (loading rolls of photo paper into these massive canisters that mated into the printing machine, and also for extracting non-35 mm film), but that was it. Also, we had a neat little device for extracting the leader of the film from the canister...it was like, a roll of thick tape, sticky on one side, non-sticky on the other, mounted into a desktop device that allowed you to easily advance and retrieve the tape. You&#39;d stick the end of the tape into the slit that the film comes out of, and fish around in there, and the tape would stick to the leader and you could extract it. Then, you would cut the leader, use the double-sticker system to label the film and the envelop from whence it came (so that it was always paired with the right person&#39;s information), tape (on both sides) the film to this plastic leader sheet, which got fed into the machine, and it would pull the film out of the canister as it advanced, meaning that it was never exposed to the light. Each leader sheet could do two rolls of film. After about 8 minutes, the film would be developed.<br><br>I also have some experience with the B+W home darkroom method, which is done completely in the dark (for the film development process). I was in photo club at school as a teen, so I learned the entire black and white technique, and still have a lot of photos from that period of my life. Also...darkrooms are great places for making out. Just sayin&#39;.
