The idea is not to release all of the energy in the powder at one time, because that would lead to very high pressures, quite possibly turning the breech or the barrel of the gun into shrapnel before the bullet/shot has time to accelerate and for the hot gases to expand a bit. (That&#39;s also exactly why detonation, especially with higher speed high explosives, is so &quot;brisant&quot;, i.e. apt to cause fracturing in materials, and why lower speed high explosives like ANFO are better for mining work: often you don&#39;t want to just fracture everything into gravel, but to be pushed more gently into coarser rubble, without affecting the stability of the remaining rockbed.)<br><br>Instead we&#39;d ideally like to have a burn which rapidly pushes the pressure inside the barrel to the engineering limit, then keeps it steady at that level right till when the bullet exits the barrel, and then suddenly stops developing any extra energy. That way we get the most velocity out of a given amount of propellant and barrel length, or vice versa minimize maximum recoil force, if lesser muzzle velocities suffice.<br><br>This flattening of the pressure profile is then actually what ammunition manufacturers try to achieve, via precisely controlling the grain geometry of the powder, via the composition of the primary propellant, and via the addition of various chemicals, some of which actually act as flame retardants in various phases of the burn. Also, this is why high end ammunition, especially for long range sniper fire, requires a careful match between the loading, the composition of the propellant, the bullet, and the gun itself: obviously the deflagration profile is going to affect recoil forces, any heat transfer to the barrel is going to minutely affect the details of the burn, caliper is going to affect the mechanical advantage between the inertia of the bullet and the expanding gases behind it, leading to varying exit velocity, there&#39;s wear to the barrel to consider, and who knows what else which could couple to the ballistics.<br><br>Since we&#39;re trying to get smarter every day, here, maybe Destin could return to the topic one day? I mean it&#39;s much more complicated than you&#39;d think, and <b>totally</b> fascinating.

I have been an explosive Engineer for the last fourty years and I am certain that the propellent in any small arms cartridge does not deflagrate, it burns. The speed of the burn is controlled by the mix of the propellant the quality of the percussion cap and the degree of confinement. If you burn Small Arms Ammunition unconfined you will have the same rate of combustion until the case splits, after that the remaining propellent will burn much more slowly. Burning cartridges will typically send the projectile no more than a few meters. I burnt 1.2 million small arms cartridges  from .22inch to .50 calibre in a steel skip. None of the projectiles  went more than ten metres I investigated several bore deflagrations where the projectile containing a High Explosives has functioned in the bore of an Artillery Piece.  Generally HE Projectiles are a mix of RDX and TNT (Comp B).  When they function prematurely in the bore it is generally due to cracks in the fill or a micro deflagration caused by loose explosive dust in the fuze well. On set Back (the first dynamic force acting on the projectile) the fuze can apply sufficient force on the dust to detonate it. However, the detonation cannot be sustained sufficiently to propagate a full detonation and the projectile deflagrates in the bore. There are many examples of this effect on the internet. As an aside, when the projectile is manufactured the grain of the steel runs along the long axis. This was not a problem in early days as the propellant burnt less violently with a subsequently lower pressure. Modern propellants are faster burning and higher pressure. In early trials this led to the propellant progressing into the projectile cavity causing a deflagration. The solution was to weld a flat disk of steel with its steel grain at 90deg to the long axis. This is known as a &quot;Slatter Base Plate&quot;. So burning, faster burning= Explosion. Deflagration ( where a detonating compound does not reach a full detonation) Detonating= a full detonation where the High Explosive reaches is full velocity of detonation (V of D).
