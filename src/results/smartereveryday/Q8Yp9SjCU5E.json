The string is released using a release which is mechanical and releases the string perfect every time. The cams of a compound bow at the ends of the limbs use technology  that allows the archer to have what&#39;s called let off meaning if a bow is 60 lbs in pull weight and the bow as a let off of 80 percent then the archer will only feel 20 percent of the original pull weight when the string is fully pulled ( depending on what&#39;s called draw length which differs between shooters).<br>What this archer is doing is beyond difficult a 70lb pull weight with no let off no sights being that accurate is ridiculous and an amazing skill.

It lasts so long that i dont even remember when i bought last pack of blades, and i only buy 2 blades at a time. I just apply some hand wash to face and shave takes 2 mins. No after shave. I think 2 blades last well over a year for me. I shave 3 times in 2 weeks. I cant possibility go cheaper than that.

The object being thrown is gradually slowed due to gravity until it reaches it&#39;s peak height and a velocity of 0. At this point it turns around and begins it&#39;s acceleration in the other direction. Because of this, the objects spends the most time near the peak of its trajectory. I noticed during Bryon&#39;s shots, that he seemed to be hitting the objects thrown during their initial descent. This got me to thinking of what might be easier - shooting the arrow as it rises toward the peak (mentally calculating where the peak will be), or shooting the arrow as the object reaches its peak (mentally calculating where it will be soon after the peak)? Or are they the same? It would be interesting to work backward from the observed velocity of the arrow and the time of contact with the object to find just when Bryon fired his arrow as a function of the the objects position in it&#39;s trajectory.<br><br>Thanks for yet another great video and thank you for all you do!", "comment_date": "2015-03-26T15:36:06Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Porco", "comment_text": "hacks confirmed", "comment_date": "2015-03-26T06:57:32Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "nw prospecting and outdoors", "comment_text": "not to mention Andersen shoots a kid bow at around 10 yards . now Byron may do that for show but is a great shot at any distance. \u00a0with a real bow made \u00a0for a grown man", "comment_date": "2015-03-26T05:05:42Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Michael Digiovangiacomo", "comment_text": "I love the videos.

One thing should be noted however. It wouldn&#39;t be easier to make those shots with a modern bow. It would in fact be more difficult. If we&#39;re talking about a hitting a stationary target then yes, absolutely it would be easier with a modern bow &amp; sights, but when shooting at aerial targets the traditional long bow is the superior system. Think about it as a rifle verses a shotgun. I&#39;m not talking about one bullet verses a bunch of pellets but rather the sighting systems &amp; techniques of shooting the two different weapons. On a rifle you have a good set of sights much like a modern compound bow, but using those sights to hit a flying target, even if they&#39;re on something like a turkey shotgun shooting the same ammo as any other shotgun, is extremely difficult. On a normal shotgun like a bird gun there are no sights, just a small bead on the front of the gun, and you shoot it by looking at the target. It&#39;s the same with a long bow &amp; a compound bow. Having sights would only make hitting those flying target more difficult.<br><br>All of that being said, I want to be absolutely clear about one thing. I am not in any way saying what Byron was doing is easy! I shoot both modern compound bows and traditional recurve bows, and I couldn&#39;t even begin to hit a flying target like that!", "comment_date": "2015-03-02T21:17:20Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "N37BU6", "comment_text": "Does Harry&#39;s name their razors after heads of state?", "comment_date": "2015-03-02T21:12:20Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "JustJP100", "comment_text": "This is a really cool channel.", "comment_date": "2015-03-02T20:56:55Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Damian Baldriche", "comment_text": "Saw this guy on Netflix stan lees super humans fkin awesome", "comment_date": "2015-03-02T20:52:22Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Kyle Weinschenker", "comment_text": "No funner everyday extra with Brady!?
