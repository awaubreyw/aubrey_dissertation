This is the typical cause of wooden bats breaking. For this reason, ballplayers hold  their bats in such a way that when they swing, the bat strikes the ball along the grain, and not against it. The direction of the grain on a bat is indicated by the placement of the label: if one holds the label towards oneself while gripping the bat, the ball will strike the bat along the grain, substantially reducing the likelihood that the bat will break.<br><br>I have no training in physics, so I don&#39;t know how to explain this in a technically proficient way. But the idea is something like this. Take a (not too thick) paperback book, and hold the front cover toward you, pressing your finger in the center of the cover. What you are doing here is applying force to the book against the &#39;grain&#39; of the pages. Note how much force it takes to make the book bend. Now hold it on its side, with its spine facing you, and apply pressure to the spine of the book - along the &#39;grain&#39; of the pages. You will note that it takes far more force to make the book bend in this way. Now imagine that the pages are held together rigidly, as in the structure of wood, and you will start to see why a bat held so that it strikes the ball against the grain will break far more easily than a bat held so that it strikes the ball along the grain.<br><br>I don&#39;t know whether a properly-aligned wooden bat could withstand the stresses of this machine, but this bat was certainly not properly aligned.", "comment_date": "2020-01-26T05:25:15Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Objectivityiskey", "comment_text": "You should have used the cold steel polypropylene bats.", "comment_date": "2020-01-26T05:20:24Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Brad Moyer", "comment_text": "Love your channel and understand your interest in aviation, please address a question I\u2019ve had for a while, I sort of understand the principles behind a wing generating lift, what I don\u2019t understand is why they don\u2019t simply fall out of the sky when they are in a tight radius turn with their wings perpendicular to the ground?

You also remind me of my Jr. High School Teacher that taught REACH.  It was a class that 8 or so kids that instead of going to our regular classes every day, we would go half in the morning one day and then half in the morning on another day and as we got older, it changed as to the frequency or length.  By 7, 8, and 9th grade we had it substituting one of our classes for it.  Loved that class. Example of what we did: In 3rd grade we all read the Canterbury Tales, just who we wanted to be and tell our story to everyone, but I remembered these words: \u201c You will memorize the prologue to the Canterbury Tales in Middle English and I promise you, when you become a senior in High-School you will be thankful that you memorized it now.\u201d!  We performed for Colleges, High-Schools and for the local TV.  Anyway, I guess a too happy southern Church goer is better than a 60 year old mechanical engineer who hates kids and got more money than he could ever made in his life and all he had to do is keep it under control for 15 minutes at a time, lol.

Not ideal, but a good last-minute addition.<br>- Pinning the apparatus to the ground is advised, as well as weighting the base to make it less susceptible to vibration.<br>- For high-risk devices, consider adding &quot;dead-man&quot; safeties.  e.g. on the main controller, and/or even a dedicated switch/person.  <br>- Did your insurer sign off on that shoot?  Woof!  :)<br><br><br>General...<br>- It seems like this project did not get quite as much planning as others.  Given the general success so far, a &quot;redo&quot; or &quot;revisit&quot; may be worthwhile.  <br>- Additional high-speed camera angles (add one perpendicular to the flight path, and an overhead angle) to allow for better data collection<br>- Additional analysis of the data (impact kinetics (ball, primary bat, secondary bat), flight path, machine vibration/harmonics, etc.)<br>- Could you apply motor-braking (as done with your circular saw project) as a safety feature to the batting machine?  In certain failure modes might this be <b>more</b> dangerous than without?<br>- Yes, I realize that staffing, personal time/schedule limitations, and cost are factors that may rule out &quot;bigger and better.&quot;  Use the ideas as you see fit.<br><br><br>Thanks for the open discussion of science and engineering.  <br>- - Aaron S.", "comment_date": "2020-01-04T14:59:53Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "cellominork", "comment_text": "Who else thinks the bats are like a propeller when they get going", "comment_date": "2020-01-04T14:55:43Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Zach Young", "comment_text": "You all should be wearing helmets", "comment_date": "2020-01-04T14:53:20Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Successfull Youtuber", "comment_text": "I was watching another science show where they busting myths about lighters igniting.

Then it all canceled out. Can&#39;t break a record with an illegal bat. By the way, I don&#39;t think anyone ever hit a ball much over 550 ft. <br>That said, the new studies in launch angle and exit velocity has changed the game. Extreme impact is what we saw/are seeing now. A perfect example was Daniel Murphy, who was a good line drive hitter. But Murphy always fell just short. What he always had though, was that special intangible that&#39;s rare in baseball. The Mets could be down 10 runs with 2 outs and 2 strikes in the 9th. If Dan was at the plate, he&#39;d believe they could still win. He was a rally starter and someone who never gave up. Well, it seems the Mets hired a guy who worked with Dan and Murphy took to this new batting tech like a duck to water. He showed how he was transformed in the 2015 post season. I knew he (in baseball terms) &quot;got it&quot;. Some players get whatever their &quot;it&quot; is young, some older and some never. Unfortunately for Murphy, he got his it in the last quarter of his career. The Mets, in their infinite wisdom didnt want to pay Murphy, thinking his change was an aberration. But, nothing could be more wrong and he was sighed by the Nats for what would turn out to be a major bargain for them and went on to play MVP baseball, making his teammate Bryce Harper look silly by comparison. Bottom line: This was all due to Murphy and the new batting theories meshing like Mike Scott and the split finger that saved his career. Many probably thought that Muphy started taking PEDs, but all the evidence was clear, as to what happened. Sadly, had Dan discovered this at 25, he would likely be a first ballot HOFer. That&#39;s how amazing it was. Go look him up from 2015 thru 2018. He was an unstoppable force.<br>Anyway, love the batting machine, just disappointed that you guys used an illegal bat. You may as well have shot the baseball out of a cannon. I suppose it&#39;s the fun of the whole thing.

That is the famous homerun that came within a foot or two of being the only ball ever hit out of the older Yankee Stadium. When it hit the facade, the ball was 118 feet high and 370 feet from Mickey&#39;s bat to the point where it hit the facade. Although the physics of ball flight is not simple, calculations predicted the ball would have traveled 734 feet if it has not been stopped. I watched many games at the old Yankee Stadium. I often sat in the seats below where Mickey&#39;s ball hit. Looking up at that facade, it was always inconceivable to me that a human could hit a ball that high and that far.

Are you trying to hit the furthest baseball ever under the most perfect circumstances or under legal MLB requirements? I think it would be fun to do it under perfect circumstances. MLB uses wooden bats which have a significantly lower restitution, mainly to protect the pitcher and other infielders. <br>So since you mentioned restitution, let\u2019s start with baseball bat regulations. The three most common for highschool, college and some adult leagues are USSSA, BESR, and the most common now BBCOR. USSSA uses a ratio in what they call \u201cBat Performance Factor\u201d (BPF) of 1.20. Meaning that after the ball makes direct contact with the bat, the exit velocity will be at most 20% more than entry velocity. BESR is an older standard and more sought after for adult leagues with no regulations and you can find some of these bats on eBay for almost $1000 brand new. BESR stands for \u201cBat Exit Speed Ratio\u201d and measure the combined three: ball entry velocity, ball exit velocity and bat swing speed. It was only after about 8 years bat manufacturing companies were finding ways to insert high quality alloys and composite into many different parts of the baseball bat trying to give it as much \u201cPOP\u201d as possible. They quickly found that two-piece bats had some mysterious trampoline effect that one piece bats didn\u2019t and boy did it give the batter more power. And this transitions us into the current baseball bat standard for most non-professional leagues, BBCOR. This stands for Bat-Ball-Coefficient-of-Restitution. On most bars along with this you\u2019ll see the number 0.50. Restitution in physics is generally expressed between 0 (non-elastic) and 1 (perfectly elastic). Most wooden bats have a BBCOR rating around 0.50 and this was established again to level the playing field and protect the players of the game. <br>My conclusion after explaining all of this, is you want to find a baseball bat that is BESR rated but doesn\u2019t flex like most two-piece bats that you\u2019ll find. I recommend triple alloy bats or full composite bats. <br>Now that we are done with that, let\u2019s talk about swinging the bat. Your angle was fine for swinging the bat around, at speeds that high. But one major thing that wasn\u2019t taken into consideration was that baseball players to don\u2019t swing the bat straight around. If you look up many videos of baseball players explaining the perfect swing, you\u2019ll notice as they swing they rotate their wrists counter clockwise through their swing thus rotating the barrel of the bat. Doing so allows that batter to make more solid straight-on contact on the ball, while establishing backspin on the exit of the ball from the bat giving it a higher exit velocity and also allowing it to fly higher. If you were able to figure out a way to employ this into your mechanical engineering, this would be game changing for sure. If you have any other questions feel free to message me. I\u2019ve done a great deal of baseball science research throughout my life and love that I\u2019m able to share it with you. Hope you get to see this.

That is because the force from the machine is sending this energy outward from the machines center point of rotation and the bat is in a fixed position aimed &#39;near&#39; the center point of rotation; Amongst other variables like rotational speed and the resistance of the side winds changing to the upcoming and on coming winds as time moves forward.<br><br> If you were to move the mound, or machine closer to 1st base, slowing the pitch slightly and aiming to the left of the centerline of the machines designated center origin of rotation, your machine could make contact between the ball and bat, creating a statistic that is greater than the one just stimulated in this video.

If someone coughs on the outside surface of the container of liquid it can be enough to pop the bubble. Also. Temperature is a non considered variable so far. Both the proper operating temperature of the entire device and the active temperature fluctuations from within the bubble. Apparently the gas inside becomes plasma when squeezed properly on all sides. Plasma In a bubble trapped in resonant frequency matched liquid is Supposedly in excess of 10,000\u2070F. The bubble will bounce from this tight plasma state back to &quot;full expansion&quot; and shift from that extreme high temp state to under -250\u2070 extreme low state and oscillate between the two until disturbed.

As for the composite bats i hear that the more they break in the farther you can hit the ball also i would think they are less likely to dent. also what would be best if you can make the bat spring loaded with a gearing to reset the bat kinda like a skeet trap but allow the bat to keep rotating or adding some kinda breaking mechanism to slow it down.

Sias", "comment_text": "Great video! Got a subscriber. Just some random musings...that Skunk Works book is a good one. I grew up in Palmdale, CA very close to the giant Lockheed building. My grandfather and uncle served, then went into aerospace engineering and both worked on black projects quite a bit. Too late for the SR-71 (which I used to see/hear from my house in the 70s as they would train out of Edwards AFB). They worked on the radar absorbent skin of the B1-B, B2, F-117, as well as the heat dissipating tiles of the Space Shuttles. My uncle also worked on the F-22 before retiring. It\u2019s amazing how much earlier many of these aircraft systems were conceived and mocked up, then built and tested, before the public ever knew a thing. We heard multiple sonic booms most days and I just assumed that everyone did growing up. Lol. About the baseball machine, maybe if you used titanium bats... But seriously even with an aluminum bat going 250 mph, it\u2019s crazy that air friction knocked that ball down short of 700 feet. I\u2019m trying to remember if drag increases at a more than linear rate as an object accelerates. I think you get diminishing returns but I\u2019ll have to look it up. But think about MLB players with <b>wooden</b> bats swinging \u201conly\u201d in the high 90s, being able to crank a ball 550+ feet, or about 80% of what your Batcopter did. Of course, you guys probably never really got hold of one on the sweet spot with the perfect timing and angle. Probably could have cleared 800 feet! Lastly I\u2019m suspicious about those old timey HR records. I have no doubt that the Babe and Mantle absolutely mashed baseballs. But look at some shots by Big Mac and Bonds, among others (yes, juiced as they were). Two HRs that pop into my head are the upper deck shot Bonds hit at Yankee stadium and the ball he hit against the Angels where you can see Tim Salmon saying \u201cthat\u2019s the furthest ball I\u2019ve ever seen hit\u201d. Not to mention some of the shots into McCovey cove or that time he annihilated Gagne\u2019s 100 mph high heater. I think that ball might still be in the air! Point is I don\u2019t think MLB wants to count HR distances from the 90s/00s because my eyes and ears tellme quite a few guys exceeded the official records. I played too and as you say the sound of a hit tells you a lot...plus when a ball is just past its apex when it it flies over a 400\u2019 sign...yeah. Anyhoo, again a great video. Appreciate the time you guys put into it and now I\u2019m off to binge some of your other vids!
