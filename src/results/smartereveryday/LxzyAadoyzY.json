Bird wings can be far more aerodynamic, and can have chord thickness. Bats will not likely evolve this. Bats are incredibly vulnerable and fragile, many birds are not. An injury to a bat&#39;s wing likely means permanent incapacitation; birds just lose a few feathers and quickly grow them back. Feathers are way lighter and can provide buoyancy and superior warmth.  The range of bird flight (fast, slow, huge, tiny, efficient like the albatross), is far greater than that of bats, and birds are far more common on the planet, and occupy every climate.  Bats are much more rare.  The one thing I think is clever is this business of hanging upside down.  This saves energy, but is a problem as far as pooping and peeing.        Birds win.   Although I&#39;d love to have a giant flying fox as a trained pet.", "comment_date": "2021-10-14T01:15:26Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Smit Patil", "comment_text": "Bats are my new favorite animal after whales", "comment_date": "2021-10-11T09:20:29Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "StarWolf 621", "comment_text": "StarWolf watched this.", "comment_date": "2021-08-26T23:48:11Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Darth Vader", "comment_text": "Hey what&#39;s that music at the end?!", "comment_date": "2021-07-26T15:33:31Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Jet Petty", "comment_text": "Excellent video on bat flight!", "comment_date": "2021-07-24T19:28:43Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Chad Carew", "comment_text": "I&#39;ve never thought about a swimming bat before.
