What is interesting to the naked eye is what happens when they come out of feather and increase RPM.  When viewed 90 degrees perpendicular to the engine and directly in line with the plane of rotation of the blades, a noticeable \u201cwobble\u201d takes place as the blades begin to spin at speeds where the propeller takes the shape of a disk. This all occurs as the prop settles into idle speeds.  Imagine it similar to the wobble you see in a child\u2019s toy top spinning. I\u2019d really like to know what is happening during this phase of operation.  Is it the change in blade pitch I\u2019m seeing?  Are the blades actually bending as they change speed and angle of attack?  A slow motion video would be amazing!!  Just an idea.
