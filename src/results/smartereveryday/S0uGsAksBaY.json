It lessens the impact that the pinna has on the recorded audio. The pinna shape is crucial in your localisation of sound especially vertically as the time and frequency difference between the two ears is the same if the sound is directly above, in front, below or behind you. If you use a dummy head for example the neumann binaural setup, the mics are placed back inside the ear canal and therefore the pressure differences and pinna affect the sound too making for a far more realistic experience.
