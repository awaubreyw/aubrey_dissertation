In the case of hundreds or thousands of lightning bugs in the woods. It would be extremely difficult to track any one bug lighting up and if there are multiples very near each other then you may see a blink in the same spot and think its the same one. The result is that you have bugs blinking at slightly different rates but you will inevitably see some of them synced up and there may be other groups that are synced up but off cycle from another group. So you end up seeing what looks like the entire forest synced up. Although, you would probably also see times when none of them are synced up as well but if you keep watching then they will eventually get groups synced back up, then out of sync, then back in sync. (sin wave?) Also, depending on how you used the blinking led.

So I believe those are the reasons I had success with a prime lens and not a zoom despite my using the same aperture setting on both lenses.

I had noticed that some would blink differently than others, but just thought the same firefly would behave differently at times.<br><br>This evening, I tracked ones that would flash for maybe a quarter second every 5-7 seconds. They were rising out of the grass and flowers at the edges of the yard. These were the ones I remember from my childhood. It looks like they are called the common eastern firefly or big dipper firefly. But there were others that came out about 15 minutes later. They were about half the size and would just give a quick blink every 3-4 seconds. They came out from a wooded area, and were much harder to see and catch. It&#39;s going to take a little more research to find out what they are called.

I thought for that second I saw a huge group of fireflies/lightning bugs flash in unison amongst the vast fields in the dark fields on either side of the road. After the car passed, I tested that wonder by briefly switching my headlights off and back on and the entirety of the surrounding fields responded in unison, thousands of fireflies like some alien biological signaling attempt.

To me this would have to be somewhat impossible as everyone driving would have to intentionally switch on their turn signals at the same time. Maybe it has something to do with the timing sequence in each car that at some point they all synchronize or an optical illusion is created.

This is the best news you\u2019ll ever hear. All of us, without exception, have sinned and fall short of the glory of God (Romans 3:23). And because God is just and will not let sin go unpunished, the wages of sin is death (Romans 6:23). As a result, that means that as sinners, we will all get what we rightly deserve: eternal punishment, which is called the second death. But the good news is that God is loving and does not wish that any should perish but that all would come to repentance (2 Peter 3:9). So He made a way for us to be saved and now graciously offers you the free gift of eternal life through Jesus Christ (Romans 6:23), all while justice is done. He sent His Son, Jesus Christ, to die on behalf of us and pay for our sins on a cross, and He was then buried and rose again on the third day (1 Corinthians 15:1-4). Regardless of who you are or what you may have done, if you believe with your heart the gospel ( ^^ which I just mentioned above) and confess with your mouth that Jesus is Lord, you shall be saved (Romans 10:9,10). Salvation is simple and free. It\u2019s not a 12 step program, and don\u2019t think, as many do, that you just have to be a \u201cgood person\u201d or do good works to go to heaven. Salvation is based on what Jesus did, not what you do (Ephesians 2:8,9). Believe in Christ, and you will be saved. \u201cFor God so loved the world that He gave His only begotten Son that whosoever should believe in Him shall not perish but have eternal life. For God did not send His Son into the world to condemn the world but to save the world through Him.\u201d John 3:16,17", "comment_date": "2022-06-21T06:21:49Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Shrutit Patel", "comment_text": "University in the USA give Justin honorary PHD please.", "comment_date": "2022-06-21T06:20:49Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Alejandro Villegas", "comment_text": "all the blessings for you and your family Destin. i`m following you since more than a decade and is always a pleasure learn and learn more and feel smarter everyday.", "comment_date": "2022-06-21T06:20:31Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "fun fun fun", "comment_text": "I love this!

When I watch my cats attempt to catch a laser pointer it is extremely disorienting to turn it on and off rapidly all over the room. flashing everywhere all at once moving extraordinarily rapidly. This might be a defense mechanism designed to confuse any creatures attempting to catch them like birds or other type of insects that may want to get a nice glowing snack. I know it might seem counterintuitive because they&#39;re lighting up there for showing themselves in the dark however by synchronizing with the rest it becomes impossible to pay attention to that one individual. however what many people may not realize is many insects and animals have excellent night vision. sometimes even better than what they can see in the day specifically for hunting. These bright flashes might be so disorienting and confusing to any potential prey that it becomes nearly impossible to pick out any individual especially when combined with synchronization. So even though they might see all of the fireflies everywhere they can &quot;never&quot; actually get one. it also is  probably doubling communication letting any other fireflies nearby what is going on based on the frequency in a local area. When there are no threats the whole Forest might synchronize. whereas when a threat arrives a local area begins to change flash out of distress just like when that fireflies seem to be playing dead when in your hand by not flashing. Combining that with synchronization could cause a whole part of the forest to stop flashing and then all of a sudden a small area is void of flashing causing whatever Predator that is in the area to lose track of any of them and possibly give up.", "comment_date": "2022-06-20T20:37:14Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Lolpiea", "comment_text": "What&#39;s the song called :)", "comment_date": "2022-06-20T20:37:09Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Karl-Petter \u00c5kesson", "comment_text": "Lovely episode!

I was then treated to one of the most overwhelming phenomena of my life (certainly up until that point).  The display I saw really shook my understanding of the world (I was a cocky 19 year old who thought he understood everything) and sparked curiosity that is still going strong 20 years later.  Back in 2002 I was told by the ranger that the phenomena was only recorded 2 places on the planet, one being in the Smokies and the other in a mountain range in Afghanistan.  I cannot tell you how happy this video made when Destin shared that this is becoming more common behavior for firefly.  I have shared this story many times in the past 20 years and am thrilled that more and more people will have the opportunity to experience this.   I love all of Destin&#39;s videos but this one hit me in the warm and fuzzies.", "comment_date": "2022-06-20T16:36:33Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Adam Garrity", "comment_text": "Bro!

It is a feedback loop it is pretty simple, if you are clapping faster than the average or in this case blinking faster, you slow down a little. If you are blinking slower you blink a little faster next time. Eventually everyone will blink together. The reason for why these bugs do it is pretty easy to figure out. They do this as a defense mechanism against predators like other insects this is not a perfect example but it is sort of like Zebras if they all stick together it is harder for the hunter to track one fire fly because they all blink together you can&#39;t track one bugs trajectory.

An &quot;F-stop&quot; is a multi parameter variable, but basically a lower F-stop means a more open aperture. You can also manually set the camera&#39;s ISO to a higher than normal value which adjusts the imaging sensor to be electronically more sensitive to light. It also helps if you can set the camera to a frame rate of 30 or less FPS. This will decrease shutter speed allowing the sensor to gather more light. This makes an extremely short range of focus (not distance from the camera, but the actual width, radially out from the lens, of usable focus) which is why you need to set these manually or else the camera will constantly be trying to focus. Even with careful settings, this also produces a sort of &quot;tunnel vision&quot; effect where the edges of the image will be blurry. The larger the lens diameter the less this edge blur happens. Also slower shutter speed will cause moving objects to create blurred streaks (or (NOT) inter-dimensional, multi-winged flying beings) .", "comment_date": "2022-06-20T16:32:36Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Nasm Boyd", "comment_text": "Love the beard \u2764\ufe0f", "comment_date": "2022-06-20T16:32:03Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Michael Foulk", "comment_text": "Did you notice the fire flys in the photos almost look moving in streams in the Forrest.

However one time when I was a teenager around the 4th of July, I set off a 60g mortar firework, not even thinking about the fireflies. The firework exploded high up in the air as designed, and after about a 2-3sec delay the entire backyard lit up with fireflies at the exact same moment. I mean thousands of fireflies and at EXACTLY the same moment. It seemed like every single one was triggered to flash by that firework explosion.  I&#39;ve lit many fireworks since in the same spot, but never have I seen the same phenomenon repeated. Maybe the explosion was just the right height/color/timing, or maybe it was an invention of my mind.

These greenish glowing spots were being produced by small (@ \u00bd the size of a firefly) creatures crawling slowly about. <br>I believe that they were firefly larvae getting ready to change into adult form before the upcoming summer season. <br><br>Can anyone help verify or dispute this please?", "comment_date": "2022-06-20T15:02:14Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Craig Burnett", "comment_text": "We experienced this at our cabin out in the middle of nowhere in northwest Missouri just two nights ago.
