First, you explain the fact that the baby\u2019s heart bypasses the lungs when in the womb, but you don\u2019t explain that it is bypassing because the baby\u2019s system is pumping the baby\u2019s blood through the umbilical cord to the placenta so that it can get oxygenated there.  And the realization that the only way the baby\u2019s blood could possibly get oxygenated at the placenta is because the baby\u2019s blood must have a higher affinity for binding oxygen than the mother\u2019s blood or else it wouldn\u2019t be able to gather oxygen for the baby to use in the womb. And consider that once the baby\u2019s blood has higher binding affinity for oxygen, what that could mean once it hits 20% oxygen in the atmosphere at the lung interface at birth.   Which leads to the incredible fact that the baby converts it\u2019s entire blood from higher oxygen affinity prenatal blood to regular blood that works with lungs and atmosphere incredibly fast right after that first breath. Yeah.
