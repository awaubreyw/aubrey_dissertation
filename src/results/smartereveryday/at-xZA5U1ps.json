He was killed on the cross as payment for the sins of all mankind, three days later He rose from the dead. Forty days later He ascended into heaven where He sits at the right hand of the Father. He is returning very soon, but before He does, Satan, the devil, is coming to pretend to be Jesus/God. Satan is an angel, and he will have certain supernatural powers with which to try to fool everyone. He will, for example, be able to make fire come down from heaven in the sight of men. He will only be on earth a short time before the real King of Kings, Jesus Christ, God in the flesh, returns. When the real Jesus comes we will all be transformed into our spiritual bodies at the same moment. Jesus came in the flesh to offer forgiveness of sins and eternal life to anyone who believes and calls on His precious name!<br><br>if thou shalt confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus, and shalt believe in thine heart that God hath raised him from the dead, thou shalt be saved. - Romans 10:9<br><br>Now when Jesus was in Bethany, in the house of Simon the leper, There came unto him a woman having an alabaster box of very precious ointment, and poured it on his head, as he sat at meat. But when his disciples saw it, they had indignation, saying, To what purpose is this waste? For this ointment might have been sold for much, and given to the poor. When Jesus understood it, he said unto them, Why trouble ye the woman? for she hath wrought a good work upon me. For ye have the poor always with you; but me ye have not always. For in that she hath poured this ointment on my body, she did it for my burial. Verily I say unto you, Wheresoever this gospel shall be preached in the whole world, there shall also this, that this woman hath done, be told for a memorial of her. - Matthew 26:6-13<br><br>Seek ye the LORD while he may be found, call ye upon him while he is near: Let the wicked forsake his way, and the unrighteous man his thoughts: and let him return unto the LORD, and he will have mercy upon him; and to our God, for he will abundantly pardon.<br><br>To anoint your self, the sick, or a building for spiritual protection:<br>Get a small bottle of olive oil and pour off a small amount into a smaller vessel like a vial or baby food jar. Use the rest of the bottle for cooking. Ask the Lord to bless your vial of oil in Jesus name. Anoint yourself with the oil by placing a dab of oil on tip of finger and touch it to your forehead, and ask the Lord to bless you/heal you. Place a dab of oil on your finger and anoint the door posts and order all negativity and evil out of the house, and order that nothing negative or evil can enter into your home including piggybacking on a person entering, order it  to be so in the name of Jesus. Anoint all potential entrances to your home. To anoint the sick, place oil on tip of finger and touch it to the head of the sick and say a prayer of healing over them in Jesus name.

This wave also explains the sprinkles breaking into small pieces as well, as the air pressure inside the bottle from just the impact being conveyed by the plastic is causing everything to break, and in the microseconds following we see that ultimate reaction. It is also interesting to note that the sprinkles in the bottom-right corner of the bottle do not break apart, suggesting that the other material absorbs and breaks that wave rather quickly, and the bottle stretching also helps diffuse that energy. To return back to the point, this would form at any high-speed impact and I&#39;d recommend setting up a microphone to capture any inaudible sound waves that are below the hearing range to confirm this.", "comment_date": "2022-06-05T07:32:11Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Bill Kong", "comment_text": "put a apfsds in there and see if you can go through a 4&quot; steel plate", "comment_date": "2022-06-05T04:16:52Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Ryan Johnstone", "comment_text": "<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=at-xZA5U1ps&amp;t=12m43s\">12:43</a> everyone flinching at the pop", "comment_date": "2022-06-05T04:16:17Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Zim Jo", "comment_text": "Shoot it on a Tank.", "comment_date": "2022-06-05T02:16:18Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "leishdawg", "comment_text": "looks like 2 shockwaves are present  in the sprinkle video", "comment_date": "2022-06-05T01:40:08Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Muhammed Mahmood", "comment_text": "This might be a bit of a reach since I don&#39;t know much about physics.

The relatively &#39;clean&#39; hole in the gong seems to be consistent with my expectations.  However, it seems the energy in the projectile is not all used up against the &#39;obstruction&#39;.  <br>I am curious about the effect of a solid steel ball the same size as the baseball.  Obviously, the initial velocity would be lessened, but the retained velocity would be greater.  I rather expect such a projectile to penetrate further into a homologous material (a hay bale or swimming pool full of water).  <br>As you may have deduced, my main hobby is firearm and ballistic research.<br>Seeing the slow-mo of the ball penetrating the gong, one is reminded of the shape factor.  The ball pushes the metal of the gong so fast the rest of the gong cannot accelerate as fast as the area directly affected.  But the round shape pushes the contact area and stretches the metal.  That interaction removes energy from the ball, reducing the velocity.  A pointed projectile will penetrate the surface, passing through and retaining more energy and velocity.  <br>It suddenly occurs to me that as a weapons designer, you already know all this.", "comment_date": "2022-04-09T15:08:35Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Rafe Zetter", "comment_text": "It&#39;s REALLY interesting why the gong barely moved on impact, if at all - I&#39;d love to know the answer why, that&#39;s the craziest bit of the video for me - there seems to be almost zero transference of kinetic energy to the gong.

Imagine a reverse eductor with vents between the center core and outer chamber, fixed spiral blades in the outer chamber to spin the air outward, preventing it from traveling forward.

So the crate would have to be quite long (deep).  You would want to set up your normal cams, but also get some additional cams, if possible, for side and rear views.  My personal take is that it would blow the crate apart, but you might try a thicker crate, maybe put steel straps around it in various locations for stability, but not so much as to impede the view of the ball as it traveled through its new medium.

Einstein, who was well regarded in his time, regretted aiding in the development of atomic weapons and said, &quot;One cannot simultaneously prevent and prepare for war.&quot; He was right, of course. Likewise, one cannot simultaneously love and kill one&#39;s enemies. Yes, there&#39;s tremendous money to be made in war and in the weapons of war. The bloated Pentagon budget, amounting to several hundred billion dollars annually, testifies to that, including how that money gets funneled into various defense contractors across the country. But the Lord also said that a man cannot love both God and mammon at the same time, any more than he can ride two donkeys heading opposite directions at the same time. If the creator of this video wants to truly impress me and also teach his son important lessons in life (lessons that will prepare him for serving the U.S. in Godly ways), then may he boldly and courageously admit the error of his ways and instead put the Lord first in all areas of his life, essentially turning swords into ploughshares and trusting in God to provide.

I read a bunch of the comments, and replied to one about the &quot;air&quot;.  <br>To the gong enthusiasts, it would actually only take 2 gongs to stop the projectile.  But that depends on how you have it set up.  <br><br>If you placed the gongs pressed up to one another bundled together, yes it might take 3-5.  Depends on how close they are, how thick the gongs are, what type/quality of metal, etc. etc.  (Hint: if you held these together with vice clamps to press them close, you should probably take cover as the vice clamps would become potential projectiles upon impact of the gong sandwich, depending on how many gongs you lined up in the sandwich.  More = less risk.)<br><br>If you have 2 gongs, on their stands, directly lined up one behind each other, it would only take 2 to stop it.  The projectile would not penetrate the 2nd gong.<br>Reason:  Upon impact of the 1st gong, most of the kinetic energy is dispersed through the remaining radius of the metal.  Because of this, when the impact occurs on the 2nd gong, there would also be approximately 1 foot of air resistance before encountering a duplicate material where the first material removed most of it&#39;s kinetic energy through dispersion transfer.  (Kinetic Energy transfer, much like electricity, will tend to take the path of least resistance, but only if certain conditions are met with KE, unlike electricity which always looks for the path of least resistance first.) <br><br>This one is interesting though, because although kinetic energy has been mostly dispersed into vibrational soundwave energy, the projectile did not lose as much velocity.  So it is entirely possible that although the ball no longer has the kinetic energy to shatter the material the gong is made out of when it comes to the 2nd gong.....  It definitely has the potential to warp it severely.  This warp could prevent any remaining kinetic energy from transferring effectively to vibrational soundwave energy.  So it is entirely possible that the 2nd gong may not make a sound at all when being hit, or rather make a very &quot;flat&quot; sound in addition to the very result of the impact on the 2nd gong being the cause as to why it doesn&#39;t penetrate it........ interesting.  Well I hope they try it.<br><br>To the Captain America shield fans... ya... that&#39;s a no.  Assuming Vibranium possesses the qualities of absorbing vibrational kinetic energy on the level of what a tectonic plate shift would produce overall before the wielder &quot;feels it&quot;... The baseball would shatter upon impact of the shield and it would look like a stiff breeze moved the shield slightly.   Remember this thing can take artillery shell impacts and not have a scratch on it.  A baseball moving at supersonic speeds is similar to an artillery shell impact, but far less dense and made out of a much softer material.   :)<br><br>Alternatively, a more interesting theory I have is that a round shield made out of iron/composite would hold up better than say a Kite shield of the same material.  Both are curved and meant to deflect impacts, but I believe the overall uniform shape of the shield would have more of a resistive effect in this instance rather than the material.<br><br>Finally, the maximum speed you can impact a gong with to make a sound depends on the material you hit it with, material of the gong, and how much vibration the struck material can handle before reaching a stress point where the material breaks down.  Size of the gong and mallet matters also, they must be relative to each other.  My theory is that the maximum hit speed (with it&#39;s relative counterpart striker, and NOT a baseball) should be about 775 mph, or just slightly over the speed of sound before you damage the gong to where it will not make the correct vibrational sound any longer.  <br><br>Anyway.

Not that its wise to discuss on the internet, but your standard granulated sugar and some weed killers (which I will not name for obvious reasons) can make some pretty potent chemicals which will ignite with interesting results, so rather than providing a chemical oxidiser, you compress them, which causes them to crack or become powder, which is ejected from the container, the initial shockwave of the baseball which you said was in excess of 1.5 mach might well be enough to create the compression necessary to burn the resulting powder, which could cause the flash and shockwave.

The force of the impact and the force of the propulsion meeting at the edge of the baseball as it bursts gives a minor Shockwave(soundwave) due to the buildup of the rubberbanding reverberating inside.

The sitting ball will have to have the ability to move so a ridged track set up with the sitting ball at the very edge of the front end of the rack so that the flying ball will hit it squarely.<br>What should happen is the flying ball upon hitting the moveable sitting ball should lose most of its energy transferring it to the sitting ball which will then act as if it was now shot from the pneumatic cannon.<br>Another experiment would be to set up a series of sitting balls on the long track with spacing between them of say, a meter apart and let the energy transfer from one to the other.<br>The last ball would then or should then go from zero to whatever the diminished energy will allow it to travel.<br>A clocking device could be used to check the velocity.<br>Ok, thinking more about it...................a ball container filled with water so that the water stays in tact to the target.<br>In the military, we used IV bags between the C4 and the object we were trying to blast open.

I was trying to see if there&#39;s going to happen in the next object which isthe gong plate metal musical instrumet for sacred use and im sure it did happen in that too but maybe the reflection of metal object and of mirror in a day light couldn&#39;t become so visible....please repeat it for the last two object in a dark room to see if the sparks would be bigger...THANKS!!! love you work of all your team!!!

This makes sense, as a lot of the mathematics for liquids is derived from early military calculations for bullet and shell penetration of armour. However, at later timescales the breakup was very distinct, whereas in water or oil we would expect to see a  sheet, that with time breaks up under Rayleigh-Taylor instability However, with the silly putty, you could see that the crown material had already broken up into clumps.

If you look there is a flash preceding the shock wave. My guess would be that there is a thermal bloom at the moment impact as kinetic energy dumps into the mass and heat is created at such speed that the thermal bloom radiating out from the point of impact is causing your shock wave. It just a guess but based on my understanding of ballistic impacts the initial impact causes heat as the molecules are accelerated in the target and they rub against each other. I remember a video about why they use aluminum in armored trucks instead of steel, it\u2019s because the impact of the bullet causes a brief moment when the aluminum heats up and absorbs energy more like a liquid allowing more energy to propagate though a greater area reducing penetration. The part that stuck with me was the heat created by the impact would effectively allow a projectile to burn through steel, where the aluminum could absorb the heat energy into the armor plate. I think that wave we see in the noise is a thermal bloom.", "comment_date": "2021-12-10T02:12:32Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Justin Case", "comment_text": "Why didn&#39;t you mention the baseball bouncing back along the line of flight after it hit the sprinkles?

The only part that&#39;s been bugging me is that I can&#39;t think of a way to use only electric power to break the sound barrier in an aircraft (other than a mag-lev train in a vacuum maybe).

Since a noise reduction program/algorithm is designed to reduce light imperfections in a frame, I would guess that the program is confusing the shock wave with noise/imperfections and it is smoothing it all out using known, good pixels and causing you to lose small details.<br><br>This just a guess, I&#39;m the furthest person away from being a camera expert. I just know that the best way to reduce digital noise in a camera shot is to add more light, either by re-framing, artificially adding more light, or by allowing more light to hit the sensor (opening up the aperture).", "comment_date": "2021-12-09T04:47:39Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Cortana Rosy", "comment_text": "Anyone else see the spark at <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=at-xZA5U1ps&amp;t=5m24s\">5:24</a>?", "comment_date": "2021-12-09T04:43:48Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Paul Tollenaar", "comment_text": "Dang it!

The reason each sprinkle split appart because the compressive impulse imparted to it, travels through the sprinkle. When the compressive impulse wave reaches the edge of the sprinkle that is not in contact with another that it can transfer energy to, it is reflected internally as a tensile wave. These waves propergate and are reflected in-turn as compressive waves. This process repeats until the energy is dissipated. Due to the shape of the object, the patterns of reflective waves become very complex. Where two or more waves cross paths, the amplitude is cumulative. When the amplitute of tensile waves are greater than the tensile strength of the material, a fracture will occur. The waves continue to reflect and ocilate between compressive and tensile waves within the remaining pieces and they may fracture too. The mechanics of reflecting compressive/tensile waves can be observed in a Newton&#39;s Craddle. It is the same reason that when a projectile hits a brittle material, material spalls out the back side of the material. The British navy used to classify the power of a cannon by shooting a cannon ball at the end of a log and counting how many times the log fractured. It would be amazing if you could do this with your baseball cannon! <br><br>Kind Regards<br><br>Dom", "comment_date": "2021-12-08T03:08:18Z", "likes_count": 119}, {"comment_by": "rchandraonline", "comment_text": "My theory was that while the ball is travelling, lots of electrons are being ripped off it by air, and the light is static discharge.", "comment_date": "2021-12-08T03:08:02Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Gregory Squires", "comment_text": "Destin, is it not the shock wave that makes the sprinkles explode??

These nano fibrils form aligned structure at the joints and a messed up random puff at every 85.6 micro meter on the thread. This randomness makes the puff have a higher free surface energy and more wetability. As the temperature of environment around the spider web falls below dew point, water starts condensing on the silk threads. The puffs transform to spindle like structures (Like two cones connected at their bases with the axis running through the silk thread).

The shattering of the glass seems impossibly fast: I can watch really fast moving objects with your phantom recordings but I can&#39;t seem to watch a crack forming in glass. One moment there&#39;s no crack, the next there&#39;s all kinds of cracks all the way from the impact point to every side of the glass. <br><br>This video there was a difference: At <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=at-xZA5U1ps&amp;t=19m40s\">19:40</a> (31.333 ms) if you go frame by frame you can see what looks like a perfectly circle of cracks in all directions for a split second, before there are again cracks all the way to the edge of the glass. Now I don&#39;t know if that&#39;s just due to the recording or if there are other reasons. If I had to take I guess I think the perfect circle of cracks is due to the mirror actually caving in when the baseball hits, and the rest of the cracks are the resulting stress fractures. <br><br>If I&#39;ve got you wondering the same thing now and you want to do a video, I&#39;ve got four basic questions:<br>#1: How fast does a crack in glass &quot;travel&quot;?  It really seems very fast: 31.267 ms = impact? 31.333 ms = perfect circle of cracks covering 1/4? of the mirror. 31.400 ms = visible cracks across the entire mirror. <br>#2: Does the crack &quot;travel&quot; at all? In other words can you see a crack start somewhere and work it&#39;s way in a direction, or does a crack (at least visibly) form along it&#39;s entire length simultaneously.<br>#3: Is there any use to this knowledge aside from it being really cool to learn about God&#39;s creation?<br>#4: Prince Rupert&#39;s drops obviously behave differently, since they are smelted differently and I&#39;ve actually seen the shattering travel along a prince Rupert&#39;s drop in your videos. So my question is: Do cracks travel faster or slower in panned glass or a Prince Rupert&#39;s drop? Do Prince Rupert&#39;s drops even crack, or is there some kind of difference in terminology and effect in the way a Prince Rupert&#39;s drop breaks as compared to a normal glass pane?<br><br>If that&#39;s not enough I&#39;ve got three more questions about glass shattering:<br><br>#5: Why do most cracks intersect either with an edge or another crack but a very few have one end be floating free? Also, why is it always only one end? Why can&#39;t I ever recall glass having just a floating crack where both ends don&#39;t touch either the edge of the glass or another crack? Also if you look at 31.800 ms, on the left hand side there a larger shard with two such &quot;one ended&quot; cracks and a very small gap in between them. How in the world did those two cracks not propagate into each other?<br>#6: Why are glass shards almost always pointed at at least one point on their circumference (i.e Pizza slice shaped) and sharp enough to cut as well? How come you don&#39;t hear about dull glass shards? Do dull glass shards exist? <br>#7: Why do some areas of a shattering glass pane get covered in dozens of cracks while others are simply large shards with few to no cracks? Is it simply due to varying material strength or is it due to the way the stress propagates through the glass? An example can be seen at 31.800 ms on the right side, there are three larger shards with strips of dozens of cracks between each of the larger shards.<br><br>Now I realize I could look up a good chunk of this online but I figure if you do a video on it then I may learn more and thousands of other people get to learn as well ;)<br><br>Keep it up Destin, your videos embody my desire to learn about the world.

I would love to see that in your slow mo cam, and even better I would love to see this cannon completely shatter it!", "comment_date": "2021-12-07T20:58:46Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Mark Lindsey", "comment_text": "Did you notice the spark at frame 1.787 at time <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=at-xZA5U1ps&amp;t=5m24s\">5:24</a>?

If you look at the sprinkles as the ball is starting to go through the container, look at the first sprinkles that start to explode then start looking at the sprinkles touching it and you\u2019ll see that they are still mostly intact until the the first sprinkles are disintegrated at which point the next sprinkles are disintegrated and so on until they are all mostly dust. <br><br>That and when the ball first hits the container, but before it explodes, the container builds up internal pressure which causes the sprinkles to be under much more than atmospheric pressure. Since they are fairly ridged and brittle, the extra pressure starts to crush them before the Newtons cradle effect comes in to play. <br><br>Finally, since these are going faster than the speed of sound, I\u2019m thinking the pressure at the front of the ball is assisting everything I just mentioned. <br><br>Now I wonder if the sprinkles will act the same way in a non-airtight container. Perhaps put them in a ziplock bag with gussets (fill it all the way to the top and leave the zipper open all the way) then put cheesecloth or something like that on top of it so most of the sprinkles are still forced to go through their container. Then try and see if you can build something to hold an open pile of sprinkles and see how they act like that too. <br><br>I\u2019m sure that I am not the only one here that would love to see that comparison. <br><br>I would like to add one thing, I am not a scientist so take what I said with a grain of salt.

Therefore, you and your team should build something like a &quot;jet-engine thrust reverser.&quot; The main point of this thrust reverser or let us call it a pressurized air converter is to convert the pressurized air to both sides so it would not destroy the outcome of baseball damage on any certain object. For instance, in today&#39;s video, the baseball punctured the gong and it was standing still just fine until that high-pressurized airwave came and hit the gong sending it flying and then got destroyed. If there was a pressurized air converter, the gong would not be destroyed.  <br>Hope this idea of a pressurized air converter would help to make this experiment extra informative and more enjoyable. <br>Cheers and God bless you all.", "comment_date": "2021-12-07T17:21:59Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "HamSandvich", "comment_text": "You\u2019re gonna try to send a baseball to space aren\u2019t you", "comment_date": "2021-12-07T17:21:50Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "OvAeons", "comment_text": "Second mirror fainted at the demise of their brother. o7 Godspeed mirrorlad", "comment_date": "2021-12-07T17:21:47Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "thorbalt1", "comment_text": "Watch the gong and mirror hit at .25 playback speed", "comment_date": "2021-12-07T17:21:41Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "BFG", "comment_text": "Every time I see that flash of fire on impact my mind is blown.", "comment_date": "2021-12-07T17:21:41Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Paris Edwards", "comment_text": "I called it in the last video....!", "comment_date": "2021-12-07T17:21:33Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Charles Nolan", "comment_text": "So, my 2 cents<br><br>Add a vacuum collection tube adjacent to the cymbal and collect vaporized metal", "comment_date": "2021-12-07T17:21:27Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "ShaRk.", "comment_text": "About the droplets on the web:<br>There is an effect called Rayleigh Instability combined with capillary forces - amazing stuff!", "comment_date": "2021-12-07T17:21:27Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Anton Kovalenko", "comment_text": "<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=at-xZA5U1ps&amp;t=5m24s\">5:24</a> - There was a spark right before collision<br><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=at-xZA5U1ps&amp;t=8m44s\">8:44</a> - Another spark seen as well", "comment_date": "2021-12-07T17:21:25Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "BeholdtheWizard", "comment_text": "I would love to see this again but with a full set of bowling pins, just to see how fast you can make a strike on a go", "comment_date": "2021-12-07T17:21:16Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Fernando", "comment_text": "What is the flash I see when the ball hits the sprinkles?", "comment_date": "2021-12-07T17:21:14Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Kuulastic", "comment_text": "Anyone else thinking titanium gong?", "comment_date": "2021-12-07T17:20:55Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "paul p", "comment_text": "After all of the slow motion footage I have seen over the years, I am still left wondering , what if someone would stop the wind after the shot.

It&#39;s probably an evolutionary thing that helped spiders get water without risking drowning. Surface tension is a big issue when you&#39;re that small, the surface tension of the water is higher than the force you can exert to pull yourself out, so if one part gets wetted, you&#39;re going to get stuck, many araneomorphs get their air through spiracles, rather than book lungs, so even if they do get out of a puddle, they&#39;re going to drown, or at least be a lot slower. Not having to go to the ground for water also means they&#39;re less likely to get stepped on or hunted by ground predators, at least when they&#39;re in their webs, birds usually stay clear of them. <br>I have observed the same silk wetting phenonmenon with my mygalomorph spiders, both tarantulaes and funnelwebs, but to a lesser extent. though the tarantula&#39;s web seems to have something soluble in it, which acts as a surfactant, allowing the water to basically turn into a bubble and cover the gap between the web, I&#39;ve seen her drink from it. She&#39;s a desert tarantula, so maybe something to do with stopping moisture from leaving her burrow, or efficient collection of dew? She still has a water dish and she will drink from that if I haven&#39;t misted her cage in a while. But it&#39;s a really cool phenomenon, I&#39;d like to check how other webs react, but I can only get native Australian spiders here.<br><br>TL;DR it&#39;s just that only certain points on the silk strand are easily wetted, all the dew that forms flows to those points, if they oversaturate, they drop off.", "comment_date": "2021-12-07T17:15:43Z", "likes_count": 316}, {"comment_by": "Orlando Olmo", "comment_text": "Maybe next a baseball railgun?", "comment_date": "2021-12-07T17:15:41Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Giovanni", "comment_text": "Best video of the year", "comment_date": "2021-12-07T17:15:34Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Danny Judge", "comment_text": "Is there somewhere I can buy a base ball that has gone mock one?
