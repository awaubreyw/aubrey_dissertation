[{"comment_by": "SmarterEveryDay", "comment_text": "Note: The US Navy put no restrictions on me about what I should say or how I should present what I learned on this trip. Other than making sure my footage was cleared for Operational Security, I am free to say whatever I want about this experience.  And here is what I want to say:<br><br>This was an absolutely incredible experience.  The Navy personnel and Academic Research Scientists who kept me safe were incredibly professional.  Every person I met was exceptional.  Also, can I just say that the experience of going underway in a submarine was INCREDIBLE.  I&#39;m still trying to decide how I want to release the footage (when I receive the last of it after it&#39;s been OPSEC cleared).  Right now I&#39;m leaning towards a series of videos similar to a Smarter Every Day Deep Dive on the submarines. The name is certainly fitting! <br><br>I&#39;ve also given a lot of thought to recent events here at home and around the world.  It occurs to me that the US Navy brings stability and security to the world in a very unique way these days.  I&#39;m grateful that I had the opportunity to meet these individuals so I now know how professional these people are.<br><br>I also want to say thank you to people who support Smarter Every Day on Patreon.  My goal is to make intelligent, humble, respectful content.  I was given approval for this experience provided I could purchase all the necessary cold weather gear and find a way to get there.  Patrons of Smarter Every Day made that happen, so thank you to everyone who partners with me to make this kind of content by supporting at <a href=\"https://www.patreon.com/smartereveryday\">https://www.patreon.com/smartereveryday</a>.

It knows this because it knows where it isn&#39;t. By subtracting where it is from where it isn&#39;t, or where it isn&#39;t from where it is (whichever is greater), it obtains a difference, or deviation. The navigation subsystem uses deviations to generate corrective commands to drive the submarine from a position where it is to a position where it isn&#39;t, and arriving at a position where it wasn&#39;t, it now is. Consequently, the position where it is, is now the position that it wasn&#39;t, and it follows that the position that it was, is now the position that it isn&#39;t.\r<br>In the event that the position that it is in is not the position that it wasn&#39;t, the system has acquired a variation, the variation being the difference between where the submarine is, and where it wasn&#39;t. If variation is considered to be a significant factor, it too may be corrected by the acoustic navigation and communication system. However, the submarine must also know where it was.\r<br>The submarine navigation computer scenario works as follows. Because a variation has modified some of the information the submarine has obtained, it is not sure just where it is. However, it is sure where it isn&#39;t, within reason, and it knows where it was. It now subtracts where it should be from where it wasn&#39;t, or vice-versa, and by differentiating this from the algebraic sum of where it shouldn&#39;t be, and where it was, it is able to obtain the deviation and its variation, which is called error.", "comment_date": "2020-10-29T19:55:36Z", "likes_count": 135}, {"comment_by": "psycronizer", "comment_text": "<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5d6SEQQbwtU&amp;t=13m22s\">13:22</a>...a twin otter.....I didn&#39;t see any otters ? maybe they are hidden under the ice or something....", "comment_date": "2020-10-27T23:44:55Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "drew nabors", "comment_text": "Finger Rafting, wetness guaranteed!", "comment_date": "2020-10-27T20:33:33Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "kent teo", "comment_text": "Andy&#39;s lips looks like he is from the country part", "comment_date": "2020-10-27T08:50:38Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Robert Nelson", "comment_text": "Me a cannadian: ameturs", "comment_date": "2020-10-24T03:49:59Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Deplorable Dave", "comment_text": "&quot;We as Americans are in a tumultuous time of change.

Now gird up your loins like a man, and I ask you, and you answer Me. Where were you when I laid the foundations of the earth? Declare, if you have understanding. Who set its measurements, if you know? Or who stretched the line upon it? Upon what were its foundations sunk? Or who laid its corner-stone, when the morning stars sang together, and all the sons of Elohim shouted for joy? Or who enclosed the sea with doors, when it burst forth and came from the womb; when I made the clouds its garment, and thick darkness its swaddling band; and assigned for it My law, and set bars and doors; and said, \u2018This far you have come, but no farther, and here your proud waves stop?\u2019 Have you ever commanded the morning, and caused the dawn to know its place, to take hold of the ends of the earth, and the wrong be shaken out of it? It is changed like clay under a seal, and they stand out like a garment. And their light is withheld from the wrong, and the arm lifted up is broken. Have you come to the sources of the sea? Or have you walked about in the recesses of the deep? Were the gates of death revealed to you? Or have you seen the gates of the shadow of death? Have you understood the breadth of the earth? Declare, if you know it all. Where is the way to the dwelling of light? And darkness, where is its place, that you should take it to its boundary, and know the paths to its home? Do you know? For you would have been born then, and the number of your days been many! Have you entered into the storehouses of snow, or have you seen the storehouses of hail, which I have kept for the time of distress, for the day of fighting and battle? Where is the way that light is divided, or the east wind scattered over the earth? Who has cleft a channel for the overflowing water, or a way for the thunderclaps to make rain fall on land where no one is, a wilderness in which there is no man; to satisfy the wild and waste places, and to make the seeds of grass to sprout? Does the rain have a father? Or who has brought forth the drops of dew? From whose belly comes the ice? And who gave birth to the frost of the heavens? The waters harden like stone, and the surface of the deep is frozen. Do you bind the bands of Kimah, or loosen the cords of Kesil? Do you bring out the Mazzaroth/ constellations in its season? Or do you lead the Bear with its sons? Do you know the Torah/ laws of the Shamayim/ heavens? Or do you set their rule over the earth? Do you lift up your voice to the clouds, so that floods of water cover you? Do you send out lightnings, and they go and say to you, \u2018Here we are!\u2019? Who has put wisdom in the inward parts? Or who has given understanding to the heart? Who has wisdom to count the clouds, or to tip over the bottles of the heavens, when the dust hardens in clumps, and the clods cling together? Do you hunt the prey for the lion, or satisfy the appetite of the young lions, when they crouch in dens, sit in the cover of their hiding place?

They are indeed caused by ice crystals in the air and create a pattern of light at specific angles (22 degrees) relative to the sun and at the same vertical angle, due to the refractive index of ice.  The refracted light then reflects off other ice crystals toward the viewer, similar to how rainbows work, and in certain conditions can form a halo all the way around the sun or moon.  Similar effects at different refractive indexes in clouds and atmospheric ice conditions create things called light pillars, sun pillars, moon halos. The science behind this is quite interesting and creates beautiful and spectacular images.  Check out the Astronomy Picture of the Day (apod) website which contains a huge archive of scientifically curated and described images, mostly space images but lots of atmospheric phenomena too.

I will say on big lakes like Lake Erie it dangerous to go out unless there is a lot of ice because it moves so much. I was taught never to go out on less than 5 inches but I believe 3 can hold a person(though then any little change and you have trouble). I was also taught to never go near the finger rafting spots, I have only even seen them on Lake Erie( maybe smaller lake don&#39;t move the ice enough to see them), but I was always taught that when the ice goes over itself like that you no longer know where the ice is strong. So potentially you could be walking along on double the normal ice thickness and then there will be a void where the ice is only an inch thick and you wouldn&#39;t be able to tell. Also they tend to get stuck together and not want to separate so when the ice moves again they can cause big tear to happen and you could have open water between you and shore. Anyways I am no expert was taught this by my fisherman father and grandfather, cool video hope some one finds this interesting.", "comment_date": "2020-06-15T09:43:26Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Deano", "comment_text": "Sundogs at 7.35 = awesome!", "comment_date": "2020-06-15T09:43:09Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "George Bulbakwa", "comment_text": "I love how you manage to get in these interesting situations and we get to see it through your presentations.

As I waited outside the Fairbanks airport for my ride, I had to strip down to my short sleeves. With no moisture in the air and no wind, even a simple leather jacket was too warm. On the other side of that, the warm snap meant winds at Ft. Greely were up to 50 mph gusts. The wind whipping between buildings could literally suck the breath out of you. You learn to appreciate the -30\u00b0F temps, as when it&#39;s cold, the wind is minimal. You can dress in layers for the cold, but a 25+ mph wind will cut right through your clothing.

You must remember we live in a world where the vast number of communities in this world no matter how rich and now matter how lively and vibrant can be snuffed out due to political convenience without respect for human life. And these are tragedies that must be avoided at all cost. This is my view point both as someone who has served in the US military and as a US citizen, no matter the competition or enemy I do not wish to see them annihilated by nuclear force. However this reality is what also keeps military expansion from powerful nations in check. If China invaded India in an egregious manner that deeply threatened their national security Beijing would be removed from the face of the earth by nuclear force and vis a vis for Delhi. I deeply hope this never occurs. So regardless of a deep aversion there is a profound necessity to maintain this condition where all human life on the planet can be wiped out in 2 hours. Because the reality becomes apparent human life is worthless as we remain divided and secure when cooperation can be achieved as an ultimatum. It is a death pact of sorts where anyone that wants global domination at the tremendous expense of human life can be denied. The what-about-isms of various nuclear powers committing abuses such as Russia in the Ukraine, the US in Iraq, and China among almost all of it&#39;s neighboring countries are meaningless as this abuse of power is ubiquitous and must be deterred by free and powerful democracies which two of those nations lack and hence are unaccountable by their own people. I believe voters denying the warmonger Hillary Clinton is evident that the US people are overtly leaning towards military de-escalation and changing policy reflects that barring instigation (example: by political radicals such as groups within the Iranian government who would not care if they annihilated themselves out of spite). The only true defeat of nuclear weapons is not decrying their existence but removing the conditions we set for ourselves that necessitate them. If there were no need for any of us to commit to militaristic expansion there would be no need for nuclear weapons except for extra-planetary threats.<br><br>edit: This did not age well. A few days after this post there was a confrontation between India and China that resulted in the deaths of +40 CCP soldiers and 20 Indian soldiers. The impetus for this not escalating further is the fact that both these nations possess nuclear weapons and the devastating effect a failure to resolve this matter would cause.", "comment_date": "2020-06-14T21:09:36Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Christiaan Scholte", "comment_text": "Awesome", "comment_date": "2020-06-14T21:09:07Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Definite CLO", "comment_text": "Noone:<br>Camera: <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5d6SEQQbwtU&amp;t=31m27s\">31:27</a>", "comment_date": "2020-06-14T21:09:02Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "The Slimy FX", "comment_text": "iSex - now in apple stores", "comment_date": "2020-06-14T21:09:01Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "jatinore", "comment_text": "imagine having your video sponsored by the us navy", "comment_date": "2020-06-14T21:08:56Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "PhantomPanic", "comment_text": "<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5d6SEQQbwtU&amp;t=18m54s\">18:54</a> Didn&#39;t hear a single word due to checking out those Hawaiian Rolls over there on that table...", "comment_date": "2020-06-14T21:08:20Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Jess Hallsworth", "comment_text": "The rainbow you saw around the sun are called Sun Dogs.

How should we go about militarizing this niche environment? While the US, Russia, and our allies have poured billions of dollars into ships that can operate in the arctic, they have been wildly unsuccessful overall (because of the need to cut ice, because ice moves, etc). Subs, on the other hand, operate much better. Does US arctic militarization just provoke Russia, kinda like an arctic arms race, even as we justify it as necessary protection against Russian invasion and expansion? Is the cost of putting our people in harms way by having them operate in such extreme environments actually justified by the benefit?

We had scientists on board with a supercomputer (probably slower than my phone today)  that studied how sound traveled under the ice. Possibly  research that led in part to these experiments today. Once our duties with ICEX ended, we headed to the North Pole and surfaced through 6 feet of ice. We surfaced thru the ice 10 times during the trip. I was at the helm for 4 surfaces and 6 dives. I was at the stern planes when we dove at the Pole. We were frozen in place and had to bring in over 40,000lbs of seawater before we broke through. We then sank straight down like a 40,000lb rock. We were at 400&#39; before we even started to slow down and didn&#39;t completely catch it until 800&#39;.

By tradition they should be addressing you also as &quot;sir&quot; and probably most of the enlisted did, but you are just one of those types of individuals with which everyone wants to be on a first name basis.

To be sure, we would expect parties to benefit from any voluntary transaction between them. However, Mr. Sandlin has at two points during the video, once near the beginning and once near the end, emphasized the moneyless and uncensorsed aspects of his ICEX experience. This is partly (and almost certainly unintentionally) misleading, as something of value <i>has</i> been exchanged: access to rare and appealing information. The U.S. Navy has granted Mr. Sandlin, a professional YouTuber, a monetizable commodity in exchange for its own ends, which, I suspect, are positive domestic publicity and impactful soft diplomacy. <br><br>Furthermore, although Mr. Sandlin writes that<br>        &quot;The US Navy put no restrictions on me about what I should say or how I should present what I learned on this trip.<br>        Other than making sure my footage was cleared for Operational Security, I am free to say whatever I want about this experience.&quot;<br>Sandlin&#39;s career as a missile-flight test engineer and his many previous YouTube videos about military matters were, I believe, part of the reason the Navy invited Mr. Sandlin to view its Arctic base and operations. Sandlin&#39;s expressed opinions about the United States Armed Forces have been primarily favorable, and so, athough it was something of a calculated risk, Navy decision-makers likely concluded that no overt content restrictions (aside from OpSec, which is a form of censorship) were necessary. In effect, censorship occurred (benign and innocuous though it may have been), not after Mr. Sandlin&#39;s filming via restrictions on footage content, but during the selection of Mr. Sandlin himself.", "comment_date": "2020-06-14T18:04:42Z", "likes_count": 6}, {"comment_by": "Darren's workshop", "comment_text": "What a trip...wow.", "comment_date": "2020-06-14T18:04:38Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Jon Potynski", "comment_text": "<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5d6SEQQbwtU&amp;t=16m17s\">16:17</a> Destin getting absolutely swerved", "comment_date": "2020-06-14T18:04:36Z", "likes_count": 2}, {"comment_by": "Shipmate86", "comment_text": "Yooo, Dollaga was one of my first CO&#39;s on my first Sub.", "comment_date": "2020-06-14T18:04:30Z", "likes_count": 2}, {"comment_by": "JS K", "comment_text": "American exceptionalism must be continued.

The way you introduce the cooperation with the navy for this video makes me think that this won&#39;t be an independent and balanced video, and instead another instance of the military industrial complex showing of thier toys on civilian channels in order to facilitate an image that is far from the actual truth. Videos like this are possible because the US spends more on its military then on any other thing apart from Wall Street bailouts. Whilst a lot of us have been outside protesting the actions of a increasingly fascist government threatening to use this very military on its own people, you perpetuate the lie that this military is somehow fighting for the peace and rights of every viewer. Its not. Weapon systems like this are used to wage imperialistic wars and imtimidate other countries until they don&#39;t hate the states. I know that this was an incredible opportunity that you wanted to take. But as a viewer, I feel like this content rn is supporting a system I can no longer support.

I do totally understand and share your excitement for all the science and technology. However, I\u00b4m concerned about the way you are talking about the military. <br>Especially in times like these, where millions loose there jobs, tens of thousands die and good education isn\u00b4t available for many, it becomes obvious, that the real danger for the people isn\u00b4t originating from some foreign powers and countries. Huge investments in the social systems, public health care, public education and combating the climate catastrophe are urgent to do something about the problems and dangers people are facing every day and that are only becoming more problematic in the future. Instead, money is wastefully being poured into the military. <br>To make it worse, arming the military doesn\u00b4t actually help keeping peace, it achieves the contrary. It\u00b4s the old intimidation technique that was used during the cold war. Party A stocks up their military to intimidate party B. That forces party B to upgrade their military as well to be equally or even more powerful than party A. Party A then feels pressured to increase their military again and the play continues. It\u00b4s like a spiral, just like we saw during the cold war. But the more powerful each party grows, the more tense the situation gets. If a conflict actually erupts, the consequences of a shooting war become more and more devastating for all of humanity. So instead of trying to intimidate each other, we should really try to disarm and shrink all military to a minimum size that might still be necessary to protect us from potential terrorist attacks etc. We should but our focus in cooperating with other countries and try to get a good relationship so that we stop feeling like we have to intimidate each other! War usually creates more problems than it \u201csolves\u201d, if it does actually solve any.<br>Also, especially being out on the arctic sea ice, which is declining every year due to the effects of the climate crisis, praising one of the single largest CO2 emitters, the US military, seems pretty strange. If the US military was a country, it would be within the top 60 of the most CO2 emitting ones. So, investing in the military actually threatens the future of the very people it is sworn to protect.<br>I cannot understand how someone like you, dedicated to science and understanding the world using observations and facts, is praising an organization without questioning it or taking different view points into consideration. But I do think I understand where you are coming from. Of course, being part of a nation with the strongest military in the world that defends you from all those enemies must feel great and does make for a nice story. But that is not the reality. Reality is complex. With other scientific topics you are able to communicate that complexity really well. So Why not here? I do not expect you to agree with my opinion, but you could really build criticism into your coverage and allow for different points of view. After all, how do you plan to become \u201csmarter\u201d without questioning?<br>Your sincerely,<br>Julius", "comment_date": "2020-06-14T17:30:39Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "MikeBramm", "comment_text": "Very, very cool (literally) stuff.

My submarine story centers around a visit with my uncle when he was stationed in Key West when I was 10 years old. I was able to visit the Trutta and was allowed the opportunity to use its periscope to view the surrounding area. The highlight of that experience was to view the heavily guarded USS Nautilus (SSN-571), the first nuclear powered submarine. Thankfully nothing happened when I requested to fire a torpedo at the Nautilus. A boy&#39;s imagination. Seeing the Nautilus was a foreshadowing of my future career.

BUT, It&#39;s kind of gross :P I spat today in my sink, which left a strand between the drain hole! But eventually the strand became VERY VERY thin, then building large bulbs of saliva in the middle, all the while being thin! I blew on it to see if it would break and to my surprise it stayed in tact, I came back almost an hour later for it to still be there! HOW WOULD THIS WORK, anyways love your work Destin thank you so much!", "comment_date": "2020-06-14T16:06:33Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Cowabunga Nibba", "comment_text": "trumps birth days today", "comment_date": "2020-06-14T16:06:32Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "LeSkunk_", "comment_text": "<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5d6SEQQbwtU&amp;t=26m18s\">26:18</a> camera is being a little funky", "comment_date": "2020-06-14T16:06:24Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "ExplodingONC", "comment_text": "&quot;Providing security and stability across the entire world&quot;?

The American culture is heavily influenced by the military, weapons lobby and so on, but the feeling that you gave me and I think others too, just two minutes into the video was:<br>There is a real threat out there that could attack the US and bring the whole world back to much worse times. Like a new cold war. I honour people, all over the world dedicate their lives to protect others/the country. This needs courage and bravery, but I think humans need to change to a society that is not solving their problems with threatening others with bigger military, violence or other ways of brutality.<br>I mean you just said it, this video was filmed before the death of George Floyd, but especially the US culture is a very violent one. You as an influencer and YouTuber with 8,3 million subscribers need to think about the content you are creating. Sure you are doing a ton of work for every video. <br>The videos I most like from you are those where I learn fascinating new stuff, physics or other things, but this is the second time I&#39;m really questioning your choice of content. Sure it is cool how you board a nuclear submarine in the arctic, and sure there are a lot of interesting high skilled humans on board, but defending the constitution against what, who? <br>Where is the enemy? Russia? Chinese? Europa?<br>Humans living in other countries with other Socalstructures have the same wishes then everyone else.
