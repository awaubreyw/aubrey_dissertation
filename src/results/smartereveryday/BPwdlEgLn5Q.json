The reflected blast wave merges with the incident shock wave to form a single wave, known as the Mach Stem. The overpressure at the front of the Mach wave is generally about twice as great as that at the direct blast wave front (Sandia NL). Reflective overpressure is often experienced by any shooter or explosive breacher with experience shooting indoors - walls, floors, ceiling, all act as a reflective surface. Never stand in corners or at the end of a hallway where the reflective overpressure multiplies exponentially...drop you to your knees, headache for days.

Almost all of your footages contain two separate but identical schlieren pattern, if your setup is correct, they should overlap. Base on my own experience from playing with schlieren optics, this is probably because your light source, razor blade and your camera are not perfectly aligned with the optical axis of your parabolic mirror. My solution to this problem is to stick the light source on the razor blade(to make them as close to each other as possible), then put them directly in front of the lens.

The shockwaves along the curved bullet body (at subsonic) is because of its shape and how air accelerates over curved shapes, hence how airplanes fly.  &quot;Moving out of the way&quot; is a poor way to describe that effect.  This is why subsonic jets fly in the Mach .85 range as around the nose, top of the wings, and other curved surfaces, the air travels more quickly and that faster flow also has to stay subsonic.  If that was a straight cylinder you would not see the shockwaves.  Also the position of the body shockwaves are at the regions of greatest change of curvature which demonstrates my point.

A few clarifying points (which you may already know):<br><br>1) When using the Mach angle to measure the speed, make sure to measure the angle far away from the object. Since a Mach wave is the weak limit of a shock, the shape of the shock will only approach that of a Mach wave once the distance away from the object is several times the characteristic length scale of the object. Think of it as moving far enough away that the object can be treated as a point mass. If you measure too close, your measurement will be influenced by the local curvature of the bow shock.<br><br>2) For the subsonic round, what you&#39;re observing is indeed a normal shock. However, the object doesn&#39;t have to be traveling at transonic speeds for this to happen. The transonic Mach regime is not a rigidly defined range of Mach numbers. The phenomenon you observed is caused by exceeding the critical Mach number. Critical Mach number is the free stream Mach number at which some point in the flow has a local Mach number &gt;= 1. For a slender object like a bullet, this will occur in the 0.8 - 1.2 Mach range, but a more blunt or otherwise oddly shaped object may have a critical Mach number well below 0.8. So the behavior you saw is a function of the free stream Mach number AND the shape of the object.", "comment_date": "2019-01-19T17:32:37Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Ahmed LAHLOU", "comment_text": "You beat the slomoguys on this one!", "comment_date": "2019-01-18T19:03:01Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Ahmed LAHLOU", "comment_text": "Love the video, Love the barrett, hate that short barrel of it", "comment_date": "2019-01-18T18:22:07Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Beloroth", "comment_text": "Great video!

C) Both of the cases mentioned above (case A and B).\r<br>\r<br>What is known about the UFO phenomena? \r<br>Well, we know from radar (radar on ground and air), gimball fighter-jet camera footage, mass sightings, eye witness accounts from trained observers (Pilots, astronauts ect.) - That these UFO/flying saucers can accelerate from a hovering state with no movement, to speeds well above multiple times the speed of sound in about 1 second. With these velocities they make 90 degree turns like a pingpong ball bouncing of a wall. The public should look into these studies and all the data.

The formula is then $$\\tan{\\theta}=\\frac{2\\cot{\\beta}(M^2\\sin^2{\\beta}-1)}{(\\gamma+1)M^2-2(M\\sin^2{\\beta}-1)}$$, where $M$ is the Mach number of the incoming flow and $\\gamma$ the ratio of specific heats (1.4 for air), but the result is most easily read off a diagram. &quot;Anderson, John D.: Modern Compressible Flow&quot; seems to be a good resource.", "comment_date": "2018-11-10T14:30:52Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "SirDella", "comment_text": "<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BPwdlEgLn5Q&amp;t=6m50s\">6:50</a>", "comment_date": "2018-11-10T13:43:46Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "LaxHead14", "comment_text": "Didn&#39;t Felix Baumgartner break the speed of sound in his free fall?

I assumed the bullet went in front of the center of the mirror, and the center of the mirror was 8 inches off the table and 54 inches off the floor. I also assumed the bullet was traveling at 2800 feet per second. Lastly, I very roughly calculated the angle of the shock wave at 30 degrees. (I later remembered that Destin showed an angle in the video of 28.85 - but I&#39;m too lazy to redo the math.) Crunching the numbers, I think a reflection off the table would come about .00046 seconds after the bullet, and a reflection off the floor would be at about .0054 seconds. That&#39;s measuring from the time the bullet crosses a point in it&#39;s path to the time the reflection crosses the same point. <br><br>It would be really cool if Destin could look back at the original video and see how far apart the various shock waves are to see if my very rough figures are anywhere close.", "comment_date": "2018-11-03T07:15:18Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "TOMOHISA", "comment_text": "The space between mach.0.8 and 1.2 is called the trans sonic stage.

Depending on your serious friend&#39;s rifle it probably has a rifle twist rate of anywhere from 1:7 to 1:8 so every 7 or 8 inches that bullet will do a full rotation. Bullets on the outside, especially if they have been fired (they will have rifling imprinted on the side of the bullet at the very least), are far from smooth. Here is where it becomes pure conjecture, would that rate of spinning cause a small sonic disruption. In theory if that bullet was traveling at the rate of 1000 feet per second the pullet would make a complete rotation every .04 seconds for a total 1714 (rounded down) rotations per second or 102,840 rotations per minute. If we use the  n \u2022 2\u03c0r formula where n = the RPM we should be able to get the velocity 102,840(2 X 3.14 X .154) = 99,458.6 feet per minute which is 1657.6 feet per second which is above the speed of sound.

Boat tails fly more cleanly through the air with less wake turbulence than flat tails. This gives them additional range. The.  .30-03  cartridge was developed for the m1903 springfield rifle. The cartridge had a lot of faults - Round nose, flat tail, and 220 grain weight. The high pressure powder behind the heavy bullet created chamber throat erosion. So they went back and redesigned it using features the Europeans had adopted. They put a spire nose on it, reduced its weight, and gave it a boattail. This new .30 cartridge was adopted in 1906 and became known as the .30-06. It became a premier cartridge in the US. That boattail and nearly 3000 fps velocity made it shoot flatter than other rounds of the period. The WWII ammo for the M1 garand was a derivative of the .30-06. Same dimensions but with a 150 grn. flat base bullet and less powder to lower operating pressure in the garand. It was called M2 ball ammo. But stocks of real .30-06 were still being made for the marine corps and for use by snipers using the m1903 springfield. The boattail and and heavier bullet could make a bullet  reach out and touch the enemy. There&#39;s stories of regular GIs using standard .30-06 in their garands for better accuracy. The round of choice was the armor piercing variety.

All this is to reduce the speedup of air parallel to the direction of flight.<br>When the air then reaches the tip of the wing, we then place the winglets, or the tips of the wings, to reduce the turbulence that the air pushed outwards creates. This causes a vortex, or the swirl of air around the tips of wings, reducing drag.<br><br>Really cool physics, very simplified in my explanations and even more advanced, but fun, when you get to supersonic flight.

We created a 4 sided clear sided box with plastic wrap on the two open sides and then rigged a hair dryer to heat up the air inside the box. We positioned the camera such that we could get imaging of the bullet before, during, and after it was in the box. As you know, heating or cooling air changes it&#39;s index of refraction. We were able to heat the air in the box enough that a supersonic bullet became subsonic when it entered the box and supersonic again when it exited!

The expansion fans form first, supersonic expansion.

Here is my hypothesis:<br><br>We are looking at a 2D projection of a 3D cone created by spheres of pressure waves. In an ideal fluid where it&#39;s equally dense in all locations, you would not see those spheres as easily. However, in air that is constantly moving and fluctuating, as air in an open shop would, we get slight differences in pressure. As the bullet flies through those areas of slightly differing pressure, those differences affect the spheres of pressure that are generated, and they become slightly offset from each other in energy/size/other aspects. This offset becomes clearly visible inside of the cone that the spheres make up. You are seeing the side profile of the spheres that are offset from their neighboring spheres in some way.<br><br>Also note, because you placed the razor horizontally, you emphasized vertical differences in photon refraction as opposed to horizontal differences. If you place the razor vertically, you might be able to emphasize the vertical profile of the circles even more because it would be emphasizing horizontal differences in refraction.

Those funky lines not only appear just as they did on the sub sonic bullet, they are appearing INSIDE an already existing sonic boom and more than that, they are at a sharper angle than the already existing sonic boom. Those are tiny sonic booms within the sonic boom. Why is the angle sharper? My only guess is that the density of the air in the sonic boom (between the front and back ends) actually makes the speed of sound SLOWER inside the sonic boom, hence the angle being sharper on the inside, and bending to match the regular angle as it passes through the density differential to reach the back end of the sonic boom.", "comment_date": "2018-11-01T10:54:06Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "offroadtek00", "comment_text": "I&#39;d like to see the air flow of different type/style muzzle brakes as seen from above.", "comment_date": "2018-11-01T10:52:06Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Crimson Halo", "comment_text": "Transonic shock is really cool looking.

This is because the differences in what the flow does between subsonic and supersonic means whenever you&#39;re in that transitioning range you get huge losses, with both extra drag and less efficient propulsion (transonic pinch). As an example of these flow differences is what happens in a diverging nozzle- in subsonic flow, diverging nozzles decelerate the flow. The opposite happens in supersonic flow, where a diverging nozzle section actually accelerates the flow, the complete opposite of subsonic.<br><br>Quite a few supersonic aircraft engines use this in whats called a &#39;con-di nozzle&#39; (converging-diverging).

Therefore the angle of the shockwave depends on the speed and the angle of deviation needed. The only way it creates a Mach cone is when the angle is very small, then the angle tends to the one of a Mach cone. I&#39;m saying this because I don&#39;t think those speed calculations are too valid, they can approach the real speed but not the most legit thing.

I didn&#39;t see much disruption coming off of that subsonic bullet, but on the other hand I&#39;ve always thought that anything that reaches supersonic speeds in our atmosphere creates a loud sonic boom/crack, whether a plane, bullet, or bullwhip.", "comment_date": "2018-11-01T08:36:18Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Francesco Pham", "comment_text": "Hi Destin, Is that mirror the same of a reflective telescope and how much does it cost?", "comment_date": "2018-11-01T08:35:32Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "One for All", "comment_text": "Thank you for keeping me motivated in my engineering classes by showing me cool ways I can apply the stuff I learn.", "comment_date": "2018-11-01T08:35:20Z", "likes_count": 2}, {"comment_by": "Weskerend", "comment_text": "Amazing!", "comment_date": "2018-11-01T08:35:05Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "nick4819", "comment_text": "I&#39;ve never gone to school for any type of science and that&#39;s my biggest regret.

I&#39;m raising them for the State Fair contest that I&#39;ve won for the last 5 years running.&quot;<br>      My friend agreed and went back out to join his friends. He saw the donkey (which was limping badly) and the two prize cows. My friend was a bit of a prankster and though he would play one on his hunting buddies.<br>     My friend was very mild mannered and willful destruction of the properties of others so when he rejoined his friends he said, &quot;They guy said &quot;Go around&quot; and slammed the door in my face.&quot; He drew a bead on the donkey and fired, achieving a perfect heart shot, the animal dropped without knowing what hit him.<br>      He expected to see his friends looking at him with their mouths gaping at his out of character behavior when he would explain the deal he made.<br>     What he saw, to his horror was his friends aiming at the cows. Before he could stop them they fired. Unfortunately, their marksmanship was equal to his. The cows died as quickly as the donkey had.<br>     Before commenting, this story is a rather old joke.

I was shooting at the range with my dad. I was spotting for him and could see the bullet travel downrange with a shockwave following close behind. I think the reason I could see it happen was the weather was perfect for allowing me to see it with the naked eye. I&#39;m curious if any meteorologist could go into detail on how the shockwave was possible to see. I don&#39;t remember much other than it was raining that day, a light drizzle I believe, and maybe had high humidity since it took place in Florida and most rain happen because of high humidity.

So you should be able to get the distance to whichever surface the waves bounced off of.
