But Destin - you are not really finished with this topic. Because at a certain point - at a certain distance from the bow, the arrow (should) stop deflecting - it should straighten up and fly straight. How soon it does that, depends on quite some factors: Type of bow (longbow, recurve with plunger, compound bow), how clean the release is (fingers / mechanical release) and most important maybe how well the arrow fits to the bow. I.e. if the static and dynamic spine matches the bow perfectly or not. This can be tested with for example paper tuning tests, closer or farther away from the bow. If I recall longbow and recurve archers don&#39;t use paper tuning, they use bareshaft tuning, while compound archers uses paper tuning. I actually don&#39;t know if it is because from longbow / recurve, the arrow will flex all the way to the target - or if it stop flexing at a long distance that you normally not do paper tuning tests. Maybe the paper tuning test to some extend could show that. But maybe slow motion filming is better, because at a random distance, you could be lucky that the arrow goes straight through the paper, because at that point it is in a straight point of the flex. So that could require quite a lot of tests. With compound bow / leverbow, the goal is to have the arrow stop flexing at the shortest distance from the bow as possible. For example because, in 3D archery, you might need to shoot at a target, that is very close to you (and it can actually be difficult to hit a very close target in a finger diameter spot, if your setup is not well tuned etc.).", "comment_date": "2022-04-11T09:22:28Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Clay P", "comment_text": "This is one of the coolest topics I have ever seen tackled on this channel.", "comment_date": "2022-04-06T21:22:22Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Josh Moff", "comment_text": "The mass of the arrow head also has a big influence.

There will still be significantly more wobble in the arrow than a modern compound bow, but the notch helps compared to a traditional English warbow, which had no notch and therefore would push the arrow to the side more. The wobble of his arrow is present, but not much more than one arrow width. Also, I assume, perhaps incorrectly, that he shoots from a known distance so that he can always hit at the nodal point, similar to knife throwing. All that said, even if the wobble didn&#39;t matter in his shots whatsoever (but it does to some degree), his accuracy, precision, and timing are unreal. I.e. on the first two, his accuracy is how close to center he consistently hits and his precision is how small a group he can consistently hit. Most modern pistol, or even rifle, shooters cannot hit a moving target the size of an aspirin at any distance, and plinksters usually spend much more time aiming their shot that he does.", "comment_date": "2021-01-15T03:09:07Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Le Retard", "comment_text": "Wtf who tf shoots an arrow with the bow inclined to the right instead of keeping it erect", "comment_date": "2021-01-14T12:18:53Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Chrisi234", "comment_text": "i cant handle these slomo sounds since i saw the video that showed exactly how fake they are.

I was wondering if you could possibly do some videos on how a fly drifts in relation to the fishing line or what fly fisherman call tippit. The goal is to not have a fly be pulled by the tippit. I enjoy a  style of fly fishing where you use flies with a tungsten bead to sink. And very thin tippit to cut through the water. It is generally called &quot;European nymphing&quot; The goal is to have the flies go the same speed as the water in whichever water columns they are in, generally faster at the top and middle of a stream or river and slower on the bottom and edges because or friction.  If you are interested I can explain in greater detail. Hope to hear from you. Feel free to look at my Instagram to see examples of some of the flies. If you have questions please ask. Take care.

There are few questions 1- on arrow  which side wobble starts  assuming that  long cylinder keep is side  on flight 2-  distance between  arrows release point and  target -  as  how many times the  wobble  will be needed in that distance   and what  will be the side of the wobble  on hitting the  target ....  So  the  shooter has to  at  least  go 1 arrow length step back  or forth  if he can guess  the  distance  with his eye ...    I am afraid  it is far too complicated  and not realistic - do they have some kind of  distance measuring gadget constantly  ???  Red dot  etc... I am sorry  hard to believe especially  for   archers who lived  centuries ago .... So many parameters to  consider almost impossible in longer distances. Today they have the same problems with 12.7 snipers nor 2 snipers  doing the exact calculations could  hit  same  target  at the same time  even   all others hard ware was same ....  Not many will know but  in the 70&#39;s   Epeeists  in West Germany  started   shaking  the  rather flexible blade created a kind of wobble   from the handle  so that the tip would arch  with the force on the steel  and land on the target ...  The first inventors  won many championships  worldwide  since there was no defense  and caught on by others  ever since ..... But there were so many buts   distance from the tip  to the target area   and blade flexibility  length  as  well as  speed of the  attacking fencer  has to all match considering opponent was stationery .... If the opponent  retrieved  fast  it was  a lot difficult  calculation  and hit was landed on the guard  meaning a  a failure. Obviously  what we call calculation  was  done by  guess work and visual experience ... Yet  it was not  a sure  hit  and riposte &amp;  counter riposte was  almost always  expected  at similar  levels. These kind of   varying distance  backwards and forwards  speed and  hardware  related targeting  is  a bit combination of   calculation  experience and luck  combined  so many variables  are in  a very short time span  should  be correctly matched .

Your brain will learn after multiple attempts what to do and where to aim even if you don&#39;t fully understand what is happening to the arrow.  Sort of like axe throwing or shooting hoops.  Axe throwers know that the distance to target is the most important thing and they have to throw at a distance that will have the blade around at target.  Basketball players spend most of their time practicing the 3 point line and free throws.  But do you actually have to understand the physics?  I don&#39;t know.  I think your brain programs itself through repetition.  Making sure the arrow you are shooting has the same characteristics as the arrows you trained with probably improves accuracy because it removes a variable.  But the brain having fired a thousand shots and having evaluated the results is probably more important.  I&#39;ve shot some arrows before, and never really thought about the physics of the particular arrow, but you never hit the bullseye by aiming straight at it.  Wind, distance, if you naturally shoot high or left, it all factors in.  Same even with guns over a long distance.  If your windage and elevation is set well for target shooting at 50 feet, it probably won&#39;t get that deer at 1000 feet.  So you can set it all up for 1000 feet, but you still have to correct for windage.", "comment_date": "2020-10-14T07:02:22Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Harly Glass", "comment_text": "Single use plastic..............", "comment_date": "2020-10-13T23:28:53Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "SAMUEL LOMGKUMER", "comment_text": "That cross bow dart got me.<br>Ok but now have you watched Lars Anderson??

But I&#39;ve read that the wobble frequency is somewhere in the realm of 90 Hz. At an arrow speed of 180fps that would be an oscillation every two feet. To be certain of hitting a tiny target you would have to judge the distance within perhaps 3-4 inches and then apply some difficult math to know how far left or right to adjust. It only seems possible to pull off a trick shot like that if you&#39;ve pre-determined the exact distance to ensure the tip would be centered on contact so you can aim directly at the target. Even with all that it&#39;s a remarkable feat of skill, but it seems a bit far-fetched to suggest that the archer would ever actually make a manual adjustment for arrow wobble based on distance.", "comment_date": "2020-04-24T19:28:42Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Andreas Hoppe", "comment_text": "This is great quality youtube content!

Right?<br><br>Which makes me think a bit more &quot;out loud&quot; about it: there are some techniques to stabilize fast travelling object&#39;s flight, such as a spin (think of a rifle; they have grooves or a comparable structure which adds a spin to the bullet and stabilizes it by doing so).

Something like Imperial Russia cowboys, but with bows, sabres and guns. And my granddad, who is 100% Kazak, taught me how to use a bow and how to shoot. The thing is, mounted archery and archery in the fields are all about morale damage, about how often death is coming from the sky, and how to shoot while you don&#39;t have time for aim.<br><br>You take a bow in left hand, arrow in right, place arrow on the right side of a bow. You won&#39;t have aim at all, but you don&#39;t need it! You won&#39;t have time for it either way. But you are not doing that awkward arrow-over-bow-and-back movement and can shoot at maximum speed.<br><br>So, your arrow on the side with a hand that&#39;s holding it. How you shoot? First, your bow must be a little rotated counterclockwise. So your thumb and bow would make v-shape. It is not nesessary, but you need to get used to it. You aim with your hand... body... instincts! Before drawing. Then you shoot. In one movement you draw and release it. Every micro-second after full draw would be a tension that would affect your accuracy. Yeah, maybe you won&#39;t have 100% on the first shot, but while others would make 1 you will finish with 3-5 of them. And total damage would be enourmous. (Even with 33% accuracy, one would hit the mark.)<br><br>Kazaks were all about fast ambushes with seconds of fighting and immideate retreat. Something that later would be called &quot;partizan&#39;s tactic.

The arrow loop is a very narrow &quot;window&quot; for archers in the castle to shoot out of while being almost 100.00% safe from return fire. The architecture that went into constructing them ensured that the archer would fire at a precise distance so that the wobble of the arrow would still fit through the arrow loop without the arrow hitting the sides of the wall as it exited. This extra distance also ensured that even if an arrow got through the arrow loop from the outside, it would be much more likely to miss the archer inside than hit them. <br><br>While they didn&#39;t allow for a great line of sight for attacking intruders from many angles, arrow loops would be built around much of the castle and occupied by two or three archers each. This allowed for arrow after arrow to be shot at intruders very quickly in places where intruders had to cross to enter the castle, such as the portcullis (castle gate). The tops of the walls and towers would be lined with crenulations for the archers on top to take cover while firing. While they didn&#39;t have as much cover, they could shoot at targets in zones where the archers occupying the arrow loops could not reach, or supplement their fire.<br><br>These walls also protruded out slightly at the top, and had holes in the bottom at the edges of the floor called machicolations that allowed defending archers to shoot straight down as well as outward. This meant that if an intruder &quot;hugged the wall&quot;, they could still be shot by defenders.", "comment_date": "2018-12-27T07:36:46Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "octarineflame", "comment_text": "NOT a longbow, it\u2019s an American flat hunting bow, a proper longbow is far harder to fire and requires actual skill as you aim BEFORE you pull the bow to full extent", "comment_date": "2018-12-26T11:54:35Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Mathew Toll", "comment_text": "This is a great vid - enjoyed it a lot!", "comment_date": "2018-12-26T04:24:47Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "FUNNY GAMING", "comment_text": "Nice vid", "comment_date": "2018-12-26T04:24:43Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "RENMJA", "comment_text": "Why am i watching this", "comment_date": "2018-12-25T13:45:06Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Dr. Sarabjeet Singh", "comment_text": "Nice advertising \ud83d\udc4c\ud83c\udffd", "comment_date": "2018-12-25T04:45:52Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "David Harrison", "comment_text": "English longbow every time . the true soul of archery .", "comment_date": "2018-12-24T20:04:20Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Richard Somers", "comment_text": "These videos are great.", "comment_date": "2018-12-24T16:37:54Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Abhijeet Singh", "comment_text": "The way he showed....&quot;so it snakes around..... &quot;<br>Awesome <br>And a like.

The arrow is pointed at the target. Seems like a minor difference, but it&#39;s an important distinction. With proper spine and arrow tip (weight) selection - as Byron  discusses - one can overcome the effects of arrow flex to achieve accuracy on target. On the other hand, if you don&#39;t point the arrow at the target, it&#39;s pretty much guaranteed that you won&#39;t hit it.<br>If the archer&#39;s paradox operates as you explained in the video, perhaps I can ask the obvious, illogical question: how wide can a bow&#39;s riser be before the arrow stops &quot;flexing around&quot; it? Put another way: per your depiction, the arrow will still make its way to the target no matter how wide the riser is.<br>The common misconception regarding the archer&#39;s paradox comes as a result of the inappropriate conflation of two unrelated concepts: arrow flex and archery aiming. Arrows do flex - some of this may be caused by interaction with the bow, but it is mainly due to the stresses imparted on the arrow system (nock, shaft, arrowhead) during the firing sequence. When aiming an archery shooting system (bow, string, arrow), one isn&#39;t actually aiming the bow toward the target, but rather is aiming the arrow toward the target.<br>Funny enough, you actually showed this via the use of the toy bow and crossbow at the beginning of the video. You aimed the suction cup dart directly at the camera and succeeded in hitting it. The bow just happened to be aimed directly at the target as well.<br>If you&#39;d like to test this - and I&#39;d love to see you do so - you will need center-shot bow. You might start with bow that has a modern olympic-style riser on which you can verify true center-shot. Tune the bow so that it achieves accuracy on target according to accepted standards of tuning and aiming. On a side note: If you use a peep sight, you&#39;ll immediately see that you&#39;re aiming to the target along the arrow, not the bow. When properly tuned, this setup will provide a bow-target line that is exactly parallel to the arrow-target line. Just like the toy bow you used earlier.<br>Next, build up the riser with ever-thicker shims between it and the arrow - this is to simulate the use of a non-center-shot bow (like a long bow). If you maintain the bow&#39;s position relative to the target you will find that -  while the bow-target line remains the same -  the arrow-target line has shifted. This will naturally result in a shift of the arrow&#39;s point of impact. You might use a couple laser aiming devices to illustrate this shift. Can you guess where the arrow will hit  now?<br><br>Arrows still flex when fired from a center-shot bow, so it remains important to select shafts with the right spine for the draw weight of the bow (again, as per Byron). Among other things, a properly-tuned center-shot bow simply reduces any effects the bow may have on the arrow during the firing cycle.", "comment_date": "2017-05-03T20:23:31Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "six likesgore", "comment_text": "alright.. but what about archers who use the same consecutive draw back and release with the same hand?  for example, they grab an arrow with their right, and raise it to line it with the bow on the <b>right</b> side, making the motion a continuous fluent one.  would it still be the same &quot;paradox&quot;, or?", "comment_date": "2017-05-03T20:23:24Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Simon and Georgie McCarthy", "comment_text": "Superb explanation", "comment_date": "2017-05-03T18:42:19Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Brett Ozero", "comment_text": "I knew a bit about this, but now a good explanation lets me know why I can do better with the longbow using carbon fiber shafts than with aluminium ones.

The aim for the bow isn&#39;t to line up the string with the bow with the center target.  The aim is to look down the arrow and have the arrow pointing at center target.<br><br>Your tree analogy is flawed because you overly exaggerate the deflection.  The actual deflection?  Very small and easily compensated for.<br><br>After all, if you look closely at the slow motion around <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O7zewtuUM_0&amp;t=3m20s\">3:20</a>, the arrow actually bends in the opposite direction than the described scenario regarding the tree and the arrow, despite the initial deflection, is pushed forward straight.  The deflection barely even changes (a few mm) as the string pushes it forward.<br><br>As for the Aspirin?  Part luck and part the fact that the tip of the arrow actually doesn&#39;t oscillate all that far from center.  I have, unfortunately, broke plenty of notches off the back of my arrows by hitting them with another arrow.  I once drove a second arrow into the back end of the previous causing it to split.  Not a perfect split though and not all that surprising.  The arrows were carbon fiber and so they are hollow like a straw.

Its a special skill, and its hard (don&#39;t think I&#39;m saying anyone could do it easily, it takes practice like anything), but not useful for anything other than tricks. He doesn&#39;t draw the bow very far. The poundage on the arrow is relatively weak when he shoots something so close to him, like an aspirin from a few feet away, the arrow doesn&#39;t actually wobble nearly so much as if he shot a target 50 yards away. So, its not as tricky as it appears. He may as well be tossing the arrow at the aspirin with his hand. The serious wobble on the arrow occurs when he does a full draw and loads up the poundage. Then of course, he shoots at much larger and farther targets. And, the farther away the target the less wobble in the arrow. It eventually straightens over time/distance.  So, hitting a farther target is still pretty easy because the wobble has subsided. If that wasn&#39;t the case, archers would suck much more on average and archery would be a horrible way to hunt or kill people in battle. I would be much more impressed with hitting an aspirin from full draw with a bow that had enough power to easily kill a deer or elk.

Part of the reason for the bend is the Law of Inertia. The arrow point has some weight to it which is usually heaviest part of the bow (per square inch). When an archer releases and arrow, the arrow point remains in place for a split second but the nock side of the arrow is moving because of the string. To conserve energy, the shaft of the arrow has to bend. Because of the elasticity of the arrow, the arrow shaft will bend one way and then bend back the other way because it wants to go back to its original straightness. As the arrow flies, the wobbling of the shaft reduces until it is straight or close to being straight. If the spine of a shaft is too weak and the arrow point is too heavy, its possible for the shaft to break. If the shaft is too stiff and the arrow point is too light, then the arrow won&#39;t bend back to its original straight shape fast enough and it will fly away in a direction that is away from the bow. There&#39;s a fine balance to find with respect to arrow point weight and shaft spine.

If he gets the shaft axis of the arrow to point within a few degrees of the target during impact, the quickness of the vibrations will sweep and hit everything in an arc in front.<br><br>I could be wrong, but this is a much more reasonable explanation than Bryon factoring in air drag of arrow, aspirin, timing the release so precisely it eliminates the possibility of one half cycle of vibration offset and doing it all in the span of a second. I know humans after practicing for decades get crazy good/amazing at what they do, but this is, in my understanding, outside human capability. I&#39;ll believe it if you can show me a video of Bryon holding his hand steady from any sort of twitching.<br><br>Still, what an amazing archer.

It cannot move to where it is not, because no time elapses for it to move there; it cannot move to where it is, because it is already there.

Since the wobbling nodes (where there is no wobbling) is so close to the tip and nock of every arrow, in reality, our archer does not need to worry about trying to time the wobble of his arrow with the distance and power of the shot. Looking at that high speed, it looks like the tip only wobbles about one centimeter up or down, and since he does not need to hit the aspirin exactly on the middle of the tip of the arrow, the wobble uncertainty is small enough that some part of the tip will always hit a target directly in line with the arrow no matter at what stage of the wobble the arrow is in. Notice that his aspirin shot was done with a flat arrow tip, so that even of the edge of the arrow hit the aspirin, it would still break it.
