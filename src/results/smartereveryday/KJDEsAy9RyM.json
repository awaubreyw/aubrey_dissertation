Hey I got a question. @ <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KJDEsAy9RyM&amp;t=6m55s\">6:55</a> I wondered if I&#39;m  the only one that noticed that as the water drop got close to the water on the dish. It began to egg and the bottom of the water droplet began to fall at a faster rate than the top of the water drop(i played it at .25 speed when i first noticed it)<br><br>I thought to myself hmmm. I thought things fell at a constant rate. Did the water begin to attract to each other? Or was the water just changing shape Before that and I just didn&#39;t notice? I would love to try this experiment to see the things that happen at predictable rates and just to see what all I could learn just from watching water fall.", "comment_date": "2022-06-21T03:28:43Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Tibor Futo", "comment_text": "Next time use BLUE paint in pissoir. :-D", "comment_date": "2022-06-10T09:12:47Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Cas", "comment_text": "I&#39;m probably wrong but have you tried measure for static in the water increasing with resonance, does static exist on water surface?", "comment_date": "2022-06-02T05:38:01Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Crazy Cat Lady", "comment_text": "I think maybe magnetism has something also to do with it.", "comment_date": "2022-05-13T02:32:24Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "GJ McKeown", "comment_text": "Do you think the reason why the cello works so well is that when you play it the strings are a standing wave?

One molecule between them is enough to keep the distance to big.  It takes some time to get rid of all the air between them and get the right distance between the compressed molecules to overcome the existing Hydrogen bound in the surfaces.  Because of the compression the Hydrogen bound is stronger at the surface than inside the water. So the droplets and surface must come real close to join droplet and water.<br>The speaker let the droplets dance over the surface.

Four of the six sides of the oxygen atom do not have attraction, thus they do not stick. Given enough time to adjust their orientation the water molecules will combine. Add the right wave energy and the water molecules will not combine with other water molecules, thus the water beads will not break and dance on top of the other water molecules.<br>Well, that is my theory away.

I am thinking they must bounce off each other a lot other a lot, otherwise they would all stick together and we would have massive bucket, garbage can, Smartcar, Economy car, small pickup, midsize truck, SUV, full-sized truck with dualies, dump truck,etc. sized drops of water hitting the earth and busting stuff up!

I understand everything that you were speaking about. And do you have a lot of good hypothesis. However. I think your mistaking. Not completely. But more that. I have studied this very subject for many many years. I studied it every single time I sat down and had a cup of coffee. When I discovered was the very mechanism which displays how out of nothing something becomes. What I mean here is that. I can make that ball of liquid jump up out of the liquid which it comes from and dance around on the surface. it doesn&#39;t do it because there&#39;s oxygen or air in between. It does it because of the vibration inside of the liquid. And the vibration inside of the droplet. Oh yes and I heard your statements about the size of the droplet. No I&#39;m sorry it was the doctor&#39;s statement. Where he said it depended on the size of the droplet. Yet. They say that all of the imperial measurements were derived directly from the droplet of water. Because it held a consistent measurement of 1 mm per droplet. It was this consistency which led to the measuring systems we have today. In my studies of this little water droplet. I discovered that the actions which I filmed and observed were due to the vibration in the liquid which was taking place inside the cup which I drug across the table. The display it made was quite impressive. It actually took on the perspective given to us in physics. It says that a waveform goes out throughout space at high rates of speed and they are continually making right angle turns which appear to be circular corkscrewing type actions. And when that one form of energy meets up with another form of energy like it. They continue on together and collect more as they do. Every time they make a right turn they disappear. What this is is a waveform that you cannot see. Unless you have tools to do so. As these waveforms travel about. It is said that they collect together until they become a tangible form. Something solid. Something we can see with form and shape and activity because it is inside of our tangible world. And what takes place here in the droplet floating upon the surface. Is that. when I would drag the cup of coffee across the table. A stream of droplets would shoot up one side of the cup in spray droplets of liquid up and out of the cup. When they would land in the cup. They would move around on the surface of the liquid with lightning speed. This is due to the lack of friction because they are riding upon waveforms. That means that just like two planets their energy force goes out to a certain point between the two planets this is where the place called The slipstream occurs. Zero Time zero energy zero gravity. And when you watch this droplet stay on the surface of the liquid as long as the vibration occurs and even after the liquid stops moving. You will see and come to know that what you are watching is the very activity of creation itself. This is where life comes from nothing and becomes something. It&#39;s pretty straightforward and holds true to physics. I have never had help with my studies. But for sure this is the very way that you can see how things develop from nothing into something. As I observed this activity. I always did it in awe. Because I believe it displays where life itself is and can be found. I could talk about this for a lot longer until you more that I&#39;ve seen and understand. But. I&#39;ve said enough here for the moment. Hope everybody enjoys. Once again I liked your video.

Water has a charge and when in bulk the molecules of water at the surface are arranged in such a way that the surface of the water would have a negative charge. Like a thin negatively charged liner. When a perfectly spherical droplet is made the surface of that droplet is perfectly arranged with a negatively charged surface. This leaves me to think that when the droplet makes contact with the water surface it is simply two negatively charged objects repelling each other. They do not merge until the molecules rearrange themselves in such a way that the positively charged hydrogen atoms are now making contact with the negatively charged oxygen atoms. Now when you introduced the speaker/frequencies my thought is that the way frequencies travel through air and water is done in such a way that the molecules follow the beat essentially. This is seen when you change the music types. The water behaved differently. So the thought is that when a perfect spherical droplet makes contact with the surface of water experiencing the frequencies the frequency is now traveling through the water surface and droplet and is prohibiting the molecules from rearranging as they would normally thus prolonging the walking water droplet. As for the space station droplets that break off this would be because the frequency the molecules are trying to follow, keep up with are rather violent with sharp shifts. so the droplets break off until they can remerge with the water bulk.

As soon as the surface charge between the water pool and the drop reach equilibrium the drop coalesces in the pool.

I first noticed such walking water droplets about 3 years ago in my coffee, but didn&#39;t manage to find any explanation in google. But if it&#39;s really just about softening the collision by hitting a wave at the right moment, that would mean that you could create a droplet exactly above a totally calm water surface so that the collisional kinetic energy is almost zero and you would see the droplet staying there on the surface without moving! And that would be even more awesome! But I would rather suggest, that there is another factor - it&#39;s about having an uniform thin air layer covering a big part of the surface (interface) between the droplet and the water surface, so that surface tension exerts big enough force on the droplet. That means the water surface needs to form an indentation upon contact with the droplet so probably a calm water surface won&#39;t work. <br><br><br><br>Anyway, this reminds me of an other &quot;glitch&quot; that I noticed few years ago - at the right lightning conditions you can see a double reflection of your teeth in the mirror, probably because both the metallic surface behind the glass, as well the glass surface itself reflect.", "comment_date": "2020-03-24T19:55:06Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "M.E.", "comment_text": "They&#39;ve patched it", "comment_date": "2020-03-24T18:15:29Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Ron Star", "comment_text": "Once again, you have rocked my world.

Take a gander into the firefighting world and how we have evolved from smooth bore nozzles which create almost a laminar flow to the use of fog/combination nozzles that create little droplets of water. Before we had to directly attack the seat of the fire to extinguish it. Now we are taught to open the door to the room that&#39;s on fire, spray a small burst of water in any direction and close the door. Those water droplets quickly turn to steam and that steams cools and extinguishes the fire or knocks it down pretty hard. The other cool thing with fog nozzles is when we turn the nozzle head to the left, it creates this big wide cone that shield us from heat and flames, all because of those little water droplets that effectively insulate from the heat. Also, a final note to intrigue you.

It&#39;s like two magnets with the same polarity next to each other, that vigorously repel, but also eventually try to flip and switch alignment of poles to attraction. So all around inside of the droplet, the molecule&#39;s magnetic polarity do two things, one, they keep the droplet tightly together, and two, all around the surface of the sphere of the droplet, the molecule&#39;s magnetic charges repel, and support the weight of the droplet, until some of the magnetic charges realign,  possibly and eventually by getting influenced by randomly spinning polarity in the molecules in the larger body of water, until some of the magnetic fields switch to attraction, and then the droplet gets absorbed into the larger body of water. That is my opinion on it, It&#39;s probably even more complicated and interesting than that on an atomic level. Later in this video with the blob of water in outer space, you can see the effects of the water&#39;s self attraction, and it&#39;s resistance to breaking apart unless affected by just the right frequency to have a vibration compromise the magnetic fields for a brief moment and let a certain amount of water molecules to break away from the larger body. The outside surfaces of each body of water have similarly charged polarity so as to repel each other&#39;s surfaces and not allow absorbtion, while they bounce around.

It has to do with charge. In a water droplet, its formed an equilibrium between the hydrogen bonds within its limited space and therefore resists being absorbed into the larger body of water for that brief moment in time. Upon coming into contact with the body of water, some of the water atoms turn about and make a connection. That is why there is an explosive connection occurring where a ripple is being sent through the receiving body of water. Further, the reason why the water droplets are not fusing with the larger body of water when vibration is added is due to spiraling. It is causing the water atoms at the center of that drop to spin and therefore increase internal draw thereby overpowering the pull of the water that is being vibrated. It gets more complicated than that, but that&#39;s the gist. Water cannot stop from spiraling.

Back in the 1970s, I read in one of the Foxfire books that moonshiners would gauge the completion of the distillation process by watching for a &quot;bead&quot; dropped from the condenser into the collection vessel to form on the liquid surface.  Alcohol has lower surface tension than water, so its drops don&#39;t hold together strongly, and I am thinking they are not strong enough to withstand collision with a liquid surface, so they spread out and coalesce more rapidly than water and probably faster than the eye can discern.  When distillation of a mash is complete, its temperature rises and water starts to boil off and be condensed.  The higher surface tension water droplets obviously can withstand impact with the liquid surface, and thus a bead with long enough &quot;hang time&quot; to be observed after dropping from the condenser.

Probably you&#39;ll explain it later. Anyway it&#39;s actually also on the basic theory of what&#39;s happening during a landing. Sometimes airplanes just don&#39;t want to land and that&#39;s because of the fact that on the surface of the airways the air it&#39;s warmer, due to continues friction between the tire and the surface (continues landings and takeoffs) and we all know that hot air goes up. That&#39;s enough to create a layer of air that makes the landing harder. So is it actually hot air vs. normal air ? It&#39;s based on the same physics principle of the walking water mistery. If we combine the Archimedes&#39; principle with the states of matter, will we be able to see whats going on? I mean that Liquid will coalesce with other liquid, not before taking away the &quot;annoying&quot; air in between; also solid will coalesce (actually not, but we can approximate the friction between tire and surface, or a cubic rock with another cubic rock to a coalescence) not before taking away the air in between (of course it will be faster due to the weight). Will the water expantion on a solid surface be faster then the coalescence (water with water)?

So if this form is the magnetic optimum for it selve falls to a nother surface powert by magnetic force from earth feeld (By the  way thats also a problematic understanding why some think falls down. It is not because of magnetism, it has to do with a potential compensation) first the force will bring it inside of the surface of the water has to breake down the force which is inside of the drop. We can understand it like a little feeld, that let the water become and organise them selfe to a drop. This feeld first has to breake down, that takes time to bring down the energetic level of the drop to a point, the feeld of the surface of the Drop and the surface of the watermirrow are the same, than it will flote in to geter.", "comment_date": "2020-02-16T02:47:15Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Gumbi Is A Meatball", "comment_text": "I like to contemplate Infinity.

If so, does cello impact fluid performance in the human brain?  Why ask?  Because high-IQ individuals tend to prefer classical music.  I know that it stimulates me when I study.

Different temperatures between droplet and main body effectively results in 2 different density bodies approaching each other.  Therefore the molecules are misaligned and so they do not mix.  The temperature difference is balanced out very quickly on impact and the main body transfers its temperature (heating or cooling) to the water droplet.  Once temperatures are equal, molecules align and the droplet is &#39;absorbed&#39; into the main body.  I think that this is a more accurate description of what is happening rather than the &#39;air gap&#39; theory.

I am thinking why a droplet forms in the first place - clearly the surface tension acts like a kind of bag or balloon.  Just like a balloon the surface tension requires (not very much) force to break it.  There are certain conditions where the surface tension of the droplet is not broken by impact with the surface tension of the water it is falling onto... and so it bounces. Remove the surface tension and I predict the phenomenon will not be evident.  I propose introducing TEPOL (anywhere) then repeat the experiment!

H2O molecules are in the form of a triangle. There is a very strong bond between the hydrogen and oxygen pair.  Surface tension is due to these triangular molecules aligning in one direction at the surface due to their charges.  Like charges repel, opposites attract.  The molecules align in such a way that not only do the water molecules on the surface plane attract one another, but that outwardly they repel along the plane.  A water droplet is a group of molecules that because of this same principle, project this repelling force outwardly as sphere.   Water does mix with water but when water molecules are all aligned the surface and the drop both have the same charge.  It&#39;s not a large charge, but it is there nonetheless.  As the drop settles and the air molecules are pushed out, eventually this is overcome by proximity of the molecules, not unlike the flipping of a magnet in proximity to another magnet with the same pole.  Once those molecules on the surface begin spinning around, there is a cascade and the the drop merges.  Under the right conditions and with pure enough water, one might be able to suspend a drop indefinitely.<br><br>I would think if you could zoom in enough with the high speed camera, you might be able to detect the deformation of the water surface as the drop approaches, before it actually makes contract.

If the conditions are right the water will bounce up and separate into a drops.  Never thought about the air pressure (hmmmm?) or temp.  The drops and the water have surface tension with air in between.  The surface tension has to be overcome on the water and the drop and will make the drop for a moment skate across the surface and slow down coalescence. The air gap in rough water is maintained longer.  Timing is key with conditions.  2. Oil in the water also cases it but it is not normal.

This can be tested by dropping the droplets from different heights at different liquid levels on different types of hard surfaces. As the height increases you will expect more bounces, same with shallow liquid level, same with liquid on hard surface (try this on an angled smooth granite surface with shallow liquid flowing down). For the liquid molecules on the surface of contact line there is a net force keeping each in their camp, as the air gap diminishes the difference in these net forces also start to diminish and the molecules in the boundary between the 2 surfaces now begin to accelerate their mixing, this will happen so fast as to create a somewhat shock-wave which is seen in the video.  All other properties of the liquids (temperature, viscosity etc) will also play an effect depending on how they play into these force differences.", "comment_date": "2019-05-12T15:44:12Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Steve H.", "comment_text": "I would have thought that it was water tension that kept the water droplets intact; that the droplet would stay intact until a force acted upon either it or the body of water it was resting on which was great enough to overcome the tensions (ie:  collision).

Resonances happen with sound waves as well as light waves and even gravitational waves. What I\u2019ve discovered along the way is that when any two waves interact, if the frequency of the waves are just right, they become almost \u201csymbiotic.\u201d Meaning, they don\u2019t necessarily increase in amplitude or frequency, but they create a repeating pattern that\u2019s that\u2019s more than just a single peak and valley long. It\u2019s greater than the sum of the two waves, so to speak. There seems to be something special about, what musicians call, \u201cthe perfect fifth.\u201d What this means is that when a note or chord with two waves per unit of time is played at the same time as a note or a chord with 3 waves in the same unit of time, the waves interact in a unique way which to the ear sounds much richer. This also repeats all the way up the piano in a predictable pattern so it doesn\u2019t matter if the two notes are high or low ones. All over the world we see intuitive examples of it in the Buddhist\u2019s chanting \u201cOhm...\u201d The more monks chanting, the greater the harmonic richness. It\u2019s in the certain bells which have the exact right curvature to produce this harmony. It shows up in many things. Why? And why, when you hear it, you feel this great sense of relaxation? I believe that somehow the vastly complex interaction of the vibrating bits that make up living things, miraculously produce this perfect fifth harmony as both a fundamental union of whatever this whole crazy natural world is, but it\u2019s also an emergent quality of the final product - life. When the energy loaded sound waves of Baroque music, interact with our own body\u2019s light waves, the set straight any small frequencies which aren\u2019t operating in unison and we \u201cfeel\u201d better.

The frequency of the waves are smaller than the diameter of the drop of water. Which makes it much less likely to find a large enough surface area to negate the air gap. And as you can see. That&#39;s exactly what happens. The drop dance is on the water. Until it gets to the edge where there are a lower average density of waves. Where the drop can find a large enough surface area so that the air gap is more easily disbanded and it promptly merges, mellds or &quot;coalesce&#39;s&quot; right in. <br><br><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KJDEsAy9RyM&amp;t=7m12s\">7:12</a> That is the calculation that you would use for a larger system. But it&#39;s actually the surface tension of the drop of water is higher then the impact of the air pressure caused by the impact of the layer of air on the body of water. Whether or not the body of water is vibrating at a frequency higher than the diameter of the drop of water. But it will be substantially less likely to immediately find a surface area large enough to negate the air lair if it is.<br><br><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KJDEsAy9RyM&amp;t=9m50s\">9:50</a> so the cello is a very rich sounding instrument. And this is for a reason. Because it actually covers a very large frequency even though it is technically a low frequency. Because it is at such a high amplitude. So it is actually breaking off drops of water in what would be a very high frequency wave. But because it is in this particular shape it creates a standing wave.

Most of the unique phenomenon observed in water are due to its polar nature.  I suspect that this behavior is no exception.  Mind you, this is my own hypothesis, so don&#39;t ask for references...  <br><br><br>If you think about it, the falling droplet and the water globule in orbit are both micelles, formed in free fall, which negates tidal forces caused by the acceleration due to gravity.  In the absence of gravitational influence, water molecules in the falling droplets, being polar and having an electrical dipole moment, align themselves to neighboring water molecules due to van der Waals forces, or hydrogen bonding, just like little magnets.  The positively charged hydrogen ions are attracted to the negatively charged oxygen ions in neighboring molecules, creating a cohesive force that tends to keep the droplet from drifting apart.  The same phenomenon causes molecules on the droplet surface to form a cohesive elastic &quot;skin&quot;  with a net inward pull because there are no water molecules to pull the surface molecules away from the droplet.  The force vector acting upon the surface is directly toward the center of the drop .  We call this skin &quot;surface tension&quot; and it takes a surprising amount of energy to break it.  We&#39;ve all seen a steel sewing needle float on water in beginning physical science class.<br><br><br>A funny thing about surface tension is that it too is polar as the bent water molecules tend to arrange themselves with their central oxygen atoms pointing outward and the positive hydrogen atoms inward.  Remember, each central oxygen atom in water has two pair of non bonding electrons just hanging out, repelling the valence electrons in the OH bonds and warping its water molecule into a 104.5 degree dogleg.  Granted, the net charge of the whole droplet is zero, but the outer surface carries a strong negative charge.  It&#39;s what makes lightning possible as these electrons can be stripped off through collisions with other water droplets.  <br><br><br>The water in the pool also forms a polar surface tension with an electrical dipole moment, just like the falling droplet.  Since like charges repel one another, the falling droplet is going to begin encountering upward repulsion between its negative surface charge and that of the surface tension of the water in the pool.  This upward force will increase exponentially as the gap narrows until it exactly cancels the downward force of gravity, at which point the drop will hover very close to the surface of the pool, without contacting it.  It&#39;s most likely a combination of induced charge migration and random molecular activity (Brownian motion) that causes the droplet to eventually contact and merge with the pool.  This hypothesis could be easily tested by conducting the droplet experiments under ozone producing ultraviolet light (Hg 184.95 nm), which tends to decrease the dipole moment of water molecules exposed to it, reducing the surface tension.  Just be sure to wear sunscreen and UV goggles.  The use of deionized water should slow down charge migration in the water and increase the hover time of the micelles if it is electrostatic repulsion and not trapped air levitating them.", "comment_date": "2019-05-09T01:31:37Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Prince Miro", "comment_text": "Chello though", "comment_date": "2019-05-09T01:20:52Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "HCEndgame", "comment_text": "Nice experiment, but the air gap explanation doesn&#39;t seem to explain it in my view.", "comment_date": "2019-05-09T01:13:28Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Artur Duchene", "comment_text": "When I see those cello drops dancing around it makes me think, &#39;some day somebody&#39;s going to figure out away to exploit this and make some awesome scientific invention that will revolutionize microfluidics or some other branch of science that will lead to amazing inventions we can&#39;t even begin to image.

If you slide the bottom of the cup across a smooth surface (preferably formica0, the cup will vibrate, and suddenly, little beads of coffee drink jump out of the surface of the liquid and dance around on the surface of the coffee in the cup. I was astounded by this because of the incredibly strong surface tension of water! How is it possible the vibration can be so powerful it breaks the beads out of the liquid under the surface tension force?  If you stop the action of sliding the cup, stopping the vibration, the surface goes almost completely calm and flat, but the bead of water stays on top for quite a long time, several seconds. I do not understand then, how the so-called &quot;air boundary&quot; between the bead and the surface can be responsible. <br><br><br>Here is what I think is happening: I think the nature of the surface tension of water somehow traps the bead surface tension when it is formed into the small spherical shape, making it more powerfully attracted to itself than to the flat water. Just as the surface tension of flat, calm water can trap a steel razor blade on top of the surface, the trapped or &quot;closed&quot; surface tension of the bead gets trapped on the top of the surface tension on the main body of liquid in the cup.  I think the nature of the &quot;closed&quot; surface tension of the bead, is actually repelled (or no longer attracted as much or enough)  by the flat surface tension - the beads tend to mostly return to the main body when they get near the side of the cup- where the surface tension of the flat surface is distorted by the surface of the cup, and possibly by electrostatic influence from the styrofoam.<br><br><br>I think this phenomenon is attributed more to the shape of the water surfaces than to the air trapped between the two surfaces or the added energy of the vibrations that made them. The attraction between water molecules is just too strong for the trapped air to be the primary causal effect. .. although it almost certainly is a contributing factor.<br><br><br>It would, of course, require someone far smarter than I am to work out the physics of the difference in closed sphere water surface tension vs. flat water surface tension. There seems to also be some sort of limit to the size of the spheres involved.

The needle helps to make consistent drop sizes (try a different sized needle) which helps generate the identical conditions needed to see this repeatedly. Other variable that need testing are the volume (and shape) of water below the drop which may impact the base water&#39;s internal resonant frequency. Also you made no mention of the pH or purity of the water (eg, distilled?) So many variables and none of them were tested. Even the purity of the air (and humidity) could have a huge impact on the survival rate since we are talking about microscopic distances between the drop and the water below it. In some of your clips of this phenomenon it seems that all the surviving drops have the same size (or multiples of the same size) so the internal resonant frequency idea &quot;holds water.&quot;", "comment_date": "2019-05-07T22:38:31Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "TheAbc45678", "comment_text": "You &quot;solved&quot; it?

Would a different recording of the same piece cause the water to react the same way? A solo cello is certainly a simpler and purer tone than rock music, but not more so than a sine wave. <br><br>Could it be the specific intervals themselves? I pulled out my score and tried to map it out as best I could and the water ball seems to vibrate the most with perfect 4th and 5ths. I would be interested in seeing a more detailed experiment with specific intervals, especially the 5th. I have always been fascinated by why western ears identified the 5th so early as such a pure consonance. I mean western music developed around the 5th. Could the reason why the 5th is so consonant have something to do with the actual sound waves and the way they interact with our eardrums? Do they move mediums (air/ water) in ways that are different than other intervals?

And it takes time for the droplet to change to the same frequency before it coalesces?", "comment_date": "2019-02-03T21:09:14Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Jonathan Tebo", "comment_text": "I wish they would&#39;ve added a little colour to the water around <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KJDEsAy9RyM&amp;t=6m20s\">6:20</a> so that it&#39;d be easier to see.", "comment_date": "2019-02-03T19:59:49Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Tory Cooper", "comment_text": "Does temperature change anything?", "comment_date": "2019-02-03T18:43:17Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Damitrix18", "comment_text": "I almost cried while watching this video.

Think of it like this: you have seen the stuff called Ublek? just a mixture of cornstarch and water, right? That stuff will solidify as pressure is applied to it, becomes a solid and yet it will mesh as soon as the &quot;stress&quot; being applied is relaxed.  I think that is similar. I may be wrong, but maybe this will be proved . . . to be true.  If anyone wants to challenge this theory, prove I&#39;m wrong.  I don&#39;t see air-gaps between the water(s)      Or . . . Let me put this way.  Can a liquid be pressurized to the point of suspense?  Example: as a vibration moves through the liquid it is synchronized. The droplet which has no or a different vibration cannot instantly meet the rhythm exactly.  Thus, momentarily it gets suspended in its most natural shape.

When will you people stop using a theory, that is unable to be proved which is gravity, as your argument for your hypothesis. THERE is no explanation that describes gravity, only examples of the effects what we call gravity. Every conclusion you came up with as the video progressed, I was answering... this is why. And it was because of my theory and explanation for what we call gravity. I am using laws and principles to describe my Theory.

This was an awesome video. Thank you. That one clip from the space station especially was awesome. I have a feeling it may be Bach&#39;s composition itself, rather than the tonal qualities of the cello, though. Perhaps it&#39;s both. I&#39;d be interested in seeing what would happen if another instrument played the same Prelude to the Cello Suite, as well as another different piece played by a cello through that same setup. I wonder what makes harmonies so pleasing to us. Do you think, since harmonic(harmonious?) frequencies share nodes, the dying preceding wave combines somehow with the following wave to tear at the surface tension with greater combined force? Like the way we swing to get higher on a swing set? Perhaps each harmonic interruption within the piece causes an acceleration within the wave form created in the water. I wonder if such a phenomenon exists, then if it would be from the jump from a higher frequency to lower frequency or lower to higher or both. Probably both.

These spheres sometimes last for two or three seconds. I found them fascinating and thought alot about them.<br>Victor Schauberger saw rocks of six pounds weight levitating in river rapids. The rocks came right up to the surface and bobbed about. This happened when the water was very cold and buoyant as a result.

The basic principle deals mostly with rotational velocity versus surface tension. Basically they are both water and thus &quot;should&quot; just become one again, however because of the movement of the water droplets through the air, a barrier is generated due to the difference between the molecular vibration of the gaseous air and the liquid water. There is at that point an even amount of pressure around the water droplet and now that it is isolated and falling, the movement can&#39;t spread beyond the boundaries of the water bubble in motion so that\u00a0downward velocity must be diverted continuously and thus\u00a0generating a rotational movement.\u00a0The bigger body of water is stagnant in comparison to the rotation of the smaller water droplet and so as the droplet spins it is moving too quickly to breach the surface of the bigger body of water. after a few milliseconds or seconds the bubble has slowed down due to a two part system, friction from the body of water and the water droplet being close and putting pressure on the small gaseous barrier between them as well as energy dissipating as the droplet rotates. After the droplet has slowed down, the surface tension of the droplet lets up and gravity begins to act more on the droplet and the movement of the droplet and the surface tension of the bigger body of water are significantly closer. The droplet gets too heavy to be supported by the small gaseous barrier and so it descends, penetrating the barrier and falling into the bigger body of water.

Running the bow across the strings creates vibration through friction, sustained friction. Other instruments, like wind, most percussion, and even a piano result sound from instantaneous pressure changes due to air or instant impact. Even a drum, though sustaining a partial friction based impact initially, the sound is produced due to the change in air pressure resonating off the head and walls of the drum.<br><br>With bow and string instruments, we have an entirely different source and cause of sound. Continuous Vibrational Friction of materials is necessary to create and sustain the sound, and the moment that ceases, the sound diminishes rapidly, depending of course on the tension of the string in question. Whereas in a wind instrument, the molecules themselves are being vibrated inside the instrument to generate sound. <br><br>Given that, the medium through which the molecules are vibrating emanates from an entirely separate kind of source of sound causing inducement. As such, I would wager a guess that a) if you were to further study this at a deeper level you may reach the answer as to why they cause this and nothing else causes this effect, but more importantly b) it suggests that molecules can vibrate in entirely different ways given the method in which they are induced to do so, causing different forms of sound. Much like a square, sine, or sawtooth wave, the idea could be that the molecules vibrate in just a certain way that is different than that of non-friction inducing sources.

I like to think of it in terms of pushing down a dead tree. You usually can&#39;t just push a tree over usually you need to push then wait then when the tree swings away from you again you push again. and as you are doing this you will realize that the energy in the swinging tree grows with every push you give eventually reaching the breaking point.

When you drop the liquid on the other body the charge bonds need to change orbital directions, that is, what I see in my mind is the vectors of the electrons must be altered to create a new bond. And, since this is pre-established in a droplet, there is some resistance to obtaining the new electron bonds. In other words, they like what they are bonding to, and are resisting altering this bond to accommodate a new relationship or cohesive attraction, Surface tension is a simple way to describe it. In my mind it has nothing to do with an air layer, but you say that lower ambient air pressures will hasten the integration of the droplet.

But now you have another question.<br><br>Suppose you had a dirty needle and as the water dripped out, they had a thin coat of oil around them.  The beading of the water would not be very surprising at all.  But instead of oil you have a skin of air.  Why?  Why is the air bounding to the surface of the water droplet (and probably to the surface of the still water as well).<br><br>The lower air pressure indicates that the air layer that bounds with the droplet is smaller and easier to penetrate.  &quot;indicates&quot; but doesn&#39;t &quot;prove&quot; it.  Perhaps the lower pressure relaxes the forces caused by surface tension for some reason.<br><br>For your theory to work, there must be some type of adhesive effect going on between the air and the water causing the air to want to coat around the water droplet.  The boundary stays with the water droplet as it bounces and skitters around.<br><br>The whole theory is based upon the air gap.  But we never see the air gap.  Seems to me the next step in validating this theory is two things.  More magnification and focusing on the air gap.  I&#39;m not sure high speed frames helps.  Perhaps have the lens half in and half out of the water or perhaps under the water looking up.  Perhaps using fiber optics to get closer to the point of contact.  It should be possible to &quot;see&quot; the air gap because of various things like the light diffracting through the various layers.<br><br>Obviously there are two boundaries between the two bodies of liquid but you seem rather confident that there is an intermediary air gap.  To me, that still has not been shown.  And, if / when it is shown, then the question is: why does the air bind so tightly to the water?<br><br>I would also question the purity of the water and utensils being used.

Most other tonal instruments produce sinusoidal waves.  Even though the body of the instrument will alter the saw-tooth wave to some degree adding harmonics, and the sound transmitted through the air to the recording microphone further alters and filters the waveform, it still remains a saw-tooth wave. This is analogous to an earth quake where kinetic energy is built up slowly over time and then suddenly released in an instant - either earth plates suddenly moving to new positions or the string of a cello snapping back to it&#39;s starting position. As a reproduced sound, I speculate that the sudden release of energy in each wave is high enough (especially in the lower frequencies) to break the surface tension of the wave peaks produced on the surface of the water. Because of the lack of gravity the energy that breaks the surface tension is also enough to send the drops bouncing around inside the bubble.", "comment_date": "2017-03-31T16:07:05Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Dave B", "comment_text": "I have observed the droplets skating across a wet surface, using motor oil.

The elasticity of the droplet is due to the strength of its surface tension.  The surface tension is a factor of the intermolecular bonds throughout the droplet.  <br><br>So when kinetic impact/rebound energy is introduced to the droplet, how do we know that kinetic energy is simply too weak of an internal force to break the intermolecular bonds of the droplet?<br><br>By lowering the air pressure, of course the internally induced (impact/rebound) kinetic energy could more easily &quot;burst through&quot; the droplet&#39;s surface tension and cause coalescence.  The molecules throughout the drop have lost the 14 pounds per square inch of external, atmospheric pressure that was constantly surrounding the droplet.  External pressure was being applied uniformly to its entire surface - now the pressure is gone - hence it would take less internal/rebound kinetic energy from within to overcome the strength of the intermolecular force&#39;s ability to adhere to one another.<br>.<br><br>Another thing to consider is the water droplet should have a greater elasticity to begin with than than the water surface it impacts.  I see this as being akin to a rubber ball impacting a large rubber block sitting on a table.  Vibration will be &quot;felt&quot; throughout the entire block, but its mass won&#39;t let it move as much as the smaller ball will move.  However, the result of impact for the ball&#39;s much smaller mass is translated into upward motion against gravity.<br><br>Both the rubber ball and rubber block have the same surface tension coefficient if they are the same rubber.  The surface tension coefficient is powerful enough so the rubber ball does not splat on impact Until an external force great enough would break its ability to retain shape).<br><br>Unlike rubber though, water is a liquid.   Thus the droplet can coalesce, whereas the rubber ball will simply rebound.  However, the physical laws are the same until they come up against the affects that will occur due to different states of matter. <br><br>So what migh be happening at the point where the doplet coalesces?<br><br>When the kinetic energy from multiple impacts is finally gone, the droplet rests upon the water surface.  For the first time the droplet&#39;s mass is not only putting a CONSTANT pressure on one small area of the surface, but now that same pressure induces the molecules on both surfaces to interact while in constant contact (I realize we are talking minute intervals of time - but we are also using minute particles of mass).  I have to wonder if there is not even a more enhanced affect from the water&#39;s surface &quot;side&quot; of the interaction due to it greater mass?", "comment_date": "2017-03-19T16:19:41Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Mohammed Fadil", "comment_text": "Awesome video!!", "comment_date": "2017-03-19T09:50:12Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Griffin Wagner", "comment_text": "I have never seen this happen, but interesting video.\u00a0 I&#39;ll keep my eye out", "comment_date": "2017-03-18T22:59:34Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Wei Chern Ooi", "comment_text": "Hi Destin!

My observation of this phenomenon predates yours. I first noticed it in the 1970s when I was doing lots of oil painting. I noticed that when I cleaned my brushes in turpentine I could easily create the little raised bubbles/balls by flicking the brush gently on the surface. They skitted around the surface of the jar of turps. I thought it was a surface tension effect caused by the mixing of different oils with the solvent and I also thought the bubbles/balls were spinning. I did notice that as they slowed in their horizontal movement they were more likely to coalesce with the turps. All this is consistent with your explanation involving air pressure. Later, I noticed the same phenomenon in hot drinks and on the surface of water. I still wonder if the balls were actually spinning - this might just have been an illusion - and it will be hard to tell if they are. The micro gravity experiment you showed was instructive as it demonstrates the role of surface tension in the creation of the balls and the reason why they are only ever very small (it&#39;s surface tension vs gravity). So thanks again for making the video and offering a clear explanation.", "comment_date": "2017-03-17T14:57:33Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "BrattiestClub00", "comment_text": "the nasa guy reminds me of George McFly", "comment_date": "2017-03-17T11:28:40Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Marc Jones", "comment_text": "Wow.

Also the droplets traveling through the air might possibly have differently charged particles/atoms in the molecules of the water droplets that are different than the water in the standing or static water.

I have been thinking about vibrations for many years and I think I know the answer to why Cello music did it when other electronically created vibrations did not. Imagine pushing a dead tree until it breaks. you need to constantly add force at specific times during the &quot;Vibration&quot; of the tree to increase the energy that causes it to finally break. but as you are adding energy you are NOT increasing frequency, only amplitude, Frequency actually stays the same or  decreases (I don&#39;t know). but the point is that Cello music would produce vibrations that are NOT constant, therefore slowly build energy in Amplitude which will build until the medium being vibrated fails or breaks or shoots off little drops of water ..... like a wine glass broken by sound waves. I believe the secret to breaking a wine glass with voice is not in holding a specific note, but slightly increasing or decreasing the sound at exactly the right RATE to be just lower than the vibration that has been set up in the glass at any given point in time.", "comment_date": "2016-12-31T14:53:21Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Paul C", "comment_text": "I\u00a0always assumed it was\u00a02 meniscus membranes opposing each other?

The water droplets hit the surface, causes a vibration on the droplet bubble and the surface causing it to fracture from the surface for a few split seconds which makes it look like it sits on the surface of the water. The air gap between the bubble and the surface don&#39;t merge until coalescence which can be solved through an ordinary differential equation. The water bubble has to reach a certain equilibrium(The Steady State Vector?) in order for the droplets to merge the with the surface because the strength of the vibrations decrease over time which causes coalescence. :D yeah I hope this makes sense...<br><br>Edit: just finished watching the video... i&#39;m not a physics major but it totally makes sense with the math equations. puts a few holes in what i said earlier.

The Speaker water is constanly forced with kinetic energy, and has a mutch higher mass than the drop. So when the drop hits the surface (and not breaks his surface tension instantly by hitting an up wave) the drop slides on the surface. And the molecules cant get to the same lavel of kinetic energy, because the higher mass speaker water is constant forced with kinetic energy, while only a fraction of the kinetic energy gets transfered to the drop, witch also has a lower mass and therefore acts different to the constant waves of (kinetic)sound(energy).

A long time ago I did an experiment with alcohol of the blue variant, called Spiritus in NL. !!!! WARNING BELLS !!!! FIRE &amp; EXPLOSION HAZARD !!!! I had noticed by accident this floating drop effect in alcohol and it was much more pronounced than in water. So I decided to design an experiment. This was in the controlled space of a physics lab BTW. I fitted a large glass bowl on a metal rod clamped to a firm base. This way the rim of the bowl was perfectly free to resonate vigorously when stroked with a violin bow. Various resonating frequencies could be obtained. Then I filled the bowl with alcohol to 15mm below the rim. When the rim was agitated with the bow, droplets spouted forcefully from the glass and landed on the alcohol surface, grouping where the surface was at rest. I had made a fluid Chladni plate. The droplets contrasted white against the blue background, very beautiful. The basic pattern was a four pointed star, next up was a six pointed star. Later on I devised a way of sustained resonance via a voice coil driven by a wave generator, which allowed for even more patterns.

The higher surface tension of the brackish pond water repels the softer, lower PH, rainwater, repelling the rainwater allot more.", "comment_date": "2016-12-05T21:58:18Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "SaltyRamenNoodles", "comment_text": "Tears rolled from my eyes when the cello video started.

Stringed instruments usually produce frequencies very similar in shape to sine waves when unfiltered. With instruments where you use a plectrum or pizzicato plucking such as classical guitar or banjo, these sine waves start and stop very suddenly and have a very acute attack. For cello, it still produces a sine wave sound, but since it is played with a bow, the attack is much less sharp. The slower introduction of the wave causes the water to slowly start to vibrate and bubble. His oscillator was playing harsh sine and square waves and causing the surface to vibrate right away. Thus, he didnt get the same effect. My best guess is that the slow attack of the wave accommodates the lack of coalescence, sort of pinching the droplet off as the waves become more severe. Of course, that&#39;s just an educated guess.

It doesn&#39;t coalesce until it has bounced several times - subsequent bounces much less hard than the first one.  <b>It seems there is something about bouncing hard that prevents coalescence!</b>  So then when you add the sound waves, all it does is make the drop continue to bounce hard instead of settle down!  That&#39;s why I am not 100% convinced of the &quot;catcher&#39;s mitt&quot; explanation - if that&#39;s the true explanation then why does the drop without the sound wave not coalesce immediately, when the surface is flat without a &quot;catcher&#39;s mitt&quot; wave beneath the drop?<br><br>I certainly believe that if the drop hits the wave peak, of course it is pierced and coalesces, so by process of elimination, landing in the wave trough is necessary for it to continue bouncing.  But I&#39;m unconvinced that the &quot;catcher&#39;s mitt&quot; explanation is the whole reason the bouncing drop continues to bounce.  I think it has more to do with the fact that the sound waves make it continue to hit the surface hard enough instead of settling, and hitting hard enough prevents coalescence for some reason (<b>perhaps if it goes fast enough it compresses the air underneath it to get a better air cushion</b>).", "comment_date": "2016-11-14T22:16:19Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "eric deherrera", "comment_text": "Are they antibubbles?", "comment_date": "2016-11-14T21:02:39Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Trace 23", "comment_text": "awesome as always", "comment_date": "2016-11-14T19:29:33Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Amber Langfield", "comment_text": "I was playing my bass speaker in my room and have some feathers hanging about 6 in above the speaker.

When this happens, the spherical surface tension can no longer maintain the droplet as a sphere and it coalesce with the water body.", "comment_date": "2016-11-13T17:48:25Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Professor DraffBot", "comment_text": "this is amazing!!! thank you, just thank you for that...", "comment_date": "2016-11-13T17:17:22Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "OniLordlius", "comment_text": "<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KJDEsAy9RyM&amp;t=2m55s\">2:55</a> WOOOOOOOOOOW", "comment_date": "2016-11-13T16:48:10Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "adam jshy", "comment_text": "i can do this with paperclips", "comment_date": "2016-11-13T16:28:04Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "gecko1501", "comment_text": "I want to see the video of the cello and water in space from beginning to end.

I never thought I would be this interested in science before (I always hated science in school, but that was mainly because I was scared of it...NOT NOW!).  I really wish I had gone to college for Engineering, since I have always been fascinated with knowing how things work, again...was scared of Engineering as well.  I did end up getting my graduate degree in Information Systems, but Engineering seems so much more interesting.

The air at the surface layer of the bubble may hold a charge, the air layer of the water container may hold the same charge thus for a brief time the nano layer of charged air particles are trapped.

Due to this \u2018repulsive force\u2019, a droplet hovers over the surface rather than making physical contact with it. This is most commonly seen when cooking: one sprinkles drops of water in a pan to gauge its temperature: if the pan&#39;s temperature is at or above the Leidenfrost point, the water skitters across the pan and takes longer to evaporate than in a pan below the temperature of the Leidenfrost point (but still above boiling temperature). The effect is also responsible for the ability of liquid nitrogen to skitter across floors.

The f-hole is the shape of the air holes on top of the violin (its cello cousin did get the same holes) that are supposed the &quot;let out&quot; all the frequencies from the inside of the instrument. Before this &quot;last generation&quot; violins (as they are today) these holes had many different shapes (circles, half circles, laces), but none of them did sound right. What made the f-hole the perfect (and final) shape was that it is the surface of a sphere. Peel an orange or a tangerine the right way and you get the f-hole shape (search &quot;peel tangerine f-hole&quot; on Youtube). And BECAUSE it&#39;s the surface of a sphere it can &quot;let out&quot; all the frequencies of the music&#39;s spectrum.

It seems to me that the phenomena is more related to differences in droplet and pool surface tensions, internal droplet pressures, surface pressures and deformations than it does any &quot;air layer&quot;. <br><br>If the internal pressure according to F = Gamma * L and F = P*A of a water droplet is less than the pressure of the pool surface of 1 ATM pushing up, and upon impact, the difference in surface tensions and deformation of the droplet and the surface absorb the impact energy to maintain said internal droplet pressure and tension of the pool&#39;s surface. Intuitively it seems to me that the surface tension of the droplet is greater than the tension of the surface causing the droplet to &quot;bounce&quot; all the while the droplet is able to deform much more than the pool&#39;s surface and absorbs said impact. On impact wouldn&#39;t the molecules be squeezed together i.e., density increased? Once the droplet bounces and comes to rest, the residence time might be the time for all forces on the water molecules of the droplet/pool interface to reach equilibrium and assume new molecular attractions, thus coalescing into the pool&#39;s surface. <br><br>If the &quot;air layer&quot; is true, then wouldn&#39;t it stand to reason that a much larger droplet, imply that an increase surface area would trap more air and be resident longer? Should it bounce less? More? What would happen if we increased the impact energy? Would it even bounce? I believe that the experiment where the residence time diminished with decreasing external pressure is affecting the droplet&#39;s and pool&#39;s internal pressures. It is clear that the droplet bounces quite readily and multiple times retaining its surface independent of the pool&#39;s surface before coming to rest without coalescing...something is keeping the droplet together, yes? I believe that the oscillating pool surface experiment is where the pool&#39;s perturbations constantly push against the droplet&#39;s surface moving it on a  constantly changing pool surface (as well as absorbing it in the troughs as stated in the video). I.e., the pool never lets it rest in one place long enough for the droplet to completely equilibrate molecularly and coalesce. How does the air layer theory work in this experiment?

And when there is a moving surface, in this 2nd case, the drop acomodates softly losing its kinetic energy and moves around. <br>Maybe ive not been able to understand it, and maybe im just showing my ignorance, but havent you forget the hidrogen bridges that attaches the water mollecules between them, creating the superficial tension of water? because this is the reason, not kinetics or air, because of some insects can &quot;walk&quot; on the water. As is also the reason because water doesnt wet as much as other liquids like alcohol or cetone, that have much less superficial tension and higher penetration and weting capicity.<br>The superficial tension is also the reason because water have the skill to climb walls when a house has a wet problem due to is capilarity effect: the litle holes on the wall are not easilly occupied by te water drops, because of their superficial tension that prevents them to go inside too small places, but when it does, the same reason that keeps the water mollecules together push all of them inside that hole. So you can see a wall where the wet climbs up as soon as the force that keeps those mollecules together is stronger than the gravity of earth. <br>Would not be those hidrogen bridges related to water&#39;s superficial tension related to this effect of water walking over water?<br>just asking.<br>sorry for my english, by the way, and by my grammar or vocabulary mistakes.", "comment_date": "2016-11-04T14:26:30Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "James Craver", "comment_text": "Is it the cello or is it the pitch?

Despite the water being the same substance or because we cannot remove temperature variation in the droplet it behaves as seen with a hot pan and water it allows the water to act as two independent substances due to them both repelling another from their surface tension as the water hits it either punches threw due to sheer weight or the weight of the water is small enough that it&#39;s able to impact and not break the surface tension of the water forming the air pocket for prolong periods of time more than one bounce. So it&#39;s all about the viscosity of water a level that varies on temperature and the droplets even at a small distance may change as a standing body of water will hold a different temperature then a smaller body quickly influenced by outside air temperature causing it to warm or cool faster this difference in temperature can create a change in the viscosity. In space it seems it&#39;s just droplets being pulled off the water that respond the same way they would as outlined above even without gravity the tension remains constant and could probably be tested by smacking someone with a water balloon in &quot;zero G (there is still gravity in space but it&#39;s affected by orbital space to counteract the downward force pulling it back to the earth)&quot; despite it having no gravity it still carries weight and so as a bullet can cause impact thus creating a force equal to it&#39;s mass though lessened it still exist.", "comment_date": "2016-11-04T07:57:56Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "The Champ", "comment_text": "Is it odd that veritasium and smarter every day uploaded videos on the same topic at around the same time?", "comment_date": "2016-11-04T07:56:52Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Michael Price", "comment_text": "I always thought they were air bubbles.", "comment_date": "2016-11-04T07:56:03Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "96Canny", "comment_text": "sorry Derek, Destin wins this round", "comment_date": "2016-11-04T07:54:23Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Jonatan Sj\u00f6berg", "comment_text": "I&#39;ve been amazed by surface tension ever since I was a kid so this was very satisfying to watch!", "comment_date": "2016-11-04T07:50:55Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "pantsuck11", "comment_text": "this was known for awhile, you video isn&#39;t good or original.", "comment_date": "2016-11-04T07:49:16Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "remex_shots", "comment_text": "Where can I find the cello footage from space", "comment_date": "2016-11-04T07:49:07Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "X Factor", "comment_text": "Great use of YouTube", "comment_date": "2016-11-04T07:48:27Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Adrian Garza Vlogs", "comment_text": "that was super cool.

This produces a wave very similar to a sawtooth wave, which kinda looks like NNNNN (best I can do with text). This type of wave is like lots of tiny impacts that are so close together their sound waves coalesce into a single continuous sound. I think this &#39;multiple-impact&#39; style wave helps to shake loose some of the peak resonances of the water.<br><br>Secondly, the cello can produce lower pitches than other stringed instruments, and lower frequencies can sympathetically resonate through solid objects better than higher frequencies. You&#39;ll notice on the space video the lowest notes on the cello are the ones that are able to shake loose droplets, whereas the higher notes do very little. This is simply the cello finding sympathetic resonance with the surface tension on the inner bubble.<br><br>What is interesting is the video appears to show that really low pitches resonate with the outer water surface, and slightly higher low pitches resonate with the inner water surface. I&#39;m guessing the size of the surface changes what pitches are able to form standing waves, which is similar to how sound works in air, where the distance between surfaces dictates what frequencies will &#39;stand&#39;.", "comment_date": "2016-11-04T03:47:50Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Jordan McSween", "comment_text": "FINALLY!!!

Im an inventor!<br>I saw more droplets comming inside the air bubble when the cello&#39;s frecuency was higher. Maybe you could find something more making the test sliding the strings from lower to higher frecuencies. I bet there&#39;s a specific frecuency that generates more droplets.<br>The cello, as any other string instrument, doesnt generates a single frecuency in a given tone. Instead, there are many harmonics (with less amplitude) at each side of the primary frec. In fact, those harmonics are the ones who differentiate the sound of a Stradivaririus vs a cheaper violin.<br>Well, too many words here. Ok, Im done. Wish you the best.

The way this differs from rock and stuff is that, yes guitar is a stringed instrument, but if it&#39;s electric, the pick ups and amp aren&#39;t necessarily going to pick up and project those self created harmonies.
