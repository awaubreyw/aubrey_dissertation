It&#39;s been strange being a dual YouTuber/Missile Tester, because obviously this side of my life feels very important and the main driver for many of my life decisions.  I&#39;m more than just a person who makes videos and puts them on YouTube, and I feel like I&#39;m kind of introducing you to the other side of me with this video.  I thought long and hard about putting this online after I was asked if I wanted to film my last mission.  I ultimately decided to post this video to let you know that Multi-Domain Operations are real.... and you&#39;re in the cyber domain.  I didn&#39;t understand the full extent of what the implications of this were until I dug into it more.  Over the course of the next several videos we&#39;re going to explore these cyber issues in a very real way.  I hope you&#39;ll explore this with me.", "comment_date": "2019-03-03T15:20:26Z", "likes_count": 11622}, {"comment_by": "Peter Boyle's", "comment_text": "How insightful 4 years later", "comment_date": "2022-09-03T23:20:19Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "santanag23", "comment_text": "As a prior service Marine and now a civ in the military, still serving the United States, I feel like this kind of stuff needs to be put out more.

Over several decades they have moved from a technologically backward nation to one with its own, independent space industry.

In conflicts, the side that has the moral right has certain advantages, and any side with attempting to battle while located in a moral wrong has certain disadvantages. It is even codified in the history and founding of our country (the U.S.A.), that God fights with us when we defend honor and freedom, but fails to support us if we attempt to exercise unrighteous dominion. I know many would disagree, but I feel it is clearly evident in history this power and use of a spiritual dominion has been evident. The American Revolution should not have been winnable. WWII&#39;s balance was changed by almost inexplainable issues where in hindsight we can see tipping points such as Hitler&#39;s failure to logically pursue winning strategies or the allies gaining almost miraculous advantage where odds were against it. In short - the spiritual domain could be defined as &quot;Right makes Might&quot;. It is why our volunteer forces are always better than an military of conscripts. This is why it is particularly dangerous for our country to be playing with the morality of our forces through social experiments.

The one on the Port side would have taken out DC Central which would have eliminated the repair effort in combat to save the ship. The torpedo hit was another one that like you said was the end of the ship and also would have taken a heavy toll on the crew. I was on the USS Anchorage LSD 36 which was the target ship as well before this exercise I think. I am still repairing ships and my son followed and is doing the same as well. The work we do we cannot really talk about but having my son working in the same area at least we can talk about it to each other.

The four star general you interviewed seems to have a better understanding of Plato and Machiavelli amongst other philosophers and authors. Before videos and pictures there were books and paintings. There were and still are a plethora of books available that help shape every individuals\u2019 realities. It\u2019s amazing that we think this advancement in technology is any different than it was hundreds of years ago even though it is. It isn\u2019t that much different from inventing a language to pass along information more easily and secretively the same way we pass along information through encrypted messages through the internet or even video and/or phone calls. A lot of what the four star general has stated is true and the fact that we can pass along information more easily whether it\u2019s through a satellite phone or through a video on YouTube poses a bigger problem; how do we, the receivers of this new information, process this new information and then express what we know and how we know it. This idea leads into philosophy of science which gets to be more complicated the more you read into it, but the point is that all objective truth is subjective to everyone and all subjective truth is objective to us all. A perfect example would of subjective truth is gravity and a perfect example of objective truth is Newton\u2019s theory of gravity. We have gravity which is objective and we do know there have been more than one theories of gravity making gravity a subjective truth. Newton\u2019s theory is subjective because of Einstein\u2019s theory, yet it is an objective truth because it is still widely used and accepted.

A gigantic military has been built with no experience of winning wars on it&#39;s own, and for some reason, no ability to learn from other nations with this experience, or from history.<br><br>Part of this seems to have stemmed from an evaporation of any kind of humility, that most definitely was possessed by the US prior to WW2, but after it entered late into the war and chose a route through which it could profiteer massively at the expense of it&#39;s allies, bankrupting them, and so leaving itself as the &quot;lottery winner of world powers&quot;... it was left in a position of global power, without the experience of building up the power gradually itself as others have done previously.<br>As with many lottery winners, the ability to hold on to this power evades it, yet the arrogance of it&#39;s current power dominates. Wars are attempted through brute force, without the understanding of not just how to win, but how to end up in a good position. Eventually the power wanes, with debts spiraling, yet more and more militarization to maintain what power it can.<br><br>The great war machine the US has created, designed to win an fictitious brute war battle just sits and watches as Russia and China manipulate it&#39;s own democratic system, playing the long game, which the US cannot afford to do, whilst also invading Crimea and the South Sea Islands... all with no reaction from America, other than too increase the size and power of it&#39;s massive and ironically-inexperienced military.<br><br>Destin and the 4 star general... what use are your mini-guns, missiles and torpedoes, when you are playing checkers yet the world is playing chess, and always has been.", "comment_date": "2020-10-10T11:47:46Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "hey", "comment_text": "SmarterEveryDay you can\u2019t fool us with your cyber warfare propaganda!", "comment_date": "2020-10-10T10:08:42Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Indian Ministry of Illuminati", "comment_text": "I wish to become a military engineer to help Indian military develop weapons using biotechnology when I grow up coz I&#39;m good at biology and physics.

I was very well trained, at no small expense to the US Army.   That was 50 years ago, and our understanding of our mission was similar to what Gen Brown was saying - because of my job in Vietnam, usually I was given a specific mission, and the information, tools, troops and time that I needed to do it, then told to go do it and rarely told how to do it, unless it involved very complex coordination.  We usually succeeded because of this freedom to operate.  This was why I enjoyed what I was doing - I (usually) had maximum autonomy with minimum command interference - even as a relatively junior commander, and we operated as a team.  I also had the advantage of having some of the best soldiers in the US Army under my command.  We had access to other forces - US and Allied air, sea and not so much cyber, but certainly electronics, and of course the human domain.  The Space domain came later.  We worked as a multidomain team, but it was only after the Vietnam War, and several mission failures which taught the US defense establishment the need for a more cohesive force structure, linked fully, that our military began to develop as Gen Brown described as the current force structure.   I did not make the Army my career, but the experience helped shape my life in my later profession.

First, he was able to con a good portion of American voters with his never ending tales of how good he was when in fact, he is a failed at most things loser. However, he was very convincing. He did that with massive media manipulation. That&#39;s a form of cyber warfare.<br><br>Second, he enlisted, or was enlisted by America&#39;s enemy (read; Russia) to mount a massive cyber dis-information campaign against his political opponent, Hilary Clinton. He enforced and amplified the campaign by a relentless barrage of outright lies about her and made 100% sure that it was all repeated endlessly by the media, especially Fox News. This was yet more cyber warfare. <br><br>He has continued to do this for almost four years with a relentless campaign to proclaim himself as the ONLY person capable of saving America and democracy, when in fact, he is the real threat to America and democracy. For example, he continuously stokes fires of racial and civil discord causing the resulting protest, sends in federal thugs to cause more violence and proclaims his self-imagined enemies as the real cause and yes, says that only he can stop it. More dis-information and cyber warfare follows, even coming from his press secretary and of course, from Fox News and many cyber outlets controlled by Russia. The discord isn&#39;t stopping because TRump can&#39;t afford for it top stop. If it did, more people would consider his appalling record of failures over the past three and a half years.<br><br>Cyber warfare has sent America into a death spiral and a good many Americans still don&#39;t see it. Practically everything TRump says is a lie and many Americans fall for it, every time. America was built on unity (the UNITED States of America) and TRump thrives by creating disunity, yet a good portion of Americans seem to love the disunity, thanks to cyber warfare and the dis-information it promotes.<br><br>Cyber warfare and dis-information has been profoundly effective at seriously harming America.

One cannot consider the idea of &quot;domains&quot; to be new. Military forces, no matter how old they are or what country they fight for, have ALWAYS fought in these domains. A perfect example of that was when one of the speakers referenced a US Civil War conflict on (presumably) the Mississippi River. What is new here is the realization that all branches of a country must be able to operate in all of these domains. Once upon a time, the Navy and the Army would not even speak with one another. The first step to ending the interservive hostility and jealousy was the creation of JSOC. It became mandatory that the Navy, Army and Air Force work together to solve problems that, at that time, one branch could not accomplish by itself. In me opinion, JSOC was a huge step forward. It was not just for use in the war on terror, but virtually ANY conflict that popped up.  As with most things, understanding the &quot;problem&quot;, whatever it may be, is paramount to dominating your opponent or, optimally, convincing your enemy that he cannot win. The Japanese Samurai  had a saying that is on point: &quot;Win now, fight later.&quot;<br><br>There might even be another domain that appears to be rolled into the human domain and that is the psychological domain. Amazing and almost unbelieveable things can be done to a fighting unit in PsyOps actions. I have to assume that this &quot;domain&quot; has been considered since these people are obviously smart folks and would not have not forgot about it.<br><br>The discussions with our soldiers, sailors, etc. in this video were particularly interesting in that they told me that inter-service rivalry has morphed from a fatal flaw into a true strategic and tactical advantage. <br><br>Great job.

Where are the greatest divisions in our society? Is it religion, politics, wealth, sport teams?  I don&#39;t think any of these get to the heart of the matter.  The biggest disunity that threatens us, in my opinion is selfishness and pride.  When we stop caring for each other, throw brotherly kindness out the window, and embrace apathy and enmity.  This will encourage differences of opinions and status to swell and fester and reach breaking points.  As a whole, I think our citizens still care, but I also think its diminishing.  This General talked about the human domain.  If our enemies can&#39;t get us from without, they will look to get us from within; look for any little weakness and amplify it.  That weakness just might be found in the human domain.   Likely, it is already in motion.

Don&#39;t get me wrong, that would leave a learning or puzzle solving aspect away from your personal goal.  I served in the Air Force for 20 years and experienced a great deal of warfare operations including teaching at an Air Mobility Warfare Center for a period of time.  I took away a lesson from my 20 years of service that made me realize the resources of all the aspects of warfare are critical.  You need manpower, gear, ships, tanks, aircraft, satellites, communications mediums (internet, coding, decryption...) as well as resupply for all those resources.   I think you have done a great job explaining how misinformation can lead to an advantage and we need to devise a spirit and goal of determining the best approach to counter this. By the way, we have a great deal of people in the &quot;professional media&quot; that should be completely unbiased and realize the impact of how tremendously they falsify information through their bias.

I found that through your online activity they can accurately interpret your &#39;psychological profile&#39; - to do with how you respond to content etc. I try to be as deceptive as possible - liking things I don&#39;t like, not liking things I do like... The thing is that this data can be very dangerous especially for people who through that vulnerability can be further manipulated for ulterior motives. Myself I see the internet as a resource like a library, however that brings into questions standards of publishing - it is my opinion that publicly available access should be filtered heavily and users should have to opt into VPNs to have unfettered access to the internet. That is a huge implication when considering internet content. We are all bound by service agreements with our ISPs and that agreement has legal implications that place responsibilities on providers in terms of ensuring &#39;quality&#39; of their service. When there are websites and applications that harvest user data and in turn use that data to influence and manipulate people you find results where specifically millions of people being targeted with slick advertising designed specifically to pull at your heart strings in order to manipulate your decisions. My conclusion that this was a serious breach of user trust. Computers themselves have an enormous amount of untapped potential and these sorts of techniques I&#39;m discussing are incredibly dubious in terms of what is legally and socially acceptable. Privacy is the central concern here and that matter concerns fundamentally the fact that all software if designed and implemented correctly should be tested against all conditions and scenarios. Hence vulnerabilities are not just poorly designed software components - they are intentionally placed into systems to allow for surveillance. In terms of the potential of computers - when people suggest that systems are impenetrable etc they are lying. When it comes to the potential of computers it is a matter of what tools you have at your disposal, any computer is capable of building tools to run such that there is no information nor software artifact that can not (in theory) be synthesized on a computer. As such it is all well and good to build products designed to spy on people / violating their privacy - I just hope they understand that information is superfluous in the sense that all other information exists in dormant potential states in memory and that is everything!

The U.S. Army and the CIA are almost constantly at war in dozens of countries all over the world (= killing people, most of them innocent), almost always without U.N. mandates, and without being attacked by any country at all.

GIven that the &#39;Like/dislike&#39; rationality is ambiguous at best; some like the video becaue it depicts weapons (especially an American perspective), or close - the might of the US military complex, or some might just like person making the video, some might like the notion of &#39;political grace&#39;, some might just be liking the models in the chaps room, or the hat on his head...  <br>.<br>At current count 3.6 thousand people (myself inclusive) dislike the video again for varying reasons.   In my case it perpetuates the notion of conflict and the paranoid need (again a mostly American trait...) to be ultimately prepared for conflict, to the point of extreme overkill, a sort of 21st century minuteman readiness, supported by the number of civilians armed to the teeth with weapons that, in most other (rational) nations has been outlawed.   With such an unbalanced ratio, serves to show that as a species, we are most certainly doomed.   Why do people find war so appealing?   Why do people feel turned-on by seeing these obscene toys of death?   Some almost positively masturbating over the sight of the Zumwalt destroyer, or a (phallic) nuclear submarine...  <br>.<br>The United States spends more of its citizens money on its military assets than any other country (or even combinations of countries).   To what end?   Global domination?   Certainly the four-star general believes that to be the case.   <br>.<br>The global military industrial complex is also the biggest consumer of sequestered carbon (fossil fuels) and thus the biggest driver of GHG emissions, within the anthropogenic sphere of influence.  With the US military, by far the biggest culprit.  <br>.<br>The Four-Star General is obviously not up to speed on global events - specifically the dynamics of climate chaos.   Sure he&#39;s probably read the reports by the US military researchers that admit that global warming is an issue to contend with, with regards to &#39;National Security&#39;...   But like most people, likely quite myopic with regard to the full rammifications of an extinction level event, that may well present itself in full-force in the very near-term future.  <br>.<br>So to the &#39;Cyber Domain&#39;  -  I guess this makes me a &#39;cyber-conscientious objector&#39; (?)  I am BTW, a 60 year old who has been actioning against nuclear weapons and war all my adult life, since I left the Royal Navy where I served as a nuclear submariner, so I&#39;m not without some serious experience or perspective on this subject.  <br>.<br>I think it is totally obscene to be involved in any capacity, in the sphere of weapons and warfare.   This species has been around for approximately 300 thousand years and for most of that time, has been involved in clobbering its neighbours in one form or another, first with hand axes, then spears, then pikes and swords, then gunpowder and muskets, then rifles, artilliary, 1st raters, Ironclads, Dreadnoughts, battleships, submarines, tanks, bi-planes, Flying Fortresses, atomic bombs, jet fighters, nuclear submarines, ICBMs, drones and now the personal computer...   And there seems no end to it.   <br>.<br>What have we learned?   That basically we are mostly, seriously nasty organisms, incapable of rational thinking and treating ourselves and all other species (fauna or flora) with any degree of respect.   That human <b>might is right</b> (?)  Utter hubris.    <br>.<br>I see the apex predator - Homo sapiens-&#39;sapiens&#39; as an aberration in the evolutionary algorithm.   And we are likely doomed for a variety of reasons, not least of which, the inabilty to see how futile our endeavours are.  For ultimately, the planet itself will, and is in the process of purging the most destructive species ever to have evolved.  <br>.<br>Go and rejoice in your toys of war...  But remember, there have been five mass extinction events (that we know of...) and we are currently onboard, as the driver, of the sixth extinction level event.   And don&#39;t think for one moment that human ingenuity, technological prowess or faith in some ficticious sky daddy will prevail.   The forces of nature are far more powerful than anyone cares to admit, or might even understand. <br>---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><b>Humans -  Either drunk on hubris, stoned on hopium, or in a coma of faith and mostly oblivious to oblivion</b>", "comment_date": "2019-10-07T08:36:54Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Ch N", "comment_text": "Rely less on satellite and bring it all down to earth a kind of virtual war theatre... they tried remote monitoring in WW2 where they used psychics to read the chaos outcomes not all that successful ... knowing an outcome by knowing the elements that are able to know the chaos outcome, maybe quantum computing.", "comment_date": "2019-10-07T03:08:35Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Kicking Against The Pricks", "comment_text": "Not bad for your first salvo on your new weapon!

This is a very obscure, niche subject to the average American that I think is important to understand. Having been a GS employee working on strategy and capability requirements at a 4-star command, I have been immersed in this subject, and I am familiar with the Army&#39;s development of Multi-Domain Battle as it&#39;s guiding operating concept.  The old binary construct of peacetime and war has recently been replace with what the general alluded to; a constant state of competition of varying intensity across all domains. And at the Dept. of Defense (DOD)/Joint Chiefs/SECDEF level, the term Competition Below Armed Conflict (CBAC) has been adopted to describe exactly kind the threats in the cyber domain such as information warfare that the general described so well. I am biased, but I think that with regard to this subject, the Joint Staff and the services are far ahead of the rest of the U.S. government in recognizing and analyzing the threat and its implications, and trying to develop solutions. But, DOD can only affect how military operations are carried out, and cannot affect the development of a coherent and coordinated U.S. government strategy (what is referred to as a Whole-Of-Government effort). That is what we are lacking, which is why I believe we are currently losing to our adversaries. Since we are not shooting at each other, it&#39;s easy to think we are not engaged in a conflict.

You put your hard work into this, likely had many very stressful moments balancing all of this with normal life, and sacrificed a lot to get where you are I&#39;m sure. It takes a lot of will power to open up about yourself while not wanting to disappoint your viewers.

You&#39;ve spent many of your years helping people learn about science and technology, it not inspire them to have future&#39;s in STEM.<br><br>As with most long good words, as do the not so good follow. I honestly unsubscribed to your channel, and frankly am glad it is only at under 8 million subscribers. I respect you, and as a person care for you, but I can not support the mentality behind this video nor the people (and their mentality) it promotes. It is truly sad that even the smartest people expand and further the efforts of only dark sides of human nature, let alone with those that exert it with the most force. And I understand your initial concern of posting this video and your final comments, because our country is very divided and continues to be (watch 2020 election, thousands are likely to hate each other, sadly). But (and I&#39;m sure you have in your lifetime) if you truly have seen the rest of the world, have gotten to know the people of the rest of the world (even outside our list of allies), and have seen the tactics America uses (has used for awhile), you&#39;ll also understand how America has been only more of a source for the bad in the rest of the world and in those people&#39;s lives. We&#39;re not the only ones, plenty more are, we&#39;re just the most &quot;superior&quot; source. You and I both come from rather rural, conservatively dominant backgrounds (though I&#39;m not admitting to being democratic or liberal), so I understand a little the points of views you were mostly around, it&#39;s understandable. I have military family myself. But for you and the rest of the users, I hope everyone understands the implications of the U.S. army getting more involved within cyberspace, as well as what you Dustin and the General is getting at. If taken too far, just like the NSA did/does, don&#39;t be surprised if unnoticed censorship or divisive filtering of content becomes much more of a thing to prevent &quot;division&quot; at home while other countries are divided by the same people. I understand and agree Dustin, that our country needs to be unified.

Go on a war campaign, and you can end up fighting other nations that have treaties with your target, and neutral countries may even place embargoes on your trade to make supporting your war more difficult.

There were framers who didn&#39;t even like each other but still they came up with the Constitution. OK, with that said I&#39;d like to submit that any person or group of people who would take away or change any of the rights we have under the Constitution as written by the founding fathers are someone to watch out for. I don&#39;t care how &quot;they&quot; would present their argument for protecting US. If it goes against any of the rights granted us, it&#39;s headed in the wrong direction.

You realize this weapon is what I would call a parallel weapon where by the delivery system is people just as explained in the body of the video.

I look at all the political strife going on in the US with Trump and media and the Democrats and just people who can&#39;t stand Trump and wonder if this multi domain warfare has been going on by Russia and China for some time.  The internet is a fairly new element to this multi domain warfare system and I believe the amount of division created by it is a measuring stick of success of deployment.  It seems to me that they (Russians,Chinese) are definitely relishing in how much turmoil and division there is with people who back the Trump presidency and those that don&#39;t.  Never have I seen such divisive people who are somehow turning towards what I would call socialism.  This video explains a lot with what has happened since the inception of the internet and even more now as to how it will effect our lives more than first recognized by me for sure and hopefully now you that watches this video and understands the implications of it.

I too have felt the divide of the us and them, however, I live and was born in Wales. We were massively deceived in 2016 [more so than any other country of the United Kingdom] in order to allow Brexit to happen and take place - which is counter intuitive to what my country actually gets from the EU. Wales is the net beneficiary [out of the UK] of EU funding, we are the only country in surplus of trade in the single market, where in part my country has not got full law making powers [one area - Media]. All Welsh media is owned by a single UK conglomerate [Trinity] which holds the monopoly on what is news and what isn&#39;t, meaning there is no precedent to actually report Welsh news, from Welsh perspectives - where we find ourselves hearing a repeat of national news in our regional news and a void of knowledge of whats going on in my country. Part of me screams that it has been Englands intent to keep the North from speaking with the South of Wales, and where I am for unity of people who want to work together - I am against those breaking us apart and tearing people down... which, my culture and language has undergone a millennia of genocide. So I thank you for this information as it just re-asserts my presumptions, but I ask you - how would you counter my predicament? Can you help my country?

Without known end posts, one may extend a courtesy to accommodate or listen to an opinion from an entity that is well beyond an acceptable endpoint. For example, a comparison of the ideas emanating from what was considered the &#39;far right&#39; in the 1960s and 1970s are very much different than the ideas of the &#39;far right&#39; in the 2000s and 2010s. [Note: I am using the &#39;far right&#39; due to the fact that I have first-hand knowledge and experience in both time periods and the differences in the ideas of the right are greater, thus easier to document, than the differences of the &#39;far left&#39; goals for these same two periods.] While the 1960s and 1970s endpoints are worthy of consideration at both ends of the spectrum, those of the 2000s and 2010s are not as they are not representative of the founding principles of our government; they are incompatible with it. This is where the deception comes in - the changes in the end posts of the far right are not reflective of true changes but are the result of propaganda, much of it external in origin, which has been adopted by a minority of vociferous internal entities. Thus the spectrum itself has been skewed and what was not acceptable or allowable in the earlier decades has been given an appearance, though false, of acceptability. (Example: the KKK tried to hold a rally in my hometown in 1970 and the group was told in no uncertain terms that it would not happen - that is in line with this country&#39;s principles. Today, I am not so sure the right choice would be made.) To grant these false end posts any validity is to have lost the argument before you knew you were having one. At some point, one has to stop and say &quot;No. That is not acceptable in this country.&quot; (To see this in action, watch the US Ambassador to The Netherlands in his first press conference - I think it was early 2018 - and it becomes increasingly evident what &#39;freedom of the press&#39; means and why, on an international scale, the US has slipped to #48 - just shy of being in the category of authoritarian governments - in the most recent rankings.). Before the extension of political grace, you must be aware of the pitfalls encountered in assuming that all positions, including the false ones, have equal validity and represent the strengths of this country. You do have to draw a line in the proverbial sand and defend it against all enemies.", "comment_date": "2019-04-27T17:55:43Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Ahmad", "comment_text": "Dustin Talk about Multi-Domain operation<br><br><br>Nuke: Am I joke to you...", "comment_date": "2019-04-27T17:19:35Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "marwar", "comment_text": "Also this whole talk about \u201cmulti-domain operations\u201d sounds way too fancy.

And I wonder if that is, at least in part, the planned result of operations being carried out in the cyber domain. I have had this thought rolling around in my head ever since Russians incited a protest in Texas using nothing but social media. <br><br>It is said that during WWII, Japanese admiral Isoroku Yamamoto said that &quot;to invade the United States would prove most difficult because behind every blade of grass is an American with a rifle.&quot; There has been much debate regarding the authenticity of that statement, but the implication made it easy to believe. America was strong during WWII. Not only because of its numbers and resources, but because the nation back home was proud, resilient, and unified. If an invasion were to have occurred on American soil, the military would not have been the only threat; the invaders would have had an armed and prideful population to deal with. So how do you weaken such a nation? <br><br>Create social discord.<br><br><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOTYgcdNrXE&amp;t=27m06s\">27:06</a> &quot;I believe the biggest threat right now is division. They&#39;re going to find the biggest division within our society, and they&#39;re going to try and amplify it.&quot;<br><br>Immigration, health reform, abortion, and most notably, gun control. All of these are hot button issues, and using the cyber domain to amplify tension between opposing groups is viable method for increasing division and unrest in our society. Take the previously mentioned protest in Texas as an example. It was found that Russian linked Facebook pages were responsible for coercing both sides of the conflict; pinning Muslims against Texans, and resulting in a public protest in Houston. As senator Richard Burr stated, &quot;From a computer in St. Petersburg, Russia, these operators can create and promote events anywhere in the United States in attempt to tear apart our society.&quot; Based on these events, it&#39;s not too farfetched to believe these types of cyber tactics are being performed on a daily basis for any given topic; a topic such as gun control. <br><br>Weakening a nation&#39;s unity is one thing, but disarming a nation is another thing altogether. And what&#39;s a better way of disarming a nation than making them disarm themselves? I believe any further discussion about this idea would very quickly have me accused of &quot;tinfoil hattery&quot;, so I will just leave it at that.<br>The internet is a very toxic place these days. It&#39;s almost impossible to find a single YouTube video or web forum that does not contain severely negative interactions. And the scary part is that, due to anonymity, the internet is a place where people are free to express their true emotions and ideas. These hurtful, and even hateful messages are coming from the core of their being. People are being habituated into the &quot;us vs them&quot; mentality; moving ever further away from the unification that it takes for a society to flourish. And it&#39;s not only America. The far reaching fingers of the internet is spreading this virus on a global scale. <br><br>Proactive, intentional unity, brought forth by patience and political grace sounds like an effective countermeasure to combat this troubling dynamic. I just hope it&#39;s not too late to be deployed.", "comment_date": "2019-03-21T18:23:31Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Klarus", "comment_text": "This is something you can pnly see in this channel.

Both versions of imposing your will are a mistake, either because it&#39;s easier for you, or because it fulfills imposing stance B.<br>(A good example is Trump. Is he evil, or stupid? Either way, he&#39;s acting against American/EVERYONES interests.)<br><br><br>Taking into account these four factors, you&#39;re left with a logical system that promotes a unified alliance between all nations.. also world peace.. That means we&#39;re playing the earth like an MMO, which happens to be my expertise.. The only correct answer is A, or to improve your own position. Avoid B like the plague, and don&#39;t be evil. Plan so far ahead, that you can&#39;t be considered stupid. <br><br><br>You should assume that your citizens are stupid, until proven evil. The unfortunate by-product of an automated society is &quot;Big Brother is always watching.&quot; This means that your civilians &quot;aren&#39;t to be trusted&quot; A.K.A, the government is scared of it&#39;s people. That&#39;s one of the things America was founded on. A nation of people who aren&#39;t afraid of their government, but run their government to ensure that it is scared of it&#39;s people.<br><br>Also, in game theory, you&#39;d easily be capable of designing a system that focuses on the bottlenecks to your civilization. These can be defined as limited by energy generation, and elemental chemical resources (Though, energy = mass squared.) All nations can generate power, and resources are plentiful in space. Any product can be synthetically produced or created through automation, if you have power and the resources required to fabricate it.

This was an excellent piece, and I think I want to make something with this new information involved. I have a particular disagreement with your ending suggestion that we actively unite through digital forums, though I do generally agree with it and seek to behave in uniting ways online. I mean this especially in the sense of &quot;not posting things that are only geared toward disrupting or frustrating people. However, you should explicitly inform people what unity means as opposed to disagreement, a nuance which you touched upon. In truth, when members of the same group disagree, they can be fissioning into two+ other groups, or they might be grappling with each other and wrestling with the problem at hand. One major trouble with the &quot;CYBER DOMAIN&quot; is how often these conversations are, as the general noted, held personally in a public forum. there is very little real privacy for a group to engage in united activities through major networks online. And even then, that privacy is as fleeting as the continued respect within the community. Where we can correct ourselves in interpersonal discourse by actually discussing real topics in real time, this is not the same online. Each of those aspects, topic, time, and personhood, are vulnerable to outside forces that do not hold the respect for member&#39;s continued political grace in discussion. I don&#39;t know a real solution to this problem, but I also only just came to respect it for what it is through seeing this footage.

The military serves, they are not meant to lead.  Soldiers are trained for conflict and to kill, not for peace and to coexist.  Their desire to control what the public thinks of their actions in order to prevent calls from representatives to change their practices is understandable, but fundamentally disgusting.

It seems as though entities that hate our way of living are subtlety trying to undermine the U.S via this medium. As a history enthusiast I can see it again, the power play used in Vietnam is being used against us once again. Our freedom of speech although essential to our system of living is a &quot;double edged&quot; sword that must be carefully handled, and thus we must be careful to not loose sight of the bigger picture. This is that we have to be strong to keep these freedoms from being take away by those who covet what we have, or those who just want to destroy us for the sake of it. As stated earlier these entities are using this relatively hidden domain to chip away at us from a new dimension which we are not aware off,. An example of this is pointing out the flaws that we (like any other country) have, and magnifying them to the point that we forget that we are all one people who are trying to give ourselves and our loved ones the best chance at a happy life.

BTW, I totally agree with your conclusion about the need for civility even to those one disagrees.<br><br>I think there is yet another domain, one that knits those five plus the human domain, and one that seems at the present largely lacking, not only as to being developed but even the awareness of the need to do so, and that is the ontological domain.<br><br>This domain is in part embraced by concepts such as the semantic web, artificial intelligence,  data mining and such. And some tools are emerging such as OWL which is a language to describe ontologies. But these it seems are just fledgling starts.<br><br>Now one might think of an ontology as going beyond knowledge and even information and  trying to model understanding. Thus when a computer program says creates a triangle it has operations it can perform on triangles but that software falls sort of really understanding just what a triangle is.<br><br>And just how one goes about approaching modeling understanding is a tall order. But larger than  address the hows to do that it might be worth describing the benefit of being able to do so. For the over all benefit is what systems engineers often call  managing complexity. For take a specification to build a system, be it a simple  device or something complex like an aircraft or aircraft carrier.<br><br>To do that there need be numerous requirements documents to describe what the system must do under what constraints and schuh. Then design documents, test document,  training manuals, and the like. But Even with all those the ontology model that links all these together tend to be in the heads of those  that write those documents and those who then s=read and carefully study them. <br><br>An ontology model could be the glue that links all these together into a coherent whole . In doing this it can serve not just as a really smart search engine but can maneg the flow of information and the  allocation of resources such that  information can be pushed to users and bandwidths and menory allocated and managed to facilitate  that flow of information. <br><br>It can also perform diagnostics, authentications,  and security to detect intruders or unauthorized  operations and the like. It can also help  perform configuration management.<br><br>Now there are stand alone tools that domany of these nd the ontology model should not try to reinvent those wheels but rather integrate those  &quot;stove pipes&quot; so that they can work together.<br><br>Finally,  an ontology model must be user friendly, easy to use, scalable, extensible, cloud friendly, robust, etc.  Ceruan tools like OWL have been developed that seem ot be a good step in the right direction but are not all that user friendly but have a really steep learning curve..<br><br>Now just such an ontology model might look like is a good question and this might be a good starting point to developing such an ontology model  by  devising  various approaches of how such a model might indeed look like. and researching to see what others may be doing along those same lines.<br><br> BTW,  for anyone that might have an interest, my YouTube channel shows number of attempts to do that and show conceptually what an ontology  model might look  like.", "comment_date": "2019-03-09T16:49:30Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "rob morgan", "comment_text": "Exactly divide and conquer is the primary way our enemies both foreign and domestic are attempting to soften us up for something unpleasant...  thanks for framing the problem well!", "comment_date": "2019-03-09T16:48:41Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "jim cricket", "comment_text": "Wonder who pays better adsense or uncle sam.", "comment_date": "2019-03-09T16:39:10Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Greg Simones", "comment_text": "Love and respect our military!

It&#39;s clear from the very beginning that this weighs heavily on him. That does not change the fact that the content is interesting and useful to have out there for discussion. This was also a rare and tremendous opportunity to share a deeper view of modern military process, equipment, and tactics,  separated (mostly) from the current political discourse, and I think Destin would have been a fool to pass it up. I suspect the General and others in his command structure wanted this message out there specifically to bypass the current discourse and convey a message they see as important. That in itself is... interesting to think about.<br><br>2) He was not truly surprised at the video being a &quot;weapon&quot;, he led the admiral into a question he had pre-loaded in his mental interview notes. He does this all the time in his videos with people he interviews and even specifically discussed it in regards to his interview with Obama. He uses this tone and tactic to connect with the interviewee and relax them. (He also overthinks everything so it would be silly to even consider he hadn&#39;t thought about this for days before hand) This also led the General to be more honest with us, the viewer, which is a positive, because we walk into the rest of his statements with our eyes wide open. <br><br>3) The general&#39;s message was very patriotic and America-centric, and if you&#39;ve ever known anyone who&#39;s gone through basic training, you know why. Destin&#39;s comment at the end, notably, was not. I&#39;m certain that was deliberate and that is very important to acknowledge. The cyber/human domains we are talking about here don&#39;t follow national boundaries any more than they follow traditional conventions of warfare. They are ideological weapons as much as they are state weapons, and the need for unity is a multi-cultural, world wide human need to effectively prepare for any attempt to divide and conquer. I applaud Destin for approaching it that way. <br><br>I don&#39;t imagine he&#39;ll read this but I&#39;ll say it anyways: Thank you Destin for taking this opportunity to share this information. I know it&#39;s controversial and many will disagree with it, but I think there&#39;s a lot of value in having this train of thought in the military out there for public awareness, and far beyond the speech on the surface. It&#39;s also really cool to see just how wild your job has been for the past 15 years and put that in perspective with what you do for the channel. I&#39;m sure it&#39;s been a special challenge to balance.

And Destin, this is actually an effective strategy in the non-cyber realm as well.  What you are advocating is EXACTLY the reason why the United Nations was established.  One planet.  Not separate nations continually attacking each other.  The UN was designed to prevent WW III.  And it has succeeded in doing that.  But far more, it was designed to prevent ALL WAR.  Or rather, if any nation were to step out of line, then all of the other nations come together in intentional unity and focus on that one problem.  Kuwait in 1990 is a classic example.<br><br>You&#39;ve dedicated your career to working for the US Army.  And your amazing YouTube channel covers things like human spaceflight.  JFK is FAMOUS for his challenge for us to reach the Moon.  But very few people know that his vision went FAR beyond that.  He had a plan to end the madness.  Even more significant than the moonshot, he proposed that we get rid of the US Army entirely.  Also get rid of the Air Force, Navy &amp; Marines.  In their place, there would be the UN Security Force.<br><br>THAT is proactive intentional unity  ...realized in the non-cyber realm.<br><br>This was what JFK proposed to the UN General Assembly, giving his speech to the entire world.

As a former AF ammo troop, who worked mainly in the conventional and line-d sections in a test group, we got to see many things that were brand new into the service. <br> <br>The entire concept of a fully domination of every domain in warfare is extremely important. Its why the F35 is so important, giving a commander a fully scope of the battlefield  with its interconnectivity. Having the ability of the multitude of AEW&amp;C systems all talking, will allow the critical decisions of using a CAS platform, be it fixed wing or rotary, mortar or artillery support would be critical. Even air launched weapons that are getting smaller and more precise to lower collateral damage, but still with the same lethality to neutralize the target. That would atleast cover the air and land domains, and I cannot really comment on sea as I was not working with many systems that involved sea based weaponry.<br><br>Then you go into the space and cyber domains, and alteast for space domain, I have absolutely no idea what could happen as it is such a new concept. The only thing I can think of in that area would be the satellite usage.  Having imagery, radio, which could be considered both in space and cyber, and I would say some sort of space based weaponry if that is even possible at this moment.<br><br>Going into the cyber domain, you can have much, much more propaganda now as the world is so much more interconnected. You can have deception, like you said, to either cause, or calm the general population, as well as the government and military of other nations. Then you can have systems that would trick enemy systems to present them with false data, or rerouting the weapon systems if they have been already deployed.  Like Gen. Brown said, the soldier today, unlike days past, has access to much more support from the entire US military, with many options on what they would need. Just by having this video, and showing the amount of effort we are putting into multiple systems, could be a deterrent, but at the same time, it could be a push for other nations to push for their own systems.<br><br>I really think that the faster the US can fully integrate all weapon systems, and I mean integrated as in like the &quot;future&quot; generation of the Ghost Recon series of shooters, plus another few steps over top of that. It is kind of sad that I am separated now, and cannot see what kind of advancements we can make now. Its amazing looking back, to know that back then, I really did not see it as an amazement in advancements for the systems that I had my hands on working with the test engineers. Yet now, looking back, there were some serious leaps and bounds in interconnectivity and the ability of the USAF to do damage to others, while reducing the chances of friendly casualties as well as collateral damage.", "comment_date": "2019-03-07T03:15:49Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "CanadianParamedic", "comment_text": "Great Video", "comment_date": "2019-03-07T03:12:00Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Elizabeth G.", "comment_text": "U-S-A!

They got their controlled asset elected to the highest office in 2016. The U.S. is at least partly a puppet state. Too bad Americans and their leadership have lacked the ethics, intelligence, and humanity to see through and deconstruct the issues that divide them. However, it&#39;s remained much too profitable financially, politically, and psycho-socially to keep creating, maintaining, and stoking these divisions. They practice divide and conquer/rule abroad and domestically and the product of all of them is that this practice is coming home to roost. <br><br>Destin, its helpful that you are discussing &quot;unity&quot; but I think you need to put some serious time into investigating just how profound that issue is even just in respect to the U.S. More importantly, put some earnest time and effort in looking at the disunity baked into the culture, world view, and psychology turning the gears in your own head and emotions. Many have come before you with far more voluminous and substantive discussion on the matter than you present here. None have been particularly successful. Unity isn&#39;t particularly profitable so institutions of political and financial power don&#39;t particularly like it much. What happened when poor white people joined black slaves to rebel against their shared oppression? Slavery was made a matter of &quot;race&quot; rather than just status and division was created where where was none. We still live with it being very much active today. What happened when Martin Luther King nurtured unity and oneness among poor/blue collar workers and broadly, openly oppressed and segregated black people? He was murdered and division was maintained. In fact, through this latter process, the Republican party went from being rational and humanistic to being much less rational, much more divisive, even to the point of switching roles with the then Democratic party. Now the Reps are konservative and the Dems are... much less so but still konservative (this is the U.S. we&#39;re talking about after all). <br><br>What does this all mean? Well the division starts deeply within you and me and the fabric of the culture and society we&#39;re a part of. That&#39;s in addition to the wealth &amp; political power brokers maintaining it for profits in power and wealth. Yet they would&#39;t be able to do that if their seeds of division didn&#39;t have fertile soil to grow in. Likewise, their efforts wouldn&#39;t succeed if we didn&#39;t cooperate in our ignorance and our personal psychological, social, and yes, political investments in the divided order they put forth. Another way to sum this up is that the U.S. is doomed by its own doing from the board room to the White house, to the suburbs, to the trailer parks. Why? Because a massively monumental and far reaching shift of perspective and behavior is needed among all who occupy those &quot;levels&quot; of society... All those levels and their occupants... Not just leadership. A sufficiently &quot;democratic&quot; country gets the government they deserve.<br><br>So Destin, good luck being effective in nurturing &quot;unity&quot; in a footnote to an interesting video without the earnest, deep investigation, seeing, and challenge required to actually speak from and to something much deeper and substantive.", "comment_date": "2019-03-06T08:33:27Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "nogman2", "comment_text": "&quot;Is this video a weapon?&quot; <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOTYgcdNrXE&amp;t=21m28s\">21:28</a><br>&quot;Absolutely&quot; <br>My cue to dislike and unsubscribe.", "comment_date": "2019-03-06T08:29:33Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Curtis Rogers", "comment_text": "This is absolutely one of the most significant videos you have posted.

It&#39;s not your fault. You partially realized it yourself - you&#39;re a pawn on a chess field, the interview is a weapon. You&#39;re a part of the military-industrial complex. It&#39;s certain that the military had redactionary power over your video.<br><br>That&#39;s not the point here, though. It&#39;s really interesting to see the way the General interacted with you. You were told some interesting facts, yes, but also subtly manipulated [or perhaps you were also told what to say about the interview]. The General reaffirmed the US intelligence position that Russia invaded Ukraine. He did this since most people today agree on it. But it also reminds us of the currently re-escalating cold war, reminds us of the fact Russia is or should be seen as an enemy of the US, leading more or less directly to Russian meddeling.<br>I feel like you went down this train of though and more or less overanalyzed it into blaming the current political hyperdivision on foreign influences. That&#39;s a least a fair bit of a stretch. It&#39;s likely true that some parts of it are partially caused by foreign influence, however it&#39;s largely because there are increasingly divergent identites and political opinions stemming from different environments people live in - I THINK.<br>Calling for unity won&#39;t fix that. It will benefit a certain part of the population, namely the one currently profiting the most. The General most likely is part of that group, you are also likely to be in it, Destin.<br><br>The video also serves as &quot;propaganda&quot; for people concerned over the US losing it&#39;s military hegemonial position. It reaffirms that the US due to it&#39;s philosophy and society will always be ahead. A lot of people would tend to disagree given the alleged Russian meddling in the 2016 election. That topic is conveniently avoided alltogether.<br><br>Also, consider the fact that there was a careful and multi-layered decision that led to choosing you for this video, like the fact that your audience is international and tech/science - interested. This video also serves as an recruitment advertisement for parts of the US military.<br><br>That are just some points of concern leading me to dislike this video.", "comment_date": "2019-03-05T22:25:56Z", "likes_count": 46}, {"comment_by": "Azrul Ashraf", "comment_text": "Very awesome, I will continue pursuing my dreams to become an engineer.

I&#39;m a university-trained futurist (MS, Studies of the Future, University of Houston - Clear Lake) and currently studying toward a PhD in Sociology, so I recognize that there isn&#39;t &quot;the future&quot;: there are a lot of alternative futures out in time, and we generally need to be more aware of the possibilities if we&#39;re to make good choices about the future.<br><br>In a way, General Brown touched on this, though in a limited fashion.  He acknowledged that there are many different routes to a goal.  What he didn&#39;t mention (although you hinted at it in a round-about way) was understanding social construction.  It&#39;s important to understand how you perceive the world: that&#39;s shaped in large part by the people around you and how you and they interact.  If you only interact with the same people, you never generate new ideas, because you all tend to think alike.  But it&#39;s even more important to realize how limited your perspective is: different social groups think differently, and being able to see your own blind spots while seeing into theirs gives you a tremendous advantage.  <br><br>But perhaps more important is the ability to see beyond and behind the obvious futures that many people tell us are inevitable.  Those futures are not inevitable: we have the power to change them if we are aware of alternative futures&#39; existence.  Singularly, we can&#39;t know much about the future: we tend to get sucked in by shiny technologies and how people propose to use them to solve problems.  But many of the most interesting futures are about social change, and particularly how changing our perspectives on social issues and structures changes everything else: politics, economics, technologies and how we use them, just to name a few.  Together, we can explore each others&#39; blind spots and illuminate the hidden assumptions that prevent us from seeing those alternative futures that we&#39;d rather have -- like effective diplomacy making armed conflict a less inviting solution for resolving competition.  <br><br>I went into the UHCL Studies of the Future program thinking that science and technology drive society.  I came out understanding that society drives science and technology.  That&#39;s why I&#39;m taking a PhD in Sociology -- to better understand how we choose technologies that become central to the futures we create.", "comment_date": "2019-03-05T05:11:25Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "josiah emrick", "comment_text": "can you explain the 25mm round that went haywire at <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOTYgcdNrXE&amp;t=1m49s\">1:49</a>??", "comment_date": "2019-03-05T05:11:20Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Tobias Campos", "comment_text": "Why make war?", "comment_date": "2019-03-05T05:10:40Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Eliana Griffith", "comment_text": "Destin this is overwhelming...", "comment_date": "2019-03-05T05:10:12Z", "likes_count": 3}, {"comment_by": "KumiKaze", "comment_text": "You&#39;re wrong about the other half of the battle.  25% is blue lasers, the other 25% is red lasers.", "comment_date": "2019-03-05T05:09:36Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "thedocmyren", "comment_text": "Proactive!

There were multiple units of 155mm Howitzers, 203mm Howitzers, MLRS(Multiple Launch Rocket System) and several other units. We planned on doing a Time-On-target. The plan was to have everyone fire at a target at a specific time. Being a 13e in a unit and speaking fluent German gave me plenty of opportunities of seeing things and doing things. At that time I drove our Lieutenant around speaking to Germans about setting our unit in towns and helping with any problems that came up. I was able to go to a forward observation area and witness the rounds coming in. It was the coolest thing to see. Not just seeing what we normally fired at, but to see what that many rounds can actually do to the enemy. On a scale from 1 to Awesome, you definitely get an Awesome for what you did.

America is one of the scariest countries on this earth to me, not because of its inherent evil, but because of its twisted ideology. I don&#39;t want to sound condescending or overly judgmental, but there has never been a nation more engaged in war, imperialism and human rights violations than the united states. From slavery over Mk ultra and the countless wars your country has waged abroad I simply cannot see what it is that could persuade such a bright individual as yourself to wholeheartedly support it in its cause.

You have so much to give and your country takes all of it to make itself better at what it undoubtedly does best: wage war. <br>I respect you and think that you are an incredible person.

I don&#39;t really feel like any of this is really new, at least not since... horses, telescopes?<br><br>I mean, some things really change things, but the core ideas are the same.<br>I mean, you go from an army that charges straight forward to one that shifts to the side and ambushes you, or from one that has to march on foot to one that can use horses and suddenly you can move far faster. Go to one that can sail around the country, or others, rather than ride through it and that can be very significant. But the basic idea is the same, out maneuver the enemy and appear where they do not expect you. guns are a step up because you don&#39;t have to be in sword range, automatic weapons are an even larger step up because you can throw out more lethal attacks quickly, and mortars, missiles and torpedoes are a step up from that being able to deal area and structural damage from long distances.<br><br><br>You go from climbing trees and hills and looking through a telescope to using a drone or satellite that can let you view things from miles away and that changes things, but the core idea is just getting more information.<br><br>You can go from stealing, destroying, or subverting food, communications, ammo, detection etc. via physical means to leaking false information to double agents to hacking radar systems etc. and the core concept is the same as always, limit and deceive your enemies.<br><br>You can go from paying merchants pre-war to talk about how many soldiers you have when traveling through an area to dropping pamphlets to twitter and the idea is the same. Speed of transmission and dispersion <i>have</i> changed significantly and that may change it&#39;s effectiveness but the concept and goal hasn&#39;t. Moralize your soldiers and demoralize theirs.<br><br>Even being able to tell a soldier what to do rather than how isn&#39;t new, that&#39;s what leaders have been telling generals since the dawn of time. The difference isn&#39;t in being able to tell someone what to do, it&#39;s <i>what</i> you can tell them to do. If a solider can go from having to scout out many paths from one place to another in person with the constant risk of being killed doing it to telling a group of others to do it to using accurate paper maps and information about enemy locations to real time (thermal) imaging in minutes and can activate weapons around the world with a few key presses, that changes what that soldier can reasonably be told to do.

I am also a fellow engineer (civil hydraulics, retired), in my 80th year. WRT this topic -- modern warfare -- US/NATO advanced military capability must be maintained because there are bad actors out there -- chief among them, Putin - who want to destabilize and then control other countries or portions of countries. The US responds to this threat through the ongoing massive development of military capability, believing that &quot;if our enemies can see that we are so far advanced in our war-making/winning capability, then we will ensure lasting peace&quot;. I would like to politely debate this view.<br>1. There has always been a belief that if weapons are so horribly destructive, and if war is demonstrated to be utterly mutually destructive/insane, then wars will stop occurring. EG, Nobel believed dynamite would end wars; WWI would be &#39;the war to end all wars&#39;; &#39;Mutual Assured Destruction&#39; will assure non-use of nuclear weapons; etc. This is a fallacy; large elements of the military &amp; the public will always foolishly choose war when overcome by incitement, rage, and blind nationalism/patriotism. Consider how close India/Pakistan came to nuclear war just las week; a military coup on either side might have triggered it, with the wild support of masses of people on both sides.<br>2. Although I fingered Putin as one of today&#39;s bad guys, the US has started more unjust wars/interventions than any other nation since the 1950s: Iran; Vietnam; Laos; Cambodia; Grenada; Cuba; Chile, El Salvador; Guatemala; Panama; &amp; Iraq as examples.<br>3. The US/NATO purposefully &#39;poked the &#39;Russian Bear&#39; by belittling them for losing the Cold War, by expanding NATO right up to the Russian border, and by deploying SDI capabilities into ex-Warsaw Pact countries just west of Russia. Putin warned of serious consequences, that Russia would not silently &#39;take it&#39;...  and now we&#39;re on the verge of (if not into) a new Cold War and a nuclear arms race, with a paranoid Russian leader and citizenry.<br>4. The Defence/Offence industry in the US is now vaster than even Eisenhower feared or ever imagined. To sustain itself, the military-industrial complex needs powerful, scary enemies and constant threats. How can the US ever get off the war-machine treadmill it now finds itself on?<br>5. Wars start through blunders; through deep misjudgements about &#39;the other side&#39;; when neither side will blink; sheer stupidities brought on by misguided nationalism/patriotism; utter paranoia; crazy mistakes (eg. mistaking a rising moon as a swarm of missiles); or because of the threat of intolerable loss of face.<br>6. There is no way to ensure that a limited engagement between major powers will not quickly switch to total war...  as soon as the &quot;Use &#39;em or lose &#39;em&quot; thinking kicks in.<br>7. General Robert Brown is an intelligent, and, I&#39;m sure, a decent person who, no doubt, prefers peace to war, and who, again no doubt, believes that peace comes through military strength. But history is littered with top generals and field marshals who were wrong in their strategies and beliefs.<br>8. Destin, you said that cyberwarfare can greatly weaken a country by creating deep divisions in its society, and hatreds between groups. You are right...  but the greatest damage to your country, to NATO, and to the West in general, is, sadly, being caused by your Commander in Chief.<br><br>This was a very informative video, done well, as usual.

I also think it&#39;s good to &#39;&#39;empower the people&#39;&#39; in the way that they can think for themselves with a thought in the back of the head saying &#39;&#39;there&#39;s must be another side of the story&#39;&#39;, &#39;&#39;all piece of information can both be true and not true, you need to search multiple sources of info to get it right&#39;&#39;, etc...<br>I&#39;m just so confused by the &#39;&#39;human domain&#39;&#39;, even more with the interaction of the cyber domain...<br>As I said, pure food for thought.

I&#39;m a 41 years old french computer science engineer; I have been programming almost since childhood, beginning with BASIC on a TI99/4A computer in the mid 80s, I was writing assembly code in my teens, so you can understand it&#39;s a real passion for me. When I managed to enter one of France&#39;s best engineer school, I already knew what my major would be. Yet, I had never thought about ethics in my field. I worked on AI research projects in the late 90s and early 2000s, but it was so clumsy at the time that it never occurred to me it could be a problem - I still don&#39;t think AI is a problem on its own, it&#39;s the humans designing and using it who are the problem, as a specialist in the field wrote, AI is opinions embedded in mathematics, very powerful mathematics, but the keyword is &quot;opinions&quot;.<br>One day, I was 30 at the time, I saw a science philosophy class from a reknown french physicist and philosopher, Etienne Klein, and he said two things that started me on the path I&#39;m still on today: first, engineer is the one intellectual profession that seem to be absent from the public debate (at least in France, maybe it&#39;s different in the US); second, engineers have the skills to design the most simple systems, but not simpler, in order to elegantly solve complex problems, and in this regard, they have a social role to fulfill, and must think deeply about the ethical problems the systems they are building may pose.<br>Starting from these premises, I came to totally rethink the systems I build, becoming a kind of computer freedom activist in my daily engineer pratice, building systems to empower users and not take freedom away from them, fighting surveillance, centralization, and opinionated AIs seen by most ignorant people in the field as demigods.<br>As informative most of your videos are, I have always been bothered by the weapon related ones. I told myself it probably came from cultural differences, weapons are very restricted in France, and obviously it&#39;s quite different in the US.<br>I&#39;m not saying that what you do is objectively unethical, there&#39;s not such thing as objective ethics. I think I understand why you do this kind of job, and the ethics behind it. But my biggest concerns in today&#39;s world being peak oil, climate change, surveillance capitalism, internet centralization at the hands of transnationals and the promethean craziness of transhumanism, seeing people as smart and capable as you and your comrades wasting huge resources, time, money, to analyze how a missile destroys a ship saddens me. Do you really, deeply think this is the best use you could ever have done of your abilities? Don&#39;t you think there are more important problems to solve than make the US an invicible, almost godly if you listen to the general, war machine?

Now think about all of the essential services that can be disrupted by cyber means, and the damage to society if these services were disrupted for extended periods of time.  The internet itself which would take with it anything that relies on internet connectivity (such as banking and communications), electrical power distribution, banking, fuel distribution, shipping services including essentials like groceries, water processing plants, nuclear power plants, air traffic control, hospitals, GPS (think of all the back end services that depend on GPS for time/synchronization alone, not to mention positioning), cell phone communications, etc..  Many of these these things have already happened proving the vulnerabilities; hospitals crippled by wannacry attacks, the Mirai botnet attack in 2016 that disrupted American DNS and took the entire country of Liberia offline temporarily, air traffic control failure in 2014 due to equipment failure (fire) that took weeks to recover from, the panic caused a few years ago when an error caused a few GPS satellites to broadcast signals just a few microseconds off, the list goes on..

Destin, the problem isn&#39;t civility in the political space. It kind of fundamentally misses the point, and General Brown clearly knew that when you bought his propaganda, hook, line and sinker. If I had to pick the clear issue in modern military and political thinking, it&#39;s that they&#39;re too narrowly focused on what a weapon looks and acts like, and what a national security threat looks and acts like. General Brown even alludes to this in some of his comments, but I can only assume he deliberately avoids discussing it... or at least allowing it in the video. <br><br>The problem with your conclusion is that it assumes that the the current status quo isn&#39;t causing direct and tangible harm to the world populace, which I would contend is causing the lack of &quot;voluntary unity.&quot; You can see it in America, with how the marriage of corporations and politicians has left our infrastructure to rot. Elevated Lead levels throughout the heartland, public schools being defunded to the point where teachers have to work at Walmart to keep a roof over their heads, and automation steadily eating away at jobs that don&#39;t require skilled tradespeople and/or college degrees- these things are eating away at the Human resources that an operationally coordinated military desperately needs to function properly, and regional government&#39;s lack of response to these challenges does little to convince those who do manage to get out of the trap that the US is a country worthy of serving. You can see it in the Middle East, where the Syrian conflict began over a desired natural gas pipeline, and then grew because of a famine and a lack of clean drinking water caused (at least in part) by Climate Change. Saudia Arabia&#39;s disastrous campaign in Yemen, Israel&#39;s hypernationalism, Russia&#39;s cyberwarfare, and China&#39;s desperate attempts to take direct control of the South China Sea are just examples of how behind the US is in terms of what conflicts are going to look like in the future. <br><br>Threats are going to come in the form of complex, networked problems and feedback loops that need to be surgically pulled apart to defeat the root causes in detail while simultaneously undercutting any opponents&#39; ability to fight back. Basically, we need to be a complex, networked problem that is just attacking from too many angles for anyone else to deal with. While fighting a war backed with propaganda is nothing new, the number of fronts and the immediacy of response are. The key to this is increasing global stability by shrinking the scale of violent threats, denying bad actors access to the human resources needed to fight, and empowering local people to govern themselves in a manner that is responsive to their needs. To this end, everything that can be used as a weapon should be used- especially nontraditional methods. If a radical terrorist organization is gaining followers, fight them by simultaneously ending hunger/unemployment in the region, building public schools and infrastructure, getting local people trained as teachers, medical personnel, LEOs, and tradespeople, while also performing surgical strikes against known strongholds, tracking and arresting leaders to give fair public trials to, rooting out corruption, and using diplomatic avenues to deny access to outside funding. This all needs to be coordinated for maximum efficiency of resource denial. The US is easily capable of that level of multifaceted warfare over rather large regions, look at how we rebuilt Japan and Europe while fighting in Korea, for instance, but it would mean cleaning up our house a bit... by performing that process on ourselves first, as an educational process for these systems.<br><br>We need to learn from the FUBAR results of our interventions in Libya, Afghanistan, Iraq, and especially Syria, and rethink how we project force... and why.

My parents work for the military-industrial complex as defense contractors in northern Virginia and you remind me of a lot of the people I knew growing up. I owe my lifelong interest in math and aerospace to many people who, like yourself, were more than just knowledgeable but passionate about imparting said knowledge to the next generation. It is -- much like this channel -- truly a blessing that has led me to where I am now: pursuing a bachelors of science in mathematics. So thank you.<br><br><br>In a couple years, I will have to enter the &quot;real world&quot;. Honestly, I don&#39;t know if I can play the nice suburban moral relativist game that my parents and my neighbors have to play in spite of all the blessings their steady lifelong income provides. Do you see a future where intense infrastructural efforts  like the ones explained in this video are undertaken from the outset for non-militaristic aims? Just as how the federal government created public programs and incentives for private companies to jump start domestic prosperity in the 1950s, I can imagine a similar movement happening again now by applying the paradigm shift of multi-industry interoperability (to differentiate it from the military term &quot;multi-domain operations&quot;) to solve complex issues in our country today. I know it&#39;s <i>possible</i> but is it realistic to expect such a possibility, especially in our multi-domain nuclear weapon filled world? If you have time to answer thanks !

From what I understand (Several members of my family in the military, several friends who fought in war. No service myself) is that one of the problems is that there are not a lot of transferrable skills, especially for combat units. But what the General was saying about empowering soldiers seems to counteract that a bit. Outcome focused leadership, and encouraging initiative in subordinates, seems like a great trait in a manager. Maybe fast tracking veterans into management might be a real possibility.  Or post-service cross-training in problem solving fields, like a lot of manufacturing jobs require. Here&#39;s a need, figure out how to meet that need. I don&#39;t know, it&#39;s just the first thing that came to mind. I probably didn&#39;t state that as well as I would have hoped. Maybe it&#39;s worth exploring more, maybe it ain&#39;t. <br><br><br>The second is what Destin was saying about the art of disagreeing well. My aunt and I have very different political opinions. We have never argued, never gotten angry at each other. And we talk about politics a fair amount. We also hug each other, and watch movies together, and exchange christmas gifts. We love each other. And we have never changed the other person&#39;s mind. I remember a day when we were driving. We were in the car for several hours. And talked politics the entire ride. Well, that&#39;s not entirely true. We also talked architecture. You see, we were in an older part of town, with all the houses unique. And whenever we saw one we liked, we would stop the politics and talk about the house. Then we&#39;d continue. We had more in common with each other than differences due to our political disparity. And we both know how to not become emotionally invested in the outcome of a discussion. We were simply sharing points of view. I understand my aunt a whole lot better, and I think she understands me better too. I don&#39;t agree with her any more than before, but maybe that&#39;s not really the point. Maybe the art of disagreeing well isn&#39;t about argumentation and changing minds, but sharing viewpoints, about understanding each other.<br><br><br>And that&#39;s my two cents spent.", "comment_date": "2019-03-04T06:25:42Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "omega73582", "comment_text": "This......

The messenger and the king discuss frantically how this will bring them ill luck \u2013 travelers would stay in and trade with the other town, and nature will favor the pig over the orange. Advised by his daughter, who stands behind a silken screen to hide herself, the king decides to have the town walls rebuilt to resemble a club, with which to beat the pig away. All is well in the town for a time, but soon the messenger brings news that Kwan-Si&#39;s walls have been reshaped as a bonfire to burn their club. The Mandarin of the first town has the walls changed to a shining lake; Kwan-Si&#39;s are changed to Mouth to drink the lake; the Mandarin&#39;s changed to a needle to sew the mouth; Kwan-Si&#39;s to a sword to break the needle. This goes on for quite some time, driving the cities&#39; inhabitants away from their work at farms or in shops to fruitlessly rebuild the walls and wait for the other&#39;s response. Disease and famine are rampant. At last, the voice behind the silk screen, advising the Mandarin, says weakly &quot;In the Name of the gods, send for Kwan-Si!&quot;\r<br>\r<br>The two Mandarins, both starved and ailing, agree to stop their feud of superstition. The first Mandarin&#39;s daughter shows the men several kites, lying abandoned on the ground. &#39;What are kites,&#39; she asks, &#39;without the wind to sustain them and make them beautiful?&#39; Nothing, they agree. &#39;And what is the sky, without kites upon its face to make it beautiful?&#39; Again, it is Nothing. Thus, she directs that Kwan-Si shall make itself to resemble the Silver Wind, and her town shall be made to resemble a Golden Kite, such that the two should sustain each other and they could live in peace.", "comment_date": "2019-03-04T05:20:08Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Ernesto Kling", "comment_text": "Spectacular video", "comment_date": "2019-03-04T05:19:54Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Red Hed", "comment_text": "Transparency is always good.

Russia and the U.S. are trying to garner as much support and allies as they can. Sometimes in the form of monetary or military support while other times levying penalties in the form of tariffs. Meanwhile, Russian bots and operatives are using the internet to sway opinions, actions, and even elections.

To me, these descriptions don&#39;t quite fit with our modern age.  Bubbles are small, bubbles are your small group of real life friends and family, bubbles are something we had before the internet really took off.  I like to think of what we have today as &quot;biospheres&quot; composed of millions and millions of people all consuming similar content.  For instance, if you&#39;re subscribed to this channel, do you also happen to be subscribed to other channels such as Veritasium, Vsauce, Periodic Videos, Mark Rober, Applied Science, Practical Engineering, Cody&#39;s Lab, or anything by the Hank &amp; John Green brothers?  How about some of the facebook or news sources you follow?  I think we have a huge overlap of similarly minded individuals and a lot of us may share a high percentage overlap in what content we&#39;re consuming, even if it&#39;s not identical from person to person.  I think this creates a situation where we can travel all across the net and think we&#39;re meeting different people with vastly different viewpoints, but actually they&#39;re just more people in our biosphere.  I think for the most part that we never do leave our biospheres completely, and any message we try to convey to those outside our biosphere never actually gets there, it just echoes off the walls and gets &quot;liked.&quot;  If you browse around the big news sites, you find that the comment sections (if they allow comments anymore) are just people hurling garbage at one another, and that&#39;s not productive.  To an extent, I find stepping away from the internet drama hot spots and interacting with people in real life to be far more productive.  Funny thing about the real world is that people with different opinions can be friends and work together and laugh instead of screaming at each other on the internet.  It&#39;s all very strange.

As if to say, look at this really cool military tech, but it&#39;s so mundane compared to the other things we have we won&#39;t even bother talking about it. <br>-In depth explanations of the various domains. <br>-Explanation of the empowerment mindset. (This is 21st century US Army. A good leader knows his junior leadership and their individual strengths, and can assign tasks based on that. The junior guy has a voice and can change the outcome of a situation with that voice. This is the product of a free nation, and our most powerful tool.)<br><br>All of these things amount to what the Army would call a show of force. A very effective preventative action. As the general explained, the best prevention is to show how foolish it would be to challenge us. <br><br>The outcome of this video is manifold. It gives the average American viewer confidence in our military might, while making them more aware of an ever growing threat, and even serving as a recruiting tool. It also tells the foreign nationalist that might be gathering intelligence, \u201c1 We can blow you up before you know we&#39;re there, and we can reach you anywhere. \u00a02 We are well aware of the evolving cyber battlefield, and we&#39;re all over it. \u00a03 Our freedom is what makes us better than you.\u201d<br><br>And the best part - pointing all this out doesn&#39;t make any of it any less effective; the man practically called it out himself when he called this video a weapon.

Also, I believe that Russia runs one of the world&#39;s most sophisticated cyber-forces, not because of the technology they employ, but because of the techniques.

This human domain requires a lot of psychology to use effectively, but it is important, as you said, that knowing that this human domain even exists.<br>I think we are very prone to these psychological warfare through social media or so. Take for instance the Trump election. The idea was ludicrous to some people that an entrepreneur billionaire like him would win presidency just like that, but social media leveraged his ideas greatly, namely through Twitter. <br>The problem we have now is that people are prone to ideas and altering or trying to manipulate them in an effective manner crosses the line of ethics.

Although we may live in the same country, that doesn&#39;t mean we might like each other, partially because humans by nature identify people by contrast more than our similarities. It&#39;s also a problem whether having people to believe that accepting others over differences is a human cause is acceptable for their beliefs in a country like this, where we have freedom of ideas.<br>One of the ways we might be able to achieve unity is by changing education standards to focus more on social interactions and being good to each other.

This is also a big challenge in Engineering.  I recall in a company I used to work at we were understaffed and Top Management had us working on five projects that were all &quot;#1&quot; priority.  I (one silo) was leading one of those projects but the project was not getting the Purchasing (another silo) resources I needed.  What I found out was Purchasing (limited resources) had (in essence) relegated my project to #5 (or you might say, #1.5).  This was happening all over the company; so, every project was lacking resources and no project was actually #1.  The only real solution was to agree that we didn&#39;t have the resources to do everything then make and communicate the difficult choices of what to say no to and empower the silos to win together.

And who knows what masacers will this justifie, we have Yemen and potentialy Venezuela to look at and ask \u00bfis this justified? \u00bf is it ok for the US to inervine yet again? .<br><br>Well this is my sorta rant and sorta opinion, i will say again that i do not intend to personaly atack Destin i am mearly puting some other things that i havent see reflected on the coment section on the table.

You can not stand with a neighbor against a foreign enemy when they both want you dead or on your knees.  &quot;United We Stand, Divided We Fall&quot; has long been an American motto, unfortunately there are a whole lot of &quot;Americans&quot; who aren&#39;t very &quot;American&quot; anymore.

But we should claim the right to suppress them if necessary even by force; for it may easily turn out that they are not prepared to meet us on the level of rational argument, but begin by denouncing all argument; they may forbid their followers to listen to rational argument, because it is deceptive, and teach them to answer arguments by the use of their fists or pistols.

However, the captain of the ship didn&#39;t like that dot on their radar for whatever reason and threateningly ordered down. I don&#39;t have the exact correspondence between the Captain and Pilot/ground control, but &quot;witness reports&quot; stated that the long story short was: <i>&quot;Move, or we&#39;re putting a missile up your %\u20ac&amp;!&quot;</i> ...and Danes are a friggin&#39; harmless people, in a fairly &quot;neutral&quot; country, so me, hearing that on the news, that some U.S. Warship docks in our harbor and decides that everything in a 5+ km radius around them, is now <i>&#39;U.S. territory&#39;</i> and failure to comply with their will and orders would result in missile attacks? ...nope, I didn&#39;t like that at all.<br>It&#39;s possible this captain had a bad day, but still.

How can you combat that? I think Destin is doing a good thing because the best way to combat misinformation is with education, facts, and a lack of bias. I don&#39;t think enough of us (myself included) are doing enough to educate others about the pitfalls of unchecked social media. If you talk about regulation however, it&#39;s hard not to also step on the first amendment or cross over into propaganda. Tough issues to tackle with no solid answers! I hope companies involved in perpetuating social problems through media learn that in the long term, they&#39;re making things worse for everyone  just to turn a profit,  and hopefully can learn to self-regulate in a manner that benefits everyone. <br><br>A lot of these companies now use online analytics data and it is insane at how manipulative companies can be with that data. It doesn&#39;t get enough coverage unfortunately. Lets just say if you thought minority report is creepy with their ad targetting, it&#39;s not far off. There&#39;s also ways retailers can track you without consenting to giving PII data. Everywhere your phone gets tagged and put into a database either with wi-fi or with bluetooth (your phone broadcasts your hardware addresses because that is how it works even if you are not actively connecting to a network), it&#39;s game for a lot of other companies using the same tools. It starts forming a fingerprint of your habbits, where you have been, etc. If at some point you have consented to free wi-fi and given out your email, then you can be tied to all your other data without having given consent the other 99% of the time. Now think about how any business for example can subscribe to Purple (business analytics company) or any other analytics company and pull much of that data. It&#39;s not hard to start seeing where a bad actor can easily subscribe to all this data and ones that are tech savvy enough can run that data through cheap services like AWS and use their machine learning tools to further enhance the results of the data they are looking for. These lists people get from hacked databases like experion that may match your real name to your email address can then be used to search for hits of your hardware address and coupled with all the public wifi points that use analytics like Meraki to determine where specific people are. I understand how that can sound like some tin-foil hat stuff, but I&#39;ve been in IT a long time and this stuff is real. You can easily google &quot;business analytics&quot; and see what kind of tools and data are out there and are cheap and easily available.<br><br>The point of my long-winded rant is I hope people are aware to make better decisions about how their data is gathered passively and can be abused and that these are also the kinds of things the military is looking at now on the cyber warfare front as a vector of attack and is looking at ways to prevent abuse of our data that can potentially do us harm.", "comment_date": "2019-03-03T18:46:26Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "gsilcoful", "comment_text": "Thank you.", "comment_date": "2019-03-03T18:46:25Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "The Stig's Japanese Cousin", "comment_text": "we need Stonehenge rail-gun network and a Arsenal bird", "comment_date": "2019-03-03T18:45:33Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Everardo Servin", "comment_text": "Oorah", "comment_date": "2019-03-03T18:45:30Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Bharath", "comment_text": "Sadly internet warriors are going to be biggest influencers of war one day!

I would only add that if you look at our oftain combative partisan two party system and all the accompanying divisiveness of late, you can trace its antecedents to the French ambassador Edmond-Charles Gen\u00eat&#39;s endeavor to engage American citizens in the wiles of the French Revolution, and George Washington&#39;s response to it. The stryfe over Washington&#39;s insistence on U.S. neutrality in the French, Spanish, and English War led to divisiveness in the cabinet between Washington and Jefferson. This divisiveness accounts for much of the lack of cooperation between the founders in the years between the French Revolution and the creation of the party system by Monroe during the Adams presidency. The moral of the story here is that the divisiveness being sown by Russia, China, and others will have very long lasting, deleterious effects if we can&#39;t manage to be civil with one another. As I was a history major at University, all of this came to mind as you made your closing comments at the end of the video. As a result I will endeavor to do better.

The basic flaws in human logic can be and are exploited to, for instance, increase average watch times on YouTube. That causes damage that we are not used to attributing to a source. <br><br><br>Such as the recent rise of the anti-vax movement. It has been pushed by certain sites because once a person is down that rabbit-hole they are more likely to stay stuck there. Once they&#39;re stuck they, incidentally, see many more ads. It was never the goal of the site to make that person believe in anti-vax, but it was one of the unintended consequences. The problem then is how and who do you hold accountable for the actions of a black boxed algorithm? I don&#39;t know yet and I don&#39;t think anybody else does either.", "comment_date": "2019-03-03T16:37:00Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Mike Lindquist", "comment_text": "Wow!

As an overthinker myself, you touch on many of the subjects that I would dwell on when studying both the world in general and warfare in particular. <br><br>It&#39;s also pretty fascinating that Sun Tzu&#39;s famous words still hold true to a large degree, to this day. You&#39;re grazing the subject in the last sentence, that knowing is half the battle - and I so wish you would&#39;ve gone even more meta, analyzing the concept of knowledge and what actually defines it (again, you&#39;re touching on the subject with stating that everyone has their subjective view of the world). With the information society we&#39;ve developed for the past few decades, the spread and curating (both deliberate and subconscious) of knowledge has accelerated to an insane degree. It&#39;s only natural the concept is being utilized for military purposes, but it&#39;s an extremely fascinating subject to study more in-depth, without a doubt.<br><br>No matter what your occupation may be, both past, present and future, don&#39;t stop learning.

I think the scary reality of the people/cyber issue is that we&#39;ve already lost. These bad actors aren&#39;t creating divisions which didn&#39;t exist, they&#39;re just amplifying ones they find and pushing them away from resolution towards chaos. But these divisions DO exist. We don&#39;t all agree on everything and there are real political struggles to be had over important issues which affect real people. But wow wouldn&#39;t it be convenient for the people in power if we stopped pushing for change because we&#39;ve been made to believe that there is no real dissent, only paid trolls and foreign agents trying to manipulate us. But at the same time, there are some trolls trying to manipulate us and if you&#39;re not always guarded, you risk frustrating yourself or getting mislead by engaging with them. So what is the proper response? If you take people at face value you&#39;ll end up getting taken advantage of by trolls. If you become hypercritical to a point where you think that anyone who disagrees with you  is probably a troll, then you&#39;re just disengaging from the political process and retreating into an echo chamber that favors the status quo over addressing potential problems. The naive answer is that everyone should become their own personal journalist/fact checker/scientist and closely review every piece of information, article, source, etc which you encounter online. But that just isn&#39;t realistic. The world&#39;s just too complicated to verify all information yourself. At some point you need to be able to trust others to provide you with their accounts of the world. But what is that trust based on? Why should I trust the military, the government, this news organization or that, scientists, someone on the internet, etc? Sometimes there&#39;s a satisfying enough answer: Science is trust-able because of it&#39;s methodology and peer-review process; but a lot of the time there isn&#39;t a good answer. <br><br><br>The military clearly has a clear incentive to present this side of them as their narrative: The military is a modern, advanced, rational organization that is putting your tax dollars to good use to try to deter wars that would probably be happening if we weren&#39;t so strong. Don&#39;t worry, we like peace and you should keep funding us and ignoring all of the ways we&#39;ve misused the power we&#39;ve been entrusted with, but also worry about all those scary foreign powers which we&#39;re competing with, also if you see someone objecting to this they&#39;re probably secretly a foreign agent who&#39;s trying to divide our otherwise unified democracy.", "comment_date": "2019-03-03T16:09:13Z", "likes_count": 10}, {"comment_by": "4Dul", "comment_text": "The only video on the Internet which deserve this title", "comment_date": "2019-03-03T16:09:04Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "CountryMo", "comment_text": "The only thing I can think now, is that asking you to make this video, was probably another way to &quot;get ahead of the curve&quot;, this is the cyber domain afterall<br>EDIT <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOTYgcdNrXE&amp;t=21m27s\">21:27</a> oh come on seriously?", "comment_date": "2019-03-03T16:08:53Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Time Remap", "comment_text": "<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOTYgcdNrXE&amp;t=4m25s\">4:25</a><br>Ohhhhhh sinking!
