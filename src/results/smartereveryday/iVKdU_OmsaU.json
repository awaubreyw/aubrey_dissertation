The main thing which sticks with me is Heinrich Wickmann and his pencil up a hen&#39;s bottom.......but it was a great scientific experiment (and the hen apparently never complained.....) and he found out something new which has since been shown with live X-rays but otherwise couldn&#39;t be seen and which we still might not even think about otherwise.....it&#39;s all fascinating stuff.

I learned in ornithology class that birds make a figure 8 (or the horizontal infinity symbol) motion with their wings and I guess the crossover point (the X part) is accomplished by the shoulder rotating I cannot remember which direction? Anyway I think this rotation moment allows the bird to quickly dump the former angle of attack at the completion of the downward thrust stroke allowing the wing to passively return to the power stroke beginning position with the wing  and feathers correctly angled for the next attack at grabbing some fresh undisturbed air.  I tried pretty hard to see and then visualize this figure 8 thing but I cannot. You have far more experience visualizing minute changes reported in your camera shots.  At the end of the voodoo cams slo-mo view you have another camera shot filming the overall scene. This footage shows a much more lengthy version of the flight including many more power strokes (wing beats).  If you slow this replay speed way down (more than you already did) can you possibly see the shoulder rotation and the figure 8 motion played out at the wing-tips? I think it is the wing-tips that scribe a figure 8 not the shoulder. <br>I took this class back in 1980 and I have forgotten 90+ percent of what I learned back then. If this is something that is of interest to you and you have a few minutes, check it out and if you can see how the bird recovers from the bottom end of the power stroke  and can describe it in terms of conservation of angular momentum (or whatever you want to call it) please let me (everyone) know what you see. I could not see it back in 1980 when the professor flapped his arms in demonstration. I do not doubt what he is saying, it&#39;s just I cannot understand what it is I am seeing.

As the incline increased, the partridges began to flap, but they angled their wings differently from birds in flight. They aimed their flapping down and backward, using the force not for lift but to keep their feet firmly pressed against the ramp. \u201cIt\u2019s like the spoiler on the back of a race car,\u201d he explained, which is a very apt analogy. In Formula\u00a0One racing, spoilers are the big aerodynamic fins that push the cars downward as they speed along, increasing traction and handling.

By comparison, our brains are only 2 percent of our body weight. A bit embarrassing to know, that a tiny bird that weighs mere grams has a brain larger than humans in a way. The hummingbird can even fly upside down and can remember items. They can figure out how long to wait between visits so the flowers have time to generate more nectar. They can even recognize humans, and know which ones can be counted on to refill empty hummingbird feeders. <br>So filming hummingbirds would would be a bit of a challenge, but think of all that you could learn from them.", "comment_date": "2018-08-04T03:15:29Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Peter Riis", "comment_text": "Get more birds. \ud83d\ude09", "comment_date": "2018-08-04T03:14:05Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Wooten Basset", "comment_text": "Awesome is often used for things that really aren\u2019t.

You can see from the video when releasing the bird that his reactions are slower than the birds flight. When opening his hand he is understandably looking into his hand at the bird, but between the bird taking off and it leaving the frame, his eyes lag from following the bird. Clearly eyes do not do well with tracking an object, they jump from point to point due to a lack of fine motor movement, but this requires interpolation of where the object of desire will be.<br><br>His brain is working out from the movement it felt and saw where the bird is likely to be when it has had a chance to catch up, and moves his eyes to a position such that he has the bird passing through his centre of focus, while adjusting his head, and focal point, and generally tracking the bird.<br><br>What this makes me wonder is are new borns or certainly very young children capable of this interpolation; how do they track object differently; do some people over estimate, and jump ahead of the object?", "comment_date": "2018-08-03T22:09:55Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Robert Dudek", "comment_text": "A fine Mellon sir lol!

Do you think unequal force was applied between the left and right wing to cause that rotation? Looked like some of the feathers on the right wing brushed your fingers, but that should have caused him to rotate to the left if it was affecting the flight. Looks like it was an intentional controlled rotation. It would be cool to see what down draft pattern a bird makes when taking off. The other neat thing was at 148ms it appears that the bird actually kipps its legs up right before the down stroke. I wonder if they use the weight of their legs for some flying applications?

Nice video, I like to look at and watch birds, in part for health reasons (it is good for your eyes and brain to watch small things moving like that, especially at a distance) but also just because they are beautiful. Was that a type of finch? Maybe a sparrow? (Hey, if it was a sparrow, then maybe Matthew <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iVKdU_OmsaU&amp;t=10m29s\">10:29</a> would have been a good verse.)<br>This video reminded me of a few weeks ago when I was entering my church at night to take out the garbage. I saw what looked like a leaf on the floor in the foyer, but when I turned on the lights I noticed that it was not a leaf, it was a bat. It was alive, and too exhausted to move, so I scooped it up with a couple of pieces of paper (it was small, maybe a few ounces). As I got it onto the paper, I noticed that one of its upper claws was hooked on the edge of the paper, spreading the digits out. It is remarkable how much they look like fingers. Anyway, I brought it outside and placed it on the ground between two trees so it could climb to safety. (Unfortunately,I later discovered that it did not survive.)<br>I have another brief story about a frog, a little tiny frog we found in a large bin with water. It was just about tired out, but we got it out and it jumped away, landing on a tree that it almost perfectly blended in with.
