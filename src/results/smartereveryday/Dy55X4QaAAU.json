Another thing to consider is the thickness of the line, for every shape and brand there is different thickness sizes. If your edging sidewalks, or weed eating somewhere with a lot of rocks, or metal or debris, then you would want a thick round trimmer line. This shape is especially made for not breaking as easy. If your weed eating thick grass or brush with no rocks in the way then I would use the diamond shape. Which looks like a twisted string. An example is the echo black diamond. Also known as \u201csharp square shape. This line is meant for thick grass and weeds. It is not meant for edging, nor weed eating around rocks, fences or debris, because this type of line breaks easy. In my business I only use Husqvarna titanium force. Which is a thick round line.

One of the most important things I consider on a daily basis is cut quality, i.e. how cleanly the grass is cut. Think about it like this: grass is a living thing, like us. If we get a cut, the cleaner it is the easier and quicker it heals. The less chance we have for infection. Likewise with grass. It is susceptible to fungal, viral, and bacterial pathogens like anything else that is alive. So we strive to do as little damage to our plants as possible so they can be as naturally healthy as possible. In weedeaters, cut quality is irrelevant. I think you proved that. All of the string types result in significant tearing well beyond what we would consider &quot;acceptable&quot; on the golf course for our finer turf. So the real answer is one of economy. The better test would be to see which string shape is the most resilient against unnatural obstacles (stuff that isn&#39;t grass).

How the grass is cut or broken on that scale bears remarkable similarities with working hard ground. Being a plant operator i&#39;m intimately familiar with how &#39;blades&#39; operate on a large scale and how seemingly dull edged blades can effectively &#39;cut&#39; better than sharp ones in certain applications, or how a seeming fragile or bulky blade can cut/break far better than a sharp pointy one. Working with machines over 20t i see quite remarkable similarities with &#39;cutting&#39; or &#39;breaking&#39; through ground. I use so many inverted commas because the terms cutting and breaking are so very relative dependant on scale, and this relationship is amplified to me by the similarities I mention. Which brings me to my point that the &#39;best line&#39; doesn&#39;t really exist as it&#39;s determined by what you want from it. The star line gives the best cut as it strikes with so many cutting edges it will always hit the blade well and give a nice finish, however the many point will dull quuckly creating weak points and reducing longevity. The cored lines won&#39;t give as good a finish, but will have far greater durability for professional applications, but for someone like Robert the sharp sharp square would be ideal as he has to work across such a likely wide variety of scenarios (potentially working around hard/abrasive/undulating surfaces), and so a line that never straightens out will give an uneven cut and consequently help increase the work rate and efficiency of an adept user as they don&#39;tneed to work to precisely over large areas. There are other benefits of course to more applications than i&#39;ve mentioned, but for the best cut, my vote is for the star profile line, and i&#39;ll be buying my next reel in this shape to test it out.", "comment_date": "2021-05-01T10:34:00Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "\u0141ukasz Tokarski", "comment_text": "Ummm, we in Poland call it simply (in direct translation) mechanical scythe/gas scythe.

Love your test but.... (this is gonna be a lengthy rant, sorry about that)<br><br>Firstly, you mentioned less noise from the non-circrular cross-sections. This, as I assume you referred to, has to do with a process called vortex shedding. At least that&#39;s what my bodies that study fluids at the high speed imaging laboratory told me. It&#39;s quite a cool phenomenon.<br><br>Anyway I wanted to go on about something else, fracture as that is my main interest. I wanted to point out various, not yet mentioned issues regarding the test. I assume that you agree that this high speed fracture process is of a dynamic nature and that many parameters play a role. Clearly the cross-sectional shape is only one of them, in the video Robert already mentioned the linear density. Some of these effects can have quite the impact on the test. Here two dynamics related examples.<br><br>1) I&#39;m worried about the weight that was added to the grass, which will increase the inertia of the grass, hence it does not move much when it is hit by the grass eater. I do believe that this is not realistic and in many cases the grass might flex away instead of being &#39;cut&#39; or &#39;raptured&#39;.  This could reduce the cutting capabilities of the line. And I would hypothesize that this effect could differ  greatly between the cross-sections.<br><br>2) Rotational speed will affect the cutting performance and is affected by different factors. Imagine that the line is very light and that you&#39;re cutting something tough, as a result cutting it will slow down the line greatly, which might reduce the cutting performance, but this would only be noticeable if you were to cut many blades of grass simultaneously. Similarly lines with more drag are thus also likely to rotate slower. I assume that a lower rotational speed will result in a less stretched line and thus only cut a smaller area at the same time. Which will also influence your mowing speed.<br><br>I also wanted to point out some causes of the difference between the &#39;sharp-sharp square&#39; line and the others like the star shape. Maybe the sharp-sharp line is meant for more professional use. Maybe the line does not become flat in your machine because it does not rotate as fast as Robert&#39;s machine. Faster rotation could flatten out the disk better and alleviate the issue of cutting at two different spots. You can use your camera to check this. Besides the test did not consider the durability of the line. I imagine that this is important for someone like Robert. The tougher like is likely more durable, as a result it could be more cost-effective. After all, you want to eat grass, not have the grass eat your grass eater line ;-)<br><br>It was a cool video to watch, and I learned a ton. Especially cool was to see the difference in fracture of the grass blades, the cleaner cuts do not only cut faster but would also require less energy. And less energy in the fracture of the grass, means more energy remains in the line to cut other grass blades. &#39;Delaminating&#39; the grass blades is highly inefficient as all the cracks will absorb energy, which will likely not only result in slower cutting speeds but also strain your line and likely reduce the lifetime of the line.", "comment_date": "2020-12-29T16:55:28Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Baby Twinkie", "comment_text": "ROBERT!!!!!AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH!!!!!!!", "comment_date": "2020-12-29T05:37:10Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "VorticoseComb1", "comment_text": "this is so extra it is insane... i love it", "comment_date": "2020-12-28T22:00:21Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Mathew Smart", "comment_text": "Star shape has more edges, so less chance of the flat edge hitting", "comment_date": "2020-12-28T13:36:42Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "furzkram", "comment_text": "Plesse STOP talking people Info the NEXT observation nightmare (using v&quot;p&quot;n&#39;s) - will you?<br>Go to Rob Braxman&#39;s channel and educate yourself.<br>Find other sponsors, please!", "comment_date": "2020-12-28T03:42:34Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Free Jay", "comment_text": "&quot;let me hit the bell&quot; <br>what a great fella robert is :)", "comment_date": "2020-12-28T01:17:39Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Free Jay", "comment_text": "Great video!

An asymmetric spiral star pattern, in my estimate, would cut best. My personal theory is that it has the same to do with saw blades. They have square shaped grooves often because cutting wood is less efficient with sharp knife like blades due to the surface friction of wood. Also, the grooves help disperse cut material away from the next blade impact, otherwise you&#39;re just pushing cut debris into the area you need to cut, grinding it up more and losing efficiency. That little &quot;plug&quot; you see fly off of the square blade is exactly what you think. The cut debris gets trapped into those grooves and effectively creates a sphere. However the angular star shape has grooves that are almost larger on the inside, creating more effective cutting surfaces without debris getting in the way.<br><br>The next step I&#39;d try is stress testing them. Find out how much they can cut before breaking.

Every computer in the world &quot;runs&quot; on RAM. A copy any software you run in your OS gets made and stored in RAM but it has to be stored somewhere when the device is off. Even a laser printer &quot;runs&quot; on RAM.

Thanks, Destin! You spoke about the wraps on a car antenna to make it quieter. This may be so but the functional purpose is to slow down the electrons in the antenna. Electrons travel at the speed of light in an antenna. They bounce off the end and come back. The time it takes for them to travel that distance determines the frequency and corresponding wavelength. The wavelength of your car&#39;s radio is 3m, which needs a 1.5m antenna, but your antenna is far shorter than that. If you wrap wire around the antenna it slows the electrons down which extends the observed frequency. The more wraps you use the shorter the antenna can be!

And the shape and obviously plastic quality is the answer here. The sharp edge plastic goes to waste a lot faster compared to the round shaped one. Also when it meets the fence it really wraps around it. The round shape slides around the hard objects and when it hits the hard object it bounces off of it. The sharp edge ones, they don`t bounce off they just wrap around the object until they break.

Store them all submerged in water for a week then try your experiment again.

I have tried a plethora of different types and sizes of string and have so far settled on Oregon gatorline .115\u201d I did recently figure out that I have a gearbox issue which generates an unusually high amount of heat in the spool of the string head. The heat causes brittleness due to losing moisture(hyp) and and welding towards the inside of the spool. In trying to figure this out someone told me about the water for string storage, their reasoning was that most weed eater string is similar to monofilament fishing line which likes to remain wet. All the different brands and shapes of strings acted way better after being stored in water. Once I get the gearbox issue sorted I will be back at trying many different strings.

I owned and operated a commercial landscape company with up to 10 crews of 4-6 people  each. Your test has a flaw. NO BODY cuts one blade of grass, but you. The most important things to a landscaper are the amount of line consumed for even amounts of work, fatigue, and quality of the cut. When cutting lawn grass, round line is consumed less for 2 different reasons. It carries more momentum through thick grass by staying completely extending and reduced drag. The line has to stay flexible too so that it can bend instead of break. There are multiple diameters for running on the different  strengths of line trimmers. We ran ...095 round on 26cc trimmers when cutting municipal grass (weeds, grass, crab grass) but if a worker had to trim for more than an hour at a time he would need to switch to twist line(second best)for reduced vibration to limit hand and arm fatigue. Our guys could grab a line trimmer and hit a powerline easement and trim 4hrs out and 4 hours back. When dealing with a manicured lawn and a smaller powered line trimmer its better to stay with the round and reduce the diameter but stay with a flexible line. It keeps high speeds with clean cuts. The smaller line is like cutting with a shaper knife and the line trimmer stays in its power range. The titanium line you tried is a premium line with great results but very pricey, generic spools of round can be bought online and Shindaiwa makes the best twist line. We went through 5lb spools every week per crew and we got nearly double the time from round as we did any of the other shapes.

Also when dealing with two solids colliding at high speeds the objects tend to behave more like liquids than solids, a follow up to the first study could be seeing how the line passes through a liquid (like water). The star line is only binding to the grass in small surface cross sections whereas the other lines were binding to the grass in larger surface cross sections. You were likely also thinking about a clean cut slightly incorrectly, Conventionally a clean cut is perceived as a cut where no material is lost and the two sides left behind after the cut are parallel. In the case of a weed eater a clean cut is one in which all the material in front of the path of the line is ejected, leaving behind a gap equal to the &#39;diameter&#39; of the line. It&#39;s similar to how you need to take into account the thickness of the blade when making precise cuts with a circular saw.", "comment_date": "2020-09-19T04:21:53Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Nick Flewelling", "comment_text": "New England &quot;Wacker&quot; for life", "comment_date": "2020-09-19T02:43:27Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "GOV 420", "comment_text": "Haven\u2019t watched the video yet but I\u2019m going with my boy oval", "comment_date": "2020-09-19T00:56:09Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Pro Builder", "comment_text": "Those blades of grass remind me of a gazelle at an African watering hole, then the Croc. strikes!", "comment_date": "2020-09-19T00:54:39Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "WeirdBoi", "comment_text": "comedy of the future...", "comment_date": "2020-09-19T00:53:21Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "OutlawToys", "comment_text": "Like a &quot;Crescent wrench&quot; or &quot;Channel Locks&quot; those are brands for andjustable wrench and slip joint pliers but that&#39;s what most call them by that dominant or original brand name.", "comment_date": "2020-09-18T21:05:04Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "inshadowz", "comment_text": "Big props to Robert for being a great sport :)", "comment_date": "2020-09-18T16:52:30Z", "likes_count": 6}, {"comment_by": "jim leane", "comment_text": "&quot;whipper snipper&quot;    \ud83d\ude00 south Australia", "comment_date": "2020-09-18T14:33:41Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Jack Off", "comment_text": "Cleveland says Wacker, we also say Pop, not Soda", "comment_date": "2020-09-18T14:03:19Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "VETTLE1", "comment_text": "Weed eater!", "comment_date": "2020-09-18T10:59:51Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Kye Rafferty", "comment_text": "Know what brand that &quot;weed eater&quot; guy who &quot;weed eats&quot; (still can&#39;t believe you said that) is using??

I end up cutting that faster and cleaner than if I hit all the grass at once.

Resistance to obstacles is also important, how much damage it will do to them and how much damage it takes. Second of all of all, I&#39;m not sure the idea that a clean cut is superior is a foregone conclusion: I don&#39;t know plant biology but I know human biology and a clean cut (razor blade, a paper cut) bleeds much longer and more severely than a ragged cut (from a less sharp edge, a kitchen knife or torn metal).

Don&#39;t do projects or tasks in the forward direction... always go backwards... Meaning figure out your end goal, then work your way backwards to the start and that tell you the best way to accomplish it.  So lawn care, and your &quot;weed eater&quot; test doesn&#39;t have any single end result.  What I mean by this... is what is it you want to accomplish.  So if you want healthy longer living grass, I&#39;d assume a clean cut would help the grass stay green and live longer before browning or drying out.  But that&#39;s isn&#39;t exactly your best outcome for all end uses.  If it&#39;s just your house lawn... sure.  Makes sense.  Now if let&#39;s say this grass field is used for Soccer/football, or some other friction/less friction based end result... then maybe a frayed end of grass is better.  You&#39;d have to do tests for that.  So First determine which line type cuts cleanest and which cuts with the most fraying.  Then do a round of test with say a weight on a stick on a hinge, at a given angular drop, and with a variety of balls, or other sports equipment, and see which cut grass type has more or has less friction.  Then do the test in a practice environment with players and real world scenarios and see if they like or need more friction or less friction on the ball or whatever, to have better game results.  So it would be a multi level testing but that would ultimately be the best use of your initial testing information.  Not to mention, I am sure the final results would be very helpful for professional sports teams of all kinds.  As that kind of possible advantage could make the difference, either in a team on team outcome, or in some &quot;world record speed&quot; type of scenario.  And it might end up leading to mixed results.  Like how golf courses have the length and type of grass different in different zones of the course, what if a soccer field was say cut with the lower friction resulting line on the bulk of the field, but with the higher friction inducing line to cut the grass in the goalie zone... or vice versa... depending on what the player tests shows they prefer.

For example, while one line might cut the cleanest or easiest how does the grass recover from that cut?

I lost the packaging a long time ago and it has lasted me so many years that I am just hoping I will be able to find the same stuff again when I run out. As you demonstrated the difference in noise level I also realised myself that this line is considerably more pleasant to use than regular round line for that reason also. My ONLY complaint with this particular line is that when pieces do snap off (bump the head and the excess gets cut off) and those pieces hit my legs...... they cut flesh VERY well, adding to my pain I started using an 18 volt brushless trimmer instead of the Honda and the slower speed and increased torque seems to only make the pieces aim for my legs better :P big issue in summer because it is TOO HOT to wear long pants but in winter its not so bad :D", "comment_date": "2020-07-10T14:27:47Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "kibukun", "comment_text": "I always heard weed whacker when I grew up in Seattle, and then I heard everybody call it a weed eater in San Diego.", "comment_date": "2020-07-10T13:27:32Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "LinearAnalysis", "comment_text": "It seems like the star may have more of the right turbulating pitch to create more of &quot;golf ball&quot; dimple effect (if the dimples are too deep or large you lose the aerodynamic advantages) as aerodynamic turbulators versus the coarse pitch of the square which I think might trip the turbulence into less stable oscillating state.

As with many dynamic systems, natural system frequencies are to be avoided.  Basically the car drives down the road, and at certain speeds, the antenna will experience shedding vortexes that match the first natural mode  frequency of the antenna (or some multiple thereof) and the antenna ends whips left to right as the car drives forward.  Without the spiral wrap, the frequencies along a length of antenna of similar cross section can happen synchronously and then act on the antenna body as a uniform coherent load.  This can cause fatigue and destroy antennas.  It&#39;s actually pretty cool to watch a plain round antenna whip sideways relative to the vehicle motion for the first time (after you realize why it&#39;s doing it)... although I&#39;m a nerd so maybe it&#39;s not that cool... <br> If you want to &quot;visualize&quot; shedding vortexes as they roll off a round rod in the wind, look at a flag on a pole.  The flag waving motion is literally the vortexes rolling off the flagpole and moving the flag at that frequency.  The frequency of shedding vortexes correlates to fluid (air) density, velocity, and the beam cross section.  Some cars even use sensors to measure the frequency of shedding vortex within the air intake manifold to calculate mass airflow into the engine (for fuel mix ratio mapping).  Shedding vortexes are also a big component in Lab-on-a-Chip micro-fluidic devices.  Neat stuff. <br>Anyways, the spiral wrap just breaks up the coherency of the frequencies along the antenna beam so they can&#39;t act in unison and whip the antenna around.  An alternative method to the spiral wrap is to have an antenna of varying cross sectional thickness from base to tip... which is the primary wind-bucking mechanism used by those old electronic telescoping retracting antennas from the 90s (fat at the base and skinny at the tip).", "comment_date": "2020-07-07T02:51:34Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "TheFerrariGuy458", "comment_text": "In Canada it\u2019s weed wacker", "comment_date": "2020-07-07T02:29:21Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Gustajuy", "comment_text": "Robert seriously just showed up and dropped mad knowledge then dipped<br>What a madman", "comment_date": "2020-07-07T02:28:11Z", "likes_count": 753}, {"comment_by": "Joe Meyer", "comment_text": "@<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dy55X4QaAAU&amp;t=2m18s\">2:18</a> get those wire nuts in a junction box", "comment_date": "2020-07-07T02:20:12Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Austin G.", "comment_text": "Grew up calling it a weed wacker, then got a groundskeeping job and was taught to call it a string trimmer", "comment_date": "2020-07-07T02:17:36Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Sambaillley", "comment_text": "Hi smarter every day.

If I want to test capability against tough weeds, I use yucca leaves, knotweed, garlic mustard, various docks, and thick, matted grasses. These will test string, machine, and user. I test at high RPM&#39;s, because when I do real-world cutting, I approach tough weeds with the string already moving at near max speed. I will also approach at an appropriate linear speed and angle to allow cutting to occur instead of wrap-arounds, bogging, and string-breaking. I use a little slower RPM when edging adjacent to sidewalks and pavements. <br><br>It is very difficult to replicate real-world use with lab-type testing. (E.g., high-RPM, high-torque trimmers use string of various characteristics in ways that differ from lower-RPM, lower-Torque trimmers.) String that weighs less per linear unit might not feed well once it wears down to a length at which heavier string feeds smoothly.

The cases are misdiagnosis of cancer fighting cellular mechanisms, that all people have in their cells and under a micro scope look identical to what they say the &quot;covid 19&quot; looks like. They are released from the cells in high quantities when they need to deal with free radicals caused by 5G. The few extra people who are dying are dying from already being unhealthy and then exposed to the 5G calibration efforts around the world. It&#39;s true that 5G is non-ionizing in the medium of the air; but what they don&#39;t tell you is about how the refraction index affects it when it passes from a medium of air to a medium of liquid like your body, which shrinks the wavelength to the considerately smaller. This is how it can then become looped in specific sized cells, capillaries, and small organs and glands. And then build up to a level of becoming ionizing. At which point it will start burning you with radiation burns just as doctors have reported finding in the lung tissues of some of the dead. The test they are using to diagnose covid was created to detect cancer; that&#39;s why it&#39;s so easy to misdiagnose a new virus that supposedly looks identical. The global telecomunication conglomerates of the world have spent far to many billions of dollars building up the the 5G network around the world to be able to avoid going bankrupt if they threw it away; or if they took the financial responsibility for the damages it is causing during it&#39;s calibration stage of set up. Once they have mastered the levels and intervals of how to use it in a safe way. It will be like an unloaded gun pointed at your head instead of a loaded gun pointed at your head; and that&#39;s safer. If they ever wanted to use it as a weapon they will be able to but don&#39;t have to if they don&#39;t want to. This stealth smart weaponry is what they offer to the governments in exchange for it&#39;s compliance with the covid cover-up.<br>There is still so much more to say of course but I hope that helps you better understand what is happening, and give you some direction for you to go and research.

And I think that may very well make a huge difference. For example, some lines might perform better because they bite into the slack grass blades instead of merely striking them. Some still might be able to get more grass in a single motion because of density or shape. Additionally, as you mentioned yourself, there are other variables to consider.

You can buy the ugly triangle shape line that comes pre-cut..I just buy it on a spool and pre-cut myself.  The triangle line made by ugly does a good job, but it tends to fray faster after 10-15 min.. The oregon gray line is a bit lighter than the ugly line and it seems to hold up longer not needing to change out the lines.  It spins faster on the head too it seems.

The star has two leading planes hitting the grass nearly perpendicular, thus doubling the funneling effect of the square, but just behind those are two more planes that have a much more dramatic offset which would work to push the severed edges of the grass blade apart.  Additionally, the star shape also has a single leading point, which would start the cut more cleanly while the four concave planes continue the cleanliness of the cut by gently (well, as gently as 10,000 rpm can be anyway) pushing the severed grass blade apart.  The square shape has two leading edges on the top and bottom that cut the grass blade into three distinct parts, the middle of which gets funneled into the single perpendicular concave plane.", "comment_date": "2020-06-30T05:49:56Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "drumboarder1", "comment_text": "Literally all of Australia calls it a weed whacker &quot;maybe if you live in Australia then you&#39;ll call it a strimmer&quot;", "comment_date": "2020-06-30T05:48:08Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Hellen Keller", "comment_text": "Me skipping through apologies to see weed wacker go brrrrrr", "comment_date": "2020-06-30T05:46:02Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Arthur McFarlene", "comment_text": "weedy durr", "comment_date": "2020-06-30T05:44:28Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "coffee_candy", "comment_text": "&quot;in the future, humor will be randomly generated&quot;", "comment_date": "2020-06-30T05:42:57Z", "likes_count": 207}, {"comment_by": "Mawey", "comment_text": "Lol I always said weed wacker im from Michigan", "comment_date": "2020-06-30T05:42:07Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Alex Anders", "comment_text": "Robert was good", "comment_date": "2020-06-30T05:40:17Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Leigh B", "comment_text": "I wonder if the star would make the grass less itchy to sit on since it has a cleaner cut.

I mean you use the lawnmower for the grass and use the weedeater to shape it because it can cut anything at any angle.  The test should have been on real thick weeds that require at least a good 10 second to cut cleanly.  Thin lines are for people who cut their grass every other day and they pull the weeds before they become problematic. Most people i think would be wasting their money on such a thing because the thicker lines last way longer. I think physically the most efficient system would be a circular wire, though that is dangerous for the potential fire hazard while in use, so cutting efficiency isnt the only thing you think about with this kind of thing. The efficiency that most matters is cost. And i was hoping to see some of the weed eaters that have actual spinning blades, but maybe i zombied out for a second on that one.

The cell walls of grass are stacked horizontally in strips of cells but the structure of the cell wall itself is cross hatched. These crossed beams of cellulose are bound by pectin, a structural protein. So what I\u2019m thinking is, is that if these are stacked horizontally, it\u2019s like when people punch layers of wood boards - where, in this case, the grass is reinforced by multiple layers of cell walls. Therefore, although given the same acceleration, a more linearly dense line would provide more force, at least for the square line, it\u2019s doing so over a larger area of grass in a direction in which grass is much more structurally stable. What the star does is take advantage of that. By making contact with essentially 2 wedges on each end of any given point of contact, as well as a much smaller valley in between them, you are causing the grass to bunch up towards a much smaller point, which means it stretches the areas around it length-wise (which goes back to the fact that grass isn\u2019t that strong vertically). Therefore the cellulose bands in the cell walls are stretched as well, making them a lot more structurally unstable, giving you a cleaner cut with the star.

This allows the antenna to resonate at a longer frequency than it would otherwise, at the cost of efficiency (which goes down across the spectrum, but goes up at the resonant frequency of the antenanna) and bandwidth (which becomes narrower). In the US, broadcast radio antennas have to be able to receive signals between 85MHz and 112MHz, which have wavelengths between 3.5m (11.5&#39;) and 2.7m (8.9&#39;), respectively. Your classic car antenna will be what&#39;s called a &quot;1/4-wave ground plane&quot;, indicating that it aims to electrically about 1/4 as long as the wavelength it&#39;s designed to receive and that it&#39;s using the car&#39;s body as a ground plane, which effectively acts as the other half of the antenna. An unloaded, or straight, antenna, would thus be 2.9 feet to 2.2 feet long.<br><br>You can see a more extreme version of this in the &quot;shark fin&quot; antennas on newer cars as well as the fact that devices which are smaller than 2&quot; across are somehow able to receive 2.4GHz wi-fi signals.", "comment_date": "2020-06-29T16:28:07Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "ManInBlack1612", "comment_text": "But the grass is under tension.

Typically the round profile lines last longer than the other shaped styles when purchased in the same string guage, with the squares being a close second. That said the squares seem to leave a more even cut (i mean all grass blades in relation to each other, individually they may shear though often less then the rounds shear them) than the rounds, and hold up fairly well to daily use and do decent on thicker weeds. That stars tend to leave a better cut (individual blades) but often tend to wear quicker. As for the triangles, ive usually seen roughly the same performance as square strings except they are quieter but then again dont last quiiiiiite as long. Ultimately it depends on ure need. Star: well manicured, withough dense weeds, few rocks/fence obstacles. Round: USUALLY economical, long lasting(even with hard obstacles), often louder, and sometimes have to go over same spot a couple times. Square/triangles: basically a middle ground between the two. Not perfect by any means. Doesnt cut as &quot;clean&quot; as star, but usually one pass will do dense weeds, doesnt last as long as round but still long enough to be worth it. Ironically we settled on 2 varieties, 1 of which was the same as ur local trimmer guy. SIDENOTE: that titanium style does seem to last the longest, and not sure if its the real reason, but a few trimmer dealers had said the grooves along its length were to help the &quot;push feed&quot; style trimmer heads be able to better grab the line.

I read recently that if an alien, 68 million light years, looked through a telescope at earth they would be looking at the dinosaurs. I\u2019m having trouble understanding the theory behind this. Does that mean that if you left earth in a rocket and travel a million light years away you could watch things that have happened whilst you were on earth? How far away do you have to be for there to be a change in earth? 10 light years? 100,000 light years? Is there a way to test it on a smaller scale? If you\u2019re travelling behind a car and the car flips, will someone 5 kilometres away see the flip at EXACLTY the same time?

Whoever has seen me has seen the Father. How can you say, \u2018Show us the Father\u2019? Do you not believe that I am in the Father and the Father is in me? The words that I say to you I do not speak on my own authority, but the Father who dwells in me does his works. Believe me that I am in the Father and the Father is in me, or else believe on account of the works themselves. Truly, truly, I say to you, whoever believes in me will also do the works that I do; and greater works than these will he do, because I am going to the Father. Whatever you ask in my name, this I will do, that the Father may be glorified in the Son. If you ask me anything in my name, I will do it. If you love me, you will keep my commandments.  And I will ask the Father, and he will give you another Helper, to be with you forever, even the Spirit of truth, whom the world cannot receive, because it neither sees him nor knows him. You know him, for he dwells with you and will be in you. I will not leave you as orphans; I will come to you. Yet a little while and the world will see me no more, but you will see me. Because I live, you also will live. In that day you will know that I am in my Father, and you in me, and I in you. Whoever has my commandments and keeps them, he it is who loves me. And he who loves me will be loved by my Father, and I will love him and manifest myself to him.\u201d Judas (not Iscariot) said to him, \u201cLord, how is it that you will manifest yourself to us, and not to the world?\u201d Jesus answered him, \u201cIf anyone loves me, he will keep my word, and my Father will love him, and we will come to him and make our home with him. Whoever does not love me does not keep my words. And the word that you hear is not mine but the Father&#39;s who sent me.\u201d\u201d\r<br>\r<br>\u201cNow there was a man of the Pharisees named Nicodemus, a ruler of the Jews. This man came to Jesus by night and said to him, &quot;Rabbi, we know that you are a teacher come from God, for no one can do these signs that you do unless God is with him.&quot; Jesus answered him, &quot;Truly, truly, I say to you, unless one is born again he cannot see the kingdom of God.&quot; Nicodemus said to him, &quot;How can a man be born when he is old? Can he enter a second time into his mother&#39;s womb and be born?&quot; Jesus answered, &quot;Truly, truly, I say to you, unless one is born of water and the Spirit, he cannot enter the kingdom of God. That which is born of the flesh is flesh, and that which is born of the Spirit is spirit. Do not marvel that I said to you, &#39;You must be born again.&#39; The wind blows where it wishes, and you hear its sound, but you do not know where it comes from or where it goes. So it is with everyone who is born of the Spirit.&quot; Nicodemus said to him, &quot;How can these things be?&quot; Jesus answered him, &quot;Are you the teacher of Israel and yet you do not understand these things? Truly, truly, I say to you, we speak of what we know, and bear witness to what we have seen, but you do not receive our testimony. If I have told you earthly things and you do not believe, how can you believe if I tell you heavenly things? No one has ascended into heaven except he who descended from heaven, the Son of Man. And as Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness, so must the Son of Man be lifted up, that whoever believes in him may have eternal life. &quot;For God so loved the world, that he gave his only Son, that whoever believes in him should not perish but have eternal life. For God did not send his Son into the world to condemn the world, but in order that the world might be saved through him. Whoever believes in him is not condemned, but whoever does not believe is condemned already, because he has not believed in the name of the only Son of God. And this is the judgment: the light has come into the world, and people loved the darkness rather than the light because their works were evil. For everyone who does wicked things hates the light and does not come to the light, lest his works should be exposed. But whoever does what is true comes to the light, so that it may be clearly seen that his works have been carried out in God.&quot; After this Jesus and his disciples went into the Judean countryside, and he remained there with them and was baptizing. John also was baptizing at Aenon near Salim, because water was plentiful there, and people were coming and being baptized (for John had not yet been put in prison). Now a discussion arose between some of John&#39;s disciples and a Jew over purification. And they came to John and said to him, &quot;Rabbi, he who was with you across the Jordan, to whom you bore witness\u2014look, he is baptizing, and all are going to him.&quot; John answered, &quot;A person cannot receive even one thing unless it is given him from heaven. You yourselves bear me witness, that I said, &#39;I am not the Christ, but I have been sent before him.&#39; The one who has the bride is the bridegroom. The friend of the bridegroom, who stands and hears him, rejoices greatly at the bridegroom&#39;s voice. Therefore this joy of mine is now complete. He must increase, but I must decrease.&quot; He who comes from above is above all. He who is of the earth belongs to the earth and speaks in an earthly way. He who comes from heaven is above all. He bears witness to what he has seen and heard, yet no one receives his testimony. Whoever receives his testimony sets his seal to this, that God is true. For he whom God has sent utters the words of God, for he gives the Spirit without measure. The Father loves the Son and has given all things into his hand. Whoever believes in the Son has eternal life; whoever does not obey the Son shall not see life, but the wrath of God remains on him.\u201d", "comment_date": "2020-06-29T10:43:08Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "faceshed", "comment_text": "I don&#39;t think your data is usable.

It looks to me like when a flat side of the line strikes the grass flush it seems to break though cleanly, but when a pointy edge strikes the grass first, it winds up shedding the grass. Makes me think that the front of the line probably always breaks the grass fairly cleanly, and it&#39;s the sides that shred the grass as they pass along the freshly cut edge. The cleanest cut will occur therefore if the leading edge is fat and the trailing edge is thin.<br><br>What this means is that the ideal line should be faceted. The ideal number of facets is a bit hard to figure though. If you have too few facets the chance of hitting the grass somewhat edge on is high which will expose the grass to the sides of the line and shred the grass (ie the triangle). But if the number of facets is too high, the facet will be too small and thus also expose the grass to the sides of the line (ie the circle).", "comment_date": "2020-06-29T09:17:25Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Josh", "comment_text": "If you are cutting harder stuff, buy a brush cutter head.

If you watch the footage, there is a lot of the surface area striking the fibers in the blades of grass. In this case you are getting a rip or a tear because it is taking a strike a broad edge of grass fibers.<br>With the star shape, it is more uniform with the edges and it has about two or three of the &#39;bursts&#39; or projections that hit and cut at slimmer portions of grass fibers, making a cleaner cut. I think this is the reason the star shape has a cleaner tear, and a better rotation because it is not twisting and forcing a blunt line through the air as far as the aerodynamics are concerned.<br>To better illustrate, it is like swinging a club or bat at a piece of bamboo.

I see it here with Robert (making him an expert, thinking his choice in line was best immediately, saying things like &quot;we should make Robert in charge of this video!&quot;), and in past videos (the one that comes to mind is the one about grain bins with the farmers).  While this is indeed humbling, it is all too familiar to my own behavior.  I also would go out of my way to make blue collar folk feel superior to me in smarts. I have a Ph.D. from Penn State and my background is in quantum sensing and applied electromagnetics.  I would say things like, &quot;I have more respect for you guys doing the REAL work out there than any of the people I work with.&quot;  Or even just treat them like they were all knowing when they told me something (even if I knew they were wrong). I would even become very angry when people suggested educated folks are in any way superior/more knowledgeable than them.  I made it clear that I am on THEIR side.<br>What I have come to find out for me personally, is that these behaviors are the result of a &quot;father wound.&quot;  My father was NOT educated, and was not ever highly achieved.  He didn&#39;t know better and was never able to teach me anything useful in life (for the most part).  I learned early in life that I was more capable than him and developed a codependent type of relationship where I take care of him emotionally to never make him feel lesser.  Since as a child, father = all men in the world, and mother = all women in the world, this led to me acting codependent towards other people who reminded me of my dad in some way (blue collar folk) and I would go over the top to make them feel important and better than me.  All of this is parent-child role reversal and is actually no good for personal growth (namely, the dad is supposed to make the child feel important, not the other way around).   In reality, its a longing from your childhood self to have the dad you never had, one that knows better and can teach you things about the world.  <br>Again this is my story, but I just wanted to comment about it again because I find behavior (my own especially) fascinating.  It took lots of books and work to realize all this about myself, and when I see similar behavior in others it gets my attention and sometimes actually helps me learn more.   <br>Take care!", "comment_date": "2020-06-29T02:58:28Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Layne The Bread Lord", "comment_text": "I use weed eater and weed wacker interchangeably because if I forgot one I have the other as backup", "comment_date": "2020-06-29T02:58:01Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Epic Man", "comment_text": "<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dy55X4QaAAU&amp;t=0m45s\">0:45</a> whoever searches whipper snipper come out now and accept your punishment or we will find you and double the punishment", "comment_date": "2020-06-29T02:57:35Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Adam Frederick", "comment_text": "Weed whacker", "comment_date": "2020-06-29T02:57:16Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Ian Kelly", "comment_text": "Would love to see how each line interacts with the fencing from the last video", "comment_date": "2020-06-29T02:57:10Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Scotty Darnell", "comment_text": "Definitely a weed eater here in North Carolina. \ud83d\ude02", "comment_date": "2020-06-29T02:57:04Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Brian Gerken", "comment_text": "Watching a video on string trimmer line cutting ability is peak dad mode.

A second possibility/think that could happen is that the it hits on the flat side and forces it into the center of the slope/canyon where it then splits as the pressure from the wire breaks the tensile strength of the portions of grass that are within the trough/slope <br>Edit: btw watching on my ps4 and responding on my phone before robert gives his oppinion<br>Edit: Also being the second lightest line it will possibly have less drag/resistance in the air possibly allowing it to spin and cut better while also requiring less power over time to keep spinning", "comment_date": "2020-06-29T02:23:44Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Joe Sivon", "comment_text": "Instead of just testing them on grass you should try different types of weeds.

The weed eater brand is currently owned by Poulan, which makes other brands of outdoor power equipment. As for the trimmer line, we test with round line and what we call twist line, which is the tri-color line you showed. The reason for both is the round line has a higher load on the engine, because of the higher air resistance. Some engines don\u2019t like high rpm\u2019s, so we usually use round line on those. Additionally, the length of the line helps load the engine more, so extending the \u201cswath\u201d to 17\u201d, or 8.5\u201d per side (from the center of rotation) usually loads the engine well. If the engine is running too slow, we bring the swath in, and of it isn\u2019t enough, we switch the line to twist line. I really enjoy your content!

I expect the &quot;best&quot; line would be one that optimally balances its mass and its diameter. Shaped lines that have points would seem intuitively like the best bet since they would have a sharp edge to cut with, but as you noted in the video, to have corners means to have flat surfaces between them, and the radius of a flat surface would approach infinity. I think that having these shaped cross-sections might help with trade-offs, one way or the other, but I think the &quot;optimal&quot; line would be perfectly cylindrical, with a low enough diameter as to truly cut the grass, and a high enough mass to physically drive the cut. You also mentioned the stiffness as a factor, in how it cuts in two places, I don&#39;t think that should have much bearing on the clean-ness of a cut (unless you want to minimise pieces of grass cut at the midsection of the blade). It would probably affect your cutting &quot;flow&quot; to have to think about two cutting planes, or effectively only use half of your cutting line if the higher line never gets to make contact with the grass. Maybe it&#39;s too dangerous, but what about testing with metal wire instead of the plastic? It should be flexible enough to straighten itself out after hitting grass, though might be ruined by hitting a hard object like a fence... Still, metal being more dense than plastic, I think comparing metal and plastic of equal diameters would show that density (or rather, total mass) matters more than cross-sectional profile. Also, though harder to test, line materials that have different diameters with equal mass, the lower diameter lines should cut better for a given mass. Like, imagine whacking the weeds with a pool noodle vs razor wire (not that these would have equal masses for a given length of line, but you get the idea)", "comment_date": "2020-06-29T00:05:46Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Jeff Voss", "comment_text": "Is it just me or did it feel like he planed that paper there \ud83d\ude02", "comment_date": "2020-06-29T00:05:41Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Tony Fleming", "comment_text": "OK, scissors are the BEST!

I operated a weed trimmer in my younger years and one of the considerations to take into account was how fast the line shortened towards the spool housing the line. The shorter it got the faster the head could spin, to a certain extent. If it got too short it would spin really fast but cut ineffectively simply because there wasn&#39;t enough line out. Most weed trimmers have a guard that deflects flying grass and other objects away from the operator&#39;s feet as even a weed trimming line can propel a small object very fast. The guard usually also trims the line ends so that they&#39;re approximately the same length, usually by having the line hit a piece of metal designed to shear off the line at the desired length.

The star shape is the farthest away from cylindrical without any flat faces and probably generates a ton of totally uniform turbulence that keeps it spinning in a nearly perfectly flat disc, like a rigid saw blade. Circular cross section is among the worst aerodynamic shapes going and most likely to do the semi-chaotic bifurcation &quot;dance&quot; as the forces collapse and rebuild around either side of its direction of travel, pushing it up and down the axis of rotation. Triangular, as Destin says, has flat faces that also cause chaotic movement.

There is alot of surface area that is acting with force upon the rope and you can see that in how the rope react and in the feedback you feel in your arms, it&#39;s kinda chaotic. Now if you were to hit it again but with the smaller side of a flat hang (pinky first) you get a less chaotic pattern in the rope and it is clearer where the rope gives way for the force you project on it. Now if you do this again, but at two points at the same time, you get the same result at the points of impact, but there is space in the middle that the force doesn&#39;t effectively disperse to since you hit it with so little surface area. If you put these two point closer together, then eventually you&#39;ll find the sweet spot where the center does give way and act sort of the same as the two places of impact, which should make it a pretty clean push.

If you just want to cut a branch, why removing a wide section of it? You want to go through, not across.

Robert could not have come at a more opportune time. The additional revolutions on the lighter lines is an excellent observation.

The six points of the star line have two cutting edges each. The star line&#39;s twelve cutting edges give a higher likelihood of a cut rather than a tear. (Sorry I said cutting edges a lot.

Less mass (lighter weight line) yields more acceleration, as Robert said, to maintain the force needed.  Yet, in heavier/thicker grass or weeds, the acceleration bleeds off quickly and the line loses the force necessary and then relies on the torque of the engine to force its way through the grass.

If you want to cut the grass and then leave it where it lays, the smaller diameter sounds like the better choice.

Thin line tends to sheer off or break when in close contact with a hard surface, such as a metal fence, concrete, synthetic siding, or a tree as opposed to cutting deeply into the surface, which allowed for a wider margin of error when trimming these areas.

The behavior of whatever we&#39;re trying to cut will influence that. In the last video, you commented on how the direction of approach is meaningful due to the direction of travel of the line and also the grass. In this video, you commented on the aerodynamics of the triangular line making the line quieter (presumably allowing the line travel faster and the engine having reduced load from the line itself). <br>Grass doesn&#39;t stay upright and I doubt it&#39;s under that much tension for any appreciable amount of time.

Does the shape of the line have a meaningful influence on this behavior?<br>I could see a scenario where the stiffer line is better for cutting grass specifically because it&#39;s able to approach blades of grass bent towards and also away from the string. The stiff line seemed to be curled upward on one side and downward on the other -- maybe the end curved upward approaches blades bent toward the line at an angle closer to 90 degrees while the downward curved end approaches blades bent away from the line closer to 90 degrees.

Maybe use the trolley to cut a consistent strip of grass in the garden at the same velocity with each line and compare the results?<br>Destin and Robert identified the potential merits of using and the Star or Sharp(Sharp) Square in different scenarios; I think it would be great to test that theory on different grass/foliage densities as well.<br>Furthermore, Robert&#39;s long-term experience and familiarity with Weed Eaters is an important asset and cannot be understated; it would be interesting for him to use each of the lines in his daily work, then report back his findings afterwards.

The initial cut is made by the furthest point forward (think 3 oclock, or parallel to the direction of travel). Then as it travels forward, it meets the second cutting point (1-2 oclock or 45 degrees from the direction of travel). This provides another defined point for impact with the grass making a shallower cut than the first one. The line continues moving forward and meets the third cutting point (12 oclock or 90 degrees from the direction of travel) allowing another even more shallow cut. This is providing 3 cuts of the grass strand per pass of the wire.<br>What i believe happens is that with the other cutting line shapes is that the lines are only making 1 cut per pass and are therefore imparting all their energy into one point and causing the grass strand to effectively &quot;explode outwards&quot; causing sheering and leaving a ragged edge. <br>The Star line is making multiple cuts per pass and is therefore imparting its energy into the grass strand at multiple point. Even with that the energy imparted by the line is going to be the same overall as the other lines (especially on the first cutting point), so the grass should be exploding and sheering just the same. But i think that the star lines second and third cuts at more shallow angles out pace the sheering effect that is travelling up the strand cutting it off before it can be transferred any farther and because of the shallower angles its imparting less energy to the grass so it will cut instead of sheer it.<br>PS.

I havent done enough research about the principle but i believe it has to do with the &quot;viscosity&quot; of air, and the fact that air moving near a surface is adhering to the surface slowing it down. <br><br>  I feel like the star strand has smaller divits, hence making the strand less likely to have straglers that are prone to causing rips. But the sharp sharp square has much larger divits hence the blade, once cut, is likely to get caught in the divit and be trapped by the no-slip boundary principle, since the strand is not cut on both sides, the piexe stuck in the divit will pull the grass and cause it to tear.<br><br>Also the shape of the strands could make it possible for the grass cut better because, (what i see is) it is more likely for the star strand to hit the blade on a sharp part rather then the sharp sharp square (because it has more sharp parts )<br><br>I really love your videos and i hope to hear from you more, you are one person who has definately made me smarter as a person and i really appreciatr bow you are still trying to get smarter eventhough we are in a crisis ( like there is no time where you cannot get smarter ).

Ive been using that titanium line for years mostly because I don\u2019t want to buy more before I use it all.

I\u2019m interested in if a higher density line is better or lower but \u201csharper.\u201d I suspect something more durable would be less aggravating...adding more line is a big time waster!", "comment_date": "2020-06-28T16:35:02Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Brody Smith", "comment_text": "love you Destin, you&#39;re an amazing person.", "comment_date": "2020-06-28T16:35:01Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "purplegrapiest", "comment_text": "Nah mate she&#39;s a whipper snipper.", "comment_date": "2020-06-28T16:35:01Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Maeyanie", "comment_text": "Interesting, but unfortunately my grass isn&#39;t a species which is held under tension by a weight.", "comment_date": "2020-06-28T16:34:55Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Ty B", "comment_text": "Early", "comment_date": "2020-06-28T16:34:55Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Carinae", "comment_text": "Humor will be randomly generated in the future<br><br><b>W E E D E A T E R</b>", "comment_date": "2020-06-28T16:34:53Z", "likes_count": 91}, {"comment_by": "3rdHalf", "comment_text": "I usually take round one with stiff core.

The bend of the grass blade would have a huge effect on the effectiveness of trimming line. When taught the star might &quot;cut&quot; better than other lines that just &quot;whack&quot;, but when just standing up the different lines might act very different.<br>It would also be interesting to test durability of different lines going through different plants. I would agree with the assumption that a thicker line lasts longer especially through tough brush, but who knows until it&#39;s actually tried.<br>I keep thinking about this and coming up with more things to try. Sometimes in the course of edging around sidewalks and stuff the line contacts dirt (if you&#39;re more highly skilled than I was at 16 you don&#39;t, but I wasn&#39;t, and everybody bites the dust sometimes). What lines stand up best to that kind of punishment? Also, what effect does the power or RPM of the weed whacker have on all this? Is an electric machine just as good or does it loose the torque needed? How fast can you swing through grass and it still be effective, or is there a ratio between power or RPM and max trimming speed? The line thins out at the end when trimming.

Does the shape of the line deteriorate after moderate use, e.g. the star shape becomes more round? If you&#39;re cutting tall grass you end up cutting each blade more than once as the grass falls down onto the line. In that case, does a pulverized piece of grass (i.e. not clean cut) give less resistance later on once you get outside the context of a single blade cut? <br>As for those plugs that get pulled away, the star line is exactly like the sharp sharp square, but on a smaller scale. It still pulls the grass into the middle of those points, but since it&#39;s smaller, the physics work in its favor to not rip out large chunks. Short flexible stuff is more rigid than long flexible stuff. Since the groves on the sharp sharp square are wider, longer pieces of grass fit in there. Another way to think of it is to go back to the other video. Instead of the fence cutting the wire, this time the wire is cutting the grass. That same &quot;pulley&quot; physics are at work here with the grass wrapping around the wire. With the smaller groves, there isn&#39;t room for the grass to wrap all the way around the wire and get the same tension break you were seeing where large chunks of wire were breaking off on the fence.", "comment_date": "2020-06-28T16:16:05Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "JWP", "comment_text": "in CA i&#39;ve only ever heard weed whacker", "comment_date": "2020-06-28T16:16:01Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Laughingpug", "comment_text": "I&#39;m assuming all of it&#39;s rip and tear because the line isn&#39;t sharp  it&#39;s cutting by brute force alone", "comment_date": "2020-06-28T16:15:56Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Macrobioscopic", "comment_text": "The fact that Robert is not objecting and play along is quite admirable", "comment_date": "2020-06-28T16:15:56Z", "likes_count": 2380}, {"comment_by": "Martin Hansen", "comment_text": "This seems like a very bad representation of reality because of the weight you add.

I figured out this refined method after I made a YouTube video about how to make the hat. I used to use the straws that come with Capri Sun. The soldering iron way is better. Anyway, what I look for is color. I like heavy gauge clear weedeater line. I also use it as a stiffener in the cases I sew for my PCB board games, like piping, but it&#39;s stiff.
