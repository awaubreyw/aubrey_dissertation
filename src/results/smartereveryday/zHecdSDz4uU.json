So we get on the horses, no reigns just a peg on the saddle. 5 minutes later with only 5 minutes experience of riding a horse he says &quot;now, we gallop&quot;. The horse takes off and i&#39;m thinking &quot;why did I trust this guy, he&#39;s crazy&quot;. After not dying for about 20 minutes on and off  we stop at a local cafe. He tells my SO, your horse is &#39;the crazy horse&#39;!  We finish coffee and a bite and head back, at a gallop. Of course, i&#39;m on the &#39;crazy&#39; horse now. and it was crazy..Galloping and then coming to a full stop to eat some random leaf and taking off again. We got back to his house safe and sound if not a little shook up. I see the same experience here. Turks be crazy, but crazy fun. looking back,  I wouldn&#39;t trade that experience for anything.

Great video, as always. In my opinion, The Great Courses Plus would be an outstanding match for Smarter Every Day. I have only glanced through the subjects (many of them look like something I could really get into).  I haven&#39;t signed up for the free month (yet), but I think I probably will before the end of the day.  When I was in college, I loved the lectures and learning, but the exams (especially the finals) always felt like the Sword of Damocles hanging over me.  I majored in Wildlife Management (I was a Park Ranger), but I&#39;ve always had an interest in science, engineering and technology, and now that I&#39;m retired I have often thought about taking a class here and there for fun, but I want the knowledge without the formal setting of a classroom and without the tests.  I don&#39;t want or need to do it for the sheepskin or a bunch of letters after my name.  The Great Courses Plus offers a way to expand your knowledge on a subject that interests you, and you can do it at home - and don&#39;t have to worry about a test. I noticed most of the subjects I was interested in were something like 24-27 lectures in length, so I&#39;m quite sure they will thoroughly cover the subject material in far more detail than I even want.", "comment_date": "2016-12-28T14:43:58Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Kevin Pinel", "comment_text": "welcome to the crazy place called the red centre. it&#39;s an amazing place that everyone should see", "comment_date": "2016-12-28T10:29:07Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Prairie Climber", "comment_text": "hey!!!   ....

The set up is easy enough. I&#39;m already familiar with the Great Courses through their many selections on Audible. The great thing about Audible is that they allow you to download the course guide along with the audio tracks. This allows for a seamless integration between the lectures and the study time. I&#39;m disappointed at this point that the Plus streaming does not allow even a discounted purchase on the study materials. I found a course on Latin and wanted to see the quality. I figured it would be a good deal; I can review what I already know and show my girlfriend so she can get some familiarity. Nowhere can I find the study material the professor alludes to. I said before, I&#39;d be willing to spend a little bit just to download the study materials. Maybe you could mention this to them next time you talk. I may not keep it for very long if I can&#39;t conveniently use or access the study material. In theory the idea is great, and the lectures are high quality, but something is certainly missing. I would hope the issue could be fixed; I really like the Great Courses idea.

But the issue that I have is this: <br><br>* Rather than pay-per-course, it requires a subscription/membership, with your billing information on an automatic renewal...which we all know what that means. Extra work to have to cancel. <br>*I could not find a catalog of courses/ topics to survey prior to being required to sign up for a membership - no way to know if there&#39;s enough interesting content/courses for my interests. <br>* Get ready for sticker shock! It&#39;s hella expensive, (particularly in light that there&#39;s so much free content already available online!) <br>* Only available as a streaming-only service, mobile apps require a wireless connection. <br>* I think the term &#39;courses&#39; can be misleading. Yes, the content is prepared &amp; delivered as a conventional &#39;course&#39;, but you don&#39;t actually earn any formal credit/hours from completing the course. This is purely for the joy of learning. <br>* Lacks course materials and closed captioning at launch.<br>* In the end, this company is for profit, and although you gain knowledge and learn...this is exactly what the internet (which is free) already provides in a very robust way. YouTube alone is a platform with millions of &#39;courses&#39; and educational/knowledge sharing videos. Also consider, the vast array of TedTalks, Khan Academy, and dozens of other MOOCs (massive online open courses). I don&#39;t think this company is offering anything uniquely special or out-of-the-box, but rather monetizing on content that they prepare and package in their own brand...but essentially the content is free elsewhere! <br><br>But hey, for the avid learner, in the market for paid subscription to a catalog of courses...sure, the Great Courses is an option.

Iron is taken out of the earth, and copper is smelted from the ore. Man puts an end to darkness and searches out to the farthest limit the ore in gloom and deep darkness. He opens shafts in a valley away from where anyone lives; they are forgotten by travelers; they hang in the air, far away from mankind; they swing to and fro. As for the earth, out of it comes bread, but underneath it is turned up as by fire. Its stones are the place of sapphires, and it has dust of gold. \u201cThat path no bird of prey knows, and the falcon\u2019s eye has not seen it. The proud beasts have not trodden it; the lion has not passed over it. \u201cMan puts his hand to the flinty rock and overturns mountains by the roots. He cuts out channels in the rocks, and his eye sees every precious thing. He dams up the streams so that they do not trickle, and the thing that is hidden he brings out to light. \u201cBut where shall wisdom be found? And where is the place of understanding? Man does not know its worth, and it is not found in the land of the living. The deep says, \u2018It is not in me,\u2019 and the sea says, \u2018It is not with me.\u2019 It cannot be bought for gold, and silver cannot be weighed as its price. It cannot be valued in the gold of Ophir, in precious onyx or sapphire. Gold and glass cannot equal it, nor can it be exchanged for jewels of fine gold. No mention shall be made of coral or of crystal; the price of wisdom is above pearls. The topaz of Ethiopia cannot equal it, nor can it be valued in pure gold. \u201cFrom where, then, does wisdom come? And where is the place of understanding? It is hidden from the eyes of all living and concealed from the birds of the air. Abaddon and Death say, \u2018We have heard a rumor of it with our ears.\u2019 \u201cGod understands the way to it, and he knows its place. For he looks to the ends of the earth and sees everything under the heavens. When he gave to the wind its weight and apportioned the waters by measure, when he made a decree for the rain and a way for the lightning of the thunder, then he saw it and declared it; he established it, and searched it out. And he said to man, \u2018Behold, the fear of the Lord, that is wisdom, and to turn away from evil is understanding.\u2019\u201d\u201d<br>\u202d\u202dJob\u202c \u202d28:1-28\u202c", "comment_date": "2016-12-21T18:05:09Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Christian Simpson Music", "comment_text": "That was a lot of fun!

I could not get myself to do the free trial. My reason? I need to input billing information to do so. I have expendable income but not much of it. Naturally, I was happy to take advantage of a free month of learning during the holiday season. However, Great Courses wants me to input my billing info to do so. <br><br>I know you might say &quot;Oh just do it and cancel it immediately so youre not billed&quot;, great, but I read the fine print on the sign up page, it says that during the trial period, if you cancel, your services end. Basically they are only willing to give me this trial so long as they have my billing info. They&#39;re betting on me forgetting to cancel and getting charged for a month. &quot;So set a reminder on your phone or something&quot; Why? It is clear to me they want to make that difficult for me, obviously I am not their target and they are not terribly excited about me using their services at all.<br><br>This is something I do not appreciate in a business. While I can spare 20 bucks easily, I will not be sparing it to this company and I will not be doing the monthly trial to make sure that I do not. I understand they have to make money and theyre particularly interested in giving these trials to people who will actually consider staying subscribed, but where I come from, a free trial doesn&#39;t require a form of payment. <br><br>I will say this for any Great Courses representatives, the only thing that will cause me to remember your service a few years down the road is me getting a free trial right now. So, in my opinion, that was a stupid move on your part. I will forget your service, had you given me the trial regardless, this would probably not have been the case. Plus, I definitely won&#39;t be bringing you up in any conversations because you&#39;ve given me nothing to talk about. If youre scared of not making money off of me, what could possibly be the harm in giving me the trial?
