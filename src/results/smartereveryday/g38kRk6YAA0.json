I personally believe that to this day, the people I looked at the most as a starting guitarist have helped shape the way I play. From my improvised style I believe it comes from Stevie Ray Vaughn, BB King, Muddy Waters, and different aspect of Jimi Hendrix. My written down music is more of Estas Tonne, Morf, Tash Sultana, and Kaki King.

I suppose its because, when I started doing it I didnt have a clue how to do these things, but now I&#39;m smarter.. I&#39;ve learned how to do things.. I&#39;m still not full bottle on some things, so I YouTube the things I need to learn and add that to the list of stuff I can do for myself.. I&#39;ve learned more by watching YouTube videos than I have by asking others or reading a book, then put it into practice and learned by failures and successes. Make a mistake, fix the mistake, make it better every time.. That goes for everything I suppose..

Looking at pictures on Google Images, it seems to always curl toward the right side of the bullet. With the face of the card towards the camera: if shot from the left it curls towards the camera, and if shot from the right it curls away. Looking at a picture of the rifling it seems to be a clockwise rotation. I&#39;m still curious as to why both top and bottom halves curve in the same direction. The top might be intuitive as being &#39;pushed&#39; to the right of the bullet&#39;s axis but if that were the case, the bottom having the same forces should curl in the opposite direction. Maybe it&#39;s due to a factor such as where the tip of the bullet is or the difference between the shear strength in the two different layers of the card?", "comment_date": "2018-05-28T04:03:57Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Robert Craighead", "comment_text": "Who manufactures Casper mattress?", "comment_date": "2018-05-28T03:29:34Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Nicole B", "comment_text": "Nice video", "comment_date": "2018-05-28T03:27:59Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Mac Pratt", "comment_text": "Destin can I just spend a day with you.

Why the peak of the wave isn&#39;t in front of the tip of the bullet but much lower? I would like to know the answer. Secondly, do you plan to create more videos about aviation?

It was a 2D visual, and I hard-coded some numbers, and spent long hours chasing down computer crashing errors, but it finally worked! And it was mine. And I did it.
