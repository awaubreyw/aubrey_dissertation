No cameras, just rocket geek chat.&quot; <br>A few months later he changed a flight one day so we could grab lunch, but he also carved out a couple of hours before lunch to give me a personal tour.  <br>He&#39;s as cool off camera as he is on camera.  He allowed me to ask any technical question I had, and I never even got close to the limits of his understanding of rockets.  His technical prowess is something I aspire to. We made a video on the second channel where I interview him about more specific things about rockets, as well as how he feels about competitors. <br>2nd Channel Interview with Tory about rocket engines, competitors, and business philosophy: <a href=\"https://youtu.be/DQaPOIQLEUo\">https://youtu.be/DQaPOIQLEUo</a>", "comment_date": "2020-02-29T19:44:28Z", "likes_count": 4812}, {"comment_by": "Dipika04", "comment_text": "Hard work \ud83d\udcaa\ud83d\udcaa\ud83d\udcaa\ud83d\udcaa", "comment_date": "2022-09-03T05:14:51Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "pr0xZen", "comment_text": "Later that day, arguing with the security guard at the gate, screening you and your 250-ft trailer before you can leave: <i>Nah, nah man it&#39;s cool!

Why beg the Russians for their stronger rocket than our Gemini Titan? The Apollo F-1 remains the strongest rocket ever! F-1 the only 100% reliable rocket ever! 65 engines, 13 flights, zero F-1 failures! To the moon with five F-1 not 39 raptors, and no risky refueling in orbit! NASA planned the F-1 to take us to Mars by 1985, why didn&#39;t we use it? Why not now? With 39 F-1 we could do far MORE than Musk&#39;s Starship! Why did we waste 15 years waiting for the Shuttle rocket? A weak hydrogen burner needing solid fuel boosters. We could have launched Shuttle on 2 or 3 F-1. Why did we wait 60 years for Musk, Bezos and ULA to replace the Apollo F-1? We centrally use old &#39;60s Mercury, Gemini, we discard America&#39;s best, Apollo and use Russian Soyuz. And old late 60s Shuttle weak hydrogen rocket is now back on the new SLS to take us back to the moon - weak, so with solid fuel boosters. Why not use the tested and proved, 100% reliable F-1 that already took us to the moon? What is the hidden scandal of the F-1 that it&#39;s the only &#39;60s rocket we don&#39;t use? Our strongest, that took humans the farthest. The F-1 was plagued with explosions early on. Oscillations, but engineers found a way to make them &quot;self-correct&quot; almost magically! I wish we had that magical rocket for the last 60 years. And even today. We use the older Mercury and Gemini but quietly stop using the perfect record, best, strongest Apollo! Why? While we wait for Musk, Bezos and ULA with their less good rockets than 60 years ago! The F-1 became the most reliable, strongest rocket ever. Raptors have failed. F-1 never failed once going to the moon and is stronger! Is this the scandal Neal Armstrong meant in his moon landing anniversary, last speech: &quot;Things left undone,&quot; &quot;protected by truth&#39;s protective layers.&quot; Maybe the F-1 that powered the moon flights has some hidden scandal. What else could be left undone, protected by truth&#39;s protective layers? Going to the moon/Mars would be more urgent. If people thought no one had been there before. Do we want the real 1st people on the moon to be communist Chinese or invading brutish Russians? The race would be back on!", "comment_date": "2022-05-16T08:06:42Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Mike Sullivan", "comment_text": "We never went to the moon", "comment_date": "2022-05-16T06:15:25Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Marcus", "comment_text": "She has a great voice.", "comment_date": "2022-05-15T13:30:21Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Roger Schroeder", "comment_text": "If you want to keep it a secret, don&#39;t let a politician near the place.

The original Atlas rockets which predated Centaur were ICBM&#39;s and made by the same welded stainless steel process that is used on the current Centaur rockets. Basically, the rockets were flying gas tanks. The tanks were either kept pressurized or stretched in a special cradle that fastened to each end of the rocket to keep the  tanks from collapsing and there were special trailers that kept the tanks stretched while being transported to their destination. The machine that did the stainless steel seam welding was a modified spot welder that used an rolling electrode wheel to give a contiguous welded joint. Another interesting thing about the Atlas SLV was that there were 3 engines, the center that could gimbal for steering and the outer 2 engines that were jettisoned after the boost phase to lighten the load.", "comment_date": "2022-01-03T02:47:36Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "cobrasvt347", "comment_text": "Awesome.

We are so happy that our son has this opportunity and he loves it just like Mom:)!  Since he was little the two of us would jump into simulators and anything that pretended to take us to the stars:)!  When he went to work at ULA it was as much of a dream come true for me as him.  CEO Tony Bruno did a great job giving this tour:)!  I saved it and will definitely be watching this over and over:)!  I grew up when anything with Nasa/space took the front page for weeks and was the top news story.  My Dad and I talked about all of the advances being made and we dreamed the dream of space exploration.  My Dad is 87 now a Great, Grandfather so proud of his grandson and we now talk about all the latest rockets that are coming out. We talk about how they help our country/humanity and marvel that one of our family is involved in this fascinating and exciting world:)!!!  Family of rocket lovers here:)!!! Thank you ULA for being so COOL\ud83d\ude0e!!!! Raising up three more Grandsons, little rocket fellas:)!!! Sat and watched around six or more videos this afternoon of a Heavy, Atlas and others blasting off with two of the grandsons and they were literally jumping up and down watching them &quot;shoot into space&quot;!!! Made me so happy:). My son, his wife and two of the grandsons have been too Switzerland twice learning all there is to know and our son has met real astronauts:)!!!!!! Seriously, you find a more exciting job than this let me know. . .  I told my son if I was younger I would work in the broom closet:)!!!!  Words like rocket, orbital, burn, mega ton, boosters, helium, Mars, entry,  fairings, all of these and so, so many more are like chips for me, can&#39;t stop with just one:)!!!! Super video, thanks.

I worked at one of the OEMs in the 80s that was the first company to use solid propellant gas generators for PASSENGER airbags that were introduced in the 1989 Ford Continental.  There were many companies involved in the 1980s effort to put airbags in vehicles which turned out to be the technology that continues to this day.   Safety finally sold.  GM tried in the early 70s but they offered an optional system and dealer marketing support was abysmal and corporate was not much better.  This effort was lead by Ed Cole.  It was a one man show.  He didn\u2019t get much corporate support so the program died.  In the 10 off years a small group of engineers across town (as few as 2 in a bad sales year) kept looking at ways to enhance upon airbag design.  Previous suppliers were helpful but skeptical.  Eaton had made a big investment and got thrown under the bus.  They declined to participate. Many small rocket motor and speciality devices companies were interested.  Military and aerospace budgets were being cut.  I got to visit places that 10 years previous I could only see through binoculars.  I ended up with a design responsibility  for a component that could be made common  across many application.  It was an electro explosive device.  Where do I start?   I got a lot of help from many of the suppliers to the military and aerospace industry and used a modified existing design and my engineering spec was patterned after military specifications.  I would be asked, \u201chow do you know that the spec is good enough?\u201d.  My response,\u201d I used an existing spec developed for MAN RATED SYSTEMS  that would go into orbit and to the moon\u201d.  That seemed to be adequate.  It was a great experience.  I got to meet 2 scientists from the Franklin Research Center when it was in Philadelphia.  Their claim to fame was hardening the electronics against electro magnetic and radio frequency interference.  They had some wild tests done at White Sands Air Force base.  They would get a radar dish pointed at a vehicle equipped with special instruments and irradiate it with 100 watts/ meter squared which was considered the upper level of human tolerance at the time.  Measurements would show if any of that power got into the airbag wiring.  A little bit did but not enough to initiate or degrade the device.  Old engineers love to tell their war stories.

I&#39;d have watch every launch and would always be looking for ways to improve the design, materials and processes used to make the missions.<br>  That friction welding is quite impressive... it all is!<br>  Makes me want to build some more hobby rockets! And alter the designs a bit!<br>  There are so many things to think about when putting rockets together for specific purposes.... weight, strength, efficiency, stuctural integrity, properties of the metal and how that can change, weld strength and integrity, permeability of the metal, reactivity of metals, oxidation and so on. <br>   It&#39;s easy to see why the tolerances have to be so tight!<br>   This isn&#39;t exactly a homemade rocket made from a paper towel roll and balsa wood fins (although those are absolutely a LOT of fun and a great place to start!!!)<br>   Thank you SO much for sharing ULA!<br>I&#39;ll have to get some materials or some kits for the grandkids to make some more rockets! It&#39;s been a while since we&#39;ve done that! (Since my kids were young!)<br>  Every elementary, middle school and high school should have a rocket club!<br>  I&#39;m trying to remember where I&#39;ve heard Tory Bruno&#39;s name before!<br>  This video reminds me of the Apollo missions and the 1st trip where our astronauts set foot on the moon. I think everyone was holding their breath a lot, praying everything would go well. I remember we had people over, and we were out of school to watch the moon landing! We watched quite a few launces and landing back then. Watching the Space Shuttle program was incredible too! Exciting stuff! My aunt worked with the astronauts &amp; VIPs back then too!<br>   We&#39;ve come so far! Looking foreward to the trip to Mars with humans.<br>  What a great video! I love videos with intelligent people sharing smart ideas! TV would be SO much better if programming had shows like this 24/7!<br>  Thank you again for sharing! I hope to see more shows like this! With kids out of school, shows like this may help spark off ideas for taking ideas and exploration in space, under our oceans and here around sea level, to the next level!<br>  So very cool!", "comment_date": "2020-10-18T21:02:23Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "David VanderVliet", "comment_text": "<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o0fG_lnVhHw&amp;t=39m00s\">39:00</a><br>When the toilet paper rips\ud83d\ude02", "comment_date": "2020-10-18T20:47:12Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Perra J\u00f6nsson", "comment_text": "Really impressive and interesting manufacturing facility.", "comment_date": "2020-10-18T19:51:33Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Lee Dunavan", "comment_text": "This is super cool!

To start, im in no way an engineer or have any professional knowledge of any of this. Just a general interest in space and some of the general science behind it. So my question is, how does the 2nd stage (centaur if I remember correctly) with such a thin material withstand the stress of exiting earths gravity? I&#39;m familiar with the term max q being the maximum force that gets exerted on the rocket during flight. With that in mind I find it amazing a material that thin can withstand that. Im curious if it has to do with the fuel inside causing pressure against the material and having supports withing the shell causing outside pressure and structure. Or if there&#39;s pressurized another way? I&#39;m also curious how space affects all of this? Due to the vacuum.

Tory appears to be so calm concerning his responsibility of providing state-of-the-art rockets to meet the standards necessary to accomplish complex missions.

Talk about &quot;close-tolerances,&quot; my God...that alone is remarkable! Each stage of the fuel tanks to be combined with the power-plant section is flawless and built to withstand all the temperatures and pressures each rocket will encounter in flight. What is quite interesting is &quot;mating&quot; the aluminum panels with that type of welding, if you can call it that, stronger at the mating surfaces than the surrounding strength of the material itself. Add to that is mating it to the cargo stage, built of steel, and soon to be equipped for a human flight! Yet, in the center of this massive operation is Tory!

Is it the speed of sound thing? I assume the combustion process/propulsion is far in excess of the speed of sound, not to mention the speed of the rocket as well. This begs the question as the rocket breaks the sound barrier, does the flame propagation out the back actually fall below the speed of sound for a while anyway as the rocket enters the speed of sound transition point. Also, as the altitude increases, the speed of sound decreases. What kind of sound effects does this produce? Is there a sonic boom at the first transition from subsonic to sonic air speed (Mach I)? Or does the rocket make so much noise the boom is lost into the background? Obviously I have never witnessed a live rocket launch.

Destin has the education, experience, and passion to ask intelligent, appropriate questions and engage in meaningful conversation while simultaneously bubbling with the joy of a child in a rocket factory. And even though some of the things discussed go far over my head, it was still enjoyable the entire time.

One of the most interesting I&#39;ve ever watched. <br><br>Something that you might be able to relate to, now, is the fact that Tomahawk cruise missiles have no fuel tanks, and also (like Centaur) cannot support their own weight without support. The skin is between 0.0005&quot; thick &amp; 0.012&quot; thick (at the &quot;hard points&quot;). The entire body of the missile is the fuel tank, with the electronics immersed in the fuel. <br><br>When they fill it with fuel, they pressurize it &amp; seal it. It is, in essence, a thin steel (I believe) balloon. <br><br>For most of the body of the missile (the thin sections), the walls are so thin that they cannot support any differential stress across its thickness. One demonstration that used to be given to VIPs was to have the pressurized body of (I assume a rejected part) in what looked like a hand ball court, which had a bunch of netting hanging from the ceiling. <br><br>They&#39;d give the VIP a hard hat, goggles &amp; a sledge hammer, &amp; invite him to hit the side of the missile as hard as he could (or dared). <br><br>The result was amazing. The sledge hit the side, which collapsed just like a balloon would. Then the side (&amp; hammer) rebounded. The sledge hammer would end up in the netting above their heads. And the side of the missile would be <b>completely unmarked</b> by the hammer blow.<br><br>No stress across the thickness of the material, no strain, no residual deformation. <br><br>Cool.", "comment_date": "2020-03-04T21:28:58Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "SteveK", "comment_text": "What an awesome guy and complete gentleman..

These bodies in our sky are contained in the firmament.  The firmament is a barrier, or dome which is responsible for our atmospheric pressure.  No rocket has or ever will penetrate through this firmament.  This is where we observe the famous arc of all the rocket flight paths in every launch.  Thanks to NASA\u2019s decades long indoctrination of a fake space reality, we\u2019re all programmed to think of space as the heliocentric model of a spinning ball earth and other planets revolving around the sun in a galaxy, in an endless vacuum of space.  Space in the heliocentric model does not exist and is a false reality created by Hollywood\u2019s science fiction movies of Star Wars, Star Trek, etc, NASA is Hollywood but with a larger budget.  The heliocentric model is false and our reality is a flat plane that is stationary with the firmament above.  Up is up and down is down.  Space is cool but we have to reprogram our thinking to reject the false heliocentric model version of space and think in terms of space as what is contained inside the firmament.  Beyond or outside the firmament is where God\u2019s throne exists in the third heaven:  Biblical Cosmology.  I am yet to see any observable evidence of earth\u2019s curvature to prove NASA\u2019s version of a spinning globe.  I am yet to see a rocket launch (observing from the ground) traveling straight up and disappearing into the daytime or nighttime sky with no arc in its flight path.

For example car manufacturers don\u2019t know what exact conditions each car will face after it\u2019s out of the assembly line so they have to incorporate safety factors to try and deal with all those unknowns (ignorance). Also that\u2019s why cars built for very specific controlled purposes like F1 cars and the like have far tighter tolerances and less \u201csafety factors\u201d than a road car. Those cars are built for very specific conditions and only need enough safety factors to meet any regulations required and to be able to perform its duty correctly.<br><br>In the case of rockets, there\u2019s strict monitoring of every parameter leading up to a launch and after it.

In other words, can they not use a square/rectangle cutout for the older model because the smaller diameter and tighter curvature needed would result in an actual loss of strength if the square/rectangle cutout was used.", "comment_date": "2020-03-01T23:31:47Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Tony Grado", "comment_text": "Very very cool.

Had we staged our liquid propellant rocket and our solid propellant rocket we could have done much better than 4 miles. Rocket &quot;safety officer&quot; meaning Dad, did not permit us to go any higher. Not after the NY State police showed up after we launched one of our high powered amateur rockets out over Lake Ontario. Dad lost his nerve to push the envelope. The police were not wise to what we haddone as they responded to a citizen complaint that saw a fireball heading out over the lake moving at high speed and they also heard the rocket breaking the sound barrier as the thrust tapered off close to burnout. We were using spun fiberglass and spun carbon fiber tubing and graphite ceramic nozzles in 1969 long before carbon fiber was as common as today. A neighbor was an engineer for Spaulding Fibre in Western NY and we had bits and pieces tubing to our specs and tech data on their experimental tubing. Low carbon steel had been our material, much safer with composites than steel and easier to work with, pouring 2 part epoxy resins and inserting carbon/ceramic nozzles. Our liquid fuel rocket had a stainless steel un-cooled combustion chamber and nozzle and the tanks were made of aluminium and pressurized with dry ice. The oxidizer was nitric acid and the fuel was an 80/20 mix of turpentine and furfuryl alcohol. Static tested a couple of times to find minimum furfuryl that gave reliable ignition, flown once, the parachute failed. The Isp of about 240 seconds  only a little higher than our solid propellants about 220 seconds. Great fun, I did the math and design, my shop skilled buddy did the machining with the help of his shop teacher. Great fun ... learned a lot. Neighbor on one side of us worked for the fibre company and on the other side of my parents house another engineer for Bell Aerospace and assigned to the RM-81 Agena  B in the 1960&#39;s. I had plenty of expert help, learned how to do stress / strain calculations along with Algebra 2 and Trig for the NY Reagents exam. If anything school math was neglected during a wild construction project. I still crammed and passed the reagents at the end of the school year.

It would have been Cool if you had engaged the last guy applying the protective adhesive to the rocket and asked what he was doing and how what he was doing affected the project.  Just to bring it all back down to us little people doing the grunt work, and taking pride in what we do well.

But those of us involved in designing a rocket factory went with those marching orders. It became apparent that we had over capacity early on.\u00a0<br>So at Boeing we reconfigured the factory to also build Delta IV upper stages and payload fairings. Then we transitioned Delta II production from Pueblo, Colorado to Decatur. When ULA was formed the decision was made to also move Atlas V production to Decatur.

I interact with Tory much more now on Twitter as a retiree than I ever did as an employee. However I did work with Shannon on Commercial Crew.
