As a mod I\u2019m pretty chill, I\u2019ve only ever had to remove one or two posts from my sub. Reddit needs to be clear that mods are not gods, but they also know their community best and should have the freedom to make rules that help grow the community rather than making it an exclusive club where only a handful of people can actually do stuff. For example, r/showerthoughts has a karma requirement to post. Yet they never specify how much karma you need and they tell you not to email the mods to ask. Things like this are examples of petty mods trying to control their community in ways that prevent it from thriving. All subreddit settings (at least ones that limit users) should be freely available to all redditors to see for that particular sub. Recently I got banned for making a post that contained misinformation on the Covid vaccine subreddit even though I was actually explaining why the vaccines are safe. This is incredibly frustrating, and it feels like mods can get away with just about whatever they want while the community suffers in the process. No wonder Reddit has issues, they have no proper rules to make sure mods are treating their members in a fair and transparent way. This isn\u2019t a huge request, just make sure mods aren\u2019t abusing their power and make settings automatically published for everyone to see.", "comment_date": "2021-12-27T19:16:12Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Foster Family & Faith", "comment_text": "Jackass.

Since Reddit comments are a tree structure your intervention either has to be high up on the tree and very early in the fork to have much of an effect, or if time has passed you would be better suited replying further down the tree towards comments that have been more recently active but then you have severely reduced your potential audience.<br>Timeliness is a huge factor on Reddit to get the initial upvotes needed to have a comment stand above others and be readily visible to the viewers,  the interjection by Trolls is somewhat randomly targeted on posts that they expect will have a large following but they ultimately lose nothing for taking a small shot and missing.   The response to this you suggest involves first identifying where these interjections have occurred and then trying to mitigate the effects but to recognize where the interjections have occurred they will necessarily have been heavily viewed and voted on already making your potential audience at that point much smaller than the Trolls.<br>I think a very important aspect of what your&#39;e suggesting is that its not enough to recognize bad actors/trolls/disinformation  we all have to actively combat it and we have to do so in a way that reintroduces nuance and skepticism.

This is because most news websites include FB scripts, either in the form of FM Comments, or share buttons, or simply just tracking marketing performance (sending event data).<br>These scripts are hosted on FB domains which means your browser will use the FB Cookie when making the requests, so if you&#39;re logged in to FB from that same browser at some point in time, FB will connect that news website to your FB identity!<br>And that&#39;s not just websites, on apps there is a similar thing but slightly harder. There are many apps that integrate with FB login or use the FB Marketing SDK. A similar thing happens here but instead of cookies it&#39;s the phone&#39;s advertising id (Google Play Store Ad ID, or IDFA on iOS), now these can be turned off, but I&#39;m sure the SDK would fallback to generating it&#39;s own id using device fingerprinting techniques (you&#39;d be surprised how effective that is!). I believe the fingerprint would be consistent across apps, so if you ever logged in to FB app from the same phone, then the app (and all events it send off to FB) are associated to your FB identity.<br><br>It&#39;s terrifying, but that&#39;s what you learn when you try to use FB&#39;s tools to do performance marketing and targeting your ads to the people most likely to click (or to even to pay for something in your app).", "comment_date": "2020-03-28T16:01:54Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Scott MacLean", "comment_text": "Speaking as a moderator, one report, once investigated can lead to the removal of a LOT of other posts.

This is NOT just board moderators moderating their own boards, this is super admins stepping in and overriding the community preference of that board. The problem here is that A and B want to talk about topic X freely. But person C basically wants that free discussion shut down and so intervenes. And the mechanism for removal is really broad and badly defined content policies on what is and isn&#39;t allowed, most notably things like how hate speech is defined which ends up being basically anything you don&#39;t agree with.

Another way would be to ask for more understanding of everyones viewpoints, but that would just fuel Identity Attacks. A tutorial on how to respectfully and de-escelatingly converse about unlawful combattants for example would be really great. It would complete the series in my opinion. Avoiding such polarising topics would leave them to angry people who feed the trolls and we might even miss out on a chance to widen our horizons through difficult topics like these.

How far away do you have to be for there to be a change in earth? 10 light years? 100,000 light years? Is there a way to test it on a smaller scale? If you\u2019re travelling behind a car and the car flips, will someone 5 kilometres away see the flip at EXACLTY the same time? Do these things have anything to do with the speed of light? So maybe questions.

This isn&#39;t scientific at all. Nearly everything in this video labeled as &quot;troll&quot; behavior could be explained away as political disagreement. That&#39;s the main issue with anyone taking any kind of action or labeling these effects as &quot;trolls&quot; or &quot;Russian bots.&quot; There was a meme for the past few years where more conservative and centrist people who don&#39;t immediately dismiss everything the POTUS says as horrible or racist were accused of being bots, and so they&#39;d pretend to be bots just to point out how absurd it was. Why did this blow up? Because many of them would actually get banned widely on Reddit, on Twitter, on Facebook, etc just for posting an innocuous political opinion. If someone says something that makes you feel &quot;riled up&quot; as the Reddit woman said, that is not evidence that they&#39;re a troll or a bot. It may just be someone who disagrees with you who posts a correction, or tries to start a conversation. If your response is a personal insult, or to ban that person from your community, it is instead <b>those actions</b> that are causing harm, and so the important thing is to point that out: don&#39;t do that. If you don&#39;t want to have a political debate on the internet, feel free to ignore the comment and move along. If you do, don&#39;t call the person a &quot;cuck&quot; or a &quot;russian bot&quot; or a &quot;racist&quot; or whatever else you&#39;re going to do. I help moderate a political Discord server. We almost never have to ban anyone, and people can have wildly differing and conflicting political opinions yet have casual conversations every day without getting angry at one another. This is what Reddit, Twitter, etc should be striving for, not just banning the &quot;other&quot;.<br><br><br>You might think I&#39;m being a little hyperbolic with this response, but I don&#39;t think I am. Let me point out the same thing that Tim Pool has reported on, and even told Twitter, and many others have noticed: the &quot;content policy&quot; for many of these social media websites is inherently politically biased. This makes a specific political viewpoint &quot;acceptable&quot; which gives the platform&#39;s administration justification to remove content that they disagree with politically, not only because it&#39;s seriously objectionable. So the figures you show in this video are certainly being impacted by this fact. For instance, on Reddit alone, admins have encouraged subreddits to ban anyone with a post history involving any subs that are in favor of Donald Trump. They&#39;ve also taken actions against those accounts, including making them ineligible for moderator positions, in addition to suppressing this content from ever potentially reaching the front page. I don&#39;t like Trump, but this is a disgusting abuse of power. I&#39;m less concerned about 40 Russian troll accounts that Reddit banned and told us about and more concerned about platforms placing explicit political bias into their content policies as a justification to censor political opinion and controlling popular discussion by quarantining things for political reasons. If you thought the risk with Russia or any other foreign actor doing this kind of stuff was influence on public opinion, you have to understand that the platforms themselves operating on this scale of censorship is going to have orders of magnitude more influence. It&#39;s not acceptable for Russian trolls to mess with public opinion, so why should we allow the likes of Reddit, Twitter, Google, etc to do it?", "comment_date": "2020-03-26T00:18:01Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "GamingJose", "comment_text": "iFunny gang", "comment_date": "2020-03-26T00:17:11Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Moshca", "comment_text": "reddit... :/", "comment_date": "2020-03-26T00:16:45Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Michael J.", "comment_text": "Looks like Hagrid lost his job to the virus too.  ...had to move into his mom&#39;s basement.", "comment_date": "2020-03-26T00:16:16Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "mer meh", "comment_text": "Oh so everyone who disagrees with you is a Russian robot troll account?

Granted I heard 4chan is worse. I&#39;ve been on Reddit for four years and I don&#39;t use it every day really. Despite anyone being welcome on it, the majority of users lean left to heavily left. A good example of this is if you go to /politics and post anything from a republican view (even if said view is factual and correct), you get downvoted into oblivion. And the mods don&#39;t seem to care. And sadly politics really ends up spreading over into other big subs like /pics or /videos. <br><br>Now lets put politics aside and look at more fun parts of reddit like /mildlyinteresting. It&#39;s a fun sub with a ton of people. But the mods tend to be really harsh and ban people easily for no real reason. Then expect a ton of work if you want to be unbanned. And in some subs mods can ban you just simply because they want to. No real reason. And Reddit has no way for you to do anything about it. There really needs to be some sort of higher tier mods that can look at any complaints about a sub or its mods and take some action. All to often I&#39;ve seen people say they won&#39;t post in certain places, such as mildly interesting, because of this. <br><br>Then you have the karma problem. Karma to me sounds good in theory, but just gets abused to much. Best example? /UnpopularOpinion. Usually, popular opinions get lots of karma and awards even. And yet actual unpopular opinions get negative karma. And again, its a place where mods don&#39;t really care that popular stuff gets upvoted and unpopular stuff gets downvoted. Thus defeating the purpose of the sub.<br><br>There is also the issue of karma farming. Despite people not like resposts, you will see the same picture or video you seen an hour earlier. It to will have a ton of karma since it was posted on another sub. You may see the same picture or video ten times in a week and its annoying. And in these cases, some subs mods don&#39;t care if its a repost. Even though their rules say no reposts. <br><br>If you noticed there are popular times to post since its when the most people are on, hence you can get the best opportunity for karma. Doesn&#39;t that tell you karma is an issue? True, karma mostly really doesn&#39;t do anything for you or anyone else. But fact remains its an annoying feature. <br><br>And of course no matter the sub you like, there are to many toxic people who will say &quot;REPOST!&quot;. It can be a picture/video...etc you yourself have never seen before. But if just one person has seen it they report it to the mods. And yes, there is search function, but since titles can be anything, it doesn&#39;t mean you will find what you were going to post originally. <br><br>In the end I only really use Reddit for some funner subs. If Reddit got rid of karma I think it would be better off.

Recently the admins have been banning all sorts of subreddits for any content they dont personally agree with. Many subbreddits are banned for \u201chate speech\u201d, but no definition of \u201chate speech\u201d even exists and thus many subreddits that do not actually promote hate speech get banned. Also, admins have gone as far as remove all the mods from subreddits and then ban the sub for not having moderators, just to give a reason to ban it. Many examples exist, and a while ago r/WatchRedditDie was created to track this censorship and banning. But 2 days ago, even this subreddit was basically locked. Recently, it got even worse when Reddit implemented a policy where if you upvote a post that the admins consider \u201chate\u201d, YOU can get banned. Not only are you not allowed to post many types of content, but now you cant upvote it. Reddits political activity is over the top as well. Conservative/right opinions are censored across the board as many of the banned subreddits were right leaning. Personally Im extremely apolitical but regardless, its sad to see them censoring people just because of their political opinions.

Watching a commentary video about a week ago, the comment section was full of accusations that YouTube was &quot;bleeping out&quot; and censoring the audio of that video. The video would normally have been recorded in a production studio, but because of the virus and community lock-downs, it was being &quot;transmitted&quot; via a VPN from the commentator&#39;s home to the studio. Anyone that has watched Netflix during peak hours or on a slow network could have recognized that the holes in the audio and occasional skipped video frame was caused by a slow or high traffic connection. I gave this exact explanation, refuting the fact that YouTube had anything to do with the glitchy audio and pointed out that YouTube does not &quot;edit&quot; or censor bits and pieces of any one video, but instead takes down entire videos for what ever reasons. When all the comments accusing YouTube of censorship were getting large numbers of &quot;thumbs-ups&quot; and comments in agreement, I had a string of angry response comments, and an even larger number of &quot;dislikes&quot;. I <b>wasn&#39;t</b> defending YouTube, just pointing out the technical difficulties for that particular video.
