[{"comment_by": "SmarterEveryDay", "comment_text": "I hope you enjoy this video.  My thought was to not make a &quot;YouTube video&quot; style video.... but to make something I would be proud of for years to come.  About a year ago I was presented with an opportunity to go to a sea turtle conservation center in Costa Rica.  There I met Valerie, an amazing conservation researcher who has a true passion for sea turtles.  When I returned home I contacted Dr. Christine Finniger who taught me more.  When the Cook Museum told me about their amazing opportunity with Kale the endangered Kemp&#39;s Ridley sea turtle, I was totally floored.  I hope you enjoy this video as much as I enjoyed the experience.<br><br>Also, this is the first time DJI has sponsored Smarter Every Day.  The Mavic Mini is going to be a great tool for upcoming videos.  I&#39;ve already shot a couple of things for upcoming videos with it. If you&#39;d like to signal to them that you&#39;re glad they&#39;ve decided to sponsor Smarter Every Day it would be awesome if you&#39;d consider going here: \u2192<a href=\"https://bit.ly/3ePEAjS\">https://bit.ly/3ePEAjS</a> \u2190 and use promo code KLDE2Q87JZU9<br>to get 5% off when purchasing the DJI Mavic Mini or Mavic Mini Fly More Combo.  They didn&#39;t tell me to put this in the comment section.  I legitimately like the product and think you will too!<br><br>As always, thanks for watching and supporting my efforts to learn all kinds of interesting things.  I&#39;m grateful for you.<br>Regards,<br>Destin", "comment_date": "2020-07-13T23:51:08Z", "likes_count": 2741}, {"comment_by": "Donnie Williams", "comment_text": "Curious if Kale is still alive and well at the Cook Museum?

It was VERY well put together and sure educational! <br>The one reason why I started my search on sea turtles a while ago WAS because I came across the dr with the sea turtle with the straw in his nose. I\u2019ve always wondered what happened to them since and I\u2019m glad to hear that they were spotted doing well 2 yrs later! I was also rooting for that baby sea turtle at the start line and it brought tears to my eyes to see them finally get up and flop away! This video had me laughing, crying and I awe the whole time and even when I had to pause it to carry on with my day, it left me wondering how it was going to end because it sucked me in that much! On top of this being one of my favorite topics, you have a way of sucking the audience in and idk what your other videos are like, but I hope they\u2019re all as good as this one because you nailed it! It looks like A LOT of work went into it all especially with all that traveling to make it happen! Thank you for that and showing more of the behind the scenes of all the hard work that goes into saving all of these precious creatures!! And a HUGE thank you to all of those who do the work they do because it definitely makes a difference even if it saves only a few of them here and there! It\u2019s nice to see how everyone really is rooting for these animals and definitely has me contemplating also doing the same as a career because even though I\u2019m sure it\u2019s not easy work, it definitely looks like it has so many rewards and I\u2019ve never been so emotional over just watching the same topic all on video (except for when I initially did see that straw sea turtle video-that one definitely was the one that first pulled me in!!), I couldn\u2019t imagine actually doing this hands on and how wonderful that would be!!

Do you know why Valerie and her team release them when they have just hatched?

Not just sea turtles but also land (tortoise) and fresh water turtles (terrapin). They are an amazing type of reptiles. It is nice to see how nice sea turles are. Fresh water turtles are not that friendy, I have two of them. Especially my red eared slider female can ben quite aggressive, and you do not want to get bitten!  Sea turtles are a lot nicer in behavior compared to fresh water turtles. Altough the male terrapin i have has a nice behaviour, he is a cross between a red eared slider and a Yellow-bellied slider.But in general they eat everything they can capture, you do not want them to be the size of a sea turtle. :)<br>Great video. Turtles are amazing animals. And they have been for 220 million years. And I am sure they will be for a log long time. They have been gone trough mass extinctions. Survived the Dinosaurs, the ice ages, everything. Turtles are survivors!<br>It is interesting to see sea turtles are not aggressive at all, despite the fact that they can do a lot of damage with their beak if they want to.<br>If you like sea turtles you might want to look at land and fresh water turtles too (terrapins and tortoises).", "comment_date": "2020-10-04T01:08:53Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Bill Bayless", "comment_text": "Where you at?

We hadn&#39;t seen any for the whole trip, and this was just a last try sort of thing. We were walking along the beach for a few minutes, and then - a few feet in front of me I saw a little baby turtle sliding his way towards the ocean. We went up the beach, found the nest, and tried to be as careful as we could to not harm their journey to the ocean, while still protecting them until they hit the surf. It was amazing.

You video touched on many aspects of sea turtles and there is plenty more fascinating things about them to discover. Thanks for educating the public on what they should (and shouldn&#39;t) do around sea turtles. The use of circle hooks while fishing and covering up holes (ie. sandcastles, etc.) on the beaches where sea turtle hatchlings can fall into are two other things we can all do to help the plight of sea turtles.

One trip included some boating, I believe somewhere off of Yucatan. We came upon a very large pen built in the ocean for collection of massive adult sea turtles. The 4 of us kids jumped out of the boat, swam over and climbed into the pen. I mounted a turtle, like one would mount a horse, and secured myself using my hands on the edge of the turtle&#39;s shell at its neck. It took me for a ride I will never forget.

One year when we were staying one the beach in the Florida gulf near where some sea turtles had laid eggs. One day when my dad was walking about 10 yds from the marked area one of the sea turtle conservation people yelled at him and threatened to have him fined for attempting to disturb a sea turtle nest. Late in the week we were lucky enough to be there when one of the nests was hatching. I was watching it while my cousins (7 and 9 at the time) and they decided to take pictures with their parents phones, without realizing it they had the flash on (which I guess can disorientate the turtles) the same woman that yelled at my dad came up to my cousins and started yelling at them and cussing them out. I stepped in, toile the phones and apologized to her, she wasn\u2019t having any of it and stared cussing me out (I was like 13 at the time), she ended up calling the local game warden trying to press charges against me and my cousins, luckily there were several independent witnesses around that backed me up about how crazy she was being so the game warden was just kind of annoyed by the woman wasting his time. Some of the witnesses called the local office of the  international national organization she was associated with that night to complain and my parents and aunt/uncle did the same thing the next day. The people basically told us that they didn\u2019t believe the woman had done anything wrong, even after she told us exactly what happened (i.e the woman told the truth about what happened when she reported back to her bosses) and said they may file federal charges against me and my cousins. We then emailed the international headquarters of the organization and they basically told us the same thing. After that my cousins didn\u2019t go back down to the beach for the rest of the week and they\u2019re still not interested in going to the beach 6 years later.", "comment_date": "2020-07-14T14:02:02Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Shaun Murphy", "comment_text": "Michael Reeves wants to know your location", "comment_date": "2020-07-14T14:01:36Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Jamie Hutchinson", "comment_text": "Owh watching that straw being pulled out of the turtles nose was hard to watch D: poor thing", "comment_date": "2020-07-14T14:01:24Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "eldrich john reginaldo", "comment_text": "Everyone: loves sea turtle<br>Micheal Reeves: HAHAHAHAHA STRAW GO TO TURTLE BRRRR", "comment_date": "2020-07-14T13:59:47Z", "likes_count": 14}, {"comment_by": "AspectHistory - Mythology & History", "comment_text": "This is a wonderful video.

Frequent treatments of the fistula may have desensitized Kale to that position, or maybe created a survival instinct within Kale that associated that position with positive outcomes.<br>3. Lying flat to the bottom with no water buoyancy could be an irritant to the fistula or internal scar tissue and that position could take pressure off the injury.<br>4. The forces from acceleration and deceleration of the vehicle might be reminiscent of waves and it might prefer aligning its anteroposterior(?) axis accordingly. A 90\u00b0 turn of the bucket could test this theory. <br><br>Destin, thank you.

Since I went in 2013 and 2014, that part of Mexico has been classified as unsafe to travel and with that, the annual Turtle Trips have been cancelled. Normally, biology interested students will go out for 10-15 days a year in September and volunteer their time to work with a turtle biologist in the field. I was lucky enough to go twice, and students worked their butts off for years to save enough money to go on this trip. What an amazing experience this was and it inspired me to get my marine biology degree. My question is, do you know if this biologist (or any others for that matter) do work like that or if they may be interested? Is there a place I can find contact information for the researchers in Costa Rica? Thank you so much for posting this content.

We typically run hard out to about the 70 mile mark, and from there slow down a bit while we are getting rods and gear ready, and start looking for weed lines, birds, etc.  I just happen to be sitting on the edge of the gunnel looking into the water when I see a patch of seaweed about the size of a basketball. On top of its was a sea turtle about the size of a golf ball. We didn&#39;t disturb him, it looked like he was just resting, but was well alive and moving around.

A few times we vacationed when they were laying their eggs.. Actually happened across some researchers who were explaining what was going on and why and taking blood samples. The momma turtles basically go into a trance when they start their nest.. and are sensitive to white light, but less so to red light. At least two other times we were there when the eggs were hatching. Once at night - someone was standing in the surf with a huge coleman lantern because there was no moon - and once during the day. During the day, it must have been a dozen of us that protected the baby turtles from predators while they made their way to the water.. And after the first group I spend hours digging out the remainder of the next, freeing the little guys who couldn&#39;t make it on their own. To this day I like to think that just maybe one of the turtles I saved ended up making it.. ended up breeding.. just might be responsible for thousands and thousands of other turtles by now.
