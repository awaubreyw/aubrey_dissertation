After clearing the video for OPSEC, they did not limit my creativity in anyway whatsoever. I decided to make a video about the Command Structure on the submarine so we had a better foundation moving forward in the Submarine Deep Dive.  This video is just the beginning! I have some incredible things to show you as a part of the deep dive. Please consider subscribing for those. I&#39;m most grateful to people who go the extra mile and support Smarter Every Day on Patreon.  It&#39;s a super big deal because it brings stability to Smarter Every Day in ways that&#39;s hard to describe.  In this case, I had to buy a plane ticket to the Arctic on relatively short notice.

I served as a &quot;Steely-Eyed Missile Man&quot; aboard a Fleet Ballistic Missile (FBM) submarine back in the mid-70&#39;s. Our mission profile back then was significantly different from our brethren in the Attack boats - both ship types are very quiet and endeavor to stay hidden in our operating area but the FBM differs in that we were the larger strategic threat to our adversaries and we stayed on patrol for much longer duration. Also, the Fast Attack missions are more free-form and they have the flexibility (as the CO said) to execute them as the situation warrants. They also get to surface the boat from time to time when it is appropriate and to visit ports. FBM&#39;s don&#39;t surface unless they are told to or in the event of a potentially disastrous casualty situation. The FBM mission cycle when I served on them was 3 months on - 3 months off. But that aside, the particulars of crew structure, qualification requirements, comradery, and professionalism were exactly the same. FBM crew members get 2 patrols to become qualified - it is pretty rare for anyone to get their quals done in 1 patrol although I missed doing it by one signature since I was the Laundry Queen on my first patrol and therefore had plenty of opportunities to move about the boat and get signatures from watch-standers - plus there was the added factor of being the guy who was washing their skivvies - you want to take care of that guy right?<br>BTW:  The Chief&#39;s quarters are called the Goat Locker and the Captain was obviously given an open invitation to be in their space - I seriously doubt that anyone else on the boat has that sort of unrestricted access unless it might be the XO. The only thing you didn&#39;t focus on was the food - it&#39;s probably the best in the Navy. I look forward to seeing more of these videos.

It is nearly beyond comprehension what all these Navy personnel and their commanders have to deal with in such confined quarters, while on missions of incredible importance and no doubt danger. Complete love, and thanks to these brave men and women. For what it is worth you have my never ending respect and support! <br>THANKYOU, AND STAY SAFE!!", "comment_date": "2021-12-24T17:09:47Z", "likes_count": 2}, {"comment_by": "chris jimenez", "comment_text": "Captaians missing a finger tip, left hand hand middle finger", "comment_date": "2021-12-24T12:29:48Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Popboii 24", "comment_text": "Part of the captains finger is missing", "comment_date": "2021-12-24T06:26:24Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Alex Benavides", "comment_text": "It does make a sense to spend billions of dollars in technology to kill  people ?<br>We can help many people with these money .. and make a better world ..", "comment_date": "2021-12-23T22:45:49Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "The Honest Truth", "comment_text": "woww", "comment_date": "2021-12-23T14:54:08Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "PEOPLE=SHIT", "comment_text": "Imagine coming back to covid 19", "comment_date": "2021-12-23T08:00:08Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Arturo Wiemer", "comment_text": "I&#39;ve never seen something like this before.

Nope.<br>So I learned about the ideal gas law, which is quite intuitive: the pressure P at a valve of a gas cylinder gets higher as the temperature (T) and amount of gas (n) increase, but it gets lower if the volume (V) becomes larger. Add a constant to make the units balance out and you get: P = (nT/V) R, or as written on the T-shirt: PV/nR = T.<br>Gettin&#39; smarter every day.

Putting that aside, I can observe that the large number of current soldiers, airman and sailors, that buy and pay for their own watches, wear the good old Casio G shock.. 50 years ago you could see a Blancpain Fifty fatoms strapped to an arm of a French master diver. Today nobody would wear a 20 000$ Fifty fatoms while on a mission.

From my research, it depends on the class of the submarine, but it mostly follows this procedure. Submariners please correct me. Also, I am going to explain some somewhat basic naval stuff, please correct me if I&#39;m wrong.:<br><br>It starts with the officer of the deck informing everyone in the control room (including the captain) of the current status of the ship, water depth (including verifying it with a map), and the depth they intend to dive to. Anywhere they say &quot;stationary dive&quot;, it would normally just be &quot;dive&quot; but because they are surrounded by ice, they have to go under the ice before they can move. In this case, that was:<br>&quot; The ship is rigged for dive, with the exception of arctic full blow (ship status) and a sounding of 1490 fathoms beneath the ship (water depth, &quot;Sounding&quot; is how they measure depth), checks with chart at water depth (verifying the sounding depth). I intend to stationary dive the ship to 180 feet. (their intents).&quot;<br><br>The commanding officer of the sub responds &quot;very well officer of the deck, submerge the ship&quot;, saying that the information they have given was enough and giving the officer of the deck permission to carry out the plan he just announced.<br><br>The Officer of the Deck reads back that order &quot;submerge the ship, aye sir&quot;, and issues an order to the crew: <br>&quot;Dive. Stationary dive the ship to 180 feet&quot;.<br><br><br>The Diving Officer of the Watch (I think) repeats back that order &quot;stationary dive the ship to 180 feet, dive aye.&quot; and gives an order to the Chief of the Watch &quot;Chief of the watch, on the 1MC (the 1MC is the primary, ship-wide PA system) Stationary Dive, Stationary Dive&quot; Destin cut out the rest of this order which would be something along the lines of &quot;sound 2 blasts of dive alarm, Stationary Dive, Stationary Dive.&quot;<br><br>Then, the Chief of the watch would (I think) repeat back that order, then announce on the 1MC &quot;Stationary Dive, Stationary Dive&quot;, sound the dive alarm/claxon twice, then repeat &quot;Stationary Dive, Stationary Dive&quot;. The dive alarm is sounded 2x for diving and 3x for surfacing, and the same goes for the announcement (if they were surfacing it they would say &quot;surface, surface, surface&quot;)<br><br>At this point, the pilots set their control surfaces, and someone (depending on the class of the sub) presses buttons/flips switches to open the vents on the ballast tanks to flood them with seawater, and they announce &quot;all vents open&quot;, and someone (once again, depends on the class) verify that the vents are open on the periscope since that could be catastrophic if only one tank vents, because the sub could go to a bad angle, lose control, etc. As they do this, they announce &quot;venting forward/aft&quot; depending on which vent they are looking at.<br><br>According to unclassified navy manuals, if there is any confusion as to who could be responding to an order when they repeat it back, they append &quot;position, aye&quot;, so if it was an order for the pilot, they would append &quot;pilot, aye&quot;.<br><br>This procedure they run through is just mesmerizing to me as a teen.

My girlfriend saved my life last night. This is a selfie I took in the emergency room after having a severe allergic reaction to almonds. I went into anaphylaxis, meaning my face, my lips, my eyes, my tongue, and my throat all started swelling up rapidly, making it almost impossible for me to breathe. I also had a rash all over my entire body, and I was extremely red. Staying alive had never felt more difficult. At one point, my nasal passage was completely blocked, and it was getting more and more difficult to breathe. They shot me up with Benadryl, steroids, they gave me a breathing tube, and even other stuff that I can\u2019t even remember, and it caused all of the swelling and the rash to go away. Because this was a severe allergic reaction, I need to continue taking steroids and Benadryl for the next week, because it is possible that the allergic reactions could come back at any point over the next week. The steroids and Benadryl make me feel like a zombie, and I really want to take care of my health, so this will be my main focus over the next week. I want to thank my amazing girlfriend, who made the decision to take me to the emergency room the second I started feeling itchy. I was hesitant about going, because I didn\u2019t even want to believe this was actually happening. If it weren\u2019t for my girlfriend driving me to the emergency room only minutes after eating the almonds, there is a good chance that I wouldn\u2019t have made it according to the doctor. This has been without a doubt the hardest few days of my life, but I also look at them as the most important few days of my life. These moments have reminded me about what\u2019s really important in life, and it has made me so grateful to even be here on this earth. I will be prioritizing my health over the next week, and I\u2019ll post updates about how I feel. Thank you all for being patient during these difficult times.

Once the Second World War ended, he together with his closest collaborators and his family fled to Latin America. And among his closest collaborators just to mention some of them is Josef Mengele who was born in Gunzburg Germany on 03/16/1911 and died in Bertioga- Brazil on 02/07/1979 and was a German officer of the Schutzstaffel (SS) and doctor. And they fled to Latin America since she did not participate in the Second World War. Specifically Hitler and his family came to Brazil and then to VENEZUELA and some time later they settled or permanently lived in Argentina. The USA is the superpower that was the last to enter or participate in the Second World War and defeated or gave a sovereign or supreme beating to: Germany, Italy, Japan and the only casualty suffered by the USA was the attack on Pearl Harbor since It was a surprise military offensive carried out by the Imperial Japanese Navy against the United States naval base in Pearl Harbor on the morning of Sunday, December 7, 1941. As of August 6, 1945, it was the awakening of the modern or hybrid human being . Now, nothing that happens in this world is by mere chance, but by a cause-effect and we have to end the violence of racism, xenophobia, or discrimination in the world since in the 21st century it not only occurs in the USA, also in Chile, Bolivia, Colombia, Brazil where the interests of the \u201ccompulsive mythomaniac criminal demon narco-terrorist dictator of Nicolas Maduro Moros\u201d from VENEZUELA are affected; since he is the chicken of the golden huievos the main partner or provider of wealth, power or ill-gotten economic fortune and an accomplice of the &quot;antichrist = Delinquent, mentally ill of the 21st century who is Vladimir Vladimirovich Putin&quot; since the aforementioned criminal demon of VENEZUELA is recklessly or inordinately looting its wealth: &quot;gold, diamonds, coltan, uranium, thorium, platinum&quot;; and they are NOT selling it to Russia but to the aforementioned 21st century antichrist and owner of the Russian state oil company Rosneft and he was born in the 20th century and as a child he and his parents were poor and now after adulthood he is a social resentful and the most billionaire man of all time and with the power of the nuclear button in his hands since he has long-range or intercontinental missiles (ICBM) with a blade or nuclear warhead. When the fugitives of justice from Ecuador Rafael Vicente Correa Delgado and from Bolivia Juan Evo Morales Ayma, Luiz In\u00e1cio da Silva and Dilma Vana Rousseff from Brazil were presidents, Nestor and Cristina Elisabet Fern\u00e1ndez for Argentina there were no protests for racism or xenophobia in Those countries since the antichrist of the 21st century neither promoted it, neither promoted it nor financed it since they were the allies and accomplices of the also DECEASED demon narco-terrorist dictator Hugo Rafael Chavez cold \u201cballs\u201d of VENEZUELA. I do not know if they have realized that it is not by mere chance that currently in this year 2,020 neither in Mexico, nor in Nicaragua, nor in Argentina, nor in Cuba, there are no protests for racism, nor for xenophobia since their presidents and vice Presidents are allies of the aforementioned criminal demon of VENEZUELA. And the antichrist of the 21st century supports, defends and protects the delinquent demon of VENEZUELA who is his accomplice and partner or his little chicken that lays the golden eggs for his fortune or ill-gotten money. Nobody protests about the humiliation, mistreatment and hunger of the people of Cuba because of the dictatorship of the Castro, nobody protest about racism, xenophobia that exists in Saudi Arabia where they exploit the Indians or Indues (inhabitants of India) working for a miserable salary and without security conditions at more than 600 meters high when they build a skyscraper and if there were some protest is censored. And all this information I say or bring it up since unscrupulous or evil people take advantage to distract the attention of the international community as is the case of the narco terrorist dictator Nicolas Maduro Moros since he encourages, manipulates and finances violence, hatred, chaos and anarchy with black or African-American racism and xenophobia in the USA to avoid their capture and arrest on charges of drug trafficking, terrorism by the DEA, Interpol, UN blue helmets stationed in Brazil since 1945 and US military forces The following demons are also accomplices of the narco terrorist dictator Nicolas Maduro Moors and the antichrist of the 21st century: \u201cHasan Rohan\u00ed president and dictator of Iran, Xi Jinping since 2013 president of the People&#39;s Republic of China, the dictator of North Korea Kim Jong- one, the dictator of the failed island of Cuba, the dictator of Nicaragua, the fugitive former president of Ecuador Rafael Vicente Correa Delgado who according to information spends his time traveling incognita between Mexico and England \u201d, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus director general of the WHO who It was imposed by China at the UN, Argentine Communist Pope &quot;Francisco = Jorge Mario Bergoglio&quot;, among other devils-delinquent to mention. On the other hand, in Venezuela we currently live with people of white, black, indigenous, Venezuelans, foreigners: &quot;Italians, Spanish, North Americans, Germans, Chinese, Ecuadorians, Colombians to mention a few&quot; and all of us are being mistreated, they extort us, they humiliate us make pass hunger and die of decline or lack of medicine \u00absince since May 30, 2020 there is already a vaccine in Russia against covid-19 called&quot; Avifavir, Remdesivir, sputnik-5 &quot;and still in VENEZUELA they have NOT brought it and that We are an ally of Russia and China \u201d, our quality of life also deteriorates by more than 80% and I do not see any protest, vigil or demonstration worldwide as a result of that, consequently I ask myself: do we who currently live in VENEZUELA not have Importance for the rest of the world? And we Venezuelans who once the Second World War ended, we opened the door of VENEZUELA for all foreigners to enter and stay and form their families here. Consequently to all this I never tire of repeating that it is necessary to weaken economically or deteriorate their quality of life to the aforementioned antichrist of the 21st century by opening and blocking their anonymous bank accounts either in the banks of Switzerland, the Vatican, Cayman Island, etc; since definitively in the 21st century money is called &quot;dollar, euro, pound sterling, Brexit, German mark, etc&quot; means power or in order to obtain more power with the sole purpose of threatening or subduing humanity or the inhabitants of some country I specify with violence, terrorism, chaos, anarchy, &quot;pandemics = chemical warfare = battery warfare&quot;. If your anonymous bank accounts are blocked by the antichrist of the 21st century and his demons or allied partners, the antichrist of the 21st century is gradually weakening since the \u201cgold, coltan, diamonds, thorium, uranium, platinum\u201d that you buy in sales illegal or ill-gotten hold of in VENEZUELA he converts it into currency or money and also into real estate properties and by blocking the money that he already has deposited in his anonymous bank accounts, he will have to sell his real estate and that money or that exchange with those real estate properties must be avoided or blocked, thereby reducing their permanence in power until the year 2,036 with the power of the nuclear button in Russia. And also remember nothing in life is free and the antichrist of the 21st century is vigorous, powerful, conceited and rosy together with his family and his demons partners or accomplices and he is the main promoter, promoter and financier and by NOT having &quot;cash = money or assets such as real estate &quot;is weakened to continue with its malevolent:&quot; chaos, violence, anarchy, terrorism, &quot;covi-19 pandemics = biological warfare = battery warfare = chemical weapons&quot; in this world. By the way the &quot;covid-19 pandemic = chemical warfare = battery warfare = chemical weapons&quot; is only the beginning or beginning of a few &quot;pandemics = chemical wars = battery wars = chemical weapons&quot; that encourages, promotes, sponsors and finances the ya referred to &quot;antichrist = Mentally ill criminal of the 21st century&quot; and that are to come or be unleashed in the 21st century in the world. Do not forget that it was not by mistake or by mere coincidence the impact of an Iranian missile that blew up MALAYSIA Airlines Flight 370 MH370 / MAS370 on 03/08/2014. Since all its passengers were pure international scientists who were going to give a conference and news about the vaccine and cure of some cancer and AIDS &quot;as I affirm or confess on 06/16/2020 Donald John Trump President of the USA&quot; nd they were also going to warn of the possible &quot;pandemic = battery warfare = chemical warfare = chemical weapons&quot; such as that of covid-19. In the middle of the 21st century, not only will conventional, economic wars exist in this world \u201d, terrorism, chaos, anarchy, xenophobia, violence, but also\u201c pandemics = chemical warfare = battery warfare = chemical weapons such as that of covid-19 \u201dfostered, promoted and funded by the 21st century &quot;antichrist = mentally ill criminal&quot; and all his aforementioned henchmen. And the antichrist of the 21st century and all his allied or complicit demons are much more dangerous than the aforementioned 20th century antichrist and his allied or complicit demons of that time. In my country there are 2 proverbs or phrases that read like this: 1) Mona dances for money, 2) Tell me how much money you have and how much money I love you and I will help you. But nothing in life is impossible and even less in the 21st century and as God said &quot;Help me, I will help you but don&#39;t leave all your work to me.&quot;.", "comment_date": "2020-09-12T20:51:53Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "pedro goduto zambelli", "comment_text": "Hello: The antichrist (mentally ill) of the 20th century was the Jewish military political dictator of Germany Adolf Hitler who wanted to subdue humanity in complicity or with the help of demons: \u201cBenito Amilcare Andrea Mussolini- dictator of Italy and the Japanese Empire\u201d. And after the 2nd. World War Vladimir Vladimirovich Putin was born in the 20th century he was a child or poor infant and as an adult he is a social resentful since until the year 2036 he is the dictator of Russia and \u201cantichrist= Criminal-Mentally Ill\u201d of the 21st century and is the most billionaire man of this world, with the power of destruction of the nuclear button and creating anarchy, chaos, pandemics, violence or currently protests of racism among others. I am not a religious fanatic; But to prevent him from submitting to humanity, we must apply the corrective of ending once and for all with the secrecy of all anonymous bank accounts or without personal data of their owners that they do have active in the banks of SWITZERLAND, Island Cayman, VATICAN bank that can be immediately verified by any world security or police agency, call INTERPOL, DEA, SCOTLAND YARD, HaMishtara HaTzvait- ISRAEL among others, since they are breeding grounds for demon allies or helpers of the antichrist of the century 21 and these helper demons are: \u201cterrorist FARC, ELN, ISIS, jihadists, murderous dictator of Nicaragua, communist-Argentine POPE of the Catholic Church Francisco, WHO director Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, Chinese empire, Turkish empire, Iran empire, Cuba, dictator of North Korea, of the narco-terrorist dictator of VENEZUELA failed \u201d. In the specific case of the narco-terrorist demon dictator of VENEZUELA Nicolas Maduro Moros who has ill-gotten 5,000,000,000 dollars deposited in the Vatican bank not including the ill-gotten billions of dollars that they constantly deposit in his anonymous Swiss bank accounts and through millionaire economic resources that it exploits and extracts from Venezuela such as: &quot;Gold, diamonds, thorium, coltan, oil, uranium, aluminum, iron, etc&quot; a small part is sold to the previously named helper demons of the 21st century antichrist but really Most of those riches are sold primarily NOT to Russia but directly to the current 21st century antichrist and owner of the Russian state oil company Rosneft. And the antichrist of the 21st century and all his &quot;helper demons including Nicolas Maduro Moros- Venezuela&quot; have these anonymous bank accounts active and use them to harm or subdue the inhabitants of a specific country or in a general way to harm or submit to the humanity. In the world there were two (2) great events and there will be a third event, and these are: The 1st. Event: It was the birth of the human being called a caveman or caveman. The 2nd. Event: It was the disclosure as a state secret of the INTERNET since it is currently NOT only for military use but for the public domain, since the technical or scientific information between the sky, the earth and the bottom of the ocean with the INTERNET is nothing hidden . And the 3rd. Event is the disclosure to humanity that will be announced no later than or MAXIMUM in the year 2035 that we are not alone in this world and we are not the only intelligent beings in the universe; since there are aliens that live with us. Since the missing link of our ancestors between the clumsy and slow cavemen and the current hybrid or modern human being are the aliens. There will always be only wars: &quot;conventional as all those that occurred after August 6, 1945, also trade wars (such as the current USA-CHINA; among others)&quot;, there will also be unjust pandemics such as the current COVID-19 and other pandemics or viruses that will later come to this in order either to unjustly purify humanity of children and sick people and of the elderly or elderly population that are not productive and that represents a huge social expense of retirement or cure payments especially for the government of Russia since there is more old or elderly population living there than young population and also due to mishandling of batteries as the capitalist communist republic of CHINA did. Now, the current human being is a hybrid since aliens modified their DNA just 10,000 years ago. Hence, my theory comes that the current nuclear age that began on August 6, 1945 was the AWAKENING of the hybrid or modern human being, and since that date there have been more than 15 attempts at self-destruction wanting to unleash the 3rd. War or nuclear hecatomb but the aliens prevented it since the only and total losers would be: &quot;The whole of humanity, animal and plant life, and the aliens that live with us&quot; and that is why we must end several myths that seem Childish or stupid to think or continue to believe in them, and these are: 1) That the human being was created in the image and likeness of God since our DNA for about 10,000 years was modified by aliens, 2) That the dinosaurs They were extinguished by a huge meteorite or asteroid that hit the earth and the oil came or is the product of that extinction. What DOES really happen is that the aliens were modifying the DNA millions of years ago to each animal of each species of dinosaurs so that they could evolve with the human being in the current ecosystem. And scientifically or technically oil exists before the dinosaurs or since the planet earth was formed since at the level of the earth&#39;s surface it is called Oil in Rock or Crack and buried at high depths the oil is liquid or molten since the rock Oil crack due to the high temperature and pressure under the earth or at the bottom of the sea this becomes liquid or molten also as is the case of iron at the level of the earth&#39;s surface or in mountains and far from the core of the earth is in solid form iron, on the other hand, in the center of the iron-nickel earth is super liquid or molten and not solid due to the high temperatures and pressure that exist there creating the famous magnetic field that protects us from the gamma radiation and neutrons that come of space especially the sun. If we continue to believe that oil is the product of the extinction of the dinosaurs, then I ask, is it that all dinosaurs lived in Venezuela, Saudi Arabia and some OPEC countries, and the most exquisite or purebred dinosaurs lived perhaps only in the North Sea since the oil there is purer than the rest of the members of OPEC and VENEZUELA ? In our universe there are asteroids that contain iron, gold, diamonds, coltan, thorium, uranium, lead, bacteria; also petroleum in the form of rock or crack bound with other minerals such as calcium, lead, etc. Currently the largest oil reserves in rock or crack are held by the USA, whose technology to melt or exploit it was transferred or rented to the Republic of China since they have huge amounts of crack or oil in rock and this oil reserves in rock or crack of the USA surpass the liquid oil reserves that VENEZUELA and OPEC countries have. 3) That there is fresh water on the earth&#39;s surface and in no other part of this world and universe. Since there are huge reservoirs of fresh water below the earth&#39;s surface, as in several comets, planets and asteroids they are sources of frozen fresh water supply. 4) That man did not go, did not step on, or did not reach the moon, since on 07/15/1969 he did arrive and colonize the moon and at the end of the 1970s he arrived and colonized the planet Mars and currently dominates the anti gravity technology see plane TR-3 Black blanket. 5) By mistake of the impact of a missile, it exploded on 03/08/2014 to MALAYSIA Airlines flight 370 MH370 / MAS370. Since all its passengers were pure international scientists who were going to give a conference and news about the vaccine and cure of some cancer and AIDS &quot;as I affirm or confess on 06/16/2020 Donald John Trump President of the USA&quot; and also They were going to warn of the possible pandemic such as the covid-19. 6) That it was by chance that the asteroid that exploded in the airspace of Tunguska-Siberia-RUSSIA on 06/30/1908; What if it really happened is that the 10,000-year-old black knight extraterrestrial artifact that orbits between the earth and the international space station &quot;ISS&quot; fired a beam of energy to prevent further damage to planet earth, I don&#39;t know if you have noticed that no satellite, old space stations: &quot;Skylab-USA, MIR-RUSA&quot;, shuttle or private space rockets or missile approaches or orbit close to it. There is a trace recently discovered that in our ancestor with more than 5,000 years old before the Christian era in our world there were detonations of nuclear weapons products of advanced technologies of wars between extraterrestrials. Everything that happens in this world is for a cause-effect either for &quot;Human evolution, slavery, self-destruction&quot; and NOT by mere chance. And all the uncertainties, myths or legends: Who and why John Fitzgerald Kennedy was assassinated; how long did Adolf Hitler live and where did he die, What is big feet, The universe is limited in time and size, including those related to the Blessed Jesus of Nazareth from the time he was conceived in the womb of the Blessed Virgin Mary of Nazareth until his resuscitation will be answered or revealed with more precision by the extraterrestrials by being witnesses or direct participants from millions of years ago from the evolutionary facts of planet earth. It seems primitive or childish to me that in the middle of the 21st century in my beloved and beautiful Jerusalem-Israel, its pilgrims go to the wailing wall to insert or send written pieces of paper or hit their heads against the wall or speak to the wall and believing that God or the wall : &quot;He will answer: either in writing on the same or another paper, or spoken or by telepathy&quot;.

It may have been a bit disconcerting for you, but you handled it well.  As a former fast attack sailor (MM1/SS) qualified on a 688, this brought back a ton of memories (most of them good).  Some things that your video didn&#39;t mention, though it was sort of hinted at, sailors have to volunteer for submarine duty.  There is not a lot of down time for the new guy, between learning their job and qualification (both in their rate (job assignment), as well as submarine quals for their dolphins.  Those &quot;beds&quot; that you didn&#39;t get to see in birthing are typically shared, three sailors assigned to two racks (hot racking, look it up) because they work a rotating shift every day of the week at sea.  To answer one of the questions I saw on the comments, yes, some of the sailors are married, officers and enlisted, and yes, it can be tough, though as I understand it, things have gotten better than when I was in as far as communicating back home.  As a Navy vet, sailors are special to me, and submariners even more so.

It also makes sense that people in the military would respect scientists and engineers because those are the people who create devices that keep them safe and plan missions in a way that protects all the people involved. I know that it&#39;s a well-known fact that the media almost never portrays things accurately, but seeing this video made me realize how much of a shame it is that Hollywood creates this negative stereotype of people in the military and devalues what they do. Many of the people in the military are engineers, researchers, and experts in their field. Moreover, they are dedicated to their work and extremely hard working.

Superb discussions with both officers and crew.  My late father was a submarine medical officer in the early days of our nuke &quot;boats&quot; as they used to be lovingly called.

That said, while in the service I never stepped foot of a ship other than USS RECRUIT (at NTC, San Diego).  I got interested in Pacific War history in the mid-1950&#39;s while my family was living on Oahu.  I&#39;m still extremely interest in our Navy&#39;s role in World War II.  Some folks may be drawn to subs because of HazPay, but I suspect the vast majority of them go into subs because it is as &quot;tight&quot; a community as one will ever find either in the service or in civilian life.  I&#39;m 72.  I went into the Navy on 24 August 1970, and was honorably discharged out on 10 November 1971.  I dearly love the personnel of the United States Navy.

I could not have asked for a better bunch of shipmates, a few of which I still stay in touch with 34 years later.

You&#39;re right, butterflies do love it, hence its name. But many, many other insects are drawn to it as well. I see more bees in mine than butterflies, at times 20+ on a single plant. They are wonderful plants and can really increase the biodiversity of an area. They are very hardy and can even withstand huge aphid numbers, which in turn lures in ladybugs, the larvae of which are known as aphid lions.

It makes a lot of sense that submarines in the arctic would need to use one, even though I had never really thought about it. Basically the SVP checks what the local speed of sound is. Which is really important because you have an interaction between frozen fresh water and liquid salt water.

You are either being trained or training someone else. Think about the workplace you work at and imagine if every person who worked there changed jobs about every 3-4 years and someone new came in. I don\u2019t know about the statement that everyone loves their job, but I will say my experience was that overall they were a great group of guys (women weren\u2019t on subs when I was in) and I was always amazed how well we generally got along.

Second night at 2:45am: Dustin wakes up to the sound of a loud emergency alarm. Red light beacons rotate giving a clear image of an emergency. He can hear the crew speaking and giving commands loudly through the door. The first thing he does is dress up, put on protective gear, and turn on his camera to record. He comes out of his room and everybody is rushing to their computer seats and positions. He stays still for a moment not knowing what&#39;s really going on. Dustin, ready to take action and help in any way he can, approaches the crew to ask what is the emergency but they seem to not want to tell him because he could enter in panic giving the seriousness of the situation. After a few failed attempts to make the crew tell him about the situation, the Commanding Officer orders Dustin to go to (the safest place in the submarine). Dustin sees in the CO eyes that something is out of the ordinary so he wants to keep him safe, but at that moment... nobody was safe no more. As Dustin is turning back, an explosion occurs inside the sub and he is knocked unconscious. Everyone is disoriented at this point. After a few minutes, a crew member wakes Dustin up and yells &quot;Follow me!&quot;. Water is flooding the inside. They rush to an emergency exit pod and make it just in time. They were the last ones to exit but they don&#39;t know that and they hope everyone is ok. They can see from inside the pod&#39;s glass walls that the submarine is sinking and breaking apart as they get away from it. &quot;It was an enemy attack,&quot; the crew member said. and it is at this moment that Dustin realizes that his life would never be the same. <br><br>This is a survival game where Dustin must explore the Arctic for resources to survive, find the rest of the crew, and find out who was the attacker and why they did it (plot twist included). The crew member he scaped with will teach and help him survive and combat enemies and will become one the allies from the many he can choose from to help him as he progresses in the story. At the end of the game, Dustin has learned many skills and has accomplished many tasks and formed an alliance of military, civilian, and animal companions, built structures, and created a society.<br><br>best wishes to u bro", "comment_date": "2020-07-29T09:16:42Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Mike Debarbieris jr", "comment_text": "That&#39;s cool they have a picture of Sean Connery in the Hunt for Red October on the wall.", "comment_date": "2020-07-29T09:15:35Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Juan Castillo", "comment_text": "I did 8 years, got out as YN2(SS/DV), God bless America!", "comment_date": "2020-07-29T09:11:23Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Juan Castillo", "comment_text": "Any other silent killers here?", "comment_date": "2020-07-29T09:10:26Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Juan Castillo", "comment_text": "COB said \u201cI know\u201d lol", "comment_date": "2020-07-29T09:08:49Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Velasoraptor", "comment_text": "The only correction I can make to this video is when you introduced the &quot;medical officer&quot;.

I greatly appreciate the way you went about explaining the command structure, as well as the unique interpersonal dynamics. A few things about life on subs: 1.) It&#39;s called the &quot;Silent Service&quot; for a reason. Noises on submarines is the fastest way to reveal your position. &quot;Sound-shorts&quot;, e.g., a dropped wrench in the bilge area, can be detected for miles. 2.) The quality of the food is directly proportional to the attitude and morale of the crew. 3.) Flashlights in berthing areas = imminent pain and suffering. 4.) LEARN EVERYTHING...it could save not only your life, but everyone&#39;s.<br><br>May I suggest that these amazing people are only half of the equation. You may want to do a follow up segment...the families that are left back home for months at a time. It may not be the intellectual deep dive that you usually take on, but I promise you that you will discover the real power behind our submariners. The strength and tenacity of the spouses, and the emotional trials and tribulations that the family go through are worthy of some recognition.   <br>I can&#39;t wait to see the rest of this series. <br>God bless you in all that you do, and hey, don&#39;t forget to GetSmarterEveryDay!", "comment_date": "2020-07-29T03:12:21Z", "likes_count": 290}, {"comment_by": "W.A.

Your dosimetry goes by the name TLD, short for thermoluminescent dosimeter. The sailors wear them on their belts, I imagine you wore your TLD on your chest. They were right in that you receive more radiation on a flight then on a nuclear powered ship. The US navy has done a lot in lowering radiation exposure sailors receive while onboard a nuclear powered vessel. I would be interested to know, if the navy allows it, what radiation exposure you received while on board. Meaning, what did your TLD measure as your exposure. I bet it read 0.0. This is important because I don&#39;t believe the general public understands radiation exposure. I&#39;ve heard people joke and say something like, &quot;you&#39;ll turn green from that radiation,&quot; which is funny, but that might be the extent of the person&#39;s knowledge of radiation exposure.

Instead they flow perfectly with eachother, it&#39;s like a healthy mix of co-worker and friendship and it sounds like it allows them to really push eachother in healthy, as well as very productive ways.

My 13 year old son and i absolutely love science. My son is a low level special needs learner,and your videos have inspired a very bright spark in my sons ability to learn anything science. You have a way of making even the most complex science,seem tangible. Your visual skills and expert moderation have not only helped my son become more interested in science, but now he is asking more and more questions, he is finding answers on his own,he has an insane fascination with the atom and how all of it works, especially nuclear power. When he and i were exploring how a nuclear bomb works,he started to make more sense of fission and fusion, especially with multi-staged warheads. Then he asked about the possibility of nuclear fusion power,so we explored that idea. All in all i have to say that starting your videos at least over a year or two ago has ignited an enormous spark in my boy. His main learning issue is with reading and comprehension. The docs and counselors have no reasoning behind what they call a neuro-disconnect. He is not on any realm as far as autism or dyslexia he just has some issues with reading and understanding what he has read.  But with your videos,he has began to read more often especially if it is an interesting subject for him. So to make a long story short,i just want to thank you from the bottom of my heart for all of the hard work and effort you put into all of your videos. Your use of visual keys in conjunction with the available information to help the &quot;layman&quot; to understand complex science is by far soo phenomenal. My son has gone from dreading reading,to he cannot wait for the next book to arrive or he cannot wait sometimes to finish reading something that interests him. We cannot wait to see the whole line of videos about the nuclear submarine.

Kuntze\r<br>\r<br>Asclepias curassavica, commonly known as tropical milkweed,[3] is a flowering plant species of the milkweed genus, Asclepias.[4] It is native to the American tropics[5] and has a pantropical distribution as an introduced species. Other common names include bloodflower or blood flower,[3] cotton bush,[6] hierba de la cucaracha,[3] Mexican butterfly weed, redhead,[6] scarlet milkweed,[3] and wild ipecacuanha.[3]\r<br>\r<br>It is grown as an ornamental garden plant and as a food source for some butterflies, however it may be harmful to the migration patterns of monarch butterflies when used in gardens outside of its native tropical range.[7] Though public concern for the rapidly declining monarch population increased the demand and commercial availability of milkweed among nurseries in the USA, the results have been mixed. While tropical milkweed may effectively sustain monarch larvae, the perennial growth of the plant takes ill effect on the monarchs&#39; migratory patterns and may have other physiological effects.[8] Use of the tropical milkweed in gardens has disrupted monarch migrations notably in California, Texas, Florida, and South Carolina.[9] Unlike the milkweed species native to these locations, the tropical milkweed does not go dormant in the winter causing non-migratory groups of butterflies to form. Planting Asclepias curassavica in nonnative regions therefore remains controversial and criticized. Alternatively, native milkweed species are suggested for butterfly gardens.[10]\r<br>\r<br>It also attracts members of the Danainae subfamily, such as the queen.\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>Contents\r<br>1\tDescription\r<br>2\tCultivation\r<br>3\tDistribution\r<br>4\tChemistry\r<br>5\tGallery\r<br>6\tReferences\r<br>7\tExternal links\r<br>Description\r<br>Typical plants are evergreen perennial subshrubs that grow up to 1 m (3.3 ft) tall and have pale gray stems. The leaves are arranged oppositely on the stems and are lanceolate or oblong-lanceolate shaped ending in acuminate or acute tips. Like other members of the genus, the sap is milky. The flowers are in cymes with 10-20 flowers each. They have purple or red corollas and corona lobes that are yellow or orange. Flowering occurs nearly year-round.[5] The 5\u201310 cm (2.0\u20133.9 in) long, fusiform shaped fruits are called follicles. The follicles contain tan to brown seeds that are ovate in shape and 6\u20137 mm (0.24\u20130.28 in) long. The flat seeds have silky hairs that allow the seeds to float on air currents when the pod-like follicles dehisce (split open).[11]\r<br>\r<br>Cultivation\r<br>There are a number of different cultivars with improved flower colors and shorter habit; some have bright red, yellow or orange colored flowers. Asclepias curassavica is sometimes used in butterfly gardens (see above for concerns for monarchs) or as a cut flower. However, when the stems or leaves are broken, a poisonous milky sap exudes which can cause eye injury.[12]\r<br>\r<br>Distribution\r<br>Asclepias curassavica is described by NatureServe as a &quot;widespread species, ranging from southern North America through Central America and into South America.&quot;[1]\r<br>\r<br>It is an introduced species in the US states of California, Florida, Hawaii, Louisiana, Tennessee, and Texas, as well as the US unincorporated territories of Puerto Rico and the United States Virgin Islands.[13]\r<br>\r<br>It has been introduced and naturalized in the Chinese provinces of Anhui, Fujian, Guangdong, Guangxi, Guizhou, Hainan, Hubei, Hunan, Jiangsu, Jiangxi, Qinghai, Sichuan, Xizang, Yunnan, and Zhejiang, as well as in Taiwan.[5]\r<br>\r<br>It is considered an exotic plant, and a weed, at the Meteor Downs South Project near Rolleston, Queensland, Australia.", "comment_date": "2020-07-27T10:23:40Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Jimmy Shrimbe", "comment_text": "Amazing video, thanks Destin!", "comment_date": "2020-07-27T10:22:15Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Lynn Stillwell", "comment_text": "The flowers look like butterfly weed. \ud83d\ude42 Asclepias tuberosa", "comment_date": "2020-07-27T10:21:35Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "MNPWxXxGreenBeretDal", "comment_text": "Russian Spy: I been trying for years to infiltrate one of the new us nuclear powered submarines but I just can\u2019t get into one.

There was no rank, no positions, no retaliation for any commants. Anyone can say what they want but they have to listen to what anyone else says.<br><br>I wonder if the captain has been in with the enlisted men and said that it was a &quot;No B.S.&quot; time and removed his rank insignia. It would probably take a while for the crew to get used to it but it would probably become a great tool for him and others.<br><br>The first few times we had our &quot;No B.S.&quot; times it was akward for for us. Then the next couple of meetings became funny &quot;no b.s.&quot;session. It wasn&#39;t until the 4th or 5th &quot;no b.s.&quot; time that we really got into it and started sharing the details that we normally wouldn&#39;t share with upper management. But then this made it easier for us to bring up similar issues at any time.<br><br>We had grown as a group and were able to communicate issues we had that we were uncomfortable to bring up in the past. When I have told others what we used to do they thought that it would degenerate into a hate session or a venting session where were tell off others.<br><br>There was a little of that but then we started seeing the value in having a time where everyone was on the same level, there was no rank and no fear of retaliation for anything.", "comment_date": "2020-07-26T17:41:01Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Ziya \u00c7erezci", "comment_text": "beginning of the video feels like a battlefield mission", "comment_date": "2020-07-26T17:40:48Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Adam Ross", "comment_text": "<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RXXMJAU6vY8&amp;t=21m55s\">21:55</a> Connery from Hunt for Red October.

Over a third of the Toledo is restricted, and that makes a huge difference for those who are nuclear-trained. It means we have the run of the boat, while non-nuclear enlisted are limited to spaces forward of the reactor compartment.<br><br>Beyond the training and experiences afforded me during my service, the single most influential thing that sticks with me four decades after leaving the USS Will Rogers (SSBN 659) for the last time is, in a word, excellence. Nuclear submarines are a marvel of modern engineering, operating in an environment every bit as unforgiving as outer space, crewed by some of the most intelligent, dedicated and all-around incredible people one would ever meet.<br><br>Back in the day on a &quot;boomer&quot;, we deployed for 65 days submerged, operating on 18-hour days that consisted of 6 hours on watch, 6 hours studying and 6 hours sleeping. Most every &quot;free&quot; moment one had was spent studying, gaining proficiency and testing toward qualifications (earning one&#39;s dolphins). This took the better part of a minimum two tours.<br><br>I&#39;m very much looking forward to the next in your <i>Deep Dive</i> series on nuclear submarines.

Fortunately, the reactor was an on-shore nuclear prototype, so sinking was not an option.  I had orders to a &quot;boomer&quot; (ballistic missile submarine) when life intervened and I had to switch from nuclear service to the &quot;conventional&quot; (non-nuclear) surface fleet.<br><br>The initial feeling of loss, to not use the training I had worked so hard to learn, was crushing.  Fortunately, my arrival in the fleet turned out to be beyond awesome, as my nuclear training had taught me how to push myself harder than I had believed possible, so I started zooming up the ranks, gaining yet more schooling along the way, ultimately resulting in my being chosen to help &quot;buy&quot; a brand new destroyer from the shipyard on behalf of the Navy, then help put her into commission, making me a &quot;plankowner&quot; on that ship.<br><br>I was looking forward to making Chief in record time, but became disillusioned as I realized how much less time I would be spending with my beloved equipment and systems, and how much more leadership, administration, counselling, and all the other command, HR-like and &quot;paperwork&quot; functions I would take on.  I decided to stay technical, and tried to stay in the Navy while also going to college.  At the time, NESEP (the Navy Enlisted Science Education Program) had just been &quot;mothballed&quot;, so I knew I&#39;d have to leave active duty and use my GI Bill instead.<br><br>I became an engineer, and while I stayed in the US Navy Reserves from the day I left active duty until they forced me to finally retire, I&#39;ve worked as a civilian ever since.  My engineering career has been fantastic, and I&#39;ve been able to mainly do R&amp;D most of the time, closer to the scientists than the production engineers, though I&#39;ve also delivered many products to market.  But the key to it all was how the US Navy took a confused 18 year-old, skilled him up, then turned him loose on huge challenges.<br><br>I&#39;m forever grateful and honored.<br><br>However, this video was a bit hard to watch, in the &quot;I was so close&quot; sense.  I saw bits and pieces of systems that, to this day, many decades later, I still know extremely well.  The cadence of orders issued, acknowledged, and passed on.
