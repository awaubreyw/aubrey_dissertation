It is miraculous and more complex than we will understand, but simple enough to do at home. <br>1)  Purchase fertilized eggs, and  a simple heat lamp incubator from your local feed and seed, with some Microscope cover-slips, rubbing alcohol and a paraffin candle for the egg window.  <br>2) carefully take an egg and sterilize one side of the shell with rubbing alcohol The window needs to be on the side of the egg, not the top.  Note that the eggshell is both the lungs and kidneys for the developing chick. It needs to be handled gently. The chick will not develop without the shell. <br>3) (the hard part) CAREFULLY snip, nibble and chip a small shallow window in the side  of the eggshell  using a needle, exact o knife blade etc. the Window must be no deeper than  the width of the shell, and completely covered by the cover-slip. <br>4) place the cover-slip over the hole and gently hold it against the shell, then seal the edges by dripping melted wax from the candle around the edges of the cover slip to seal out air and infection. Again, the Egg shell is the lungs for the chick, and controls the amount of O2 and CO2 for the chick. Room air has too much CO2 and will make the inside of the egg acidic. <br>5) return the egg to the incubator with the cover-slip window up. The yolk and baby chick will naturally orient  and float to the highest surface under the cover-slip window, so you can watch the chicks development over time. The fluid dynamics of the ovalbumin, yolk and shell are miraculous physics. <br> If your school has a stereo-microscope capable of 100X , you will be able to see the blood flow within the arteries and veins, liver lungs and pancreas as they develop. Time laps pictures of the developing chick are awesome . Most importantly,  the camera for viewing through the egg window is best stabilized using the vistibular- ocular reflex of an adult chicken. Simply attach the camera to the chicken&#39;s head and place her over the developing chicks.

I guess he addressed to an initial part of consciousness before it grows to or shift to thinking, narrative part of mind. Buddha also said that as any creature (even a cat, human or a Divine being) dies, the last frequency which were responsible for the last few thoughts , will transfer to a suitable frequency level, may it be a chicken or a human baby or any other kind of being in any life plane. So my suggestion is, now it&#39;s time to focus your scientific experiments on those details at least to find if  they are real or not.
