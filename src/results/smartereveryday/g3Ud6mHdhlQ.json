They want the sub&#39;s side of the exchange to be at a higher pressure so the CO2 will be the one going into the ocean.

If you have a turbocharged race car set to hold 50psi of boost pressure, the fluid(air) in the cylinder is at 50psi before compression. When your fuel injectors open up to inject fuel, this exact same interaction is occurring. Fuel pressure is normally ~47psi, so air would flow into the injectors, starving the engine of fuel. In practice, fuel pressure regulators will receive a boost reference and automatically increase fuel pressure with boost to ensure fuel flows the correct way at a consistent and predictable flow rate.", "comment_date": "2022-06-08T06:11:26Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Erik's Forestry Vision", "comment_text": "Based upon your channel name and content.

If we don&#39;t pre-heat the rich MEA liquid, it will go into the boiler and cool down the MEA in boiler stripper stopping the continuous boiling process.<br>Example: That&#39;s like if you are boiling water in a saucepan and if you add cold water in that saucepan, water stops boiling for a bit until the temperature of the liquid (water) rise up to the boiling temperature again. Compared to when you add hot water in a boiling water, it starts boiling pretty quickly and if you add boiling water in a boiling pot, it will continue to boil without interruption. <br>Please feel free to comment if anyone needs me to elaborate even more, hope you find this helpful. <br>Thank you Dustin for amazing, very high quality and informative content.

The lean MEA from the boiler-stripper is too hot to absorb any CO2, so it has to be cooled down. Conveniently, the rich MEA from the absorber tower needs to be heated up. So a heat exchanger will do both at the same time using the heat from the lean MEA. This means that less energy from the reactor is needed to facilitate this process.

This &quot;pre-heats&quot; the amine before entering the &quot;distillation column&quot;, thus requiring less energy to heat it, and also causes the hot lean amine to lose heat before returning to the contact tower.  I suspect there may be additional cooling of the lean amine before returning to the contact tower, or perhaps cooling of the scrubbed air, otherwise they would be blowing around hot air, unless the heat exchanger is extremely efficient an provides sufficient cooling of the lean amine.

It&#39;s just opposite to regular osmosis.<br>TL;DR - it works like a filter. Push stuff through and what can get through, it will get there, everything else will be left behind.<br>Long story - regular osmosis happens when you have two substances divided with some restrictive membrane and they try to equalize concentration of everything. Let&#39;s take a balloon. If you will that with air, it will be aired up for a long time. There is some exchange in molecules through the rubber but you have the same concentration in and out, so not much will change. Fill it with hydrogen and something else happens. On the one hand, hydrogen concentration is close to 100% inside and very low outside so it really wants to get out. On the other hand there is much less oxygen, nitrogen and other gases inside so they try to get in. Over the time some of hydrogen escapes and some of other gases get in. Your hydrogen concentration goes down as the balloon gradually let&#39;s other gasses in. Obviously hydrogen is smaller than other elements so it escapes faster than other ones get in and that&#39;s why it will shrink quite quickly. The opposite happens when you fill the balloon with sulfur hexafluoride. This one has quite big molecules. That&#39;s why it makes your voice quite deep. In this case it also tries to escape but is slower than oxygen or nitrogen trying to get in. This way the balloon will actually grow as it fills with other gasses. Even better example would be with pure and dirty water. Let&#39;s say you have a tank split with membrane. This membrane lets water pass through but will filter out stuff like salt. Now one side is filled with pure water, other side is filled with salt water. Now they want to equalize concentrations but the salt can&#39;t get through the membrane. The only way is to get this pure water from the one side to the other and that&#39;s what happens. In ocean salt water you have roughly 3,5% of salt which (assuming no other substances) leaves just 96,5% water. So 100% water from the other side tries to get in but no salt can get out. In theory all of the water would then try to get on the other side until nothing is left behind, that&#39;s the only way it could equalize. We have gravity though and the more water you have on the one side, the more it is trying to flow back through the membrane. At some point both movements equalize and you will be left with two sides on the tank filled to different level. The same way dehydration works. If you drink fluids rich in minerals, then they will equalize concentration moving to your body. If you drink distilled water, then this water will pull minerals from your body.<br>You&#39;ve got the idea. So now you have the container with salt water on the one side and fresh on the other. Naturally osmosis pushes fresh water towards salt water to equalize concentrations. Now you can use a lot of force and push this water back through the membrane. This way you are increasing salt concentration by removing water on the one side and you are filling the other side with pure water. That&#39;s all it is. Reverse osmosis is quite fancy name for just very precise filter.", "comment_date": "2021-03-19T09:27:10Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Judd Poland", "comment_text": "Absolutely one of the best subjects and clear answers.

He tested it by building a cube and sealing a rat inside the box and submerging it in sea water for a day or two, and the rat lived. I think the guy was a scientist in Israel, but I&#39;m not sure of this. I think I read this in Popular Science. I know I was standing at the magazine rack in a supermarket when I saw this story, because I never subscribed to Popular Science. Then again it might have been in Scientific American.  The article went on to say that the Navy was interested in his invention.<br>I&#39;ve never seen anything else about this anywhere, and I have been looking.  Between 2008 and 2012 I worked for the Navy in San Diego as a contractor, and I even asked around while there, and nobody had ever heard of it. <br>So I don&#39;t know if it was really a working thing.

Who knows if you read it. I need help designing and making a structure that is not electronic but mechanical in design.<br><br>So, the inside layer is simply a compass. The secondary layer (outer sphere) I want it to be able to track fixed points towards our centre solar system. IE like the galactic median. I was thinking that setup process may include pointing at no fixed points from earth, thus it simply tracks the fixes locations of star cluster creating an intersecting points (cross hairs) of our solar system.  Then a third layer of fixes galaxies towards our galaxy, painting crosshairs on our galaxy. I thin it would be fun and useful... Of course... the centre of our galaxy is offset from out location, just as earth is offset form the solar system centre for the previous one.... <br><br>My thoughts is if you like nasa, or navigation. A mechanical globe with layered spherical latices with points could rotate to those locations during night or day, so you always know your position relative to our observable universe.. which is good practice if one is traveling.... Compass direction give us 2D directions on earth... Solar system directions give us 3d dimensional directions on EARTH, but 3d directions in our solar system.. the process continues. their simply looking for stable points between systems of hierarchy that are stable enough to be used as accurate reference to conceptualize where we are in the universe. On earth without magnets it would be hard to create a reference of movement, with the stars changing, one would have to have a very good understanding of timing and location already to use the stars to conceptualize where the planet they are. Setting this up would change depending on fixed objects targeted in the sky...<br><br>maybe that makes no sense, but it sounds like fun.. knowing your place in the universe... Universal navigator.. the reason I was thinking mechanical system, or limited energy, is that it would work in any place within our Galaxy. without the need of outside source of power except the person, winding it or whatever is used to track, and power its movements.... and with base knowledge one could set it up... to navigate again.. hmm...  lost in space..  with a ... galactic compass. lol... rather then a solar or terrestrial one. :D", "comment_date": "2021-02-24T19:29:07Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Ectar", "comment_text": "The amine absorbs CO2 better when cold, so after the amine gets heated up in the boiler and had its CO2 driven off, first the now lean amine is used to preheat the incoming rich amine in a heat exchanger.This helps to cool the lean amine as well as pre-heat the rich amine, which reduces the amount of external heating and cooling that needs to be done, saving energy.

I\u2019d like to answer why they use a preheater in the MEA column. (Chemical engineer here). Absorbing CO2 by MEA is a reversible reaction with an equilibrium. MEA holds CO2 only at lower temperatures, heating it up releases it as it does in the stripper which is a pressurized boiler. This produces lean MEA, but hot lean MEA cannot absorb CO2. To shift the equilibrium back in favor of absorbing CO2, we have to cool it. So why use energy to heat the MEA and then energy to cool it back down? Instead use the hot lean MEA exiting the stripper to heat the cold rich MEA entering the stripper. Viola, you solved the cooling and heating energy requirements (this is not 100% efficient ofcourse but you\u2019re saving huge here). This is called heat integration (heat recovery) Remember the submariner said there\u2019s a heat exchanger (HEX). The preheater you didn\u2019t understand the purpose of is this HEX.

And thank you to all whom gets into your picture, people, countries &amp; as such as when it comes to military, secrets to. As we all know. Some things cant be showed or said &amp; some that is nothing new either &amp; could be said &amp; showed ofc as well.<br><br>Some info as blue prints numbers or said by words, cannot. When it comes to devices or huge machine vehicles, as such may &amp; are mostly over a time or a long time still secret, till it one day falls into the tech &amp; Sci box &amp; open ups for the public, Onto. How does that work &amp; why, like * GetSmarterEveryDay! :)<br><br>So happy for all the things they where allowed to share &amp; say out on the camera &amp; editited into this movie &amp; if something anyway was hidden or cut out? It\u00b4s ofc very understanding :) And or if some area\u00b4s for you even Destin Wilson Sandlin, wasn&#39;t allowed for you to access, such is understandable as well. :-)<br><br>I liked this episode very much, when it comes to extrodenery amazing human inventions machines, as a Sub that can actually go under the water in many diff depths &amp; stay down there for days or weeks. All there diff strange radars &amp; such, re clean air &amp; or water as well?, Weather it\u00b4s a Civil Explore Sci Sub that explores ocean bottom like, 11.000m below or military Subs for there purposes.<br><br>All this &amp; yet we do understand how it\u00b4s possible &amp; but it\u00b4s always fun to gain all those much more deeper informations, onto how for exempel, how can a such giant metal monster dive under the surface &amp; then emerge up on the surface again? Or how can they stay under the water for a such long time, as you do show &amp; explain to us between &amp; the vid cuts &amp; that we are hearing those Sub sailors telling you/us. :)<br><br>So truly happy honestly Destin Wilson Sandlin, for some perhaps, people are eye roiling by now of what I might write up here before you? lol<br>But if we really didn&#39;t had such knowledge or tech, we would know so much less about our Seas nature &amp; all. Subs, all in all. Is &amp; could be really one of the most important tech &amp; Sci that we humans as ever invented &amp; created, all the puzzles &amp; items that needs to be in a Sub, to be fully function-ell/operational, the way they function today &amp; always, year per year each old item getting upgraded to a better functionality &amp; new Subs models tech as well. It\u00b4s truly fantastical. Weather Civ sci subs or military. :) <br><br>Thank you once again Destin Wilson Sandlin from the deepness of my heart, for all the years, for all that you do &amp; making such amazing episodes &amp; adventures &amp; cheering it with the people around the world &amp; giving us answers, and making as a bet smarter every day <b>smiles</b> &amp; or, some of us don&#39;t have to wonder for them self in all eternity sometimes in life, as we all do step across such thoughts, about one thing or another, onto why or how does this or that really work?? :D<br><br>Thank you, stay safe be well &amp; remember to smile a few times everyday Destin Wilson Sandlin! :-)<br><br>PS.

The burning iron is fed by the Chlorate decomposition, so although it is a fire which consumes oxygen to generate the heat, more oxygen is made than is consumes. The danger is that such an intense heat and abundance of oxygen can cause other materials to combust and it is tremendously important on a submarine that lubricants do not get into the candle as these may react explosively with the oxygen.", "comment_date": "2021-02-23T08:06:52Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "realzero.", "comment_text": "the DOW guy looks like technoblade", "comment_date": "2021-02-23T08:02:27Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "swety", "comment_text": "ohayo", "comment_date": "2021-02-23T08:01:39Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Sarah Mj Stauffer", "comment_text": "Oxygen tanks?", "comment_date": "2021-02-23T07:55:07Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "G-Rated", "comment_text": "<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3Ud6mHdhlQ&amp;t=22m36s\">22:36</a> Glad you finally got that Coca Cola sponsorship.

During my time on the USS Pennsylvania SSBN 735,  one of my duties was standing the Auxiliary Electrician Forward watch. I became very familiar with CAMS MKII, and how to create O2 from electrolysis and burning of chlorate candles.  Oftentimes, I would make recommendations to the OOD to increase the amperage of the EOGs in order to make higher concentrations of O2.  Generally, we like to have the O2 around 18.5%...just enough to be up and doing things, but also low enough so those who wanted to sleep could sleep. Again, thank you for these videos.

The general process is call &quot;amine gas treating&quot; and is a fairly old process used to remove unwanted components (specifically hydrogen sulphide, or H2S, and carbon dioxide, or CO2) from process gas streams. Our company is really more geared towards simulating this process for industrial chemical plant scale equipment (refineries and gas plants) but the general process is basically the same as what they&#39;re using onboard that sub.<br><br>The exchanger is a lean/rich exchanger that exchanges thermal energy from the hot lean amine to the cooler rich amine. This serves two purposes: 1. to off load some of the thermal duty from the boiler (so you don&#39;t have to input as much energy) and 2. to cool down the lean amine before it returns to the absorber. Amine absorbs more efficiently at cooler temperatures. Absorbers are also typically run at higher pressures, but since they&#39;re sucking air in from the &quot;atmosphere&quot; it wouldn&#39;t really make much sense to compress that. That&#39;s also why they spray instead of using some sort of internal component (such as packing) since these internals increase the pressure drop through the tower and if you&#39;re already at atmospheric pressure you can&#39;t really accept much pressure drop at all. Internals would dramatically increase the available surface area available for the absorption process to take place since this process (or the rate at which the CO2 can be absorbed into the liquid) is governed by mass transfer. <br><br>Honestly after trying to explain this in a comment, just google &quot;amine based carbon capture&quot; and you&#39;ll probably come up with a much more comprehensive explanation or article.

I think you should start putting a quick 5-10 second intro graphic/song or something (not annoyingly long, but just long enough to give us viewers a few seconds to adjust the volume on our TV&#39;s or computers before you jump into the meat of your videos).  It&#39;s a bit annoying having to often restart the video because you&#39;re so no-nonsense that you just jump right into it while I&#39;m still trying to adjust my my TV&#39;s volume. :)<br><br>Anyway, we appreciate everything you are doing.  Keep making these great videos!<br><br>Thanks", "comment_date": "2021-02-22T19:57:43Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Fahim Akhter", "comment_text": "Why don&#39;t they use small plants for oxygen  generation and carbon dioxide removing", "comment_date": "2021-02-22T19:57:02Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Ben Rusnak", "comment_text": "Candle boy wearing vans?", "comment_date": "2021-02-22T19:56:35Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "KayaYautja", "comment_text": "The science is great and all but dear lord, Princes Boopersnoot.

I believe our system bubbled the gas up through the amine, rather than spraying amine on top of it.<br><br>That preheat function you said you didn&#39;t understand is most likely (based on my experience with our system) just a heat exchanger where the hot lean amine they just removed CO2 from runs by the cooler rich amine (there are a bunch of different methods but ultimately they&#39;re trying to maximize surface area contact, either through separate plates, a series of tubes, or some other method). They never mix, they&#39;re just trying to move heat from the lean amine to the rich amine. This serves a dual purpose. First, they&#39;re &quot;pre-heating&quot; the rich amine so they use less energy to heat it and boil off the CO2 later. Second, they&#39;re cooling the lean amine. As you know, the cooler the lean amine is, the more CO2 it can absorb. They may have to cool it further (I suspect they do), but that helps the process along.<br><br>For us, the preheater saved us burning some of our sellable product (methane) for heating.

The MEA is a very strong base, but it is also an organic chemical which means it can be easily absorbed into human tissue, it&#39;s flammable and volatile. An MEA leak in sufficient amounts would absorbed through a person&#39;s lungs and kill the tissue in your lungs quickly, unless of course an explosion killed you first. Both of these chemical reactions in the sub&#39;s systems are very dangerous, but under the right conditions they&#39;re controlled carefully. It&#39;s fascinating!

The preheating is there done with a heat exchanger where the hot lean MEA coming from the stripper meets the cool rich MEA from the absorber. This both saves energy for heating plus you want the lean MEA to be cool so it absorbs CO2 better. But I&#39;ve never heard anyone pronounce it amine lika Amy. It&#39;s chemically related to amino acids so I say the a in amine like amino acid or ammunition.<br><br>Edit: <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3Ud6mHdhlQ&amp;t=21m25s\">21:25</a> about the boiler/stripper having high(er) pressure. The stripper shall have relatively low pressure since that promotes gases to leave the liquid. Some strippers are run at vacuum to make the boiling at lower temperature (a little less than 100 \u00b0C) but most common is around 1 atm. It would surprise me if the stripper has any significant over pressure since that would require higher temperature and also breaks down the MEA faster.", "comment_date": "2021-02-21T15:43:32Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Nipuna Weerasekara", "comment_text": "Can someone make CC?
