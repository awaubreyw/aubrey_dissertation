If the pecan husk looks like it is open but the pecan does not fall when you shake the tree then those are bad pecans. Normally it is because a fungus has gotten on them during development from too much humidity and not enough air flow between the trees and it kills the juices that circulate to the developing nut. The other reason is from moths that lay their eggs in the new tiny baby pecan, and the larvae eats the inside of the developing nut.  In the first case then that never finished maturing so it never really completely let go of the hull. In the second case the nut never finished developing because of being eaten from the inside. The first doesn&#39;t fall when you shake the tree so the bad ones actually stay off of the ground.

Short answer - Climate Change.

Late September is when you expect the turn from summer to fall through quite literally through the fall equinox. The flowers don&#39;t open because of temperatures being too warm despite having the right amount of radiation from the sun. (flowering proteins could be temperature and light sensitive. Different breeds of pecans could extend the variation to prevent seedling competition) The seed ejection gets desynced so harvest season comes later than expected.

Even though this astronomical event happens every 20 years, but tonight it&#39;s special because jupiter and saturn is so close, the last time this has happened was on the year 1226. Unfortunately it&#39;s very hard to see in my area because of weather conditions and the event taking place very low on the horizon.", "comment_date": "2020-12-21T05:56:35Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "vbddfy euuyt", "comment_text": "Destin: &quot;Pecans make everything better.&quot; Me: &quot;Deathly alergic to peanuts and treenuts.&quot;", "comment_date": "2020-12-21T05:54:41Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Gin Mador", "comment_text": "wifes jokes please", "comment_date": "2020-12-21T03:55:51Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Juliano Azz", "comment_text": "That was very sweet intro with your dad man", "comment_date": "2020-12-21T02:10:29Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Bradle 101", "comment_text": "The dog in the background at <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aK5AnViPkJ0&amp;t=0m48s\">0:48</a> looks like my dog", "comment_date": "2020-12-21T01:54:31Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "KaeGeeTV", "comment_text": "WAIT ARE YOU FROM  MOBILE ALABAMA???", "comment_date": "2020-12-21T00:21:37Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Christopher Scallio", "comment_text": "Will you be filming the Anti-Christ Sign of Jupiter &amp; Saturn near Pluto on December 21, 2020 Dustin?", "comment_date": "2020-12-20T23:53:35Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "rnqtn", "comment_text": "This is so wholesome.

They&#39;re cherries, so they&#39;re soft and can&#39;t hit the ground, which is another problem to solve. So they run around with two big machines, the shaker and the catcher, with giant tarps that fit together and funnel all the cherries onto the catcher. Shaker shakes, it&#39;s pretty much identical to the tractor here, aside from being a dedicated machine instead of a tractor attachment. The catcher is really interesting, though. Everything funnels down onto it, and it has a conveyer belt that feeds everything into a water-filled tote in the back, to transport the cherries. On the end it drops everything over an air blower to knock most of the leaves and twigs and bad cherries out of it, then when the tote&#39;s full they drop it, swap it for a new one, and a tractor hauls the full one off. I was just a little guy, so I was on tote filling and cleaning duty. Fill them about a third full, and when they&#39;re brought back we scraped everything that floated- more leaves and rotten cherries- out of them, then we capped a lid on them and they were loaded onto the truck. Grandpa had something like 200 acres back in the day. I grew up in great grandpa&#39;s house, on a 20 acre plot.

For example he has saved my life a TON of times. Been hit by a \ud83d\ude97 as a little girl, been in a burning \ud83d\ude97, Been in a ton of car accidents in general... I guess you can say I have a history with vehicles lol. \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02 But each time I walked away without a scratch. Many times when I could have died God would lead me to know what to do and he would save my life. The Holy Spirit would speak to me. In general as I draw closer to God, I can hear when he speaks to me including he has warned me of many things before they happen. Including on 12/31/2019 as I was celebrating new yrs he kept telling me this yr would be very prophetic, I kept hearing those words over and over again. And I had a heaviness in my \u2764, I knew it wasn&#39;t going to be good but something bad...it made me not want 2020 to start. We have for sure seen all that has taken place in 2020 with covid and natural disasters etc... And I see these things lining up with Bible prophecy... I have so many testimonies of how God has works in my life... That there is NO WAY I could EVER DENY HIM!!! He gives me peace and comfort in all my challenges in life and he leads my life path and as I TRUST in HIM ALONE.... He always takes care of me and shows me his great love for me!!! I would encourage you to pray and ask God to reveal himself to you and if you seek him with your ENTIRE HEART I know he will show you he is VERY REAL!! Jesus Christ is My King of Kings, Lord of Lords!!! One way to know if God of the Bible is real is to read Revelations and see what is taking place also read Matthew 24 in KJV bible. Ask God to give you eyes to see and ears to hear what The Holy Spirit is saying!!! The mark of the beast will be implemented soon in Rev. Chapter 13 of the Bible and people need to choose Jesus Christ as their savior and repent, believe in him alone and invite the Holy Spirit into their lives before the judgements start...because by default if you don&#39;t choose Jesus Christ you choose Satan. Many believe there are many ways to God. But the Bible says you can only get to the Father through his son Jesus Christ and his gift of dying for us and believe in the finished work on the cross!! I am praying for you and anyone reading this to please take my WARNING serious and know this comes from a place of LOVE in my heart for you!!!! \ud83d\ude4f\ud83d\udc9d\ud83d\ude0a", "comment_date": "2020-12-08T21:25:51Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Fuvity", "comment_text": "I wanna be like this dude when I group up", "comment_date": "2020-12-08T21:25:26Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "w8stral", "comment_text": "&quot;There are no squirrels here...&quot;  &quot;I&#39;ll bet you are pretty good with a .22&quot;   !!!!!

I would suggest, in the long run, that slowly finding the direction with the most thorough shaking then marking that down would be better for the lifespan health of the trees as it would allow much lower input to achieve the same results - resulting in less root stress and trauma to the vertical roots.", "comment_date": "2020-12-07T14:45:39Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Alexey", "comment_text": "Is it Tim Cook?", "comment_date": "2020-12-07T14:43:49Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Sally Dghma", "comment_text": "Uuuuuuuu", "comment_date": "2020-12-07T14:42:24Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "MaKbE", "comment_text": "I love vibratord", "comment_date": "2020-12-07T14:42:09Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Let my Spirit Go Free", "comment_text": "Wife keeps taking it to bed", "comment_date": "2020-12-07T14:42:09Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "dredre8424", "comment_text": "Watch this whole video, knew nothing about pecan before now I feel like an expert", "comment_date": "2020-12-07T14:41:34Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Joshua Payne", "comment_text": "As someone in the Agriculture industry, Thank you for doing videos like these and please do more!", "comment_date": "2020-12-07T14:41:20Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Hayden Boettcher", "comment_text": "I think it\u2019s safe to say we all want a high speed shot of that nut cracker working", "comment_date": "2020-12-07T14:41:18Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Jeb Stuart", "comment_text": "My wife needs a vibrator like that.", "comment_date": "2020-12-07T14:37:43Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Adam Cai", "comment_text": "I like this man, he seems to be a nice guy", "comment_date": "2020-12-07T14:36:46Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "nn", "comment_text": "I thought we would see the nutcracker in action in slow motion.", "comment_date": "2020-12-07T14:36:43Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "AdamandRachel O'Connor", "comment_text": "WOW!

According to them, China conducts 60,000 to 100,000 organ transplants every year through organs taken from prisoners of conscience. Most of the organs were taken from Falun Gong practitioners.\r<br>\r<br>\u201cIn recent years, people suspected that the organs of Uighur Muslims living in Xinjiang are stolen. Uighurs are undergoing health tests and blood tests. According to [Enver Tohti, a former Uighur surgeon who witnessed the Chinese regime\u2019s harvesting of organs from prisoners], the purpose of the test was to form a live bank of human organs along with information about Tibetan and Christians of underground churches.\r<br>\r<br>\u201cHowever, most of the evidence proves that the organs are from Falun Gong practitioners. There are 800,000 to 3 million people in Chinese concentration camps and prisons. The limited transparency of these camps means that there are no exact figures [about] the seriousness of the problem.\u201d", "comment_date": "2020-12-07T05:00:20Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "TheRealLuke", "comment_text": "shake deez nuts.

For as many as have received him, to them, God gave them the power to become the sons of God, who were born not of blood, nor of the will of man, nor of the will of the flesh, but of God. For the Lord Jesus prayed for to the Father that they who receive him may be in him even as the Father is in him and he in the Father. The Lord Jesus Christ is the only mediator between God and men and he is the way, the truth and the life, no man cometh unto the Father but by him. Therefore, unto all they who will receive him, receive the power to become the sons of God. And these signs shall follow them that believe, in the name of Jesus they shall cast out devils, they shall speak with new tongues, they shall take up serpents and scorpions and if they drink any deadly thing it shall not harm them, and they shall lay hands upon the sick and they shall recover. For in the Son of God dwelleth all the fullness of the Godhead bodily, and to I, my brethren, and to all else that will receive him shall also attain the same power which the Son of God showed to his people, the Jews. Yea, and even greater works than those which the Son of God doeth, shall that man that receiveth the Word of life shall do because the Son goeth unto his Father. Therefore I say unto as many as will receive him, repent and be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of sins and ye shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost.

I can only imagine what you are going through but God knows.<br> I also know how difficult life can be and I may not understand your exact experience but I am truly sorry that things have been so tough for you. I care and want you to know that you are not alone, you have a purpose, you are worthy of so much. Please take it one day at a time, one step at a time.<br> I am praying that God will send His angels to each and everyone of you to comfort you, surround you with His love, give you peace beyond measure, and to change things for the better.<br> Please know that you are here for a reason and that sometimes we don&#39;t always know why we go through things, maybe to help someone else going through the same thing because you understand such pain that someone else may not. <br> Please also know you also have a Savior Jesus Christ who died for you, He loves you more than you could ever know. Please ask Him for forgiveness of wrongs and ask Him into your heart believing with sincerity. ( Please see the book the Holy Bible for more information)<br>He can guide you in all things. I speak from experience it doesn&#39;t matter what we have done or that we think we don&#39;t measure up He will meet us where we are, even in our lowest low. He can give you peace beyond measure, I speak from experience. I can only imagine how hard it has been for you but I truly hope the best is yet to come for all of you. Please never give up, because He won&#39;t give up on us. Please remember this when things are hard and you feel at the end of your rope. <br>To give your life to Jesus Christ here is a sample prayer:<br>Dear Lord Father in Heaven<br>I admit I am a sinner.

After the harvester filled the dump trailer, we would go back to the barn to sort the pecans. I had the job of making sure all the pecans were being dumped as quick as possible, so I would literally climb to the top of the upended dump trailer and sort of slide down with the pecans so that they didn&#39;t hit any issues where the pecans stopped feeding onto the conveyor belt.

In something like the early 30s, my Pawpa (Grandfather) planted a single pecan tree in the back yard of their home on the Mississippi Gulf coast. Over the years, the squirrels Na&#39;nee loved so much were responsible for the sprouting of several more trees in both back and front yard. Every spring Na&#39;nee would pull up dozens of saplings trying to keep the tree count to three in the back and two in the front. A few of those saplings account for the three trees now growing in my brother&#39;s yard in North Carolina and one in an old front yard of mine in Virginia Beach. Somewhere I have a photo of a little, four foot 10in French lady, snow white hair and wearing a pith helmet, chasing squirrels out of her pecan trees with a 25 foot aluminum pole. This was her fall time vigilance that went on for as long as I can remember.  Every Christmas my mom would receive a box with about 25 lbs of <b>shelled and picked</b> pecans. It also included a dozen or so jars of preserved figs from Na&#39;nee&#39;s 100 year old fig tree, but that&#39;s another story.<br>P.S. Try cooking some bare, naked chicken on the grill, but instead of charcoal, make your fire with the fallen sticks and limbs of the pecan trees. Keep adding twigs and sticks slowly as the chicken cooks.

I grew up next to a neighbor like this man, who wasn&#39;t in it for a huge profit either. He had an 80 year old small grove of peaches and he sold a bushel of the best peaches I&#39;d ever eaten in my life for 10 to 14 bucks...and it was a big bushel. That small orchard is around 120 years old now, and the trees have branches falling off every year due to the softball sized peaches not being groomed and just left to grow full till the weight snaps the branches...almost all those trees have perished since he passed away and nobody was left to continue maintaining the trees. He was a really good man too..didn&#39;t mind us as kids passing through his property to play in the river or hunt in his woods as long as we stopped and talked to him if we saw him. Since he passed away, his wife sold most of the old growth timbers and leased the fields out to a taxidermist who hunted all the game pretty much off it. It took them a few years to almost kill that place entirely...but my memories of how it was when Mr. McPhearson was alive won&#39;t ever die. It was a 6,000 acre old plantation property nobody lived on anymore, with two old houses that crumbled in on themselves...and many fields for farmer, and it stretch a few miles along the bend in a river in North Carolina.

For the mathematics of the shaking, what is happening is essentially a series of inverted double pendulums, constrained by the modulus of rigidity of the individual branches (possible topic for a video, as double pendulum systems are great examples of chaotic motion with a relatively simple setup).    I really liked how you experimented with the 90\u00b0 offset of the shaking energy impulse, though there is one more potential test that could be done: shake in both directions simultaneously.   This would require a shaker modification, with the weight axle turned 90\u00b0 to be horizontal vs vertical.   In this way rather than imparting a single axis impulse of energy it would impart a circular impulse, essentially creating an inverted double Furuta pendulum setup which might have a higher degree of chaos displacement at the nut, or it might not since each branch connection point will have a preferred resonant frequency axis, so the Furuta effect may damp out.   With the nature of chaotic systems, this would be both interesting to model and to experiment with.  The other variable to experiment with is the speed of the shaking, controllable by the PTO driven RPM, to find the best resonant frequency for each tree...<br><br>The story of whomever first came up with the &quot;shake the tree&quot; method of harvesting would be fascinating.  I can just envision some farmer with hand pickers accidentally bumping the tree with a tractor, seeing a large number of nuts fall, and having a eureka moment.", "comment_date": "2020-12-06T17:09:43Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Mabelle Landry", "comment_text": "I love the new music for the slow mo sections! &lt;3", "comment_date": "2020-12-06T17:09:31Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Devon Lockwood", "comment_text": "Everyone of your videos is just awesome!", "comment_date": "2020-12-06T17:09:25Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "RADHE VIRANI", "comment_text": "Hey Destin which degree you have??", "comment_date": "2020-12-06T17:09:25Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Casey", "comment_text": "This was a great video!
