I mean sure you probably can&#39;t grow large amounts (I mean where would you find the space) but what about even just fresh edible herbs? A lot of herbs grow really quickly, take little space and don&#39;t need much besides a little water and a little light. There are many lightweight and mess free plant growth materials too besides the option of growing herbs just in water, the lamps to provide light can also be small compact and lightweight and power shouldn&#39;t be a problem with a nuclear reactor, plants will naturally help with eating some carbon dioxide and provide a little more additional oxygen which would be a helpful addition, and you can probably find crooks and crannies all over the sub to attach small planters.

So different now. So much pre-made food now. For example, we had a 8lb. block of sausage where we had to make patties by hand not frozen links. We had regular round pizza pans. I made about 75 pizzas. SINGLE HANDEDLY!!! Many specialty by request to order. We put out a meal every six hours, not 8. So while I was doing all those pizzas, I also would be squeezing in anything I could do to be ahead on my regular deserts and breads for the next day&#39;s meals. There always seamed to be cookies the next day........<br>Our shortening, flour, sugar and coffee came in 5 gallon tin cans which were stored under the main engines back aft where I had to climb down into a hole then crawl on my belly for about 15 feet until I reached the larger area where they were all strategically stored then crawl back out with that huge square can. There was no can opener on the boat so the expectation was that we cut it open with a large chef&#39;s knife. Eventually, I snuck onboard one of those store bought hand can openers. I wore my dungaree pants, a white tee shirt and the boat&#39;s ball cap or an F.S.A. tee shirt. Food on the boat was stored EVERYWHERE!<br>If we&#39;d had jalapeno poppers on the boat, I would have had to make them from scratch. We did put out wings also on Pizza night. 18 hour shift every day at sea. I was awoken at 5pm and was in the galley in time to help clean up from dinner. Then I put out mid-rats at mid night then breakfast at 6am then I would go to the rack as soon as lunch was put out at <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bPJUVKizh90&amp;t=11m30s\">11:30</a> for some people&#39;s early chow.

First off, it&#39;s a matter of longevity and space.   Frozen sliced bell peppers is much more space saving than whole fresh ones, and will last much longer.  With a 90 day larder, feeding 140-180 people, that&#39;s requires a lot of space, which as you saw is at a total premium in there.  I was surprised that the frozen food wasn&#39;t in trays for airflow and getting access.  I know I would have stocked it according to the meal plan, so I&#39;d have easy access for the meal rotations - Monday&#39;s meals in trays 1,2,3, and so on.  I would not want to have to &quot;clean the freezer&quot; - ever. Next, there&#39;s a much larger opportunity for insects and vermin to get on board with fresh food. Hard to use pesticides on a submarine.  I can&#39;t even begin to imagine how these guys can even breathe after working in that space every day.  There ought to be some serious air filtration in that space, as I am sure the gunge would build up quite easily in there. Gunge -  so when people smoke on board, it gets trapped in the moisture in the air. The metal walls are cold, so it condenses, creating a viscous tar-like liquid and can come down the walls and puddle in places.

It is a common practice for junior enlisted from aircraft squadrons to work T.A.D. for ships company. The food was atrocious, handled with the utmost disrespect for the crews health and most of the cooks couldn&#39;t care less about quality. The good ones with integrity almost always worked in the officers mess or the chiefs mess. Food left out for days without refrigeration, frozen food served and mixed in with unfrozen and burned food. CS (culinary specialist) is one of the few jobs in the Navy someone can have a career without a clearance so that is where you get a lot of criminals who took military service over the penitentiary. The aft baker was one of the laziest people I ever saw. Somewhere in leadership they wanted cookies to be put out, most likely to help with crew moral. This baker would only make oatmeal raisin because he knew most people wouldn&#39;t eat them and could keep putting out the same batch day after day. They would become hard and gained a real reputation for being terrible, fulfilling the cycle. He could make 200 cookies and they would last a whole week for an enlisted crew of about 2500!<br><br>I had a friend who worked in the Admirals galley who would pass out leftovers on occasion and the food was almost the same type but was obviously prepared with care so I know the problem is not the material condition. About 1/2 the food being prepared in the aft galley was not something which is cooked, just heated up with water and served. When I eventually went back to my squadron the sentiment about the galley was the same, that the galley food was nothing to look forward to and often people just ate tuna and crackers from the ships store instead.", "comment_date": "2020-11-06T21:03:17Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "christopher lobato", "comment_text": "Obviously somebody decided submerged fishing wasnt a good idea", "comment_date": "2020-11-06T20:32:59Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Laurance Moseley", "comment_text": "Anybody else now want to know what bug juice is ?     @6;52", "comment_date": "2020-11-06T20:03:18Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Aaldorabi", "comment_text": "I feel like smartereveryday is giving a lot of informations about militaries.  :/", "comment_date": "2020-11-06T19:46:50Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Darragh Burke", "comment_text": "What&#39;s the ability to have a  snack on a submarine", "comment_date": "2020-11-06T19:24:50Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Steve Michael", "comment_text": "I can\u2019t believe they\u2019re watching the movie down periscope.

At the time we had no idea what had happened to cause us to have a sudden extreme roll.  Years later it happened to another sub and cause was determined to be a tsunami.  A surface ship on deep water would have just ridden over another unremarkable wave.  Almost all of the energy of a tsunami is under the water.  When that energy wave his us it said HELLO in a large unexpected way.  No idea it was coming but per standard procedures most all  items were stowed and secured.  That does not include the crew which must be able to be mobile constantly.

I was reminded of that when our church choir sang a beautiful anthem based on Psalm 103. \u201cBless the Lord, O my soul, and forget not all His benefits\u201d (v. 2 nkjv). The Lord is our forgiver, healer, redeemer, provider, satisfier, and renewer (vv. 4-5). How could we forget that? And yet we often do when the events of daily life shift our attention to pressing needs, recurring failures, and circumstances that seem out of control.        <br><br>The writer of this psalm calls us to remember, \u201cThe Lord is compassionate and gracious...He does not treat us as our sins deserve or repay us according to our iniquities. For as high as the heavens are above the earth, so great is his love for those who fear him\u201d (vv. 8,10-11).  By humbling ourselves before God, it opens us up to the blessings of His mercy. In our walk of faith, we come to Jesus Christ humbled by our unworthiness. There is no sense of entitlement as we receive His grace and are overwhelmed by the lavishness of His love.        <br><br>Never loose sight of the GREAT and AWESOME benefits of acknowledging that you are a sinner in need of our Savior. Confess with your mouth and believe in your heart that Jesus is Lord of your life. Welcome Abba Yahweh (Father God) through Yeshua (Jesus the Christ) into your life. Receive grace by believing in Jesus Christ and what He did on the cross, His death, burial and resurrection for the sins of all mankind.

When morale on the boat is low, they will have the cook make up something extra special....pull something from the &quot;special recipe playbook&quot; to boost morale during hard times. They said especially if a large portion of the crew are from a specific geographical area. They will make something ultra specific and regional, barring ingredients, to give morale a shot in the arm. They also said that it is so strategic that the cook will always keep an eye out for these special ingredients at the upcoming ports, to make sure they have their &quot;aces in the hole&quot; ready for when the captain needs it. Whether thats all true or not, I don&#39;t know but its a story that they all adhere to. I never realized how important the cooks job was but this video helped reinforce it.

U might not be a teacher but u sure do make many people  intrested in stuff u would never think is interesting  I think there should be classes in school just to play videos like urs to students  cuz everyone need that 1 teacher to inspire them to think big and I really think you could be that teacher with ur overwhelming  excitment  for everything you do.
