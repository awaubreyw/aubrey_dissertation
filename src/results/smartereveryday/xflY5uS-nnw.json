He told a story about a flight of four P-47&#39;s getting jumped by 40 Messerschmidt Me-109&#39;s and the Colonel who was lead said they&#39;d better climb into the cloud ceiling. These P-47&#39;s were fitted with the new Paddle Props and they had a button for Water Injection. I have seen Water Injection in other engines as well, spraying a Water-Methanol mixture in to cool the cylinder walls so that more fuel and air can fit in with each intake stroke.<br><br>It&#39;s easy to understand the physical concept of Water Injection, but it&#39;s hard to envision how this could increase engine performance as tremendously as it did. So, if @SmarterEveryDay is revisiting the See Through Engine in Slow Motion, I wonder if it is possible for these ingenious engine tinkerers to fit it with a Water-Methanol injection system to see how effective it really is on engine performance, and if it gives a visibly better effect on the combustion?", "comment_date": "2022-01-24T20:32:06Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "X Trending", "comment_text": "Wow", "comment_date": "2022-01-24T19:56:06Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Jojan Mercado", "comment_text": "Car engine inventor- wow very smart humans<br><br>Airplane engine inventor- hold my beer", "comment_date": "2022-01-20T15:10:50Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "SlimxShady", "comment_text": "What brings the piston back up during the compression and exhaust strokes?

If it is, find a new girlfriend. <br><br>Engines are just like people.<br>Love your engine.<br>Take your engine to the car Dr regularly for a check up.<br>Change your oil and make sure it is well lubricated. Oil is literally the blood of the engine, so make sure it has nice, good, healthy blood... Not blood that&#39;s as black as your mothers soul. <br>Change your anti freeze at least once every few years... Because just like people, if an engine gets too hot, it dies. <br><br>If you treat your engine as if it were a person, your engine will last forever.<br><br>Sincerely,<br>A Mechanic", "comment_date": "2020-12-27T03:45:31Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "ilovetanks134", "comment_text": "i have a question on the one they made the explosion is loud but how come we cant hear it in our cars", "comment_date": "2020-12-26T21:36:49Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Rahul", "comment_text": "GOD engineering is AWESOME!!!!", "comment_date": "2020-12-26T16:06:28Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Austin Eutslerj", "comment_text": "Awesome video.

I want to know how it is achieved: 1) preventing exhaust valve to go down in 3rd stroke and (2) what drives intake and exhaust valves?<br>I&#39;m a computer engineering so don&#39;t know much, only read about these interesting things in first year for basics\ud83d\ude05.", "comment_date": "2020-10-26T10:25:04Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Austin Lester", "comment_text": "I know what\u2019s goin on inside my motor I build drag racing motors all the time", "comment_date": "2020-10-26T02:07:55Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "firasse #", "comment_text": "Fact A 15-year-old teenager ... was fornicating with his high school teacher, who is 40 years old, and who has 3 children, two of whom are older than him!

This is called valve overlap<br>1 Allows more time to fill the cylinder<br>2 Scavenging: The exhaust charge leaving the cylinder creates a low pressure area (vacuum) behind it which pulls in more fuel at a higher velocity<br>3 Incoming intake charge helps expel exhaust gasses<br><br>Atmospheric pressure at sea level is 14.7PSI. The piston traveling down on the intake stroke creates vacuum. Atmospheric pressure combined with vacuum forces more air and fuel into the cylinder at higher velocity<br><br>Intake valve actually closes After Bottom Dead Center (ABDC) during compression stroke because the cylinder is still a low pressure area, enabling atmospheric pressure to continue forcing in additional air and fuel. That, and inertia.<br><br>In most cars, the spark initiates while the piston is approximately 30-40 degrees (of crankshaft rotation) BTDC and the event of the spark can last roughly 3-7 degrees.<br><br>Although the air/fuel ratio is compressed to nearly spontaneous combustion, the burning mixture really doesn&#39;t start to increase the cylinder pressure until 10-15 degrees BTDC.<br><br>The entire fuel burn in a gasoline engine lasts roughly 60 degrees. The gasses are still expanding and creating pressure which is forcing the piston towards BDC.<br><br>Because we&#39;re talking about events which last for milliseconds, even at a low idle, and because there is still a small amount of pressure remaining in the cylinder, the exhaust valve begins to open several degrees BBDC.<br><br>The still expanding gasses with negligible pressures start to escape before the piston begins upward travel on the exhaust stroke.<br><br>The most efficient, non-performance engines achieve 70-80% volumetric efficiency meaning for every 10 cubic centimeters of cylinder area, only 7-8 cubic centimeters of air and fuel enter.<br><br>Quick mathematic side bar: The area of a circle is Pi*R^2 (Pie R Squared. To find the area of a cylinder, you then multiply that number by the length of the piston stroke (not the connecting rod).<br><br>If you have a 5 centimeter cylinder bore diameter, the radius is 2.500 centimeters<br><br>2.5*2.5=6.25<br>6.25*3.14159=19.6349375<br><br>If you multiply that number by a piston stroke distance of say 3 centimeters, you come up with displacement at 58.9 cubic centimeters<br><br>For the sake of argument, if we take 75% as our volumetric efficiency, we end up with an engine that inhales 44.178cc.<br><br>A &quot;violent&quot; or &quot;aggressive&quot; camshaft profile combined with carefully enlarged and smoothed out intake and exhaust ports and larger valves might increase that V.E. number to say 79-82% in a reliable build combination.<br><br>This is where boost comes into play:<br><br>If your engine crankshaft has a pulley on it, it can use a belt to drive a Supercharger AKA blower. It basically compresses and pressurizes a larger volume of air to force into the cylinder.<br><br>If your exhaust gasses pass over a turbine fan, the fan will spin on a shaft. If that shaft is supported on bearings and has an impeller aka compressor where on the opposite end, it can draw in and compress more air to be forced into the engine.<br><br>That&#39;s called a turbocharger.<br><br>In a boosted application, with everything else optimized for performance, you can see V.E. numbers significantly higher than 100%<br><br><br>Anyways, back to our lawnmower engine<br>This is a dinosaur design called a flat head. Obvious name. The combustion chamber includes the space above the valves which are located in the block.<br><br>A modern, so called over head valve design moves the valves into the head and directly over the piston. With the spark plug directly centered over the piston, the burn of the fuel and the pressure of the burn is directed over top of the cylinder. Far less milliseconds of burn time are wasted as the charge burns closer and closer to the piston.<br><br>Using a hemispherical (Hemi) combustion chamber maximizes this effect, fully directing the force of the combustion burn onto the crown of the piston.<br><br><br>@ me if you have questions.

Deflagration is what we want in an engine. It&#39;s a controlled burn with a flame front propagating at subsonic speeds. Detonation on the other hand is the flame front traveling at supersonic speeds. Detonation/knock/pinging can be caused by high compression coupled with too low of octane fuel (octane is a fun topic...RON vs MON vs AKI...), carbon deposits generating hot spots (and also raising compression), spark issues, etc. The basic problem with detonation is that the energy of the fuel is released too rapidly. It&#39;s pretty much like hitting the piston with a hammer which is damaging to the piston, rings rods, main bearings, heck even the cylinder head and block could be damaged!<br><br>So yeah, dont think of a bunch of little explosions going &quot;bang bang bang&quot; in your engine but more &quot;woosh.&quot; Also, consider at only 3,000 RPM your pistons are going up and down 50 times per second and the whole process is happening 25 times per second per cylinder in your vehicle. Even at idle, it&#39;s probably turning around 13 times per second.

It may be geeky hair-splitting, but I figure you\u2019re the kinda guy who\u2019d want to know.  So, here goes:<br><br>You repeatedly refer to the combustion event as an explosion.  Well, it\u2019s not.  My Mechanical Engineering doctorate was in combustion science, in case you need a credibility check.  Technically, the flame in the engine cylinder, the potato gun, and etc. is a DEFLAGRATION, not a DETONATION.  And the latter is what we mean by an \u201cexplosion.\u201d  <br><br>What\u2019s the difference?  In a deflagration, the speed at which the flame front propagates is subsonic; for a detonation, it\u2019s supersonic.   The shockwave associated with a detonation comes with an overpressure behind it, and it\u2019s that overpressure that has the, um, explosive force.  That\u2018s why explosions blow out windows, knock people off their feet, and so on.  In a deflagration, the subsonic propagation of the flame front doesn\u2019t cause any of that; it\u2019s a whole lot MILDER of an event.  And that\u2019s what we want in an engine!  <br><br>If you\u2019re wondering, (because I know you\u2019re that kinda guy, too!) deflagrations CAN transition to detonations, if conditions are right.  That never happens in an engine to my knowledge, though.  No shockwave, no explosion.  Just smooth (albeit rapid) subsonic propagation fo the flame front across / through the combustion chamber.<br><br>Hope you found this useful!", "comment_date": "2019-05-11T23:45:41Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Aneizi", "comment_text": "What about electric engines?", "comment_date": "2019-05-11T22:30:46Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Toppu", "comment_text": "So basically the sound of a motor roaring is a series of explosions?", "comment_date": "2019-05-11T22:10:50Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Uuhhhhhhh", "comment_text": "Dustin: &quot;You&#39;re familiar with that roar \u2014 when the engine comes to life...&quot;<br><br>Me, a 15 year old: .....yEaH sUrE aLL thE TiMe", "comment_date": "2019-05-11T22:10:33Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "mostafa binali", "comment_text": "this vid tells us how the engine burns the feul .. but how the engine converts this burning into wheels moving ????", "comment_date": "2019-05-11T20:54:19Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Georg", "comment_text": "It&#39;s a combustion, not an explosion.

The fuel in a correctly running internal combustion engine does not explode! It burns. There is a significant difference. In older cars sometimes you would hear engine knock under hard acceleration. That&#39;s the fuel air mixture exploding. If it happens often enough it typically breaks the pistons by punching a hole in the top of them and then you need a new engine. The pistons are not the only part that gets damaged, they&#39;re just the first ones to fail. You never hear knock in newer cars since the introduction of knock sensors and electronic engine management systems. In the portion of the video that shows the single cylinder engine running in slow motion you can clearly see the flame front starting where the spark occurs and spreading across the combustion chamber and on into the cylinder. It&#39;s a perfect example of a controlled burn. Even the animation shows the flame front starting at the spark plug and propagating into the combustion chamber and then on into the cylinder.

But ;)  running engine on propane LPG does not make your engine last longer although here in Europe cost half compere to petrol.  Problem is propane burns slower so exhaust valve opens when gas still burns that burns the valve and valve seat that leads to  VSR - Valve Seat Recession. To reduce VSR lpg converted cars use valve lubricants like flashlube,  JLM but it is not actually 100% proven that those real works.  Key to success is often lpg instalation servicing and making sure that system does not run lean.

Simple thing the burning process takes long to efficient brun everything and you lose a lot of power from the explosion and last you will probably burn or damage the piston thats why he used propane and afterwards i know gasoline.

I asked a question in their comments that might be beyond their scope. I&#39;m hoping you can help me out here Destin. <br><br>I&#39;ve been thinking about hydrogen powered internal combustion engines for a while now. They would burn clean, creating power and water that can be reclaimed and electrolyzed into hydrogen and oxygen to start the whole process over again. I understand back when internal combustion engines were first created that this was tried, but the chamber remained too hot, and the hydrogen combusted too soon, creating backfires. Since then, we have improved the efficiency of engines many times over in terms of power versus weight. What if we increased the number of strokes on an engine from 4, intake, compression, power, exhaust, to 8, intake (fuel), compression, power, exhaust, intake (water), exhaust, intake (water again), exhaust. All 3 exhaust strokes would output to a holding tank for water where it would be electrolyzed the next time the vehicle &quot;fuels up&quot; at a charging station. The water intake strokes would pull from the same holding tank. I mentioned the efficiency of engines, because I  realize this would take more cylinders than what we&#39;re currently used to just to work at all. I&#39;m not a mechanic, but I think that means it would need 8 cylinders minimum to power something small like a 2-door commuter vehicle, where a four stroke would only need 4 cylinders. What do you think, would that work? Would that cool the piston compartment enough to keep the hydrogen from spontaneously combusting? Do we gain enough from burning clean fuel to account for the loss of efficiency? <br><br>For background, I live in an area where electricity turning a motor, simply doesn&#39;t cut it. Electric vehicles lack the power needed to go up steep, unpaved terrain, especially when said terrain is coated with 6-30 inches of snow. Besides, not everybody wants or can use a small commuter vehicle.  People still buy trucks because they need that versatility and power. Electric vehicles haven&#39;t even begun to look into meeting that demand. I&#39;m hoping a hydrogen-powered internal combustion engine can present the best of both worlds. <br><br>If you really read all of this, thank you.

Two: During the exhaust stroke, you can see the exhaust gasses rush out when the valve opens. However, the efficiency of that behavior will be different at different engine RPMs, Internal combustion engines are essentially air pumps, and pumps have an ideal operating RPM. It is possible to time not only the spark, but the opening and closing of the intake and exhaust valve to alter the timing of the engine to make it more efficient at lower or higher RPMs. The term used is cylinder intake and exhaust &quot;scavenging&quot;: the air fuel mixture coming into the engine has a certain velocity (and mass).. the shape and length of the intake passage, and the temperature of the air/fuel mixture will determine at what RPM the cylinder scavenges most efficiently on the intake stroke; likewise the exhaust gas temperature, exhaust passage shape and length will determine at what RPM the cylinder scavenges most efficiently on the exhaust stroke. Matching the optimum intake and exhaust scavenging to the same RPM will have the engine perform dramatically more efficiently (and run cleaner to boot) at that RPM. There are a lot more nuances to engine performance... countless man and machine hours have been spent on this subject. It is fascinating to see it happen before your very eyes.

Thanks. One small nit on the repeated use of the work &quot;explosion&quot; to describe the beginning of the power stroke. This is more accurately described as a combustion event. Understanding this as &quot;combustion&quot; helps understand the thermo dynamics of the 4 stroke engine. The combustion of the fuel air mixture is initiated by a spark that rapidly heats the air in the combustion chamber. Your awesome high speed video shows a controlled flame front moving starting at the spark and propagating through the combustion chamber. The heated air expands, pushing the piston down and is still expanding slightly as the exhaust valve opens...which is why you see the hot gases rushing out the moment the exhaust valve cracks open. The exhaust stroke then completes the job of pushing out the spent products of combustion.
