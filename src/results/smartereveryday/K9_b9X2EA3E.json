I live in Texas, US &amp; I\u2019ve never seen a kangaroo but we do have wild deer <b>everywhere</b> which these kangaroos remind me of a little.

You\u2019ve heard the phrase, \u201cyou look like a deer trapped in headlights\u201d because deers freeze (at first) when they see a human, or a car (headlights) then they bolt. The only time I\u2019ve touched one was when a mother deer was \u201ccrying\u201d (out loud) because her baby was trapped behind our yards fence. So we gently grabbed the baby deer &amp; handed him over the fence to its mom. I wish deer were this friendly, then again that would make it easier for hunters to get them. \ud83d\ude15 Kangaroos &amp; koalas are so cute.

In other words, sacrifice one and save others.<br><br>And lastly, I don&#39;t see the guy being cruel or anything. And I don&#39;t see the Kangaroo being uncomfortable.

I have made a Kangaroo character and I had named him Joie, which is a little tidbit type of thing considering that baby Kangaroos are called joeys. I had also believed that a Kangaroo&#39;s pouch was much like the pocket on a pair of jeans and that it was across the belly. I thought this way because of Roo&#39;s mom from &quot;Winnie The Pooh&quot;, as her pouch is across her belly and looks kind of like it would be similar to that of a jeans pocket. I now know that this is a fallacion, or false fact, that many people believe and/or have misconceptions about what a Kangaroo&#39;s pouch actually looks like when compared to the ones most, if not all of us, have seen in cartoons as children and/or with a child while either babysitting or just having a relaxing day with a younger family member. I thank you for uploading this video as it is quite informative as is and shows that a Kangaroo&#39;s pouch is not as large as we thought it was due to cartoons showing the pouches across the Kangaroo&#39;s belly. Again, I thank you for uploading this video. On a bit of a side note, you have gained yourself a new Subscriber!
