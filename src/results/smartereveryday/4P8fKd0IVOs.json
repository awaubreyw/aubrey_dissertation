There is, though, one thing about JWST that I really didn&#39;t see anyone explain yet. That is how much of the sky will JWST be able to point to at any given time. Obviously it will have to keep the sunshield facing the sun every time, making the visible portion of the sky variable through the year.

Time is not a force or law with any power.\u00a0<br><br>Light delivers an instantaneous picture across the universe. We knew this decades ago but the government had stated that they did not want it known. I have found a way that you can prove this for yourself easily. If our galaxy is moving at 1.3 million miles an hour it is also moving at 361.11111 miles a second. The problem is that that velocity would cause a divergence of 0.109-degrees or 1.1 inches over fifty feet or more or less depending on where the earth is in orbit around the sun and how its rotation would affect those numbers. I have not found anyone that will discuss this and I know you like uncovering interesting things. The government had come out and said that they would hide the secret of the Hiroshima bomb,, and that would require hiding the particles that power the bomb. Particles of electricity cross the entire universe in the blink of an eye. When you slow them down you get a sun, a bomb, gravity, x-rays, UV, light, heat, and movement. This is not a conspiracy because they came out and told us. Most of my teachers and professors walked away from teaching. They use a laser beam to prove the velocity of light but a laser beam is not light, it is a beam of atoms that are fluorescing. It takes time to bring atoms to a point they fluoresce. Sunlight does not create a visible beam of light in a totally dark room if there is no dust in the room. <br><br>But check out my math on how much a 0.109-degree divergence caused by the velocity of our galaxy would alter a laser beam.", "comment_date": "2021-12-29T15:50:26Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Bloons that works", "comment_text": "These wavelengths go to 11", "comment_date": "2021-12-29T14:01:11Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Narayanan", "comment_text": "@<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4P8fKd0IVOs&amp;t=18m40s\">18:40</a> the test equipment for simulating vacuum and temperature - how does the effect of gravity can be removed?

My Mom once changed her flight booking to a 4 hour layover on purpose through Newark for her flight from Denver to Geneva because she was worried her bags wouldn&#39;t make her connecting flight on the regularly scheduled 2 hour layover. She also stressed out about her bags for the 3 months leading up to the flight. This got us talking about the need to only worry about things she can control (like setting 2 alarms clocks to ensure you wake up on time for the flight), and maybe also worrying about things &quot;within your circle of influence&quot; (like being friendly to the driver of the airport shuttle van in hopes that he&#39;ll help you out in case things go wrong), and definitely NOT worrying about things that are OUTSIDE of this circle of influence (which is outside of the circle of control). Life is too short to worry about things outside of your circle of influence (like worrying if it&#39;s going to rain tomorrow). What you can control is whether or not you have an umbrella ready, and if it rains, then it rains, and you&#39;re ready for it. Great video by the way.

It seems that this satellite, just like all other satellites, will be mounted on a platform hanging from a high altitude\u00a0balloon that supplies the power needed for its operation. As you saw in the videos, the builders are able to lift the 6+ tons satellite\u00a0by holding it to its one side, which means this is not a design for\u00a0weightless\u00a0structure, but is a design to hold the satellite\u00a0by its mounting bracket.", "comment_date": "2021-12-19T18:51:02Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Tom Legrady", "comment_text": "So 26 years to build something with a ten year life expectancy", "comment_date": "2021-12-19T18:36:07Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "David Tighe", "comment_text": "You would probably be interested in Stoicism, or mindfulness meditation.

I can honestly say that the main reason that Dr. Mather is so calm in all this is that absolutely everything has been scrutinized in making this observatory come to life.  My job was to take pretty much every engineers input, including my own, on what could fail with the sunshield material and then determine a way to prove that it wouldn&#39;t be a major failure mechanism in the target mission life.  This was by far the most challenging but oh so rewarding program I will work on in my lifetime for sure.   I unfortunately left before flight hardware was being integrated, but it is something I am very proud and humbled to have been able to be a part of.  I know this mission will succeed because there are so many very talented, smart and dedicated people that have worked on it over the past 20+ years.  I can not wait to see what it teaches us as it should be quite literally jaw dropping.  (As a side note, I was critiqued long ago by Dr. Mather in some design reviews and his presence, humbleness, and insights are exactly what you get in this interview.  It also was indicative of all of the main NASA scientists and engineers.

It is proposed that we will find that all brown dwarf stars are actually gas giant size bodies enclosed in their own huge plasma sheath which appears as a red anode glow. This will point to the electrical nature of stars as per the E.U. paradigm, and provide a single explanation for the numerous variety and class categories now required to describe brown dwarfs and other stars. It will reveal ( confirm) the existence of the connecting network of helically twisted filamentary pairs and braids of plasma, everywhere we look. It is predicted that the Webb telescope will show that highly red shifted quasars are not at the edge of the visible universe but are ejected in pairs from their parent galaxies in our neighbourhood and beyond.

Speed of light is constant, it does not depend on the relative motion of the objects. Red shift is caused by the expansion of space.

It&#39;s not like stars on one side of a distant spiral galaxy have their light shifted a different amount then stars on the other side just because they happen to be moving towards or away from us. The light is red shifted because space is stretching and the light is stretching with that space as it travels through it.<br><br>Also, not that this was said, but the emphasis that the star moving away from us causes the red shift has to make one think that a star moving towards us would cause a blue shift?

I would like to hear something more about the red shift. The analogy of sound and the doppler shift putting the departing sound into a lower register is well understood to most anyone with ears, and seems at first glance to work as an illustration. Perhaps it does. But sound changes speed in several ways; through different media (almost twice as fast in water), and then from the departing source. could you hear direct sound from a plane departing at the speed of sound? Would light really act in the same way as sound? If it moves slower in relationship to us when sent from a departing source, isn&#39;t it really possible that light does not have a single speed? But if it doesn&#39;t move slower, then how an there be red shift? What if two light sources were EACH moving at more than half of the speed of light away from each other would ; would the light be slower as each saw it? Would it be visible at all? Seems to me that an interesting experiment that could be done in this regard would be to send two nuclear electric plasma engine rockets in opposite directions for a year with their lights on, and just measure the frequencies between them.  I&#39;d also like to see light experiments using two sensors connected to a third, equidistant, time regulation broadcaster, to eliminate the variable of the timer in light speed measurements.

The reality we are in here and now isn&#39;t real in the way we think it is. It&#39;s real because we believe it&#39;s real and all there is, but there is a shocking bigger picture. Peoples heads might literally explode if they suddenly could comprehend what this bigger picture is, it is that shocking. I could never <del>fully</del> believe in an optimistic worldview like this with all the apparent suffering in nature - animal suffering, how could a loving &quot;god&quot; setup a world with that going on. I&#39;m just going to blatantly say it: I&#39;ve figured it out. This reality is the most elaborate prank of all time, setup to make us believe we are something we are not. &quot;mother nature&quot; is no different whatsoever than any human made technology, it is &quot;manmade&quot; technology in fact. No &quot;God&quot; exists that created the plants, animals, cell, human bodies even. Nope it&#39;s just mere technology INTENTIONALLY SETUP TO MAKE IT LOOK LIKE BENEVOLENT OUTSIDE INTELLIGENCE DOESN&#39;T EXIST. That is all. everything we learn in science about evolution and our history of having evolved from animals, or religious fairy tales like the garden of Eden, are just cover stories to hide what is actually going on. There is no such thing as death, conscious death, we aren&#39;t bodies but have been forced into believing we are, we are in fact something FAR FAR more than mere bodies. Genuine consciousness is the only real value thing in all existence. It has been unfairly farmed through our suffering for the benefit of the power brokers ruling this world. It is allowed to happen like this, because it also serves as the ULTIMATE test of true character and true love.

Just about every youtube video about redshift, including those mentioning Albert Einstein insist on mentioning redshift in the most rudimentary explanation.  The fact is that redshift measurements involve very precise metrology.<br><br>So, what I assume you would enjoy and it is a rather inexpensive project, is building a spectrograph.  Only here we have a need for a spectrograph with a little bit of a twist.  Your youtube spectrograph should be able to measure a sample in your lab and measure a comparison material while looking down a telescope SIMULTANEOUSLY!  Both images should be measured on the same CCD or piece of film at the same time.   Then the results can be measured and the results directly compared over long periods of time.

Ever since I got interested in it, I realised that some of the people involved in the project have been working on this for years and years and I could never really stop worrying about the fact that rockets tend to fail some of the time and if they do, there is nothing you can do to save the payload. I could only imagine the heartache of losing something you spent years of your life working on to some kind of probably minute failure ending catastrophically. I have the utmost respect for John Mather for actually convincing me that at least one person who has been on this project since the beginning is not fearful of the launch but rather calm and collected towards what will happen, either way.

Not disambiguating between mass and force is kinda understandable, since gravity is (to a small tolerance) equal everywhere we live.
