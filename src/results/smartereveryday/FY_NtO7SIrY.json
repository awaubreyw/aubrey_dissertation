[{"comment_by": "SmarterEveryDay", "comment_text": "This is the third video in a series I&#39;m doing on social media manipulation.   Facebook is an extremely interesting case to study.  They&#39;re the largest social media platform in the world and one could argue they&#39;ve felt the pain of this stuff more than any other platform.  I find it to be EXTREMELY interesting that they&#39;re transitioning to an ACTIVE position on misinformation as opposed to REACTIVE.  I think it&#39;s super easy for the public to dismiss what facebook says because of their branding/trust issues.... but regardless of what you think about the company, they are one of the most attacked platforms in the world. Therefore, they&#39;re the most experienced people at countering this threat.  At times it seems like they&#39;re getting their butts kicked, and at others it seems like they&#39;re winning. Facebook is not blameless, but directing all of our conversational energy towards the platform itself avoids a major issue, namely the people using the platform to do harm, or to inauthentically promote/discredit something.<br><br><br>The case of the fitness coach was disturbing.  This is a well-known individual with millions of followers.  She was clearly benefitting from inauthentic followers and commenters. Someone sympathetic to her clearly wrote the comments. The evidence was very damning in my opinion.... but ultimately I made the decision to blur our her page because attribution is difficult. What if someone purchased face comments on Smarter Every Day and said nice things, then framed me as the one who bought the comments? These are the types of things that undermine the very notion of social media integrity. <br><br><br>Another thought here. If you don&#39;t use facebook, you may be tempted to leave an anti-facebook comment.  Totally cool.  I&#39;m not a heavy facebook user myself. I don&#39;t post my videos to facebook often because of their intellectual property policies. That being said, I&#39;ve noticed that the tone of many of these comments has a &quot;superiority&quot; feel to them, with most of the disdain directed at the platform facebook itself.  I think this is extremely interesting because its possible platform manipulation has affected how you feel about these platforms themselves. The people I met are trying very hard to make a high integrity platform, but it&#39;s clear they are fighting a huge corrupt industry, and in some cases a literal disinformation war. My language will be more charitable in the future.", "comment_date": "2019-04-24T19:06:43Z", "likes_count": 1021}, {"comment_by": "Owen Lawson", "comment_text": "It&#39;s awesome to see how invested these social media workers are at taking down these fake users!

Who is manipulating Facebook is Facbook!!! I know this video is a couple years old so You didnt know anything that was about to come out about FB spying on everyone and manipulating the posts and comments of everyone and especially teen girls were made to think their friends and family didnt care so it made them depressed so they stayed on facebook longer which tried to make them More depressed and girls started killing themselves and Facebook knew it and didnt stop it. Even after testifying on Capitol Hill about this, They havent changed any of it. Theyre still spying or &quot;Peeping&quot; on your Daughters and GrandDaughters  and Congress isnt going to do a darn thing. WTF? My grandkids are not allowed on facebook. In my mind all those Facebook assisted suicides constitute &quot;Depraved Indifference to Human Life&quot; which is the same as wrongful death or  attempted murder.

All of these &quot;enthusiastic&quot; managers of &quot;truth in posting&quot; that you interviewed, in my opinion, apparently presented a very one-sided propaganda front as if their org has our best interests at heart.  Clearly after this stolen election, I hope you see that they don&#39;t.  MZ &amp; Twitt banning our own President from using their own Platform, when there is clear evidence of election tampering.<br>.<br>What should&#39;ve been the dead-giveaway for yourself, even back in 2019, was MZ&#39;s long-standing admission that he&#39;s basically an atheistic or agnostic.  As you should know from John 2:22 &quot;Who rejects the Christ is a liar&quot;, and we&#39;ve seen repeated Lies in public, his promises to protect privacy, not sell our data, etc etc.  Probably the most accurate thing you have in this vid is the Catholic concept of Sin of Omission...just by doing nothing, they &quot;allowed&quot; genocide to allegedly happen in Myanmar.  I remember the days when I had access to # of planes etc that Burma had, and their status as a &quot;rogue State&quot;.  Well, the Rogue State has long been Within....JFK was right, there really is a 5th column Right Here.  <br>.<br>And it began long b4 They also financed the Protestant Reform, bc their Book tells them to &quot;divide Christian against Christian&quot; and to &quot;kill them all, enslave them&quot; etc.  So how is it that you can trust these owned Platforms, Goog / Amzn / Wikimedia / Aapl / Disn included, when you know that they are run by Execs who tend to have an ancient history of antagonism against Christianity itself?  In short, this entire interview seems, in retrospect, naive...yet-another Engineer, who hasn&#39;t had enough Humanities / History preparation perhaps?  No worries bro, even my own EE studies, woefully inadequate by denying us the True History &amp; Econ lessons, such that I had to learn these &quot;other&quot; things on my own, at the expense of becoming a better Engineer.  <br>.<br>A stronger Citizen will be well-grounded in the Theology / History / Metaphysics first, from a young age, before learning the Engineering &amp; Sciences later.  Why?  Because there is too much brainwash at stake...we must learn how to Discern Truth before we could adequately study anything else...because who knows what other BRAINWASH they will throw into our Science textbooks as well, which try to get us to reject that there even is a God?  (See the Global Warming propaganda today, forced upon every subject nowadays, using faked science including &quot;Evolution&quot;, and &quot;Scarcity&quot;, which is directly contradictory to &quot;Intelligent Design&quot; and &quot;Abundance&quot; taught since Genesis).  As I said in your other video Parker Solar Probe, we need grounding in Faith AND Reason first, before we can safely tackle Empirical Reasoning (and vice versa).  Otherwise, we&#39;ll never know if we&#39;re being brainwashed or fooled (as you were apparently here by their Staff).  <br>.<br>All modern science relies upon unprovable Axioms taken on Faith (such as Euclid&#39;s parallel lines never intersecting out to Infinity, which no one to date has proven).  So why is it that you have committed Sins of Omission by allowing Them to attack our Faith?  Slander our Crusades and &quot;Inquisitions&quot; as if they were for &quot;no reason&quot;, etc?  Wikimedia censoring any editors from modifying their Fortress-Guarded Articles like Intelligent Design, as if we Creationists are a bunch of whackos, or as if a Patrick Byrne (CEO and Wall Street Whistleblower) is a whacko merely for exposing corrupt Short Selling culture in NYC?<br>.<br>Why do you even trust Them?  Well, for one, They financed the Reform.  So ever since Henry VIII &amp; John Calvin, none of you were taught that Usury is insidiously bad, or that They financed the Reform, specifically to restore Usury and get Christians to eliminate one another for them.  So you&#39;ve been denied Truth, to turn us into sheeple.  Hopefully after this &quot;Election&quot;, you have seen what They can do, and no longer trust them.  I hope you help turn the tables on Them.  Look up Tim Berniers-Lee&#39;s new Internet Platform, to help us all achieve the Freedom &amp; Truther-movement you talked about here.  He too is disgusted by Them taking over our Media, Manufactured GroupThink.  No more Sin of Omission plz.  Mat 18--expose them.

I totally agree with you, or at least what I believe you to be saying, that at our core as a society we are dealing with a heart problem.  We no longer as a country can have a robust exchange of ideas of opposing view points without one or both parties involved becoming hostile over the discussion.  The problem I have with platforms like Twitter (although I&#39;ve never used it), Facebook (which I have left for reasons I&#39;ll state here in a moment) and youtube (which I may not be on much longer for the same reasons to yet be mentioned) is simple.  In their effort to combat the bad actors on their platforms they are also silencing people whose opinions and viewpoints they don&#39;t agree with.  I want to be careful here though because I&#39;m not sure yet if this &quot;silencing&quot; is corporate mandated or the action of a subset of employees.  Either one is bad.  This is, in my mind, just more evidence of how our society has gone from the realization that we have no rights to not be offended to one where a large segment of our society thinks they do have a right to not hear, read or see something that they deem offensive.  For example, just because President Trump is notorious for being flamboyant and crass does not mean he doesn&#39;t have a right to free speech.  We as individuals need to exercise our common sense to filter what he says and understand that he has a right to say it and as long as these platforms feed into this false idea of a &quot;right to not be offended&quot; they are just as much part of the problem as the nation state actors that are trying to fuel division in our country.", "comment_date": "2020-12-28T21:02:07Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "JJ", "comment_text": "Define foment", "comment_date": "2020-12-27T20:41:39Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "TheXanUser", "comment_text": "I have a very unique name that facebook thinks is fake.

The average person then is stuck with the immensely crucial responsibility of sifting through everything and making an informed and educated decision. But knowing the average person, they won&#39;t take such lengths to do so. It seems the internet is truly a lost cause then on that front unless we start utilizing more stringent methods of control, which will alarm a lot of people because the States value independence and freedom over everything. Just look at the protests going on during the Covid-19 lockdowns, people would rather endanger the lives of others and go out about their lives.

And tons of people shared and commented how bad that was and how they should be taken down a peg and shut down etc. I was about to share but then I thought and looked them up I found no videos online I also found no reviews on any site (I know they&#39;re new but if they had the monster of all worst experiences you&#39;d thing someone would have at least tweeted it.) No one other then this poster showed up in any of the searches I did and the only reviews were from a completely different location which had mostly good reviews anyway. so I commented this saying we should share until we get proof and I had nothing but people calling me stupid and an idiot for doing the research and stain there&#39;s no proof. All the responses I got were from cherry picked reviews from the wrong location and more people claiming things they couldn&#39;t prove like the company deleting negative reviews online (but if there was evidence which came first the girl claiming wrong doing or the company deleting bad reviews people could have been so pationate about the post that a few of them could have been doxing  the company with bad reviews.) The fact I even claimed that there was no evidence to prove the accusation was taboo I&#39;m the worst for defending scumbags and such. So this is even a bit worse then what you&#39;ve been talking about Destin everyone is defending accusations and harming a local buisiness simply over how they feel about the story told.

Government manipulation isn&#39;t new, knowing about it is. The problem isn&#39;t the manipulation, that&#39;s always existed, the problem is trying to stop it with... More government. Which is government manipulation.<br><br>All the major social media platforms are being manipulated by governments, either through regulations or through subsidizations. It&#39;s in their best interests to comply, but if you think they&#39;re acting in a free market, you&#39;re ignorant or delusional.<br><br>The next innovation is blockchain social media. Governments will try and manipulate the content like they have always done, but they won&#39;t have the ability to censor it. The way to combat false speech is with more speech. Governments and nefarious actors can salt discussions with false information and noise, they try and control both sides of the conversation, with misinformation and misinformation about the misinformation to discredit the truth.<br>Alex Jones is the famous example. Yes he&#39;s a wack nut conspiracy theorist, but he&#39;s not as wacky as most people think. By showcasing his most wacky moments and lying about the rest they salt his content with noise, but the reality is most of his content is ranting about what he reads from mainstream news sources and he doesn&#39;t take many wacky positions himself. Unless You actually watch his content, you&#39;d think he&#39;s responsible for the Sandy Hook conspiracies, but he&#39;s not, he got that from mainstream news and then recanted it shortly after. When you realize how much of the mainstream narrative is a conspiracy, everything looks like a conspiracy. The main stream news has dozens of openly known deep state operatives working for them, and the mainstream news pushed the Sandy Hook conspiracies which Alex Jones picked up which the mainstream news used to discredit him and he was even sued over even though he didn&#39;t hold those views for a long time.<br><br>It&#39;s a conspiracy theory sure, but the facts all point to the misinformation coming from one source, U.S. government misinformation.<br><br>The truth is hard to find, but it&#39;s not hard to verify official narratives are false. The U.S. government engages in propaganda campaigns as well, many of which have lead to the deaths of millions of people. The U.S. government isn&#39;t the good guy. That doesnt mean people working in the government are bad people, but it&#39;s a natural consequence of centralized power. The U.S. was supposed to be a federation not a nation. Nationalization of power in the US violates the constitution, making the federal government (which is no longer federal, it&#39;s national) illegal. The level of corruption isn&#39;t even hidden, it&#39;s obfuscated by tribal adherence to country.<br><br>&quot;The beginning of wisdom starts with calling things by their true name.&quot;<br><br>Blockchain is peer to peer, the only way to censor it is to shut off the internet.

Thank you for making the effort to travel and interview people at these social media companies. I believe the very best way to combat propaganda, misinformation, and disinformation campaigns online (launched by any malicious organization foreign or domestic) is <b>better</b> <b>funded</b> <b>public</b> <b>education</b> that better prepares all people (children and adults) for the latest challenges in the domain of information warfare by teaching strong critical thinking and media literacy skills. No matter where you live, if a significant portion of the population is ill-informed and easily manipulated, then the very fabric of democracy is frayed. Better public education is the most important action nations can take to protect their citizens, but that needs to be supplemented by apolitical, rational, evidence-based, scientific assessment of social media and the modern media and information technology landscape. After it is thoroughly investigated and assessed by a large number of independent experts, scientists, organizations, and agencies, the findings of this research need to be used to develop the most helpful and effective regulatory legislation that will curtail the negative social influence of information warfare online. The results of the aforementioned mass research initiatives must also be used to provide concrete, actionable solutions to not only prevent and deter information warfare online, but to enable military and law enforcement agencies to take a proactive role in combating propaganda and manipulation on the Internet by strategically targeting offending groups and nations after deep digital reconnaissance and evidence-gathering. Finally, all of these efforts must be championed by elected leaders and all types of politicians, because right now the conservative/Republican factions in power in the U.S. and parts of Europe, are doing the absolute minimum to counter foreign adversarial information warfare campaigns as they foolishly believe they will continue to benefit themselves in the long-term, like they were benefited in 2016. Genuine, intelligent, and charismatic leadership is needed right now, across the democratic world, to prevent the total collapse of Western civilization as designed by malicious groups, primarily in the Russian sphere of influence.", "comment_date": "2019-05-28T02:32:59Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "shahar 123", "comment_text": "Literally eye-opening", "comment_date": "2019-05-27T14:44:26Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Victor Hugo", "comment_text": "I think iam not alone when i say i don&#39;t trust a single word coming from Facebook", "comment_date": "2019-05-27T14:40:11Z", "likes_count": 14}, {"comment_by": "Ciggo Smoke'O Doggo", "comment_text": "Lol what I find funny is that by trying to combat minipulation they are minipulating you as a user.", "comment_date": "2019-05-27T06:54:11Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Dr. Ed Kendrick", "comment_text": "Zionists\u2014\u201cKosher Nostra\u201d (SPLC).

Around 2000 years ago God chose a man named Yeshua to tell his people the Isra&#39;elites that they had locked the gates of heaven by teaching their own man made religion based on their own oral laws that we now call the talmud. This man Yeshua,  the son born to Mary left what we call the matthew gospel and it contains all the light and the way to repent and return to God. The leaders and pharisees did not want to give up their hierarchy and so they got rid of the thorn in their side and joined the world. As soon as God took the teacher Yeshua up and let them have the delusion of killing him they immediately with satans help sent out the false christ writings to lead everyone away from God and into deep sin. It has gone so far today that satan has christians hating God&#39;s commandments that Yeshua himself told his followers are the only way to eternal life. <br>You&#39;ve all been tricked into worship of the false christ the beast came up with and its idolatrous cross. Yes I am very sad to tell you that the jesus that was hammered through the world by Rome is the false christ that leads all its people to reject God and his EVERLASTING eternal laws that free us from all sin when we absolutely obey them and God then heals us.<br>With satans Jesus you are freed from the punishment of sin and from serving God. It is the opposite of what Yeshua taught while there alive.<br>He only left the Matthew gospel, that is his wheat and what came with the bloody cross is the weeds the poison of a bloody murder.<br>I know most christians don&#39;t mean to serve the name and image the beast offers them and that is why God has stayed judgement till our time when every man can look and see what God actually taught his people and choose who you will serve now that you know the truth. <br>They killed God&#39;s teacher,  they killed his commandments and so far they keep all the world dead in their sins.<br>You can come out of sin and be free with God by showing him he is first and making the ten commandments your foundation. <br>Have you not ever wondered why the matthew gospel teaches what God always taught and then after they think they murdered his messenger then all sin breaks loose? You as a christian never change from what you were which is commandment breaker.<br>Ask and God will help you.<br>\ud83d\ude01<br>Peace to you all", "comment_date": "2019-05-06T22:26:56Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "SunnyDisposition", "comment_text": "Facebook has created a public utility not unlike the telephone.

They alter the algorithms on their platforms to serve and promote their agenda and maximize their profits. They also have their own cognitive biases just like everyone else. Being an engineer myself I have personally seen AI algorithms being fed data to favor certain outcomes; engineers doing this claim they are removing social biases. In essence they are now seeding future AI to support their worldview. You can all guess on what side of the political spectrum these data scientists and engineers fall.

When does this manipulation on Facebook&#39;s side make Facebook a publisher responsible for the content published on their site? I see that manipulation is a problem on Facebook, but I am afraid of the solution which makes Facebook the great arbiter declaring one thing dangerous and another thing good. If a group posts things that are contrary to the values that Facebook has but are not inciting violence or pornographic, what is to stop Facebook from saying it is dangerous and we are going to hide this from the public? If they are the gate keepers it seems like they are liable as a company for what is on their site and it is no longer an open platform. This legally would be a steep cliff for Facebook. Even taking one small example of copyright photos. As a publisher Facebook could be sued for every photo posted that infringes the copyright protection.

If you cannot take an honest and reasonable look at all aspects of your experience (including the thing we were all taught not to question - our religion), then watching videos like this is not helpful as you won&#39;t recognize your biases and miss important information due to that. <br><br>I&#39;m always the most interested in the theists that have a strong scientific base. These are the most interesting simply because the acrobatics the mind must do to balance this out is incredible. Unless the person has just not put any thought in to their religious beliefs and just accepted them - then I suppose the conflict can be departmentalized. This, however, is even more disappointing as it&#39;s intellectually lazy and just as damaging as blindly liking or sharing something on FB.", "comment_date": "2019-04-28T15:59:05Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "bahgheera", "comment_text": "As a bot, I think this video is great.", "comment_date": "2019-04-28T13:34:04Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Magnus Vestergaard", "comment_text": "2FA is also an amazing way to verify that you&#39;re a human, or at least to prevent people from stealing your account.

They should live within their means.  The pastor then went on to describe several of the methods that are used to convince people to spend money on things they don&#39;t need.  Then the pastor informed people that they should be saving that money instead of spending it, stating that the first 10% of their monthly income should go to your retirement savings.  At this point, I was a bit shocked.  Such a good positive message.  I thought I had found a church I could feel good about being a member of.  THEN it happened.  Next the pasture proceeded to use the exact tactics he warned people about to say that after the first 10% of their income was for their own savings that the next 10% should be given to the church.

Fact checking on the ground and not by very political biased agencies as is now (watch &quot;the lobby&quot;).

This is when things started getting crazy.<br><br><br>Straight away I knew that my password for my email had been compromised. I had a really good, long password so I found it strange that it had been hacked. I immediately changed my password on my back-up email and then tried to change my password for my main through the help of Google.<br><br><br>I finally got back into my account and in 10 minutes, they had changed my profile picture, and made 6 posts of half naked women telling people to click a link for Russian brides. Straight out of a movie.<br><br><br>The crazy thing is, when I got back in, I had noticed that they had tried to hack my account again WHILE I WAS USING IT! Only after about 40 mins of fighting I finally got my account back and it seems to have been okay since. <br><br><br>After that experience, I have put 2 factor authentication on every single account I own, and removed any stored login details from any site I have ever visited.<br><br><br>The world is a scary place ever since they realised they could target you with your own devices and you wouldn&#39;t know a thing.", "comment_date": "2019-04-26T01:54:56Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "MrBillTroop73", "comment_text": "...this is very cool... but...

I often find myself reading what I think to be a relatively mild article on a political topic, only to scroll down and find a staggering number of negative comments in full opposition. While I understand that not everyone shares my views, it seems that the percentage of comments vehemently denouncing a concept or person is shockingly inconsistent with the actual spectrum of public opinion. I also get that those holding strong opinions are usually the most likely to voice them and that public opinion is particularly polarized at present, however I can\u2019t help but feel suspicious that this is another outlet for targeted manipulation that isn\u2019t often addressed. Did any of the experts you consulted with ever mention this platform? I consider it to be particularly harmful as those denouncing stories on local news sites are assumed to be actual neighbours and members of your community, so to find yourself in full opposition to their supposed views tempts the individual to make an emotional decision to blindly conform, without actually researching the facts.<br><br>In a similar vein, there was a fascinating article published on the BBC a few months ago titled \u2018The Godfather of Fake News\u2019.

AND I could get in just fine  <i>on that same supposedly infected system</i> to a second account I had previously created primarily to look a the health support groups as an outsider to see if the privacy settings were doing what they said they were. AND THEN there was the Public Library, I go there try to log in to FB and FB puts up notice they won&#39;t let me in because my system has malware - Wait a minute, THAT computer was NOT my system!!! Other people try to log in on same 3 computers at library and get in to FB just fine, me, no. Facebook also said I had to download an antimalware program via them before I could get back on. I hadn&#39;t heard of the one they were demanding, extorting?, so I went and looked it up. Found this product on PC Mag&#39;s website ---&gt; Oh, really, FB???? You can&#39;t tell me that you people do not know this program has issues.<br>&quot;Cons Very difficult installation on several test systems. Scan process rendered one system unbootable, requiring over a week to repair. No URL-level blocking of malicious websites.<br>    Bottom Line<br>    If you can guarantee you&#39;re installing it on a clean PC, F-Secure Anti-Virus 2014 can be a great choice. However, getting it to install and scan already-infested systems was a nightmare.&quot;<br>Anyway, at the same time FB was saying my system had malware, 5 anti-malware programs and an paid IT professional were saying it did not. BUT the deal at the library on the library computers revealed that the harassment by FB wasn&#39;t about my system, it was about ME!!!<br>Oh, I will tell about 1 other thing, in 2017 some friends finally got lucky and pushed the right buttons to try to talk me in to relenting and giving Facebook another try. So I did. Created a new accouont and was on for a few days then FB locked my account and said I had to give them a cellphone number for them to text me codes to use to log in with. Umm, <i>I didn&#39;t have a cellphone.</i> The thing which finally and fully soured me forever on Facebook was not that but rather it was Facebook&#39;s declaration that they would then post the number to my timeline but would keep it private and hidden.

Unfortunately facebook isn&#39;t hold accountable for the deaths that are indirectly caused (directly enabled) by their platform, and thus they&#39;re not directly considered in a financial cost-benefit analysis.

The issue I had seen were there was lots of fun events I missed that I didn&#39;t know about; so, I figured a town Facebook Group could address this.  I created one and it floundered (I am an Engineer, my social connection are quite limited); but, a couple of random sparks got it started.  One example was our Town Memorial Day Parade (which was the central annual town event).  It started raining, some of the instruments were getting wet, the parade hadn&#39;t started and nobody knew what was going on.  The next thing I knew my group was the that information source and it went viral (at least in my limited space).  <br><br>The Group is setup as in Open Group but with required membership approval.  I do this to keep out people that shouldn&#39;t be there.  I manage it using a simple set of published rules I created early on.  I only address issues when there is a clear violation of the stated rules.  The group is now 10 years old, I try my best to keep bad actors out.  Currently there are now about 12,000 members.

This alone would make it almost impossible for people to create more than 50 fake accounts because it would be too much of a hassle for them. Again, starting your account would be a one time thing basically requiring you to go into the station, give your name, show them an Id and then they would put the info into the system and from there give you all the access to your account so that you could now go back home and have access to facebook the rest of your life whenever you want ect.

One of the main crux&#39;s for me is that we are trying to fix a problem that is a symptom of the systems already in place. If we think about it, the internet has centralized itself into a few platforms like Facebook, Twitter, Reddit, etc whereas before these sites you had to go to individual forums to find information or opinions. One of the nice things about the centralization is that we all are on a few platforms and networking becomes super easy, but the problem is that we are all on these few platforms and dissemination of information has outpaced our ability to fight bad information. <br><br>It&#39;s a very interesting topic and I was super excited to see your video series pop up when I was in the earlier stages of my paper.

Facebook actively censored MUCH of what came out of Myanmar.  They censored the victims.  They censored anyone posting images of what was being done, anyone who posted videos of being attacked, etc.  Their desire to not show violence or gore and that sort of thing, to stick their heads in the sand and pretend the world is an advertiser-friendly milquetoast dystopia where no one is mean or sexual or any of the other human traits they&#39;ve decided to suppress, led to them (and will always lead to this) giving shelter to the genocidal madmen.<br><br>That &#39;changing the engagement that borderline content gets&#39; is a fancy way of saying that they are actively trying to manipulate cultural norms and to induce biases and specific viewpoints.  The example given is an excellent one.  They refer to it as &quot;pornography&quot; despite very clearly talking about nudity.  Nudity is not, never has been, and never will be, pornography.  The view that nudity is disgusting, disturbing, or should be forbidden is itself an extremely radical and anti-human viewpoint.  It&#39;s one which is only very recently developed in society, and which has only spread since the 1990s.  Even the most radically puritanical societies of the past viewed nudity as harmless, and usually unavoidable in day to day life (depending on how far back you are going).  The attempt to redefine &#39;pornography&#39; as &#39;nudity&#39; and the attempt to redefine &#39;nudity&#39; as &#39;wearing revealing clothing like underwear or bathing suits&#39; is a novel attempt at social engineering.  While in the past you would need to make a reasoned argument to human beings to try to convince them to hide their filthy, immoral body parts, Facebook, Apple, Google, and the other various companies are using their control over the means of communication to technologically alter social norms and morality.  After all, if tomorrow everyone in the world woke up and said &#39;wait, 100% of human beings have bodies and it is childish and senseless to be concerned about seeing them&#39; - how would they talk about this revelation?  Any attempt they made to show people that they actually believed this would be instantly curtailed by the censorbots.  No one would know that the rest of the entire world agreed with them.<br><br>Even if you agree that human bodies are a disgusting, offensive burden that the human species has to bear in private, the willingness to use this power should be terrifying to everyone.  The American Heart Association believed that they saw in the medical research a correlation between saturated fats in a persons diet and heart disease.  Being in the position they were, they were able to circumvent needing to educate and appeal to the publics reason in order to attempt to change peoples diet.  They used government regulations and programs instead.  And they accomplished their goal of reducing the portion of Americans daily caloric intake coming from saturated fats by 15%.  The problem, however, is that when companies removed saturated fats from their food, they tasted like cardboard and no one wanted them.  So they added salt and sugar to restore flavor, which reignited public interest in the foods.  It ended up radically increasing the overall caloric intake of most of the public.  Which led to an obesity epidemic, a diabetes epidemic, and yes, a heart disease epidemic.  And then they found out that saturated fats were never really quite as dangerous as feared.  But by that point, their unintended consequences were already killing hundreds of thousands of people a year.  And while you can correct having told someone something wrong with some more education, changing large-scale social behavior back isn&#39;t something which can be done.  The negative consequences will continue to wreak suffering and death for a generation at least.  Are we so absolutely dead certain that the human body is something we evolved to have be a danger to ourselves that we&#39;re willing to accept all the unintended consequences of barring it completely from public discourse?  When most children already reach adulthood having never seen more than a handful of actual real normal human beings nude (pornography does not feature normal human beings, it features statistically abnormal examples of beauty) and they believe their own bodies to be abnormally ugly, are we going to be comfortable with the rise in suicides, body dysmorphic disorder, etc?  Something which could be cured by simply seeing a few normal people naked (especially in person as used to occur in school showers or gym or pool changing rooms but which is now avoided almost completely) can, and does, kill in addition to inflicting people with a profound lack of understanding and perspective on the human form.

Automation, which companies like facebook have control over, and education, which is what&#39; you&#39;re helping to contribute to.  <br><br><br>I also work in the realm of cybersecurity, and (very) often, our last line of defense, is the &#39;end user&#39;, the person ultimately being exposed to the potentially malicious content. As you keep saying, with counter, and counter-counter measures, the battle to automatically remove malicious content will never be over, but in the end, users are the ones being exposed to it.<br><br><br>In my company, we have mandatory Phishing\\Malicious content training, which seems to be (at least somewhat) effective.  But I fear mass-scale multi-billion person training would be infeasible if facebook\\twitter\\ect were to try to enforce similar training to users.  While your videos are hitting the nail on the head, it is only reaching a small subset of the users actually using these platforms. <br><br><br>Do you think these social media companies have an obligation train their users in a similar way? They&#39;d certainly have the capability to distribute such training, but as with all cybersecurity, Something is either convenient, secure, or somewhere in-between.  SM companies adopting a more secure position would mean a less convenient experience for everyone, and therefore less users, a pretty scary catch22. While SM companies are trying to maximize user engagement, and therefore profit, they are also pressured (correctly) to decrease malicious engagement, at the cost of legitimate engagement. <br><br><br>I guess my point in the end, is that SM companies that take social manipulation seriously, are essentially combating themselves, and it worries me to think that a company that decides not to take such issues seriously, will have a financial advantage over the ones who do. We see this somewhat already with Youtube censoring; The more Youtube tries to ensure its content is &#39;suitable&#39;, and the more legitimate accounts that get affected by takedowns or similar censoring, the more users are motivated to find another platform that isn&#39;t affected by the same issues.

I work on many of these problems, and I&#39;d actually argue I work on the root of this problem, which is digital identity (or Self Sovereign Identity as we call it). I have a handful of friends at Facebook and the other social media giants and I don&#39;t hold the failure to solve these problems against them, however, their companies can fundamentally NOT solve this problem (at least in a way that doesn&#39;t create equally bad or worse problems). This is because of the business model. It is one that attempts to monetize something that isn&#39;t theirs, identity and reputation. This isn&#39;t always clear at first when you look at the situation, but it is ultimately what it all resolves to. Advertising is based on impressions and implicit in that is that the impressions are on unique humans. Facebook cannot physically validate the personhood of every user so they do it programmatically, which they are struggling with. This leads to an inefficient arms race scenario. There then is a second, but related problem. Facebook does not have any user facing concept of reputation, and for good reason. Reputation systems are notoriously hard to get right and in most cases end up being incredibly oppressive (Facebook does have an internal concept of user reputation though, which has its own dangers). However, reputation is the key to scaling identity systems and interaction online in a way that is resilient against manipulation and dishonesty. IRL you cannot stand on a street corner and yell fake news into crowds of people WITHOUT incurring repuational cost. Reputation is the way we have always scaled scaled human interaction up until now and it has largely worked because everyone gets to run and update their own reputation algorithms on everyone else in a way that accounts for context. This is essentially what we are referring to when we tell someone to not be so judgemental. The difference in risk between a decentralized, open source, bottom up reputation system and a top down, opaque, and rigid one is incredibly critical, in fact it is the difference between the world we want and 1984. So , why doesn&#39;t facebook build that reputation system? Well, because to build an open source, decentralized reputation system Facebook would have to cede the control of users&#39; data back to them, if they don&#39;t, then it is centralized and if they do then it allows users to withhold their data/reputation from Facebook while still having the ability to interact with their peers directly and the result is the plummeting of Facebook&#39;s ad revenue. Facebook relies on being able to hyper target on the basis of having access to highly detailed data on billions of people. That would go away. There are many other concepts to explore here and I have oversimplified a number of things but suffice it to say that we have what is likely a binary choice in our future: one where Facebook or other centralized platforms accrue power and increase oppression in desperation to solve this problem OR one where Facebook, Google, and even governments lose control over their customer/user/constituent&#39;s identity and reputation leading to their demise.", "comment_date": "2019-04-25T00:23:20Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Butch Wilson", "comment_text": "Thanks for this, Sir.

If you look at the comments on my videos they appear to be bot generated but in actuality they are all left by fellow start-up channels. - just people who want to start up a channel themselves.  This is why the comments seem extra encouraging. I can see how it would be extremely difficult to distinguish bots from people who are leaving comments for support!<br><br>It seems like YouTube promotes new channels to other new channels, possibly to encourage interactions and engagement.  there&#39;s a lot of clicking the thumbs up button just for points going on.  heck sometimes it seems like people focus on getting more followers then producing the content!  I assume this is for financial gain.<br><br>I would say to the development teams of future applications - take a look at how video games (MMORPGS) are handled as social environments.  Below I will try my best to outline the pros and cons of the game method.<br><br># THE PAY WALL<br>\u2022 The pay wall: a new user is prohibited from progressing or engaging with other users unless they pay a fee.<br>     This can provide income for service fees, future projects and profit. It also acts as a verification method for age and<br>     location. Moreover it can act as an investment, for example , if someone spends $100.00 on an account over a\u00a0<br>     period of several years - they may not want to loose it if they break the rules.  <br>   <br>     it&#39;s not all-good though, asking users for a sign-up fee can encourage hacking of funds or accounts to acquire a  \u00a0<br>     &quot;free&quot; account for exploit or money to provide for the fee.  You may also see selling of accounts on the black market<br>      and account sharing to bypass this aspect.\u00a0<br><br># SOCIAL PEERS<br>\u2022  Social peers (A.K.A. Friends) are people inside the environment who know your individual personality and can vouch \u00a0<br>   for you.  This is an often overlooked spect but plays a role every-day.  Often the first notice of a hacked account is \u00a0<br>   made by a friend of the user who notices that the person isn&#39;t acting like they normally do.  If you&#39;ve ever encountered\u00a0<br>   a game with a justice system ( judge jury act)  having a friend to vouch for you can make all the difference in the\u00a0<br>   world when we are trying to figure out who is responsible or what happened.  Take a while and think of all the\u00a0<br>   different ways friends can help in this sort of situation.<br><br>   Again- we have downsides.  For instance, say all your friends are bad-apples and encourage you to do bad things ,\u00a0<br>   well that&#39;s kind of what this video is about - isn&#39;t it?  It&#39;s usually up to the user in games to acquire friends and\u00a0<br>   connections. But what Facebook and other platforms have done is automate the finding of fiends and directly\u00a0<br>   connects you to everything that shares a remote common theme.  You have little control over who your friends are.<br><br># CLEAR RULES <br>\u2022 Clear rules that are not only enforced but encouraged by the community.  Yes it&#39;s easier to bust people when the chess board can warp into anything ( I yelled &quot;WHAT NOW&quot; at my screen at <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FY_NtO7SIrY&amp;t=17m40s\">17:40</a>) but remember some of the playing pieces on the board are also good and decent who are going along for the ride.  Clear rules gives those people who want to live by the book a guideline to follow (e.g. do <i>this</i> and you will be [ok]) that&#39;s all they need.<br><br>Sometimes you run into people who don&#39;t understand why we don&#39;t have a big list of things you CAN do verses only having a vague list of things that are general rules of thumb and occasionally listing punishments for examples on things you CAN&#39;T do. I say this aspect was covered well in this video and (if I can remember) will send people here instead of attempting to explain the difference.    But we always will have misunderstandings. <br><br>I like to use &#39;is the sky is blue&#39; analogy here.. What if we have two people talking and you hear one of the people say &quot;is the sky is blue&quot; and the other one responds with &quot;well duh, its because of how the light....ect ect&quot; .. then the first person  replies &quot; it was a rhetorical question... &quot;     This is the kind of thing that is hard to distinguish even for humans. we can&#39;t write the solution because we don&#39;t know what it is!  Quick- tell me what it is so I can write it down!<br><br> # COMMON LANGUAGE<br>\u2022 this brings us to common language - with games,  everything has to be easy to interact with. everything from how you control your character to how you interact with other players.  With chat based games, language is an obvious issue. You can&#39;t have people talking in an alternate language that your moderators can&#39;t read.<br><br>Turns out this solution was implemented by mistake (I think) when regain optimization was more heavily used with online games to improve connection speed.  Because people who lived closer to each other most likely had a better connection and spoke the same langue this was a decent move!  (this comment is not sponsored  by VPN :p) <br><br>I have to say from experience of trying to deal with systems not written in English - it&#39;s a nightmare to even figure out what is going on in the code.  the solution to that was they hired a technician that knew the language and he would amend the source code from time to time. they would pass a big list of things that they wanted changed and he would go-ahead and update. \u00a0<br><br>I&#39;m telling you right now it would have been better to re-write the entire thing from scratch.

They&#39;d often have short blurbs pointing out a &quot;hypocrisy&quot; by listing &quot;facts&quot; or something.  But pretty much every one of them contained misinformation in them.  Often even outright lies.  Thing is they spread like a disease and because they mixed in humor with extremism people didn&#39;t see how they were swaying their opinions.   In the same way Fox News intentionally misrepresented the Green New Deal until their audience wholly believed it was about banning cows and air travel.. these memes do similar.
