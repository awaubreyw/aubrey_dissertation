I have a whole library on my SSD about it comprised of master theses from military academies, manuals, user guides, even video games like Dangerous Waters, Cold Waters, Command Modern Operations use this information....  They really don&#39;t have to pretend that this was top secret information that would lead to the Russians learning something new about the basics of passive sonars. \r<br>\r<br>If he can&#39;t even answer that simple question if <i>&#39;they use multiple frequencies&#39;</i> (whatever that means, a passive sonar only listens), then he does not seem to be the brightest bulb in the box, pretending he&#39;d reveal classified information about passive sonars answering that question. That is just ridiculous.  The answer is publicly available. No need to extra board a submarine to ask him of all people. Therefore, I had to turn off that kindergarten programme at this point, because with the &quot;help&quot; of these tight-assed guys I would certainly never become any smarter.

TV and FM transmissions suffer from it and good calbre receivers can be equipped with ways to measure it (so you can choose where to best direct your receiver&#39;s antenna) or handle it. It&#39;s difficult to handle since you don&#39;t already know what the transmission signal is (unlike active sonar) and usually the signal is probably more complicated than that of an active sonar (unless you&#39;re listening to a radio clock).<br>But getting back to FM reception (which is much closer to my heart) you can get devices to insert between the antenna line and your receiver (or even more amazingly, right after your receiver&#39;s output) that supposedly can deal with the multipath artefacts. Nowadays of course, with the cheap computing power at everyone&#39;s disposal, it&#39;s much more interesting to deal with this phenomenon using advanced DSP techniques.

Both tube and solid state systems. But I wanna know everything from how the microwaves are generated, to how the waveguide assemblies worked and what specific parts of them did. How it made sense of the data that came back. How it dealt with errors or determining what is or isn&#39;t an object of significance, etc. I certainly have the resources to learn about it. Like I said, there is a lot of information about old systems out there. It seems like almost a niche interest for some people.<br><br>But now that I&#39;ve seen this video, you&#39;ve got me wondering some, or more, of the same questions about sonar. Like what frequency or spectrum they use, and why. Or are they able to adjust the frequency and/or range depending on the situataion? Is the signal modulated? What kind of circuit does it use to generate the sound? How does a sonar speaker differ from a speaker for audible sound in air, if at all?<br><br>Just like with radar, I&#39;m sure if I did some digging I could find some declassified documents explaining how older sonar systems worked in such in depth detail.

Earthquake body waves (that travel inside the &quot;body&quot; of Earth) is similar to sonar waves (also travels inside the body of water) in that both have some zones that cannot be detected. <br>For example, a P wave can only be detected by the seismograph on the first circle, but the seismographs on the second circle can find waves like PP wave (a P wave that bends as it travels inside mantle until it reaches the surface, refracts into the mantle again, and gets bend until it reach the surface the second time). <br><br>I am typing as I watch this video, it&#39;s so cool that even shadow zone is also a term used in geophysics! Increasing temperature and pressure profile and the property of the outer core created the shadow zone for Earth&#39;s earthquakes.

I absolutely love your channel! Amazing work, you are the best! I have one question on this specific video. You mentioned that a sub may be able to hide in one specific &quot;blind&quot; spot, and other vessels would not be able to find it with active sonar. This is due to specific conditions affecting the reflection and propagation properties of the water that could create this specific patterns with blind spots. Is this not only true if the &quot;searcher&quot; remains at one location? If the &quot;searcher&quot; changes its location, surely the propagation and reflection patterns of the sonar waves would also change, and consequently the &quot;blind spot&quot; location? (Apologies if this was mentioned in earlier comments, I did not have time to go through 6908 comments!  ) By the way, I am sure the navy may have censored you on this, but it is basic physics to eliminate those blind spots \u2013 use a wide frequency spectrum. The sonar (sound) waves will bend at different angles for different frequencies, thus effectively eliminating blind spots. And with modern day fast processing equipment I am sure they are capable of using a very wide range of frequencies these days. And that is how they would also eliminate sea floor and ice reflections.

Even the density of the water can bend the sonar pulse. The sonar equipment is capable of ray-tracing the curved paths, bottom bounce and more. For example, the thermocline will both bend and deflect the sonar signal, depending on the specific angle of incidence, the severity of the thermocline, the salinity of the water and MUCH more. To say this is complicated would be like saying card counting is more advanced than teaching a child to count grapes. They both involve counting, but card counting is far more complicated and requires you to keep track of multiple variables in order to maintain accuracy.

He passed away several years ago, but this video has brought me closer to understanding what my grandpa worked on. So thank you for teaching me more about my family!<br><br>P.S.

This can be used to your benefit if you are a hiding or prowling submarine. This is called the shadow zone here, but is better termed the SOFAR Channel (Sound Fixing and Ranging).  Basically, it is located at the bottom of the thermocline where pressure dominates sound velocity increase instead of temperature.  It is easily calculated and measured routinely.  XBTs (expendable bathythermographs) are still used commercially, for research, and for military use but are limited to when you don&#39;t want to come all stop to take a sound velocity profile (SVP).  Otherwise we use SVPs which you can lower down through the thermocline and recover and use over and over.  This method is time-consuming when in very deep water, but common industry practice.  Taking regular SVPs is critical for accurately imaging the seabed, sea ice in this case, bearing and range to targets, etc. It is a standard practice in any hydrographic or geophysical survey as well as subsea tracking which requires a USBL tracking system.   <br>It should be noted that the SOFAR channel not only is used to hide by submarines but also to communicate very long distances over very low frequencies without being directly detected from the surface.", "comment_date": "2021-01-04T19:26:52Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Richard Allred", "comment_text": "Is the shadow zone reciprocal?

I think speech science can help give insight into your question at <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqqaYs7LjlM&amp;t=18m05s\">18:05</a> - at least part of it. Our speech sounds are formed by the manipulation of the sounds coming from our vocal folds. Back in undergrad (current grad to become an SLP), when I was studying formants in speech, I could guess fairly accurately which speech sounds were being made just by looking at a spectrogram. Certain speech sounds have unique ways in which they bend formants. Therefore, the placement of our articulators (tongue, lips) relative to place of articulation (teeth, roof of mouth) alters the raw sound produced by our vocal folds, making speech.<br><br>I&#39;m guessing that ice, sediment, rock, organic material - you know, stuff the earth had before submarines - alter the formants of the ping in an already-identified way. People onboard the ship can tell they are looking at something natural from the shape of the formants. Maybe even limestone, shale, sediment, sandstone, etc all can be identified in a flash. <br><br>Assuming I&#39;m right, then naturally, steel, aluminum, rubber, plastic - you know, boat stuff - would have their own signature. <br><br>*Therefore*, when a sound bounces back that resembles ice + hull of a boat + ice, then they can surmise that that sound hit the ice, then the object, then the ice, then the sub. But if the reflection back from their ping ONLY resembles the formant shifts typical of boat hulls, then you should head in the direction of that individual source of reflection to track the object.<br><br>Orrrr not just a guess.", "comment_date": "2021-01-04T10:57:03Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Gen0me Gen0me", "comment_text": "On spectrogram single object would reflect sound in its special characteristics so sounds coming back directly from it would characterize similarly. Well im not sure if human ear can hear a difference but you can check it by hearing to the echoes in the real world. Maybe a reasoneable comparison to start up would be comparing different mountains echoes to different ships echoes. If it is about the different returns coming from a single ping, I dont see this as real problem. In 3 dimensional space waves energy decreases ~r^2 to the source distance. So if the sound return is direct it most likely would be orders of magnitude stronger than indirect ones. Notice that figuring out which echo came first and from which object when you see object in a straight line is only hard on the small distances.", "comment_date": "2021-01-04T10:39:07Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Big Sasquatch", "comment_text": "This is the best series you\u2019ve ever made Destin, amazing work", "comment_date": "2021-01-04T09:56:34Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Big Sasquatch", "comment_text": "This is the best series you\u2019ve ever made Destin, amazing work", "comment_date": "2021-01-04T09:55:44Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Kali Elvis", "comment_text": "&quot;Measure the distance to the target.

My theory is that the sub knows it&#39;s depth from the pressure of the water column above it, and it knows how far it is from the bottom since I would imagine that most of the ocean floor&#39;s topology is well mapped, presumably with a resolution that&#39;s within the sub&#39;s &quot;navigational tolerances&quot; (if that&#39;s a thing... what I mean is that the difference between where the sub and the target thinks they are, and where they actually are, is good enough).

I&#39;m an electronics technician and operator working for a subsea robotics manufacturer, and I can honestly say that the level of depth (pun intended) that you went into was impressive.<br><br>Just a quick addendum regarding the characterization of the sound velocity profile: In commercial industry, when you&#39;re about to perform a sonar survey of an area, rather than using an expendable bathythermograph, you will conduct a &#39;CTD cast&#39; using a device commonly referred to as a CTD. They&#39;re generally not expendable, and will usually be lowered via a line over the side of the vessel to the bottom, or carried to the bottom by either an autonomous or remotely operated vehicle (AUV or ROV), either way they&#39;re typically recovered (so that the data can be collected) and reused.<br>The name is an initialism for Conductivity, Temperature, and Depth as these are the main characteristics the device measures (many have additional instruments, such as an SV probe, for directly measuring sound velocity). Conductivity tells you the salinity of the water which allows you to produce a curve characterizing the halocline, a higher salinity usually means a higher density and therefore higher sound speeds. Temperature is measured the same as the bathythermograph to characterize the thermocline, just as you explained in the video, and depth is measured via a pressure transducer allowing you to chart halocline and thermocline against the water column. With this information, along with the known depth of the operating sonar, you can compensate for the distortion that a variable speed of sound will have on your imagery.<br><br>Thanks again for another awesome video!", "comment_date": "2021-01-03T21:56:33Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Pontus", "comment_text": "Work a lot with radar in the navy.

But to future submarine designers I&#39;d like to say: take a look inside the cockpit of an EA-18G Growler and how radiofrequency emitters are represented on a screen, all automatically categorized and identified (if in an ELINT database).

How about giving that to a commander of a sub and give him a helmet mounted sight that projects all the data a fighter dispolays in the HUD?

This also shows the levels of security and classification.

Hopefully, your potential adversaries never understand just how good you are, so they don&#39;t start trying to get even better.  Getting them to underestimate you leads to maintaining the greatest advantage.<br><br>All these levels can intermix.  A lot of the difference can be whether you are discussing their particular applications and equipment, or are you taking a class on signal/waveform processing in the abstract at a university, or are you using similar phenomena in another setting.<br><br>For example, when I used to do sound setup/design, I could walk into a room, see where the speakers were positioned and pointing, look at the shape of the room and its various contents (including ceiling beams, etc) and tell you where the dead spots or hot spots were going to be for various pitch ranges.  I might then move or turn one set of speakers even a few inches and greatly clean up the acoustics for the whole audience, or find a best compromise around the space.  This is similar to what the sub does.<br><br>[At one church I was helping with their sound, I actually told some of the elderly members they needed to avoid sitting in a few certain seats, because their hearing range loss was making dead spots for them in a room, in parts of vocal ranges that were otherwise tuned fine for the general audience.  They had a personal &quot;shadow zone&quot; if they sat in those particular spots.  One little lady didn&#39;t believe me, so I actually had to lead her around to show her the differences while the pastor did some practice lines from the podium for us.]<br><br>So I could talk about the way a band will sound all day with no problem, but the minute I start describing it in terms of military equipment and situations, it can suddenly become a classification issue.  That&#39;s part of why there was some debate and negotiation between the officers about what made which parts of the conversation &quot;a no-go&quot; depending on their interpretation of those levels.<br><br>So many funny (or tragic) stories can come out of waveform interactions!

I&#39;ve played realistic sub sims before and passive sonar is an important part of it. Subs typically tow an extra sonar receiver well behind the ship giving them two places to receive sonar readings from. Because of their displacement, sonar contacts will have slightly different bearings from the front and towed hydrophones, which help you to pinpoint a range on a contact. Learning to identify other vessels from their sound, and doing TMA (target motion analysis) is the next step, to figure out where a target is, what it is, and where it&#39;s going and at what speed. With this information one can get a firing solution for a torpedo, all without using an active ping.<br><br>Even dealing with thermal layers was part of the simulation.

This is determined by the BT probe drop as you showed.   Thermocline is a steep temperature gradient in a body of water, IE: drastic drop in temperature.   Below this depth a submarine can hide and not be heard nor pinged on, as sound waves bounce off of the thermocline layer.  In order for a submarine to hear above that depth, they must rise above the thermocline  This is when they can hear and can be detected.  They do this briefly so as not to be discovered.  If they were to ping above that line, ships would know their location, so they dont generally actively ping except to get a bearing/distance location of their target to make a precise aiming solution for their torpedo.  As a surface ship, if you hear a submarine ping, they have acquired you as their target and will be firing on you.

Even though the purpose of the antenna dish was to tightly focus the radar waves into a &quot;pencil&quot; beam, so much radio energy leaked off the edges of the dish that radar waves traveling straight down bounced off the ground and returned to the receiver by the same path.

Very slow paced game with sudden bursts of action tho, which isn&#39;t really to some people&#39;s taste in gameplay.<br>WW2 sub sims are also fun, but THAT sonar is extremely primitive compared to today. It&#39;s entirely up to the sonar operator to classify contacts and determine what direction they are and estimate distance. Then in the con room other people will use Target Motion Analysis (TMA) to try to pinpoint where the target is, how far away, and how fast it&#39;s moving. ... TMA is still done on modern ships, but is done with computers rather than by hand on navigation maps. (Tho it&#39;s my understanding that crew on modern subs are still required to learn the by-hand method)<br>I haven&#39;t finished watching yet, but they could at least talk about the differences between bow sonar (the spherical array) which hears mid to high frequencies, the towed arrays which hear lower frequencies, and the side sonar which hears kinda between them.<br>I&#39;ve long wondered how directional the spherical array is, cuz the games don&#39;t really model that. I&#39;d THINK that it could tell if something was above or below the sub&#39;s depth, but not sure.", "comment_date": "2020-12-28T17:41:03Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Simantak Dabhade", "comment_text": "This sonar stuff is so much more complex than I previously thought mate, thanks!", "comment_date": "2020-12-28T17:40:16Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Lil Mikey1", "comment_text": "CLEVELAND OHIO FIRE SONGS ON MY PAGE \ud83d\udd25\ud83d\udcaf\ud83d\udcaf\ud83d\udcaf\ud83d\udcaf\ud83d\udd25", "comment_date": "2020-12-28T17:37:41Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Carlos Velez", "comment_text": "I was a sonarman on the USS Alaska for four years.

In its most simple form you can imagine having two microphones at the front of a sub, one on the left and one on the right. <br><br>If a ship you are detecting is somewhere off to the front right, the sound will return to the right side mic first before the left mic. The phase delay from left to right can be used to calculate at what angle the sound is coming from (direction to get to the ship). The distance on the other hand would be calculated from the total delay from initially releasing the ping to receiving the ping back. The acoustic signature details can be used to predict which ship it is, potentially not just the model but possibly the exact specific ship (eg one ship might have slightly lower compression in one cylinder compared to another ship of the same model or perhaps there is a bit of bearing noise in a prop shaft, etc).<br><br>One way to calculate how fast an object is moving is to ping it twice and use the two distances to calculate its speed and direction. Another option is to use the doppler effect by releasing a specific frequency and looking at how much it changes. This change in frequency tells you how quickly the ship is moving towards or away from you. By comparing the doppler shift between two or more separated microphones, the direction of travel can be calculated.", "comment_date": "2020-12-28T01:06:29Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Straw Man Gaming", "comment_text": "Destin is almost painfully wholesome.

If you are on the lookout and spot an object and you are not certain if you are on a collision course with it, you can take the bearing and see if it changes. While the technology on the sub is of course many times more sophisticated, I have been on a vessel where you could literally pop a metal device on your compass, look through it and adjust it until you see your object and then read the bearing from the compass. Then watch how the bearing changes over time and you know where it will pass you and how you could steer to increase the distance between your ship and the other one.<br>Thanks a lot for this super interesting series!", "comment_date": "2020-12-27T15:44:22Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Deja Vu Sailing", "comment_text": "Their like Marvel actors at a press junket! xD", "comment_date": "2020-12-27T15:43:33Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Cl Arice Tayag", "comment_text": "The superb spring neurophysiologically matter because pancreas proportionally influence without a wet pilot. acidic, married grease", "comment_date": "2020-12-27T15:42:19Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "elub", "comment_text": "Thank you for the great work!", "comment_date": "2020-12-27T15:41:43Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "James Bruzgis", "comment_text": "Love it!

Anything making noise has a loudness inversely proportional to the square of the distance of the observer from it. This means that if you halve the distance, something is 4x louder. Active sonar hits this law twice: The submarine makes a &quot;ping&quot; and the loudness at the target is inversely proportional to the square of the distance from the target. Some of that noise gets reflected back, and it too is subject to the inverse square law, the overall effect being that doubling the distance makes active sonar pings 1/16 as loud.<br><br>Active sonar is very loud and can be heard a huge distance away, probably thousands of miles, whereas quiet submarines are very hard to hear even when relatively close. So, to avoid detection, submarines use passive sonar as much as possible.<br><br>In WWII, Sonar used single-frequency &quot;ping&quot; noises. I suspect that modern active sonar gear uses spread-spectrum, with short pulse lengths, so as to be much less noticeable to anyone using passive sonar, though the ability to do old-style &quot;Ping&quot; noises is probably retained for entertaining journalists!<br><br>Anyone wanting to know more than this needs to look at better sources.", "comment_date": "2020-12-27T15:22:52Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "IsabellaGraceS", "comment_text": "Ayyyy my brother is in the Navy and does this!!", "comment_date": "2020-12-27T15:20:27Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "The Dorito", "comment_text": "I bet there&#39;s some undercover military people watching this series to try to get smarter \ud83d\ude02", "comment_date": "2020-12-27T15:20:19Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Matrick13", "comment_text": "<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqqaYs7LjlM&amp;t=18m33s\">18:33</a> watch as destin get <b>very</b> excited", "comment_date": "2020-12-27T15:18:19Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "nivrin13", "comment_text": "Cool I can now find subs.

Destin, Id love to hear your take on what you think submarines smell like.  <br><br>Theres a lot of fun smells on subs. Burgers hitting the grill on a Friday, Pizza night, fresh bread on the midwatch. But there&#39;s also 132 manly men (and occasionally a few badass women) all living in close quarters. There&#39;s  sanitary tanks venting, trash room in the scullery, partially thawed and very slowly rotting meat in the semi broke-down freezer midway through your deployment (maybe that was just my boat lol).  But really the defining smell, the SUBMARINE smell is that stank that permeates everything you brought onboard with you, and even follows you home after going ashore. <br><br>Personally Id say subs smell sorta like a dirty 1995 McDonalds that serves a lot of Fillet-O-Fish and who&#39;s fryer is full of high-mileage 90wt about 18 months past due for a change.  The primary sub smell comes from monoethanolamine, know as amine on subs and as MEA in the chemistry world.  Amine is used in the air purifying equipment onboard as a means of scrubbing C02 from the air.  A lot of people say subs smells oily, like machinery or engine oil, and they kinda do but to me the boat smell is a lot more like well used fryer oil.  And a lot of other people say the &quot;sub smell&quot; is like cat pee.  The cat pee thing sorta jives since MEA gets produced using ammonia, and there are other chemicals used onboard that also have the distinct cat pee smell and could potentially get into the air.  <br><br>Anyways if you actually read all this Destin, thanks.  its a shame that what happens aft of the RC shield was off limits for you and this project and probably will be forever.

Sometimes you may feel as if you are in free fall when people or things you had counted on let you down.         <br><br>Yet as soon as you remember that JESUS IS WITH YOU, your perspective changes radically. You can look to Jesus for hope and help. Dear ones, not only is Yeshua (Jesus) with you but He will hold you by your right hand, guide you, counsel you, and take you into His Glory. All you have to do is say YES to Him this very moment and receive the promises of his unfathomable love.             <br><br>I welcome you to receive our Creator THIS VERY MOMENT by first acknowledging that you are a sinner in need of our Savior.

The received signal is also chopped up into chips, and a decoder uses the same pattern at some small delay to flip the amplitude of, again, half of the chips. <br><br>The delay is to make up for the signal&#39;s time-in-flight. The first half of the trick is that every path has a different length, and therefore a different time-in-flight. When you select a certain delay, you&#39;re really selecting a certain path length to listen to. The decoder hunts for the strongest signal path by trying out different delays. <br><br>In a perfect radio environment -- one cell tower, one phone, one path, zero noise -- finding the right delay and flipping the chips back would perfectly re-create the original bits: 128 chips in a row that are all ones or all zeroes. In the real world, it creates a statistically recognizable approximation of that: blocks of 128 chips that are skewed toward a higher or lower amplitude than the average. <br><br>And there&#39;s the second half of the trick. This statistical reconstruction <b>only works</b> for one chip pattern and one path length. That&#39;s the only way flipping half the chips is going to drive a large block of them <b>away</b> from the average signal. For everything else -- whether it&#39;s a noise burst, another return of your signal along a different path, or even another phone on the exact same frequency but using a different chip pattern -- it drives it <b>towards</b> the average.<br><br>That&#39;s how the decoder chooses between one delay and another. When the delay matches the time-in-flight of the strongest signal path is when the decoder output looks the most like the original solid blocks of chips.<br><br>Even in the 1990s, the integrated circuits in your phone would have three decoders on the same piece of silicon. Two of them could find the strongest signal paths from two different cell towers, and the third would find the second-strongest path from one of them. It gave you  soft handoffs from cell to cell and didn&#39;t allow a passing bus to block your whole call.<br><br>A 1976 Soviet over-the-horizon radar system used a very similar technique of modulated pulses, plus massive antenna arrays that could detect the bearing of each return. They called it Duga, NATO called it Steel Yard, and radio amateurs that it blasted off the air called it the Russian Woodpecker.

First return is important, due to shortest distance. Direction bearing is different for multipath and changes bearing.

Combined with a few good DSP (digital signal processors) and the known noise can be attenuated, such as in your birds and crickets example. With delay in a DSP a repetitive signal can be actively recognized and masked so the loud bird calls can almost vanish with the crickets and the background train would stand out as a new energy source. A sudden change in the bird call would be flagged as a change. Crickets suddenly going silent would be a marker.<br><br>It is awesome you got the interview. I was in the USN, but not in radar.

I bet analysis of acoustic returns can tell the difference of the acoustic signatures bouncing off different materials such as ice, wood, the ocean floor, or the steel hull of a ship.

As the waves bounce off a rock it sends back a &quot;ping&quot; of sorts that can be read by the submarine, just using the natural motion in the ocean.

Just like our stereoscopic eyes can gauge the 3D shapes due to the offset of our eyes, with two passive sonars someone could calculate the location of an object by factoring in the phase shift of the same signals between the two sensors. Of course echoes and &quot;optical&quot; bending (all of this density stuff is basically like optics in my mind, just different wave length) makes things a little more complicated than just simple trigonometry, but it&#39;s doable. Echoes I think are also not too hard to rule out: the signal will loose fair amount of strength (amplitude) when it bounces off a surface and also have to travel longer so the attenuation will be larger as well. So you&#39;ll want to keep the strongest echo back and throw away the weaker ones.

Now bring us to today, and science is largely shared once it&#39;s known... except when that science is how to stay stealthy, or listen for things, or kill people,  and once again we have to &quot;reinvent the wheel&quot; and all of that is time and resources that if spent in other avenues could advance us as a species just a little bit more.<br><br><br>Ok soapbox off.", "comment_date": "2020-12-26T19:19:02Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Natester", "comment_text": "Great video, very informative.", "comment_date": "2020-12-26T19:18:23Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Benjamin Estell", "comment_text": "Great series of deep, technical videos!

(Full disclosure, I was a radar technician in the Navy).<br><br>The delineation between regular and SAP radar systems is that SAP takes into account all relative motion - that of the signal source as well as that of targets. That relative motion is then plotted as apparent motion relative to the signal source. The &quot;waterfall charts&quot; you referred to are also known as histograms.<br><br>Transceivers (or transducers as they are called in sonar) are both used to generate the pulses AND listen for the return echos. To do this high speed switching between transmitting pulses and listening for the return echo must be used. Therefore timing of digital signal processing is critical. The receiver circuitry is electrically isolated from the transmitted signal by gating the receiver with a blanking signal which is generated in tandem with output pulses.<br><br>We humans also generate blanking signals in our visual cortex. They happen during rapid eye movements called secades. During the time our eyes are moving through a secade, our eyes are switched completely off and when the secade ends they are turned back on again. Because of the persistence of our vision we are unaware that our eyes were ever turned off for a brief period of time. Bats also utilize (high frequency) ultrasonic sonar and they too have a blanking circuit for their ears. They switch their ears completely off hundreds of thousands of times per second during each emmited pulse of sound. Fun fact - bats are some of the loudest creatures on earth emitting ultrasound at an astounding  120dbm! They need those high speed perfectly synchronized blanking circuits or they would deafen (and thus blind) themselves!<br><br>Interestingly, one of the quirks of radar is minimum range detection. During foggy conditions radar is useless under a minimum distance due to the blanking circuitry which would still have the receiver circuitry electrically isolated from the antenna when the pulse echo returns. As an example, a radar mile - which is the time it takes a ping to be emitted and return from a target that is one mile away (about 12.4 microseconds for a nautical mile and 10.75 microseconds for a statute mile). <br><br>Keep up the great videos Destin!

Add in the different densities of water, temperature of water and salinity levels. All of that changes how sound transmits under water. Then there are thermoclines.

Submarines and ships have towed sonar arrays that can be &#39;flown&#39; up or down, even left or right (port or starboard). Oh, and anechoic tiles on submarines are like stealth plane design.

Going into depth, aka classified, was really not needed in this video.<br>The one thing you touched, and may have been deleted that would have been of interest is the frequency waterfall.  You showed the birds, crickets, and trains, but you did not touch upon distance.  Sounds tend to get absorbed differently.  This can be shown in a house.  High-frequency sounds tend not to bounce off of walls where low frequencies do.  You can show this by playing music in one room and then going to other rooms in the house and notice how the sound gets base-iey.  Another is looking at distant objects around your house.  On a clear day, they can be seen well. On a humid day, objects will tend to be bluer the further away, i.e., the red light gets absorbed.<br>Multipath is something that is well known.

(Not to brag, but I called it before I you said train!!!)  This is really cool, since I&#39;ve never seen how a train shows up on a spectrograph like this.  So the question for you is, do you know why the train noise started suddenly instead of a gradual increase as the train moved by?  I&#39;m sure the train didn&#39;t just start up to full speed all of a sudden.  I&#39;m guessing you are a mile or two away from this train moving perpendicular to you???<br><br>Turns out trains do not emit these frequencies in all directions equally within a certain range of distance.  They are much stronger to the left and right of the train, than front and back.  A train is a form of a &quot;line array&quot;.  It was really cool to see this your spectrograph.
