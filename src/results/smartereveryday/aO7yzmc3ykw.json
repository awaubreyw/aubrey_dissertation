So this is my hypothesis on why slow motion cameras don&#39;t record sound. When something is recorded at 1/1000 real time and there&#39;s a sound that gets slowed down to that extent, that sound is also reduced in frequency by that factor. So a sound recorded at 20 kHz played back at 1/1000 real time (meaning the camera recorded at 30,000 frames per second and played back at 30 FPS), that frequency has to go down to 20 Hz. It goes from one extreme end of the range of human hearing to the other. So a sound wave coming into the microphone at 1 kHz would be replayed at 1 Hz and would be imperceptible to the human ear if it were recorded. <br>A microphone would ONLY work if the slow motion isn&#39;t done to a high degree. Even a factor of 2 makes a huge difference in pitch. It&#39;s how the Slow Mo Guys got the background music for all their old videos. It&#39;s Synthetic Design 02 from iMovie played back at half speed.<br>The best way to think about it is to imagine it like a record player. It works by the needle being vibrated by variations in the grooves. If you play a 45 RPM record back at 33 RPM, those variations are hitting the needle at a slower rate and not only will the music slow down, the pitch will drop as well. It does exactly the reverse if you speed a 33 up to 45 RPM. You can actually do this with Audacity and a song or other sound file you have stored on your computer to achieve the same effect.<br>In summary, a microphone on a slow motion camera is useless because almost any sound it records would have to be pitched so low as to be beyond the bounds of human hearing.", "comment_date": "2020-06-30T19:49:01Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Ben", "comment_text": "This ruined any slo-mo video with sounds effects.

Perhaps it would be more accurate to record the sound using a purely analog medium like a Vinyl disc or magnetic tape without converting the sound signal to a digital signal at all. This will preserve the &quot;infinite resolution&quot; (more or less infinite sample rate and bit-depth other than thermal noise n stuff) of the analog audio signal. Then you can slow the playback down on a phonograph  proportionally to Youtube&#39;s frame-rate compared to the recording camera&#39;s frame-rate. This will give you an idea of what it actually sounds like in slow-mo without the heavy frame-draggy / Aliasing-like sounding distortion that comes with slowing down and interpolating the quantized &quot;digital&quot; signal&#39;s finite sample rate. You can also manually sync the audio and video with a recording of your hand clapping or something.

Sound files are already captured at really high sample rates (48,000 samples per second). Primarily though, the main problem is straight up that sound takes too long to physically happen (well... and playing back a sound slowly is still producing a physical phenomenon that never existed... if an explosion was slower, it would have entirely different acoustic properties, not just the same...over a longer period of time).<br><br>Even a sound as sudden and impulsive as a firecracker will still be reverberating and travelling through the air to the microphone by the time the tomato has exploded. Any sound of the squishing fruit would be completely obscured.", "comment_date": "2017-12-27T20:02:30Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Nathan Dobbin", "comment_text": "Gordon is a slow motion foley artist...

Sure an orange being squished may sound like a tomato being shot, but do we know that&#39;s truly what it sounds like in slow motion, is it just a trick to add depth to the video? I especially hated the &#39;whoosh&#39; the candle flame made as it swayed, almost louder than the bullet passing the candle itself.
