It is not possible (illegal even, in the EU) to report or even suggest obvious copyright infringement unless you yourself own the copyright. So you have to contact the copyright owner. Many of the freeboots (is that the first usage of the plural, btw?) I&#39;ve seen are of pretty famous people. People who more often than not make it pretty hard work to contact them directly. And will most likely ignore you anyway. Do I want to sign up to &quot;social&quot; media sites just to stand a small chance of being seen by these people? Um; I&#39;d rather not.

I don&#39;t think this kind of judgement can be automated. Even if it could be, it would then be open to abuse of the system. No; it (currently) needs humans to investigate and correlate and make decisions. And many, many humans to collect the evidence.

NONE of them credited me OR asked permission. ALL of them cut out my intro&#39;s and pan cropped the footage to remove my watermarks and branding. And most deleted or removed my comments protesting and also removed comments from my regular viewers who also highlighted the issue. One page even uploaded the same video AGAIN after I had gone through Facebook&#39;s lengthy system and had it removed. They know what they are doing, Facebook knows what they are doing, but they are making money so my sheep isn&#39;t important.

And a class action suit is something they (and their all-powerful shareholders) will hear mighty loud and mighty clear.  You and other injured parties have pretty good evidence to back up such a suit, and verifiable monetary damages.

I spend thousands of my own money, drive tens of thousands of miles, days at a time out in brutal weather, and dozens of unpaid days off of work each year to capture my videos.  I have no sponsors, my video effort is self-funded (mostly by the video revenue).  Youtube is an equally guilty party in this saga - I have 700 DMCA takedowns filed already just for Youtube re-uploads of my videos by pirates, many with monetized channels.   Youtube has refused to grant me Content ID, meaning I have to manually search for and issue takedowns one-by-one.   To add insult to injury, their DMCA form has a 10-submission limit, which I often hit and have to wait to keep sending additional forms.   Google is now inserting captcha into every 4 or 5 keyword searches when I try to find infringing videos.  The thieves have a streamlined process to upload thousands of videos a day to immediately-monetized channels with no background checks or vetting, while obstacles are continually placed in my way to deal with the problem.   I have now spent more time dealing with infringement that I have <b>shooting the original videos</b> on my channel.  As a small-time creator, I&#39;m nothing in this fight, and Youtube/Facebook knows it.  Like Youtube, Facebook is not likely to grant any content ID system to the little guys, so I expect that without legislation,  the small-time creators will continue to get ripped off constantly.<br><br>It&#39;s getting to the point that the problem is beginning to affect my motivation and drive to create new content.

He cuddled it in his arms like a baby daughter. 4 One day a guest arrived at the home of the rich man.

The Lord, the God of Israel, says: I anointed you king of Israel and saved you from the power of Saul. 8 I gave you your master\u2019s house and his wives and the kingdoms of Israel and Judah.

AMAZING! To comment on your remark about court systems being able to see the logical evidence and how obvious it is that this is theft does not mean in any way, shape, or form that they are going to make logical decisions. It&#39;s nice to hope for and it makes sense to intelligent people, but in case you have not noticed there isn&#39;t a lot of truthful, intelligent, and powerful men in America now a days. you can be the first two, but then it is very unlikely you will become powerful. In fact i have listened to several powerful men talk on different occasions and most of them sound extremely tricky and more importantly uneducated. Funny as it is and as much as i doubted him at first Obama seems to be the closest person I have heard who may just fall into all three categories. With all of that said it seems that there is somewhat of a new trend happening lately and your videos are a strong lead toward health and intelligence. I am personally working as hard as i can, without making people to aggravated, to convince my friends, family, and acquaintances to learn more and more everyday. This is because i have come to the painful conclusion that it&#39;s not so much that people don&#39;t want to make intelligent decisions it&#39;s that they can&#39;t because the are not educated and it is &quot;too hard&quot; to retain the info from school and sites like yours because they are so unhealthy their brains cannot even begin to compile information without causing a headache.

We need a system that has a clean cut and very simple messaging system where you can add friends, and send them messages, links, and such, without peer pressure about your opinions to the public, and doesn&#39;t allow people to steal others content....wait, That&#39;s skype.

To keep in contact with friends and family more easily. Members of my own family do it.

Label your videos with a copyright and link back to your channel at the bottom of the video. That way it can lead back to you in the end even if others copy it.<br><br>2. What is the goal of your channel? Is it to make money or supply intelligent content and which one is more important to you? I am with you on the theft being 100% wrong and it should still be considered theft under the copyright and intellectual property laws. My point is, do you want to turn your youtube channel into a career or do it because you see value in the videos getting to people.\u00a0<br><br>3. Videos take almost no money to make. Items required to make the video take money. You spend no money on the hosting, the technology to allow this to be here or the advertising to get people to view the content. You get rewards with little to no risk. I would like to have some &quot;youtubers&quot; post their cost if they feel like they cost a lot.\u00a0<br>Now the honest aspect of this is people are stealing the work and making money off of it. This feels very wrong and is very wrong. I have had it happen to me with everything from code to youtube videos to blog posts as well and it sucks. I would like to see the focus be more on their theft and less on your monetary loss.\u00a0<br><br>4. This is a fight you will not win in the end because it is the internet. It is a place where information is freely communicated and spread with little laws and almost no repercussions. This means you can&#39;t silence people speaking up against injustice but it is almost impossible to prevent theft, cons, and other things of this sort. Try to make it where the focus is on what matters and make it difficult for people to benefit monetarily from your work.\u00a0", "comment_date": "2015-01-23T01:27:16Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Trippy", "comment_text": "Illuminati!<br>", "comment_date": "2015-01-23T01:21:27Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "rawb", "comment_text": "This is a massive problem that faces small time creators on the web.

It is actually quite difficult to formulate an analogy that mirrors every single aspect whilst trying to simplify the matter at the same time. You&#39;ll often just end up with a mirrored concept that is unlikely to serve a purpose that demonstrating the original concept might as well have achieved. The only purpose that a mirroring analogy could ever really serve is to make an alien concept familiar and that is obviously not the purpose needing or intending to be served here.<br>The purpose of the analogy in this case was merely to point out the social injustice and the fact that it is unfair to the creator. To that end, this analogy serves its purpose adequately. The children understood who was the victim, who was the perpetrator and why. It would be gratuitous if one were to try to utilize the analogy into aspects that it wasn&#39;t designed for and then criticize when it doesn&#39;t work as if it should have.

But I do study law and work in an environment that deals - almost on a daily basis - with IP rights. Funnily enough I was to explaining the concept of IP rights v. IP license to a colleague today. IP rights lie with the creator. An IP license allows someone else to use your IP for a fee (or not in the case of FB as you grant it upon accepting the terms) but they don&#39;t own your IP. They cannot do what they wish with it. Imagine FB granted a person the license to use their algorithms and that person had someone else copy it and make money off the advertising?! BUT - Here&#39;s the issue as I see it: An IP license only applies internationally if the country in which it is used has adequate IP protections. If it doesn&#39;t, then you have no ability to license but also no ability to have a legal say in what is done with that IP. So.. the question would be in which countries are these videos being uploaded after being copied from yours (or anyone else&#39;s) site? And do those countries have adequate IP protections? Also, Is this a breach of privacy laws for FB to find this out. You also have granted FB a license to use the IP you have provided. So, another question would be what does the term &quot;use&quot; in this context mean? &quot;Use&quot; can mean a wide variety of things: could they modify it, could they duplicate it, could they dispose of it, does it mean they (FB) have to maintain it? If it means they have to maintain it, then should there be a duty of care? By you uploading this IP content onto the FB page and granting them a license to &quot;use&quot;, does that mean that if anyone else duplicates this or copies this from the FB website, then they have effectively breached their license? There are holes in this argument I am aware (everything is debatable in court). But I thought I might as well throw my 2 cents worth in seeing as this is an issue I am close to. I am a subscriber to here and on FB.

For example I heard the end of a song by Kat Edmonson as I was\u00a0 turning on the radio, and wanted to hear the whole thing. I went to youtube and the only link that I could find that I could tell wasn&#39;t freebooted was to the &quot;Austin City Limits&quot; channel. I can&#39;t afford to buy all CD&#39;s from all the groups I like and I won&#39;t download pirate copies.

I&#39;ll begin with an analogy. I think Freebooting is a lot like Movie Piracy. The reason torrents, and pirated movies are so popular among consumers is because it solves an &quot;Availability Problem&quot;. I live outside the US and it takes ages for new TV shows to come here on DVD. But since the Internet is a thing and I know about &quot;Game of Thrones&quot; I solve the availability problem by downloading it off a torrent. But if I could pay for watching the same TV show live on the same day, there would be less incentive for me to download it off a torrent or visit a pirated movie store. Freebooters are the equivalent of a Pirated Movie Store for online content. They have access to a much larger consumer base than the original content producer. As a result, they are able to make profits by simply delivering freebooted content outside the producer&#39;s circle of influence. Trying to combat this situation through legal means is as hopeless as trying to stop movie piracy all around the world. So what should Destin do? Ensure his content is delivered to more people. If that involves hiring a digital marketing agency to promote his videos in previously untapped markets, then so be it. Considering the staggering number of views involved, it would be a worthwhile investment anyways. If you would like to depend on making videos for a living, you should strive to be more than just a &quot;content producer&quot;.
