I love unraid. I use something like it for my personal computer, but its made out of sources. Gentoo. <br><br>Anyway... that huge machine... sucks a lot of electricity. My guess is over 100W per hour. Me personally, I wanted something that used less. So I&#39;m using raspberry pi&#39;s, with 2 drivers in a raid 1 arrangement. each pi is a perfect raid1. I have a pair of 4 tb drives, 10 tb drives and 18  tb drives. personally i like the 4 tb most. if one crashes and you need to do a migration of all data on a new drive, it finishes first. Never had a drive actually crash, but its good to be prepared. <br><br>2 things.<br><br>1. electricity consumption. the cool thing about offline harddrives is that they dont use electricity. and also extend lives of harddrives. it seems like a weird idea, but the harddrives in boxes wasn&#39;t exactly un-optimized. Destin had lists and stuff, knew everything that was on those drives. Could help to have duplicates. <br><br>2. data safety. no backup method is 100% reliable. or hack proof. but most things should have at least one of each. a local backup, and a backup offsite. <br><br>if you combine the 2 together, you can make a mini farm of pi&#39;s. each with 2 drives, in raid 1. i have 6 pis with 6 drives, and they only use (with networking equipment together) 45W. my computer easily goes over 100W. So i could have another another backup, offsite. Me personally I had a nice uncle which is hosting my drives in his servers. And pays for that electricity for those drives. <br><br>But what matter most to me, I get a device that can saturate the network bandwidth and its using 3 W of power to operate. <br><br>I wont bother you with indexing, and making the whole thing faster, but there are tools. each with pro&#39;s and con&#39;s. but unless you use the same machine to operate data, and process data, u gonna run into network bottlenecks. those have solutions as well, but what I care most is mother earth. and when you scale things up, cost can really be a factor. <br><br>I find it interesting that harddrives won the storage wars. Even consoles nowadays come in &quot;digital&quot; form without a disc. And we have online storage, that is becoming cheap enough to consider. And I&#39;m guessing it&#39;s done with arm, not intel. <br><br>In the meantime, the pi is perfectly capable to sleep. like be in a state that is not shut down. and get a packet on network and wake up fast, spin up disks and be ready to serve data. with good hardware, and software, you can have all your data online with virtually 0 costs. or just the cost of pay per use. u can even count the electricity that was  needed to complete an operation. <br><br>Anyway, thanks for you videos &lt;3", "comment_date": "2021-08-03T22:57:54Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Christopher Anderson", "comment_text": "I need something like this for home but I\u2019m too poor", "comment_date": "2021-08-02T00:26:22Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Ozz Leoni", "comment_text": "Linus probably knows who shot JFK. <br>Destin has the high-speed footage..somewhere in one of the drives.", "comment_date": "2021-08-01T17:27:36Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "ARRYTHEBEAST", "comment_text": "linus is the technician of youtube ;)", "comment_date": "2021-08-01T03:44:20Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Logan Narmore", "comment_text": "linus came to bama wow. would have never thought of it.", "comment_date": "2021-07-28T23:55:27Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Portela Ricardo, da Silva", "comment_text": "I want to watch next video, YouTube notify me.", "comment_date": "2021-07-28T23:48:28Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Richard Amiss", "comment_text": "&quot;He (Linus Sebastian) does this thing where he puts.. servers in people&#39;s houses&quot; \r<br>... is the understatement of the internet!", "comment_date": "2021-07-27T14:54:32Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Jason", "comment_text": "A year later, how&#39;s it been going?

So the first year we had about 120 CDs for 1998, 170ish for 1999, etc. I had to keep track of what images where on which disc on a spreadsheet. Sometimes our data would just sit on a hard drive because no one had time to back the info up before going home and I&#39;d wake up in cold sweats afraid a hard drive would fail and we&#39;d lose data.", "comment_date": "2019-10-01T03:59:32Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Masoud", "comment_text": "I&#39;ve read somewhere that if the drives are identical and from the same batch, it increases the probability of them failing at the same time.

The RAID calculation is essentially a checksum - if the checksum fails, the data (somewhere) is bad.  The RAID controller will only &quot;fix&quot; the errors by attempting to make the checksum match again.  This could in effect make good data get replaced with what makes the checksum correct (coin toss if it&#39;s good or bad data).<br><br>This is one of the problems that a file system-level data integrity function like what ZFS does, is for.  It does a hash at the file, folder, volume level - so it understands when a file is corrupted and can actually fix it.  But taking one of the ideas for RAID1 (mirroring), you can duplicate the file in another location (takes a lot of extra storage) - and if the file system sees that the other copy&#39;s hash is correct, it&#39;ll just replace the bad data in that file with known good data - and job done.  Again a hardware controller can&#39;t tell which of the two files is bad or good - it can just tell they don&#39;t mathematically match.  A file system that looks at more than just blocks and uses much more data to derive a hash, can make better choices about the data.<br><br>It&#39;s hard to get one computer to house all the data you want and tolerate faults well - so many are moving towards a hybrid of ZFS at the volume level, and doing machine-to-machine and volume-to-volume redundancy with GlusterFS (a network file share system essentially).  Nice thing about that is you can set up Gluster to mirror your ZFS volumes across sites (using a private VPN), so you can say, run a copy of your data-farm at an in-law&#39;s house (have them get business internet, or better yet move the other copy into a data-center collocation rack) in another part of the country to reduce your exposure to a regional disaster.<br><br>You&#39;d probably be interested in making a trip to the U.S. Library of Congress - to see how they (as professional archivists) are keeping the digital collection they care for &quot;bit-accurate&quot;.  It&#39;s a complete paradigm shift from what home users and even most business users do - and to be frank, if your data is really that important to you, it&#39;s totally worth it to mimic.

Don&#39;t laugh too hard at it. It is <b>exactly</b> the approach to use when online, spinning storage either cannot hold enough data or cannot do it affordably. Justin&#39;s shoebox method will scale as big as his shoebox warehouse. We used to cascade the data so that the original, uncut data was in racks / boxes / etc. and took huge amounts of room. It was too much to handle more than once or a few times per year. A transformed and filtered version would be kept on a smaller set of media which you could probably crank through once per month. A set of summary tapes was distilled from that and you could go through that at the day timescale.

We&#39;d have made duplicates of what was in the shoeboxes and kept them in a separate location, often stored at remote sites.

Just  a single example : if Destin&#39;s closet/room/home faces a hazard (flood, fire, electrical,earthquake, or Destin&#39;s foot ;-) ), none of this installation may protects this data. Furthermore, some accidentally deleted file, or modified file may require to restore a much older version than the current one.

But for running a business, having server-class hardware (ECC memory and enterprise-level HDDs), using matched HDDs, and using the hardware strictly as a dedicated NAS, I&#39;d go with FreeNAS to obtain the benefits of ZFS (real-time bitrot/corruption detection and correction, snapshots and easy replication for backup).<br>I use both UnRAID and FreeNAS as they both have their own strengths.

Just as a real life case - In 2014 I had a house fire, and I was required, and fully able to recover ALL of my data from my UnRaid by copying the data off of each separate drive using a windows machine while sitting in the hotel we lived in for a month after the fire while they found us other temporary housing.  You will NOT be disappointed with UnRaid, and I am amazed that we have finally found something that you&#39;re not an expert on!  :-)   It wasn&#39;t mentioned in the video, but another advantage of the UnRaid concept is that the drive capacities can be upgraded one at a time as technology improved.  I started mine many years ago with 5 or 6 500gb drives, and now have six 8tb drives, with two of them being parity.   If you do any more videos with Linus,  I&#39;d LOVE to hear his suggestions on SUPER CHEAP ways to back up UnRaid systems to cloud storage because after having a house fire, I can assure you that RAID is NOT a substitute for offsite backups!!!", "comment_date": "2019-07-30T20:43:35Z", "likes_count": 5}, {"comment_by": "masterxm1972", "comment_text": "Hey Destin check out his SSD server content as an editing server idea and he also visited General Fusion which i think you might be interested in.", "comment_date": "2019-07-30T20:43:20Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "CptVolkow", "comment_text": "Cool to see cross play between two channels I independently subbed to.", "comment_date": "2019-07-30T20:43:15Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "TheKajunkat", "comment_text": "Whenever I see a video like this it always reminds me of an old article I read.
