And if you do it soft and fast enough people hear it as a B sound instead of a D sound. So the same thing a little harder and they hear a D sound instead of the slightly softer B sound. <br>Also those are good looking healthy animals.

I have long been fascinated by the plasticity of the brain, especially with kids.  Years ago I had a kid in my Sunday School class who, at 5 years old, was drawing pictures of people that were better than most of the best high school art students could draw.  This kid quit drawing stick figures by the time he was 2 or 3.  Muscle structure, shading and everything else was in his pictures.  The way he drew was even more fascinating.  He continually rotated the page as he drew!  Basically he was rotating an image in his head in 3 dimensions like a CAD machine.  Very few adults can mentally rotate images to this level much less draw this way.  A few years ago I began wondering if you could teach a child some level of mental image rotation if you started early enough.  Every month we had memory verses for our 1st through 5th grade Sunday School kids to memorize.  At the end of every month the same 3 or 4 out of 20 kids would have the verse memorized.  As an experiment, I began turning the page upside down and had the kids read upside down.  For several of the kids that soon got too easy so I had them hold it up to the light and read it through the back side of the page.  It didn&#39;t take too long before even that got too easy for a few so for them it&#39;s, turn the page upside down and read it through the back side of the page.  An interesting thing happened.  At the end of the month, every one of the 20 kids had it memorized!  The next month we went back to the normal way of reading and at the end of that month the same 3 or 4 kids had it memorized.  When we went back to upside down reading, I introduced a new twist by printing everything out using a, &quot;Sans Forgetica&quot; font.  That font leaves out lots of pieces of letters and forces the brain to work harder to fill in the missing pieces.  Another interesting, unexpected thing happened.  Our little 1st graders who were struggling to read normally, got very good at reading in a very short time.  For the kids, this was a challenge they loved doing but it was also interesting how virtually none of their parents would even try.", "comment_date": "2021-02-16T01:09:00Z", "likes_count": 2}, {"comment_by": "Uncle Ham", "comment_text": "Someone should\u00b4ve seen my face while i was watching this, the amusement!

I like the sound of how your voice inflects when it&#39;s played backwards so when I&#39;d try words backwards I&#39;d remember to try and revers the inflection. Most people breath out and relax posture as the make a statement from start to finish so I&#39;d try to revers that. I was still only 13 or something at the time so I got a kick out of asking my little brother &amp; sister to say words backwards that would have them saying swear words, like &quot;tissue&quot;. <br><br> ...cut me some slack, it&#39;s far less mischievous than many of the other other things I did at that age.

For instance, you cannot talk and read at the same time, due to both using your speech center that processes words.  The exception to this is if you &quot;read in objects&quot;, meaning your brain is processing the words as an image or symbols rather than processing words.  This man likely is processing the words backward using the same part of his brain that processes the music he is playing, meaning the &quot;sound center&quot;is used for both and he is not using his speech center to process the backward word, which would also be why sounds effect his ability to talk backwards as well.  He likely would be able to read one thing and speak another backward at the same time if the words he was speaking were pre-arranged.  Also, if he wasn&#39;t using the same mouth for both, he would be able to speak two sentences at the same time, one forward and one backward, but we can&#39;t really test that since a human only has one mouth.  Just something to think about...<br><br>This is also useful for other things, if you want someones attention away from something, you have to distract that part of the brain.  If someone is speaking and you want them to stop, you make them focus on words, written (unless they are one of the few who use a different part of their brain for this) or spoken.  If someone is focused on touch, you engage a different part of their body using the touch sense (pain, cold, heat, etc.);  If someone is in pain, you can make them forget about that pain, if you overwhelm a different part of their body with this sense.  If someone isn&#39;t to hear something, you create a different sound to focus on.  Music is good for studying, as long as it doesn&#39;t contain lyrics (words), once the words come into play, you can only focus on studying, OR the music.  I cannot type and talk at the same time, but I can write a program and talk at the same time, because typing words and talking use the same part of the brain, but writing computer code uses a different part of the brain.  This is all a result of different parts of our brain, processing different things, but only being able to process ONE thing at a time in each part.

Wouw, cool, I have loads of thoughts / questions! <br><br>1) I would love to have you explore simcomming. Amongst manual language speakers who are able to speak oral languages as well (hearing folks who speak sign languages, for example), there is a thing that is often done, especially in predominately non-Deaf families, called simcomming. It stands for Simultaneous Communication, and it is the attempt to layer two separate languages over top of each other: English and ASL for the case of Anglophone North America (MSL + English or Gaelic, LSQ + French or English, Protactile + English, BASL + English are all common examples as well). It means that when I want to say the English sentence: &quot;When will you be heading to the store? Later today?&quot; I would also (attempt to) say in ASL: &quot;YOU STORE GO. WHEN? \u00a0^^LATER^^?&quot; I myself have become quite competent at basic sentences, but once I get into a full, complex situation it breaks down and either my ASL takes on English grammar or my English takes on ASL grammar. I know other friends of mine who excel at it and can simcom across different languages in different combinations (e.g., BSL + German, ISL + French, Auslan + QC French, etc.)<br><br><br>\u00a02) Without trying to sound like too much a stoner, looking at cannabis&#39; properties of increasing brain stimulation and connections between neurons, I wonder if if you were to get stoned and practise this talking backwards skill versus a sober person, what those results would be. Differences between daily-toker stoner, once-in-a-while stoner and a sober friend because of how cannabinoids effect the brain in different quantities over time scales. If learning is simply the rewiring and redirection of electrical neural impulses, and cannabis pushes that along and puts it into overdrive, could cannabis not be used to help in terms of education of certain tasks or skills? <br><br>3) We know human perception slows down as brain fires off faster as we are able to take in more external input. Bear (Bare?) with me here, but knowing that the faster &quot;data&quot; in the form of light goes, the slower it goes (relatively/relativitively speaking) to the point of being able to travel back in time. Knowing also the human brain capacity to understand and communicate in both directions (shown here). And knowing that human perception slows with greater neural stimulation (e.g., electrical impulses; adrenaline shocks; ...), could in theory a person expand their perception to greater chunks of time to the point of reversal or being able to perceive in either flows?<br><br>Because using these assumptions, the light data transferring between neurons is what limits human brain capacity for perception and skill acquiring (well that and the physical needs that our body provides), and so by increasing the light/data/energy/speed at which the neurons are connected, it would make sense that a property of light\u2013that being the slowing and eventual reversal of time upon increasing the photons&#39; energy\u2013that happens to be the only limiting factor in neural capacity, would mean that increasing that energy means we can perceive time differently. <br><br>To add, it is known that people speaking other languages perceive time differently. Swedes versus Hispanophones were shown to estimate the progression of time differently in different environments (filling a space versus 2D movement). Other languages like Creek have very foreign concepts of time like their ~7 different past tenses (~1hr, bit of time, day, week, month, year, epoch, mythic \u2013\u2013 or so, this is from memory) and manual languages if placing past/future in front of/behind will have different combinations like ASL&#39;s future-forward, past-back or Mayan Sign Language&#39;s future-behind, past-forward. And to finally note, we know that languages change peoples&#39; perceptions of colours from several different Bantu language speakers having different abilities to perceive greens, Hungarians perceiving different types of reds and so on<br><br>Food for thought", "comment_date": "2017-11-30T22:15:05Z", "likes_count": 41}, {"comment_by": "Gustaf H\u00f6eg", "comment_text": "The banjo sounds really freaky backwards XD", "comment_date": "2017-11-30T18:02:09Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Billy Knight", "comment_text": "He sounds like a sim \ud83d\ude02", "comment_date": "2017-11-30T12:29:11Z", "likes_count": 279}, {"comment_by": "nolimeplease", "comment_text": "I so love your videos.", "comment_date": "2017-11-30T03:12:39Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Nick desert", "comment_text": "So cool", "comment_date": "2017-11-30T00:12:10Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "gnikytta m", "comment_text": "This is terrifying.", "comment_date": "2017-11-23T03:12:07Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "jmontyme", "comment_text": "Can you... can you do the pirate thing?", "comment_date": "2017-11-22T19:19:49Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Kevin Yang", "comment_text": "when played in reverse, he also mouths the words correctly as well.

I&#39;m also a really really strange person to begin with, who tends to see things in a peculiar manner, so I like to joke that my brain is on backwards. I just sort of learned how to do it, but it never really required much challenge or thinking or any real kind of practice, even when I was little. I can do it practically instantaneously, since I don&#39;t really have to think about it. It&#39;s sort of like when I switch between English and Spanish (I grew up speaking both), there is no thought and I can seamlessly integrate back and forth in the middle of a sentence. I can think backwards if I want to (although it doesn&#39;t feel natural to\u2013but then again thinking in Spanish feels unnatural when I&#39;ve been in the US and haven&#39;t spoken the language for a while), and I can think backwards in English and in Spanish. I can have conversations backwards, except, of course, no one understands what I&#39;m saying. Interestingly, though, if I spend a long time without doing it (maybe a couple of months), it takes me a few minutes before I can start going at it fluently again. There&#39;s also one thing I can&#39;t do, simply because it&#39;s too much to remember, which is remembering the order of the words. That is, if You record me and play it backwards, You&#39;ll hear all the right words, but You&#39;ll hear them in opposite order. I have to think for a second when I get long words (say 6 syllables or more) or get words in foreign languages or which I don&#39;t recognize. I can do words backwards both phonetically (like Kurt) and based on how they&#39;re spelled. I think when I started I did spellings and it was a few months before I moved on to phonetics. I would get bored in traffic so I would read everything I could see, and then I&#39;d annoy my brothers until they forced me to stop, so out of desperation, I&#39;d read things backwards. As far as I know, I can&#39;t go the other way and understand backwards words, but I&#39;ve never met someone else that can speak backwards so I wouldn&#39;t know. It was strange to me that Kurt had trouble doing it while doing other stuff\u2013for me it&#39;s no challenge at all. If the task is focus-free enough that I can talk while doing it, I can do talk backwards while doing it (although, admittedly, I am terrible at multitasking so there are few things which I can talk while doing).<br><br>Can anybody else do this or something similar?

For my bachelor dissertation I chose to write about Behavioural economics, which is a field of knowledge that brings economics and psicology closer together to investigate decision making! I know it sounds like this has nothing to do with the video but listen to the following! <br>Daniel Kahneman and Amos Tversky formulated a theory in which the human psyche has two systems with which it responds to reality:<br>The fast and intuitive system 1 and the slow, energy-costly system 2. The second is what many people think when they are told Rational thinking which is very sccurste most of the time. However, it uses A LOT of energy and it makes our reactions to be slower! Therefore, System 1 uses shortcuts to create a fast and sometimes accurate response to make the whole system more efficient.<br><br>So, what you where experiencing on the bike when your phone started ringing was your system 2 collapsing and not being able to transfer the bike-riding movement to your system 1! That is exactly what you where trying to do with this guy! You were trying to collapse his System 2 to see if his System 1 could take over the backwards speaking! AMAZING!

As much as you, we were doing some &quot;experiments&quot;, but in brazilian portuguese. And the logic and the mechanics behind it it&#39;s the same. We also tried with some words of the english language and the results were the same too. So the conclusion was the same. But what truly impressed me is the fact that, to me, writing was the true &quot;leap forward&quot;, because the alphabet (and the phonetic one) were truly genious inventions in the sense that they just don&#39;t simply represent a naming convention of things, they accurately represent the sound of such &quot;pieces of the words&quot;, each letter and phonem themselves. It may seem weird to say, because the letters may be &quot;any&quot; for a given one (for example &quot;B&quot; could be &quot;H&quot; or whatever, graphicaly speaking), but no, there is a logic behind the names and sounds. Lets take for example my name: Gabriel, which spelled backwards is Leirbag. If I speak this word exactly the way it is writed, even without thinking about the exact phonetics of it, reading like the letters are in the right order, hearing the recording backwards will reproduce the sound at least 95% equal to the regular one. It&#39;s crazy and wonderful! Of course, I can&#39;t talk an entire phrase backwards like this guy does, he is very well trained, maybe another time, haha! Great video, man!
