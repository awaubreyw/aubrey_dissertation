We have more than a few fire dependent plants on the threatened list and many bird, bug, and mammal species the depend on fire for population dynamics and control.  Is there any way we can take the several millions being spent on one fire event ( example the Canyon Creek Complex fire in Oregon last year that spent over a million a day of fire suppression) and use that economic resource for ecosystem health and restoration such as thinning and prescribed fire?
