The entry wound was a barely-visible pinprick between my ring and pink fingers, but within only a few seconds I felt pain radiating up my arm and to my shoulder. I&#39;ve heard the pain described as burning, but the best way I can think of to describe it is if my arm was encased in concrete that was somehow squeezing tighter and tighter, crushing the bones together. You know the feeling when you shut your finger in a door? Imagine that sensation spreading through your arm, and lasting for four hours before it began to fade. This was from a miniscule sting, from a less venomous variety. I can&#39;t imagine what stepping on a stonefish could possibly be like. I&#39;ve heard stories that people will scream for the affected limb to be amputated, and I believe their reactions are completely plausible.All things considered, I would 100% prefer to repeat the experience of being bitten by an annoyed python that didn&#39;t want to get out of our chicken cage.

As they where looking around they found a stone (the stone fish in disguise) which was moving around, they came quickly to a conclusion that it was some sort of a fish so they decided to catch it. They had problems catching it cause it moved quite fast and it camouflaged well, but they managed to catch it in the end, with the help of the stone fish itself. How you might say, well it decided to bit my brothers finger. My cousin and bro took this opportunity to put a plastic pouch (which they brought with them)  over the fish and my bros hand while it was still biting my bros finger. Then my bro kept slamming the fish on a ship (which had anchored nearby), till it finally gave up and released it&#39;s grip. Happily my brother and cousin swam back to land to show off their awesome catch to all nearby kids. My bro bragged about how he would grill it then eat it, but sadly his wish never came true cause shortly after that came the guard who was wondering all the commotion was all about. When he saw the stone fish in the pouch his face went green. He quickly grabbed the pouch threw it on the ground and took a nearby metal beam and punctured it till it stopped moving. Shortly after the guard informed my brother and cousin that the fish was very venomous, then just went on his way. Realizing this my brother and cousin turned extremely sad cause, they found out it was probably not edible and all their efforts went to nought. They also got informed that it was forbidden to fish at the tourist area and the next time they try to fish up any fishes they were to be kicked out.<br><br>In the end my brother and cousin went back dispirited, and throughout rest of the trip they never got as excited again.", "comment_date": "2017-03-04T02:40:03Z", "likes_count": 46}, {"comment_by": "ky ev", "comment_text": "What kind of Hellish place would have creatures like this?", "comment_date": "2017-03-03T23:28:20Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Rinor Redjepi", "comment_text": "looks like lava hound from Clash royale", "comment_date": "2017-03-02T23:46:36Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Joanna Idrovo", "comment_text": "lol at first I&#39;m just wondering how someone could get that stuck in their foot and then I saw the &quot;needle&quot;", "comment_date": "2017-03-02T17:55:08Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "2Cool Cruz", "comment_text": "I have nipples, Greg.

Bondi beach, one of the most popular beaches in australia, sees 5 million visitors each year on average and there are plenty of other beaches that reach similar figures. The coastline of Queensland (the typical holiday destination for people who like the beach) is over 13 thousand kilometres long (13,000km converts to 8,077.8255 miles), and the entire coastline of australia is about 30 thousand kilometres. And besides, if you are visiting further south you won&#39;t even run into these guys, seeing as they only inhabit the tropical waters far north.<br>Australian lifeguards put up signs and may even close beaches if any hazards are present, and the flags that the lifeguards set up for you to swim between\u00a0are put there FOR A REASON. you should be more worried about rip currents and bluebottles than stonefish. Typically the people who get injured on australian beaches are tourists, because they get intimidated by the surf and opt for the calmer waters, which is pretty much the opposite of what you should do. You could get caught in a rip current, which is the number one environmental beach hazard, or you know, if you&#39;re really unlucky you might step on a stonefish.
