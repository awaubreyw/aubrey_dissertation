Isn&#39;t that how they are designed to act once the round strikes its target? From what I understand, rounds are designed to &quot;mushroom&quot; immediately after impact. This is so maximum damage is inflicted. To put this into context, let&#39;s think about hunters and those using weapons for self defense such as police officers or even the person who would like to protect their person, property, and/or home(and possibly their family in it if they have a family). All of these individuals would prefer a round designed so that it &quot;mushrooms&quot; as much as possible so that it inflicts the most damage possible. For hunting, harvesting an animal should be done in the most humane way possible. So, the shot should first be at vital points but at that it should still only take one shot so that the animal suffers the least. To maximize this chance for a &quot;one shot one kill&quot; a round with the maximum stopping power or &quot;mushroom&quot; effect is crucial. Someone using a weapon in self defense of themselves, others, and property must neutralize the threat as quickly as possible. If one uses a bonded jacketed hollow point, such as the 9mm Winchester PDX1 Defender, then the threat is more efficiently neutralized. As for what this man used in the video, if the rounds shown at <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3FkAUbetWU&amp;t=0m28s\">0:28</a> are the same .22 rounds used in the .22 video last made then it is a soft tipped hollow point round. Therefore, it was meant to mushroom and break apart as it made contact.<br><br>As a disclaimer before someone proceeds to retort my use of the 9mm as an example I am fully aware that there are rounds out there with greater stopping power. The .45ACP is one I can come up with right away but there are others I know of as well. Soft tipped rounds are also ones that mushroom once striking a surface. I also know there are rounds that are meant to hold their shape and penetrate the target.", "comment_date": "2017-09-25T07:05:11Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "FarSeeker8", "comment_text": "Weird.

The only way to break the head of the drop is for the pressure applied by the impact to exceed the compressive stress in the glass surface. As the bullets get bigger, the force is also getting spread out over the surface and the net result is still a very low pressure on the PRD surface. Even with a smaller bullet, the contact stress is limited by yield strength of the material, so it will never get higher than the ultimate strength of led, which is fairly low. <br><br>It&#39;s like bolt preload: you torque down a bolt on a fitting and the bolt only sees the preload stress, regardless of the tension applied to separate the fittings, as long as the tension does not exceed the preload. The compression in the glass surface must be exceeded for the glass to break. That requires a large P/A.. so either increase the P or decrease the A. Also, since you are hanging the PRDs from string, the pressure is further limited by inertia transfer during the impulse. The impulse is long with the lead bullets since the entire bullet deforms and melts around the glass, so most of the energy of the bullet is actually accelerating the PRD into kinetic energy. <br><br>I submit that the copper jacket has little effect on the overall material yield strength of the bullet, and the only way you&#39;ll have a chance to crack a PRD with a bullet is by using a steel core/steel shot.  I would not be surprised if a PRD did survive a .50 BMG, as long as the tail stays intact.
