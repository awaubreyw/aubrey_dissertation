So cats are fortunate we have taken the point on this.<br><br>A next-generation space station that gives kitty a <b>choice</b> between full gravity and no gravity is an essential experiment that all humanity demands. I know, I asked everyone. History and the gravitational field are also in complete agreement.<br><br>This station would have a docking hub -- this would be the free-fall part -- and a 100-metre tunnel that, as it leads away from the hub, starts out just going away from it, but pretty soon is clearly going *down*, because the whole system is turning once every 20 seconds. At the end, which is the bottom, there is the main part of the station. The tunnel appears there as a port in the ceiling with a ladder reaching down to the full-gravity floor.<br><br>Rather than expecting cats to climb 100 meters up a ladder (although this will feel like only 50 metres, being at an average of half a gee) there could be a spiral, carpeted catwalk.<br><br><br>Would they explore all the way up, and play in the zero gee at the hub?
