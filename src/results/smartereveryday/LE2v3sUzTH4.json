At this level of magnification, isn&#39;t all color pigments really only a stricture that absorbs &quot;color&quot; on other wave length that what we can see.  White objects reflects all wave lengths, black absorbs all, and various &quot;colors&quot; absorbs some and reflects the wave length of the color we see. I mean the eye only contains a bunch of sensors that reacts to different wave lengths representing the color.  When sensors react to several wave lengths say for blue and yellow, the brain mixes this into green. With a different mixing algorithm we would see a totally different color.   Isn&#39;t it all an illusion.

All codes result from an intentional choice and agreement between sender and recipient\r<br>\r<br>7. The determination of meaning for and from a set of symbols is a mental process that requires intelligence\r<br>\r<br>8. There can be no new information without an intelligent, purposeful sender\r<br>\r<br>9. Any given chain of information can be traced back to an intelligent source\r<br>\r<br>10. Information comprises the non-material foundation for all:\r<br>\r<br>a. technological systems\r<br>\r<br>b. works of art\r<br>\r<br>c. biological systems\r<br>\r<br>Therefore:\r<br>\r<br>1. Since the DNA code of all life is clearly within the definition domain of information, we conclude that there must be a sender\r<br>\r<br>2. Since the density and complexity of the DNA encoded information is billions of times greater than man&#39;s present technology, we conclude that the sender must be supremely intelligent\r<br>\r<br>3. Since the sender must have\r<br>\r<br>a. encoded (stored) the information into the DNA molecules,\r<br>\r<br>b. constructed the molecular biomachines required for the encoding, decoding, and synthesizing process and,\r<br>\r<br>c. designed all the features for the original life forms,\r<br>\r<br>We conclude the sender must be purposeful and supremely powerful.\r<br>\r<br>4. Since information is a non-material fundamental entity and cannot originate from material quantities, we conclude that the sender must have a non-material component\r<br>\r<br>5. Since information is a non-material fundamental entity and cannot originate from material quantities, and since information also originates from man, we conclude man&#39;s nature must have a non-material component (spirit)\r<br>\r<br>6. Since information is a non-material entity, we conclude that the assumption &quot;the universe is comprised solely of mass and energy&quot; is false.\r<br>\r<br>7. Since:\r<br>\r<br>1) biological information originates only from an intelligent sender and,\r<br>\r<br>2) all theories of chemical and biological evolution require that information must originate solely from mass and energy alone (without a sender), we conclude that all theories or concepts of biological evolution are false.\r<br>\r<br>Anyone who disagrees with these laws and conclusions must falsify them by demonstrating the initial origin of information from purely material sources. Therefore, the laws of nature about information have: 1. refuted the assumption of scientific materialism and the theories of chemical and biological evolution 2. all philosophies or theories based on the assumption of scientific materialism including chemical and biological evolution are falsified by the laws of nature about information.", "comment_date": "2020-02-17T06:09:32Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Ansh Mehra", "comment_text": "This was beautiful!", "comment_date": "2020-02-17T04:41:35Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Namra \u0646\u0645\u0631\u06c1 \u06be\u0627\u0634\u0645\u06cc", "comment_text": "God is the Most Wise, the All-Knowing....", "comment_date": "2020-02-17T04:34:23Z", "likes_count": 8}, {"comment_by": "Eileen Ger", "comment_text": "yep.....and it all just happened by accident when way back when \u2026..nothing created everything", "comment_date": "2020-02-17T00:47:15Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Justin Masters", "comment_text": "Hair type things are usually sensory.

What is the exact process of life creation? There is a lot of atheist theories about this. One of the most popular is &quot;a long chemical chain reaction&quot;, which I think is not entirely bad, because it&#39;s obvious that over a long time period, there is a long chemical chain reaction happening of planets composed of a wide variety of materials, and myself was sticking to this theory for several years. But if you really take a moment to look at the structure of many life forms like we can see in this video, it became obvious that all living organisms are amazing pieces of nanotechnology and also sometimes, amazing art masterpieces. It now seems to me much more logical that if organisms (life) is a technology and art pieces, it must certainly be created, engineered by something able to think. Can&#39;t you see how amazing and how complex it is inside of us? We are definitely something&#39;s technology! But what this is and what is it&#39;s origin?

Yet we understand concepts like this in great detail just by running the evolutionary clock backwards, and recreating natural selection in our models. I could speculate that the nanostructure in the hairs is a direct result of the structure surrounding it having evolved, the pits on the wing being a precursor to the structure of the hairs. The pattern closely resembles the structure which the butterfly was already using on its wings, so it is easier for a dust particle from the wing to evolve into a small hair, retaining the same structure than it would be to start all over and create a hair in the way humans do (by stacking dead proteins). In fact, I&#39;d be willing to bet that someone has already solved this problem. There is no problem that is beyond scientific inquiry, and given enough time we can solve almost all of them.

The author seems to suggest that this is associated with incredible amounts of &quot;information&quot; or &quot;energy&quot;, which is somehow excessive for its purpose. <br><br>But to me, there are many phenomena in nature that are associated with complicated structures (take snowflakes for instance). In many cases, these structures arise due to instabilities. Think of, for example, Rayleigh-Taylor (RT) instability where a smooth boundary is disrupted. But it&#39;s a silly point to say, &quot;why does nature do such excessively complicated things with planar (or smooth) boundaries&quot; in regards the RT instability.<br><br>Other examples include spot formation on animal coats. Although this might have been partly evolutionary, there are also mechanical and chemical reasons for spot formation due to instabilities (Turing instabilities for example). Again, it is false to propose that a smooth and unvarying coat is the &#39;natural&#39; one. Nature tells us otherwise. The &#39;natural&#39; coat may have patterns because this may be the stable configuration.<br><br>The main point I&#39;m making is that the author suggests that somehow &#39;simplicity&#39; (a smooth wing attachment, for instance) is somehow natural, whereas complexity is unnatural.

Yellow colour is separated from the light because of destructive interference given by phase difference of light reflected from different spots of the &quot;baffled nanostructure&quot;.<br><br>Yes width of 575 nm would suggest constructive interference (enhancement) of the colour someone might concur - the phase difference would be in whole wavelengths. But what I think is this might be a bit of coincidence as the key dimension is length between those &quot;tree branches&quot; (different heights they are in) - if they are 1/4 of a wavelength apart (as from the picture in the video might be the case - if it is in scale) then light reflected from some branch travel just 1/2 of a wavelength shorter distance than light reflected from one just below it - and thus creating destructive interference - the light cancel itself out. Light of different wavelength have different phase difference and is not affected by the structure as much or at all.<br><br>I might be wrong, but that is what I was told some time ago and since I study optics (as PhD student) I do incline to such explanation. It does quite fit. - Maybe a motivation for further investigation.
