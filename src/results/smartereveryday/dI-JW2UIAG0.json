[{"comment_by": "SmarterEveryDay", "comment_text": "I would like to point out several things: <br>1. Luke Talley is awesome.<br>2. Every single frame of this video requires more memory storage than this memory module is capable of handling.  Think about that.<br>3. On the second channel we talk about things like how they took into account gyroscopic precession with this bad boy. They also crashed this into the moon and used the signal as a way to figure out what the inside of the moon is like.  It&#39;s a good video, you should consider watching it. ( <a href=\"https://youtu.be/6mMK6iSZsAs\">https://youtu.be/6mMK6iSZsAs</a> )<br>4. This is not the Apollo computer.  This is the Saturn V computer.  They&#39;re different.  This steered the rocket.<br>5. People that support Smarter Every Day on Patreon are really cool and I like them a lot.

I would think that bit of information would be relevant. You would think since in the past 10 years with talks, documentaries, books and movies that have come out about women being a fundamental part of NASA, as well mas the computer field. Like for example, the ENIAC computers that were used during the Manhattan Project to calculate the amount of nuclear material needed to built the first atomic bombs, for example, women mathematicians were the ones that did the actual program of the UNIVAC switches. Which this goes to the 2nd thing that made me laugh was when Linus made the comment about that the women who did the threading of the memory bits had a textile background. Now, I saw laugh, but I&#39;m being very sarcastic. To me, that shows how lacking Linus&#39; knowledge about computing is. At that particular time, if anyone were to being working on building computers, textile workers would be THE LAST people, since computing work crossed over into national security. So, it was always the default program to have college-educated people with degrees in science and mathematics, working in those areas.

My hat  is off to the engineers and mathematicians who guided Apollo to it&#39;s lunar landing and back home safely. The advances in my life time alone (and I am only 64) are absolutely amazing.

I worked on an IBM 1620, a 1401 and others, including a minicomputer made by a company called Microdata, which all used core memory.  (I&#39;m 72.) <br><br>I still have three 8K memory boards from that Microdata computer.  (Failure of this type of memory was common, so I decided to save boards when they were replaced.)  I remember they were priced at $3,500 each back then, or around 5 cents/bit.  At that rate, 16GB of RAM (128 billion bits), now commonplace in PC&#39;s, would cost 6.4 billion dollars (without accounting for inflation)!  That&#39;s over double the entire Apollo program budget.  (Good thing they didn&#39;t need 16GB.)<br><br>Just as shown in this video, I can see the little cores arranged on the grid of wires. I was amazed back then, and I still find it impressive today.  Here&#39;s an interesting fact about core memory:  In order to read a bit, the computer would actually write a zero at that location.  A sense wire running through all the bits on that plane would detect a pulse if that location originally contained a 1 because reversing the magnetic direction would induce that electric pulse. A second cycle was then required to restore the bit back to a 1 (or leave it as 0 if no pulse was detected).  This was known as &quot;destructive&quot; read, requiring two machine cycles.  One cycle on the Microdata was one microsecond (1 MHz).  A modern CPU running at 4GHz is 4,000 times faster.  But one cool thing:  if the computer lost power, core memory was preserved!  It wasn&#39;t 100% reliable, but often, when the computer was powered back on after a power failure, it could continue running where it left off!  <br><br>Anyway, I am wondering what to do with these memory boards.  Right now, they&#39;re just gathering dust in my closet.

That video implied that the actual data was encoded in the wiring patterns. Such that if you wanted a bit &quot;ON&quot; you wire it one way and if you wanted a bit &quot;OFF&quot; you wired it a different way. I did not believe that for a minute. I was a computer science student in the early 70s in the days when mainframe computers had iron core memory and I knew that it was a programmable memory and not a ROM. It&#39;s hard enough to wire up those cores but the idea that they were looking at some sort of data dump with binary code and hardwiring the data into the cores seemed ridiculous to me. Your revelation that each time you read one of the cores you had to rewrite it to re-magnetize the core confirms for me but also this was mostly a read-only memory, that the actual program was not physically hardwired into it but was somehow programmed into it like a ROM memory. Can you confirm that the cores were all wired identically and then somehow programmed once assembled and that the program itself was not handwoven into the hardware?", "comment_date": "2019-08-14T22:28:25Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Graham", "comment_text": "All of this type of video merely illustrate how far technology has come since 1969, and thus the ever growing question of why exactly ZERO people have made it past LEO since these stories of them doing so.", "comment_date": "2019-08-14T19:55:36Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "gk10002000", "comment_text": "I can&#39;t believe this computer geek had never heard of the computer history of this.

(Yes, I really dont like subscribing to channels &amp; it obviously takes me a LOT to do so) You also seem like a real nice, kind guy which is also 50% of my conditions when subscribing to someone, BUT, LinusTechTips.... well that guy is a CREEP &amp; the BIGGEST LIAR IVE EVER SEEN! He is the worst type, a &quot;PAID&quot; Liar, the most misleading &amp; disgusting vid he&#39;s done was the HTC Vive Pro, &amp; to anone that isnt a VR user or who doesnt own the Vive &quot;Pro&quot; (not the standard Vive but the Pro) they probably believed his Lies about it, but, the SICK truth about his video (&amp; sooooo many of his other videos) is he Slammed, mocked &amp; basically Destroyed and &amp; all positives about the BEST VR headset ever, &amp; its better by a long shot, as in 200% (literally) &amp; this was all (&amp; he admitted this too btw) simply because Vive didnt give him one for Free! So he held the biggest grudge ever &amp; had a mission to Misinform ALL his faithful followers &amp; EVERYONE watching just to see what the Vive Pro was like, Im 100% certain Vive would have lost several sales because of this little Liar too which disgusts me for one main reason, you see the first VR headsets are pretty terrible when it comes to visual quality, especially &quot;Resolution&quot;, everything is VERY blocky &amp; very blurry &amp; there is a BAD &quot;Screen door&quot; effect (like looking through fly-screen because u can see the lines in-between pixels due to low resolution) the Vive Pro attempted &amp; succeeded in literally reducing this by Half! They also made it much more accessible with the built-in headphones like the Occulus had &amp; a few other needed features, the resolution was a lot higher &amp; the screen quality &amp; amount of pixels were a lot better making it by FAR the best VR headset available, Linus however went on about how he didnt receive one for &quot;Free&quot; &amp; even went as far to title his video to say &quot;Why does this exist&quot; &amp; proceeded to tell EVERYONE that it was the worst, most useless &amp; pointless VR headset ever made, EVERYTHING in his video was110% the Exact OPPOSITE of the truth, showing everyone what happens when a spoiled, &quot;Paid Liar&quot; does when you dont give him everything he wants like a horrible, evil, spoiled kid! Seeing Destin have anything to do with someone that is made up of the exact opposite morals &amp; has the opposite agenda, is completely uncaring &amp; unkind compared to Destin makes me as sick &amp; disgusted as Linus&#39;s Vive Pro &quot;I wanted one for free&quot; slam video, its like god working with the devil &amp; thinking the devil is the same as you &amp; just as caring &amp; legit. Its so sad that I CANT watch SmarterEveryDay now because it might feature a con artist liar that will completely mislead &amp; misinform me about everything, which again is the OPPOSITE of why SmarterEveryDay exists, as Linus will make you DumberEveryDay &amp; MisinformedEveryDay. PLEASE Destin, you NEED to distance yourself for this little speed freak (he certainly loves his drugs that hype him up &amp; keep him working all night...)if you have him in your videos then you are destroying your channel &amp; your message &amp; I certainly cant watch more of his blatant lies, just watch his Vive Pro video or any other video &amp; look up the real facts &amp; truth &amp; u will see how blatant his lies &amp; misinformation is, I dont know how he has ANY subscribers, but I know ALL of them dont know anything about the products &amp; things he talks about, they just take his word for it &amp; learn the Opposite of what they need to learn.

The sense wire was connected to an LED on the front side of the AGE. Each LED was a test point in the radar equipment. So the theory was that with a quick visual scan of the AGE, one could confirm whether the radar was working properly or malfunctioning and if it was malfunctioning, give the technician (like me) an idea of exactly where the fault was!<br><br>During school on radar equipment while I was using this AGE, I spotted a fault that the instructors had not installed for me to find. The fault that I found, had been caused by instructors repeatedly installing a different particular fault in the particular piece of gear I was working on! They originally were going to fail me on this until I insisted they double check my troubleshooting with measurements of their own. They agreed and I was right. They later told me that, that was the first time in the radar school&#39;s history that that had happened! <br><br>Obviously, I passed radar technician school. But at the time, there was no Bell Curve grading! You either passed or failed! It wasn&#39;t like you could skate by on a &quot;70%&quot; and call it a day. I was getting upset that the instructors were going to initially fail me on that test until my insistance that I was right caused them to take a closer look themselves!<br><br>The fault that I found was related to the generation of a 30 microsecond blanking gate signal for the radar receiver.", "comment_date": "2019-08-08T12:46:40Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "McKevin Dauntless", "comment_text": "I was waiting for linus to drop that.

You spoke of conventional core memory, where X and Y axis wires can be energized to impose a magnetic orientation on a single iron core. A single sense wire passed through all the cores, so writing an opposite value produced an induced spike on the sense wire. Bits were read by writing a known value and watching for the induced kick. No kick, the value was what you wrote, got a kick, you destructively changed what was there.<br><br>But that&#39;s not the end of it. Apollo guidance computers used memory modules that stored four bits per each individual core. You could correctly argue that&#39;s impossible for read-write memory, but the rope core memory wasn&#39;t read-write, it was read-only.<br><br>Instead of high magnetic permeability iron beads (cores), they used permanent magnets. Instead of one sense wire, they used four.<br><br>All the magnets were physically oriented the same way. When a particular X and a particular Y wire were energized, you got (or didn&#39;t get) spikes on each of the four sense wires. The data was encoded by the weave - if a sense wire went through a core at a particular grid location, it represented a one. If it skipped that core, that location was interpreted as a zero. Each tiny bit had X and Y wires passing through it, and also had up to four sense wires. Energize X and Y for a particular location, read four bits simultaneously. Since the cores were permanent magnets, the write operations weren&#39;t destructive.<br><br>Countless such examples of design creativity hallmark the Apollo project. It&#39;s overwhelmingly sad when people say we never went to the moon. Of course, it&#39;s usually people who can&#39;t balance a checkbook and will never recognize the courage it took to light 7.5 million pounds of thrust, entrusting slide rules and three digits of precision with human lives.<br><br>Of course, that wasn&#39;t really how it worked.

Being familiar with computers and modern technology is not the same thing as having an in depth technical familiarity with the detailed design of computer hardware. <br><br>Most of the tech journalists including LTT, GN, R2C, et cetera are all competent and have connections with industry professionals at intel, AMD, and NvIdia who might appreciate this and be able to have a true detailed discussion that would be amazing, but these are people they are connected with, not the journalists themselves. At the end of the day, a cool video, but I feel like it would have been almost the exact same video without Linus holding the priceless piece of American history adding to the tension given his history with valuable parts....", "comment_date": "2019-08-08T02:00:43Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Nigels Life", "comment_text": "That was a really interesting video.
