Or in a scenario where (not sure of the exact conditions) but could it be possible that the rocks were indeed petrified wood and it was debris from the formation of the moon? Like if there were organics on one of the planets prior and instead of getting insta vaporized, it got ejected into space then came back down and ...idk..hard hard hard to make that one plausible.  Im just trying to find an explanation that could make sense other than the big conspiracy theories.  Any ideas?  I know this will be your perspective and its not 100% fact because you or I were not the ones there so we have to just take testimonials as proof.

If you were to look at it on an model graph all the planets would line up &#39;perfectly&#39; along the vertical access while being &#39;dragged&#39; by the gravity of the sun at over 2 million miles an hour.  So while the sun is travelling in a straight vector, all the planets move in spirals travelling distances exponentially farther than what the sun is travelling meaning we have to be moving at speeds way greater than the sun just to keep up with that &#39;perfect&#39; vertical plane that somehow all the planets move in.  <br><br><br>So it doesn&#39;t matter if your Neptune (way far out there) or mercury (closer to the sun) gravity works on each planet differently (the farther away the planets are the stronger the effect of the gravity of the sun would have be for it to keep things perfectly in line)  but in such a perfect way that ALL planets keep up their speed with the sun, never too fast, never to slow, but just right.  You&#39;d think after billions of years that maybe Neptune or pluto being farthest away from the sun that maybe they would start dragging behind which would alter their orbit slowly but surely.  <br><br><br>Also if the Suns gravity is so strong to drag all the planets along with it, why doesn&#39;t it have any effect at all on our moon, or any of the other planets moons?  So only earths gravity effect the moon, but only the suns gravity effects the earth (no other objects in the Milky way galaxy have any gravitational effect on the earth, or the sun, as if the sun is moving in a perfect vector, there is NOTHING effecting it&#39;s travel.<br><br><br>So either the billions and billions (could be infinite even) factor and exponents involved in the wonderful equation that would model the movement of everything in our galaxy work so perfectly after billions of years, or maybe we&#39;re just not moving at all?

I still remember it to this day, nearly 50 years later. There wasn&#39;t much of it, and it was behind a very thick glass lens (probably under a vacuum considering the thickness of the glass - sadly Dad died over 25 years ago so I can&#39;t ask him more about it).

Today Building 37 is used for biomedical research, but it was the original quarantine building for the returning Apollo astronauts, the moon rocks, and their return capsules.  Just in case there were moon bugs, nobody knew then and they were playing it safe.  The astronauts actually stayed in a modified Airstream trailer just outside the building while the return capsule and moon rocks were processed indoors inside a giant vacuum chamber.  I think the chamber had about a 30 foot ceiling, was maybe 30 feet wide and 100 feet long, more or less, to give an idea of the scale, those are by no means exact numbers.  The vacuum held any potential contaminants inside and helped to prevent any contamination of the returned samples.  There was quite extensive processing done there, most of which is probably lost to history; for example the return capsule was filthy with moon dust and I don&#39;t know what they did with that, but it&#39;s probably being curated as shown in this video with the rest of the moon rocks.  Which is where everything got moved after processing in Building 37.  After Apollo ended and Building 37 was repurposed, the vacuum chamber was converted into lab space for the Cardiovascular Laboratory of NASA&#39;s Space Biomedical Research Institute, which is where I did my postdoc work on cardiovascular countermeasures to the headward fluid shifts astronauts experience in microgravity, and why I know a little bit about this step in the processing of the moon rocks before they got to where they are today.<br><br><br>One day I got to take a tour of the moon rock facility shown in this video, bunny suit and all, with a small group of maybe a dozen people.  We didn&#39;t get quite the VIP treatment these guys did with getting their hands into the box gloves, but it was close.  We were briefed very professionally about the history and purposes of the facility, and were shown around the area of the glove boxes and cutting enclosure.  We did not go into the Vault though, it was closed tight.  When our guide ended her talk we were invited to look around on our own, and I chose to examine the interiors of some of the glove boxes very closely.  I was astounded to see in one of them, a hair.  Just a short piece maybe 2 or 3 inches long.  To be fair it might have come from a cleaning brush or some kind of other tool like that deliberately introduced into the box, although it was not straight but somewhat curly so I don&#39;t think so.  When I pointed out the hair to our guide she became quite embarrassed and flustered about it, and turned our attention elsewhere.  I think she might have headed the place at the time (1990), but I&#39;m not sure about that.  It was one of the more amusing experiences during my time there :-)", "comment_date": "2019-07-11T09:11:45Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "TechMantra", "comment_text": "Great insights as usual.

In that case, it seems like the chemical properties of the sample would still be altered slightly.

On a similar note, I assume that the composition of the surface has to be pretty stable since they were exposed for ages and ages, but is it possible that the insides of the samples could contain compounds that could sublimate when exposed?  Also, nobody seemed to be wearing masks.

Now, nothing to do with her, what happens when 5, 10, 20 years from now, or even clear back since the claim of the first landing of Apollo 11, people have the ability to make daily trips to the moon, and the 100&#39;s of billions of dollars spent on all this nonsense starts to make sense in the fact that this is just one way to hide the ideas that NASA has spent money so carelessly on the most stupid of things that are so not important.... Not to mention, that all this &quot;so claimed&quot; research is hardly ever shared with the public,  and it is like pulling teeth to see anything NASA has done over the past bazillion years... So, as much as I loved my childhood believing all the stories that comes out of NASA, which was wonderful, especially playing with my LEGO bricks... I now ask, what has NASA and JPL done? or what have they done for me, or the people of the nation, never mind the rest of the world. For almost 60 years, NASA and other&#39;s have claimed to be doing science up in space, and &quot;LEARNING STUFF&quot;.... like what? nobody at NASA will ever answer me... After 10 years of trying to get answers as to what and how they do, what ever it is they do, I have yet to get an answer, which is heart breaking. One of the last people I spoke with 20 years ago, lied right to my face ,upon several subject matters. Since, I no longer believe NASA has done a single thing, and they have now mentioned that they are under no obligation to explain anything of the past to me of what they have claimed they have learned, let alone, if anything at all....  NASA has done this, ruined my dreams from when I was a child. I do not care to see the stupid and or silly trick of floating water being sucked up by a straw, as they have done that uncountable times, I am sorry, if that is all they have come up with, is sucking water through a straw, I would like my tax dollars back. <br><br><br>What has NASA learned? What has NASA done for the people, that cost trillions of dollars? Yes, I am disgruntled, as I feel like I have been robbed... &quot;Moon rocks&quot; that get better care then homeless people?.. those moon rocks could have feed a few million people for 20 years...", "comment_date": "2019-07-10T13:18:27Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Radish", "comment_text": "That you took 4 years to publish this video is disrespectful to the wonderful people who spent time with you that day.", "comment_date": "2019-07-10T13:18:27Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Kanav Sharma", "comment_text": "At <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QxZ_iPldGtI&amp;t=14m54s\">14:54</a> ,,,LOL high tech facility but human error they got the wrong no it 259 ,254 is on left side", "comment_date": "2019-07-10T13:18:23Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Jamie Lancaster", "comment_text": "Are you kidding me?
