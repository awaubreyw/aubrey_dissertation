Now you run into a different problem entirely, which is the effect of shooting a wider real FOV through the 2nd lens, which is likely to have a significant reduction in linear resolution compared to the first lens used. Even if the camera used is the same and distortion effects from vibration, thermal and refraction-index variations are neglected.

Even in 2018.<br>Because you made this video. When, very simply, you could easily have just asked yourself a simple question:<br><br><br>What do I qualitatively gain from shooting &amp; rendering in 4k instead of 1080p or even 720p?<br>Not to mention 4k-60 vs 720p-30?<br><br><br>Apparently this question either never occurred to you or was insufficiently interesting to you. <br><br><br>Here&#39;s my simple response. I realize that this will be rebuffed for predictable reasons but still. <br>The difference in resolution between 4k and 1080p is imperceptible to the human eye unless and until you get so close to the display medium that it IS perceptible. But a) now you can only see a small fraction of the entire image B) even so the files are 8x the size even with the latest &amp; greatest compression (H.265) and it is simply so much easier and faster to shoot &amp; render in 1080p or 720p than 4k that 2 attempts were enough to dissuade ME. Obviously not you but still.<br><br><br>Basically as a mathematician and an engineer, the real issue is why do something in a way that is very difficult and takes a lot of time &amp; effort when you can easily figure-out how to accomplish the same goal, or very near to it, with a lot less time &amp; effort...not to mention cost?  Choosing between 4k and any of a number of lower resolutions really does not require a Mensa certificate. Now of course if you&#39;re talking about 8k, that&#39;s entirely different ;)<br><br><br>The rest of it, if you&#39;d ever done any real work in the field of parallel and  distributed processing, you&#39;d know that very well. And you don&#39;t need a computer for that either. It&#39;s pretty damm hard (not quite impossible but still difficult) to write two letters by hand at the same time. Can it be done? Of course. Is it a wise use of time, effort and resources to do so? Probably not until the required production becomes very large. Need more examples?<br><br><br>Honestly I see you put a whole lot of effort into this video with a lot of angst driving it but very little thought into the actual problem.

Yeah obviously there are some constraints and caveats about what model should be used for your task. The cheaper your build the more important it gets. However especially for higher prices builds there are just very few rules which are important for choosing correct hardware for your use. And if you invest the extra (you pay puget) into the hardware probably it will be faster for any normal task (video editing and rendering included). And unlike stated in the video, yes if you go higher priced you get a better performance. <br><br><br><br>The reason for that is very simple, all common PC hardware is just still multipurpose hardware. And yes there is a trend to have hardware acceleration for some tasks, like e.g. video decoding. However you will find video decoding in just about any GPU. Everything else like video editing or rendering is either dependent on the CPU or at most the GPU, but even the GPU is more or less a multi purpose device (especially used for non live rendering). The are different reasons for why there is not more hardware acceleration around: One is that many algorithms e.g. for encoding are very complicated, so are much harder to be implemented in hardware than in software. Also there are constant updates, tweaks and changes for e.g. rendering engines. Which are too complicated to be implemented in hardware, alone the amount of configuration which is available makes it ridiculously hard and huge if implemented as a transistor logic. Many effects in video editing don&#39;t even use SIMD, AVX or GPU because even thoose little paralleliztation make it much harder to implement if it is at all possible. There is support for H.265 video encoding by nvidia GPUs and intel CPUs but both hardware implementations in the highest settings are significantly worse than even similarly long running Software Encoding, because the software could be tweaked over time, and some things are just too complicately to implement in hardware.<br><br><br>This was a short information about hardware acceleration, but back to the main topic. There have been just two rules (since AMD Zen 2) for buying high end hardware related to your task:<br>1. For any highend task buy AMD Zen 2, the higher number the better performance. (Except maybe some scientific stuff, with AVX ...)<br>2. Buy NVidia and not AMD<br><br><br>And for everything else just look for the highest number in the data sheet and you got the best PC. Are there some more factors which could be important? Yes there are, there can be some considerations be made about whether to buy one or more GPUs and wheter to buy Quadro of GeForce. But for the extra Puget charges you probably can buy one or two extra Geforce GPUs anyway. So I am pretty sure that for at least non scientific work loads the extra Puget charges and does is not worth it. And any other more basic considerations for high end workstations should be doable by any builder of high end machines. <br><br>So I don&#39;t have anything against their buisness model, however I really dislike their claim/marketing that the hardware selection is that important and the amount of detail put into it is really not neccessary.", "comment_date": "2019-08-10T02:28:44Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Saad Alfouzan", "comment_text": "When I see a kid seat, I imeadiately trust him on my life... not only my pc", "comment_date": "2019-08-09T22:07:21Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Steve", "comment_text": "Really Puget ? a TR 1920 ???? why not a TR1950, intel must come out first ?", "comment_date": "2019-08-09T20:17:05Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Kadam Alibakhsh", "comment_text": "Linus will try and overclock it LMFAO", "comment_date": "2019-08-09T18:56:28Z", "likes_count": 5}, {"comment_by": "BleedingRaindrops", "comment_text": "Alright Destin, I&#39;m trusting you, and I&#39;m going to try a Casper mattress.

If you are stuck on disk transfer rate, some of the cores are idle, if the software cant parallel-ize what its doing properly, some will be idle, and if there is some other shared resource that the cores are all competing for, it wont run at full capacity. Rendering involves reading from disk, decompressing, blending/compositing, interpolating, recompressing and then writing back out to disk - which requires a ton of data to be moved around. Each time you solve one bottleneck you will expose the next one. Their approach to benchmarking is the way to go, especially for mostly single use machines. They are basically &quot;tuning&quot; your computer for the intended use. Software engineers do the same with intended use patterns for common use scenarios.

However not having the resources to do massive amounts of speculative benchmarking there was a lot of guessing and googling involved. A lot of our customers also had their own homegrown software they needed to run, and finding out just how that software worked was often a nightmare. <br><br><br>Imagine a company needing a machine to run simulations of radio antenna, and the software used was developed in house. You have to find out how well it takes to being parallelized in the current version, and how hard it would be for them to rewrite for increased parallelization. Can the workload even be distributed to a cluster, or could it be rewritten to run on a GPU or even a GPU cluster? How much memory does it need, and how bandwidth intensive is it. Is the storage bandwidth and latency critical or would it be happy running of a tape drive from 1980?<br>In the end we managed to cut their simulation time radically. The test simulation took something like 11 hours on their old beast of a machine, but only about 20 -  30 minutes on the new machine, and it wasn&#39;t even that exotic.<br><br><br>One thing I never would allow was a machine throttling. We did a lot of testing to find out what kind of loads would stress the components the most. Components like the CPU, memory and the GPU was stressed both individually with targeted loads and in parallel to make sure the machine wouldn&#39;t overheat. Every machine also had to survive 24 hours in 40\u00b0C under full load without throttling before I would sign off on it.<br><br><br>Things like that kept companies coming back for their next machine or machines, but it also meant our computers tended to cost a fair bit more than the competition.", "comment_date": "2018-10-30T17:00:41Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Kermeliz", "comment_text": "Should have bought AMD cpu<br><br>intel is trash.", "comment_date": "2018-10-30T16:55:58Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "J H", "comment_text": "GPU is increasingly becoming the way to go for rendering.

Also ... in the past I have seen several computers develop erratic behavior which was a massive pain to troubleshoot. They appeared to have weird power issues, after a LOT of time and replacing components to test them  (and out of desperation) I developed my own hair-brained theory. With it sitting on carpet, the nearby foot traffic and scrubbing on the carpet was inducing static electricity into the chassis. I have no idea if this was physically correct BUT after placing the chassis on an insulator the problems went away. I have lost count of how many times I &quot;fixed&quot; someone&#39;s computer by getting it off the carpet. In a video editing machine, an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure.\r<br>\r<br>Food for thought on the subject of video encoding: Have you considered building a local (in-home with what you have available) render farm or community render farm with any of your subscribers who also own After Effects and Media Encoder CC? <br><br>Hopefully Media Encoder CC will soon support full use of multiple GPUs (they may in the current version but if so I&#39;m unaware that&#39;s fully implemented and supported) but until they do....the network rendering route may be a viable solution (or at the very least, you may be able to use your old machine with your new one on your local network.) to give you an extra performance boost.<br><br> I use multiple PC&#39;s with multiple GPU&#39;s to render scenes cooperatively on my local network with Blender (which I&#39;m still horrible with but perpetually learning to use). The performance increase with mutli-PC network rendering was about 48% (almost cut my render times in half. I know it&#39;s apples and oranges but Media Encoder CC should still be able to see significant performance increases as well). I can&#39;t speak to the performance increase of network rendering of ME CC but if you have an extra computer on the network or other owners of the software willing to cooperate, it&#39;s at least worth looking into...especially if it saves you more time and potentially allows you to push your video quality a bit farther.<br><br>Love your content.

It&#39;s THE best way to do it, not only do you get exactly what you want, but you can do it much cheaper if you select all the parts yourself.  Also, you will get to know your computer much better and with a little research, you can even fix it when it has problems.  I have always fixed my own, and all my friends sadly (don&#39;t tell anyone you know what you&#39;re doing!)<br><br>I plan on doing a new upgrade after 8 years as computer parts have FINALLY come down in price, no thanks to all the bitcoin farmers.  I plan to do more 3D rendering with Blender (free 3D software, check it out) which will use all of the cores in your CPU as well as all the processing power of your GPU, one or the other in v2.79, BOTH in the newer 2.80 when it is released.<br><br>Oh, and to answer the question as to why an 8 core CPU is faster than a 12 core, well, I noticed the 12 core was an AMD that didn&#39;t have hyperthreading.  The 8 core CPU was an INTEL which has hyperthreading.  The difference is t hat with the AMD 12 core CPU, each CPU can do one task at a time, or a single thread.  The Intel&#39;s hyperthreading can do 2 threads (or &quot;tasks&quot;) at a time, so that 8 core Intel with hyperthreading is like having a 16 core CPU, which should give you a clue as to why it is faster than t he AMD.<br><br>Now newer AMD CPUs will have hyperthreading, and AMDs tend to be cheaper, so keep an eye out for that.  The main thing you want to look for is how many threads can each core handle, then do the math. <br><br>Also, graphic cards have come a long way as well and can do amazing computing (it&#39;s why bitcoin farmers were buying them up which drove their price up).  Even with all those cores in a CPU, when given a choice, you want to go with a good GPU (graphic processor or graphic card) instead as it can do MUCH better, at least when it comes to 3D rendering.  Blender is kewl as it will literally show you, on screen what each core is rendering with a tiny box.  But CPUs can only handle a small amount of data, a graphic card&#39;s GPU can handle a massive amount all at once.  <br><br>Of course, for a gaming system, multicore CPUs don&#39;t really improve things, you want a good graphic card and lets not forget memory.  The more memory in the fewer number of memory chips the better.  If you want 16G of RAM, i recommend two 8G chips instead of four 4G chips for speed.<br><br>Also, a faster hard drive, like a solid state drive (SSD) can be good for specific tasks.  Some people buy a smaller SSD just for the operating system and a larger HDD for everything else, it equals a faster bootup time.  For video editing it might be a little faster to have a dedicated SSD just for your videos for faster loads and saves.<br><br>Don&#39;t cheap out on case fans either.

Normally they have a lower clock speed to keep power within a certain tdp and software support. The software has to support multiple cores. Some do and some do not. <br><br>In the case of not supporting a lot of cores, less cores running faster typically will rule the day. The i9 9900k has a base clock but will turbo boost to certain speeds depending on core use, same with AMD processors. However Intel does have a clock speed advantage. By that I mean Intels CPUs can clock higher. On that CPU all cores being maxed out will run at 4.7ghz while 4 would be 4.8ghz and 2 run at 5ghz. The Ryzen 1920x, a 12 core CPU, on the other hand can only run all cores at 3.7ghz. That&#39;s a 1ghz drop from the i9 and it makes a difference.<br><br>As well some software can utilize GPUs for rendering which is vastly faster.<br><br>For multiple cores the best area is typically servers as they are normally relegated to VM systems where you assign cores to do certain VMs. For example you have a single 24 core server and you split it into 6 4 core VM systems so each VM uses 4 cores to run and as well split the memory and disk space ect.<br><br>They are right that it does depend on the task you are doing but also budget.

I have a few issues with the selection of CPU they went with here. According to Puget&#39;s own testing of core performance in Adobe Premiere, 1080p rendering doesn&#39;t utilize more than about 8 cores (even for very complex timelines), and 4k rendering doesn&#39;t utilize more than 10 cores (actual parallelization above 8 cores in any encoding scenario in Premiere is abysmal, and generally not worth it). So, in summary, Premiere is not very efficient above 6 cores, and it drops off to nearly nothing in pretty much all cases about 10 cores. ...And they spec&#39;d an i9-7980XE 18 core cpu, with a single thread PassMark of 2342. This chip is about $2000 USD, and literally 1/2 of the cores will NOT be effectively used by Premiere. The i9-9900K is $1000, single thread rating of 2906, and 8 cores. Premiere will definitely be able to take maximum advantage of those cores, and each core is 24% faster than the chip that costs twice as much. The 9900k uses about 1/2 the electricity and produces about 1/2 the heat, so you save money in multiple ways short term and long term. How about sum $1000 for the non-baller renderers out there? For $480, you can get the i7-8086K with 6 cores, and single thread of 2846, or for $410 you can get an i7-9700k, 8 cores single thread rating 2788. Their per thread performance is within 3%, and the extra two cores will only be utilized in very complex timelines and 4k (1080p won&#39;t really see much difference about 5-6 cores, ever). SO... It&#39;s kind of a toss-up on these two.<br>There are more than 30 CPUs on the PassMark site listing better per-thread performance than the one Puget speced on this computer, and pretty much every single one of them cost FAR less. So, if you are going to build your own computer, and don&#39;t want to throw away your money, NEVER just blindly follow a build guide somebody made. For that more than $1000 price difference in CPU cost alone, you can get a better SSD, or a better video card, or make an extra mortgage payment on your house and save hundreds of extra dollars in interest on your loan.", "comment_date": "2018-10-27T15:14:47Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "JerryRigEverything", "comment_text": "I caught that Lego reference!!

I have to wonder out loud a bit... but what on earth about rendering is disrupting your daily life?  You hit &#39;go&#39; and let the system do its thing.  You don&#39;t watch the system render for 9 hours I hope lol.  Back when I did video editing in high school on my Pentium 2 it would take the better part of a week to render a 15 minute video.  That was no excuse to bow out of family or school activities lol.<br>If it is about production, and editing multiple videos at a time, you have to ask yourself if it is more efficient to get 1 faster system, or invest in a 2nd system, so one can &#39;cook&#39; while the other is actively being used to edit.  Or with Adobe&#39;s software you set it up to off-load rendering jobs and invest in a small server to send render jobs to while you edit your next project on your main rig.<br><br>Also, while Puget&#39;s bench-marking is good, like all bench-marking it is only for a single use case.  For example; why does Adobe run faster on a smaller CPU? Because it does not take advantage of the extra cores of a high end processor and the fewer cores you have, the easier it is to overclock it.  BUT, what are you giving up by going with the smaller chip?  While the system is rendering you could use extra cores to import your next job.  You could trans-code other projects.  Just because YOU can&#39;t work on more than one thing at once does not mean your computer cant.  And is Adobe&#39;s core limit something set in stone?  They could drop an update one day and utilize more cores and then you loose capability on multi-tasking AND rendering time.<br><br>Another thing that Puget does that really bothers me, is that they essentially sell overpriced game rigs, slap in a quatro, and call it a professional workstation, when that is really not true.  Will it run faster than, lets say, a xeon based workstation from a major brand like Dell or HP?  Yes.  But at the same time, almost anyone can build a similar product themselves for a small fraction of the cost.  But a true workstation is more about reliability and service of a system than simply having something fast.  A workstation is going to have hardware redundancy to prevent data loss with at least a RAID array and ECC memory (if not dual PSUs).  And workstation class support means that when you have a problem, someone comes to your place of business and fixes is within 24 or 48 hours rather than you packing up your glorified game rig and sending it away for a few days.<br><br>Anywho; for people watching this video, and wanting a similarly capable rig I would suggest either going with a local botique shop (because botiques like Puget are not bad if you can get local support), or going with a major brand like Dell, HP, or (*shivers*) Apple.", "comment_date": "2018-10-27T10:11:50Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "PropulsiveFox", "comment_text": "Really want to see whats in your computer. maybe to help somebody to build rendering pc", "comment_date": "2018-10-27T10:11:10Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Joseph Hartley", "comment_text": "Do a collab with Linus Tech Tips", "comment_date": "2018-10-27T10:11:07Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "mercwnz", "comment_text": "And eventually, less time rendering would be spent on more time editing the video.

That&#39;s because what Puget systems do, isn&#39;t out of your reach if like i said you&#39;re interesting in learning all that yourself. Choosing the best combination of parts for your use case doesn&#39;t get much more complicated than knowing whether you&#39;re going to do gaming or streaming or rendering and look up a few benchmarks of cpus and gpus.<br><br><br>I won&#39;t go in too much detail because just as they say in the video, every combination of computer parts has a specific task at which it&#39;s best, and knowing every combination and what each one is best at, isn&#39;t the most worthwhile thing to do, unless you&#39;re a tech enthusiast like me and you actually enjoy knowing all that.<br><br><br>Examples:<br>If you really want to push it though, it can get very complex. For eg you can make your pc optimized for specific games/rendering programs. If you like to play an older game, you&#39;re going to prefer to have a cpu that&#39;s said to have a high single thread performance (or single core perf), because older games weren&#39;t coded to leverage several cores or even know about the existence of more than 1 core. More recent games however are capable of leveraging 4 6 or 8 cores, with multithreading, so you&#39;re going to be able to buy a high core-count cpu that&#39;s going to be really good for your specific games as well as stream or rendering, which is really good if you want one single pc that can do everything really well.\r<br>Then there&#39;s the graphics card and the bottlenecks between the gpu and the cpu, where you have to know if you&#39;re not buying an overkill processor compared to your graphics card, or vice versa. Buying a 1200\u20ac gpu and pair it with a 350\u20ac cpu is nonsense, UNLESS you&#39;re going to do Adobe premiere rendering, because that program uses the graphics card to render, not the processor. <br>And then, scientific use case.. This one is more complicated, because you have to also factor in the operating system, windows vs linux. That&#39;s because when you do scientific research, you use many many programs, and they&#39;re ALL extremely optimized for what they do (unless 99% of regular consumer programs). So one program might be able to leverage 16, 32, or even 64 cores, with hyperthreading, so 32 64 or 128(256) threads. But, windows sucks at using more than 8 cores, because of the infamous scheduler, whereas linux doesn&#39;t have that problem.<br><br><br>So you can see depending on how specific what you do is, and how good you want your pc to be at it, things can get really complex. And that&#39;s mostly where Puget Systems comes in and finds its place. If you want a beast of a gaming pc, even if you really know nothing whatsoever about pc tech, it takes a 5min google search to find all the gaming-oriented components and then you choose based on your budget.", "comment_date": "2018-10-27T03:28:45Z", "likes_count": 8}, {"comment_by": "Digetter", "comment_text": "I\u2019ve never had to render a video before but doesn\u2019t a computer do that by itself?

That&#39;s why you have so many people who just buy whatever Dell or HP display model is being shown at Best Buy or Office Max, and why system builders like Puget, Alienware, IBuyPower, or OriginPC exist at all.  \r<br>\r<br>So this is to any of you out there, who may be in the market for a new PC and are thinking about buying a new computer.  Don&#39;t.  Don&#39;t do it.  Spend a little time to figure out what you need, and how to put it together.  Then buy all the parts and put it together yourself.  Your&#39;e not only going to save yourself a couple hundred bucks but it will also give you a more customized fit for exactly what you need out of your computer.", "comment_date": "2018-10-27T02:42:58Z", "likes_count": 15}, {"comment_by": "Narongkij Tejasakulsin", "comment_text": "Great video!
