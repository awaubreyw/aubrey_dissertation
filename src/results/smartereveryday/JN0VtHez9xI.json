I&#39;m afraid of the Amazon Basin anyway due to those giant  anacondas, hoards of mosquitoes, which I detest and other scary animals down there like big Jaguars, electric eels and piranhas,  bullet ants, foot-long biting centipedes, etc.!

I&#39;ve seen those in eaves and in and around woodpiles all my life.  Then, I got bit by a BW spider on my foot, and I was concerned because my physician father had a patient die from a Black Widow Spider bite.  The man had a bad allergic reaction.  He worked in a dairy and the spider was in his dairy boot, he put his boot on, got bit, felt it, shook the &quot;shiny black spider&quot; out of his boot and thought nothing of it.  But he got terrible belly cramps, sicker, and by the time he got to the hospital, his abdomen was as hard as a board and his back curved out, my Dad said.  Doctors tried everything but it was too late.   But I knew to treat my bite and watch it, it got red and swelled a bit, I iced it and elevated it and in a few hours it was almost normal again.  Of course, the black widow may not have injected much venom, nonetheless, I was a bit concerned.  Now, I am sure I won&#39;t visit the Amazon, too many snakes, spiders and I don&#39;t know what else deadly animal exists there!  Guess it&#39;s a good thing I did my world traveling before I knew about some of these things!  There&#39;s a couple of other spiders like the Brown Recluse (mostly South Central U.S.)and the Yellow Sac (mostly NorthEastern U.S. but they could be in any State) that are venomous, but I have never even SEEN either the Brown Recluse or the Yellow Sac spiders, not in the NorthWest U.S.A. where I live!  I&#39;m not really afraid of spiders, but I just don&#39;t want them ON me, and I sure don&#39;t want to get bit by one!<br>I spent almost 45 minutes once, bent over watching a common orb spider spin her web from beginning to end, in a bush in my front yard.  it was fascinating.  But watching from a foot away is a lot different than finding one on you; once one fell down from the ceiling on my bed once landing on my arm -- I almost had heart failure!  Now, I&#39;m always checking the ceiling!   I live in the country and they can get in through the smallest places, in spite of screens, etc...  I keep an eye out for spiderwebs in my house all the time.  BUT, without spiders in our world, we would be over-run with insects so they&#39;re important, but why do we have to have deadly ones?!  Same reason we have snakes, I guess, so we won&#39;t be over-run with rodents!  Most dangerous animals leave you alone if you leave them alone!  It&#39;s just part of life (or death!).", "comment_date": "2021-01-22T03:43:29Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "botcrack", "comment_text": "how do I get my hands on these spiders?...asking for a friend. <br>* watches part of video about grape jelly *<br>...hmm never mind...my friend doesn&#39;t like spiders", "comment_date": "2021-01-21T19:15:38Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Grady Morris", "comment_text": "good Video, I hate spiders too!", "comment_date": "2021-01-21T08:38:21Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "the boss", "comment_text": "Why have we not killed those spiders off yet?

The simple fact that the majority of your viewers will in all likelihood never encounter one of those spiders should be enough to not waste time on traveling to the rainforest and/or waste video time showing us the spider. Those few minutes could have been spent giving us more or better information on the topic. I find this to be a rather frequent occurrence in your videos.

Twice that distance. So I killed hundreds of these. With my hands. The &quot;shower&quot; was fenced with plastic sheet, so there wasn&#39;t really a way to hit them with a shoe or something. Spraying them wad out of the picture because a) if they survive they become aggressive (mad) and b) when you have to kill several spiders per day, it ends up getting pricey. So I started this thing of capturing them with my hand, and quickly crushing them in a one swift motion. They didn&#39;t have time to react. The only protection I would use was a plastic bag in my hand, just to keep the crushed spider&#39;s juices from my hand.<br>I look back at that now, all these years after, and specially knowing this now, I realise it was waaaaaaaaaay more dangerous than what I thought it was.", "comment_date": "2017-10-27T07:04:55Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Andrey", "comment_text": "gets bit by this spider,then gets to the part where the scapel is the only option - &quot;K, guess I&#39;ll just die then&quot;", "comment_date": "2017-10-26T17:41:05Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Matt Supertramp", "comment_text": "You think they used these spiders for ED before Viagra?", "comment_date": "2017-10-26T07:11:01Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Matt Supertramp", "comment_text": "<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JN0VtHez9xI&amp;t=7m39s\">7:39</a> I lost it", "comment_date": "2017-10-26T07:06:38Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Revelations Riedel", "comment_text": "I think seppuku sounds less painful than priapism :(", "comment_date": "2017-10-26T03:18:33Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "DSL Cheetah", "comment_text": "I just gaged", "comment_date": "2017-10-25T21:47:14Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "- Natsukashii", "comment_text": "but how does Viagra work then? interesting.", "comment_date": "2017-10-25T21:24:20Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Pangwen", "comment_text": "<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JN0VtHez9xI&amp;t=0m00s\">0:00</a> Ok, then age resrict it", "comment_date": "2017-10-25T18:04:25Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Augis R", "comment_text": "Thats right", "comment_date": "2017-10-25T01:52:32Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Israel Aguasanta", "comment_text": "Painful to watch LOL", "comment_date": "2017-10-25T00:01:30Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Inky", "comment_text": "Guys, widowmaker.

I was a paramedic when I was a younger man, I do recall being called to such an event it was a middle aged colored guy in London at the Ealing hospital , and we had to transfer him to another Hospital as the doctors in the first hospital had failed after 7 hours to reduce his erection, what I remember most of all was how huge his penis was I mean bloated,and waxen glazed, it looked about to explode its color was \u00a0so sore looking and the agony that he was in was horrendous to listen too., We were based in Hanwell west london. \u00a0We were required to transfer the patient byroad journey and \u00a0travel on the blue lights emergency system through out the journey of 14 miles approximately not at speed but as slowly as we could muster without stalling the engine litterally at walking speed avoiding each and every road obstacle bumps, potholes etc... we actually straddled each side of the road zig zagging \u00a0with 2 Police escorts \u00a0ahead and behind us on motorcycles, so next time you see an Ambulance with all their emergency lights ablaze yet going very very slowly and zig zagging all over the place remember that not all emergencies require a fast response, just a careful plotted route,.<br>AS the guy was screaming in agony with each little bump, so painful was it and sensitive to even the touch of a light sheet, which he could not bare, that he was naked on the gurnie, he could not allow anything to touch him not even a cotton sheet AS much of our attempts to avoid the obstacles were in vain he screamed for the entire journey and the tears from his eyes were streaming down so great was his discomfort. I have no idea of the outcome after we set him down at the receiving Hospital. It sure was an eyepopener for me,that I will never forget and \u00a0I do not think there was one of these spiders within 8 thousand miles approx so beware guys it can happen without a spider being anywhere near too. \u00a0So my question is how dangerous can Viagra be .? could this happen because of viagra use, Note WAY back then Viagra did not exist \u00a0not even as a twinkle in anyones eye.David.", "comment_date": "2014-01-19T01:14:12Z", "likes_count": 16}, {"comment_by": "TheKirger", "comment_text": ";~;", "comment_date": "2014-01-18T23:24:35Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Seraphim", "comment_text": "You ain&#39;t catching me in no damn rain forest", "comment_date": "2014-01-18T18:16:40Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Phil Porter", "comment_text": "Please Doc, can you take the pain away but leave the swelling.", "comment_date": "2014-01-18T11:02:25Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "JunZ Joseph", "comment_text": "Oh Heill NO", "comment_date": "2014-01-18T07:07:11Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Darwin Roberson", "comment_text": "great, i felt a spider crawling on me after this video", "comment_date": "2014-01-18T06:18:39Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "SonicLeScout", "comment_text": "this is a big cup filled with nopes", "comment_date": "2014-01-18T04:33:31Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Sir LighT the Munificent", "comment_text": "I don&#39;t know what I expected to see when I clicked on this video...", "comment_date": "2014-01-17T19:50:46Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "danielxmiller", "comment_text": "I still didn&#39;t get how causing the blood to do that benefits the spider?
