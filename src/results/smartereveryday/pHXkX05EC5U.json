But if stress persists for an extended period of time, the meat becomes dark, soft, mushy and sticky (called dark cutters), like bruised meat, and will have a very limited shelf life. The persistent high acidity in the meat caused by long-term  stress will actually begin breaking down the meat over time, almost as if the body is digesting itself. And it is also hard on the animals vital organs like the liver and kidney, which have to process these fairly aggressive chemicals and expel the waste products.
