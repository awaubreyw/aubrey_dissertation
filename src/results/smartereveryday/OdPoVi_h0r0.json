You said that your network traffic &quot;is encrypted and protected all the way to the host you&#39;re trying to contact.&quot; This is not true. The tunnel that NordVPN makes for you goes all the way to a NordVPN exit node. When you are accessing e.g. your bank account, you are basically letting NordVPN connect to your banks website for you and relaying the data that is being transfered to your computer. So if you send data to your bank, you instead send it via the tunnel to NordVPN and they in turn send it over the regular internet to your bank. This means you&#39;re basically giving your sensitive data to NordVPN and trust them to not do anything else with it than getting it to where you want it to end up.<br><br>If you want to get deeper into this, feel free to contact me, twitter@Phrewfuf.

SRB&#39;s are not as efficient so you need more fuel to get the extra fuel into orbit, and you need more fuel for that more fuel. the cost of making a SRB is pennies compared to making a liquid rocket engine so there are cases like this where it costs less in fuel lifting the in-efficinet engine than it would have to make the liquid engine. if they needed a higher delta v they would have used a liquid engine.", "comment_date": "2018-09-03T05:54:20Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Magnus Dagbro", "comment_text": "That hat is fantastic.", "comment_date": "2018-09-03T05:53:22Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "\u0250\u026f\u0279\u0250\u029e \u0250\u0131u\u0250\u026f", "comment_text": "&quot;I&#39;ll try to be veeeery professional&quot;,<br>less than a min. we hear your laugh after your hard hat talk\ud83e\udd23", "comment_date": "2018-09-03T05:53:08Z", "likes_count": 22}, {"comment_by": "Diana C", "comment_text": "Relationship goals \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80", "comment_date": "2018-09-03T05:51:17Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Dinaric Wolf", "comment_text": "They&#39;re launching it in the sun?
