The second event utilizing chamber-central initiation saw a pressure rise roughly twice that of chamber-rear initiation. What would be interesting to know would be the velocity outcome of the potato upon barrel exit! With chamber-central initiation, it appeared to have a greater ending velocity due to greater impulse occurring sooner. What was the velocity difference between the shots?

The way im thinking of this cannon is the flames act as a plunger compressing the air fuel mixture that cannot combust due to being too rich or too lean so the more of that mixture you can put between the plunger and what it is pressing against the more compression and force you will get acted on the potato so if you move the plunger forward there is less to compress therfore less force is imparted on the potato. It you break it down into known concepts its much easier to understand what is going on. Its not the flames that are launching the potato its the pressure increase those flames produce on the excess air that propels the object forward.

The middle ignition still the flammable gasses escape with the potato.

To me it makes sense to ignite from the front because then the ignition has to go from front to back and full burn all the fuel. But still not sure. Testing is the only way. Plus also I saw to cover the muzzle first. Maybe just put the potato on the end. Then Put in your fuel into the combustion chamber. Then compress the fuel by pushing the potato into the muzzle. So maybe doing these two things is the best method.", "comment_date": "2020-08-18T20:30:47Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Happy Fox", "comment_text": "Well, this is explained in the barking dog effect, with the sound that makes it&#39;s because the pressure is too high and is pushing against the ignition point.", "comment_date": "2020-08-16T09:19:07Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Mary Lagua", "comment_text": "Exciting to watch Destin!", "comment_date": "2020-08-15T22:54:28Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "PYORE", "comment_text": "Destin is a fine example of a human who hasn&#39;t ruined his brain with stress, trauma, or drugs.", "comment_date": "2020-08-12T01:51:32Z", "likes_count": 2}, {"comment_by": "M Talha Khalid", "comment_text": "So cool you did this in slomo it look like a scyfy reactor", "comment_date": "2020-08-07T16:30:58Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Ralph Guppy", "comment_text": "Lighting from the rear will also cause pressure piling towards the front of the canon.

But video after the <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TNSUIsjdpY&amp;t=5m10s\">5:10</a> is telling a completely different story, your Flame cells indicate that the flame is in lean side not in rich side, your claim is possible only when the fuel air mixture is in the lean side (Jelly jar combustor). In my observation I find that as the flame front approaches the closed end of the chamber the in front of it is compressed as the burnt gases try to expand, as the pressure builds up the flame speed decreases ans it apears to slow down not quench. As the projectile starts to move in the barrel that leads to volume expansion which in turn allows the compressed air at the end to push flame front. when the pressure in the barrel drops sufficiently low enough the flame front reignites the remaining gas mixture in the chamber. However we can still see that there is an oscillation of gases in the chamber and the barrel once the potato has exited, this is purely due to the acoustics of the duct (pressure wave).", "comment_date": "2020-04-19T15:26:47Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "M I Zulkifli D", "comment_text": "Fyi: that a toy for kids at indonesia:v", "comment_date": "2020-04-17T16:27:35Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Roger Burner", "comment_text": "So what would happen or could you even do it if you loaded the potato in the end just to make the seal, add your propellant and close off the end and then push the potato down the tube more to compress everything???

A spray of about 2 seconds should be sufficient to create a more powerful combustion. If you flood the chamber with too much fuel it reduces the amount of oxygen that can also be present which lowers the power of the explosion significantly. Try with a 1 second spray. Then 2 second spray, then keep increasing it until you get a power loss. That&#39;s the best way to &quot;tune&quot; it, similar to tuning a car&#39;s engine fuel delivery system on a dyno, except on the dyno you start overly rich, then lean it out gradually with each successive dyno run. Also, try an aerosol can of engine starter fluid instead of hair spray, or put gasoline or alcohol or E85 into an aerosol can or other spray gun to atomize it and test which burns slower/faster and determine which is best for your chamber/barrel length...not that I&#39;ve tried any of this yet ;)", "comment_date": "2019-06-18T06:37:01Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Jeff Vader", "comment_text": "<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TNSUIsjdpY&amp;t=7m34s\">7:34</a> When you get too close to the mic.", "comment_date": "2019-06-17T18:45:49Z", "likes_count": 74}, {"comment_by": "Brayden Cooper", "comment_text": "At fist I didn&#39;t see the thumbnail and I thought he was talking about pop-its", "comment_date": "2019-06-16T05:24:10Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "x Daniel", "comment_text": "How do you make that?", "comment_date": "2019-06-15T23:14:49Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "peter sgouros", "comment_text": "so what would happen if you put a one way breech valve in?", "comment_date": "2019-06-15T20:42:28Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Green Green", "comment_text": "<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TNSUIsjdpY&amp;t=7m45s\">7:45</a><br>oh look<br>a nuke", "comment_date": "2019-06-15T15:24:00Z", "likes_count": 4}, {"comment_by": "dlevy92", "comment_text": "What happens with multiple sparks?

This ring would have a small seal on the top part towards the barrel exit covering one or two small air holes. When the system pulls in oxygen instead of it going around the potato or through other crevices , it pulls the ring back giving it small burst of rich oxygen, and then when it combust outwards through the barrel it seals back forcing all the gas back out through the barrel. Its probablly a bad idea and breaks alot of laws as far as combustion science goes, but maybe someone could tell me if it wouod increase or decrease effeciency.", "comment_date": "2019-05-26T16:20:43Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "MrTraxxas4life", "comment_text": "That\u2019s the most amazing slow motion footage I think I\u2019ve ever seen \ud83d\ude33", "comment_date": "2019-05-26T06:48:17Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Michael Andersen", "comment_text": "You are mildly cracy and I love it :D", "comment_date": "2019-05-25T18:39:52Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "cody collins", "comment_text": "Wouldn&#39;t you lose power because the gas is igniting in the opposite direction to you projectile direction", "comment_date": "2019-05-25T15:38:03Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Kevin Peterson", "comment_text": "The recoil, watch his arms at <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TNSUIsjdpY&amp;t=4m00s\">4:00</a> air or oxygen rushing back in the chamber?", "comment_date": "2019-05-25T03:26:14Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "The Loopybacka", "comment_text": "I know this is old but what would happen if you lit both the middle and the back at the same time?", "comment_date": "2019-05-24T07:31:16Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "International Rocket Launches", "comment_text": "<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TNSUIsjdpY&amp;t=0m53s\">0:53</a> <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TNSUIsjdpY&amp;t=1m50s\">1:50</a> <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TNSUIsjdpY&amp;t=3m19s\">3:19</a> <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TNSUIsjdpY&amp;t=7m35s\">7:35</a> <b>Destinlaughinglikeamaniac.mp4 is not responding - Do you wish to close the program?</b>", "comment_date": "2019-05-23T10:21:36Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "R Oe", "comment_text": "<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TNSUIsjdpY&amp;t=0m55s\">0:55</a> laugh from the devil himself", "comment_date": "2019-05-23T03:32:02Z", "likes_count": 3}, {"comment_by": "F.D.

There is something I expected to see in at least one or two of them, but I never did.  Quick disclaimer: I&#39;ve never made a potato gun myself.  Maybe my understanding is wrong, but I always thought that the correct way to load/shoot a potato gun was to spray the combustion fuel into the chamber before plunging the potato.  The potato goes on the end of the barrel creating a seal, the combustion chamber is opened and the fuel sprayed in, finally, the potato is plunged down the end of the barrel before firing.  This last step allows the fuel-air mixture to become compressed as the potato, loaded earlier, created a seal and then was pushed down the barrel like the piston of an air-compressor but with an exceptionally long stroke length.  The final result should be a greater explosion. Could you possibly answer this question in one of your videos, or even do an experiment in which this method is tested?<br>Thanks,", "comment_date": "2019-02-12T07:02:45Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Tim Witkowski", "comment_text": "What type of fuel is it?", "comment_date": "2019-02-11T02:37:50Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Abe Coulter", "comment_text": "5.00 looks like a slow mo nuclear explosion", "comment_date": "2019-02-09T11:31:11Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Sinister Ferb", "comment_text": "I wonder if it sounds like a gun shot", "comment_date": "2019-02-07T17:26:00Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Mike Lowry", "comment_text": "I love that neighbor.", "comment_date": "2019-02-07T00:50:47Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Acid Stryker", "comment_text": "Flipping Awsome footage!!!

Like Dustin said, &quot;There&#39;s multiple PhD dissertations in a potato gun.&quot;  Built one for my high schooler to teach concept of stoichiometry and soon learned that I was also teaching pressure-volume-temperature lessons. We started with hair spray, but that didn&#39;t really teach the concepts, so we moved to propane as fuel.  We built a &quot;metering device&quot; to deliver just the right amount of propane (4% in air, or 20% in pure oxygen) for our 4&quot; x 48&quot; PVC combustion chamber.  We also added a brushless 12v computer fan to mix the propane/air mixture prior to ignition.  To standardize our potato weights and shape, we cut them all 5&quot; long and &quot;cored&quot; them into our 1-1/2&quot; x 60&quot; PVC barrel.  Our original design used only one BBQ ignitor spark centered in the combustion chamber.  Inclined at 45 degrees, our potatoes averaged 138 yards.  Hypothesizing more sparks, means more burning wave fronts, faster pressure build up, and further distance, we increased the number to 2, 3, 4, 5 sparks evenly spaced w/in our 48&quot; long combustion chamber.  We averaged 157 yards w/ 2 spark points, 174 yards with 3 sparks, 180 yards with 4 sparks, and no further improvement with 5 sparks.  Finally we purchased a rifled 1-1/2&quot; x 60&quot; PVC barrel online.  That added nearly 100 yards to our distances!!!  We averaged 266 yards with 4% propane/air, 4 spark points, and rifled barrel.  Needless to say: Hearing protection is a must!  Too scared to try 20% propane + pure oxygen in a PVC combustion chamber.", "comment_date": "2017-09-26T04:20:28Z", "likes_count": 100}, {"comment_by": "Deathreus", "comment_text": "The sound it made made me giggle like a child", "comment_date": "2017-09-25T22:13:48Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "EvulDali", "comment_text": "You totally need to put 5x more fuel in there and use pure oxygen instead of just air :D", "comment_date": "2017-09-25T17:07:35Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Stephen Smith", "comment_text": "I wonder how nitrous would work??? :P A little squirt of this, a little squirt of that..........", "comment_date": "2017-09-25T14:24:45Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Salty Steel", "comment_text": "I&#39;ve always made my potato cannons the same way but I have my ignition points about 2 or 3 inches from the barrel side of the combustion chamber.

That being said, I am curious as to why it actually matters where you start combustion from in regards to running out of oxidizer? Like, whatever fuel it is you&#39;re using there will burn at some ratio to Oxygen and, whatever that is, a given molecule of your fuel when burned will not react with any more oxygen than it takes to. So, if you&#39;re burning it from ANYWHERE in the chamber and it runs out of oxidizer, the only way to get more is then for it to come in again through the barrel as you showed.

But, since an higher pressure would push the potato along the barrel, maybe it would be better if you just put a low-pressure valve in the backside of the combustion chamber. You can try with a sphygmomanometer valve (that thing used to measure blood pressure), which is located in the hand-pump. It works at low pressures. Obviuosly it&#39;ll not work while the combustion is spreading, but near the end the combustion should suck the needed air from the valve instead of the barrel, resulting in a better after-combustion thrust. Not sure about this tho, since the barrel have a lower friction then any type of valve.

With the center light case where the fuel is still in there to burn on the rebound, you can see it clearly, but from the end ignite, the fuel gets shot out with the potato and either doesn&#39;t burn or burns outside the muzzle. You can see the center ignite fills the ignition chamber (as much as it does) in about 40ms vs about 70ms, too, so even if it does burn less well, it reaches max pressure sooner, and applies high pressure for a greater distance of potato travel, so it might impart more energy to the potato. Time to measure the outcome: potato distance (probably want some sort of &quot;tracer potato&quot; for that), or a momentum test (shoot it into a bucket with a relatively small hole so all the chunks stay in, with the bucket hanging from some kind of swing, measure how high the swing reaches when impacted by the potato)", "comment_date": "2017-02-03T17:29:35Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Rose is red", "comment_text": "Where is your slow motion laughter", "comment_date": "2017-02-03T15:06:23Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Connor McGuire", "comment_text": "man, some dudes get to have all the fun!", "comment_date": "2017-02-03T14:26:27Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Y JJ", "comment_text": "how can I never have done this since I am in a combustion research lab. definitely on my list now.", "comment_date": "2017-02-03T14:19:09Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Pytoz\u26a1Beatz", "comment_text": "looks awsome", "comment_date": "2017-02-03T12:37:22Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "JiShi\u00e9 DanMonSlibar", "comment_text": "Vraiment passionant.

We both got suspended and could not compete because our presentation used the word &quot;gun&quot; lol. <br><br>Btw, piezoelectric middle-mounted wood screws with aquanet hairspray worked best.", "comment_date": "2016-12-04T04:59:29Z", "likes_count": 27}, {"comment_by": "daniel yard", "comment_text": "wut tipe of fiwil", "comment_date": "2016-12-04T03:16:13Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "MAKEINZ", "comment_text": "Your slo-mo videos are so therapeutics haha", "comment_date": "2016-12-04T02:04:09Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Mindhacker", "comment_text": "i hope you know there are formulas for what you&#39;re describing they use them to design exhaust for 2 stroke engines if you make a combustion chamber from a shape like 2 cones put together with the 2 small ends facing out and close 1 and put the barrel on the other it works much better. but you have to try different cone size for optimal result", "comment_date": "2016-12-04T01:32:36Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "spb", "comment_text": "isn&#39;t there something irresponsible about indiscriminately lobbing high velocity potatoes through the air?", "comment_date": "2016-12-04T00:46:04Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Deet", "comment_text": "that first shot still hasn&#39;t come down...", "comment_date": "2016-12-04T00:43:01Z", "likes_count": 5}, {"comment_by": "Ivan Cornejo", "comment_text": "Great the works of the Lord: they are proud of all who delight in them", "comment_date": "2016-12-04T00:11:20Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Ivan Cornejo", "comment_text": "Man I wish you were my dad , I bet your kids love all these little experiment", "comment_date": "2016-12-04T00:02:58Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Tim Tompkins", "comment_text": "I&#39;m glad you have so many likes and views...and I&#39;m sure subscribers but I didn&#39;t check.<br>you seem to have fun and really enjoy doing these.  that alone makes these fun to watch.<br><br>seriously kudos to you dude", "comment_date": "2016-12-03T23:37:39Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "TheTwoDemon gaming", "comment_text": "It sounds like some spirit sound", "comment_date": "2016-12-03T23:31:19Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Colton Holiday", "comment_text": "Destin. nitrous. just saying. air is always the limiting factor in combustion potato cannons right? nitrous. makes a huge difference. my friend has a huge cannon and it was never very stout (presumably because it was in fact too big to be volumetrically efficient), one day I realized we had a full 40lb bottle and viola. problem solved. doesn&#39;t take much to make a BIG difference though.", "comment_date": "2016-12-03T23:27:05Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "MadMike 83", "comment_text": "lol looks kinda like a plasma cannon", "comment_date": "2016-12-03T23:04:48Z", "likes_count": 5}, {"comment_by": "The Virtual Scotsman", "comment_text": "If you look at the video the potato seems to slow down near the end of the barrel consistently.

From the point of ignition to the projectile leaving the barrel takes about 13 seconds of high speed footage when ignited from the end, and about 10 when ignited in the centre. I&#39;m not going to calculate the actual speed, but it is probable that the higher average speed through the barrel results in the higher exit speed.<br>The ideal shape for a combustion chamber is a sphere when it is ignited from the centre. This is because the flame front can propagate equally in every direction and so burn the whole charge gas as rapidly as possible. When you ignite from one end you limit how rapidly the flame front can propagate through the mixture for a given volume. One exception to this is that if you have a sufficiently long combustion chamber with sufficiently reactive mixture you could potentially accelerate the flame front to reinforce with the pressure wave and therefore detonate.

It seems obvious to me that there is still a lot of combustion happening after the potato leaves the barrel, in both cases, meaning there is a lot of energy released after it has any chance of propelling the potato, and it&#39;s not obvious at all that the center-ignition case is worse because of oxygen missing at the spots you mentioned.<br><br>I would guess that center-ignition is probably better because it burns more fuel (because it has twice the &quot;surface&quot; where combustion is happening) while the potato is still in the gun, therefore creating more pressure and shooting the potato faster and further. Your video seems to confirm this - I tried timing (using the millisecond timer you have there in the corner) the time it takes from the point where I can see the potato barely moving, to where it has just left the barrel, and I got ~47ms for the end-of-chamber-ignition shot, and ~42ms for the center-of-chamber-ignition shot - implying that the second potato received more acceleration and left the barrel at a higher speed, with about a 10% improvement. But, of course, this is just one sample each, the variation could be caused by the amount of fuel you used, the mass of the potatoes, the friction characteristics of each of the specific potatoes, etc, not to mention my inability to see when exactly each of the potatoes started moving and when they left the barrel.<br><br>I&#39;d say, if you want proper results for this experiment, to determine which type of ignition is better for the specific gun &amp; fuel combo, you&#39;re just going to have to fire a lot of shots using each method in a controlled environment - enough to have valid statistics to smooth out any possible variation in potato mass, friction &amp; amount of fuel inconsistencies; try to use the same amount of fuel every time, try to use a fair &amp; random sampling of potatoes for each of the methods, and either measure the speed of the potato after leaving the barrel, or the distance it travels (in which case, probably do it in a warehouse or something, to eliminate wind conditions). Now, those are results I would trust. Also, my fingers are still crossed for center-ignition, but you can prove me wrong by actually doing the experiment.<br><br>Yours truly,<br>Fellow concerned potato gun enthusiast", "comment_date": "2016-08-14T16:54:31Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Ed Jackson", "comment_text": "nice!!!", "comment_date": "2016-08-14T16:38:42Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Michael Miller", "comment_text": "Put a ruler on the barrel and film, so you can compare the acceleration of the projectiles.\u00a0 Shouldn&#39;t this give you more data as to how efficient the burn is?", "comment_date": "2016-08-14T16:32:00Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "RaytheonGaming \u2611", "comment_text": "Transparent Potato gun<br>Why didn&#39;t I think of doing this 20+ years ago when I was building these all the time", "comment_date": "2016-08-14T16:17:52Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Alexandre Vinet", "comment_text": "Glad Audible replace Eyebrows...", "comment_date": "2016-08-14T15:57:53Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "I Don.t", "comment_text": "I saw this: too much fuel, not enough oxygen.

Is possible for you to run some sort of colorimetric  analysis of the video feed?  I have a &quot;Colortune&quot; combustion analyser kit for small engines.  Its basically a custom spark plug that has a quartz window with a conductive electrode running through the middle to provide the spark gap just like a normal plug has, to ignite the air fuel mixture at the appointed time, during normal engine operation (2 or 4 stroke versions). It has an adjustable angle mirror that reflects the imaged colors from the detonation event to an angle one can easily observe (best viewing is done in a darkened environment). It came with a &quot;color-tune&quot; visual chart so one can identify the related combustion parameters associated with various carburetor adjustments. I could not identify by color variations within the flame front or within the main cylinder burn, a tint of the color blue.  Did I miss it or can you tell if it was present  using your own uncompressed video images?  This was a very cool experiment Destin. It would be interesting to see what kind of potato chunkin performance you might get from a gas charge delivered from a can of Faultless Spray Starch.

And also will be grat to compare gomogonized mixture(with cooler inside) with standard mixture.

When you ignite from the end, an equal or greater volume of unburned fuel air mixture is getting pushed out of the barrel. Ignition from the center allows the maximum amount of flame propagation, which translates to the most complete burn as indicated by the flame front almost catching the potato. A check of muzzle energy would probably show an advantage for center ignition. With rear ignition, as the potato velocity approaches it&#39;s maximum, the pressure difference between the breech and barrel creates a forward flow of gasses to give the appearance that the flame front has stopped advancing. The secondary ignition is probably related to the change in burn rate in response to pressure for your choice of fuel air mixture.", "comment_date": "2016-06-28T03:05:04Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "SMM", "comment_text": "I just saw the majesty of the universe in a potato gun.", "comment_date": "2016-06-28T01:47:13Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "MrGeorocks", "comment_text": "Multiple ignition points?", "comment_date": "2016-06-28T01:34:32Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Ken", "comment_text": "<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TNSUIsjdpY&amp;t=3m35s\">3:35</a> - <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TNSUIsjdpY&amp;t=3m41s\">3:41</a> this reminds me of a solar flare", "comment_date": "2016-06-28T00:26:01Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "ShiltoCrarpo", "comment_text": "One of the cool things you didn&#39;t do with your potato gun was play with the compression of the air/fuel mixture.

You&#39;re just getting a backdraft in the chamber instead of a large muzzle flash. You&#39;d need a chronograph to test it though. <br><br>Interestingly, a similar experiment has been done with actual firearms, with some blackpowder rifles using a front ignition, most famously the Dreyse needle gun and the Chassepot rifle. Burning from front to rear compressed the powder allowing for a faster and more complete burn, as well as producing less fouling as unburned powder wasn&#39;t thrown forwards down the barrel as with a conventional rear ignition.

When you light in the middle, the air has to expand both ways, one way expands (and compresses the unlit fuel) towards the potato , the other expands (and compresses the unlit fuel) against the back of the gun, basically dividing the movement because once the unlit fuel decompresses and mixes and mixes oxygen it ignites and again compresses the unused fuel and repeats the process. That&#39;s why it looks like a yo-yo of flame. Ideally, the location of the ignitor should be just forward enough that the mix ignites fully without causing backwards compression on the unspent fuel, about 9/10&#39;s the radius of the chamber if you have the back flat, or the radius if you have a rounded back, similar to a touch hole on a cannon.", "comment_date": "2016-06-23T23:31:16Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Juan Lantigua", "comment_text": "this is just great", "comment_date": "2016-06-23T23:26:19Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "TJ_Bass", "comment_text": "Bout to build me one", "comment_date": "2016-06-23T23:26:11Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "npetersen60", "comment_text": "it looks fake. it&#39;s so cool", "comment_date": "2016-06-23T23:22:29Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Thai Tastic", "comment_text": "who needs the anarchist cookbook when we got this guy&#39;s &#39;how to&#39; make weapons at home videos, cheers", "comment_date": "2016-06-23T23:22:09Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "altops", "comment_text": "what about trying dual or multi ignition????????", "comment_date": "2016-06-23T23:20:13Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "James King", "comment_text": "The best way is to test the theory.

At some point the pressure of the unignited gas will reach the pressure of the ignited gas and thus the only way for the flame front to move now is by propagation of the chemical reaction, which appears as an apparent stopping of the flame front. At the other end of the tube, the potato starts to move down the barrel, allowing the ignited gas to keep expanding. The potato does move slower than the initial speed of the gas, which is why the flame front still appears to slow down. Once the potato leaves the barrel the pressure starts to drop inside the chamber, which allows the gas to start expanding again. Finally, the air will rush in at the end because, as stated by other commenters, the momentum of the expanding gas will carry more out of the cannon causing pressure inside the tube to drop below atmospheric pressure.", "comment_date": "2016-06-23T18:30:46Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "User Name", "comment_text": "Any experimentation with firing both end and middle ignitions?

As a bit a of a spudgun enthusiast I have concerns with your electrodes through the combustion chamber.  They really should only be through a joint where you have two layers of PVC.  Same with your coleman lantern igniter, the cleanout is not pressure rated and I&#39;ve personally cracked a couple of them.  I&#39;ve been out of the game for a while but I think the bell reducer is also not pressure rated and should be a sch40 bushing reducer instead.

I have a few tips and an idea for another fun experiment for you. 1) use less fuel. That combustion chamber is huge, but my gut tells me 3 seconds of fuel spray might be too much. 2) cut your potatoes in half so they look more like bullets. This doubles your ammo while providing a flat surface at the rear for the expanding gas to push on.<br>For an experiment, I tried building potato cannons with conical combustion chambers in high school. I&#39;d love to see this replicated: three cannons with the same volume chamber, but one with the barrel coming out the wide end of the cone, one with the barrel out the narrow end, and one with a cylindrical chamber. All ignition is done at the back end. I think you&#39;ll be surprised at what happens! (hint: the chamber is very, very good at shaping the explosion. I had almost an order of magnitude between the distances achieved between the two conical chambers.)", "comment_date": "2016-06-23T14:35:03Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "borzwazie", "comment_text": "Notice the end cap ignition - during the initial ignition, you see the flame front &#39;rebound&#39; from the front of the combustion chamber.

It would be very interesting to experiment with different ignition points throughout the chamber.

I figured 2 combustion chambers of the same size would pull this off effectively.   I got the idea froma german super gun that had a barrel with multiple explosion chambers. Basically as the projectile moves down the barrel it travels past the combustion chambers. Each time it passes a combustion chamber it ignites creating more gas and more propulsion as the projectile flies down the barrel.

Here&#39;s the thing I don&#39;t understand: You&#39;re saying &quot;sometimes you run out of oxygen and have unburnt fuel&quot;... But shouldn&#39;t there be oxygen at the capped end as well? Does the explosion suck the oxygen selectively out of that volume, leaving behind only fuel, or does it push a front of unburnt fuel into that volume? Both sound a bit strange to me. Or is the effect due to the change in partial pressures of the gases? In the very first slow-motion it also looks like the explosion all of a sudden hits a wall at <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TNSUIsjdpY&amp;t=1m03s\">1:03</a> and slows down.

As a potato gun enthusiast myself (who isnt really...) I really apprecuate that clip. I thought   I would share what I&#39;ve learned building those: Using a computer fan inside the combustion  chamber creates a much better fuel mix and therefore a more powerful and reliable shot. Also, using triple or more spark along the combustion chamber creates multiple flame front which mean that the combustion will complete much quickly. This translate into a higher muzzle velocity because as you can see in your video, the potato starts to move way before the combustion process is complete, therefore wasting energy. I&#39;d really like a second video on those two factor, fuel mix and multiple front flame, and comparing muzzle velocity to see any improvement. Could also be a good I introduction to Thermodynamics.

Of course, the valves themselves reduce the cross-sectional area, and that increase in resistance will have /some/ effect in reducing the maximum pressure in the barrel. It might be the case that you just can&#39;t get enough valves in parallel for the increase in barrel pressure duration to out-weigh the reduced peak barrel pressure ... but, like I said, the video made me curious.

However in this video I feel that you are misleading your audience by calling this an explosion. what you have in your hands is a controlled burn.

As the mixture ignites there is a flame front that continues to burn from the source of ignition to the remainder of the cylinder. (also it&#39;s called a combustion engine and not an explosion engine) the only main difference here is that your cylinder is only going to build pressure until the pressure builds up enough to push the potato out of the barrel. Aside from all of that I really feel that running ads on your video as well as a sponsor (Audible) and having patreon supporters is getting too greedy for filming a transparent potato gun in slow motion. although I understand high speed cameras do cost quite a lot of money, however you&#39;ve been using one for most of your videos so either you&#39;ve purchased one quite a while ago or you go the much cheaper route and rent.

Been watching your videos for years and this is my first comment. Thanks for all the content.<br><br>If the fuel air mixture is not burned entirely from the layer around the edge of the chamber due to side wall cooling, and that is what causes the pollution and waste in combustion engines. Is it possible, and has it been experimented or developed already, to make a sort of two stage combustion engine that takes the left over unburned fuel air mixture, and burn it again? Either in a recycling type of concept in the same chamber, or perhaps in a secondary chamber designed more specifically for this left over fuel air mixture. And if so, would it be more efficient and or less polluting?<br><br>Mini Backstory: I have a electronic technologist education and have been researching, with my limited knowledge for years, ways to produce and use renewable energy. The biggest obstacle I see is the energy density for Batteries/Capacitors/Super Capacitors, compared to fuel. Which is why I don&#39;t think we can ever entirely get away from burning fuel as an energy source.

Might be interesting how the spud accelerates.<br><br>One more thing that I have built into one of my own spud guns is a brushless fan (brushless means no accidental premature firing). The fan is used to circulate the fuel and air. My hope is to help even out the mixture of gases in the chamber. The fan does not work as well with the hairspray as the fuel however due to it being sticky. To remedy this I have set up the combustion chamber to use propane.
