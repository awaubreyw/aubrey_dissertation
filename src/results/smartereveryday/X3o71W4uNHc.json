This serves to quick cool the epoxy that is in direct contact with the PR drop.  That temperature reduction alters the hardening of the epoxy in a zone where the heat has been lost to the glass.  This in turn serves to create a &quot;glove&quot; of quick cured epoxy around the drop itself.  In order to mitigate the affect, you would need to stir the hot uncured epoxy with the PR drop you are using in order to bring them into temperature equilibrium.<br><br>This would theoretically reduced the inhibiting effect of the cooled (quickly cured) epoxy glove around the PR drop itself.  It  would also allow you to have a tactile feedback from the epoxy while stirring to allow you choose a more desirable viscosity for the triggered PR drop explosion.  I surmise that this would allow for a more vibrant explosion of the PR drop within the more temperature/viscosity homogenized epoxy medium.", "comment_date": "2022-09-03T21:51:36Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Talus Xelen", "comment_text": "Surprised that a guy this smart doesn&#39;t consider face-shields or or gloves....  but he doesn&#39;t see them at work all the time like I do is my guess.

He was killed on the cross as payment for the sins of all mankind, three days later He rose from the dead. Forty days later He ascended into heaven where He sits at the right hand of the Father. He is returning very soon, but before He does, Satan, the devil, is coming to pretend to be Jesus/God. Satan is an angel, and he will have certain supernatural powers with which to try to fool everyone. He will, for example, be able to make fire come down from heaven in the sight of men. He will only be on earth a short time before the real King of Kings, Jesus Christ, God in the flesh, returns. When the real Jesus comes we will all be transformed into our spiritual bodies at the same moment. Jesus came in the flesh to offer forgiveness of sins and eternal life to anyone who believes and calls on His precious name!<br><br>if thou shalt confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus, and shalt believe in thine heart that God hath raised him from the dead, thou shalt be saved. - Romans 10:9<br><br>Now when Jesus was in Bethany, in the house of Simon the leper, There came unto him a woman having an alabaster box of very precious ointment, and poured it on his head, as he sat at meat. But when his disciples saw it, they had indignation, saying, To what purpose is this waste? For this ointment might have been sold for much, and given to the poor. When Jesus understood it, he said unto them, Why trouble ye the woman? for she hath wrought a good work upon me. For ye have the poor always with you; but me ye have not always. For in that she hath poured this ointment on my body, she did it for my burial. Verily I say unto you, Wheresoever this gospel shall be preached in the whole world, there shall also this, that this woman hath done, be told for a memorial of her. - Matthew 26:6-13<br><br>Seek ye the LORD while he may be found, call ye upon him while he is near: Let the wicked forsake his way, and the unrighteous man his thoughts: and let him return unto the LORD, and he will have mercy upon him; and to our God, for he will abundantly pardon.<br><br>To anoint your self, the sick, or a building for spiritual protection:<br>Get a small bottle of olive oil and pour off a small amount into a smaller vessel like a vial or baby food jar. Use the rest of the bottle for cooking. Ask the Lord to bless your vial of oil in Jesus name. Anoint yourself with the oil by placing a dab of oil on tip of finger and touch it to your forehead, and ask the Lord to bless you/heal you. Place a dab of oil on your finger and anoint the door posts and order all negativity and evil out of the house, and order that nothing negative or evil can enter into your home including piggybacking on a person entering, order it  to be so in the name of Jesus. Anoint all potential entrances to your home. To anoint the sick, place oil on tip of finger and touch it to the head of the sick and say a prayer of healing over them in Jesus name.

Would that cause it to shatter, would you end up with something like what I described earlier, or would it do something else entirely?<br><br>If you could manipulate stresses inside of a material very precisely, creating stress patterns like those seen in a Prince Rupert&#39;s Drop but without the &quot;weak spot&quot;, I think that might be extremely useful for next-gen armour. I&#39;m guessing that could probably be done with lasers, nanotechnology, or zero-g fabrication? Imagine lightweight (relative to comparable steel) armour made from glass or another material, using the same technique to make it virtually indestructible. The following question is - can this be done with materials other than typical glass? Might an already-super-hard ceramic like silicon carbide exhibit the same effect? If so, would it be even MORE indestructible than the glass versions?<br><br>For all I know, militaries are already doing something like this to make armour and I just guessed at some highly-classified technology... but I kinda doubt it tbh. Would definitely be interested in working on that - I think the gap between armour technology and weapons technology has been too large for too long, and I want to see an defensive paradigm other than just &quot;don&#39;t get hit&quot; become effective/dominant again. The lightning-quick and super-agile nature of modern conflict puts the defender at far too great of a disadvantage, and gives the aggressor far too much advantage for my liking. If conflict becomes a slow, grinding slugfest (excluding the nuclear nightmare - no one wants to see that) due to advances in defensive technologies, the advantage could be shifted over to the defender&#39;s side... and I think that&#39;s a good thing. Going on the attack should always be disincentivised as much as possible.<br><br>If it could work: Perhaps imagine a fighter jet or a battleship with ultrahard, ultra-tough ceramic armour like that... I mean, if it can resist gunfire at small sizes, why couldn&#39;t it be scaled up? Then your fighter jet might turn from a &quot;glass cannon&quot; into a literal glass-coated cannon that can straight-up tank just about anything coming its way, as long as it doesn&#39;t, say, get hit in the engines... also, HUGE naval ships could become militarily viable again, as the larger a ship is the smaller its surface area to volume ratio - maybe super-battleships with armour that can take incredible punishment and resist even modern weapons with relative ease, while carrying a totally unparalleled armament (gigantic missile batteries, enormous main guns for shore bombardment, maybe even next-gen weapons like giant railguns or laser-based CIWS)... also maybe personal body armour that can shatter/deflect 20mm cannon rounds all day - sure, the shock waves would probably still cause some serious issues, but I&#39;m sure there&#39;s a way that can be mitigated.<br><br>What do I know, though? I&#39;m prolly just dreaming/getting overexcited... I sincerely doubt any of that is actually possible - at least not with today&#39;s technology, or even tomorrow&#39;s. If it were, I&#39;m sure people far brighter than me would already be on it, and would likely have figured out how to do it already.", "comment_date": "2022-06-07T19:11:04Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Crazy Cat", "comment_text": "You should try finding out if it brakes because of the tighter inside part trying to fill space or expand because of the damage to the tail.

I really appreciated your work with the Prince Rupert&#39;s Drop!  It&#39;s been a puzzling mystery for centuries.  As a glass artist, it holds perhaps an extra measure of curiosity, as there&#39;s remained a desire to (like you) capture the explosion of the glass for a more permanent display.  Just a couple of observations:  Something I&#39;ve learned from working with epoxy resins - if you don&#39;t want air bubbles, don&#39;t mix any air into the liquid!  Perhaps a magnetic stirring set up could help reduce the amount of infused air?  Your glassblower friend should be able to easily create not only colored glass PRD&#39;s, but multiple colored drops.  A &quot;cane&quot; of glass can be done with a clear glass center, a red glass middle, and perhaps a thin blue outer layer - of course the color selection would be up to your choices.  But perhaps similar multi-colored glass PRD&#39;s would permit you to establish just what part of the drop was moving where.  Could the inner portions of the PRD have more or less explosive energy?  Maybe just set one off on a large sheet of white paper, and see if you can analyze the colors and distance of the fragments?  With your high speed video, you might even be able to &quot;see&quot; the dynamics of the multi-colored glass take place as it explodes?  Remember as well, that law of physics - for every action, there&#39;s an equal and opposite reaction.  At least in part that might explain the way the drop reduces back after the initial explosion.  The resin had already sorta &quot;set&quot;, so there was no flow of any resin back into the void, I do think that as you surmised, it was the air&#39;s pressure that forced the air into the void or cavity.  Since you have the vacuum set up, perhaps try repeating the explosion without any air pressure - might allow a more liquid resin to invade the cavity.  Finally, I&#39;ll offer one further idea.  Rather than immersing the PRD in <b>almost</b> solid resin, or coating the PRD with same, how about coating the PRD with something really flexible, like liquid latex (often used for complex mold making).  At least it might confine the particles a bit better, and with any luck the particles at least on the outside of the PRD could be captured for analysis (are particles all same size, or are there variations  related to position on the PRD?

Of coarse anything that moves or permeates through the Ether will cause pressure mediation, and the rush of air is also helping facilitate the expansion of the glass creating a &quot;stacking&quot; of pressure, force and motion resulting in a visible pressure wave in the epoxy.

I had a different difficulty, but my solution could potentially help you out. Unlike the glass from your Prince Rupert drops, insects float instead of sink. I didn&#39;t want the beetle to float to the top, I wanted it suspended in the middle. Instead of casting all of my resin at once and trying to put something on the beetle to keep it in place, I eventually came up with the solution of layering the resin. I made three layers. I poured the first layer, let it gel (but not harden), positioned the beetle, poured the second layer, let it gel (but not harden) and finally poured the third layer. This surrounded the beetle completely, so no legs or other body parts were exposed.<br><br>This could be used with your Prince Rupert drop in resin. You could make the first layer and let it gel, then put in your glass, get it right up to the time when it begins to gel, and then break your glass.

You now have less density inside that space. The mediem is not air this time though, its glass. A much higher viscosity, density and mass, so the movement is now at the atomic level, but with probably more force. When you fracture the back of this glass vaccume cannon, the glass is released to move forward as well, but it collides with the glass in front of it, braking it loose as well.

Furniture coating resins are intended to be used in thin layers where the heat isn&#39;t much of a factor.

One is that many resins are non-Newtonian fluids.

It may work better to do try this in a pressure chamber and release the pressure before the resin has fully cured.<br><br>Ultimately, I would look into getting away from resin and go with a gel that thickens as it cools like a high concentration of agar or a clear ballistic gel.

Of course a much easier solution would be using slower-curing epoxy which creates far less immediate heat build up which would eliminate the problem of the runaway exothermic reaction, but I was just giving my two cents to help with the epoxy you had on hand.", "comment_date": "2022-05-30T03:55:55Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Theokritus", "comment_text": "As soon as epoxy starts to smoke it flashes off QUICKLY", "comment_date": "2022-05-30T03:55:46Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Marcelo Henrique", "comment_text": "Why don&#39;t wait the resin to get complete hard?", "comment_date": "2022-05-30T03:55:41Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "ChillyWilly 0883", "comment_text": "makes me think of the wormhole jumping out of the Stargate", "comment_date": "2022-05-30T03:55:28Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "RedFathom", "comment_text": "what does the epoxy look like with polarized light?", "comment_date": "2022-05-30T03:54:13Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Evie! 25 y.o - check my vid\u00e9\u00f3", "comment_text": "I&#39;m curious if a two headed drop can be made and will it work the same", "comment_date": "2022-05-30T03:54:08Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "tiger.stripe", "comment_text": "Did you bring one of those paper weights back to the glass maker?", "comment_date": "2022-05-30T03:53:42Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Robert Lewis", "comment_text": "Stop bullying Prince Rupert<br>Otherwise, disgustingly wholesome.", "comment_date": "2022-05-30T03:52:56Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "MarioMadness", "comment_text": "You can get out the bubbles with a torch", "comment_date": "2022-05-30T03:51:50Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "AloysiusVo", "comment_text": "Should&#39;ve let the thing dry", "comment_date": "2022-05-30T03:51:44Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Brandon Emmanuel", "comment_text": "Starts at <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3o71W4uNHc&amp;t=7m35s\">7:35</a>", "comment_date": "2022-05-30T03:49:53Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "\u2606xXFandomNerdXx\u2606", "comment_text": "You&#39;ve had a different intro every episode.

So, selecting the correct epoxy for the job can make a world of difference. <br><br>2) the mixing method was sub-optimal for a uniform cure and the clearest result. If you\u2019re going to mix by hand, you should use a normal paint stir stick, and mix thoroughly for a minimum of 1 minute while scraping the sides of the cup, then pouring into a second container before pouring into the final mold (without scraping the sides of the second container). This will promote uniformity in the mix and curing. Which will give you the clearest epoxy, and the most uniformed cure (which makes it easier to know when to break the drop) <br><br>3) if you\u2019re going to mix with a drill, there are very inexpensive mixer attachments for your regular drill that will give a much better mix. However, using a drill to mix will always introduce more air than hand mixing, thus, will need more time in the vacuum chamber, or more passes with a torch.", "comment_date": "2022-05-30T03:08:33Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Bossman", "comment_text": "Ok sure very interesting but have you considered deep frying it, just didn\u2019t think the video was American enough", "comment_date": "2022-05-30T03:08:07Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Wapper Snappers", "comment_text": "If you mix the epoxy by hand it takes longer, but it doesn\u2019t get cloudy.

When cleaning be sure to keep the epoxy types separate. Wrap paper towels used to wipe one type in a plastic bag you can tie shut before throwing in the trash. Never wash tools used with both types in the same sink so it doesn&#39;t mix and stick to the drain or clog the plumbing. <br> Use a bowl to prevent encapsulation of unmixed epoxy in the crease, or corner, of a bucket or cup.<br>Shaking in a sealed container or stirring quickly with a wire whisk, a glass rod, or a solid blade such as a popsicle stick incorporates air bubbles into the mix. The cooking technique known as folding helps reduces incorporation of air, helping prevent the formation of bubbles. While steadily rotating a mixing bowl slowly scrape with a wide flexible silicon spatula from the rim towards the center. Without letting the spatula break the surface lift, fold, and spread the mixture to the edge. Repeat until fully incorporated. <br>Pot times increase at colder temperatures, resin cures faster in higher temps. The longer you have your mixture in a confined space, the hotter &amp; faster the exothermic reaction occurs, accelerating hardening. The greater the surface area, the easier heat disperses. Mixing in a wide shallow bowl sitting in an ice bath should delay cure times, allowing you to work longer. Lower temperatures may make components more difficult to emulsify.  Warming both components in a hot water bath before decanting, mixing in a double boiler, and working on a hot day all make mixing easier as well as decrease the time for the resin to cure.\r<br>   To ensure preferred video perspectives use rigid scaffold to arrange Rupert&#39;s Drop inside your transparent container before you mix and pour the epoxy.  With firm pressure you may experience some dampening of the vibration within the glass, but not so much that it prevents shattering. <br>The glass will most easily break at the thinnest spot of the tail. Rather than cutting or snipping use a fulcrum at the thinnest point of the tail. A long string tied to the tip of the trailing lever portion of the tail can be pulled to snap it. Avoid shattering glass compressed between your (\u00bfungloved?!) fingertips. Avoid accelerating shards of glass or molten resin entirely by standing far enough away behind a barrier. <br>The larger the containing vat you use the longer it will take for reflected pressure waves to compress the explosion, allowing the dispersion envelope to continue to expand. <br>I&#39;ve never used UV cured resin, but I think it cures very quickly. Maybe it would be a better medium to capture the kinetic path of an explosion. Perhaps with large arrays providing brighter and/or multiple frequencies of UV light it would cure nearly instantly.", "comment_date": "2022-05-30T02:01:06Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Mark_ _Whitfield", "comment_text": "I don&#39;t get this.

The right before you break the tail set off a smoke bomb in the second box. When it&#39;s full of smoke break the tail, if it&#39;s outside air causing the bubble it should suck the smoke in and turn it what ever the color of the smoke is say purple or red k think they would show up best for contrast. Im not sure if it will work.  But that&#39;s what I&#39;d try and i usually have a knack for things like this. And if it doesn&#39;t work out and doesn&#39;t  pull the smoke in from outside, then its time to consider other forces at play. I&#39;d speculate that as the prd explodes for lack of a better term atm, I&#39;d think shock from the the rapid explant of the shock wave thrj the epoxy  caused the epoxy to basically shear that point  allowing the trapped air in the remains of the prd  to flow into the sheared area and causing a change in how the epoxy sets up there. Like the sides of the shear when exposed to the air suddenly skim over so the set up as separated areas instead of setting up like the first prd did without the bubble and  allowing it to sink.  Maybe this will help you answer some of the questions you have as to what&#39;s happening with the prd and the air. Or maybe it will ask more questions than it answers. The epoxy can be considered either a viscous liquid or else is a plasticized solid. Maybe since its almost a solid I don&#39;t think it would be pyroclastic, like the lava flows in Hawaii.

Well, a vacuum is going to try and find the least resistant substance to suck in, and considering the streaks may essentially be a sandwich of the 2 part epoxy, where the &quot;bread&quot; part and the &quot;filling&quot; part touch will solidify, making an incredibly strong balloon, or &quot;chamber&quot;.

Thus, the two chambers equalise in their vacuum strengths, where the PRD is much more voluminous so seems to suck more, leaving those void &quot;streaks&quot;.<br><br>In short, PRD sucked the unmixed fluids out of the 2 part mix, as a result of the PRD self-sealing itself with resin at the top.<br><br>I&#39;d actually say that is a little more impressive than what you did, as not only did you create a snowflake, but you suspended that snowflake in transparent snowflake, then broke the snowflake into countless more snowflakes which are now suspended in snowflake, which additionally created more snowflake.", "comment_date": "2022-05-30T01:23:54Z", "likes_count": 3}, {"comment_by": "nuke nuked", "comment_text": "would so love one of them for my computer desk <br>top video mate", "comment_date": "2022-05-30T01:23:15Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Vivan Greco", "comment_text": "You might try creating a block of ballistic gelatin with the drop suspended inside.

The shock wave will be propagating along the axis of the glass and might be oscillating between the base and the cavity providing fissures for the gas within the glass to gently expand into.

Just a note on materials handling. Your insistence on using a mechanical stirrer may have spoiled the whole experiment. Those of us that mix resins every day know that hand mixing is virtually the only way to get a thorough blend of the resin and its catalyst. It is possible to see, in all your batches, visible viscosity gradients. The &quot;swirly&quot; bits represent incomplete mixture. Your mechanical mix has introduced air bubbles and does not mix resin coating the sides bottom and corners of the mixing container. When properly mixed by hand your pot of catalyzed resin will be clear and have very few air bubbles in suspension, it will gel more evenly. Improperly mixed the resin will have pockets of very hotly catalyzed resin that goes very exothermic surrounded by resin that has little or no catalyst that will polymerize only slowly or much later. Hence the splash when you broke the drops. Additionally, subjecting the incompletely mixed batches to vacuum may have released the styrene from suspension greatly accelerating polymerization in the hot portion of the resin. So, thoroughly and carefully mix till the batch is completely clear and you may not need to vacuum bubbles out and you will have resin that polymerizes evenly and completely.

You then work backwards towards the starting point by figuring out 1) what you know, 2) what you need to know &amp; 3) what you need in order to begin. Once you&#39;ve accomplished 1 thru 3 youll be ready for number 4 which is figuring out what you need to start the project. <br>What I know about Prince Rupert&#39;s drops (PRDs) prior to your 2 videos is basically nothing. However,  from HS Art class plus 50 years of life experience since I might be able to help with the next batch. The first thing I see is that a glass blowers tool is not a very good way to achieve any consistency in making the PRDs. A ladle would allow for higher temps resulting in a thinner consistency for the pour resulting in more control over the drips/drops &amp; more drops per pour. Before you go nuts making a bunch consider 3 more things, the quenching pot, the pouring height above the surface of the water, the depth of the water. You should probably be monitoring the water temp also. White hot molten glass can be poured like molten metal allowing for more consistent pours resulting in more consistent diameters and lenghts. (Mass)<br>Next is the quenching pot, consider using a fifty gallon steel drum. It should be placed as close to the furnace as is safe &amp; practical as time and temp are critical elements. With a rocket scientist on the team monitoring the temp of the molten glass should be achievable. Next would be the distance from the ladle to the surface of the water. More specifically the time over distance. You want the molten droplet to have enough time to absorb some of those awfully long tails you were getting. <br>The last part of the PRD making equation is the depth of the water. You want the new PRDs to cool sufficiently before inertia meets the immovable bottom of the pot. <br>Hopefully something here will help you create enough PRDs of approximately the same mass, quality and shape that you can figure out the issues you were having with the epoxy because I have no real clues for you. \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2642\ufe0f<br>Have a Great Memorial Day,<br>From L A \ud83d\ude4b\u200d\u2642\ufe0f (Lower Alabama \ud83d\ude01)", "comment_date": "2022-05-29T21:57:55Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Christian Salge", "comment_text": "I&#39;d be curious to see what a prince rupert&#39;s drop in slow motion being shattered with the light coming from a LASER.", "comment_date": "2022-05-29T21:57:51Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "ManMadeDesaster", "comment_text": "God would say: The Prince Ruperts Drop is not a bug, its a feature!", "comment_date": "2022-05-29T21:57:36Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Bryce", "comment_text": "Great content!

Really, quick observation, you have to make a guess, when you break something that leaves a gap, when you got a gap it becomes a staw for air come in, the fact is when something opens it open for air to come in, think as the vacuum of space if you break part the ship and the whole ship just snap in pieces like this then all the air goes out and leaving the crew dead within an instance, so point back this is same rules but apply air that is shock force because the air is being sucked into by Rupert&#39;s drop like a straw but expanding like a balloon.  It is the same principle as a burning house with a giant fireball but it is a burst for this is why you don&#39;t enter the front of the house because the house may end up like Rupert&#39;s drop reversing the flow from in and out because the shock wave is bouncing forward then back and out the exit where it came from.  Thus this explains the shock wave is created by the air thanks to Rupert&#39;s drop leaving a huge gap when it snaps like a doorway sucking the air behind it causing the flow of air running through Rupert&#39;s drop making every crack outward in every direction which we are speaking millions of tiny shards of glass causing tiny miniature air suction that slapping one another like a tornado but explosive air like bomb do sonic booming across the city but a tiny version of it, which leads to the point cause air in the poxy as the shockwave pushes out all direction where the rupert&#39;s tear is at.", "comment_date": "2022-05-29T21:49:49Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Burnt Almonds", "comment_text": "By the second one I thought that maybe what you\u2019re trying to get is like a ballistic gel type affect when at first I thought you were going for a solid resin explosion to see it all in one piece\u2026still watching", "comment_date": "2022-05-29T21:48:38Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "barry kennedy", "comment_text": "Would not like to walk in my bare feet on that lawn after this", "comment_date": "2022-05-29T21:48:17Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Matt Scanlan", "comment_text": "For better results, vacuum degas before pouring into the mold, then vacuum degas the mold.

Your drill mixed SUPER aggressively compared to how one could mix with a stir stick. This adds a lot of air and can cause problems when degassing. Also along those lines, visible streaks are a sign of insufficient mixing. We mixed our resins in i think 5 gallon buckets (maybe they were 2.5, idk) up to something like 6 Kg per bucket, and would mix for 5 minutes and degass for 12. Granted, we also had a much slower curing resin than you have here. It was also an infusion resin, meaning it had relatively low viscosity as to be able to be pulled into the part by vacuum. <br>2. When degassing, we would drop a scotch-brite pad into our resin buckets. If I recall correctly, our engineers had found the buckets bubbled over less this way. <br>3. &quot;Super magic smoke time&quot; is an issue of overheating due to resin curing being an exothermic reaction that is accelerated by heat. In any other context of resin use this is very much your enemy. Also the smoke is quite likely bad for your health. And as you discovered, the resin can easily get hot enough to burn you. To avoid this, use a slower curing resin/hardener, smaller containers, or add some other system to pull heat away from your resin faster.", "comment_date": "2022-05-29T18:52:18Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "jay duper", "comment_text": "Great experiments with amazing results and theory.

The reason that it&#39;s at the bottom/sides of the bulb rather than above the bulb is due to gravity pulling the shards that are above the bulb downwards and thus towards one another, but at the bottom of the bulb and to the sides, this is not the case and thus air can force it&#39;s way out. I think that essentially creates a one-way valve due to the shape of the shards, where the air can flow out of the bulb by squeezing through small fractures and just barely pushing the shards apart but the resin can&#39;t flow back due to it&#39;s own viscosity combined with the aforementioned shard geometry.

Would it make the drop any stronger or weaker if you used colder of warmer water?  I ask because I would imagine that the extreme temperature difference is one of the reasons this thing can exist, and I also would imagine that it would get increasingly difficult, but more worthwhile to form drops in ice cold water because these would be the strongest?  Im asking because this is how I imagine the outcome to be, I know nothing of these things but Im very interested in the science behind it all.<br><br>Not only the formation of the drop is important, but as well the formation of the epoxy resin.  You can see how time critical these things could be, and I believe that there are a wide range of ways to create this effect, from strong drops and strong epoxy to weak drops and weak resin.  As long as the goalposts stay in place, you could use the easiest way to experiment on this by using the most average forms of drops and epoxy resin.  However, this would give an average return on the size of the end result, because I believe the strongest drops would have the most force upon exploding, as well at the weakest epoxy resin allowing the explosion to get out of hand or mess up the experiment.<br><br>So with all this in mind, a strong drop would be key, as well as a thicker soupy resin for capturing the best effect.  This is of course all just hypothesis and theory.  Perhaps as well a well lit and temperature controlled work environment would help make the capture go smooth along with a holding device for the drop and a trigger device to begin the experiment without worrying about shaky hands.<br><br>This is awesome stuff and Im sitting here using youtube&#39;s slow motion to see in better detail how this stuff happens.  Maybe a magnifying glass in front of the slow mo camera or perhaps a strong macro lens for a sharper image?

Since 2016 I&#39;ve studied the subject for thousands of hours, seen thousands of videos by other brothers and sisters who have searched for and found proof of what the KJV said before.</b>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0<br><br>\u00a0 \u00a0<b>In Amos </b><b><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3o71W4uNHc&amp;t=8m11s\">8:11</a></b><b> God said that He was going to send a famine, not of food or water, but of hearing His words. In Daniel 12:4 God told Daniel to &quot;seal&quot; his book until the last days. And in Revelation 22:10 He told John </b><b><i>not</i></b><b> to seal his book because the time is at hand. &quot;Seal&quot; is defined as &quot;protect from Satan&quot; in Strongs. In Daniel 7:25 God said that the Antichrist would &quot;think to change </b><b><i>times and laws&quot;</i></b><b> (history and scripture along with laws of physics) and that God would give him the power to do so for a while. This is what the &quot;lying signs and wonders&quot; of 2nd Thessalonians 2 was talking about. As hard as it is for most Christians to believe, the proven fact is, all bibles have been </b><b><i>supernaturally</i></b><b> changed right in our homes and there are now </b><b><i>thousands</i></b><b> of scripture changes in every bible on earth!!!</b>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0<br><br>\u00a0 \u00a0 <b>God commanded us to &quot;prove all things&quot; and I have provided </b><b><i>lots</i></b><b> of undeniable proof for true followers of Jesus Christ in my playlist by typing in PROOF OF BIBLE CHANGE RESIDUE JUNKIE.</b>\u00a0 \ud83d\udc48\u00a0<br><br>\u00a0 \u00a0<b>I haven&#39;t read any bible for years but instead have continued studying scripture by simply learning what all has been changed.
