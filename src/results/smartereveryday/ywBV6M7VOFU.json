So when we were emptying a bin, the center of the beans would quickly draw down, forming a cone.  Because it didn\u2019t have that auger, the sides of the cone had to be manually knocked down to keep the process going.  Believe it or not, I recall working around the inside perimeter of those bins, with a couple of my cousins, to kick down the sides toward the center cone.  I was maybe 12 or 13.  In hind site it was definitely dangerous, but we were only doing the same things our fathers did, growing up on that farm.<br><br>All that said, the grain bin construction footage was new to me; I\u2019ve never seen one built.

Then like the other guy said, he has a good accountant, a guy who does the marketing, etc.  The biggest problem with starting out farming is MONEY, most of these larger farms are multi-generational, been in the family for generations and these guys learned a lot working on their farms before eventually taking them over.  They have been using this machinery for years and KNOW what usually goes wrong and are most often simple fixes, but when the electronics breaks or major parts break, they do have technicians/mechanics that they call to make repairs.

Why do the corrugated lines run horizontally and not vertically? I would think the corrugation would be used to hold up the weight of the roof and the pressure of the walls above each section. Like pressure in the oceans, wouldn&#39;t the pressure on the sections closest to the floor be the most extreme? The way it&#39;s built with them going horizontally, it seems like that would encourage the whole thing to crumple downward with gravity. But if the corrugated metal ran vertically it would be much stronger, much harder to crush from the top down. What am I missing here? What mechanical advantage is gained by making the corrugation run horizontally? It&#39;s not like this thing can twist. Or can it?

That auger circles around like an agitator so there is no right side it will come towards you.  You are dependent on a machine not breaking down.  The auger doesn&#39;t necessarily have to continue in the direction of the pile of grain it can hop back towards you.  In my case it moved into what you guys called the safe area more than 6 feet.<br><br><br>We had a farm with this system and the auger had hopped over the grain.  I went in the bin with the auger.   Shoveled the grain over into the auger.  My thinking was that with my foot securely on the end the auger bearing so things would be good.  Then the auger moved counter clockwise backing away from me.  I was lucky enough to notice and use my shovel as a wedge under it to stop it when it changed directions again moving clockwise.  So there is no emergency stop inside the bin for that auger because manufactures believe you will never enter the bin with that thing running.

Looked like it was planted a little thick or some doubles (two or more seeds planted close together) neither is good for corn, because it&#39;s a very population-sensitive crop (other corn plants too close tend to &quot;cannibalize&quot; nutrients from each other, no neither makes a good ear).  I trust you&#39;re planting a good sweet corn variety here for ear corn.  Looks like you could use some nitrogen fertilizer as well to supplement the soil; corn likes plenty of nitrogen and phosphate (phosphorus) and a bit of sulfur never hurts either (usually).  Water was definitely the limiting factor, when the leaves roll up it&#39;s already hurting for water pretty bad.  If it had enough water the leaves wouldn&#39;t roll up like that and the color would tell you a lot about the plant&#39;s health and nutrient needs-- usually if it&#39;s a light green or yellowish is a sure sign it needs more nitrogen.  IF it&#39;s dark green it&#39;ll be healthy and have all the nutrients it needs to make a good crop.  If you have too many plants or plant seeds too thick (overpopulation) you can always thin it out by pulling up some of the plants so they&#39;re no closer than about 6-8 inches apart.  In dry conditions or poor soil nutrient availability, planting no closer than about 12 inches apart (or more) will allow each plant more soil to obtain nutrients and water to make a crop, but of course the lower population means less plants to produce ears, so it&#39;s a tradeoff... that&#39;s why farmers in different areas with different climates, weather patterns, heat or high temps in summer, thinner soils, sandier soils (which hold less water for shorter periods of time before drying out) plant different populations (seeds per acre or unit of area).  <br>Best of luck on your corn for next year!

It also had an auger that optionally went up the center of the pivot to cycle grain from the bottom to the top of the bin. I also worked for a company in the summer of &#39;79 that sold not just bins but whole grain systems that weren&#39;t covered in this video. These grain &#39;legs&#39; are the big Christmas tree shaped structures that hover above a set of bins. I helped with everything from the concrete work for the swimming pool type of dump pits at the base of the leg and bin slabs, to the steel work and leg down chute branches... Very interesting and dangerous job but my monkey climbing years are behind me now.

But the corn.. it would go from the grain truck or gravity boxes, and it would go into a dryer which would dry it first, and then from there it would be augered into the bins! we also had these devices which we would collect a small sample from a spout that we would push in and it would spit out the sample into the cup, and we would slowly pour it into the reader which would tell us if it was dry enough or not. My mom&#39;s cousin was also a grain trucker.. I rode with him many MANY times in my teen years! The truck loading, the auger at the bottom of the bin.. it&#39;s all VERY familiar with me!

If you were impressed by the dryer fan on that bin, your next stop should be industrial dust collection in industries like woodworking. Find yourself a manufacturer of coffins (yes, the final resting place kind), see how they produce the milled boards on 12 axle milling machines and how important dust and chip removal is to their productivity and their safety. The fan you saw there was an average fan in a crappy housing. Find a company that sells and installs central dust collection systems and ask them to show you a working system. You&#39;ll see fans that will easily eat you up. Interesting bonus facts to put in that video, would be channel collapse (when the vacuum gets too high due to sudden inlet blockage, a vacuum shock can dent the first tube and if the vacuum is not shut off, the tube will collapse, causing a domino effect collapsing the entire channel), dust explosions and safety measures (controlled explosion directing), transport fans (fans that pass the chips through the blades get a serious beating on the inside of their housing, and will eventually wear and rip no matter how durable the steel and how soft the wood). I used to be a design engineer for such systems, and what looks like just some tubes and a collection bin, is in fact a balanced system of fans, sensors, a lot of calculations (nozzle shapes and sizes, duct sizes, splits and branches, filtering surface, combustibility, etc).

I&#39;ve made my career around agriculture for the last 30 years and farmers are some of the best people on the planet and some of the smartest and most humble. This really hits home on a year like we are having where in my area we have almost nothing planted and a majority of my customers will not have any crops to harvest. To give you an idea, my boss and I were talking about the current planting season which normally would be long over by now. There are currently 31 million acres un-planted in the US farm belt. Doing a little math I told my boss &quot;OK, 31 million acres, divide that by 640 (acres in a sq mile) take the sq root of that and you have a square 220 miles by 220 miles with nothing in the ground&quot; ~ just this afternoon talking with one of our good customers he planted 30 acres of corn on sandy gravel back in April- he won&#39;t turn another wheel this season.  - As for those grain bins, they are one of the most dangerous things on a farm or at an elevator. In my time in my location I can recall at least 3 people who have died being trapped in bins - It is a complete and absolute sin to climb into a bin where the grain has bridged up- It is worse than quicksand. Nice topic! I couldn&#39;t figure out how you were going to do 15 minutes on grain bins but you hit it all man, great job! A TON of information packed in there on such a mundane topic, but you always make it so interesting- Pretty good for a science nerd my man!", "comment_date": "2019-06-20T23:24:05Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "JD Faulk", "comment_text": "Great video", "comment_date": "2019-06-20T23:13:53Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Dux Bellorum", "comment_text": "fascinating, I wonder if you could swim in the grain with the fan on -- like the compressed-air quicksand hot-tub from Mark Rober.", "comment_date": "2019-06-20T23:11:40Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Rex Klint", "comment_text": "Well, maybe they&#39;re not the &quot;smartest&quot; in any one field, but they&#39;re kind of a jack of all trades.

Half of their 13 brothers (both families combined) are still farmers. My dad worked the fields from 8 to 25 and my mom moved to the city for college since she was 22.<br>When I was 13, my father bought a patch of land because he was afraid he was going to lose his job as a policeman for a crime he didn&#39;t commit (Long story short, a fellow policeman of my father was shot and killed, the murderer&#39;s son was tortured by a handful of policemen, cried a river on the media and the command decided to criminally indict every single cop in the nearby region. It&#39;s military law, crimes commited by policemen are seen as a smear on the institution, so it&#39;s far harsher than civilian law. Presumption of innocence doesn&#39;t exist in it), so he decided to grow wathever he could. And employed the whole family to do it. Mostly me.<br><br>It was hard work. I hated every single second of it, except when I got to drive the tractor. The land was so small we barely employed mechanization, just the occasional time dad rented a tractor to till the land and move produce. We farmed &quot;organic&quot;, without using pesticides or defensives. About 40% of our crops were lost to crop diseases, but thankfully the &quot;organic&quot; fad was spooling up, so we sold our stuff at a premium. We still barely made a profit.<br><br>As I grew up, my dad was cleared of charges against him and I started my apprenticeship at 17, moving out to college at 18. Eventually, I started to put great value on my short farming experience and started seeing things differently. I&#39;ll always be a city boy, but I see how city people takes things for granted. They often think growing stuff is just throwing seeds in the ground. No. Farming is complicated. You have to at the very least take into account weather, season, soil conditions and what you can and cannot grow. You simply can&#39;t grow cocoa beans in temperate climates, just as a starter. If you have a land with a gradient mild enough to allow mechanization, you will have to know how to fix those machines, because you can&#39;t call a repairman in the middle of nowhere or tow a harvester from the middle of a field (well, sometimes you just have to do it. Even at the cost of trampling some crop). Then there&#39;s all the complexity of seeds and storing produce. Most seed nowadays were the results of crossbreeds that make them sterile once they give fruit. So you can&#39;t just store a portion of the harvest to use as seeds.<br><br>Massive respect for farmers.

You also need the schematics  of the machine to be able to do a repair or to calibrate things correctly. Even then experience is everything, because decades after buying a harvester, the company may still hasn&#39;t corrected the errors in their maintenance and repair documents.

We collected about 5,000 gallons of milk from surrounding farms and this was processed into about 40 x 70lb cheese wheels with no additives apart from some salt and the rennet to kick start the process.<br>Farming is hard work and I feel quite sorry for  the many small independent farmers because they really have no time for holidays or breaks because there is always something to be done from feeding the animals to general maintenance around the place.<br>Yet few farms (if any) around where I live ( south-west England) grow food any more and even fewer farms produce milk. I even returned to the cheese making farm where I had worked about 35 years before.<br>The farm still makes cheese but it&#39;s now wrapped in plastic and tastes horrible, in fact, it&#39;s an insult to call it cheese.<br>Most if not all the farms around my region mainly grow: Oils seed rape, crops for the biodigester like maize, wheat and turnips or elephant grass for the animal bedding industry, farms are run by 3 or 4 people and seem to be owned by corporations or conglomerates. <br>The county council owns many of the farms and have been selling them off to bigger farming enterprises and booting out the tenant farmers because they no longer give them a big enough return and two of the farmers I know personally and they had been growing organic produce which takes many years to get going and the food is worth it&#39;s weight in gold unlike most commercial food and meat which isn&#39;t.<br>The problem is subsidies, yet why should farmers get subsidised for doing their jobs? I don&#39;t in my capacity as a conservation builder where I try to use sustainable materials like wood and hair (for fibres) or wool for insulation.<br>Many farms could not exist without subsidies yet if my business did not make a profit (and mine does not, it just about covers my bills) I would be on benefits or out on the street.<br>The other huge problem is the heavy machinery and the chemicals and fertilisers needed to run the farm and make things grow and if your farm uses GMO&#39;s then heaven help the land because these are of no benefit whatsoever to the microorganisms and worms needed to make the soil healthy and without these the food has little (if any) nutritional value and by using products like RoundUp they have even less, especially the livestock fed on it.<br>There is too much food waste because of sell-by dates and supermarkets demanding blemish free fruit and veg or straight cucumbers etc.<br>By continuing as we are with farming practices the land will be almost unusable within 50 to 60 years and we only have ourselves and the supermarkets and corporations to blame along with the governments for failing to do anything except to help worsen the situation.<br>Time to change, time to RE-WILD all the farms.", "comment_date": "2019-06-15T05:41:11Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "James Blake", "comment_text": "Nice Job!

Months later, we were spending hours in the game, just tending to our crops. The math, logistics, economics, business, mechanical engineering, etc. that the game required blew my mind. I thought &quot;Farming? How hard can it be? Farmers are dumb. I&#39;m smart. This will be easy.&quot; Boy, was I wrong.  It may have just been a game, but it gave me a new respect for farmers after seeing what went into their daily lives and how it all worked.

Reviews have been published by individuals who are consultants and employees of companies commercializing glyphosate-based herbicides in support of glyphosate\u2019s reapproval by regulatory agencies. These authors conclude that glyphosate is safe at levels below regulatory permissible limits. In contrast, reviews conducted by academic scientists independent of industry report toxic effects below regulatory limits, as well as shortcomings of the current regulatory evaluation of risks associated with glyphosate exposures. Two authors in particular (Samsel and Seneff) have published a series of commentaries proposing that long-term exposure to glyphosate is responsible for many chronic diseases (including cancers, diabetes, neuropathies, obesity, asthma, infections, osteoporosis, infertility, and birth defects). The aim of this review is to examine the evidential basis for these claimed negative health effects and the mechanisms that are alleged to be at their basis. We found that these authors inappropriately employ a deductive reasoning approach based on syllogism. We found that their conclusions are not supported by the available scientific evidence. Thus, the mechanisms and vast range of conditions proposed to result from glyphosate toxicity presented by Samsel and Seneff in their commentaries are at best unsubstantiated theories, speculations, or simply incorrect. This misrepresentation of glyphosate\u2019s toxicity misleads the public, the scientific community, and regulators. Although evidence exists that glyphosate-based herbicides are toxic below regulatory set safety limits, the arguments of Samsel and Seneff largely serve to distract rather than to give a rational direction to much needed future research investigating the toxicity of these pesticides, especially at levels of ingestion that are typical for human populations.\r<br>\r<br>Keywords: glyphosate, chronic disease, pesticides, toxicity, glycine, gluten sensitivity, cytochrome P450 enzyme system, microbiome", "comment_date": "2019-06-14T20:58:45Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Jayce Brattin", "comment_text": "As a farmer I\u2019m proud to see this video.

Think about it, today&#39;s farmers depend heavily on technology.  That technology is designed so that a 5 y/o can use most of it - it doesn&#39;t take a rocket scientist to figure out the basics of using a grain storage bin, or drive a tractor, or to drop off soil samples to the county ag dept., and many kids today can operate electronic gizmos better than the people who invent them. These farmers have numerous assets at their finger tips that answer any question they have about anything agricultural - it&#39;s called the county agricultural extension service, which is paid for by tax dollars!  Today&#39;s farmers are also heavily subsidized by the government, which is paid for by tax dollars.  Another thing that is characteristic of today&#39;s farmers is that most of them are commodity farmers who produce mono-crops,  and they are financed to the hilt (with government backed low interest loans - subsidized by tax payers) with all of the machinery and infrastructure that they need to be competitive; they rely on all of this infrastructure and technology so they don&#39;t have to work so hard.  If farmers were actually as smart as you think, then there would NOT be such a turn over in farming - meaning that many farms go bankrupt every year, and often because of poor management decisions, which includes being wiped out by a single natural event, like what happened this year in the midwest - because they seldom plan ahead in case of a bad year.  That last farmer told you that he relies on several other people who do marketing, etc. and without doing that most farms would go under.  If you really want to see what true farming is, then find a smaller operation that produces a wide variety of seasonal crops.  Some of these smaller operations make better profit margins than the mega farm operations because they are producing a product YEAR &#39;ROUND and harvesting every day, instead of getting one (maybe) two huge crops per year, and they do it with far less infrastructure and far less technology with far less expense.<br><br><br>I have nothing against farmers, because I am one (on a very small scale), but these mega farmers, who farm thousands of acres are NOT real farmers.  I worked for one of these &quot;mega&quot; farmers for a year right after retiring from the military because I wanted to see if I wanted to be a farmer --- and if you had them write down everything they do in a day for that whole year, they have VERY LITTLE time down doing farming!", "comment_date": "2019-06-14T18:11:57Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "BravoBear", "comment_text": "Why do I hear that it\u2019s bad for men to eat soy?

There are 2 reasons for this: 1 - the corn along the outside of the patch doesn&#39;t do as well (more competition with other species - in your case your yard) and 2: Corn is an &quot;open pollinated&quot; crop that relies on the wind to move the pollen to the silks to fertilize the grain. If you don&#39;t have many rows, that makes it harder for the wind to pollinate the crop as you end up blowing a lot of the pollen into your yard (and not onto the crop). Learned this the hard way myself. If you don&#39;t want to raise a huge crop, plant shorter rows in a square plot so that your plot is more rows &quot;wide&quot; and I bet the ones in the center do real well.

Think of the amount of water that grass takes....just to keep it green.  Then, think about what corn is primarily comprised of....the individual grains that is.... WATER.  Plus, grass takes a great deal of nutrients to keep it green as well as water...think about the root system of grass vs. corn.  They&#39;re similar is size and composition. Not exact but similar.  Also, another consideration is the type of grass you have....looks like a variety of Bermuda.  Bermuda sucks a LOT of water.  Theme here is WATER.  You&#39;ve obviously come to the conclusion that the border of grass around your corn plot is too narrow.  Experiment.  The grass sucks the water away from the corn decreasing growth and a few other things.  Corn requires a &quot;goldilocks&quot; amount of water.  The grass around your corn narrows your margin for error for that &quot;goldilocks&quot; zone.  So, widen the dirt border around the corn and see what happens.  Also, plant some marigolds at the border around the corn.  They a natural insect repellent that lowers the insect pests around your corn.

It reminds me of my car battery when my uncle tried charging it.  The old cars you can easily get to the jump points on the battery, but the newer models stuff the battery behind everything so the only way to get to it is to have a professional mechanic remove all the parts.

In order to achieve these traits like disease and pest resistance, scientists had to enhance the part of the grains that naturally resists disease and predators: mainly, the glutens, lectins, and phytates- the most harmful parts of the grains to humans. In addition, these hybridized strains are often allergen producing and usually sprayed with pesticides and chemicals.<br><br><br>&quot;It is interesting to note that some people who are allergic to modern strains of wheat show little to no reaction to (properly prepared) Einkorn wheat in <b>small</b> amounts.

It is wonderful to watch you with all your enthusiastic admiration of farmers that are businessmen, biologists, ingeneers thar must belong to the most clever people on earth. Yet I think different.

I think farmers are more like super precarious employees of a sick system where they where made addicted to cemical fertilizers and cemical pesticides from extra large companies. The number of bankrupt farmers is increasing every year and the only survival is to grow. If you dont grow, you will go under. And with the growth of the farm the vicious cycle of more cem fertlizers and more cem pesticides, herbicides or fungicides grabs to keep controlling that massively unnatural system of  monocropping. The average practices of a now adays industrial farmer contribute massively to the worlds biggest topsoil erosion and loss of fertility process, not to mention gene contamination of highly productive and climate adapted heritag seeds through gene manipulated varieties.<br>Shure. The life of a farmer es extremely exciting, as all aspects you mention make part of it, but these poor families live lifes based on destruction and constant loan thread.<br>Big scale industrial agriculture can only stop being that monster that it is when applying agroforestry and organic cropping in way smaller fields with way bigger diversity and no cemical fertilizers.<br>I love your videos and I share the fascination for the grain bin, but farmers are no biologists, or they would not work the way they do.", "comment_date": "2019-06-13T21:40:02Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Paul Pardee", "comment_text": "I think your cornses need to be in a square rather than a long rectangle.

My job was to basically clean around the plant and when it got busy during the harvest I would stand out in the sun all day directing trucks on where to go. Coolest part about it was they had what they called the pits and tunnels. Basically it&#39;s a series of networks that go underground around the plant to where the trucks drop the grain into a series of conveyor belts. It went about 20 feet underground. It&#39;s kinda scary at first to know that a 500 foot silo or bin in right above ground. I also had to climb the stair cases up to the grain bins to clean off around the conveyors. If you laid down on top of the bin you could feel the top of it moving up and down from all the pressure. One day one of the tops of the bin blew off because a sudden change in pressure differentiation due to heat and you&#39;d think we were starting WW3. One of the supervisors was a retired Marine and he just stood frozen in place when we all heard the sound. I think it gave him a PTSD attack for quite a while.
