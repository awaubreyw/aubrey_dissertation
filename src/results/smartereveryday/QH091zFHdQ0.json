You let the resistance of the water to slow you down relative to the wave, until the force of the turbulence passes you enough that paddling will have an effect, then time it right and you&#39;re back, often faster than if you fought it because that usually just makes the tumble worse.  It&#39;s not just conservation of energy, kicking and paddling in turbulence is a good way to pull a muscle (not sure if that last bit would apply to a fly, resistance being different in air) but the rest certainly would explain it&#39;s use as a natural reflex in flight.", "comment_date": "2016-04-12T16:17:20Z", "likes_count": 2}, {"comment_by": "Tholorin", "comment_text": "haha.. i get it..

Ducks will do exactly the same in the case of a close miss and will stop flapping from the pressure wave to right themselves, this gives a quick chance for a better followup shot XD. But this is even present when shooting at brittle clay targets on the trap line. People would ask me afterward in an accusing fashion why the target jumped, dipped down, or even slid left or right just after they shot.
