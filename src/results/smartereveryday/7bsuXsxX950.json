The problem we have is related to trees but it isn&#39;t the trees. The problem is our disturbance of the soil in particular the soil ecology . In a sense the soil is another world much like the world above ground. When we pull trees out of the ground or chop them down we essentially drastically alter the micro climate established in that area. The change affects the biology in the soil like fungai ,bacteria species and biology that all co depend on each other. When these links  between species reduces or collapses the ability for trees to feed collapses too. In this way for us to plant a trre into poor soil ( limited biodiversity /biology under ground ) is like dropping off a human in a desert like environment and expect them to survive. In my opinion this is a very ineffcient way to bring back an area from it&#39;s forested past. Add to this not only is the soil affected badly but the climate in that area , the balance between water evaporation to atmosphere and the water table below. The destruction of soils means that water cannot be retained by the soil but rather runs off into the streams and with it dragging any human compounds with it fertilizers, pesticides. Now we affect water ways and kill of the ecosystems in those regions. The effect of tree /forest cutting is so damaging that it is capable of collapsing regions completely or down to such a small scale of life that we stop absorbing quality nutrients because crops are so poor in natural nutrient. The mono culture in farming reduces the soil biology drastically and biodiversity and the regions begin to slowly decay of all wild life above and below ground. This is evident with bee population collapses but this is happening in many levels of animal and microbiology. The take away is to plant trees is extremely inefficient and costly , many trees may simply not be able to grow without intervention. What we need to plant or do is create soils environments that breed micro biology to build soil and this usually happens in an order from low grasses ,fungai to larger plants and trees.  Biodoverse soil allows for plant density ( just like our old forests) Not only can they self sustain extremely dense forest but the size of trees also becomes possible. Large trees 100&#39;s of years old of which many are now chopped down provide extremely deep biodiversity .Think of them as the natural sky scrapers reaching high into the sky but also very deep into the earth. That depth provides  robustness to the under life of the soil. Without the microbiological life in soil there are no plants ,no trees no humans. Create compost, and plant that everywhere and let the trees come naturally. Forests are the batteries of our source of air they provide us with stability and robusteness in climate and air for us to breathe.", "comment_date": "2019-12-08T15:44:41Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Anas Asif", "comment_text": "You guys do know its a scam to make 20mil right?", "comment_date": "2019-12-07T23:38:21Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Sjoer van der Ploeg", "comment_text": "Still not there!", "comment_date": "2019-12-06T21:31:42Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "ggplayz games", "comment_text": "If people are doing this for climate change that\u2019s kinda dumb because you prob think the worlds gonna end in a few years, I hate to tell ya but it takes sum years for a tree to grow", "comment_date": "2019-12-06T19:01:02Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "TheMeigsr", "comment_text": "Where do we put these 20000000 trees!", "comment_date": "2019-12-06T14:45:57Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "suprimedia", "comment_text": "owsome....", "comment_date": "2019-12-06T13:33:54Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Mr Freddo Renton", "comment_text": "The Australian Gumtree also depends on burning to grow", "comment_date": "2019-12-06T06:51:07Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Maksbyart", "comment_text": "You have to add paypal", "comment_date": "2019-12-06T05:30:26Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Ky", "comment_text": "Hold up - I want to hear about the spacecraft your dad assembled!

This, however, became a problem, since more and more dead, combustible matter starts accumulating on the ground. This causes  wildfires, when they do occur, to burn way more violently than they would\u2019ve if we hadn\u2019t intervened and stopped them from occurring in the first place.

Are they actually planting &quot;trees&quot; and jump-starting reforestation, or are they dropping tree pucks from the air?<br>2. Those shrubs are carbon sinks as well, and they&#39;ll grow without any intervention or fundraising needed.<br>3. Those shrubs pave the way for the &quot;trees&quot; to come later. While trees can be planted to speed up the &quot;forest&quot;, it will happen by itself as well (except, perhaps due to warmer climates, see below)<br>4. If we&#39;re raising $20mil to replant the same kinds of trees that won&#39;t regrow due to the climate, are we wasting the money being used to plant them?<br>5. While I love fundraising and charity, charitable organizations are prone to corruption and misuse like any human organization, especially when very large amounts get involved. Who is overseeing this fundraiser and actually holding the Arbor Day people accountable, or, who is counting the trees being planted and the use of the funds? I mean, if we&#39;re just going to drop seed pucks, that can be done for a lot less than $1/tree.<br>6. Planting trees where none are currently growing will take a lot of conditioning of the ground or maintenance of the plants to ensure they actually grow, or we can just drop them into recently logged areas which means we&#39;ve just saved the logging companies a whole lot of money doing a job they are already paying to have done (more profits for them to keep!) They log an area, sell the lumber, plant trees, wait 50 years and log it again, like a slow-harvestijg garden. So, patting ourselves on the back to do their work for free seems kinda weird.

Few trees can do that but far more trees can out compete Cyprus in the sandy loam so the Cyprus is relegated to where it can tolerate.
