Fast forward eight years and I&#39;m still stumped.<br>Growing up around a farm, I could always be found with a trusty Red Ryder \u00a9 BB gun. And when I was younger, I used to go below a low water to where I was about level and I would shoot the water. I used to watch the bbs skip across for as far as I could see. <br>Now I understand this is kind of the same principle as skipping a rock across the water; the thing that has perplexed me is this: I can manage to get bbs to skip across the water even when I&#39;m looking down at the water. My barrel is probably close to a 45\u00b0 angle. <br>This question has plagued me for eight years. I&#39;m a huge fan and have been for 7 years.

Then even if the combustion goes to 100% completion, you still have a large excess of un-reacted hairspray fluid because there was no more oxygen left, and that excess fluid is  then ejected along with the projectile.  <br>Maybe you could test spray excess (radius of visible spray in high speed camera) vs fuel input amount (canister nozzle time). Instead of breaking a mirror for each shot you can probably use just one and avoid aiming directly at it, or perhaps make a hole and shoot inside the hole.

What got me to suspect this is how the potato, not just the metal, broke through the shell leaving a perfect cut-out.I think you touched up on it later in the video with burn-rates. Basically with just the potato, its so light it moves down the barrel faster. This not only means the fuel isn&#39;t pressurized (which reduces combustion), but also means the potato leaves the gun before all of it burns. When you added the metal the heavier bullet had more inertia, which moved much slower. This kept the volume low, and the potato slow to start allowing a full combustion.<br><br>If you wanted to test this, you could do it fairly easily. Get a board and paint it white, then add black lines every inch. Film the potato launcher shooting across is in slow motion both with and without the metal. You can then use the camera to time how long each projectile took to pass one inch. Using that velocity, and the mass of the bullet you can calculate the kinetic energy: KE = 1/2*m*v^2. Then, because energy is force times distance, and force is pressure times area you can calculate the average pressure in the tube: E=F*d --&gt; 1/2*m*v^2 = F*d --&gt; 1/2*m*v^2 = P*A*d\u00a0--&gt; P = (m*v^2) / (2*A*d) with m being the mass of the bullet, v being its calculated velocity, A being the area of a cross section of the barrel, and d being the length of the barrel.<br><br>Anyway, I just thought it might be interesting to see if the metal just gave a hard surface to break through the shell, or if the extra mass actually gave the bullet more energy.
