That could potentially save minutes of in rescue operations to measure the drift 2.)

For example, if the search target is a person in the water, the standard track line spacing is 0.1 nm. (Helo standard spacing on the 0.1 nm spacing, different search platforms may have different track line spacing) A small kayak, might have a track line spacing of 0.25.  These are typically applied towards the CS and PS search patterns.  However, this is also put into consideration on a VS search as well... and  the track spacing is effectively the same a the leg length used in the VS search pattern.<br><br>Also, the helicopters and fixed wing aircraft have radio equippeed data marker bouys; when arriving on scene one of the first tasks is drop a DMB and one of last is to relocate the DMB and then pass that data back to the RCC (Rescue Coord Center).  This is then used to determine the set and drift; which then is used to adjust the search plan as each phase of the search progresses.  <br><br>One really important point for those who head out on the water and want the best chance of being found... DO NOT RELY ON A CELL PHONE!!!!!  Take a hand held radio, ALL CG assetts are equipped to monitor and DIRECTION FIND on marine band radios (and even othe readio frequencies) most CG assetts CAN NOT DIRECTION FIND on a cell phone signal.  This can drastically increase your chances of being found... even a cheap BAO FENG radio can be programmed with VHF frequencies and would allow person in distress to be found quickly.  That radio costs about $40.<br><br>As a point of reference, a human head is about the size of a basket ball... so place that in the water and try to find it from 600 feet away... it is really tough.<br><br>A few other safety tips...<br> File a float plan, have life jackets and make sure the jackets have retro-reflective tape - at night it can really increase your chances of detection in the water.  Signal flares and mirrors also work.  Consider taking a safe boating course via the USCG.  <br><br>Keep in mind, safe trips on the water do not happen by accident... they happen by careful and discrete planning that is done well before you cast the lines off the boat.  (I will also add this applies to those who fly small general aviation aircraft over the water!)<br><br>Most SAR cases are rooted in a &#39;failure of imagination&#39;, the victims off failed to imagine that things could go wrong.<br><br>Getting smarter every day will help you be safer every day too...<br>I love your channel<br><br>John", "comment_date": "2022-01-22T18:08:40Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "RicktheRecorder", "comment_text": "&#39;The air&#39; ???.

TA is all well and good but I find it truly baffling that all major crypto youtubers just look at pure TA and completely ignore the bigger narrative of why BTC is pumping and why the future outlook might not be as rosy as it seems. It&#39;s kinder irresponsible to ignore the fact that each ETF launch so far has caused a major dump at the peaks of BTC. We were already on shaky footing with historically low volume and almost pure whale pumps, narrowly avoiding a long-term bear market. This is the worst possible time in history to invest as so many don&#39;t back up their crypto assets.. More emphasis should be put into day tradng as it is less affected by the unpredictable nature of the market....I have made over 7 btc from day tradng with Prof Edward Rowe insights and signals in less than 2 weeks, this is one of the best medium to backup your assets in case it goes bearish,.

About two hours before sundown five miles out, I twisted the bushing out of my I/O propeller returning to the marina.  I switched to my small outboard motor to hobble in from a snorkeling trip.  A thunderstorm between me and shore suddenly developed within minutes with high winds and six foot waves which started pushing my small fly-bridge cruiser out into the Gulf through a series of shallow reefs.  My outboard didn&#39;t have enough power to even turn into the wind and the huge waves were washing over the outboard most of the time as we were pushed sideways by the wind so I shut it down before it sucked in sea water. The sky turned black as the sun went down.  We could no longer see the reefs in the dark.  The lightning was right on top of my boat and things were getting desperate.  My wife called the Coast Guard about our situation with children on board.  Their only question was if we were sinking.  We said no, not yet.  They refused to come out and told us to throw the anchor and they would call a commercial tow company. The anchor hit the bottom but would not hook up as we were blown miles in the dark. When the anchor did finally hook up it rolled my boat on its side as it pulled the anchor line tight.  Luckily everyone was down below or we would have been thrown out of the boat. The commercial tow company radioed that they would not come out because of the severity of the storm affected their GPS.  In those days I could only afford a Loran and charts to navigate which wasn&#39;t accurate enough in the dark with the reefs surrounding us.  After about half an hour of pounding in large waves and lightning with thunder right on top of us, the storm ended.  The commercial tow finally arrived.  Had our boat hit the surrounding jagged reefs in the dark it would have been a tragic ending.  At the time I didn&#39;t think that even the Coast Guard could have arrived in time but I still have bitter feelings that they refused to try.", "comment_date": "2022-01-21T22:01:22Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Samuel K.

Back in the 70&#39;s when I was a Coast Guard Helo pilot there were no computers, GPS, calculators, or autopilots. We did expanding squares, parrallel lines, track lines, and creeping patterns. We calculated it manually on out knee pads with a Jeppsen flight computer. What we did have, if we had an approximate position, was a datum marker buoy. It was a radio transmitter with a flashing light that we dropped. It drifted with the current and it made it easier particularly for expanding square patterns as your turn points were specific radio directional headings to the datum. Of course we also had to compensate for the wind which was different from the current since the aircraft was affected by the wind and the wind over the body of water was different from at base so our heading on each leg had to be offset. Things are a lot more complicated. A body is mainly carried by the current but a boat or raft is also affected by the wind from the amount of surface area above the water. Then, is there a sea drogue deployed or not which would give a compromise between wind and water. The wind is constantly changing so how long has it been since the event and how long is the search taking. A storm system going through changes wind direction as it passes. There is fetch which is surface current from long term wind versus ocean current such as the Gulf Stream. They may actually be going in the opposite direction. Waves, though they mainly are going up and down also effects drift by causing slippage for a boat or raft. Things are a lot easier now for the pilots with onboard computers and autopilots that will fly the search pattern allowing the pilots and crew to spend more time looking outside for that tiny dot of a head or life jacket in rough seas. I actually got to do the prototype testing on the first aircraft flir systems which really helps out. Destin, are you sure you really want to get into this deep stuff? Enjoy all the math.

Anyway, geometric flight patterns for moving air and geometric search patterns for moving water.

Distance (yds) traveled divided by 100= speed in kts and we did in all in our heads in real time. For example if the target moves 300 yards in 3 minutes they are doing 3 kts.

We didn&#39;t have GPS back then, so did almost all our searches by compass.<br>Fast forward to today, and I participate in searches with the Civil Air Patrol. We do sector searches in airplanes, so this search model is very familiar to me. But instead of drift, we have to deal with wind speed at altitude, since the wind will blow you off course. That is compensated by crabbing into the wind and applying more or less power, depending on upwind or downwind legs of the search.<br>One thing that confused me with this Coastie search was that the guy timing downstream and upstream legs said it took &quot;x&quot; seconds to do each leg, and he was using the same amount of time for up or down stream. So, I assume that the boatswain mate reduced throttle down current and increased it up current in order to compensate for the current, right?<br>Anyway, you should do a similar comparison for a CAP sector search.

These do normally apply with the Parallel, Creeping and Trackline but could be applied to drifting patterns.  As stated in the video Sector&#39;s normally send those but if they cant or don&#39;t in time we could compute the same patterns if we know the object and add in the &quot;On Scene&quot; Weather.

In perfectly still water, sure this looks like a great way to fully search a circular area in the ocean by cutting it into triangular pie pieces, but as the wind/current increases to the level depicted here warping the search pattern this much it seems like a simple zig zag following a straight center line would accomplish the same coverage if not better coverage without having to waste extra time and fuel looping back in on yourself as shown here in this strange pattern...", "comment_date": "2022-01-19T12:07:32Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Fernandus Aditya", "comment_text": "In Indonesia we use that finger gun whistle for calling bus  :v", "comment_date": "2022-01-19T12:06:00Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Stn VndnBr", "comment_text": "&quot;They all float differently&quot;", "comment_date": "2022-01-19T12:02:44Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Timeyy", "comment_text": "YOU HAVE TO FOLD BACK YOUR TONGUE?<br><br>Mind = blown", "comment_date": "2022-01-19T12:02:43Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "rebel chick", "comment_text": "Yaaaay I tried the whistle for the very first time an it worked that is so awesome", "comment_date": "2022-01-19T11:57:59Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Bill Fancher", "comment_text": "Haha I went to bootcamp with Lebeouf who taught you how to whistle\ud83d\ude02", "comment_date": "2022-01-19T11:56:56Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Miner 2049er", "comment_text": "Datum is the singular form of data, as any CS student can tell.", "comment_date": "2022-01-19T11:56:04Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Tin117man", "comment_text": "The next series you need to do army artillery", "comment_date": "2022-01-19T11:44:28Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Ash", "comment_text": "This is fascinating", "comment_date": "2022-01-19T11:42:36Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "wompaper", "comment_text": "I&#39;m baffled the smarter-every-day dude didn&#39;t know whistling with your fingers was a thing...

Coming from Germany, it&#39;s interesting to see the coast guard beeing (pretty much) solely responsible for SAR missions. In Germany, the DGzRS, founded in 1865, is in charge of that. They are an independent organization working closely with the organs of the state, sporting 300 employees and 1500 volunteers at 55 stations, running 40 smaller SAR vessels and 20 cruisers (all enclosed, self righting, the cruisers also equiped with a tender), the flagship &quot;Hermann Marwede&quot; beeing the largest cruiser built solely for SAR missions worldwide to date, with a helipad and all the beels and whistles. <br>The coast guard will assist SAR missions on water if needed, while airborne SAR duties are carried out by the Bundeswehr and the Bundespolizei. For that reason, by comparison, our coast guard has a much more limited scope of tasks (basically it&#39;s only naval safety supervision, crime prevention and customs duties) and is rather small, sporting only 25 (larger) cruisers and tugs and a couple of helicopters. They will get assistance from the German Navy if need be of course. <br>That said, we have rather limited amounts of shore line, but some of the heaviest naval conditions on earth with the north see right at our doorstep, so its a very different situation compared to the US, and I totally understand why this concept wouldn&#39;t exactly work out in the US. So it&#39;s really fascinating to see the differences, yet also the similarities in day to day operation.<br>Interesting fact: those search patterns actually are the reason why we call our SAR ships &quot;cruisers&quot;.", "comment_date": "2022-01-19T08:19:51Z", "likes_count": 16}, {"comment_by": "Daniel Kays", "comment_text": "I am so happy that you are raising awareness of the U.S. Coast Guard.

The Auxiliary taught people to be safer boaters and avoid becoming victims. Usually, the ones we rescued missed those classes. We also did law enforcement patrols to protect our shores and natural resources. Coast Guard ATON units, the black boats took care of all the aids to navigation and the red cutters are ice breakers. They love to back and ram. Or at least that&#39;s what their tee shirts claim. The helicopter swimmers are like the Coast Guard&#39;s special forces. After a hero with Navy Seals swimmers who rescue downed pilots assisted on a mission in the early 80s, rescuing victims too exhausted to get in a basket on their own,  the Coast Guard recognized that we needed the same resources, the Coast Guard AST&#39;s were born.

This maneuver is a ground reference maneuver where the speed over the ground determines your height above the object \u201cpivotal altitude\u201d where as you turn around the reference point, the object will stay under a specific area of the aircrafts wing. Just as drift comes into play in the search and rescue mission, the velocity of the wind will affect the ground speed of the aircraft. Instead of using the throttle to control the ground speed, the pilot will vary the altitude of the aircraft in order to stay at the pivotal altitude. We also enter the maneuver with the wind at our tail as the cost guard enters the grid with the drift behind them. The reason we start this maneuver with a tailwind is because the faster your ground speed, the higher the pivotal altitude. Being a \u201cfixed power maneuver\u201d it is preferable to descend and gain airspeed than to climb and lose airspeed.

Their job was to locate the stricken ship and relay the coordinates to the nearest surface vessel. They did that, and were orbiting around the sinking trawler when something went horribly wrong and their plane went into the sea, killing all aboard.

It&#39;s good to see someone talking about what the Coast Guard does to help their fellow man in distress.  It&#39;s not talked about much, and I wish things like this was publicized more.  I think it would benefit the Coast Guard greatly.    I had a lot of fun in the Coast Guard, there&#39;s a lot of real good, and dedicated men and women hard at work 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, 365 days a year to do only one small part of the Coast Guard&#39;s job.   I don&#39;t regret the time I served, and I&#39;d gladly do it again without hesitation.   I remember one SAR case I got involved in.  I was on a cutter returning from a Narcotics Patrol in the Caribbean, on our way home when we got tagged to do a SAR for a sailboat.  It was almost an all hands effort,  even I had  pair of binoculars and was looking for them.  I made a comment to one my fellow watchstanders saying &quot;it&#39;s too bad we don&#39;t have a helo onboard&quot;.   I noticed the Captain jerked his head up and stared at me, then left the bridge.   The next morning we had a helo onboard.

It definitely floats through the water differently than a log. And it floats through the water differently depending on exactly what you do with the sails, which is why I find it funny that this was so surprising to you.", "comment_date": "2022-01-18T20:48:07Z", "likes_count": 2}, {"comment_by": "Marpa", "comment_text": "Amazing video as always!

The idea was to toss it over the side  if anyone ever went overboard.  The unit would act like the datum in this video, floating close to the person in the water as well as being a visual marker easy to see above the waves.   In recent years these poles have largely disappeared from boats in favor of GPS chart plotters where you can fix a waypoint if anyone goes overboard and the gps will bring you back to the waypoint. BUT the waypoint will be fixed in space and unlike the person in the water will not drift with the current and wind.  So the old fashioned MOB pole seems like a better tool to recover an overboard crew member  than the newfangled GPS method.", "comment_date": "2022-01-18T20:43:22Z", "likes_count": 33}, {"comment_by": "Niccol\u00f2 Baccega", "comment_text": "<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aoXJfuPaFF8&amp;t=8m25s\">8:25</a> that awesome mix vol.1 tat is...

Since NOAA was responsible for making charts of U.S. waters it was important that submerged hazards be accurately positioned. Difficult problem since often times the original sinking report was only very approximate. Knowing that a wreck would drift we used a CG program that calculated the most likely drift pattern over time. With that we knew better where to start a search pattern. Finding something floating is difficult, but once it sinks the problem becomes even more difficult. Thanks to the CG we were able to cut the time required to search and thereby reduce the cost.

The huge advantage is that it is less muted than a standard whistle because the mouth is more open.

Not only is he extremely passionate about what he does, but he also legitimately enjoys showing and teaching people about all of the incredible and awesome things that he shows in his videos. He makes learning fun... He isn&#39;t afraid to admit when he doesn&#39;t know something or learns of a new way or method of doing something. He is so very humble and honest, and he genuinely gets a kick out of people learning something new, right along with him. I&#39;m having a hard time finding the right words to describe what makes him, and this channel, so great... but I think that most people that watch his videos and are reading my comment likely know exactly what I&#39;m trying to say here. He is far from being a try hard, unlike NDT and Bill Nye, who try to use big words and deflect when they are asked about something they don&#39;t know...  He doesn&#39;t try to portray himself as both smarter than he is or that he is knowledgeable about anything and everything that someone might ask about. <br>In general, I just wanted to say thank you, Destin, for what you do... Showing that science and learning can be a load of fun, and teaching so many people about things that can absolutely become useful to them in the future. I personally believe that science teachers of all grades should take advantage of the wealth of information that exists in your library of videos, so that they can effectively teach kids in a way that keeps them captivated and helps then to retain the information that they&#39;ve learned.", "comment_date": "2022-01-18T16:51:23Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Growing Answers", "comment_text": "I didn\u2019t know you were the exact same age as me, Destin.
