In the elastic domain, stress and strain (deformation) are linearly dependant. The slope of the stress stain curve in the elastic domain is what&#39;s know as Young&#39;s Modulus (E). Also, as you venture into the plastic domain, when you remove the force (or stress), it does not follow the plastic curve back to zero as you show in your animation. At the point where the stress is removed, the you draw a line that has the same slope as the elastic portion of the curve (equal to E). At zero force (or stress) this straight line will intersect at a given strain (or deformation) which is equal to the permanent set.

The red number is what is known as a 90-compression structure, meaning that it reaches optimal compression and energy transfer at 90mph.  The black number indicates a 100-compression structure, meaning - you guessed it - that it reaches optimal compression and energy transfer at 100mph.<br><br>Granted, the disintegration of the older ball could have numerous variables contributing to the deconstitution of the cover and internal banding, including oxidation of the cover, long-term distress from use, element exposure, repeated compression, as well as the difference due to improvements in the ballistic and elastic technology made in the intervening years since the older ball&#39;s design.

The materials in the old golf ball had aged and become MUCH less elastic.  It  is probably less about the construction, and more about the simple age of the materials.  The driver head failure doesn&#39;t surprise me at all.  I caved in and cracked a number of the early metal driver heads, just swinging them manually.  The newer driver heads are considerably stronger (for a while they made some with Kevlar), but 500 mph is so far beyond what a human can produce, it really couldn&#39;t go any other way.<br><br><br>It&#39;s probably worth mentioning that when a good golfer swings a driver, the shaft is actually flexed forward by the moment of impact.  That may not make sense until you study the mechanics of a human golf swing, but it is true.  The forward flex of the shaft is ready made to absorb a portion of the impact of collision, so the club head isn&#39;t taking it all.", "comment_date": "2020-03-16T16:16:14Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Cracks Leon", "comment_text": "Toe&#39;d it a bit, but it&#39;ll do!", "comment_date": "2020-03-16T14:19:50Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "TTV.NinjaScout_ 24", "comment_text": "<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JT0wx27J9xs&amp;t=11m08s\">11:08</a> <br><br>The ball: I\u2019m about to ruin this mans whole career", "comment_date": "2020-03-16T14:16:11Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "fattyz1", "comment_text": "I think you were a little lite on the tarping with the watermelon?

Like Myth Busters supersonic ping pong ball, the vacuum is critical to high velocity.

I suggest using a longer barrel with a cross fitting at the muzzle end and vacuum storage chambers connected to the sides of the cross. The chambers would keep the pressure at the end of the barrel lower, even with more leakage around the ball.", "comment_date": "2019-12-29T15:18:44Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "incog", "comment_text": "<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JT0wx27J9xs&amp;t=6m56s\">6:56</a> The ball looking like a mouth there", "comment_date": "2019-12-29T13:47:34Z", "likes_count": 79}, {"comment_by": "Serana Hoshimiya", "comment_text": "Rip water melon", "comment_date": "2019-12-29T11:00:53Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "SFS teacher", "comment_text": "<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JT0wx27J9xs&amp;t=6m58s\">6:58</a> me when I&#39;m trying not to puke", "comment_date": "2019-12-29T10:16:23Z", "likes_count": 5}, {"comment_by": "Danny", "comment_text": "dose he have to yell every time?", "comment_date": "2019-12-29T09:21:07Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Joel Choe", "comment_text": "I\u2019ve just thought about all the military potential in this", "comment_date": "2019-12-29T07:38:36Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "insert name here", "comment_text": "Did anyone else see the fire ball on one of the anvil strikes", "comment_date": "2019-12-29T06:37:47Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "4FIVE HD", "comment_text": "WACK MY BALL", "comment_date": "2019-12-29T05:20:15Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Nyuztov", "comment_text": "World war 3:<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>Use golf ball to fight against M1A1 Abrams", "comment_date": "2019-12-29T05:18:56Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Adriel Quiroga", "comment_text": "I want my head to be that watermelon", "comment_date": "2019-12-29T04:49:28Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Richard Chadwick", "comment_text": "I&#39;m dying laughing at the cartoon thing, I&#39;m a golfer and I actually learn something. thank you", "comment_date": "2019-12-29T03:21:06Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Hayden Petty", "comment_text": "Golf club: ah you are aproching me<br><br>Cuts to scene of Dio dying", "comment_date": "2019-12-29T02:17:29Z", "likes_count": 12}, {"comment_by": "Mike Schiavoni", "comment_text": "Elastic memory...", "comment_date": "2019-12-29T00:57:22Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "brazyj", "comment_text": "mythbusters did a better job", "comment_date": "2019-12-29T00:47:37Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "R0CK3T", "comment_text": "Hey SmarterEveryDay I have a question about that elastic and plastic force thing, is that kind of like how bones break, like bones are in the plastic force thing?", "comment_date": "2019-12-29T00:30:13Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "R0CK3T", "comment_text": "golf ball in outer space: hey<br>aliens: hey<br>aliens: WHAT", "comment_date": "2019-12-29T00:28:24Z", "likes_count": 1694}, {"comment_by": "GmannnRL", "comment_text": "Imperial terms: 500mph <br><br>Destin terms: Stupid fast<br><br><br>Edit: thanks for 1k likes!", "comment_date": "2019-12-28T23:38:02Z", "likes_count": 1384}, {"comment_by": "DisKorruptd", "comment_text": "okay, but what if you combine two terrifying ideas and fire the ball at the rocket club?", "comment_date": "2019-12-28T22:09:12Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Detective Armadillo", "comment_text": "<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JT0wx27J9xs&amp;t=11m15s\">11:15</a><br>Nice", "comment_date": "2019-12-28T21:21:13Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Mr. hrfister", "comment_text": "Hey Superman, did you borrow one of my drivers again without permission?", "comment_date": "2019-12-28T21:11:35Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Dane Tadsen", "comment_text": "Magical ^_^", "comment_date": "2019-12-28T21:04:47Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "mrpigclimber", "comment_text": "<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JT0wx27J9xs&amp;t=5m13s\">5:13</a> me listening to my friend being smart", "comment_date": "2019-12-28T19:57:38Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "\u0389\u03a3\u039bVY \u039b\u041fG\u042fY B\u1102\u04e8\u1103K M\u03a3\u1103\u0389", "comment_text": "7 mouths later in germany <br><br>me: OUCH WAS WAR DAS \ud83d\ude21\ud83d\ude21\ud83d\ude21<br>english Ouch what was that \ud83d\ude21\ud83d\ude21\ud83d\ude21", "comment_date": "2019-12-28T19:46:39Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "tree003a", "comment_text": "did you see the watermelons face before it got hit?", "comment_date": "2019-12-28T17:12:52Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "\u0110\u1ee9c Ph\u1ea1m", "comment_text": "shot the helmets with that gun pls", "comment_date": "2019-12-28T16:47:05Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Jon P", "comment_text": "how can 9k people dislike this????

Age and temperature can cause the inner cores or outer shell to loose some of their elastic properties, then the crack often actually happens when the then compromised ball is hit with a bad strike from an Iron. In a bad strike the force of the strike can be concentrated on an edge of the iron meaning that while there may actually be less overall force transferred to the ball, there can be more force transferred in a confined area like the edge of an iron (e.g. less force but more force per inch of contact) this can be sufficient to make a ball appear as if it was cut (typically its the outer shell that becomes compromised).

I agree that it sounds possible, but I have a small story...<br><br>At my apartment, we have a really large gate with horizontal railings across. When I was young, I used to climb up on the gate and just swing back and forth with great force, which produced enough momentum to move the gate in any direction I desired.<br><br>So what I propose is, can we make EM drives work my using short pulses of... Whatever they generated to produce some 10^-10 something Milli-newtons of force and just amplify the pulses?<br><br>I think it was protons on the inside which made the EM drive work, according to the article anyway?<br><br>But how do EM drives even work? They say it doesn&#39;t obey the Laws of Physics... The third I think....<br>Then what happened with the gate ? Wasn&#39;t that momentum? Even right now, I can just move my chair( it&#39;s on wheels) by simply exerting a force on the chair, without touching the ground. Is it just because of air resistance or does it have something to do with my momentum too?<br><br>I would like you to make a future video about EM Drives and how they work, about why they &#39;don&#39;t&#39; work, and how someone from the 1900s made it work?", "comment_date": "2019-05-06T16:59:51Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Occapella", "comment_text": "Now do a collab with William Osman and Michael Reeves.

The Chicken Gun fires raw chickens of several caliber sizes.

It is amazing the damage even a small bird can do to aircraft flying at high speed. <br><br>As for the golf ball hitting the club, I hope you guys achieve one hitting hard enough to lodge inside the club. It would make an assume trophy!<br>On another note, <br><br>I was surprised at the older golf ball. I remember as a kid we would cut them apart to see what was inside. In some of the early golf balls inside all that rubber band stuff, was a smaller rubber ball. The old ones were filled with a liquid (Liquid Cores) that was hazardous and were manufactured in to the 1980&#39;s. I remember hearing reports of kids dissecting liquid core golf balls that exploded causing injuries  because of some crystals that formed in that liquid, also well in to the 80&#39;s. The crystals would cause the explosion when crushed. That can also happen today with some PVC glue primers, the purple stuff. It can form crystals in the threaded area of the cap and go off when the cap is unscrewed.", "comment_date": "2019-05-06T05:34:46Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Jordan Mayer", "comment_text": "No one is talking about the golf ball sparking against the anvil at <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JT0wx27J9xs&amp;t=7m29s\">7:29</a>?", "comment_date": "2019-05-06T05:31:56Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Jordan T", "comment_text": "Gimme a smooooch! <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JT0wx27J9xs&amp;t=13m19s\">13:19</a>", "comment_date": "2019-05-06T05:29:21Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Adam Carter", "comment_text": "When I was a teen I took a golf ball into the street to see how high I could bounce it.

One could easily solve this problem by adding a reservoir of vacuum near the end. What I mean by that is adding a small pipe (Or a few on each side) Leading out of the side of the barrel near the pipe to a container of some sort (It doesn&#39;t need to be large, but as your barrel length increases, so should the size of the area for this) to allow the air in front of the ball to evacuate and make way for the ball itself. This would remove the pressure reversal as the ball reaches the end of the barrel, and increase the ball&#39;s speed.", "comment_date": "2019-05-04T05:49:40Z", "likes_count": 4}, {"comment_by": "Operator 801", "comment_text": "Oh yeah, Mark.

I just wanted to point something out and ask if you know an answer to my problem as well. I&#39;m not particularly studying material science but we had a course what gave an overview of it and there they taught us that if the material is in the elastic zone it is close to Hooke&#39;s Law (straight line) and when you go to plastic zone then its curved (quite the same way you showed). The thing what confused me wasn&#39;t exactly the linear relation but rather that you showed on the graph that if you go to plastic region and let go the force-distance line stays the same but we were taught that if you let go from the plastic region you have to go back on a straight line (Hooke&#39;s Law) with the same angle as if it was when you deformed it. But as you start going back on a straight line right away, you end up a little right on your distance line (when force is 0) and this is what describes the actual plastic deformation what we can see when no force is deforming material (the paperclip stays in a different position or the golf ball gets a new shape). But how would this logic be carried out in such an example where we can&#39;t express elastic region as linear equation between force and distance, as you showed. Do we actually know what type of equation describes the elastic bending? How will it work out if the point of going back happens to be higher than the elastic region reaches? Maybe you are more familiar with this kind of graphing and math with pressure tests.

Then, you can compare two velocities: the sound velocity of waves in the golf ball and the velocity of something hitting the golf ball or vice versa the golf ball hitting something. When a golf ball bounces, you can see that the sound wave looks much faster than the ball and it quickly bounces off. <br><br>Turns out that the speed of sound in a solid is related to &quot;Young&#39;s Modulus&quot; which relates forces and deformation. One oversimplified way to think about Young&#39;s Modulus is the energy per volume holding something together: each volume of stuff has a number of atoms, and each atom is bound to other atoms, and each atomic bond has some amount of energy ~ electron volt (eV). If you put enough energy into a small region of golf ball so that the energy per atom is high enough to break the bonds, the golf ball breaks. I think there is some focusing of energy into a small part of the ball. Atomic bond energy per volume is also related to heat capacity and this is also why the golf ball gets hot (and related to why hot things melt). <br><br>If you type &quot;(1 eV / proton mass)*gram* cm^-3&quot; into Google you&#39;ll find this equals Gigapascals. That&#39;s because order of magnitude each atomic bond ~ 1 eV of energy, 1 gram/proton mass / cm^3 is very very roughly # of atoms per cubic centimeter.
