This provides a point for pressure to escape. As it does the now pressurized upper portion of the liquid volume suddenly experiences a reversal of movement as it seeks the point of low pressure.

However, it&#39;s interesting to note that the bottle material surrounding the cap is moving upwards while the cap is moving down at one point in the process.  This is likely due to the non compressible fluid being forced upwards by the pressure wave and initially causing the material surrounding the cap to expand.  THEN, with material expansion at maximum but the fluid inertia continuing forward, the low pressure in the lower portion of the bottle provides a pressure release through the center of the water column once the advancing column meets the terminus of the bottle interior with it&#39;s curved (even though roughly so) surface redirecting the flow towards the center and downward.....and thus towards the low pressure zone which then contributes to the downward flow.<br><br>Meanwhile the poor cap, it&#39;s stem mounted in the cross sectional center of now highly fatigued and stressed plastic, is dragged downwards through the weakend but still high pressure outer portion of the top of the bottle.

Because the explosion is at the bottom, the closest &quot;walls&quot; are the areas within a 2-3 in radius get puffed out because the water can&#39;t compress. This happens closer to the point of detonation because the shock hits it sooner. Because of that, the water farthest away from the impact has to fill the space. This water that&#39;s farther away has to move to fill that space, and the only way it can move in the opposite direction of the blast is through the creation of a low pressure cavity created from  other molecules of water moving away from the point of detonation.

It is entirely possible it get gunpoweder to expolode in a non-sealed containor simply by placing the material in a small enough space so that the molucles are close enough together so that there is a more rapid transfer of heat between them which cuases them to burn fast enough to cuase an explosion.

Personally I&#39;m a demolitions explosive in the military, don&#39;t get me wrong I&#39;m not a civilian explosive engineer, however at my level of education I have had extensive training and education on the matter. From my understanding is that an explosive is defined as a gas that expands equally in all directions, however it travels the path of least resistance, I.E. If I set it on the ground, most the force with travel in a half orb away from the ground, as opposed to if I throw it in the air, the explosive force would travel in more of a sphere.  Also, once the explosion occurs, it causes what&#39;s called over pressure, there are four types of over pressure, direct, indirect, reflective, and residual. Direct is the total pressure of the explosive ( depending on the distance you are from the point of ignition) incidental is half the pressure after passing around defilade (cover, such as a wall or door) reflective is the pressure that bounces of a solid object and doubles, however decreases in pressure much more rapidly, (say there is a corner three feet from an explosion, by the time the pressure wave hit the first wall in the corner, it may be at 3 ft lbs of pressure, when it bounces off the wall it will immediately be 6 ft lbs of pressure, however it will dissipate much more quickley and by the time it hits the wall a few inches away it may only be at 1 ft lbs of pressure, where it will obviously turn into 2 ft lbs of pressure and dissipate once the negative and positive pressures in the area are equalized. And lastly there is residual pressure, this is the overall pressure left after an explosion in an area (particularly enclosed areas) this pressure can actually be felt in rooms shortly after a charge has detonated until the pressure in that room equalizes. Another phenomenon that occurs when dealing with explosives and overpressure is what happens to the surrounding pressure once there is an ignition. You see pressure is relatively equal depending on altitude and climate, and a few other factors but I&#39;ll wait for that. When an explosion occurs it pushes all the pressure outwards and creates a negatively pressurized void or orb, once the negative pressure expands to the point that the positive pressure is equal (this primarily depends on how violent the explosion was) it stops, then positive pressure rushes in, however to put it in laments terms it rushes in to quickly and creates negative pressure around it, so it has to expand again, and the process is repeated (very quickly mind you) until the pressure is returned to normal, if you would like to see an excellent demonstration of this watch a video of nuclear test and pay attention to the trees, notice how they bend all the way one way, as the dust rushes past them, and then back again, as the dust rushes back, they keep doing this back and forth rapidly and a little less each time until they are back to normal. What I believe is causing the collapse of the kid is a combination of both theories. What is interesting about using an explosive, and I use that term lightly in this case as black powder is hardly an explosive, however creates the perfect subject in this case, in a case, and in water which is much more dense than air, is that essentially you are creating an environment that creates all four types of overpressure very rapidly, keep in mind that reflective pressure also bounces off other pressure waves, I believe this is why you see the bubbles forming in an single area, now with the explosive being on the bottom of the bottle and the design if the bottle, I believe that the explosives least resistant path is on the bottom, and that is why the bottom blows out, from the sides obviously, now with the top being much stronger than the bottom what we are seeing essentially is reflective pressure from the waves hitting the too and coming down, and residual pressure of the negative pressure and positive pressure trying to equalize very quickly, I also believe with the water rushing from the bottom of the bottle, it is essentially pulling the water out of the bottom, which creates another negative void in the top of the bottle, (which is why the lid comes down) now remember that reflective pressure I keep talking about? And the fact that pressure takes the path if least resistance? Well I believe this pushes the weaker walls of the battle up around the lid as the reflective pressure bounces back. Now like I said I don&#39;t have a degree in the science and mechanics of this, and those that do could probably tear my hypothesis apart, however from my understanding and experience with explosives and overpressure I believe you created an extensive and quite unique environment to study an explosion, I would like to see how different objects would react when filled with water and blown up, as well as to how the explosive reacts in open water and at different depths, temperatures, and pressures.

I agree with the negative pressure theory for this reason: The shockwave was spherical emanating from the bottom of a cylinder of water. There is a moment where the force of the explosion creates pressure compressing the matter around it.  The yet uncompressed matter is temporarily drawn into the area once occupied by now compressed matter until the compression limit is reached by the expanding shockwave.  I imagine this to be like whipping a rope,  inducing a wave in rope, pulls connected units to pass energy along it. Though the rope does not physically get shorter,  the wave induced shortens its linear distance by a function of that wave.  The vacuum at the end of the cylinder is the end of the wave&#39;s rope shortening, but it will eventually whip when the energy reaches the end of the rope and carry the shockwave radii onward and outward.  To test this hypothesis, I propose a central charge in a spherical vessel, where evenly spread negative pressure would not appear as forcefully, a smaller vessel/larger charge whose shockwave would breech before the opportunity for a differential to be observed, or a pinprick in upper neck of the same cylindrical vessel through which air would be pulled in the moment of negative pressure, and expelled as the shockwave arrived.  Of further interest would be to suspend a vertical, centered &#39;necklace&#39; of compressible capsules, be vitamin E or other gel based capsules to see the effect the advancing shockwave has on each capsule as it moves through the liquid.  The capsules may even burst for different reasons from capsule ground zero to capsule at cap.

But the green bottle cap didn&#39;t allow the neck and cap to stay stationary because when the detonation caused the low pressure zone to occur, the cap (instead of staying put and allowing the bottle to move) split and allowed the pressure wave to push it away.
