Fellow scientist here (Biologist). This is exactly the type of work I have always dreamed about doing.

I&#39;m about to start a Masters program, and then a PhD program, so it may be awhile before I get to do something like what you are doing in this video, because of resources. However, videos like this give me hope.<br><br>I know a lot of people are ragging on you because of the religious aspect and, to an extent, I can relate with them. I&#39;ve had a not so great experience with the Christian religion and now consider myself an agnostic Buddhist. That being said, I don&#39;t feel there is a need to denounce your organization, and all the great work you are doing, because of that aspect. I feel as long as you encourage constructive dialogue on the topic, letting those choose how they wish to worship (or not worship), as well as promote respect for those with different views, then it should really be fine. I&#39;m sure you are fully aware of what can happen when a group is introduced to strict theology and not taught those core principles that I just mentioned. Mistreatment of others and social persecution can stem from well-meaning, but poorly planned and/or fundamentalist evangelism. I speak as a gay man who is currently witnessing this in the world and knowing there any many places I cannot go because there isn&#39;t a question as to &quot;If&quot; I will be killed but rather &quot;How and When&quot; due to religious extremism (not just of Christianity).<br><br>Well enough of my soapbox.
