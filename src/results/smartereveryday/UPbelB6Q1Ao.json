We always should be striving to get better at it, and so far the model I like is enabling the locals who wish they could do more for their community, learning from past models, seeking ensure the family can stay intact, etc. I heard from some Indian family members that in India some organizations&#39; models enabled abuse in the form of a sort of pressured conversion to Christianity. Like &quot;if you convert we will make sure you get the help you need&quot; in order to fulfill some sort of expectation from the western world for Christian converts due to the work being done. That was very concerning to hear - that so many organisations were apparently party to this abuse in India. Our expectations for what outcome we (the sponsors) want might look different in practice. <br>So, to respond to the model of this charity, Not Forgotten, if possible I&#39;d prefer the families stay together. This is complex, of course, but if say the mum (I&#39;m Aussie) is willing to have her son back home if she gets the help needed to raise him, I prefer that much more than this model. Now Not Forgotten model seems far better for the children than a standard &quot;throw the kids into a house and the staff will sort them out&quot; sort of idea. When there&#39;s abuse and abandonment things get really really tough when seeking to reunite families. There is no simple, easy solution to poverty, and so it&#39;s good to approach the issue in multifaceted ways. I appreciate the efforts of Destin and the team who are invested in this project.

He&#39;s also mentioned that he wants everyone (religious or not) watching his videos so they can learn. I&#39;m pretty sure he doesn&#39;t need you to white knight for him, especially not when you do a very poor job of it. People are allowed to be made uncomfortable by things and telling people to &#39;leave&#39; or calling them &#39;stupid&#39; for it isn&#39;t any way for a Christian to be behaving. Be an example, don&#39;t get mad because to non-believers your point of view is like riding a backward bike. Falling to name calling, aggression, and cruelty only convinces non-believers that they&#39;re right about you and that they&#39;re right about Christianity. <br><br>Those of you upset that religion is a part of this system: I understand, but keep in mind that Peru is already highly converted. Most of these children have already been raised with Catholicism as 81.3% of the country follows that particular brand of Christianity. I&#39;m not saying you should be comfortable with it, one would hope that since Destin is involved that the brand of Christianity being taught here is a good one, but I am saying that likely these kids already believe and already believe the bad things. I trust that Destin would support a system that teaches the true lessons of Jesus, and one that can help these kids unlearn bad prejudices. We know for a fact Destin is making sure these kids get a good science education, so how about we trust that he&#39;s keeping an eye out for their religious one? I wish / hope that it involves learning about other religious options, including other forms of Christianity and things like Buddhism and non-religion, mostly because when Catholicism was spread to Peru it nearly wiped out their native religion entirely. I wish / hope that these kids will be supported if they decide that religion isn&#39;t for them, because it&#39;s their choice and forcing any type of religious belief (or lack of belief) onto anyone has not historically gone well.<br><br>This is a beautiful charity, I will admit that my money is going to remain a bit more local for donations this year. No child is more important than another, but at least with more local charities I can actually physically go help them.
