And I know, living in Germany, that here with our privacy laws based on the European GDPR, many instances, in Germany for example the BSI, which is the Agency for safety in Information technology, recommends end to end encryption. A solution making this easy would sure help, as of today, you have to find individual solutions for everything.<br>But I see other problems as well. As we may have rather strict regulations in form of the GDPR, others have not (which voided two agreements on data exchange between the US and the EU, the Patriot Act based rights of the US government and thus the companies obligations did just not go together with our GDPR. For example if any of those companies stores my data on a server here in Europe, being a US company they have to give government agencies access and on order not to tell. In Europe such an access seems to have quite higher hurdles, and if it happened you have a right to know.<br>Another, even larger obstacle in my opinion is convenience. For most people it is convenient as it is. And most people are not even aware of an issue. So it takes a lot of informing, education and convincing people. As all devices of E2E encryption would be meaningless if you still have to communicate with other people unencrypted who don\u00b4t want to use it for whatever reason.<br>And if traveling, for some countries you have to be aware that using such technology would make you eligible for jail time. (Which should make anyone think  twice if they really want or have to travel to such countries.)<br>Our GDPR is a curse and a blessing at the same time. It is a blessing to have such an instrument at all. But having to handle it and all the detail most people are not even aware of can be a nightmare, as it is awfully complex and complicated. And I am sure it is by no means perfect.<br>To give some examples of the complexity, taking pictures in the public can be a problem, if you depict a single person or a small group as main part of the picture, even if the picture was made for example in a public place. From videos on YouTube I know in the US (and to some extent to be honest also in Europe) cameras at your front door, especially those smart ones like ring or nest cams are quite popular. And I absolutely see that security cameras in certain situations are a good thing. Here you have to put a warning sign on the border of your property that there is camera surveylance in place. No matter if is recorded or if you just use it to see on your phone who is at the door. If the camera then maybe shows some part of the public walkway or street, that is a no go.<br>Or for example rather &quot;innocently&quot; sharing data about another person can be an issue (like writing about certain things about a certain person on social media), especially when it comes certain fields of data regarding health/medical stuff, sexual orientation, religion,... For example I may tell someone calling our company who wants to talk to a certain colleague that the person is on sick leave. But if I would tell for example, no he is not in today, he caught a flu, that would already be to much, as &quot;harmless&quot; as this information may seem. (They simply did not want to make an extensive and still incomplete list of what might be ok, like a flu, or cold or these days corona, or possibly other things you maybe do not want everyone to know about.)<br>If something like this happens on a social media platform, on request the platform by the way then also has to make sure it gets fixed, which may be an interesting aspect when some are &quot;annoyed&quot; about platforms deleting for example comments and they see the US first amendment endangered. (While automated algorithms and the companies themself &quot;policing&quot; the content to some degree is another issue in itself, with recent laws having providers to enforce certain rules with the least amount of work for official agencies, meaning for the social media companies, on their own, not exactly helping the matter)", "comment_date": "2022-02-01T09:03:13Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "American Rifleman", "comment_text": "Please do a video on how this is going...", "comment_date": "2022-02-01T08:16:28Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Patrik W", "comment_text": "I like that you post quotes from the Bible at the end of your videos!

While I&#39;m sure many factors contribute to how one emotionally responds to novel information, my immediate reaction was to justify or defend the current data architecture. I would characterize myself as being somewhat informed about data privacy (for a layperson) and definitely in favor of stronger individual rights to protect their digital ecosystem from unwarranted and unwanted surveillance and misuse. That said, I was a bit stunned with the rationalizations I immediately came up with to defend the status quo and it really hit home how we are conditioned to view our lack of data privacy, among many topics, as a necessary evil of our modern society. In many ways, this is very much in the same realm of intrusion as secret police demanding your papers or congressional hearings asking if you or anyone you know is a communist. In those examples, we in the US have been conditioned (today) to view such acts as antithetical to democracy and freedom. With the issue of data privacy, we have been conditioned to accept the current system as the least bad alternative, whether it is to protect against terrorism, fight crime, or minimize the inconvenience of ecommerce and information transfer. I suspect that our conditioned response, or at least mine, is far from organic in its origins. Governments have always spied on their own people - see the aforementioned &quot;papers please&quot; example -  but today&#39;s version comes bundled with gigabit speed, unlimited data, and web browsing.

The one mentioned here: Is your data safe and are others allowed to do stuff with it. - The response is well the data - price is as I get free products for it.<br>2.

More of your time means more knowledge about you and more ads they can show you. So you might not find what you are searchting for but something close enough and then another and another. When you search on YouTube only the first results are your actual search the rest is things you might like (even though it was search). Studies have shown that even after following 10 suggested posts the content becomes more and more radical, because a simplistic kind of view is more attractive than a controversial. Studies claims that our current extremist political view are fostered by websites that simply wanted to bind you attention, but for that fed you more and more radical &quot;information&quot;. And now we at war inside our own country and even the president is not any more accepted by everybody but despised by half. Even if you don&#39;t go as far as this conclusion it&#39;s worth recognizing that there is no free service that really tries to 100% serve you but simply wants you to stay with them.

FB, Google,  Apple would never adopt this tech for obvious reasons,  and aside from all of us being like me and have a rack full of servers on-premises  to store and hold backups, email servers, public websites etc, all of which have their own roadblocks put in place by ISPs that want to discourage just that,  i&#39;m struggling for a way around the larger issue,  the way social media is setup for example,  it&#39;s an opt-in machine,   you either comply or you miss out on all of what has become a commodity. <br><br>P.S i&#39;m from Mobile ;)", "comment_date": "2021-10-25T03:43:54Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Travis Lundy", "comment_text": "Destin, this is fantastic!

Terrorism is the one that we all hear about most often, but there are other issues as well, such as distribution of child pornography, tracking an armed robbery gang or ransomware threat actors?  Does your privacy platform address that?  You made one incorrect statement that I wanted to point out as well.  The statement that a user can have his online accounts subpoened and would never know is not accurate.  If there is an on-going investigation then it&#39;s important that those Internet companies can&#39;t be allowed to notify their clients; however, once the suspect&#39;s are arrested, or the investigation is over and they&#39;re not charged, that information can be released.  I&#39;m sure you understand why it&#39;s important not to let the possible criminal know that they&#39;re being investigated.  Additionally, a subpoena only gets you basic subscriber information.  A search warrant is what gets investigating agencies account contents.

They remain in power and grow throughout progressive administrations of both parties.<br><br>Therefore it should be obvious to anyone paying attention that no VPN or service will defeat them.

The water has been boiling at full force for years and everyone noticed. It&#39;s just not that bad. <br><br>2) It&#39;s not like The Government (tm) is sitting there watching what everyone is doing. The risk is in a business getting hacked. It&#39;s in those business&#39; best interest to invest in security. Which is always going to be a fight driven by the hackers. <br><br>3) Even if someone gets your data, so what? There&#39;s too much data for it ever to be about YOU. It will be about sending you spam (which there are plenty of blockers for). It will be about your profile as a separate, nameless entity. Your credit card company, for example, takes on this responsibility for you. That is the shift in society that makes it all work.<br><br>4) I&#39;m all for extra protection for people that are still holding onto this illusion that privacy was ever a thing in the first place. Go nuts on this kickstarter all you want. It won&#39;t actually change anything. And it is just an illusion. You freely give out all of your precious information *all the time*. Your SSN, for example, is one of the most public things about you, yet people keep acting like it&#39;s a big secret you can&#39;t give out. <br><br>5) The whole system hinges on the data being out there. The data about how long you&#39;ve looked at some pictures isn&#39;t going to hurt you in any way. It&#39;s going to mean you get more ads that you might actually be interested in. I don&#39;t need ads for tampons, for example. But I have found modern solutions to problems I didn&#39;t know had a solution, because of targeted advertising. <br><br>6) Honestly, truly, the whole idea reeks of ego. This idea that people are watching YOU and not that you&#39;ve been reduced to a pile of digits. <br><br>Yes, we need to remain vigilant. Yes, we should pay attention to what we can pay attention to. But, no, I disagree in the original premise that there&#39;s a problem. At least a  problem that regular people need to lose any sleep over. It&#39;s in the industry&#39;s best interest to handle data safety, or they will lose us, their product. It ends up being on them to fix. <br><br>If someone steals your CC info, because of all that  data, it&#39;s very easy for the CC company to tell that those charges were not  coming from you. When companies have a data breach and you need to change your password, big deal, you have to change your password. The company&#39;s reputation takes a massive hit, they hire a better security team and immunize themselves better. <br><br>This is <b>already</b> the best solution to a &quot;problem&quot; that is way, way bigger than us. This is a natural evolution of society and it cannot be stopped. And shouldn&#39;t. If anything, it gives more and more power to the people as we become more and more &quot;the product&quot; it becomes more and more in the best interest for companies to keep us happy. <br><br>I&#39;m not saying don&#39;t be careful.

Sorry.  People happily type in and upload pictures and videos to places like Facebook all manner of things that they should have kept private.  They willingly knowingly disclose all sorts of things.  Then there are people who fill their homes with devices literally designed to listen (or even watch) every minute of every day.  By design.  People knowingly do this!  Trying to talk to people about privacy?  They don&#39;t get it.  They don&#39;t want it.  They want the world to know every detail of their lives.

We&#39;ve all had targeted ads find us that seem to read our minds. I&#39;d LOVE for you to cut open a smartphone, and settle this once and for all.

It highlights very important issues in our society, country, and the world all at once. People have become so used to giving their private information that it\u2019s commonplace, and no one stops to think about what it could mean. Most people don\u2019t care in the moment, but if they were to be targeted through these data leaks or via a direct data pull, the story would likely be different. The government is getting larger and larger every day because people aren\u2019t willing to do things themselves, and it\u2019s much easier to relegate these tasks to someone else, but that\u2019s been giving them power for years now. Unfortunately, the government is full of humans, and despite the good that humans can do, they can make mistakes and can be corrupted by power, money, or otherwise.

The site that we&#39;re all watching right now - YouTube - probably would not have existed if we were running a pay-for-play model.  Even with the financial might of Google&#39;s purchase and AdSense, it took <i>years</i> for YouTube to start turning a profit.  Of course advertising <i>can</i> exist without data collection, but its a lot less profitable to do it that way and would result in again far less interesting things on the internet.<br><br>And that&#39;s to say nothing of social media where the entire point of the platforms is to expose your information to the world.  Those who are very knowledgeable about how the platforms utilize data can make some use of such platforms minimal risk by being very careful about what they post, but most people are stuck with a dichotomy of &quot;use it and lose privacy or avoid it entirely and lose out on the &quot;social&quot; aspect of social media.<br><br>I don&#39;t have an answer for this.  I don&#39;t know that there is an answer for this.  Even if you have an app like Signal that is developed and distributed for free, somebody has to host the servers to connect you to your buddy - they might not be able to read your data due to the encryption, but it still has to go through their system in order to correctly route it to the recipient.<br><br>Signal itself runs off of donations.  That&#39;s great and all but it doesn&#39;t really scale for the same reason direct-pay apps don&#39;t scale - there is only so much people can (or at least are willing) to donate.  A few specific apps?  Sure.  But you can&#39;t run an entire internet that way.<br><br>Anyway, I&#39;m not trying to claim your effort is useless by any means.  Increasing privacy for those who want it is a good thing.  But the idea of a completely private internet is not really plausible unless we can come up with something else that is both valuable enough to provide revenue for a business and infinitely copyable like data is.", "comment_date": "2021-10-23T05:49:55Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "chickensaltchips", "comment_text": "Wait, so you&#39;re suggesting we just update the current system and <b>not</b> utilize web3 &amp; blockchain?

So you can not encrypt it and you have to play the game that the platform provider set up for you.If you can only use the platform by e.g. also giving you actual location, you will do it even if it was a dumb idea (people know meanwhile that Facebook gathers data it should not be gathering but they still use Facebook). This will not change. So what is the benefit of securing your data on one end if you give it away for free on the other end?<br><br>2nd: Even if you encrypt all your data via an app, the app itself has to run on a operating system. This system can still spy on you before your app encrypts the data. Also, the app will not encrypt data that the operating system is collecting and sending out by itself. The app will also not be able to keep other parties (like government, device provider, etc.) peeking into the data that is stored on your device. To do so, you would have to use/build an open source operating system which you would have to maintain yourself. On one hand, close to all of the people are unable to maintain such an operating system (knowledge wise or time wise), on the other hand, companies like Microsoft and Apple will never (!!!) make their operating systems open source.<br><br>I do understand the worries that make SmarterEveryDay want to build their own privacy app, but working in this field myself (I am an IT consultant and project manager), I doubt that the app will make your privacy any better than it is today (there are already a lot of solution out there the encrypt you data and defend your privacy - and still your data is open to whoever is paying enough money or has enough power (e.g. government)). I will have a look at the kickstarter - just for fun - but my expectations are that the app will not be capable of really securing your privacy or will never be finished or will go the same way that other apps already go (and therefor not making your situation any better). <br><br>Greetings from Switzerland \ud83c\udde8\ud83c\udded", "comment_date": "2021-10-23T05:08:13Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "MrOthon25", "comment_text": "I&#39;m a Software Engineer and I would like to collaborate in any way I could.

After all, simply buying something off of a website gives that company enough information to target you for future ads. Thus why your ads might change even after simply visiting a particular site. <br><br>And after all, targeted advertising still does SEEM to be preferred to untargeted, because otherwise the value of advertising drops way down, and everybody gets the same trashy ads.

The government can crack anything.  I would not be surprised if some of the cryptocurrencies are just a way to outsource this decryption for free by some countries.  And this will be easier and faster when they get better quantum computing.  It was decades ago, but a friend that was working on encryption told me that there is a legal limit to the bit level of encryption...because the government wants to be able to break encryption quickly with their computers.<br>The main issue I have with the removal of privacy is the intellectual property.  Someone can easily steal an idea or share it with someone who will.  Somehow we have to protect against this.<br>I think email needs protection. Whatever laws protect snail mail should protect email. I am okay with a warrant, but they should have to tell you they did it, just like you have to be served a warrant in the physical situation.  They are serving it to the wrong entity when they go to the email companies.  It is like getting permission to enter a home from the maid when you are not there, rather than the owners. Am I willing to potentially allow another 9/11?  That is a tough call.  I obviously want them to catch people before they get that far. <br>Yet, I remember when people would say how horrible people had it in other countries because the government would read the mail and there would be people watching people clandestinely all the time.  Those countries could only dream of the surveillance state we now have due to computers.<br>My small pushback idea is to require a deletion of Internet data after 3 years that was not intentionally placed by the user.  Actual purchase history is okay.  The mouse hover time, page history and other nonsense needs deleted.  And users should be able to easily delete the purchase history too, if the return time limit is up (and selectively).  Same thing with surveillance video.  It has to be deleted/destroyed, or charges brought if there was some crime observed. Unless the suspected crime is murder, rape/child molesting, espionage, or fraud/theft in the hundreds of thousands of dollars or more, or amounts over $1,000  if elderly people/children/mentally disabled were defrauded...and there are good reasons that one of these crimes is suspected.

More than just &quot;personalized advertising&quot; we have to understand that this data, this digital copy of you, tracking where you are at all times, conceptually, at some point in the future, even predicting your behavior, it&#39;s not just valuable because it can show you some underwear ad you&#39;ll skip over. It&#39;s valuable because it can control you. If you can predict someone&#39;s behavior, you control that person. I wouldn&#39;t be surprised if many of the common complaints about misinformation circulating on these services are entirely intentional on the part of the algorithms simply doing their job.<br><br>Now, this isn&#39;t to say that being able to predict someone&#39;s behavior, that having this control over people, is even necessarily a bad thing. Conceivably, you might even use such a system to, say, educate massive amounts of people on some issue they knew little about (wow, what a shocker), to be able to change their minds more effectively. It&#39;s not even like you can say they didn&#39;t really have any control over whether or not their minds were changed, you can&#39;t say their free will was violated, because it&#39;s questionable that if such a thing can exist, that they had any in the first place.<br><br>Even having ownership over an idea, even if you&#39;ve produced it, is a strange and perhaps incredibly damaging extension of regular property rights, which are already somewhat questionable in the first place. I mean, perhaps data could be seen more as labor, or less of an idea, and more just your day to day actions, it&#39;s dubious to define it any one way. Knowing whether or not someone&#39;s gone to the store, knowing their schedule, it&#39;s not inherently immoral, it&#39;s just creepy because it facilitates worse actions and abuses. In my mind the problem here isn&#39;t that this data is being held, even, but that I have no control over what anyone decides to do with it. You&#39;ve correctly identified the problem, <b>they</b> (Big tech corporations) have control over our (the user&#39;s) data. But the tendency to hyper-exaggerate individual agency and free will isn&#39;t necessarily ideal either, that&#39;s a step in the totally opposite direction. Everyone sharing their metadata not only shows us what your own personal schedule looks like, it has the possibility to revolutionize the field of sociology. Now, instead of having to do a study on whether or not people get discriminated against or oppressed, or whatever, whether or not someone has control over their own lives, what strange common factors might be at play, I can directly know the answers to all of these questions.

Pretty much everyone in the USA, Canada, etc use google in some form or another. Of course it happens often, Gmail alone has around 1.5 billion active users alone, not counting any other service attached to google itself.  Not saying your message is wrong because I agree laws need to change and privacy is important just... that comment hovers on the edge of being needlessly fear inducing (not &quot;mongering&quot; because I don&#39;t think your doing it on purpose).<br><br>Even more so in conjunction with the comment about how the land is owned by the government, it gave me big conspiracy theory video vibes (flat earthier, etc) not saying there isn&#39;t something there but with you just mentioning &quot;well not sure what that means I just wanted you to KNOW&quot; then leaving it at that... it kinda tries to induce fear. There might be something there that&#39;s sinister ... or there could be a dozen other things going on such as the transfer of the land hasn&#39;t gone through yet OR that fact that it might be a facility that houses government or government related info. People will naturally be compelled to think the worse.<br><br>Or the comment about how the government can request your personal info without any oversight, which isn&#39;t totally true. To get a subpoena the government/police/etc has to show a judge that the information they are requesting is pertinent to a ongoing investigation and the information would help the case. There is oversight there and this HAS been abused and might need MORE oversight. But needing more oversight doesn&#39;t mean there isn&#39;t ANY oversight.<br><br>The comment that they can do it without your knowledge isn&#39;t totally true either, In particular Reddit and Google will actually notify you if your info has been subpoenaed and will even inform you that you have X amount of days (usually 7) to file a motion to squash the subpoena before they will have to comply with it because they have to notify you by law because you have a right to try to squash the subpoena. Can agencies get a subpoena for info and Google/Reddit/ etc wont notify you? Yes... but that&#39;s mostly found in the extreme cases (terrorism and such).<br><br>Then you show us this app you have a vested interest in which you ask us to enter all our private info.... which you mentioned was one of the starts of this whole issue back when social media came out (entering our private info into a system). I love your channel and you have a great message but the way this video played out just comes off wrong.<br><br>Whats the point of entering all my private info into this app? I know you call it a &quot;proof of concept&quot; but the kickstarter make it seem like its more than that. I noticed a picture on the kickstarter says you can enter your passport. Why? There is not point to do that because no one would accept a phone picture as a official document. Now we are just entering our even MORE important info onto the internet because that&#39;s what this does, secure or not it still GOES on the internet for really no reason unless the info is just stored locally, in which case.... there&#39;s even less point to the app in my eyes.<br><br>I think you need a whole video talking about this app and explaining what it is and does. Because right now your just asking us to do something which it felt like you just spent 15 minutes telling us to be careful of doing.

I was just having a conversation with my wife about digital privacy, and how things like SSN and Passports are going to be replaced by tokenized versions on a blockchain. I&#39;m still new to learning about blockchain, but my basic understanding is that you could theoretically store an encrypted version of all your data on a blockchain, and then provide tokenized access to those who need some piece of your information, such as for an employment or apartment application. Ideally, the SSN, for example, would never be viewable by the employer or landlord, because their systems can&#39;t be 100% secure, but the tokenized version would be recognized by the credit check agency.

Even if all of this works, the tech industries we\u2019re targeting like Facebook depend on owning our information to keep running. Our information is the product they sell as a company. So going back to your engine analogy, you\u2019re not replacing the engine, you\u2019re just taking it out. What will the internet run on if not our data? My guess is that they\u2019ll have to start charging to provide those same services. Will people be willing to pay for a Facebook account? I don\u2019t know. And perhaps the best argument would be that people should have the option to either sell their data or pay for an otherwise free service. That\u2019s really what it\u2019s going to come down to, and that applies to using the Internet in any capacity. Privacy will simply be another service one pays for, although it\u2019s kind of sad that privacy is now a service and not a right, although in a capitalist society, there\u2019s an argument to be made that everything is a service and nothing is a right. One of the bugs in the system I guess. <br><br>Anyway this is a fascinating topic and privacy does come at a cost assuming it\u2019s even possible in today\u2019s day and age. I\u2019ve always assumed I\u2019d be fine because A) there\u2019s anonymity in numbers, making use of that much data is pretty challenging, that\u2019s what AI and the study of big data is trying to figure out and B) I don\u2019t really have anything to hide. Obviously terrorism will be easier the more privacy we have and it will be more difficult to solve crimes and to uncover abusive relationships with partners and children etc.. But losing our privacy also comes at a cost too. The psychological toll of always being watched and never having a private space will be devastating, the government will overreach, people will be taken advantage of, and as of right now, we aren\u2019t using that data for anything useful. All we us it for is figuring out how to sell as many things to people as possible. Clearly there\u2019s some issues with both sides. And privacy vs safety has always been a difficult discussion. We\u2019ve always leaned towards protecting privacy, especially from tyrannical leadership, and yes, having ownership of other\u2019s privacy is a very totalitarian thing because it works wonders on people\u2019s psychology when you want them to fear you. So it\u2019s all a really difficult topic. <br><br>Putting all of that aside. I think we need more options, so I\u2019m glad Destin is doing this. It\u2019s not really going to solve any of the other major issues plaguing social media and our interconnectedness and the fact that we have access to more free speech than ever before, but it\u2019ll give us options and it gets us talking about things.", "comment_date": "2021-10-22T06:59:19Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Michael", "comment_text": "This is so wonderful.

When you pay for your purchase with a credit or debit card, they  permanently STORE your card information in their computer.  This is NOT needed and highly suspicious.   Your card information is only need for a few seconds -- long enough to process the transaction electronically (in those few seconds the card is verified and the money is instantly deposited into the stores bank account), after which they have no use for it.  The entire transaction is finished.  If they have you sign the receipt (or do it on a little screen), that document goes nowhere.  The store will keep it for about 30 days in case there&#39;s a problem (like you later deny making the purchase), then they simply throw it away.  You may have noticed that in little stores and restaurants they swipe your card in a little box on the counter and enter the charge manually, this transaction also happens instantly but those little boxes (most) don&#39;t store the card information (they have no memory and aren&#39;t connected to a computer -- they communicate with the merchant system directly via a network or phone connection).  Those merchants always get their money (instantly) and there is no problem.  Big stores with computerized point-of-sale (POS) systems are flagrantly violating and risking your privacy by storing your card data on their system.  I don&#39;t even know why they do it, other than they can.  They can&#39;t enter another charge without your permission, and if you come back for a refund they can simply swipe your card again.  Several years ago I made a small purchase at Target.  A week later I got a letter from Target Stores informing me that their system had been hacked and my credit card information was stolen.  I had to cancel my card, order a new one, update all my autopay accounts (Netflix, Hulu, AT&amp;T, Paramount+, Showtime, and many more).  This theft could not have happened if those %&amp;^$! hadn&#39;t stored my information to begin with.  I&#39;m somewhat shocked that this has never been addressed -- and STOPPED!  Every major retailer -- including virtually ALL online businesses store credit card data despite the obvious risks and total lack of benefit.  We should all call our congressmen and demand legislation to prohibit storing credit card information after any one-time purchase.  Obviously subscription services need to keep your card data so they can charge your card every month, but even then if you cancel the subscription you credit card information should be completely destroyed and not saved ANYWHERE in their system -- not even the backups.  Millions of credit card numbers have been stolen from these retailers -- who have varying success at cyber security.  Again, they have no need to save credit card information, it&#39;s literally useless to them 10 seconds after the sale.  This is a gigantic serious problem that EVERYONE needs to care about.  If retailers had not been storing credit card information, the only way credit card numbers could be stolen is if banks got hacked -- which is pretty rare.  Everybody should be bitching about this because it&#39;s unfair, uncalled for and a grievous violation of our privacy.

Not just a little, but 100%, completely gone. My turn to convince YOU, the opposite of your argument:<br>We are quickly approaching a level of technology where a single individual with modest means and a grudge could pose an existential threat to the entire species. We may be there now. Where a single individual could produce, in a small private lab, modified viruses. For the cost of a home, someone could purchase most of the equipment necessary to do this. They&#39;d simply need the knowledge and every day new students are being educated in it. Imagine if someone produced several viruses. Viruses based on past deadly viruses. Probably wouldn&#39;t be too hard to find a few Spanish flu in some cemeteries in the Siberian permafrost. So there&#39;s a nice little starter virus to get you going. Maybe find some smallpox victims, since nobody&#39;s getting vaccinated against smallpox. Those of us in our 50s are among the last to be vaccinated against it. And then modify them. A little genetic engineering and you can make them even more deadly. <br>My point is, that this is a pretty feasible scenario and becomes increasingly so as time goes on. Put your viruses in some spritzers, and take a few international flights around the world, spraying planes and airports as you go and you suddenly have a pandemic in a matter of days.<br>What we need is technological telepathy. The ability for us to read each other&#39;s minds, obviously via technology, since we don&#39;t have the natural ability. It&#39;s the only way I can think of to really ensure that a single individual doesn&#39;t wipe out the species.<br>And don&#39;t tell me about colonizing Mars. or something. We can&#39;t even keep a 8 people alive in a desert for a year without cheating. You think taking away the atmosphere and dropping the temperature 100 degrees is going to improve the odds?

First, with these apps you can only communicate with other people who have the app.  Second, the monetization of privacy apps brings about a big barrier on app adoption rates.  You have to make money with this app, so I&#39;m assuming you will have to pay monthly for the apps service.  This already puts the app way behind other free services.  <br><br>I think people generally understand that they are exchanging their data for convenience when using big tech apps.

What&#39;s crazy is, if you are the frog and realize you are the frog and start to point out to the other frogs that you can see the temperature gauge going up, its a tricky gauntlet of opposing belief systems faced which in some cases have me/some of us rather keep quiet against the status quo  - which in compliments to you, require a smart way to inform and transmit data and knowledge to enhance the awareness of all our different ranges like you are doing with this video.<br><br> Secondly, if I may :) A scary angle for me, on the point of how our metadata alone may not seem useful but how it is aggregated to form a view of how you put it, who we are. I would argue a component to it which from my career in data fields, may be even a scarier reality. What our data contains relative to what it shows - is influenced by the observer. Our digital footprint profiling, to group and cluster data points to summarize us and our data movement - in my opinion, depends on the intentions and methods of that aggregation and manipulation. It&#39;s a very subjective field to summarize, but I think at least for me personally, that&#39;s what concerns me equally, is not just what is captured but what is done with it after. One day, if not already, AI will have digested every bit of digital data on the internet, and how it would summarize it all, and us... That concerns me, but again, not something you can talk about out loud as its out there not here and now. <br><br>Crazy side angle is - those people who probably should have their data viewed for national security purposes, are the ones who know/find a way to keep it hidden, legally or not is another discussion - akin to the worst criminals in the world, may or may not already be in jail - the best worst, are likely still uncaught or smartly hidden in plain sight... <br><br>Fun side note perhaps, I had a thought a few times to write a letter to AI. To explain myself and my being and my existence and my awareness and my concerns of things we as a species do... So that maybe, just that one extra piece of data digested, might sway the judgement of AI from the myriad of garbage we all in some way contribute to one way or another at some point in our lives. Especially if we consider how AI is so badly portrayed in movies in some cases, just to think if AI watches and comprehends our representation of AI and aligns to it.... we really could be the architects of our own demise!

And &quot;have access&quot; is a stretch, considering there are different vectors of attacks, different ways of access and in many cases an AS simply cannot provide the data in questions. And let&#39;s not forget that there&#39;s a difference between metadata and data analytics, which are collected differently. You can have no accounts in any of the big tech companies and ad agencies will STILL have de-anonymizable data with geolocations, browser info, cross links and more. <br>And don&#39;t forget that between your government and hackers there are also other governments, which would like info on you (may be not you specifically, but someone). More than that, there&#39;s a big bulk of data collected via cameras, subway passes, banks and much more, which you can&#39;t combat easily.<br><br>Another point for the video: there&#39;s a big difference between p2p encryption and general encryption, but there&#39;s more problems there: encryption is a tricky field to work in and my country, for instance, places harsh laws upon it. You have to be certified and higher risk places like banks or government places, MUST use specific encryption protocols, which have already been called into question. It was noted that the tables created for them are far from random and it probably has a backdoor. <br><br>And more than that -- It wasn&#39;t &quot;slow&quot;. GDPR, 152-FL, USA privacy laws -- they all cropped up BECAUSE of the increased risk of cyber attacks.

Third party cookies still have no solution, global data protection laws are at a failing point both internationally and locally and moreover -- because of the way the internet runs these days privacy is a direct conflict of interest for most tech giants, who rely on data. I&#39;d like to see a solution and I love that there are positive steps taken towards privacy in general, but as of right now, I see that privacy is dead.

Even if to implement this scenario, we the current people of this current era should give up on our pleasant daily life, I think we should do so. Just because we haven&#39;t yet reached a point in time, where we are forced to make changes involuntarily, it is nothing new from history that people go through tough times, so that the generations after them profit from those struggles.<br><br>Just as I am guilty of ignorance, and don&#39;t have the solutions to represent these changes, I think we should consider the fact that just as our views have continued to change, it is time for our infrastructure that was built by ancestors who have failed in some manner, to now represent our current time?<br><br>Instead of saying we are too reliant on that foundation, we should tear it down, even if it would cause unpleasant changes to begin with. As long as we are willing to endure to see the better things that could come from those struggles.<br><br>I write this, not from a perspective of religion, or fate, but to accept our comfort from being vulnerable. Just as we, as humans from young age seek comfort, and allow ourselves to be vulnerable with our parents, would it be wrong to put a little trust in those that govern our society, even as adults?

If everyone&#39;s data was locked up and no one could see or use it then there goes the free internet. Like you say the fuel for the engine is data, so what happens when there&#39;s no fuel? Are we going to pay for it? Probably not, because not everyone can afford it, so the cost would be high. YouTube for instance is used around the world as a teaching tool to lots of underprivileged kids, should that be stopped? Google provides the world&#39;s knowledge at the fingertips of anyone that wants it, should that stop? It allows those under oppressive regimes to get the word out about their situation, do you want to cut them off? Something needs to be done but it&#39;s not as simple as turning off the personal data flow from users. If your product worked, the companies would just change their user agreements to request permission to use the data and if it&#39;s not given, you don&#39;t get to use it without paying, which is actually reasonable.

However, I&#39;m hoping that in this series, you explain how bigtech will be incentivized, to overhaul the entire industry. I love comparing the sharing of personal data to polution. But I&#39;m 47, and I have very fond memories of the giant cars that looked more like boats. They averaged about 8 mpg, and everything about them was bad for the environment. I miss those ugly monsters terribly, but I admit, that concept wasn&#39;t sustainable. My point is that it&#39;s difficult to get people to realize we need a new engine. This engine is all we know, and it makes driving comfortable. It&#39;s all we know. But it&#39;s even more difficult to transform an entire industry. Competition and complex government regulations and incentives are just a few things that have pushed car manufacturers into making cars that pollute less. But let&#39;s face it, they still cause pollution. (There&#39;s a lot of pollution in the manufacturing of electric cars, not to mention the pollution created in making the electricity to power them.) I&#39;m interested in how much would this new engine will reduce the sharing of private data, and how the industry will be convinced to change the engine. Exchanging private data is worth 100&#39;s of billions of dollars. No one is going to give up that kind of money without replacing it.

Part of the issue is that the internet has never been funded... it ended up relying on advertising (which ironically is what allows this video to be posted and shared for free).   The drive for better advertising is what has been the underlying motivator for &quot;Big tek&quot; to gather more and better information. &quot;You are the product&quot; means you are what sells to pay for the services you now take forgranted.  If that dries up (or degrades), so do the advertising budgets that fund those services.
