Consider sending it along to someone who loves music/art/math/computers/Blender.  OScilloscope Music blew my mind when I first saw it.   hope you enjoy this video half as much as I enjoyed making it. Jerobeam and Hansi are super intelligent guys and I learned quite a bit from them.  I&#39;m considering dropping another video from my visit with them.  Supporting their arty by buying OsciStudio from Hansi and music from Jerobeam would be pretty awesome.

A signal drives two actuators that steer a beam and draws a pattern, combined with the blanking of the signal at certain moments. Repeating this fast enough and it will draw you an animation. I\u2019ve been playing a hit with such lasers and the thing is that the physical actuators (the stepper motors with the mirrors attached) are a limiting factor because they physically need to move from point a to point b. The more complex an animation becomes, the more visible this is (for example) at corners of objects. On this scope the picture is drawn without the use of physical moving objects/mirrors and therefor I guess these very complex Tetris animations with razor sharp corners are possible. <br><br>I guess that you could translate the laser projector files into audio and you would end up with similar music. Nevertheless, very cool and fun to watch such retro equipment bring used like this. \ud83e\udd1f\ud83c\udffb", "comment_date": "2022-07-02T11:24:32Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Kosmos elektronik", "comment_text": "\u041a\u0420\u0423\u0422\u042b\u0415 \u0420\u0415\u0411\u042f\u0422\u0410 5+", "comment_date": "2022-07-02T10:54:16Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Kosmos elektronik", "comment_text": "\u0410 \u0413\u0414\u0415 \u0413\u0420\u0418\u0411\u042b", "comment_date": "2022-07-02T10:50:17Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "\u0425\u043e\u043c\u044f\u043a \u043f\u0440\u043e\u0433\u0440\u0430\u043c\u043c\u0438\u0441\u0442", "comment_text": "Demo on oscilloscope... its interesting", "comment_date": "2022-07-02T10:20:36Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "HMC Music production", "comment_text": "that&#39;s a lot of free time i guess \ud83d\ude05\ud83d\ude05", "comment_date": "2022-07-01T15:23:12Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Trainlover", "comment_text": "That is so cool also I like that music it sounds cool", "comment_date": "2022-07-01T14:10:06Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Screen Protectors", "comment_text": "Nonsense", "comment_date": "2022-07-01T12:42:41Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Birder O\u2019 murder", "comment_text": "Well I have a new thing to be worryingly obsessed with thanks", "comment_date": "2022-07-01T12:19:29Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Spark", "comment_text": "Holy...I just got the most real flashback to 80s and 90s raves from hacker culture", "comment_date": "2022-07-01T11:47:22Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Memeticos", "comment_text": "matrix be like", "comment_date": "2022-07-01T11:40:49Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "BILLY HENDRIX", "comment_text": "Tornadosaurus rex", "comment_date": "2022-07-01T11:07:17Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Schockmetamorphose", "comment_text": "Is this in any way related to the trick, where a laser is pointing at a mirror on a membrane wich gets blasted with music?", "comment_date": "2022-07-01T09:18:22Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "lowlowlow ok", "comment_text": "watch: quake on oscilloscope", "comment_date": "2022-07-01T08:41:16Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "RKool", "comment_text": "digital oscilloscopes exist", "comment_date": "2022-07-01T08:22:49Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Tony R", "comment_text": "There is another person that created with sound...

I&#39;m also a musician who was lucky enough to get about 10 hours with a mini-moog in the mid-1970s and began to understand the relationship between what you see on the oscilloscope and music. Recently I was looking for efficient FFT algorithms for some neopixel LED animations I am experimenting with. My research caused YouTube&#39;s suggestion algorithm to recommend a number of videos 1b1b&#39;s FFT explainer. Then I saw this and thought &quot;hmm, that sounds cool.&quot; Cool is an understatement. This is simply amazing. I am going to check out their website and find ways to support their music. I do maker hacking for fun and often mix analog and digital concepts. This has generated a dozen ideas within minutes after watching. I am going to share this broadly!!! Thank you sir.

Compared to seeing (gathering visual data) the data resolution one could read out via hearing would of course be limited (missing one whole dimension and essentially being monochromatic). <br>Now, I really wonder if one could train a brain (or machine for that matter) to get a sense of its surrounding this way. If it could it could be a kind of glasses for the blind. Bending the light/information in a way so that a nervous system with a more limited range of input could be &quot;made to see&quot; like this.<br>Now, I really really wonder if, if the first two cases worked, if you could improve healthy perception like this too. Could you, for example, introduce new ranges of say, the electromagnetic spectrum to our perceptive apparatus? Say, &quot;hearing&quot; if something emitted certain wavelengths beyond the visual spectrum.

I understand what they are doing and consider it some pretty simple stuff, but several things put together in a very sophisticated way.  I never went as far to change update rates to get musical effects with a clock rate just under 1 MHz... YES! ONE MEGAHERTZ clock.<br> The system I used was really stretched in processor time to do real-time rotations, scaling and motions of multiple images at once for choreography to recorded music.<br>..<br>Makes me wish I hadn&#39;t sold my primary development system to someone who hasn&#39;t done anything with it yet... but time marches on and life has it priorities...<br>....<br>Also, one of my best features was what I called my circle generator like the one shown at 12 minutes.  By allowing the operator to put in any &quot;crazy&quot; numbers for the horizontal and vertical frequency and size steps you  can get some of the most complex figures that look NOTHING like the common Lissajous patterns.  Some of the patterns were logical given sine and cosine, but others were most certainly caused by the limitations on the trig algorithm in the software&#39;s math package. <br>Stepping the sine and cosine correctly you can not only get any polygon, but five pointed stars and. in fact, any number of star-points you wish.  Entering crazy numbers yielded some of the most interesting pseudo-animation image motions.  I have a Laser projector running a ROM that I bring out on Halloween that has a 13 minute show of my best &quot;circle Generator&quot; images/pseudo-animations.<br>..<br>I started to add key frame animation (the computer does the Tweening for you) , but things were changing in life and I had to do the research to figure out how to do it, but had to write the book I needed to know how to do it (Piecewise Polynomial Interpolation Fundamentals)<br>..<br><br>Also. I&#39;ve seen YouTube videos of systems that produced relatively normal sounding music, but  with O-Scope mages virtually hidden in it and not affecting the music that I could hear; which was quite impressive.

I don&#39;t recall the Cromemco as having a hard drive, but it did have two 5-1/4&quot; floppy drives and the thing ran on BASIC.  Anyhow, one of the post-docs and I became buds.  During down times in the lab he taught me to use BASIC.  At some point he connected the Cromemco to the oscilloscope and showed me how to use trig functions with BASIC-controlled sequential variables to make interesting patterns on the &#39;scope.  Obviously, making squiggles on the &#39;scope wasn&#39;t the focus of our work there, but it did help with my basic BASIC programming as well as my appreciation of trig.", "comment_date": "2019-09-02T01:09:52Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Katie Golder", "comment_text": "When he tapped the left one it made noise in my right ear (I am wearing headphones) and vice versa", "comment_date": "2019-09-02T01:06:09Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "jimmyturpin", "comment_text": "I wonder what they could do with a little time with a Kinect output?

I connected outputs from a stereo to the yoke--one audio channel drove the horizontal beam sweep, and the other audio channel drove the vertical beam sweep. It was very cool to listen to the radio while watching that. The beam was (of course) in perfect sync with the audio, so a bass beat would jump all over the screen and a speaking voice put a circular pattern in the center that looked something like a mouth. It reminded me of an old part of the Captain Kangaroo show where he had a talking character (I cannot remember that character&#39;s name--it was over 50 years ago!) that was a Lisajous pattern on a TV screen. It was a lot of fun and easy and cheap to do.

Typical audio is 1 dimensional, with left (-X&gt;0) and right (0&lt;X), but what if you broke this out into surround sound, or a plane, with back (-Y&gt;0) and front (0&lt;Y)? Take it a step further with newer 3d audio technology and have down (-Z&gt;0) and up (0&lt;Z). <br><br><br><br><br>Of course, all of this gets very, very messy with higher dimensions. Such as 2d audio needing 4 scope inputs, meaning 4 mathematical dimensions; 3d would require 6. Basically Y=X*2.<br>It gets even messier when you factor in that they&#39;re using a 3d model to produce a 2d scene to produce a 1d audio source. But how would this work for higher audio dimensions? Is a singular dimension tacked onto the end all that is needed, Z=Y+1? 5d model&gt;4d scene&gt;2d audio, 7d model&gt;6d scene&gt;3d audio? Or does each pair of dimensions need an additional dimension added to it, Z=Y+X or Z=3X? 6d model&gt;4d scene&gt;2d audio, 9d model&gt;6d scene&gt;3d audio?<br><br><br>I&#39;m not even sure if Blender can handle higher dimensions, not that anyone could actually comprehend the higher dimensional polyhedra, like a 5d cube, let alone a 9d cube. <br>Their own program&#39;s side of things would be easier, though, as the original is taking a 2d scene and translating it to 2 inputs the scope can produce an image with, X/Y &gt; inputs 1/2, all it would need to do is expand for more mathematical dimensions and inputs, X/Y\\Z/A\\B/C &gt; inputs 1/2\\3/4\\5/6. Of course, following this scheme would require three independent scopes to make it function correctly on the scope side of things. Not that the physical scopes are relevant at this point, just the scene to input translation is.<br>Then assuming Blender, or another program, can actually do higher dimensions, producing a picture should be fairly easy to do also, as we do have 2d interpretations of hypercubes by going from 4d to 3d slices to 2d slices. It would just take more work for higher dimensions. This final picture would be the display art side of things. <br><br><br>Though, with 3d tech, we could skip the last 2d slice step in certain use cases. Either with 3d glasses, newer trickery by using a glass pyramid to reflect multiple images into a single &#39;hologram&#39;, or with newer tech like the Looking Glass display.

Come to think of it, that&#39;s also where I got the TV. Anyway, each channel was driven by a separate 12-bit DAC (digital to analog converter) built on a prototype board in an Apple ][ microcomputer. Essentially it was a primitive oscilloscope, only using electromagnetic deflection, not electrostatic (as true oscilloscope tubes do.) <br><br>The DACs were controlled by a simple assembler-language routine that continually dumped the contents of two data tables to the DACs (one for the X axis, the other for the Y) as fast as possible, and would slowly shift the phase relationship between the two tables to generate dynamic Lissajous figures. The nifty thing was that I wasn&#39;t limited to a few simple waveforms from a function generator, we had a lot of fun using Apple Floating Point BASIC programs to poke all sorts of interesting data to the display.", "comment_date": "2019-09-01T07:19:12Z", "likes_count": 2}, {"comment_by": "thishadowithin", "comment_text": "First, of all I LOVE KEYGEN MUSIC!

My boss was one of, if not the inventor of the Laser Light Rock show. When he started out he had to do the math on paper and program cast-off IBM computers with punchcards to do this (this is back in the 70s).  The point is, the output goals were pretty much the same - pure X/Y coordinate data over time. These are parallel disciplines that use very similar techniques.<br>In the early 90s I used to hand draw line-art animations, frame by frame, and the software I used would output the X/Y data to a laser projector, which used 2 servos with mirrors (one for X and one for Y) to draw the animation with the laser.  The interesting thing is that if you got your ear close to the servos, you could hear the sound of drawing being generated by the servos in the same way the oscilloscope is doing.<br>What I&#39;m particularly intrigued by is that you should be able to work backwards from those laser-shows to generate music from their data.  You could also do this with any old vector graphic video games, like asteroids or star-wars, and hear what they sounded like being played. In fact I once played a game of asteroids, with a laser projector, on the side of the Nations Bank building in downtown Dallas, doing just that.

For the masses such as myself who are &quot;missing the connections&quot; for retaining information by rote memorization, it was a nightmare. I recall that in my basic Trig. class, the ONLY test I aced was the one in which the concepts were DIRECTLY used in the applications of surveyors (those who use trig. to &quot;plot on a map&quot; the specifics of land ownership, etc.)...EVERYTHING else I strugged through because I had absoutely no frame of reference for application &quot;in the real world&quot; at all. Such applications as an oscilloscope would have made all the difference in the world to me. My studies would have been less &quot;info parroting&quot; and more &quot;knowledge understanding&quot; which would have allowed me to retain the material beyond the upcoming examination. Such a shame...such a waste...such a number of opportunities lost. I can only hope such &quot;real world&quot; applications are presented in the classrooms of today that will make the difference in students&#39; learning.

When you swirl water with a spoon or anything like that, the internal whirlpool pulses. I have come to 2 possible theories with my genius friends. 1) they believe its a problem of superposition (the way waves interact with each other) and that as it moves back and forth, the difference in wave height crossing an area causes a difference in height at the middle. 2) my theory is based in centrifugal forces. As objects rotate about a focal point, they actually push perpendicular to the radius and an external force pushes them to stay in a circular pattern. The rotation of the water causes friction which slows the water. Water being a fluid would fill the whirlpool, and when the mass of a rotating object moves toward the focal point, it spins faster, forcing the water to push back out, creating a pulse effect.<br><br>My thought to test it is to use 2 identical motors spinning at different speeds in identical water amounts and identical glasses. If you measure the height of change in the whirlpool, then the equivalent amount of change would mean its based on the friction, a different amount of change could mean that the speed of the waves would make superposition the answer.", "comment_date": "2019-09-01T02:56:40Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Jonathan Van Maanen", "comment_text": "4000 views in 8 minutes", "comment_date": "2019-09-01T02:56:37Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Mehrdad G.", "comment_text": "Now that\u2019s a vintage Tektronix scope...
