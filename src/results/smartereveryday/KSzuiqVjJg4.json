I think it would be possible to fake the launches, and I think that the actual number of people that are aware of them being faked may be relatively small.<br>         Are you aware that it was this very same astronaut that is shown in this video who made the admission that &quot;we are now only able to go into low earth orbit (essentially orbits of less than 500 miles up - with most being around 300 miles up)&quot;, he went on to say words to the effect that &quot;we used to have the technology to go to the moon but we no longer have it - that technology was lost (or misplaced) somehow&quot;.   Pluton Master, would you agree that if this astronaut actually said this statement that it would be a totally laughable and completely ridiculous explanation for why we cannot go to the moon anymore?   I will assume that you have enough sense to agree that such a statement would be an absolutely absurd explanation, and yet this guy made the above statement.<br>            You claimed that I am gullible because I  &quot;... go on the internet and trust some random people who think that the government has been trying to keep a secret for decades thats not psychologically possible...&quot;     I don&#39;t know why you would write, &quot;psychologically possible&quot;, because it seems that just about anything is &quot;psychologically possible&quot;.<br>[Didn&#39;t you notice how the entire world was lulled into the erroneous belief that commercial airliners could bring down 2 skyscrapers, making them dissolve into clouds of dust and then disappear, with whatever was left falling perfectly into their own footprints like some miraculous occurrence just by chance (the buildings didn&#39;t fall over asymmetrically but rather they fell straight downward in such a way that you could not ask for a more perfect demolition).   Had this miraculous demolition occurred just once, it would have been uncanny... but it happened back to back... with each piece cut the perfect length to be loaded onto a flatbed and hauled off to the dump, and then later that day a 3rd building fell down essentially the same way even though no plane hit it - it fell just because... in fact it fell some 30 minutes after the BBC mistakenly reported it&#39;s collapse.   Then you have the plane that supposedly hit the pentagon when it is obvious that no commercial airliner crashed there - this is what the first reporters on the scene said.  Then we have that dirt pit in Shanksville, PA where they claim another full sized airliner buried itself far into the ground and vaporized, but anyone with eyes can see no plane had crashed there.    Well the world sure fell for the lies told on 9/11 didn&#39;t they?<br>Then we have that tragic day in Dallas when our beloved Commander in Chief was cut down right before our eyes in what was a horrific event that was so clearly not possibly done by one person from the Texas School Book Depository.   It is obvious that the shot came from the right side of the car.   Just as the doctor at the press conference that day held his forefinger up to his own right temple to describe the shot coming in from the right side... and yet for some reason most of the American public believes that Lee Oswald did it.   <br>       Oswald is said to have done this, and he gets away... then he goes several miles away where he goes home and changes his clothes.    He could have simply remained there, but for some reason he decides go back outside to mix it up with the police - he is said to have shot a cop, then he escapes into a movie theater where he again is found and arrested after a description is put out on the radio for him.  It all defies logic at best - it truly does.   Oswald would seem to be the most important arrestee in US history, and yet for some reason a guy who owns striptease clubs is allowed to stroll down into into the basement of the Police garage where he walks right up with a loaded pistol and puts an end to the life of Oswald, and the case regarding the murder of our President is declared &quot;closed&quot; before it even began.    Really?<br>        I don&#39;t think Oswald was involved, and if he was, I believe he may have been a part of a group that was trying to infiltrate the group that did it so that it could be prevented - the real story seems to be something closer to that in my view.   At the very least Mr. Oswald seems to have been framed for the shooting.   And again, something so obviously full of errors is pushed upon the American public and the public believes it all without question.]<br>          So there are two examples of how the Public can be &quot;psychologically&quot; manipulated, and yes I do believe that this is occurring.    I do believe that the public is being psychologically manipulated - yes this seems clear.<br>          What about &quot;Scientifically Possible&quot;?   Is it even remotely &quot;Scientifically Possible&quot; for man to venture out into space?    Lets assume that we could get past the low earth orbit barrier of the Van Allen Radiation Belt.    Lets take that out of the equation for the sake of this argument...   And lets consider this:  Is it even possible to go into &quot;space&quot;... or the place where there is no air pressure at all.   In the first place we cannot even achieve such an environment here on earth in which we could use to test the equipment that would be needed.<br>         I have not looked at a few random videos online.    This comes from almost two decades of looking at 1000s of videos that are often quite compelling... they bring up countless very good points and observations.    So yes, I do not believe man has ever gone to the moon.   I also have my doubts about man going to low earth orbit.    Why do we not see the sun glimmering off all of these countless satellites and space debris that is supposed to fill the skies?   Something odd seems to be at play, and the internet is exposing it.   At the very least it is opening the door to some very interesting questions that have merit and are worthy of debate.... and debate is just that -  the sharing and exchange of information.   I will gladly listen to anything you have to say, but please don&#39;t say I&#39;m gullible and leave it at that.<br>           So what exactly is going on in this world?   I&#39;m not really sure.  I know enough to know that something is not quite right, so here is one possible explanation just for fun:    You may remember a time around the 50&#39;s or the 60&#39;s when the human race was building up nuclear weapons and testing them, and it seemed like if things continued in that direction, it seemed like mankind might wind up destroying the entire world.   Well what if the powers that be had decided long ago to end that madness and go in a different direction?   What if a part of that new direction included an experiment in which it was decided that any person born after a certain date would be given an education that is a little different than those born before the certain date -- those born after the certain date would not be told everything about what man has learned about the world and the universe etc... and they would run this experiment to see how long it would take for the younger people to figure this thing out - that there is some sort of anomaly that is occurring right before our eyes, and in some cases the evidence for this is overwhelming, and there are clues everywhere, and the experiment is to find out how long it would take for the younger group to figure this out for themselves?   Suppose the &quot;answer&quot; is something like that?   Perhaps they have left it like this as a way of determining who should govern in the new age or what type of government we should have.   Are the elders doing an experiment to see how long it would take for the younger people to figure out that something weird must be going on?   Is this the reason that so many compelling challenges to the mainstream narrative exist?   Are people that are born after a certain date not being taught the whole picture?   Maybe this is what&#39;s going on....    I just don&#39;t know.   I know that something(s) don&#39;t seem to add up.

If you keep getting smarter every day, eventually you are going to figure out for yourself that the entire space thing seems to be a big scam.

I guess you would probably seal off this room.... ahhh..... and then I guess you would have to do a space walk or something - I guess????    I dunno.&quot;<br>     Are you kidding me?   And that guy was supposedly riding in the &quot;real&quot; space station as an astronaut - he supposedly was in the exact type room out in space and he was manipulating the very same screws, and yet he is 100% clueless about what to do if one of those janky o-rings should start letting out air... he had no idea.<br>       And then you go and you speak with the guy who invented the two channel o-ring design, and you spoke to him about how precise those channels need to be, and you asked him if it was true that the o-ring was forced to become an oval when pushed into that channel...  I learned something myself at that point.<br>        So the guy gives you a kind of funny look, and he agrees that yes that is how the o-ring works by causing it to go from a circle shape to an oval shape....   So the guy knew that you knew something about what you were talking about.<br>      Then you said to the guy something like, &quot;The design you made 20 years ago is still operating flawlessly today&quot;.<br>      Then the guy laughs and says, &quot;Well I hope it is flawless&quot;, and then he asks, &quot;Are you sure the guys in Italy went with our design?&quot;, it&#39;s like he doesn&#39;t want people to figure out that there is no possible way those o-rings could work in that configuration... and would you really decide that two o-rings is enough?    How about 14 of the damned things just as a thought - or how about 32 of them?   Oh, two should be plenty.... it&#39;s just air - we can always find more...,    &quot;Cause... ummmm...  I don&#39;t know....  I never did bother to follow up on it&quot;.    Again, really?   Like really?    The guy supposedly invented the part, and it was his patent, but he never bothered to follow up on it???    Is that a fact?    <br>       &quot;Are you sure the guys in Italy used our design?&quot; ...  Just what was he saying by asking that?     Is there some universal and totally obvious reason that they wouldn&#39;t use your design?    After all, that o-ring design is the reason you went to go see the man and interview him.    I&#39;ll tell you what I think -  I think that o-ring system would work just about perfectly in a water tank here on Earth, but out in space I don&#39;t think I would put a lot of faith in those o-rings.

Well what do we have here! We have the reflected light from Earth, and I would estimate that is about\u00a03 to\u00a05 times brighter than the lunar surface light,\u00a0yet we can clearly see stars? and lots of them.Conversely, if the Moon landing were not faked, and the light contrast is correct, then this is ISS stuff is\u00a0faked.Frankly I\u00a0believe both the Lunar and ISS stuff is all\u00a0faked, mainly\u00a0because it is technologically and environmentally impossible.Also recently I have been looking along the shoulder lines\u00a0of these\u00a0alleged astronauts, and they all have strange upper shoulder lines, as if\u00a0it is pinched on both side, or something from a harness belt is pressing into the back of their shoulders. I would say it is because they are wearing wireman harnesses.Also O-rings are\u00a0very\u00a0prone to shrinking and splitting due to temperature\u00a0changes, especially cold, remember Challenger!Yet here we have temperatures on the outside of this ISS from day to night varying by\u00a0-250 to +250\u00a0degrees every 1 1/2 hours ! or 16 times per Earth day.

So, some parts of the spectra affected by the heliospheric modulation, for example, cannot be interpreted. I discuss and adopt an exact solution of the Fokker-Planck equation arXiv1610.01584, which gives a complete description of a ballistic, diffusive and transdiffusive (intermediate between the first two) propagation regimes.

I would guess similar seals/o-rings exist on submarine/boat propeller/rudder shafts, these seals exist in many shafts in internal combustion engines, gearboxes, reduction gears, differentials etc. to prevent oil leakage, so they are not really that... worth jumping up about. you would be surprised though there are only two of them, and not like... 5 or 7 of them, and no outer &quot;seal&quot;, to prevent dust or debri damaging the o-rings, also - as the large pressure difference from the side the pressure is applied (obviously from internal side in the ISS, or from the oil side in engine, or water side in a submarine), sometimes circular rubber seals are being deployed, sometimes with a metal reinforcement inside, and have a special rubber &quot;lip&quot; or &quot;rim&quot; on the seal that presses against the sealing surface in order to prevent pressure - and media - leakage. This is actually even more impressive if you think of valve guide seals in an ICE - and think that valves move through those seals several thousands of times every minute for a lifespan of tens of years, and yes they&#39;re still rubber (although with a small metal reinforcement ring), and yes they&#39;re subject to high temperatures of 100-300 degrees C, and yes they&#39;re in chemically aggressive environment - think of oil/gas/diesel and micture of these... so these ISS seals although still doing their job, are not that jaw dropping. yeah astronauts&#39; lives depend on them, but there are 3-6 astronauts on the ISS, and 7 seals in the cuppola, but there are millions of ICEs running around the globe with at least 2, in most cases 16 or even 24 seals in every one, and although let&#39;s say stuff like valve guide seals may leak sometimes, leading to valve stem being oily and what eventually causes the car to lose some milliliters of oil and causing some blue smoke, not necessarily an astronaut dying, but i&#39;d say stuff like that - if you think of it, is much more impressive. you&#39;re kind of used to the fact and regard it &quot;normal&quot; that ISS is overengineered and all &quot;amazing and stuff&quot;. however, I would probably not trust italians to put together my cuppola, but hey - still works, right? anyway - congrats on getting footage from the ISS and from a beautiful italian.", "comment_date": "2017-03-18T00:29:45Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Betterdayscoming", "comment_text": "So much hair gel and hair spray needed in space.

A normal SCUBA tank is filled to 200 atmospheres, or about 3,000 psi and only one O-ring is holding all that pressure when connected to the regulator. A regulator has\u00a0an internal O-ring as well and it is dynamic, always moving with every breath you take. Now THAT&#39;S impressive engineering. 3,000 psi is a lot of potential energy, basically a bomb waiting to explode. 14.7 psi is nothing, if you put 14.7 psi of pressure in your bicycle tire, you would simply have a flat tire. There, I just gave you an idea for your next video... How a SCUBA regulator works. It&#39;s very simple yet surprisingly effective and not a lot of people actually know how it works.

Way way more complicated and so many engineering feats that make the Space Station look like a Tonka toy. I had a friend who used to work for NavSea designing systems for subs. He moved to NASA because it was a lot easier and he didn&#39;t have to work so hard, plus he said, if the Space station has a problem, we can evacuate the crew and only loose about  a billion dollars or so...loose a sub and there are about between 130 to 150 guys who could almost  never escape. He said the stress was too great, so he went to NASA. Go tour a submarine and see what&#39;s involved even in the older WW2 designs. Look into what it takes to become qualified in submarines.

The third, fourth, etc\u2026 all fly off into the distance trying to fill the vacuum by finding their empty corner. So no matter how much gas you produce none of it will ever change the pressure under a space ship. None it if will ever push a spaceship. To push a spaceship there must be some locally high pressure under it, which is impossible since the pressure in space is 0 everywhere.<br><br>Back the the Nozzle and the Massflow equation F=MA on earth<br>Think about a fire hose shooting water. A force comes directly back against the column of water shooting out. Why? Because the first drop of water has to pas through air, which is dense, causing many collisions, slowing down the drop of water. The second drop, directly behind the first, will not be slowed down by the air so it will collide with the first drop, the third drop hits the second drop and so on, the fast water coming through the hose pushing through the slower water outside causes Newton\u2019s 3rd Law to push back on the column of water. This is why you need people holding the hose to add an unbalanced force otherwise the hose would not be able to push water through that column anymore, the water column would be diverted and the hose would flop around. It is obvious that one drop of water does not push back on the hose, you need a fast moving column.<br><br>The nozzle and the Massflow equation in space<br>Since the molecules leaving the combustion chamber and entering the vacuum never slow down, never collide with any outside objects, nor with each other, their force is always moving forward, away from the ship. There is no way for that force to be returned to the ship. There is no way for the force of the moving molecules to be extracted and used for propulsion. Their force is carried off into the far corners of space. This is also known as Joule Expansion. Remember that as soon as the nozzle is opened, the combustion chamber becomes part of the vacuum of space as is subject to its laws. A closed chamber is under pressure but not an open one.<br><br>NASA is lying at the molecular level<br>But that\u2019s OK because most people don\u2019t usually look there. The awesome, spectacular and heroic nature of space exploration is enough to cloud the most logical minds. Most respectable engineering schools won\u2019t touch space flight and those who do have tiny departments. If it was really a multi-billion dollar government funded operation, every school in America would have their hands out for government grants like the do with Engineering, Computer Science and Biology.

Using o-rings for seals between areas that have a difference in pressure is extremely common.

I mean, with the space station, we&#39;re talking a measly 14.7 psi of pressure and that&#39;s assuming they always keep it at 1 atm in there. I don&#39;t know for sure, but I would suspect they keep it at an even lower pressure than that considering humans can live comfortably at much lower pressures (down to 0.5 atm or so before it becomes noticeably uncomfortable--not taking into account the O2 concentration). So, yeah, those o-rings have to withstand less pressure than the o-rings in your bike tire pump and they work on a very similar design/principal. <br><br>Still, a GREAT video!!", "comment_date": "2015-05-08T22:02:45Z", "likes_count": 17}, {"comment_by": "id13", "comment_text": "just gasket", "comment_date": "2015-05-08T22:01:47Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Bailey K", "comment_text": "I could only imagine how Charlie felt after finding out his design was used on the ISS, and is still being used today.", "comment_date": "2015-05-08T22:01:46Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Dan Hunter", "comment_text": "At <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KSzuiqVjJg4&amp;t=6m00s\">6:00</a> in, I noticed marks on the window behind Samantha.
