For large friction and close spacing the impact with the next domino will occur before slipping, but at larger spacing and low friction slipping will occur before impact with the next domino. This will affect the time interval and the impulse on the following domino and hence the speed of the toppling wave. It would be nice to have data on the felt and the wood floor at different domino spacing but I realize that the work for one spacing was already more than enough. It would also be interesting to have dominos with a small protrusion at the center of the top edge so it always hits the next domino on its center line.

Now as the second falls there is more weight on the second because the first has more surface contact on the second which is more friction.  With the slipping surface the corner of the first domino is in longer contact with the second domino instead of the entire surface area meaning less friction because the contact area is smaller. Also, as the first falls and slips instead of it&#39;s main contact being at the top and just causing the second to tip over the first slides down the second and uses that force to push the second domino over instead of just tipping it over.

I would always try to avoid averaging data this way, because this way the data looks way more systematic than it is, and one or two &quot;failed&quot; points can already lead to something that looks systematic in the averaged data. You can see it at <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9hPIobthvHg&amp;t=7m05s\">7:05</a>: I bet if you keep the 12th &amp; 13th last point from hardwood out of the average, you will not see any increase at the end anymore at all. The speed increases there due to probably some different distance between the 14th &amp; 13th last dominos, and therefore it LOOKS in the averaged data like the speed in the whole area of 20 dominos around these two increases systematically, while its only these two. <br>The noise can get you more information as well: In the felt data at <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9hPIobthvHg&amp;t=7m05s\">7:05</a> one can clearly see a systematic decaying noise in the beginning that looks quite similar to the curvature of an damped harmonic oscillator without sign change. Actually really good looking data as these narrow maxima could also easyly be halved and broadened if they would be shifted just like half a point distance. So I think the twist of the dominos can be described as an harmonic oszillator, and the felt damps the twist. I think this twist comes in the beginning from imperfect hit of the very first domino, and as the felt holds the dominos more, the time constant of the oszillator is higher there, it needs longer to oscillate out into an undamped oszillation (which makes also sense as one could understand gravity in this case as a periodic excitation). In the hardwood case this whole damping in the beginning cannot be seen as the time constant ist to small, so the whole damping happens in much less time / dominos, as hardwood doesn&#39;t hold the dominos so much. And then the whole damping is ofc also covered by other effects in the beginning like the acceleration of the whole system.", "comment_date": "2020-06-04T15:07:20Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Thomas Andreeff jr", "comment_text": "You know what they say about cousins in Alabama (*-*)", "comment_date": "2020-06-03T08:03:39Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Hannah", "comment_text": "This video has convinced me that the worst thing a parent can do is tell a kid to stop asking &quot;why&quot; and &quot;how&quot;.", "comment_date": "2020-06-03T06:55:34Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Black Jack", "comment_text": "It looks like the sound wave speeds on the different pressure, air/water, humidity, frequency and etc. Each condition causes different speed, especially in a micro view, but not too different in the macro view.<br><br>The trigger of wonder is really important and it makes difference.

First, would it be beneficial to repeat the set-up but take the high speed video from above the dominoes? There may be a predictable frequency in which the dominoes hit and twist, first one way, then the other. Secondly, is it possible that the twisting of the dominoes is actually a function of the location of the initial push on the first domino? If the strike on the first domino is anything but dead center on the upper part of that domino, that &quot;off-centerness&quot; could introduce a bias which is amplified as the falling of the dominoes progress. This could also be tested with the overhead camera.

At first I thought nothing of this, because it&#39;s just constant force applied, but then I watched light, and how Rodney Mullen does created the impossible flip, and how in space you get the intermediate axis spin to go chaotic because the force applied is never perfect. The force is like a wave and the intermediate axis force applied isn&#39;t perfect so the force, weight, gravity, friction / atmosphere. I understand the slip vs grip test, but there would need to be way more material test for the perfect amount to keep the force for the most speed, since they both kinda caught up like when vsauce and adam savage built The Brachistochrone, they all will catch up even with slightly different amounts of friction. Showing force vs distance vs speed, and the friction difference would be minimal almost I believe. Grip = people falling over with shoes vs Slip = people falling over with mushed banana&#39;s on their feet. Once they fall over onto the next person, the bottom is what keeps the object stable on the top, so the intermediate axis is less chaotic and keeps more force, while the bottom has grip to push it to regain it, but the Slip has more chaotic but less chaotic at the bottom once force is reapplied to regain the force. I think friction would need to be more extreme for tests, atmospheric pressure maybe, longer perfect distance, but I think the same thing would happen but you&#39;d see even more detail like how liquid physics has become.

This will make it so the data you get on each surface is more accurate. The time you get won&#39;t be that much different - and you will have worked a lot less.  Work smarter, not harder, right? I would ALSO put them in a vacuum to completely rule out air resistance / possible tiny gusts of wind. (since you are talking about in a vacuum right?)  If not - then just put a plastic box over them and a mechanism inside that tips the first domino at a near EXACT amount of energy. AGAIN - you SHOULD use a mechanism that does the first tip since the speed at which you knock over the first domino can change and that will put a variance in your times you don&#39;t want.  Another idea - instead of using a camera - use a very sensitive recording device / microphone and just judge the distance and time by the SOUND of the clinks!  This I believe would be more accurate since you won&#39;t rely on a VISUAL queue which can be off.

I am a practical application engineer/carpenter/mechanic/designer/teacher/musician. As I watched your observations my thoughts wandered back to when I was a child in the 60s. Space and physics have always amazed me. Here are a couple of considerations.<br>1. Gravity <br>2. Earth&#39;s rotation<br>3. Gyroscopic reverberation<br>4. Concusive reaction<br>5. Rebound<br>6. Sonic frequency <br>Ok, so there are more than a couple. Ha ha ha...<br>A part of the baseline to consider must be dominoes of different materials to observe the variables in reactions. For example: You used clear acrylic dominoes. What about the standard ebony (black wooden) type or dense white plastic, marble, aluminum, stainless steel, and so many others that dominoes have been made of.<br>My observations caused me to think about so many of the variables and even counter-variables such as momentum responding to the impact which in turn reacts to the vibrations caused by the impact becoming a completely different and opposing force causing the tiles to walk backwards while still falling forward. The noise on hardwood clearly allows far more reactions to be seen as compared to the felt which as you said muted and provided traction, but in turn provided a different  set of reations.<br>I realize that there millions of tangents presented here; however, my first thought was frequency. As in vibrational reaction and responses. Starting with the initial contact each successive contact is altered by every physics law applied all at once and varied by each individual response and following reaction.<br>The acrylic material is a highly melodic type of material in other words, it conducts high moving frequencies and sound vibrations. Think of dropping an 8 foot long 2x4 on a concrete floor. The board will hit the floor, bounce, make a sound, and all the while it will be vibrating at differing frequencies throughout it&#39;s length from end to end. The length and width will obviously influence all of those responses and reactions accordingly, along with density and weight. Of course this is just one set of variables. Other variables like reflex, rebound, sound waves, and so on....<br>Hopefully you and your physics enthusiasts can see the amazing possibilities presented here.", "comment_date": "2019-12-31T06:53:52Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Azmythometre", "comment_text": "Watching this while eating dominos pizza", "comment_date": "2019-12-31T05:49:01Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Ricky107", "comment_text": "&quot;Cute little nerds who set these up&quot;", "comment_date": "2019-12-30T04:40:16Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Chrissy Moore", "comment_text": "Why didn\u2019t you factor in the way in which your niece hit the dominoes with the stick.

It&#39;s like a pulley system in a way. With enough dominoes, the tail segment is laying down almost fully while the pieces which haven&#39;t yet fallen are starting to. You have an impact which sends a lot of that energy in to the isolated piece causing a spike in velocity. Then the front of the tail lays down on the previously impacted component. So you have the initial spike and acceleration but that piece slows down when the piece lays on it for the second time because it is being limited from falling all the way over.<br><br><br>As for the asking questions bit... ie: to simplify a problem, break it down and create stepping stones or building blocks... I do this in programming. In fact, it is why programming exists. You create something small to do a set task. You plug that in where you need that task done and you use it as a building block in your application. The problem I see most with developers is them going to great lengths to make a problem seem more complicated than it is and failing at completing the task because they end up writing algorithms lasting thousands of lines, unbroken, which could&#39;ve been solved by many smaller algorithms.<br><br><br>I always tell my students to write out what they want to do - design... Then expand on that. What do you mean by this, how is this done? etc.. etc.. I also advise them to find repetition in code, and turn it into a helper. Something simple being shadowed text ( which is just drawing the shadow first, offset, then the other line of text second so it renders on top and turning it into a function so instead of writing 2 lines of code each time, they write 1 ) or drawing a rectangle with an L bracket on 2 corners or so ( Which is just DrawRect and DrawLine * 2 * 2 for 2 corners. I usually set up an Ex function to draw in all 4, then a normal non Ex with fewer args which calls the Ex for the most common corners - 1 line of code to make something visually appealing ).<br><br><br>Things that are more useful can be simplified the same way.. Huge benefits to this means you can build up a repo of building blocks you can pick and choose from, so if you design something in the simplest form, you can expand on it and see if any of your previous blocks exist.. More times than not, you will re-use a lot of code.<br><br><br>For structures, I use Accessor Functions ( dynamically generated functions ) for my getters / setters ( and even more which communicate with those such as Get Value then ToString combined into 1, Has Value via Get != None )... using these AccessorFuncs I can write 1 line and generate 50 functions. I can generate helpers for an object to reset data, set, or whatever in 1 line for systems that require setting / getting / resetting data to these more than 1 point at a time and if I want to put it on 1 line instead of multiple SetX( 0.0 ), SetY( 0.0 ), SetZ( 0.0 ) I can just do Reset( &#39;x&#39;, &#39;y&#39;, &#39;z&#39; ).... Most of the functions I create are for the value, but the others, such as Reset helper for the object, may only be 1/3 the amount and only the first time per object... but it makes it so I can create a new 3D position object in 3 lines plus the setup of 3 lines. X / Y / Z exists, I can auto generate a tostring output to include these auto generated or write one manually if I want to include other information. <br><br><br>etc.. etc.. etc..<br><br><br>I don&#39;t understand why people would generate thousands of lines of code all of which stems on basic repetition... I would rather spend time creating something new, adding it to my library and move on. That&#39;s why I do what I do. Efficiency matters, as well as accuracy. If there is a mistake  - you fix it in 1 place instead of 10s or thousands.<br><br><br>I see it over and over and I try to help correct that behavior, or to overcome the sense that a complex problem requires complex code, to allow them to create working applications much quicker than previously.

When the orange domino falls, after <b>at least</b> 2 strikes,* there is a third strike* at the very bottom on the corner.

Maybe at that distance, it takes that kind of last micro-second collision to get the vertically sliding effect. ..............................  *&quot;At least&quot; Maybe 2 more.    I&#39;ve seen another curious phenomenon: When striking a hard surface, like a desktop, with a sharpened, wooden pencil at a steep angle, the graphite tip does not hit just one time. It skips. There are two sequential line segments. What is happening here? My guess is that the pencil tip bends more quickly than the rest of the pencil body. The tip bounces up, imparting energy into the pencil body, then the tip rebounds and hits the surface again, thereby imparting a second push into the pencil.

A domino will approach another at a comfortable speed and more or less levering about it&#39;s bottom corner and strike it.  That solid strike will propel the next domino with great aplomb.

There seems to be a clear difference in the &quot;variance&quot; of the speed caused by felt vs hardwood. Just like you did a moving average, you could show a moving variance. From this data, felt seems to be less stable around the average, with a higher variance than hardwood (much more aggressive spikes and dips). It&#39;d be interesting to know why. Maybe it&#39;s because hardwood lets dominoes slide and that smooths out their twist and resistance to hits. Also, from the data it seems that the variance with felt decreases over time. It&#39;d be interesting to know whether this is just a chance, or whether this must be the case. With a longer experiment, would the felt graph get closer around the moving average, or would aggressive spikes happen again after some time?<br><br><br>Another interesting analysis you missed is about the &quot;period&quot; of the twists. It definitely seems from the footage that the twists have a period (like a wave) that perhaps can be predicted. They seem to have a twist in a certain direction, that goes from more aggressive to less aggressive over time; then at some point the twist becomes null and a new twist starts in the opposite direction. Even from the graph you can see the effects of this, as a change in the speed, which has the shape of a wave.

If all you want is the rates of &quot;travel&quot; of falling dominoes, just use audio of individual hits.

As long as the dominoes pass through, the total potential energy should be transformed into kinetic energy of the last domino.(Of course also some lost of energy from heat or deformation)<br>We can see the falling domino bouncing over and over between the falling and fallen dominoes, so it&#39;s kind of transmitting two  different energy, &quot;rotating&quot; and &quot;falling&quot; energy to only kinetic energy.<br>Also, there is a point why there is a perturbation.  As the domino tend to rotate, more time is needed to catch up to the next domino.  But the fun thing is that as you rotate more, you tend to bump into the previous rotating domino, the bumping makes the perturbation of the domino that changes the rotating energy transform to falling and kinetic energy.  But the perturbation needs time, and the previous dominoes should also be considered, which makes a cycle of spikes.<br>Last, still no good answer for which is faster, the heartwood or the felt.  To me I&#39;ll guess it would be the same average velocity for both two.  I guess the felt is faster at first just because the transmit and the perturbation of rotation and kinetic energy is faster in felt, slower in heart wood.(Felt kind of stick the bottom part of dominoes which makes the perturbation happens faster, but in the long run it doesn&#39;t matters.  Just guessing) <br>But it would be great if longer domino series is set to see if it&#39;s true that the heartwood does catch up at last.<br><br>If anyone is watching this comments, thanks for watching lol.

It seems to me you overlooked one mayor factor - the initial velocity and rotation of the first domino (not to underestimate your cousins ability to push dominoes...). Because, if you think about it, the &quot;rotation&quot; you speak of probably comes from the rotation of the initial domino, and then propagates. In a perfect mathematical model, if you pushed the first domino straight, no rotation would occur - ever. Also, about the speed of propagation - it depends on the time it takes for one domino to clear the distance to the next one. Now, it can do so by falling straight down, in which case the time it takes is determined by gravity - so, quadratic. On the other hand, it can also rotate on the vertical axis hitting the next domino with one side, and this is linear. The true speed of propagation is then a combination of the two.", "comment_date": "2017-12-12T08:45:39Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Greasy Buttocks", "comment_text": "I only see gibberish, I really need to go to school......", "comment_date": "2017-12-12T08:43:44Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "srikanth", "comment_text": "thats too much physics for me..", "comment_date": "2017-12-12T08:42:46Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "hobbified", "comment_text": "A domino that gets hit lower, and slides, should take longer to hit the next domino (lower propagation velocity), for two reasons.

Second, because gravity is putting energy into the system by toppling (once the domino reaches its tipping point, gravity accelerates its rotation, and the further it tips over, the more work gravity does on it, until it hits the ground), and a domino that gets hit lower will reach the tipping point later and topple slower.<br><br>I&#39;d love to see the data, but that&#39;s my guess.", "comment_date": "2017-12-12T08:42:41Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Kyle Boates", "comment_text": "Hayden is really cute!", "comment_date": "2017-12-12T08:41:26Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "BecozPro", "comment_text": "This was surprisingly motivating as an aspiring researcher, it suddenly makes the little problems that seem fairly inapplicable to daily life feel a lot more important, or at least that they <b>could</b> be more important.

My son and I had this discussion way back when you did the last domino video and it centered around the triggering mechanism to start the chain reaction. This has to be constant,  same force applied to the same spot on the domino all the time.  What you did introduced too many varables and gave you rough data. By using the constant,  the data cleans up a bit and then you can ask questions about the twisting and such. You can even introduce different forces at different spots on dominoes that are placed in the same order... food for thought.

I wonder if the cycles are in any way consistent? does each cycle last the same number of dominoes?  or does that number vary based on the speed and distance apart? Also I found it quite interesting that the moving average of the data was relatively simple in that it evened out, however the noisy data was almost sinusoidal. Also, I wonder what the difference in speed is between the left and right sides of the domino within each &quot;cycle&quot;? does that have any bearing on things? I bet if you graphed just one side of the domino at a time the graphs WOULD be sinusoidal, I also think that that might be an interesting way to look at it. In that way you could find the nodes of the system and that would... I don&#39;t know... that would do lots of things. That could help you find the period of the cycles you mentioned. That could also help give a better explanation for the differences in speeds on different surfaces. Additionally, that could also give you a better idea of how distance plays a role, and why the chain stopped in that one trial. Oh I am loving this.

So bear in mind that at this particular point in the comment, I have yet to watch the full length of the video. Be sure to read the whole thing through.<br><br>So one of the things that I observed in your attempts to suss out the physics of falling dominoes on paper is that you tried to reduce the problem down to the simplest possible case of just one domino simply leaning against the other. There&#39;s a problem with that. That&#39;s only taking into account one domino affecting the next. When in reality (and this is something that can be seen in the high speed camera footage), it&#39;s not just <b>one</b> domino leaning into the next to knock it over. It&#39;s that one domino and the several dominoes <b>behind it</b> that combine both their mass <b>and</b> momentum that overcomes the static resting momentum of the next domino in line to also knock it over. The energy wave propagates accordingly all the way through the line of dominoes.<br><br>You can&#39;t reduce the problem down to just one domino leaning against another and suss out the physics that way.

The velocity variation between hardwood and felt mainly occurs due to the coefficiant of friction of both materials being different. The reason why the felt graph is more chaotic is because it&#39;s coefficiant of friction is more. So the energy in the system decreases faster which reduces your velocity. Whereas if you look at the hardwood graph, it&#39;s velocity variation  is fairly constant. Which is also why when blue Iris took the average, in the end hardwood was faster. Not because it &quot;caught up&quot; but because felts energy was reducing much faster than hardwood. Also  material of the Dominoes matters too.

So, my suggestion is to get back to the basics.  The absolute basics.  <br><br>I think that some of the variability in your system comes from the boundary condition between the base of each domino and the floor.  That boundary condition, for each domino in the chain, is ever so slightly different.  There&#39;s differences in the geometry of the base of the dominoes.  There are frictional differences.  There&#39;s surface texture differences (especially on the carpet surface).  I think those differences start the twisting phenomenon that you are seeing.<br><br>You didn&#39;t show the paper physics model that you were working on, but I bet that you were assuming a fixed boundary condition at the base of the dominoes, and not the highly variable conditions that exist.<br><br>I would develop an experiment that eliminates the variability in the boundary condition between the base of the domino and the floor.  That will best match your paper physics model.  How to do that?  Perhaps you could tape each domino to the floor.  Develop a very precise technique to tape the dominoes to the hardwood floor, at very precise spacing.  Then, knock them down and generate your timing graph.  Plus, with the dominoes taped down, setting up the system for another run should be relatively easy.<br><br>I think you will learn a lot from this very basic experiment.  (Remember, do Basic Research.)  My guess is that doing your best to eliminate the variation in the boundary conditions between the floor and the bottom of the domino will smooth out your timing graph.  Also, I&#39;d develop a mechanism to push over the first domino in a consistent manner.  It looked like the first domino was being pushed long after it hit the second domino.

You are initiating the dominoes with a flat sided ruler pushed by hand. This could easily cause variables in the initial rotation of the dominoes and could introduce a more pronounced wave in the pattern of &quot;rotating&quot; dominoes to the &quot;slam&quot; dominoes. Doing it by hand could also introduce a greater or lesser initial momentum that gets carried through the whole set. Maybe initiate the dominoes with something like a spring fired pin that strikes the initial domino it the same spot and at the same speed every time. <br><br>2. Surface variables - For the hard wood there are going to be many variations from board to board that could possible effect results from run to run. Differences in grip from board to board, wood grains, the small gaps between boards. Looking at your graphs you see a moment where the hard wood actually accelerates to a speed greater than the felt before correcting back down. might be from a slightly higher traction on 1 board before correcting back down on a more slippery board. Felt can have an entire set of its own differences that could effect the dominoes on the other side. I&#39;m thinking something like a long piece of class would be a good surface to do the &quot;slick surface test&quot; and possibly a long strip of rubber mat would be good for the &quot;High Traction&quot; test.<br><br>3. For ultimate comparison, I remember they used to have domino sets where it was plastic rails that each had 10 or so dominoes affixed, I think they are called pivot track dominoes... you would place these tracks of dominoes end to end to make your full run. You would have a run where every domino was in the exact same order facing the exact same direction running on a &quot;constant fricktion surface&quot;.  A good run of these affixed to a board to ensure consistent spacing between tracks, fired with a pin to ensure exact starting velocity, should give a somewhat &quot;variable-less&quot; run and may show once and for all if you can or can&#39;t predict the fall speed of a particular run of dominoes.<br><br>In either case, I love domino videos and I love your videos so maybe I am just being picky so I can see you make more domino videos.", "comment_date": "2017-12-11T19:04:50Z", "likes_count": 76}, {"comment_by": "Radostin Angelov", "comment_text": "i&#39;m really curious to know Destin&#39;s IQ", "comment_date": "2017-12-11T19:04:39Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Vivek S", "comment_text": "MY MIND IS BLOWN !", "comment_date": "2017-12-11T19:04:37Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "SpluDD RoTT...
