I have really enjoyed your episodes about helicopters, but the part that really fascinates me about autorotations is the science behind it, and I think that this video could have been much more informative.<br><br>RC helicopters often have no rotor blade washout and are capable of doing negative pitch, while real helicopters don&#39;t do much negative pitch, if any. Actually, interestingly enough, the only thing that drives helicopter rotor blades during an autorotation is the &quot;Driving Region&quot;, or middle portion, of the blades. See, the blades are sectioned off into driven, driving, and stalled regions, with the driving region in the middle section of the blade. The driven section, or the tip of the blade, creates a lot of drag. The inner portion of the blade is stalled, and is therefore a detriment. As you increase collective pitch, you diminish the driving region until it no longer exceeds the drag of the stalled and driven regions. There are good diagrams of this online.<br><br>If you were to look at a cross-section of the blade in an autorotation, you would notice that the blade can still create autorotative torque with positive pitch, which is as fascinating as it is counterintuitive. See, lift always acts perpendicular to the relative wind (angle of attack isn&#39;t related), and when you&#39;re in an autorotation, the relative wind is very much from the bottom of the blades. Because of this, the only thing that will stop the blade from being driven is if it is stalled, or if the airspeed is so great that the relative wind is too shallow to create a driving force. Well guess what? Towards the high-speed blade tips, the relative wind is at a shallow angle that places lift at or behind the rotor mast (negative torque, or drag). Towards the very slow root, you have a steep relative wind angle that exceeds the critical angle of attack and therefore stalls the blade. Towards the middle of the blade, you have a medium angle which provides that positive torque needed for the autorotation. Again, there are diagrams of this online.<br><br>I think if you included some more of the in-depth physics behind autorotative descent, you could really blow this out of the park!", "comment_date": "2014-08-11T03:33:56Z", "likes_count": 101}, {"comment_by": "Do\u011fa Say\u0131ner", "comment_text": "lol, the kid is just too adorable and I cannot focus on what I am told", "comment_date": "2014-07-23T18:43:42Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Jackie Monkiewicz", "comment_text": "Wait, so the engine power is out, but there must still be a separate power supply to control the swashplate, yeah?
