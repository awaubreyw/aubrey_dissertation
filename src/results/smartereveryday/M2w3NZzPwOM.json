I really enjoy KiwiCo and I think you will too. I got them as a Christmas gift for my children years ago, and it was a huge hit.  It was after that experience that I reached out to their team and asked if I could advertise for them because of how good it was for our family. I think you&#39;ll enjoy it too.   <a href=\"https://www.kiwico.com/smarter\">https://www.kiwico.com/smarter</a><br>It was 3 things...

Probably influenced by my understanding of work in the physics sense (force * distance). To me, the intuition comes for the visual of how only half of the displacement (pull) on the rope goes into moving the object. The key point is that, ignoring friction and the mass of the rope and pulleys, the work required to lift an object a given distance remains constant, and it&#39;s a trade-off between force and distance such that increasing the distance of the pull necessarily results in less force being required.", "comment_date": "2022-09-03T02:32:49Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Shevil Simoes", "comment_text": "I learnt everything i ignored about pulleys in 1st yr of engineering within 15 mins", "comment_date": "2022-09-02T18:30:28Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Mohamed Alli", "comment_text": "Not sure how I ended up on this video but this is cool.", "comment_date": "2022-09-02T13:29:42Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "\u0110or\u0111e Paunovi\u0107", "comment_text": "you are so cool and funny guy! that thing with &#39;can I check your snatch block&#39; made me laugh! :D", "comment_date": "2022-09-02T12:58:51Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "David Bishop", "comment_text": "You can&#39;t push a rope but you can feed one .", "comment_date": "2022-09-02T01:25:46Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "SaltyGamer", "comment_text": "You need to replace your tires on your jeep \ud83d\ude02", "comment_date": "2022-09-01T20:22:39Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "\u24c5\u24bd\u24be\u24c1 \u24cc\u24b6\u24c1\u24c0\u24ba\u24c7", "comment_text": "Will you do a video for me because I&#39;m poor?

There&#39;s got to be a way, using snatch blocks,  to multiply the amount of force it takes to wind up a spring, right?

I have wanted to build an elevator to raise smallish yard equipment up into my shop loft and simply cannot afford to spend a lot of cash on the project. I also want to be sure it will handle 4 times what I ever expect to lift. That means being capable of holding that weight as well. So if you can add snatch blocks and divide the weight by each block, that also means the holding brake would also only have the same as the lifting weight, right??  Short story: About 20 years ago I went to Indiana and bought an old Dodge. It was a few days before Xmas and a blizzard had just blown through the area and turned around and was headed back. So we had to load the car up fast. I had also bought the guys trailer that he said had all new brakes and a good winch. Well, the winch was gone and the snow was flying and his shop was surrounded by snowy grass on a slight hill.. He tried to pull the car up using a rope straight from the car to his truck. It was not working at all, but I saw that he had a few snatch blocks hanging on his tool wall and we put them to work. not only did we get the car up fast, but his truck wasn&#39;t spinning up his grass anymore!! Of course we had to drive his truck all the way across his yard, but it worked very well and we got on the road headed South pretty fast.  So what happens when you put the weight in the middle of a 6 or 8 pulley lift? Is it the same effect??", "comment_date": "2022-07-25T05:21:12Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Adrian", "comment_text": "POV: step sis stock in the washer <br>ME: lemme get my snatch block", "comment_date": "2022-07-25T04:57:32Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Aidan Griffin", "comment_text": "This video is awesome!

You will exert incredible force!! Due to sine, cosine and tangent...this really tickles me. When the angle you make on the rope gets away from straight (180 degrees) you exert less force. Block the vehicle in place, retie the rope, and pull again. Repeat as necessary. AND!!!

Your description was really confusing.  You didn&#39;t really explain what, why &amp; how very well.  I think you should do it again but show it back to back with a lever.  A lever is more efficient than a pulley though as you don&#39;t have near the loss in friction of the pullies.  If you put a lever with a fulcrum 1/4 of the way down the lever then one side of the lever moves 4 times as far as the other side.  A pulley works exactly the same.  You pull twice as far doubling it up with a pully so you have nearly double the leverage.  With a lever you get almost exactly double depending on your fulcrum but with a pulley there is notable loss of efficiency.  If you notice when you pulled 8 lbs vs 2 lbs it was noticeably less than the actual 8 lbs.  I think if you compare it directly to a lever that people can see they will better understand what you are trying to show as I understand it but the way you described it was confusing.", "comment_date": "2022-04-29T02:10:01Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Amirsadra Jafarpor", "comment_text": "\u0647\u0639\u0628 \u0645\u0627 \u0627\u06cc\u0646\u0627\u0631\u0648 \u062f\u0627\u062e\u0644 \u062e\u06cc\u0644\u06cc \u0633\u0628\u0632 \u062d\u0644 \u0645\u06cc\u06a9\u0646\u06cc\u0645<br>.............\ud83d\uddff\ud83d\uddff\ud83d\uddff\ud83d\uddff\ud83d\uddff", "comment_date": "2022-04-28T18:16:46Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Andr\u00e9 Soave", "comment_text": "Awesome applications to explain how the concept works and you make it with so much passion.

LoL <br>Great explanation! <br>Try this out:<br>You have 100lbs of groceries at the bottom of a staircase. If you make one trip, you&#39;d have to carry all one hundred pounds in one trip (one rope). If you make two trips, then you&#39;d carry 50% of the groceries or 50# with each trip (two ropes) but, have to travel twice as far (2 trips vs one). Three trips is 33% of the groceries or 33# (three ropes) but, three times the distance (3 trips vs one). Four trips=25% (four ropes) etc... You reduce the load with each trip and, but have to make more trips. This obviously doesn&#39;t include resistances or calculating the weight of the pullies into the load, and other factoring forces, but it&#39;s a relatable way of understanding the basics.

At the snatch block, for every foot of cable moved on the first side there is still only 1 foot of cable moved on the other side and it remains a 1:1 ratio and no mechanical advantage.

The truth is this device does not have a safe working load grading. It is dangerous and should not be used for taking weights. There are no recommended torque settings for the clamping nuts. They are not for load bearing. Never use in high tension situations...crane lifts, car retrieval, or your family on ziplines (mother in law exempt)...this clamp can slip anytime if not correctly tightened and from not re-tightening regulary. A rope constrict when applying tension, this narrowing can force it to release and slip. Serious accidents can occur. If people say other wise they are wrong..a looped wire rope must be spliced or mechanically collared, tested and tagged. Bulldog clamps don&#39;t comply. Sorry but its was my job...cranes and rigging work place health and safety trainer. btw a Canadian guy was killed in northern Thailand a few years ago on a zipline due to bulldog clamps.

I believe this could be explained using leverage of logs to exemplify distance input vs work done with varying fulcrum points.  That would help to explain doubling the length of rope pulled to distance of load moved.

With a single pulley, the amount you move the rope with your arm translates into the amount that the object moves. With two pulleys, the amount you move the rope with your arm is twice the distance that the object moves. It still takes the same amount of energy needed to move the object the same distance, but you&#39;re spreading out that energy with half the force required. At least that&#39;s how I understand it.

Your use of pulleys with the come-along give you way too much mechanical advantage and slows you down on the side of a road, which is not a place to hang out. Mechanical advantage comes at a price.

A genuine snatch block is one with an open cheek, or a built-in quick-release device so that it can be placed on and removed from the rope quickly, with one hand...like &quot;snatching&quot; a coin from another man&#39;s hand before he can close it. Ive sailed on square rigged ships, where the details of blocks and tackle are a minute-by-minute way of life. Snatch blocks are used on sails that have to be moved to another position quickly, and in the process their lines need to cross through another line, thus the need to detach the block, pass it around the other line, and re-attach it quickly.

This is a good generalization of how snatchblocks work without getting complicated. In practical use,  there are other things to keep in mind.  There will always be a certain amount of Frictional Resistance created from the sheave of the pulley. A snatch block only gets a 2:1 mechanical advantage when it&#39;s a straight &quot; out n back&quot; 180\u00b0 pull ( minus frictional resistance) for every degree of angle wider than 180\u00b0. The mechanical advantage decreases until you&#39;re no longer adding pulling power,  you&#39;re simply changing direction.  Another key thing to remember is where the load is &amp; how much. Simple numbers Example; use your jeep demonstration...1000lb load to move it.. run a winch cable from jeep to a snatch block anchored safely to a tree or whatever... straight back to your jeep.. yes,  2:1 advantage. Each &quot;leg&quot; only sees about 500lbs of load.. but the snatch block still sees the entire full load of both &quot;legs&quot; of the pull.. so it&#39;s critical to make sure the snatch block is rated for the entire load, not the reduced load you think you&#39;re pulling. There&#39;s so much more to using them safely,  but gotta learn the basics first.

So the work was initially f * d, but with the pulley it is 1/2 f * 2 d which is still f * d.  I expect Archimedes pulled a lot of rope to lift the war ship.  :-)", "comment_date": "2020-11-21T16:40:58Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "The freedom factory", "comment_text": "<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2w3NZzPwOM&amp;t=8m12s\">8:12</a> shakabra!", "comment_date": "2020-11-21T15:33:31Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Screw the cabal", "comment_text": "Yuli SERIOUSLY need some REAL tires on that jeep of yours!

I often show your videos to my high school science classes.  They&#39;re very entertaining and informative, and your cheerfulness always make them a pleasure to watch.<br>We teach all about this subject, blocks and tackles and mechanical advantage in the Royal Canadian Sea Cadets; it&#39;s a big part of seamanship.  Snatch blocks (we call all pulleys &quot;blocks&quot; in the Navy) are especially useful in an evolution at sea called a &quot;jackstay transfer&quot; when we shift equipment or people from one moving ship to another.  <br>One note about your tackles - in your examples they were all, using NavySpeak, &quot;rigged to disadvantage&quot; where the &quot;hauling part of the fall&quot; (the end you pull on, the &quot;fall&quot; being the rope) was pulling toward to the load.  This is how we usually rig tackles since they are generally moving up and we can use our body weight when pulling down.  BUT if the hauling part is rigged to pull the same way as the load is moving (&quot;rigged to advantage&quot;), it adds one more to the mechanical advantage.  This is possible if the tackle is pulling a load horizontally, for example along the deck of a ship.<br>Just thought I&#39;d mention that in case you wanted to investigate why that happens.  <br>Cheers!

It&#39;s the same principle as a gear box. Think of a car with manual transmission. Yes, in the lowest gear it&#39;s easy for the engiene to push the car along the road. But the trade off is that the car moves very slowly. So to get the car the same distance along the road as in a higher gear the engiene must put a larger amount of revoloutions into the gearbox (with the benefit of each resoloution being easier for the engiene). But all in all the same amount of energy (ingoring a lot of other practical factors) must be used to go the full distance along the road.<br><br>The pulleys does the same. They lower the force required to lift an object, but add more string to the setup. So while it&#39;s easier to pull the string you need to pull more length of string to lift the object to the top. Resulting in the same energy being required to do the job.<br><br>They say the way to do a really hard job is to divide it up in smaller pieces. Well a pulley system lets you divide a really hard lift up in a longer string.<br><br>When they pull the Jeep in the woods the same principle/result could have been achieved if the winch had an internal gearbox set to a lower rate of power transmission (not putting the experiment down - just offering another way to look at it).", "comment_date": "2020-11-06T00:07:30Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Madilyn Bumgarner", "comment_text": "I think he likes snatch blocks\ud83d\ude33", "comment_date": "2020-11-05T22:48:07Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Matt Alexander", "comment_text": "I think everytime somebody asks me what to do (even though it isn&#39;t remotely related to pulling something) I&#39;m gonna yell &quot;Snatch block!&quot;", "comment_date": "2020-11-05T21:59:16Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Nick Fiodor", "comment_text": "It&#39;s for children 5 years old.

Ran a 100 foot cable through the pulley system over to a hand crank ratcheting winch tied to a short post in the ground.  I was thinking of just using a rope through it, but I found that I still couldn&#39;t quite lift it up.   The winch worked but I should have pulled from another direction because my hoist pole started to lean away from the one side I didn&#39;t put a anchor rope, but I put a ratchet strap on it and cranked it back over.  It was still difficult to position the truss since my &quot;crane&quot; doesn&#39;t move.  then I got it to a point where I could release the winch and moved and used the pulley to stand the truss up and secured it with a spike.

Nice starter video, but you need to make another. good block and tackle or sets of snatch blocks will have different gear ratios (different size pulleys) to make up for the amount of rope being pulled through, so the block or set of snatch blocks always ride level. Now when you get into that, you&#39;re getting into complicated math... I don&#39;t do complicated math. By the way, I&#39;m in Alabama too, not far from Tuscaloosa. People out here are very friendly and are often willing to help with broke down cars...whatever. I&#39;ve always been that way, when I can I&#39;ll help somebody out, because I may need some help someday and what goes around comes around. For instance one day I had a flat tire.. okay no big deal right... wrong, I could not get the lug nuts loose even with a cheater pipe on the four way. A guy stopped to help, but even with the both of us on the cheater pipe, the lug nuts would not budge. All we managed to do was bend the fourway well twist and bend it.  Luckily I wasn&#39;t all that far from a tire shop, so I limped it on down to the tire shop on the flat.

So the more pulleys you use, the more the force is pulling on the frame, instead of your arms.", "comment_date": "2020-08-27T02:13:48Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "OVERCOME8", "comment_text": "I want the 3d printer.", "comment_date": "2020-08-27T01:02:02Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Q", "comment_text": "why can i picture Dwight shrutte from the office screaming snatch block at Jim....?lol", "comment_date": "2020-08-27T00:17:55Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Daniel Brunk", "comment_text": "Thats a lot of force maaan!", "comment_date": "2020-08-26T19:33:27Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Meijiro", "comment_text": "Sometimes when I take a break from studying I come back to this video just to see the <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2w3NZzPwOM&amp;t=12m01s\">12:01</a> bit", "comment_date": "2020-08-26T09:52:54Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Ruthvik Sankar", "comment_text": "This guy reminds me of Dwight from the Office. \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02", "comment_date": "2020-08-26T06:51:49Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "\u0455\u043d\u03b9\u0438\u03b9g\u03b1\u043c\u03b9", "comment_text": "Coming after watching Dr.Stone...", "comment_date": "2020-08-26T04:53:42Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Audie Aitken", "comment_text": "WELL JUST THE NAME IS AWSOME     SNATCH", "comment_date": "2020-08-26T04:46:12Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "KvndSr29", "comment_text": "I love your videos!

We know that if we can find a long lever and a fulcrum we can lift something heavy.  The heavy object moves a little and the working end of the lever moves a lot.  A lever is a machine; a force multiplier.  There is maths involved but lets not bother for now.  If you can make that very long lever shorter you can make the machine smaller and compact.  A rope is a bendy lever and the pulleys are lots of little fulcrums.  The math is always the same though where the lifting force is always proportional to the distance through which the force works.  Example: If you lift 100kg one meter into the air with 4 pulleys (in sequence) you need only 25kg load on the end but you need to pull the rope out 4 meters because 4x25=100.  Science, aint it wonderful?  Still struggling to understand?  Think of it in reverse where you have a 100kg bar balanced up in the air on a single column  That column feels a 100kg force pushing down.  If you support the bar with two columns the each feel 50kg pushing down, then 4 feel 25kg and 8 feel 12.5kg and so on.

Mechanical advantage always intrigued me. Work smarter, not harder!<br><br>My understanding of simple (vs compound) MA systems, was that to determine where the rope you&#39;re pulling on (or in the above case, the winch...or wherever the source of force originates) is attached, then add MA for every pulley that &#39;moves&#39; in the system. Clear as mud? Great, lets move on. lol I much prefer your summation and practical examples of MA, and very much concur in the &#39;class&#39; portion. The key to MA I always used was &quot;moving pulleys create advantage&quot;.<br><br>For a basic foundation: if the rope is attached to a 300lb load directly you would require 300lb force (not withstanding friction, etc), and is a 1:1 ratio. However if the rope is attached to an anchor, run back through a pulley and force is applied in the opposing direction, that is a 2:1 ratio (300lb load &gt; 150lb force). Note in the 2:1 (even numbered) the pulley at the load moves with the load toward the anchor. Force on rope attached to load will always result in an odd numbered ratio (1:1, 3:1, 5:1...); force on rope attached to an anchor will always result in an even numbered ratio (2:1, 4:1, 8:1...). To step from one ratio to the next, a pulley must move within the system. Anything that does not move only serves to redirect force - which is the whole purpose of using pulleys, but if they don&#39;t move - they don&#39;t increase the step ratio, thus reducing force necessary.<br><br>Bear in mind, this is true in a simple advantage system. When it gets into compound systems - its not so cut and dry.<br><br>So, to my question (and sorry for the lack of brevity): if my understanding of the physics is correct for simple MA systems, would your &#39;winch (force) &gt; snatch block (redirect; not moving) &gt; jeep hook (anchor)&#39; not result in a 1:1 redirected and no gain in MA?<br><br>I humbly ask to learn. Please don&#39;t think I&#39;m trolling. I love your videos. I leave them feeling smarter about something every time - absolutely true of this video. My quandary here is that your example with the jeep challenged my understanding.

He had grandpa&#39;s fence puller that featured two pulleys opposite each other by about 3 or 4 feet with old school hemp rope linking them and about 5 feet of pull rope. The wire would get placed in a groove with a clamp that exerted more force the more tension you applied. Hearing those pulleys creak and coming towards each other while applying a high level of tension to the wire with minimal force (from my then 90 pound frame) was amazing to watch. It also has a pulley brake system that keeps tension and automatically releases when applying pressure with the rope. (1930&#39;s tech-impressive practicality with mechanical means.) We also have a panel wire clamp and would use a pulley chained to a corner post using a tractor pulling opposite to add tension to hundreds of feet of panel.

Fundamentally, the reason why a simple pulley (the one illustrated at the start of his video) cuts the needed force in half is simply because it requires you to pull the rope twice as far!<br><br>It&#39;s really no different from reducing the gear ratio on your bike by a factor of two:  To move yourself the same distance, you only need to exert half as much force on the pedals, but need to move the pedals twice as far. [This is ignoring effects from friction.]<br><br>For instance, suppose you want to raise a 100 lb weight by 1/2 foot.  You can exert 100 lbs. for 1/2 a foot.  Or you can use a pulley system, exerting 50 lbs., but now you&#39;ll have to pull the rope by 1 foot. I.e., work  = force  x distance and, ignoring friction, you are raising the 100 lb weight by 1/2 foot in both cases, so you can do this using either 50 lbs. x 1 foot = 50 foot-lbs., or 100 lbs. x 1/2 foot = 50 foot-lbs. <br><br>In both cases you&#39;re doing 50 foot-lbs. or work; the pulley just allows you to do the work over twice the distance, thus halving the force you need to apply.", "comment_date": "2020-07-17T02:26:06Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Kirk Gillespie", "comment_text": "Hey Dustin love the videos!

On a mid sized yacht (30 - 50 ft) probably around half of the rigging uses some form of pulley system to generate a mechanical advantage. Additionally, we also use &#39;snap shackles&#39; (sailing equivalent of a snatch block) under certain conditions, not to gain a mechanical advantage, but to alter the direction of force (allowing us to change the sail shape to optimise performance).<br>As you were saying in your video, I (at least I think) am one of those people that can look at a pulley system and instantly understand it, thanks to my sailing experience.<br>Anyway, maybe when the current situation dies down a bit, you could find a friend (or make a new one) to take you out sailing.

First of all, love the video \u2014 great demonstrations, tons of fun, and I definitely learned something, so thanks a snatch-block!<br>First up, I definitely agree that having a fundamental understanding of something is better than just stating it in words. What many people miss, however, is that words are tools used for thinking as well as communication to others. Sometimes using the right words to define and shape your understanding might be the very thing that helps you attain or maintain it in the first place. <br>So with that in mind, if you ever come across this comment, let me know what you think of this terminology.<br> <br>Maybe it\u2019s just me, but it seems pretty clear that the more pulleys, the slower the movement of the load. In other words, mechanical advantage isn\u2019t magic, but simply a trade-off. In the examples in this video, load force was a limiting factor, but time (speed) and distance (of rope) were not, and trading these \u201cnon-limiting\u201d factors for the limited one(s) results in ease, i.e. an advantage. <br>One of the most visible examples of this is with the block&amp;tackle (<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2w3NZzPwOM&amp;t=4m00s\">4:00</a>)<br>Look at Destin\u2019s finger movement, then the movement of the load. More pulleys means more mechanical advantage, which transversely means less force input at any one time but also a slower movement of the load. <br>Another visible example is the Archimedes&#39; compound setup (<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2w3NZzPwOM&amp;t=9m37s\">9:37</a>) <br>The load of the first is the next pulley&#39;s input, and so on. So mechanical advantage is compounded, but so is the effect on distance/speed of the load. <br><br>(For anyone reading this, I\u2019d love to hear any thoughts/responses/additions etc. in the comments below)", "comment_date": "2020-06-08T12:36:41Z", "likes_count": 3}, {"comment_by": "green cabasge", "comment_text": "will be super appreciated if u can make a vid about how ancient people move stones for pyramids? thank you! love! is it related to pulleys? i guess it is hahaha!", "comment_date": "2020-06-08T05:35:15Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Tom Grisak", "comment_text": "I feel completely inadequate as a dad watching this.", "comment_date": "2020-06-08T04:56:08Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "FPV trys", "comment_text": "DON&quot;T SNATCH", "comment_date": "2020-06-08T03:52:41Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Newt5029", "comment_text": "Destin-  Show this to firefighters.

It doesn&#39;t double the load rating of the line, or the fastening,  you&#39;re using.", "comment_date": "2020-06-04T04:35:29Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Matthew Hare", "comment_text": "Those jeep tires are completely bald, buy some new tires before you have no grip", "comment_date": "2020-06-04T04:12:52Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "I'm Flare.", "comment_text": "Archimedes and Plutarch?

Both of these things happen because the blocks are not reeved (threaded) correctly.  Reeving it in this simple way causes the rope to wear out from sliding over the edge of every pulley wheel.  It also ends up twisting the rope leading to twisting the blocks relative to each other.  Eventually the rope will twist the blocks such that you have a mass of rope sliding against rope.  Ideally you want to pull from the center of the block and end at the center of the block to minimize these problems.  If you do it wrong, you can still get the rope moving up to rub against a rope moving down.  When the blocks are properly reeved, they will operate at about a 45 degree angle to each other, won&#39;t tilt, won&#39;t twist the rope, and won&#39;t rub.

It&#39;s the explanation. When You use 1/10 of resulting force You need to move the rope 10x  longer distance to rise the object with F force . We can create  an equation F1*s1=F2*s2 (F2 must be greater than (mass*10N/kg) of object to even raise anything) which tells us that the force applied is inversely proportional to the length of the rope being pulled to achive the same work-energy transfer on the &quot;heavy&quot; side. Of course we have to add a little friction. Anyway beside the movement there is another advantage of lowering force this way - mostly the force needed to keep something lifted/steady is much lower.

Try to consider the implication of friction.

But someone surely knows, if pullies had no friction would rope tension still decrease? Well it seems it has to because of the geometric leverage.  I know the tension decreases with 2nd and more pulleys, but I havn&#39;t quite modeled it in my mind enough to see how that relates to the idea of friction and tension changes through a system. The fun part for me at the moment is trying to conceptualize how hypothetically frictionless pulleys would still decrease rope tension. Because for me intuitive if there was no friction how could tension be changed?  Probably not that hard really, I will maybe edit my comment if I figure it out without cheating any time soon lol.

It&#39;s all about the math.  Pay attention in school kids, it will save your life.  Oh, and then for the most important part I  had to make sure it was all balanced, I scare myself now thinking years later on how easy it became I guess with lots of practice. The Biggest load I ever carried was Take Off Weight at 155,000 lbs. combined weight of cargo, aircraft, and fuel.  Hats off to my US Air Force Loadmaster instructors, they taught me well.

Before you can determine the amount of mechanical advantage being created, you have to determine if it is an odd or an even system by looking at the terminal end of the rope.  Only then can you count the number of moving lines to determine the mechanical advantage of the system.  If the terminal end of the rope is at the anchor (pulley demonstration at <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2w3NZzPwOM&amp;t=4m08s\">4:08</a>) then you have created an even system like the 4:1 demonstrated.  However, if the terminal end of the rope is at the load (Jeep at <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2w3NZzPwOM&amp;t=8m26s\">8:26</a>) you have created an odd system; unfortunately you didn\u2019t create any mechanical advantage with the Jeep because the pulley you inserted acted only as a change of direction.  With that being said, a change of direction can be useful (as demonstrated by your kids at <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2w3NZzPwOM&amp;t=1m21s\">1:21</a>) but it creates no mechanical advantage.  Additionally, the second pulley you inserted into the system when moving the pickup onto the trailer was also simply a change of direction with no mechanical advantage added.  However, with the same number of pulleys, you could have \u201cflipped\u201d the system so the terminal end of the rope was on the front of the truck.  Then run the rope to a pulley on the front of the trailer and back to a pulley on the front of the truck.  Now, since the terminal end is at the load, you have an odd system with a 3:1 mechanical advantage.  This is colloquially called a Z drag because the ropes form a Z pattern when laid out.

I love pushbikes. What I&#39;m wondering is why I have never seen anyone incorporate a pulley system on the old pushbike?<br>One old man lifting a warship with a pulley system, that is impressive on all kinds of levels! Surely a larger crank wheel (on a pushbike) would be easier to pedal with a pulley system in place, or is that what we already have with ten+ speed pushbikes, is that a pulley system or gears? Are they the same thing?<br>It seems like your pulley system helped make your children&#39;s efforts to raise the cinder block easier; decreasing their workload. I know pushbikes have been made with large crankwheels that no rider can crank, by himself, initially, but towed behind a car and then slipstreaming the same vehicle, cyclists have managed to break records. After seeing this video post, I&#39;m wondering if the workload of a tall crankwheel could be offset (with a pulley system in place)sufficiently enough for a cyclist to get their bike rolling under their power without the need of a car to tow the bicycle up to speed at all?<br>Are you the same guy I saw a post of (seems like years ago now) with a weird steering system, where you turn the cycle&#39;s handlebars the opposite way you traditionally would in order to negotiate a particular corner? I sort of noticed that at speed on a cycle you sort of already have to do that anyway, you lean right into the turn and, at least to my mind, you turn the handlebars the opposite way that you would think you need to do, to negotiate a particular corner? Maybe I&#39;m just imagining it, maybe you&#39;re not the guy that posted that video (it&#39;s been a while since I saw it, it could have been two or three years ago after all).<br>In any case, I could not unglue my eyes from your post regarding &quot;Snatch Blocks&quot;, Loved it, and shall check out these &quot;Kiwi Co&quot; kits as well.<br>Best Regards,<br>Carlos.<br>P.S., Am liking this and subscribing.", "comment_date": "2019-12-25T17:04:07Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "chaser107", "comment_text": "Great now I gotta get a snatch block", "comment_date": "2019-12-25T17:02:30Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Ken Campbell", "comment_text": "Ask any wrecker driver or crane operator and they will tell you that snatch blocks work and are used in their everyday operations.  Years ago, I quizzed a physicist about the principle behind how these pulleys and blocks work and was told it has to do with the Law of Conservation of Energy.  With each line extended and returned, you half the line speed, thus increasing the effort of your pulling force resulting in the &quot;conservation of energy&quot;. Personally, raised to vertical a 50,000# well drill that had been turned over on its side (30 foot tall derrick was raised and pinned in place at the time).

I actually like to pause it as soon as you have the experiment set up and think through what&#39;s happening before playing it to hear the explanation. In the first segment, when you are using a single snatch block with the ladder and cinder blocks, what I thought up is this: force applied over a certain distance. You have to pull the rope the total length of all the rope used to lift the blocks only half that distance. You have to think about how far the load is traveling and divide that by the length of rope you must pull to raise the load. <br><br>Also a little fun fact, you can also lift much heavier objects, even if they exceed the rope&#39;s rated strength. Because if you have multiple segments of rope running between sets of pulleys, the weight of the load is divided evenly between them, a 100 pound load divided among 10 segments of rope puts only 10 pounds of weight on each segment, even though it&#39;s all in the same continuous piece of rope, no single point of the rope is being subjected to more than 10 pounds of pull.<br><br>I&#39;m also a bit of a nerd for pulleys!

The &quot;tension&quot; is actually divided by the number of lines.  The force multiplication is due to the distance you have to pull per distance the load moves.  If you have only the rope (0 or 1 pulley&#39;s = 1 line) the load moves 1&quot; for every 1&quot; you pull the rope.  Add a second pulley = 2 lines now every 1&quot; you pull rope the load moves 1/2&quot; (that is the pull&quot; / # lines).  Add a third pulley and thus a third line and 1&quot; pull = 1/3&quot; load move.  You can probably run the pulleys in different configurations that would change the ratios but that is the basis.  Newtons law of Conservation of Energy realize that the amount of energy or work that you put into a system is what you get out - losses in the form of  sound, heat and light.  <br>So back to the example: if you have 2 lines it takes 2x the steps to move the load the same distance as it does with the 1 line.  Since the load is moved the same distance, it takes the same amount of energy or work to move it.  An example is the difference between walking up steep steps vs. a ramp.  The stairs might be half the length and thus half the steps as the ramp but the ramp is easier to walk up.  But once you get to the top of the stairs and your friend to the top of the ramp both will have exerted the same amount of energy.", "comment_date": "2019-12-17T03:42:22Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Matt Vance", "comment_text": "Absolutely awesome as always Destin!", "comment_date": "2019-12-17T03:42:15Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Harry Mu", "comment_text": "MARK ROBER!??!", "comment_date": "2019-12-17T01:59:29Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Sk Ali", "comment_text": "Pulley system was one of my favourite subjects while studying Physics in 9th grade \ud83d\ude01", "comment_date": "2019-12-17T01:57:02Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Anonymous Baros", "comment_text": "Is there a transmission that could be built with a pulley system?

Basically Newton&#39;s Third Law: Every action has an equal and opposite reaction. ie. In a single pulley system when you exert 100lbs of pressure on one side of the pulley it exerts 100lbs of pressure on the other side of the pulley.

This gives you in effect 200lbs of pulling force and has the added side effect of putting 200lbs of pressure upon your pulley and it&#39;s attachment point. It&#39;s similar to how a lever works.

Neither use snatch blocks but both are useful if you have a length of chain or, in the case of being stuck a stout rope. Dad had taken a friend and I sledding (and wood hauling...), this is about 1966-7. He drove the old 4x4 out into a flat field that had 8&quot; of powder snow and we set off to buck some birch and do some sledding. Upon our return, we discovered that under all 4 wheels of the truck there was a thick layer of solid ice. Even trying to ease the truck into motion wasn&#39;t happening, all 4 wheels were spinning as if the truck was on a hoist. Dad pulls out a length of 1&quot; rope, tied it to the frame (separate lesson on a bowline knot) and instructed me to proceed with the other and to an anchor tree, put a wrap around it and pull it as tight as possible. He got in the truck and instructed my friend to push on the rope at the center of the line between truck &amp; tree at right angles to the line. My buddy was able to push the rope 2-3 feet moving the truck just an inch or two. Dad applied the brakes, my buddy let up on the pressure &amp; I took up the slack at the wrap at the tree. Rinse &amp; repeat until we&#39;d moved the truck a few feet where there was a little traction and we were free. This is the power of trigonometry! The force applied was my 50-60 lb. buddy on an icy surface to the rope, but the force applied (at first) to the truck was perhaps 30 lbs. / sin(~179.9999 degrees) or bunches (&gt;100,000 lbs.)! As the angle drops from ~180, the force drops rapidly too, but a hundred foot rope keeps a high angle to this point for several feet. The other mech advantage trick was using a length of stout chain (35-40 lbs. 10&#39;) bolted to a stubborn axel in an old tractor needing removal. Using the mass and momentum of the chain to yank that axel in a couple of tries.

Aka do the same work! Also you will notice that the more pulleys you add the less it does the SAME WORK as before aka it is slowly becoming just a straight lever... so it isn&#39;t actually lifting any longer it is tilting more than lifting so the motion is no longer a VECTOR UP in the vertical.... thus you see by NOT actually winding up the rope &amp; PAYING for the weight you purchased with DISTANCE you start losing the same work being done.... nothing is free!

In this case, I prefer this simple explanation - the reason that a SNATCHBLOCK works is because it significantly reduces the distance the weight is raised with each pull of the rope, thereby reducing the work required for each pull.  In physics terms, the easiest way to look at it is by using Work=Force*Distance.  If you cut the distance the weight moves in half, which a simple SNATCHBLOCK will do, then the work you must do is also cut in half.  Raising the weight then will, of course, take twice as long.

The video is interesting, but the presenter does not explain the principle behind mechanical advantage machines, which is a shame, since he has obviously put so much effort into it.<br><br><br>Pulley systems, gearboxes and levers of all types are based on a single principle. &quot;Work&quot; in equals &quot;work&quot; out. This is using the frictionless model of course, to simplify the system. Work is defined as the product of force and distance, calculated as vectors. So assume the pull direction and the rope lie in the same straight line. To calculate the amount of &quot;work&quot; done, simply multiply the force by the distance traveled. In the case of a four rope pulley the distance traveled by the pull is four times the distance traveled by the load. It just happens to also give a number to the mechanical advantage of the system. 4:1.<br><br><br><br>One rotation on the input shaft of a transmission, gives one tenth a rotation of the output shaft. The MA is 10 to 1.  For a lever, a given input force over 10 ft provides an output force over 1ft. The MA is 10:1.  It is far more useful to see MA through the lens of &quot;work&quot; done as this principle applies to ALL systems, not just ropes and pulleys.  <br><br><br>I leave you with chain blocks as a great example. You cannot see the internal workings of the machine but the gears inside reduce the number of rotations of the output shaft  compared to the number of rotations of the input shaft. You can lift a 1 ton engine block with only 20 lbs on the pull chain. That is a MA of 100:1. But look at what is happening. You pull the chain almost ten feet to raise the load only about one inch. That is: work in = work out.<br><br><br>Hope that helps!", "comment_date": "2019-12-10T18:13:40Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Wojciech W", "comment_text": "[DRINKING GAME]<br>Every time he says SNATCH BLOCK, take a glass of vodka", "comment_date": "2019-12-10T18:13:11Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "JustinP117", "comment_text": "I love watching your videos, this one was fun and funny.

They had a thing called the &quot;festoon&quot; which was probably at least 30x reduction.  When a roll of fabric would finish, they would put it in a press to start the next roll (a heated press that would cure a section of rubber to put the belt fabrics together).  During the stopped time, the hanging festoon would slowly rise from the floor with that same slow on one end and fast on the other motion.  After they would  join them, the roll would run a little quickly as the festoon made its way back down.  I NEVER got tired of watching this for the entire time I worked there!  I worked in the office, but the bathroom was across the factory floor.  I would stop and (admittedly) waste a lot of time watching this.

That the rope moves less and less through additional pulleys isn&#39;t just an idle curiosity, it&#39;s THE reason why you&#39;re getting a mechanical advantage. A single movable pulley will - assuming parallel ropes - move half the distance of your pull, which is why it will apply twice the force. It has nothing to do with the ropes being &quot;in tension&quot; beyond that&#39;s what it takes for a pulley to work, or even the number of ropes. It has to do with how much work you&#39;re doing on your end of the rope vs how much work is being done on the load end.<br><br><br>Mechanical advantage is always the same concept whether you&#39;re using a lever, a pulley, a fluid piston, a gearbox or what have you. You&#39;re either trying to do more work with less force on one end in order to get less work with more force on the other, or vice versa. Different approaches might differ in the device used, but they all employ the same principles. The principles you skipped over all but entirely in favour of saying &quot;snatch block&quot; like you&#39;re trying to summon Beetlejuice.

An interesting byproduct of a change of direction pulley demonstrated at the beginning is the force relating to the anchor.   In the first demonstration,  change of direction pulley, when the rope is pulled down you have the force to raise the weight on one side of the pulley and the weight of the object on the other side of the pulley.   The anchor must support both (double the weight), as does the pulley and rope at the turn point of the pulley. He can place the force meter on the anchor point to demonstrate this important point.   This unique engineering point comes into play when a person is lifting incorrectly using their back muscles to lift which contract over the spine, muscle and connective tissue which acts as the anchor, pulley and rope in a change of direction mode.  Lifting incorrectly not only adds the upper body weight but increases force on the spine as well by this multiplying force factor.

My first vertical cave trip (near Alabama, actually) I was getting tired climbing the last pitch and the guy up top was so excited to use his rescue pulleys I took him up on the offer. He made a 3 to one that had to be adjusted every few pulls with a secondary line that was attached to my harness (The rope wasn&#39;t long enough to double or triple over all the way down to where I was, so we had to work with that). Then I just moved my ascenders up as I was pulled to catch my progress each time he had to reset. It was really neat. I learned that day that haul systems are a lot of fun and if you have any bit of an excuse to assemble a system and use it, then heck yeah. <br><br>I was in a cave yesterday, in Georgia, and there was a room full of TONS of breakdown where we had to go through a 3D maze of boulders. There were bolts rigged around this gigantic mound of boulders and apparently if a cave rescue is required, a cave litter can&#39;t be twisted and bent enough to get through the 3D maze, so the cave rescuers will actually build a complex haul system using those bolts (with anchors removed most of the time so regular cavers don&#39;t get any ideas to unsafely rappel through the breakdown, since that&#39;s not what they&#39;re meant for, and if you&#39;re rappeling down to a part of the 3D maze, there&#39;s really no safe spot to get off rope unless you go to the very bottom, which goes no where) to haul the injured person in the litter up and over the breakdown.

The (n-1)&#39;th line will have to move at twice speed at which the weight is rising(2*v/n) since both the (n-1)&#39;th line and the n&#39;th line have gotten shorter by ds/n.  <br><br><br>In general, the (n-k)&#39;th line will move at a speed of v*(k+1)/n since each added line has to traverse an extra distance of dS/n.

In the jeep example you used, the hook is attached to the bumper and the second half of the rope is pulling on the stationary bumper with 1/2 the force but the bumper is solid so you are basically excreting an equal force against it and because the steel bumper is so strong, it can handle it, but I&#39;m still curious as to why? Does it mean my force is essentially pulling against the bumper and the bumper&#39;s rigidity is giving me the additional force? <br><br><br>I feel like i don&#39;t understand where the extra energy in the system is coming from. You can&#39;t create energy, it has to be taken from somewhere but where is the &#39;somewhere&#39;?", "comment_date": "2019-12-08T03:50:43Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Felipe Behrens", "comment_text": "Problem is, you now have to pull farther .

It takes less strength to push a ball up a ramp than to lift it over a wall. However, you have to move the ball farther to compensate, so the same energy is being used total. With a pulley, you have to pull for a larger displacement but with less force. This is why humans are genius. You&#39;d think, well same total force, no point right? Wrong. Humans are creatures of endurance not power. If a human could unlock their full strength they could lift a car. The muscle strain and tearing would probably kill them though.

Because there is no second change of direction, you only have a single change in direction, but you do have increased pulling power because there are two attachment points on the jeep. The winch itself isn&#39;t a pulley, so with one pulley you gain nothing but decreasing the load on the line, and increase the attachment points on the jeep. Is this correct?

You generated the same force with double the gear, as the tension of the rope is still the force generated by the pulling truck and the force on your truck is still ~x2. <br>You could generate x3.

A block will contain one or more sheaves, (the round spinny part) and has one or two sides to support the shaft or pin.  A block changes the direction of pull of a rope, line, or cable.<br>A pulley is a round disk of sorts, with one or more grooves, that&#39;s mounted on a shaft and either is driven by the shaft, or drives the shaft, like those spinny things that your fan belt rides on in your vehicle.  Pulleys are often used on electric motors, or gasoline engines to drive rubber V-belts, flat leather belts, or multi-groove belts.  Pulleys can also be flat pulleys, with or without a crown.  A bandsaw blade rides on 2 to 4 pulleys, called wheels.  One is driving, the others are driven.<br>And yes, I&#39;m aware that most people call anything that looks like a pulley, a pulley, but that doesn&#39;t make it a pulley.

A big part of the job involved abseiling and building these pully rigs to rescue people trapped in various places. We were trained in not just the use of the pullys but also in the physics involved. Theres a whole lot of other factors involved which can have different effects. Like the different loads placed on individual items of equipment depending how many pullys are involved, the angle that the rope leaves the pully effects the load on your anchor point, the difference between a mechanical advantage and a re-direction and ghe effect of friction force on different lengths of rope. I reccomend checking out some videos about cliff rescue etc to get a better idea.

That being a single pulley attached to the load, but with both ends of the rope suspended in the air. I.E. the load is below you and you are pulling on one end of the rope while standing on a platform that the other end of the rope is affixed to. This scenario is challenging for many students, because it looks like the pulley is just redirecting the force and not multiplying it. The similarity with having a single pulley suspended in the air which redirects the downward pulling force to an upward force (the simplest use of a pulley) on the load often confuses people. <br><br>Thanks", "comment_date": "2019-12-06T15:50:13Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "loxoler", "comment_text": "We also use this for climbing, even without a pulley it&#39;s worth it", "comment_date": "2019-12-06T15:50:06Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Nic H", "comment_text": "How many pulleys would you need in order to lift the earth up?

As an oil rig worker snatch blocks are a way of life, along with sticky situations out 4x4ing. One thing that concerned me a bit is how close you stand to the rigging when its under tension. I&#39;ve personally seen equipment fail and it can get dangerous really fast. Here&#39;s a few quick safety tips to live by when pulling/winching a vehicle out. Keep yourself out of the line of fire,  if something breaks its trajectory will be inline with the cable or rope. Always stay twice the length of your longest line away from the work (unless absolutely necessary). If you have to pull on or with the front of a vehicle the hood should be put up. A 5 pound snatch block will easily come right through your windshield however not so much the hood. And inspect your equipment before you use it. Its also a good idea to know the ratings of your equipment, identify the weak link and place it strategically in the system so that if it does fail it will cause the least damage and/or person injury.

Some questions to start with: (1) is the stress on the rope the same, no matter how many pulleys/snatch blocks you use, or does it allow you to use a weaker rope than you would need if you were pulling directly? (2) Am I correct that one of the reasons why pulleys make it easier is because of leverage?  In other words, you have  wheel spinning about an axle, and the axle is where the load is being carried.  (3) If it is leverage as I described, would a larger pulley give you greater power?  What does that do to the tension on the rope?", "comment_date": "2019-12-06T03:17:51Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "NatePlayzYT", "comment_text": "That Jeep needs new tires.", "comment_date": "2019-12-06T03:16:46Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "getmeoutofiraq05", "comment_text": "so what your saying is....SNATCH BLOCK!", "comment_date": "2019-12-06T03:15:52Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Nate B.", "comment_text": "I like how I don&#39;t understand it, but I also understand it.", "comment_date": "2019-12-06T03:15:22Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Richard Fitzwell", "comment_text": "It be easy to get that TJ stuck with those bald tires", "comment_date": "2019-12-06T03:15:20Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Chris W", "comment_text": "that thin blue rope got me sitting uneasy lol", "comment_date": "2019-12-06T03:15:14Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Jay Frias", "comment_text": "Question.

In other words, in your demonstration, you are pulling with 2 lbs of force to lift 8 lbs. Does each pulling receive 2 lbs? or does the first pulley receive 2 lbs, then the next pulley receives 4 lbs etc?  Ultimately we are trying to determine what the force is at the end of a pulley system so we can use the right size cable/ pulley system.

But then I later realized there&#39;s an easier way to interpret the situation:<br>For each pulley you include, you are halving the amount of force necessary to lift the object, because the pulley splits the weight of the load into on each side of it.  In other words, since each pulley is mounted to a fixed location, it effectively is distributing the load across the rope to each point it is mounted to.  So if you were to measure how much force is applied to each mounting point (including the hand pulling the rope), they should all read the same number, and should collectively add up to the object&#39;s actual weight.<br><br><br>This might all sound obvious to some but to me, that wasn&#39;t made totally clear.", "comment_date": "2019-12-05T23:36:51Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "God Of Timewaste", "comment_text": "If only this video came out 2 months earlier.

If it weren&#39;t for inefficiencies in your system due to stuff like friction, the amount of work you do would be exactly the same, because work = force times distance.  So if you&#39;re willing to pull the rope or push the lever for a long distance over the course of time, you can lift an aircraft carrier (or the world, if you have a place to stand, and strong enough materials to make the rope/lever out of).  This is <i>theoretically</i> fourth-grade physics, but most students (and I think most teachers for that matter) zone out (&quot;boring&quot;) and don&#39;t pay enough attention to actually understand what is going on.

The normal force provided by the ground on your feet is the weight of the block + the weight of you (assuming you lift it slowly). <br><br>2) <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2w3NZzPwOM&amp;t=5m24s\">5:24</a> that&#39;s not the reason why that side of the block moves up less quickly. If the bearings for each of your pulleys were completely frictionless you would notice the bottom block move unifromly upwards. This is because the influence of friction creates a counter torque which increases the tension in the rope on the left, and reduces the tension in the rope on the right. <br><br>Loved the video though!

The way I have always though about it is, the mechanical advantage in a block and tackle comes from the multiplication of force that manifests itself in the fact you have to move the end rope some multiple of the thing you are pulling.  For example, to get 8 times the force in a block and tackle, you need to &quot;move&quot; the end of the rope 8 times as far. The exact same way a 2 foot long wrench would exert twice the force of a 1 foot long wrench but you have to move the &quot;end&quot; of the wrench twice as far.  Simple mechanical advantage.  Its just force times distance, right??

[fulcrum short story]\u00a0 Once upon a time way out in the country a woman in a mobile home had a wheel chair ramp once belonging to a school out building delivered by five BIG guy&#39;s for free . It was slid off of a long trailer to her back door (via rollers) Once it was dropped there was no moving it by these guys [it] just weighed way too much so they wished her luck and left . It was inches away from the threshold and not high enough\u00a0 while sitting on grass and soft dirt.<br><br> Many tried and failed . Then I arrived two days later , and by myself created a fulcrum from objects nearby . i.e.\u00a0one railroad tie cut in half ,\u00a0one 4x4 twenty feet long , some small blocks , and a cinder block . With just 6&quot; of\u00a0the end of the\u00a04x4 underneath the heaviest part of the ramp I placed some blocks under the 4x4 and raised the far end\u00a0of the 20&#39; length of 4x4\u00a0about 4&#39; in the air and wedged the cinder block upright under it . <br><br>I went back to the end sticking underneath this ramp and stacked enough little blocks on top of my 4x4 to sit tight under the platform of the ramp . The two pieces of railroad tie I positioned near each corner and went back to the far end . I just removed the cinder block and with very little effort or body weight I pushed the raised end to the ground and placed the cinder block on top to hold it there \u00a0 while I slid the ties under each corner . <br><br>The ramp was high enough , all I had to do now was give it a slight shove up against the threshold and the fulcrum , the small blocks and the long board teeterd just enough for it\u00a0to slump down onto the ties in perfect position . Nobody saw how I had done it so I was a magician for a day .

If the force hung on two equally thought ropes, the force would be split by those two ropes, likewise for even more ropes. The pulleys allow you to use a single rope as multiple ropes, while also automatically distributing the force onto all the ropes equally. therefore the amount of force that gets transfered to you, is equal to the force divided by the number of ropes attached to that force. now for the final pulley that only cause a change of direction, since the rope connected to it is bearing the force divided by the number of ropes connected to the same force, by having this pulley change direction, you only feel as much force as that rope is feeling.", "comment_date": "2019-12-05T21:17:37Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "TwX EdgE", "comment_text": "I was expecting \u201cnow for our sponsor, SNATCH BLOCK\u201d", "comment_date": "2019-12-05T21:17:29Z", "likes_count": 399}, {"comment_by": "Kes22497", "comment_text": "I&#39;d been waiting for this episode ever since Destin mentioned snatch blocks on the podcast.", "comment_date": "2019-12-05T21:17:18Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Clint Rannebeck", "comment_text": "I understand there is tension throughout the rope but I still dont understand how the pulleys lessen the pull weight at one end.", "comment_date": "2019-12-05T21:16:49Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Anthony Tedjamulia", "comment_text": "Jeep&#39;s tires are BALD.

Here is a simplified version. The upper of stationary pulleys simply redirect motion. The lower or moving pulleys divide the effective motion in half starting with the first or fast line pulley, effectively doubling the pulling force with each pulley ending at the dead line. Since each moving pulley divides the range of motion in half, with respect to the previous pulley, the leverage is doubled with respect to the previous pulley. So a four pulley setup (four stationary and four moving) multiplies sixteen times while an eight pulley multiplies two hundred and fifty six times.<br>    The fascinating thing is, each line is only carrying the amount you are pulling on your end.", "comment_date": "2019-12-05T20:09:11Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Adam Rubinger", "comment_text": "Nah, you don&#39;t pull ropes you push &#39;em and that&#39;s how to prove the Earth is flat, so those should technically be called pusheys. <br><br>Look that up before you comment...

Shouldn&#39;t that be playing a huge role on the ability of the pulley to &quot;multiply force&quot;? In fact, I had thought that it was the circle that enabled the force multiplication rather than the number of ropes, which is what I understood from the video.

Using the simple model for friction you can show that with every wrap around a pulley, the tension grows exponentially. <br>2. I doubt the story about archimedese raising a ship with pulleys is true.

You explained how to make a pulley system, and how the mechanical advantage can be calculated. But why is interesting.<br><br>There&#39;s nothing magical about pulleys. <br>If you lift something with a rope, you&#39;re having to create tension in the rope until the force transmitted by the rope equals the force gravity exerts on the mass and then breaks that balance and the thing moves up, let&#39;s say one meter. <br>You generated a certain amount of force to get it one meter higher, you pulled one meter of rope. <br>The total amount of energy exerted to realize this operation is 1. (just setting it for reference).<br><br>Taking the same weight, you introduce a pulley system that has a mechanical advantage of 4. You&#39;re still creating tension in the rope, but four times less, until you break the balance and the thing starts moving up. But with this system you have to pull 4 meter of ropes to get it moving up 1 meter.<br>You generated four times less force but pulled four times as much rope. The total amount of energy exerted to realize this operation is still 1.<br><br>So, pulleys work by reducing the amount of force you have to generate, by increasing the length you have to pull.<br>For humans, it&#39;s easier to pull four times less four times further, but that doesn&#39;t require less force, and thus the law on the conservation of energy is not broken.<br>You don&#39;t multiply the force generated, you displaced the effort over longer. Sort of like payment plan with no interest, if that makes sense.<br><br>Look, i don&#39;t pretend to understand it very well, i just looked it up, if someone has a better way to explain it, feel free, if i missed anything, feel free to point it out.", "comment_date": "2019-12-05T17:11:58Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Jacob Luhn", "comment_text": "This video brought back nightmares I had after studying like crazy for statics (or dynamics, I can&#39;t remember) exams about pulleys", "comment_date": "2019-12-05T17:11:52Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Arjun Ramachandran", "comment_text": "In this video, you can see a man thoroughly enjoying what he&#39;s doing from the deepest bottom of his heart.

If you have 2 ropes attached to the ceiling they would both be under tension of 0,5kg and the ceiling supporting 1kg. If you hold one of the ropes and let the ceiling support the other one you would only need to support 0,5kg. To lift something with 1kg you would need more than 1kg of force. A pulley let you use a single rope as two and without losing the tension that&#39;s supporting the block, thus, you only need &gt;0,5kg of force to lift an 1kg object.

A Moment is marked by the letter M, the definition of a moment is a Force multiplied by an Arm. <br>Or M=F*L<br>F is the force applied to the object, like a man pulling a rope.<br>L is the Arm which is the distance from the centre of the point around which the force is applied to the point where the force is applied. <br>So we can see that the longer the distance from us to the point where we want the force to work at the bigger the moment. <br>In our case the farther away we are from the centre of the pully the bigger the moment we can apply while keeping the force the same. <br>By adding pullies we can increase our force which each one we add by getting the force it applies farther from a new centre (the added pully). If we connect them to a stable object like the roof of a box each of them is applying half of its force on the pully behind it and, half on the wall it is connected too. <br>So by either of those ways, we can increase the moment on the item we want to move without changing how hard we need to pull. <br><br>I hope this is clear and helped all who wondered. I am not a native English speaker and only in my first semester of college so this is by no way all that is happening there, but as I understand it this is it for the most part. <br>I really like that now after years of watching SmarterEveryDay and getting into engineering partly thanks to this amazing channel I can try and help others understand it better as well.", "comment_date": "2019-12-05T16:02:48Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Alberto Figueroa Arquitectura", "comment_text": "I thought snatch block was the sponsors for this video.

I tied the rope around me and went in the other direction and pulled with body weight and legs. We loaded the truck with the tree no problem. We then disassembled the snatch block and rope and put them in the truck. The guy with the tractor showed up only to find the tree already in the back of the truck. His jaw hit the floor. He asked us how we did it and I pointed to my arm. The look on his face was priceless.

For example, if you pull one meter of rope, but the weight rises of just 50 centimeters (by using just one snatch block), you are applying a force F that is just half of what would normally take, because the work done by you and the one done by gravity G must be balanced: <br><br>F * 1m = G * 0.5m;  F = 0.5G<br>Does it make sense?", "comment_date": "2019-12-05T15:57:25Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "SDR_Speedcuber", "comment_text": "Bruh...we need to snatchblock laminar flow!", "comment_date": "2019-12-05T15:57:17Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Sam M", "comment_text": "Really cool Destin", "comment_date": "2019-12-05T15:57:16Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "David Honsinger", "comment_text": "Can we get a &quot;Snatch Block&quot; Counter next time, Destin?", "comment_date": "2019-12-05T15:57:07Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "YuKonSama", "comment_text": "That was the most alabamaian interpretation of archimedes :D &quot;Yo dawg&quot;", "comment_date": "2019-12-05T15:56:56Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Vinicius Moreira", "comment_text": "what? the sponsor isn&#39;t snatch block?", "comment_date": "2019-12-05T15:56:46Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Straight Up Shots", "comment_text": "Snatch blocks are sold out on Amazon \ud83d\ude2d", "comment_date": "2019-12-05T15:56:35Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Manabender", "comment_text": "I was surprised when the sponsor wasn&#39;t snatch blocks.", "comment_date": "2019-12-05T15:56:34Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Edward Evans", "comment_text": "Fewer pulleys!", "comment_date": "2019-12-05T15:56:26Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Dennis Finkelstein", "comment_text": "Smartereveryday explotating kids since 2019", "comment_date": "2019-12-05T15:56:23Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Wallace Anderson", "comment_text": "Pulleys!", "comment_date": "2019-12-05T15:56:03Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Dekunutcase", "comment_text": "@<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2w3NZzPwOM&amp;t=1m02s\">1:02</a>, so pulling (or pulleying) a rope is always intentional?", "comment_date": "2019-12-05T15:56:03Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Gary Handasis", "comment_text": "Just a Reminder.
