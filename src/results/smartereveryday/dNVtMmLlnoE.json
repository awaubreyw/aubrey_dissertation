Tell Jesus that you are remorsefully sorry for breaking His commandments and that you are begging for forgiveness from Him.  Allow His blood from the cross to wash away your sins.  After this is done with your heart successfully the Holy Spirit will come to live within you and He will rebuild you from the inside out.  Look for signs that you are living righteously.

This was because at faster exposures than that, the entire film surface was NEVER exposed during the shot.  At 1/1000 second exposure times the actual area exposed was just a traveling slit about 1/8th, give or take,  of the entire film area as a moving slit, with the light blocking part of the shutter following the light allowing part pretty closely behind, starting to move LONG before the opening shutter hit it&#39;s far stop.  Since you were really just allowing the majority of the light in from the flash (dark photography),  you would have just exposed the slit part that was open during the flash, which is short by comparison, and not the entire area of the film.

So instructive! It&#39;s so interesting to observe this effect and somehow trying to transpose it&#39;s &quot;wowness&quot; to the physics of light and time and gravity. Rolling shutter effect should be studied in schools, I feel it could give kids a rich and stimulating perception of what time is and why the stars we see in the sky are likely to be dead... millions of years ago. <br>I love it&#39;s results in photography!

So, I think it would be cool if you would set up an experiment where you put a few people to the test and let them tell you when they see this fenomenon in real time.

Although many tutorials teach that we should train many hours until the brain could get used to. The speed of the scroll bar, I always wondered if because of the speed there would be no distortions on the computer screen. I could never confirm these distortions. I took the bible in PDF format and clicked at the end of the scroll bar. In about 12 minutes the entire Bible had passed before my eyes. I thought if I repeated this several times for days, in a few years I could read entire Bible-sized books in just a few minutes. But the doubt about the issue of deformations on the computer screen discouraged me and I stopped exercising. Could you perform this test on a computer screen using the bible or any other book in PDF format and use the scroll bar to make it scroll over the screen very quickly and capture the images for distortions? I would be immensely grateful and believe that this experiment would greatly help to revolutionize the exercises of dynamic reading and memorization. And another step would be to use this camera to somehow shoot a range of a few millimeters of pages and then try to reproduce the images at high speed. To see the difference.

The plane with the moving propeller exists in 3 dimensions and a 4th dimension of time.

What the rolling shutter does for us is skew that cross section in the time dimension.  If you take a 2d cross section of a cube, you will get a square, but if you skew it, you may end up with a rectangle, or a triangle, or even a hexagon.  The shape of the cross section looks less and less like the object it projects the more you skew it.  Similarly, when you take a skewed 3d cross section of a fast-spinning propeller, it starts to bend and even fragment.  One may look at the image of the fragments and ask how is that possible - the fragments are not connected to the hub?

The top row of pixels are captured first at some initial position. As you go down the rows of pixels the camera moves leftward in the scene, and the background moves rightward relative to the initial position, and so all the following rows are captured with the appearance of having moved to the right of the initial row of pixels.

At certain  shutter speeds it behaved somewhat as a rolling shutter. The shutter consisted of overlapping panels, with one panel opening the aperture followed by the second panel closing it by moving in the same direction.  For very short exposures this would form a slit passing across the focal plane just above the film itself.  <br>For film, with its always low ISO numbers it seldom had any effect, as the first shutter would completely open before the second began to close. Holding the camera steady was the problem and the propellers you show would just disappear in blur of motion for a properly photographed image. That rolling shutter has a great deal to do with  modern digital imaging systems ability to at least be sharp enough to suit average users despite the occasionally odd shapes of fast moving objects within the frame.", "comment_date": "2017-06-30T16:46:58Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Marco Lopes", "comment_text": "Awesome.", "comment_date": "2017-06-30T16:46:03Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "EMOTIONLESS 6981", "comment_text": "so thats why fidget spinnera do this thing on a camera ..", "comment_date": "2017-06-30T16:45:14Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "kalle", "comment_text": "Oro My gad", "comment_date": "2017-06-30T16:45:07Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Zach Wiggin", "comment_text": "Your video quality just keeps going up!
