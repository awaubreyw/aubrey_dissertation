Jet Hot for a summer and I did everything from blasting the old coating, burnishing for Satin Finish, Finishing which was a tub of water and glass beads to get a chrome finish, hanging the parts on racks for the oven and packing. We used the same foam for packing. We would put plastic down and spray the liquid in and it would expand as it cooled. It\u2019s the perfect way to package parts. The only thing I didn\u2019t do was paint. And I\u2019m glad I didn\u2019t paint. They had to be in a heated room we called the barn. Then slide the parts in the oven and bake the coating on at 650 degrees F. It was very hot in the building, usually around 120 - 130 degrees depending on when the oven was opened. I ended up with a kidney stone after I stopped working there. They did coat other things but I worked on the car parts side. The company shut down in the 2000\u2019s as header companies started offering ceramic coated parts to customers. It was an experience. My friends roommate in college from Memphis had a Jet Hot magnet on his fridge. His dad had gotten a header coated while I was working there for his Viper. It was very cool. Thanks for the tour.

I love the whole carburetor tangent you got off into.  I have a suggestion for the next video if you want to push the carb series for another video.  What you saw being built was an off-the-shelf bolt on carb for a stock or mildly modified engine.  You should really see what race carb builders do to these stock carbs.  You would be surprised and what is possible using a stock casting.  Dirt track racers run those 4412 500cfm 2 barrels on 600 horsepower engines and make em sing.  You&#39;re a math man and love a good spread sheet (as do I), check out the CFM and fuel requirements for 600 horsepower and then think about getting all of that through 1 500cfm 2 barrel carb.  Methanol requires nearly twice as much fuel.  One thing you missed about the stock carb is the power valve.   The power valve radically changes the fuel curve depending on your camshaft dynamics.  You could spend an entire night watching vidoes on power valves.. which one to use for what application, when it&#39;s okay to delete them.. so much nerdy gear head fun.  Love the series man.

Finally something I can relate to, both from having to have my Holley&#39;s constantly adjusted, but not from the standpoint of being able to do it myself.

We threw a clutch out at least every two weeks or so, and the car generated about 750HP, and won every race we were in, though nearly losing to a Challenger.  This was street racing in 1978 or so, in New Mexico.  I bought the car from an Air Force pilot, whose wife insisted he get rid of it.  I had a lot of latitude to race on the weekends, even though in-town, on a very nice, but isolated road.  It was for stakes, and my army and air force buddies footed the labor bills while I bought most of the parts.  Hate to admit it, but they did not want me to drive it in most races.  I was not good enough, and I did not argue with them as they were the only reason I could keep the vehicle in top shape. \u00a0<br><br>Sorry, I had to put that all down eventually in my life, I was inspired by your video - and this excellent tour of where my carburetors were made nearly a half century ago.  The car could top out at about 151 by the way, but it wanted to explode at that speed.  It turned 10.2 in the quarter back then.  Just had to write that too so I can look at it again someday.

That is Holley&#39;s main claim to fame.  Often the secondary bores are much larger than the primaries (termed &quot;spread-bore&quot;), which gives more efficiency in normal driving where the smaller primary bores are used.  The one shown has the same size primaries and secondaries (termed &quot;square-bore&quot;).  It also has &quot;mechanical secondaries&quot;, meaning they open via the pedal.  It is closer to the original Carter Aluminum Four-Barrel (AFB) of the 1960&#39;s, whose descendant is today&#39;s Edelbrock used by many classic owners for lower cost and simplicity.  Others of note are the Carter Thermoquad (many Mopars) and Rochester Quadrajet (many GM), which were the last-gasp designs before the electronic feedback carbs of the early 1980&#39;s.  Both had secondaries which open via air-flow (&quot;as needed&quot;), unless you floored-it to force them open which could bog down the engine.  Both were spread-bore with tiny primaries, so gave better mileage in normal driving.<br><br>Some fuel injections systems had similar ideas to the carburetor.  Throttle Body Injection (TBI) had a similar single throttle body, but a high pressure pump delivered fuel, for a finer spray, and electronics calculated and controlled the required fuel rather than venturi effects.  One interesting system was the Bosch L-Jetronic (1981-91 on many Euro cars) which had an &quot;air plate&quot; similar to Thermoquad and Quadrajet,  but controlled fuel flow from a high-pressure pump, feeding a mechanical fuel distributor to a spray nozzle at each cylinder.", "comment_date": "2021-08-26T21:21:09Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "boots and boxers", "comment_text": "Now do a an ogle carburetor", "comment_date": "2021-08-26T21:18:15Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Leandro Xiscatti", "comment_text": "Another amazing video!<br>for people complaining about the other video, yes Destin made a simplyfied carburetor, summarized to its basic principles , what he didn&#39;t do was a complex carburetor!", "comment_date": "2021-08-26T21:11:50Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Phoboz", "comment_text": "And this kids, is why we stopped using ICE engines and went with the much simpler electric motor vehicles.", "comment_date": "2021-08-26T21:06:42Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "G3NK5T42", "comment_text": "What is a floppy-do?

Personally I would prefer something slightly less excessive - like I said these companies treat their customers like idiots who can&#39;t hear the difference between good audio and better audio.

The manufacturers just overcomplicate things on purpose so, you have to come back, and buy the carburetors from them. We can have simplified carburetors that work basically the same, and can be fixed easily by the owners, but where is the manufacturers profit?<br>   Anything obviously made by a manufacturer that is complicated means, you&#39;ll have to order from them again. This makes the manufacturer go into a overproduction mode. Overproduction makes me as nervous as overpopulation. We live in a country that allows these things to consistently happen without a resolution being purposed and tested, before the negative affects of these things happening, that will cause irreversible damage. (Like radium pills)<br>    If we the people, that make up this country and planet, don&#39;t make plans for a difference now, to alleviate the extensive damage done; we will be paying the consequences a lot longer than reaping the benefits, even more so than we do today (which is a scary thought).<br>    A lot of people know this yet, things still stay relatively the same, and in some cases worse; like the overproduction of lithium.<br>   This has caused massive electronic waste piles destroying our landfills, many properties around them, and surrounding towns. For example, overproduction leads people to believe they are getting great deals ordering from Chinese websites, to save 2$ on your next game controller; when in reality, all the old controllers, and new ones that don&#39;t sell, are thrown away so easily. This all leads to overly-polluted areas, once again, in our country the US of A, as well as many other counties, including your own reading this now. <br>   China used to have the #1 most polluted water ways in the world but now just falls short of India. Electronic waste is one of the #1 reasons for largely polluted areas, as well as, farm run-off, and toxic waste dumped by all of our governments, and their contractors.<br>    I have ideas to make a difference and I&#39;m sure others do too, I have seen a <b>few</b> proactive people as well. However, not nearly enough. I just wish those ideas of people and ways to contribute to the sustainability of our home planet, appeared in my recommendations more than Stevewilldoit destroying his mom&#39;s house, and giving her money after, or Mr.Beast eating more Gold covered food because he can.

Carbs can have performance issues if there is any gunk or foreign material coating a part or clogging a passageway which is why ethanol/gasoline blends are trouble and they periodically need to be disassembled and cleaned for best results.   They can still deliver performance close to EFI but have simple reliability once they are correctly set for an application.   In WW2 carburetors in Spitfire and Mustang went up against the mechanical fuel injection German engines and the two systems according to Stanley Hooker at RR were a dead heat in effectiveness in supercharged engines.  Specifically because the Merlin engine had superchargers that sucked the fuel/air out of the carburetor and mixed them completely and fully evaporated the gasoline so it was delivered to each cylinder as a vapor/air mixture that combusted efficiently.

I came into this industry about 15 years after Electronic Fuel Injection started to take off. <br><br>I learned how to tune a carb engine in College at Wallace State. We actually got my 1971 Ford F100 300ci 6 to achieve about 28mpgs with a 3 speed. I was impressed by Fred Shockley&#39;s knowledge. <br><br>I can tell you why Fuel Injection took over. <br><br>Laziness. People didn&#39;t want to pay to tune up their cars. And Emissions standards. Those 2 reasons killed the carb on your mass produced vehicles. <br><br>I&#39;d also like to add why I prefer Fuel injection over traditional carb on my &quot;racecars&quot; .... <br><br>Once a carb is set, and the distributor is locked down, that&#39;s basically what you have. The AF ratio and timing curve is basically set. <br><br>With Fuel Injection I can adjust timing and AF ratios pretty much infinitely, and by RPM. <br><br>This is why we have a flatter HP/TQ curve on today&#39;s performance engines. And.... now we have VVT so we can also sweep the cam to a degree to achieve maximum performance from an engine. Think &quot;VTEC&quot; from Honda. All modern V8 engines have these benefits. <br><br>Carbs are cool, and they can make great power numbers, but Fuel Injection allows us to have more power &quot;under the curve&quot; across the RPM usable range, with better reliability, and cleaner Emissions. <br><br>I enjoy watching your videos and we aren&#39;t far apart, I&#39;m in Arab to your south, and I&#39;ve really enjoyed this series. <br><br>Smarter everyday. \ud83c\uddfa\ud83c\uddf2", "comment_date": "2021-08-22T09:33:33Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "George T.", "comment_text": "Fascinating.

Most automotive engines normally have around 18&quot; of vacuum at idle, as the throttle is only slightly open, causing an air restriction.  it immediately drops to about 5&quot; inches under normal acceleration or cruise, and almost zero under hard accel.

That relationship stays constant, as the float just keeps the needle pushed into its seat, thereby closing off the fuel inlet.  On a Holley, you&#39;re moving the entire needle/seat assembly upward or downward to adjust fuel level.

There have also been cases in which the incubation period extends beyond 14 days and the infected patients show no symptoms, making it harder to stem the virus&#39; spread.\r<br>\r<br>Another challenge is the lack of preventive vaccines or therapeutic drugs. Although a number of companies are working or planning to work on it, the outcome remains uncertain. Remdesivir, a new drug made by Gilead Sciences, for example, is expected to work only on mild or moderate cases. The lengthy drug approval process may also mean that even before a drug is put on the market, the quick spread and mutation of the virus may have made it beyond treatment.\r<br>\r<br>Some hope that the epidemic would fade like SARS as the temperature rises, but there is no evidence yet. \u201cWe absolutely don\u2019t know that,\u201d says Trudie Lang at the University of Oxford. \u201cI keep asking virologist colleagues this and nobody knows.\u201d\r<br>\r<br>Millions of people are placed under quarantine as the Chinese communist regime scrambles to contain the virus. With no end of quarantine in sight, many, especially those in Wuhan, feel trapped in their own homes, and their mental health is worrisome, which may lead to another humanitarian crisis.\r<br>\r<br>As China&#39;s leaders grapple with the epidemic and its devastating impact on the economy and people&#39;s physical and psychological well-being, I am writing this open letter to share my understanding of the plague. I hope that they will learn from history and find a solution that addresses the fundamental, underlying causes of the epidemic.\r<br>\r<br>Plagues in Ancient Times\r<br>A lot can be learned from plagues in the ancient times, whether in China or in the West. During the Ming Dynasty, for example, a plague broke out in 1580 and infected more than half of the families in Datong (in today\u2019s Shanxi Province), and it later spread to Beijing as well as southern China. When it broke out again in Shanxi Province in 1633, many people fled and some families had no survivors. Another surge of the plague in 1641, three years before the dynasty\u2019s end, wiped out a significant portion of the population in China.\r<br>\r<br>Besides plagues, the Ming Dynasty also faced other threats, such as the rebelling forces from Li Zicheng (also known as the Dashing King). The plagues, though, seemed to infect only the Ming Dynasty\u2019s troops, not soldiers of Li Zicheng or the invading Manchus. Moreover, after infecting China for decades and weakening the Ming forces, the plague diminished in 1644 after the Manchu established the Qing Dynasty. To some extent, this plague seemed to be a catalyst for the transition of dynasties.\r<br>\r<br>In the West, the plagues in the Roman Empire were also well known in history. After Nero began to persecute Christians, several major plagues took place: the Autumn Plague in 65 AD, the Antonine Plague (165-180), the Plague of Cyprian (250-270), and the Plague of Justinian (541-542).\r<br>\r<br>During the Antonine Plague, for example, there were up to 2,000 deaths a day in Rome. With a mortality rate of about 25%, the total deaths were estimated at five million. The disease killed as much as one-third of the population in some areas and weakened the Roman army, ending a relatively peaceful period of Roman history.\r<br>\r<br>The plagues stopped miraculously after people awakened in 680 and began to reflect on the cruelty against Christians as well as the general moral decay of society. In 680, Roman citizens carried the bones of Saint Sebastian (256-288, killed during the persecution by Diocletian) and processed through the streets. As people repented of their wrongdoings, the plague miraculously vanished in Rome.\r<br>\r<br>People in other areas of the empire heard about this and followed their example, asking for the bones of Saint Sebastian to offer repentance. When a plague broke out in Venice in 1575, about 50,000 people died. Similarly, a plague occurred in Lisbon in 1599. In both cases, people marched with the bones of holy people in repentance, and the plagues ended.\r<br>\r<br>Origin of the Coronavirus Outbreak\r<br>So how did the coronavirus epidemic start in Wuhan? One theory pointed to a seafood market in Wuhan, but the first documented COVID-19 cases had never been to the seafood market. Attention was soon turned to China\u2019s only Biosafety Level 4 microbiology lab in the Wuhan Institute of Virology, known as the National Biosafety Laboratory and equipped to handle deadly coronaviruses, Ebola, and other pathogens.\r<br>\r<br>The New York Post published an article on February 22, 2020, warning its readers, \u201cDon\u2019t buy China\u2019s story: The coronavirus may have leaked from a lab.\u201d The article noted, \u201cthe People\u2019s Liberation Army\u2019s top expert in biological warfare, a Maj. Gen. Chen Wei, was dispatched to Wuhan at the end of January to help with the effort to contain the outbreak.\u201d Chen is an expert who has studied SARS, Ebola, and anthrax. The report pointed out, \u201cThis would not be her [Chen&#39;s] first trip to the Wuhan Institute of Virology either, since it is one of only two bioweapons research labs in all of China.\u201d\r<br>\r<br>Whatever the theories are, the outcome of the epidemic is disastrous to China. So many people are dying, and the economy is suffering badly.\r<br>\r<br>While people are venting their distrust in the government and calling for a change of the system, I believe there is a deeper reason for everything.\r<br>\r<br>History Has the Answer\r<br>Much like the plagues in ancient Rome that occurred after Nero began to persecute Christians, I believe that the fundamental reason for the coronavirus outbreak is the Chinese communist regime&#39;s persecution of Falun Gong practitioners.\r<br>\r<br>Falun Gong, a meditation system based on the principles of Truthfulness-Compassion-Forbearance, has enabled millions of its practitioners to improve both health and character since its introduction to the public in 1992. Its main teachings, Zhuan Falun, has been translated into 40 languages, and people in more than 100 countries practice the spiritual discipline.\r<br>\r<br>As more and more people were drawn to Falun Gong, Jiang Zemin launched a nationwide campaign against the practice in July 1999. The scale and severity of the persecution are unprecedented.\r<br>\r<br>In the past 20 years, numerous practitioners have been arrested, detained, imprisoned, tortured, or even had their organs harvested. More than 4,300 are confirmed to have died as a result of the persecution. Due to the communist regime&#39;s information blockade, the actual death toll is likely to be much higher.\r<br>\r<br>Jiang\u2019s policy of \u201cdefaming their [Falun gong practitioners\u2019] reputation, bankrupting them financially, and destroying them physically\u201d is no less severe than what Nero did to Christians.\r<br>\r<br>One plague after another struck Rome after the persecution of Christians began. If history is any indication, could the current coronavirus outbreak be a hint from heaven to warn against the persecution of Falun Gong practitioners, which has entered its 21st year in 2020?", "comment_date": "2021-08-21T21:46:51Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "belacy87", "comment_text": "Destin with the Xhibit reference ftw", "comment_date": "2021-08-21T21:45:55Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Anton Leimbach", "comment_text": "Holley makes some banging carbs.

I can link to my research that gives a couple more links, that will inevitably lead you to even more searching and hopefully end up with you actually finding a concrete answer. For a lot of people, this is pure voodoo, but for others it is competitive fact that they apply to everything they race. I did try this, and my results seemed to follow what I read was supposed to happen.

But there&#39;s one reason to be wary of them in the modern world - ethanol fuel. Since they store fuel at atmospheric pressure, sitting around for any length of time can let the more volatile elements evaporate and leave the additives behind to clog jets and passages. Fuel stabilizer helps, but it&#39;s a constant concern for anything you don&#39;t drive and refill frequently. The smaller the engine the bigger problem it is. Fuel injectors and pumps keep the gas under pressure which prevents it from evaporating, but the ethanol can cause other problems too.

This time i feel compelled to give you a little insite. My first Holly carb was a 750 double pump, in 1973. Since then many Hollys have topped various engines i have had. I hope to speak from wisdom i have gained from miles and miles of mechanicing, first be very aware these are mechanical devices incapable of cognasent thought. Everything they do are by set mechanical parameters. Today auto manufacturers have gone to injectors to fuel thier engines which when controled by a computer becomes very efficient, which is another video you may think about. Now Hollys are the easyest for me because there not complicated and easy to repair when broken, open a old &quot;motors manual &quot; look up all the other voodoo stuff that has been made, thats why there used to be mechanics instead of auto techs, no computers diagnosed a carburetor, timming, dwell, cam duration etc, etc, etc. I was writing this before the end of your video,  cant wait for the injector one to come out.

Another suggestion:  Explore how the carb transitions between circuits.  You would love the fluid dynamics part.  For example, the accelerator pump:  The reason you need that is because when the butterfly valve (throttle) is closed, you have a fair bit of vacuum drawing fuel through the carb into the engine, but when you step on it, the valve opens and your vacuum momentarily goes to zero, right when you need more fuel.  The accelerator pump takes care of that by squirting fuel directly into the engine.  Without it, you couldn&#39;t go to full throttle without a huge stumble.   Side note:  this is why people pump the throttle before starting.  The fuel in the accelerator pump is squirted into the engine which acts like a primer which also squirts fuel in for the starting phase.", "comment_date": "2021-08-21T14:11:52Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "alan connelly", "comment_text": "Awesome video and a leaned a few things.

Newer computerized, fuel-injection tech is a technical marvel, but the relative simplicity of an old-fashioned carburetor is something that is great to grow up seeing.  <br><br>I started driving in a 70&#39;s model Toyota, despite it being 20 years my senior. It may have been a fickle beast that had it&#39;s moods and ups-and-downs.

Rebuilt the carb as a teenager and going hands-on with virtually all the same components shown in this video of a modern-designed one really was a treat. Something you can learn a lot from just tinkering with it. All the smaller pieces performing a precise ballet to work in sync and let specific amounts of fuel and air into the engine based on the engine&#39;s need and response to the driver input (throttle).  <br><br>Most notable difference between that older model and this modern equivalent I can spot was in the automatic choke.   The one on that Toyota was a much simpler style that, still using a coiled bi-metalic spring, flowed heated water (Coolant) from the radiator system to &#39;sense&#39; the Engine operating temperature and open the choke slowly as the engine warmed up.

An electrically-heated bimetallic strip slowly closing the choke essentially functions as a simple timer influenced by ambient temperature.  It lacks the ability to compensate for further complicating factors like throttle position, engine load state, and so forth.  This is where fuel injection using oxygen sensors for feedback shines.  <br><br>Consider that in a car&#39;s duty cycle, warm up happens almost every time the engine is started.  Short trips and cold weather can mean that a car spends more time in warm up than at a nominal 210F oil temperature.  The imprecision of the choke hampers the carburetor&#39;s ability to maintain the correct stoichiometric ratio during this phase, no matter how carefully the air and fuel metering are machined. <br><br>This imprecision is largely responsible for the stink of a carbureted vehicle&#39;s exhaust the first few miles it drives.  We&#39;ve all been at a stoplight behind an old truck running so rich that you could smell the hydrocarbons spewing from the exhaust.  Now, there are other culprits such as spark quality and advance, poor valve and piston ring sealing from an aging engine, etc. that can aggravate this condition, but faulty mixture is the original sin.  If everyone still drove carbureted vehicles with our expanding population, catalytic converters would last a few years max, and the air in places like LA, Phoenix, SLC would be so noxious as to be basically unfit for respiration.", "comment_date": "2021-08-21T08:43:47Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "EpicName", "comment_text": "Idk if you know bur at <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1_hFKRDDP_o&amp;t=23m20s\">23:20</a>...

All the crucial functions still exist, but over a greater span. You have a metering device for airflow and for fuel (Mass airflow and fuel injectors). But, unlike carburetors, fuel injection is more flexible across the range and even compensates for altitude. Carburetors on V8 engines are designed for ranges of airflow, from 500 to 1000CFM, and you buy the size that fits your engine. Fuel injection can be tweaked by software and injector sizes, without much need to swap out other parts of the system. Plus, turbochargers work easier with EFI than with carbs. The biggest reason we have fuel injection is for efficiency. And, unlike a carb, the fuel system can momentarily shut off when fuel is not necessary, like coasting downhill or to a stop. It also precisely regulates the air/fuel ratio many times per second to maintain the optimal ratio per demand, without wasting excess fuel. Carbs are fine for hot rods, but fuel injection is better for the environment. A carburetor cannot compensate for a dirty air filter or climbing a 6,000ft mountain. But, like your tour guide said, they&#39;re simple to fix on the side of the road and parts are cheap and readily available at any part store.
