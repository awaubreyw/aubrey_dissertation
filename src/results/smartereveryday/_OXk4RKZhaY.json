But no, it &quot;lost interest&quot; and &quot;locked up all the researches&quot; and &quot;lost the data&quot; and &quot;now try to figure out how to do the same thing they did in 1960s, with the technologies of 2020!&quot;\r<br>\r<br>Think with logic.

With our technological and historical perspective, if we do not realize it is fake, we are just being pretentious.  First, in the age of bulky diode tubes, how could that little landing module engages in REAL TIME SIGNAL PROCESSING for sending massive data from moon to moon orbit to earth?  Do you know that in this time and age where Integrated Circuit could fit billions of transistors in a circuit board,  our signal processing from deep space is still very sluggish at best.  The moon landers and mars landers are at best sending out pictures and we just stick them together for viewing.  And in 1960s, with nothing but diode tubes, we managed to have extensive REAL TIME BROACASTING from moon surface.  <br><br>Second, the moon is still having 1/6 of the earth gravity.  It is almost impossible to jam pack enough explosive onto a LANDING MOON MODULE, so it could shoot the heavy, life supporting ascending module back to the 300 miles up moon orbit.  <br><br>Third, by the end of the moon landing era, the success rate was so high that astronauts were playing golfs and having moon rover car chase.  It is almost like a walk in the backyard.  And then out of nowhere, with such an advanced technology that shine through history, it is shut down.  Like nothing happened.  And the technology is gone!   This is totally contradicting to how technology and history works.  If US have such an advanced technology, it would have land on the moon once a decade to assert its domination on the world.  The cost is really small compared to the propaganda costs in any form and shape!  Nope!  It is shut down.

Of all Smarter Everyday videos you have ever done so far or at least that I have seen, this one is my favorite if not the most meaningful. It was so special getting to talk to Wayne Otteinger (I hope I spell his name right). The fruits of so such R&amp;D in the form of knowledge, understanding and comprehension of the why and wherefore that came at such a high cost of patience, perseverance, time, energy, etc., has been taken from us by NASA and by government in so many ways ranging from no longer pursuing the goals within our reach, to dumbing down the general level of intellect in our society. Mr. Otteinger I&#39;m sure answered honestly when he said that engineers of his generation weren&#39;t better than ours, but I still disagree with him on that point. Certainly scientists of his generation were better. If scientists and engineers today didn&#39;t have the shoulders of Mr. Otteinger&#39;s generation to stand on, if our generation had to start off from zero knowledge of astrophysics and had only the same tools that his generation had (e.g. no Matlab, no Solidworks, etc.), our generation would not have the low-level problem solving dexterity, the patience, the perseverance, the dedication, and the ability to see monumental challenges as a series of simple fundamental mathematical measurements and  problems be solved. If finding the answer isn&#39;t as simple as taking the variables and entering them into a computer to be modeled and simulated I have my doubts whether or not scientists and engineers of our era would be ready and able to solve those problems with mere pencil, paper, slide rule, and classical applied engineering. We would get tired of trying, throw up our hands and find something &quot;more interesting&quot; to do like play stupid video games. The brain drain here in the western world (which I could write for hours about) is perhaps the greatest casualty and tragedy of what has happened to us as a society.", "comment_date": "2021-02-14T15:02:11Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "bopaliya harshal", "comment_text": "Hi i am Mathematican this is my number theory (1) 21-12=9 (2) 321-123 = 198 = 9 + 189 (3) 4321-1234 = 3087 = 198+ 2889 = 9 + 189 + 2889 (4) 54321 - 12345 = 41976 = 3087 + 38889 = 198 + 2889 + 38889 = 9 + 189 + 2889 + 38889 (5) 654321-123456 = 530865 =  41976 + 488889 = 3087 + 38889 +  488889 = 198 + 2889 + 38889 + 488889= 9 + 189 + 2889 + 38889 + 488889 (6)7654321-1234567=6419754=530865+ 5888889 = 530865 + 41976 + 488889 = 3087 + 38889 +  488889 + 5888889 = 198 + 2889 + 38889 + 488889 + 5888889= 9 + 189 + 2889 + 38889 + 488889 + 5888889 (7)87654321-12345678=75308643=6419754 + 68888889 =  530865+5888889 + 68888889 =41976 + 488889 + 5888889 +68888889 =3087 + 38889 +  488889 + 5888889 + 68888889= 198 + 2889 + 38889 + 488889 + 5888889 + 68888889= 9 + 189 + 2889 + 38889 + 488889 + 5888889 + 68888889 (8)987654321-123456789= 864197532 =75308643 + 788888889 =6419754 + 68888889 + 788888889=  530865+5888889 + 68888889 + 788888889 = 41976 + 488889 + 5888889 +68888889 + 788888889 = 3087 + 38889 +  488889 + 5888889 + 68888889 + 788888889= 198 + 2889 + 38889 + 488889 + 5888889 + 68888889 + 788888889 = 9 + 189 + 2889 + 38889 + 488889 + 5888889 + 68888889 + 788888889 plz tell me which website i publish this ??", "comment_date": "2021-02-14T12:46:20Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Maranatha", "comment_text": "Opened this video after two weeks and only just noticed the intro music.

Every maneuver u perform in its SOI has to be performed with utmost precision or u&#39;ll end up over- or undershooting stuff big time real quick! Also, due to its small size and low gravity it&#39;s not a spherical body, but looks more like a huge asteroid.<br><br>All these things combined once led to a crash landing where Gilly had rotated far enough to no longer present the same surface at the same angle and my impatience had led to me time-warping beyond the point where I would&#39;ve needed to fire up my really wimpy engine to slow down enough for touchdown, so I had to change my trajectory dramatically to avoid crashing into the surface, leading to 1 of the situations I described in the first sentence. Fortunately I managed to slow down enough before touchdown that nothing broke from the impact but I still landed sideways.

Manned missions are exciting in a very human way, people get happy that &quot;we&quot; did it, even if they personally did nothing (maybe except paying taxes to fund that), but they cost so much money. Robotic missions do so much more science for the same amount of money, and engineers are getting better at building robots - fast. And remote sensing gets better as well. In the times of Apollo program arguably humans were really needed to do science on site, not so much today.<br>2. If the Americans taxpayers decide to go for manned mission for achievement sake, better forget the Moon and go to Mars directly. It is a bit like climbing Mt. Everest - the first few climbers were huge success, later they had to create artificial achievements on top of that - without oxygen, in winter, naked... errr... the last one is still free to take. It has little sense to go to the Moon again, IMO.<br>3. Manned mission to Mars would do useful science - but IMO much more about human travel in space, which may be beneficial on a much, much longer timescale. As for planetary science, manned mission will explore one spot on Mars surface for a few weeks or months - for that amount of money it would be possible to send hundreds if not thousands robotic missions and explore that many spots of different geology (areology?) for years, and understand Mars much, much better.<br><br>BTW. thanks for the historical insight and great interview.", "comment_date": "2021-02-03T15:33:52Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "jon lambert", "comment_text": "Thank you  you opie looking cooter sounding breath of fresh air.

The flying bedstead.  It&#39;s the absolute favourite of mine, of all the training equipment that was used in the Apollo programme.  Neil was never blamed for punching out as far as I know, but this is the first time I heard the real reason for the incident.  I knew it was because Neil had lost the ability to control the attitude of the craft, but did NOT know that it was because he&#39;d been allowed to run out of oxidiser pressure.  I&#39;d always assumed it was a purely control (computer/electronic) issue.<br><br>Mr Ottinger is also being very gracious about modern engineers, but I have to say they did things in those days with so very little and they made it work. I&#39;m truly in awe because things that we take for granted now were extremely difficult and cost millions if not billions of dollars back then.  For example the AGC was essentially a four bit computer that was cutting edge technology at the time.  I&#39;m pretty sure that a 2021 16 bit microcontroller which you can buy today for about $2 with a clock speed of 16MHz (as opposed to 1MHz) is actually far more powerful and has several hundred times more RAM.

I&#39;ve often thought that a lesser known but immensely fascinating aspect of gliding is mountain wave soaring, where gliders can use the rising air in the standing waves that form in the atmosphere in the lee of mountains in strong wind conditions. Learning to fly in wave conditions is a great example for me that knowledge =/= understanding, since it&#39;s all very well to know that air will be going up or down in a certain place based on clouds and other indicators but the complete understanding of why the air behaves like it does is less tangible. You might have heard of the Perlan Project, which reached around 76,000ft of altitude using these waves in South America.

As an engineer, I wonder if the average viewer could follow along with some of the technical jargon.

So they took some of the jet engine pressure and routed it to nozzles to counteract that rotational inertia. A clever and efficient use of fuel.

One of their first projects was a lunar lander / hopper to compete for the Ansari X-prize where much of the early engineering was open sourced with ERPS members and others on forums and groups. While the 1/6th gravity simulation was never really solved, (I believe armadillo used a crane with a tension spool), I had honestly never thought about that particular problem prior to that project, and it really affected me, left me awestruck at engineering challenges they overcame 50 years prior, just for the lander itself, let alone the 50 million other challenges involved with putting humans on the moon and bringing them back alive.<br><br>We look back at history&#39;s greatest feats of engineering and usually tge focus falls to the great pyramids, modern skyscrapers, the 3 gorges dam, etc, but by far, if you really look at all of the previously unknown challenges that were solved, technologies that had to be invented as part of the process, putting people on the moon was by far, the greatest feat of engineering in human history, probably multiple orders of magnitude more complicated than the next feat beneath it, and I doubt we&#39;ll ever have to do something as complicated without the prior engineering experience again.<br><br>When people refer to them as the greatest generation, it isn&#39;t hyperbole... I genuinely believe that ONLY the generation that grew out of out-fighting, out-engineering, out-producing and beating the axis powers in WW2 could have saw something so impossible as putting a man on the moon in 8 years when we had only just managed to launch a man into suborbital flight, as not only feasible, but they actually did it.", "comment_date": "2021-01-30T20:47:04Z", "likes_count": 2}, {"comment_by": "Mr Spicy Ravioli", "comment_text": "It&#39;s been a minute.
