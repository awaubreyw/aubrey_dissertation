Anyway, onto my point: They have 2 kinds. Electronic and not. I prefer the non-electronic, but I also like its sibling. Nonelectronic can be swung around like normal, but when you go to &quot;store&quot; it, it will actually &#39;fold&#39; in all the way, so you can have just the hilt. But they don&#39;t have the light emission. The electronic ones have light emission, but they don&#39;t have the ability to be &#39;folded&#39; all the way down, I assume b/c batteries, lighting unit, and sound emitters. But, I mean, if you use fiber optic and something about the size of that laser pointer (Maybe replace the laser emitter with a small round LED :P) then perhaps that could make it so they could be retracted completely.<br>Also, side note, I&#39;ve never liked sound emitters in my toys.

So, the angle is not under the angle of incidence, but over the critical angle. The angle made by the light beam wrt the normal is called the angle of incidence.\r<br><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUwVZUOSTvk&amp;t=11m27s\">11:27</a> the beam shouldn&#39;t get lighter and lighter as you point the beam up more. When you are pointing the beam up more and more, you are actually decreasing the angle of incidence (wrt normal). Now, at all angles greater than the critical angle, all light reflects, so there shouldn&#39;t be a change in the intensity as you keep tilting the laser, until after the angle of incidence, when light starts coming out. Even then, a portion of the light is reflected into the lake, it&#39;s just too faint to notice. Thus technically, the light coming out of the lake will increase in intensity as you point the beam more upwards; but this happens only after passing the critical angle.", "comment_date": "2020-07-25T10:05:49Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Eddie Kuzmenko", "comment_text": "Thank you so much for taking the time to show us all these cool things and inspiring scientists for years to come.", "comment_date": "2020-07-19T23:53:36Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Rohini Vader", "comment_text": "Is that an interference pattern? <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUwVZUOSTvk&amp;t=4m55s\">4:55</a>", "comment_date": "2020-07-19T13:29:41Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "David Apodaca", "comment_text": "milf oil, you say?", "comment_date": "2020-07-18T00:14:09Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Cody Powers", "comment_text": "Is that a sine wave I see at <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUwVZUOSTvk&amp;t=4m18s\">4:18</a>?", "comment_date": "2020-07-15T03:00:39Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Jordan Robb", "comment_text": "pure nerdgasm", "comment_date": "2020-07-13T17:55:32Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Silvertarian", "comment_text": "<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUwVZUOSTvk&amp;t=7m20s\">7:20</a> how neat is that!", "comment_date": "2020-07-12T04:02:59Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Silvertarian", "comment_text": "<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUwVZUOSTvk&amp;t=4m30s\">4:30</a> I can&#39;t remember what it&#39;s called but these properties are used in communications with fiber optics.

So I checked it out one night in a friend&#39;s outdoor swimming pool.  The pool was lit up underwater, all surfaces were blue.  I gently entered the water with goggles, trying not to disturb the surface, and went to the bottom, alone in the pool.  Sure enough, TIR made the water-air interface all blue, a perfect reflection of the inside of the pool.  I felt like I was floating inside a large blue box, all alone in this weird world. The world I knew was outside, visible only through a mostly black circle on the top surface.  (It was night so the circle was mostly black.)  So cool.  Then I went up to return to the known world via that circular black door.  To my horror, the circle got smaller.  I started to panic, but the faster I went, the faster the door was closing.  (Check out the geometry.)  just as it closed, locking me inside the blue box forever, my head popped out of the water and the world returned to normal.

It&#39;s easy to think of compacting lots of photons into space. What you need, is either a black hole, or a superreflector. All modern materials have non-100% reflectance. For example, silver has 98.2% for 550 nm wavelength. So, a hypothesis: a material exists with very close to 100% reflectance (similar to superconductivity, and superfluidity), so that light bounces around almost indefinitely inside of it.&quot; Call it &quot;superreflectance&quot;. Now, I wonder, what are the materials, that are known, which are closest to superreflectors in visible light spectrum.... Or maybe we just need to slow down the light -- e.g., &quot;In 1998, Danish physicist Lene Vestergaard Hau led a combined team from Harvard University and the Rowland Institute of Science, which succeeded in slowing a beam of light to about 17 meters per second,and researchers at UC Berkeley slowed the speed of light traveling through a semiconductor to 9.7 kilometers per second in 2004. Hau later succeeded in stopping  light completely, and developed methods by which it can be stopped and  later restarted.&quot;", "comment_date": "2019-08-09T16:49:27Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "VisualAID @ OberseeBilingualSchool", "comment_text": "such a fun video", "comment_date": "2019-08-09T12:35:24Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "FrankyBoy", "comment_text": "You got to polish the sides of your acrylic to get best TIR.

That a satellite is in an orbit around the earth, regardless of whether it is a geostationary or not.

This argument is further supported by thinking of the satellite orbit based on the center mass point of the earth being a &quot;single point&quot; in space as the reference and that the satellite orbits that center mass point(point in space not in motion).<br>This argument is countered with the logic that in order for the geostationary satellite to complete a revolution, its &quot;stationary&quot; position would have to be forgone and either the satellite itself must accelerate or decelerate in relation to the referenced point(earth) in order to complete its revolution; or vice-versa(earth accelerates/decelerates its rotation).<br>2. Since we are using the earth as the reference point, that the &quot;Geostationary&quot; orbit locks the &quot;0 degree&quot; reference point with the satellite to the ground point and degree reference on earth and as such, a geostationary satellite cannot complete one revolution around earth.<br>This argument is countered changing the point of view of the observer. If an observer is external to both the earth and it&#39;s geostationary satellite, it appears that the satellite will rotate around the earth(not accounting the earth&#39;s rotation)<br><br><br>Please help, does a geostationary satellite complete a revolution around the earth? If so, how often?<br><br><br>In the case that you make a video and\u00a0If you can prove that a geostationary satellite does not\u00a0make a revolution around the Earth, please say in your video, &quot;Curtis Longoria, you owe 1st Squad Pizza&quot; at some point towards the end.", "comment_date": "2019-06-26T09:57:42Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Andrew P.", "comment_text": "Make the camera that can look all the way to the bottom", "comment_date": "2019-06-26T08:36:57Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "TOXIC REDD", "comment_text": "Nobody:<br><br>Fishes in water: i see aliens!!", "comment_date": "2019-06-26T08:21:25Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "casey ernst music", "comment_text": "Can youTell us why Johansen blocks stick together?", "comment_date": "2019-06-26T08:13:59Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "LinusKristian", "comment_text": "If you&#39;d be a teacher at a school everybody would probably love you\ud83d\ude02", "comment_date": "2019-06-26T07:39:00Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "cfuse", "comment_text": "Bearded Destin blinds fish with lasers!", "comment_date": "2019-06-26T07:07:50Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Nathan Harris", "comment_text": "So why are water optics not a thing?", "comment_date": "2019-06-26T07:05:18Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Marc Zimmer", "comment_text": "You could not see with a camera down to the ground using the internal reflection.

That fading effect on the flashlight bean is the result of the light from the flashlight coming out of the source at a wide range of different angles, some of them reach the critical angle sooner than others, and so break through sooner than others, causing a dimmer reflected beam.

A blue laser could map out a three dimensional picture of nearby objects and terrain underwater. An application might be to help prevent collision for boats in water that is shallow or has obstructions. Might also be used on slow moving submarines in some situations to avoid collisions. The range would be limited but a blue laser would maximize range within the visible spectrum.  A blue wavelength laser would travel further than a green or red laser through water before diverging too much to be practical. Blue lasers also happen to be safer for human eyes because they appear dimmer and human eyes are less sensitive to blue spectrum light, which decreases the range at which it could cause flash blindness. I don&#39;t know how sensitive marine life would be to a blue laser but the limited time and location of use may mitigate any hazard to some degree. A boat collision would likely be far more damaging to marine life so preventing collisions may be worth the trade off regardless.

Every time the reflected beam is a lot less bright than the incident one it means that a lot of light is escaping the medium; like on the acrylic tube, the only reason we can see it shine is because some the light is escaping. On actual optic fiber (the silicon one), it will look opaque since the main property is that even when bent it is capable of having total reflection.<br> Also, I don&#39;t think you noticed something supper cool that happened during the experiment with the Christmas ornament: the angle of the beam inside the ornament was not the same as the angle of incidence!

I was disappointed I couldn&#39;t see tiny beams of light bouncing off the edges like in the diagrams we drew in Modern Optics at my highschool. It might be because you only showed the beam going straight on, but it was cool nonetheless. And then the christmas thing was so brilliant (literally!) I was in awe. When you commented about internal reflection not having to be total, I was reminded of when we used a small piece of glass on a stand called--if I&#39;m not mistaken--a &quot;half mirror&quot; or a &quot;beam splitter&quot; that we used because at an angle part of the light was reflected and part was passed through. We used the difference of the two beams&#39; timing to calculate the speed of light, and that remains to this day my favourite physics demonstration I&#39;ve ever witnessed (and I&#39;ve seen A LOT). I assume the bulb lights up at that extreme angle because the light gets trapped in the thin film of the bulb as in a fiber optic cable.<br><br>But dude, thank you so much for helping me nerd out about physics.

I believe the formula was{ angle1 * index1 = angle2 * index 2 }you could use that laser and acrylic to test this formula and my memory of the formula. Just remember the formula is only for the angle from one medium to the next meaning if you were to measure the angle from just before the acrylic to just after the angle would not change since angle1*index1(air) = angle2 * index2(acrylic) = angle3* index 3(acrylic) (angle 1 must = angle 3 since index 1 and 3 are both air = roughly 1) .", "comment_date": "2019-06-21T00:23:21Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Fred The Flippin' Puffer Fish", "comment_text": "Destin: &quot;Just making some amazing breakthrough with all sorts of &#39;lab&#39; equipment&quot;<br><br><br>Also Destin: &quot;Just normal dudes with LASERS on KAYAKS&quot; <b>As he turns on a &quot;real-life&quot; Lightsaber.</b><br><br>Love this video!

The really cool thing though is that between boundaries, there&#39;s still a density gradient, so everything curves upwards as it travels.<br><br>I could go on, but I only have a bacherlor&#39;s and don&#39;t want to make it unreadable.
