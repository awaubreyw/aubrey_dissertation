Now THAT was a sensation like no other. Words can&#39;t properly convey the experience. No other launches caused that to happen........not even the space shuttle missions.

They had to build a 10 story building for air conditioning as it would cloud up and rain inside. They could assemble four Sat V rockets at the same time. If I remember right the VAB out to the pads is two miles. Saw the Crawler in use for the Saturn V. How they made the roadbed for the crawler is a video in itself. Hanger C is 6 miles south from the launch pad where the first unmanned Saturn V launched in Nov 67\u2019. The noise and vibrations broke a few windows and cracked several more. I will never forget that launch.  Don\u2019t know how it compared to the Falcon Heavy but it took much longer to clear the gantry.

The binaural audio definitely gives you the feeling that you are actually there, but so does the video. I&#39;m having trouble figuring out what  makes this video, and many other bystander videos, seem more realistic than the SpaceX footage? Even though the SpaceX footage is fantastic, it doesn&#39;t have the &quot;seeing it with your own eyes&quot; feel like this video does. At first I thought it was distance at which it was recorded. You can see more of the terrain and buildings which help put the size and speed of the rocket into perspective, but the video still looks more realistic when that&#39;s all out of frame and there is only the blue sky as the background. I keep going back and forth between the two videos, but I just can&#39;t put my finger on what makes them look so different.

People want to see a rocket entering space and docking. They also want to see the transfer through the airlock on the ISS. Speaking of airlocks, submarines have airlocks between every compartment, why are there none on the ISS? If a tiny piece of space debris puts a hole in the ISS everyone inside would instantly die from the near infinite vacuum of space. Not even spacesuits in every compartment to give them half a chance. Not sure I believe the ISS is in space.  Funny, sonic booms have never been heard during any NASA rocket launches, in fact people questioned the lack a few years back.

The rockets were actually about 15 seconds out of sync. this was because spacex wasn&#39;t sure if the radio singals would cross between the two boosters on landing. You can see this in the burns that one booster ignites slightly before the other. the second and most important piece evidence that these two videos are from the same rocket is the landing zone as seen in the landing burn. in the video at <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ImoQqNyRL8Y&amp;t=5m18s\">5:18</a> you only see lz1. lz2 is black with a white x.<br><br>I know i&#39;m being really really picky to otherwise an outstanding video but i noticed something and needed to just clarify. :P The fact that they even got these babies home is brilliant and magnificent.

In other words, the landing pad you can see is not rotationally symmetrical, so the images would not have looked identical to each other.

The first manned space flight was by Russia the 12th of April 1961.

Sure it carries more and computers allow it to land in a new way, but that&#39;s it?! No better space craft? No better means of propulsion? The first settlers sailed across the Atlantic on the Mayflower which was little more than an oversized rowboat! Columbus before that sailed August 3rd, 1492 and was at sea a solid two months before landing in the Bahamas on San Salvador. And we can barely limp to the moon with all our modern advancement. I love space and space exploration but sorry Mr. Musk, I need something more than a bigger rocket with a bigger payload to make me take notice. Feel free to shout me down and I&#39;m sure I&#39;ve rained on someone&#39;s parade but honestly, look at the whole picture and please don&#39;t tell me that thanks to our space program we now have Velcro and Tupperware and hope I pop a champagne.

Of course in the proximity of the earth there are more atoms, but still quite few compared to something that can be called an &quot;atmosphere&quot;. With all the rockets that launched and are about to launch from earth, what about the combustion products that are blasted into the almost empty vacuum of space? I could imagine due to the big difference in preasure of areas behind the rocket (filled with the atoms that are &quot;thrown&quot; out of a space crafts engine to push it forward) and the surrounding &quot;space&quot; these atoms try to evenly distribute over a large volume until gravity effects of planets and stars disturb the perfectly even distribution of matter that is desired by entropy. Still as an rough estimate with upcoming space travel to mars on a regular basis won&#39;t that &quot;fill&quot; the space between the solar systems planets with matter that is not supposed to be there in the first place? What about this material? Will it be sucked up be the gravity forces of planets and become part of them? Or will it locally increase the amount of atoms per cm\u00b3 and hence create a drag on the planets slowing them down on their orbit around sun? I know space is huge and it won&#39;t fill up just like that but with a theoretical vast increase of space travel and with the time in mind the material needs to evenly distribute into outer space I wonder if this very tiny effect can be measureable or even have real life implications on our solar system? Also in case the exhaust products are sucked up by planets, when we land on these planets in the future and analyze the material composition that we find, how do we know it is not polluted by out space travel residues?

You will also notice that one of the pads had blue paint on it and the other was white. In the video, you clearly see that &quot;both&quot; boosters were landing on the one that was white, but then it cuts out to the side view of both pads and you will see the one in the foreground was the one with the blue on it.

I too enjoyed to launch and landing of the falcon heavy. But i i disagree with your statement that the two lower camera angles shown are from each booster. i do believe the images they showed  are mirrored from booster #2. Why do i think that? well, for one, in the separation shot, both boosters show the same coastline down below. doesnt make sense, if one booster sits left, one is right, each should show a different coastline, right? Next thing, the separation, in both angles the booster tips the same direction, and shows the core in the exact same location on screen. Shouldnt it be left and right (mirrored) like a left and right booster seperated? Next thing, the boosters landing delayed, first #1, than #2. in both images, you can see booster #1 (fire and exausttrail from the engine). Booster #1 lands on a dark pad with white SpaceX marking, #2 landed on a white pad with dark spacex marking. in both captures you see it landing on the white with dark markings, landing.  I do agree a lot of engineering went into the guidance system, but both boosters landing at the exact same rotational angle? Mirrorlike landing, both boosters experienced the exact same wind conditions? not a single wiff different to another? doubtful.<br><br>Again, not saying anything negative, but i think i have some valid points to back up my claim that the videofeed shown from the boosters is in fact mirrored from #2 to #1.", "comment_date": "2018-02-08T09:11:26Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Junaid Aziz", "comment_text": "WoW!

( NOTE: I&#39;m not talking about &quot;technology&quot; and &quot;ability&quot;.......merely the raw sight &amp; sound. ) We moved to Melbourne, Florida in early 1969 when I was 7 years old. We were only a 20 minute drive from the launch pads. From that point onward, we drove to EVERY Apollo launch &amp; got as close as any civilian was legally allowed to be, and during 2 of those launches, even closer. My Dad had a friend who got us into an area even closer, due to his clearances. The sight &amp; sound.....PLUS &gt;&gt;&gt; THE FEELING of those HUGE Saturn V rockets dwarfed even the space shuttles. ( I&#39;ve watched nearly all of the shuttles LIVE &amp; in person too. ) During lift-off of those Saturn V rocket engines, the largest ever made &amp; used by NASA in their entire history.......we were standing on either a concrete slab, or asphalt, depending on which mission was being launched, and I&#39;m not kidding, standing in one spot, in addition to the incredible sight, sound, AND FEELING, you could look down at your shoes, and literally SEE YOUR FEET SLIGHTLY MOVING, DUE TO THE INTENSE VIBRATION CAUSED BY THE INCREDIBLE THRUST. No kidding, the ground was vibrating so intensely, we were actually moving around ever so slightly, but enough that we could clearly see that our feet were moving on the ground!!!  As spectacular as the space shuttle launches were, they were no match in comparing to those huge Saturn V rockets of the Apollo missions, due to having far more thrust needed to lift such a heavier payload. I still live here in Melbourne, having lived in a number of different homes throughout the years as a kid and adult. No matter where I&#39;ve lived here, simply climbing up on the roof gives you &quot;a front row seat&quot; for any launch. After watching every Saturn V rocket by the time we moved down here, it only took a couple shuttle launches later on, to realize they weren&#39;t nearly as dramatic &quot;up close&quot; ( we were spoiled by the Apollo missions )........so we simply used our roof for any other shuttle launches........and even wherever we happened to be during several launches throughout the entire area of Brevard county ( due to work or school ). No words can describe how awesome it was to witness those Saturn V rockets during launch, and I will never forget them. The shuttles were great too, just not as dramatic. And then........after seeing the very last space shuttle to be &quot;piggy backed&quot; on the top of a jumbo jet back to the Cape here, which was an awesome sight in itself to witness in person........watching all other launches since are &quot;rather boring&quot;.......for me anyway.", "comment_date": "2018-02-08T07:25:00Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Pixelwash", "comment_text": "Awesome!

You can also load it into a Google cardboard/daydream or equivalent to get the experience.<br><br>For doubters: Evidence to support this includes: The south booster lands first (and hence, is lower) but you can see it&#39;s plume in the upper frame of both feeds at the same time; the landing pads are painted differently, and have asymmetrical roads leading to them - if the footage were indeed from separate boosters, then either: The LZ would appear to be considerably different from each camera (one camera would be rotated 180deg) or the plume would not be visible in one frame (if said camera was NOT rotated 180deg). Also, if you inspect dirt and debris on the transparent shroud covering both cameras throughout the flight, you&#39;ll see that it is always exactly the same in both frames, just shifted by a few mm due to the parallax, which would be highly improbable if the cameras were on separate boosters.", "comment_date": "2018-02-07T18:49:31Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "borat smagadijev", "comment_text": "Sounds sweet on my Sennheisers 980s", "comment_date": "2018-02-07T18:48:24Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Furball Vulpes", "comment_text": "wtf why didnt you tell me about this channel earlier!?", "comment_date": "2018-02-07T18:48:03Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Mike Coolen", "comment_text": "Right before the sonic booms, somebody made a  metal noise that surprised me and I jumped and looked behind me, knowing I was all by myself in my room.

My observation was that in spite of the use of binaural recording, I didn&#39;t feel a sense of live presence.  The technology in no way compares to reality. I think there are a couple of reasons for this - technology and psychology. When we are present in a soundscape in reality, I think our brain discounts some sounds while it favours others. For example, we may pay no attention to things like camera clicks while other sounds, like perhaps a conversation nearby, will take our attention. When listening to an audio track, everything is presented to us unfiltered by our brain and suddenly insignificant sounds like camera clicks tend to dominate the recording. Beyond that, dynamic range limitations change the balance of sounds in the mix. I&#39;m sure peaks of the sound of the rocket blasting off were probably much sharper for the people there than in the recording. Finally, I&#39;m sure they could feel that sound in the pit of their stomachs and we aren&#39;t going to get that feeling from headphones.
