She was so fascinated about it and her face lit up for a second before she ran off to play with the other kids we were with.

So many these days are just sheep that follow this or that, without ever giving it a moment&#39;s serious reflection.

That&#39;s the problem with religious beliefs, they&#39;re simply not logical. People don&#39;t see the illogical nature of what they profess to believe, but fact is, many don&#39;t really know what they believe, they never to the research for themselves, they let someone else tell them what to believe.
