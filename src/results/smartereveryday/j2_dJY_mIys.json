Great video as usual. I had an idea for another video. I&#39;ve always wondered what a fire would look like if you could pause it in time and see it from all angles, using the same effect that they use in the Matrix to pause and rotate around someone during a fight scene. The idea came to me because I&#39;m curious if each flame from the fire is flat / 2D or if it has some 3D shape to it. You can&#39;t really tell in person since you can only see a flame from a 2D perspective and it changes so quickly that you can&#39;t see the other side or the top before it changes. I&#39;m hoping I explained that well enough. I figured if anyone could make a video like this you could do it.

I was making hot chocolate and to cool it off I placed an ice cube in the cup. What happened next surprised me, the liquid started to swirl as if I had just stirred it. I found this fascinating enough to where I did it again; on my third time around nothing happened. Assuming it was the heat of the water acting on the melting ice I made another cup and sure enough, it started swirling again. The ice I was using was cylindrical in shape and around 2.5cm. I did this again tonight and decided to measure the variables. At my altitude of 239M above sea level, the temperature of the water had to be no less than 79C, and the ice, if larger than 3.3cm wouldn&#39;t produce this effect. The cup was 11cm in diameter and 10cm tall. <br><br>Now that all of that is on the table, here&#39;s my question. Do you know what causes this, or would you be able to help me figure this out?

Store my commands in your heart. If you do this, you will live many years, and your life will be satisfying. Never let loyalty and kindness leave you! Tie them around your neck as a reminder. Write them deep within your heart. Then you will find favor with both God and people, and you will earn a good reputation. Trust in the Lord with all your heart; do not depend on your own understanding. Seek his will in all you do, and he will show you which path to take. Don\u2019t be impressed with your own wisdom. Instead, fear the Lord and turn away from evil. Then you will have healing for your body and strength for your bones. Honor the Lord with your wealth and with the best part of everything you produce. Then he will fill your barns with grain, and your vats will overflow with good wine. My child, don\u2019t reject the Lord\u2019s discipline, and don\u2019t be upset when he corrects you. For the Lord corrects those he loves, just as a father corrects a child in whom he delights. Joyful is the person who finds wisdom, the one who gains understanding. For wisdom is more profitable than silver, and her wages are better than gold. Wisdom is more precious than rubies; nothing you desire can compare with her. She offers you long life in her right hand, and riches and honor in her left. She will guide you down delightful paths; all her ways are satisfying. Wisdom is a tree of life to those who embrace her; happy are those who hold her tightly. By wisdom the Lord founded the earth; by understanding he created the heavens. By his knowledge the deep fountains of the earth burst forth, and the dew settles beneath the night sky. My child, don\u2019t lose sight of common sense and discernment. Hang on to them, for they will refresh your soul. They are like jewels on a necklace. They keep you safe on your way, and your feet will not stumble. You can go to bed without fear; you will lie down and sleep soundly. You need not be afraid of sudden disaster or the destruction that comes upon the wicked, for the Lord is your security. He will keep your foot from being caught in a trap. Do not withhold good from those who deserve it when it\u2019s in your power to help them. If you can help your neighbor now, don\u2019t say, \u201cCome back tomorrow, and then I\u2019ll help you.\u201d Don\u2019t plot harm against your neighbor, for those who live nearby trust you. Don\u2019t pick a fight without reason, when no one has done you harm. Don\u2019t envy violent people or copy their ways. Such wicked people are detestable to the Lord, but he offers his friendship to the godly. The Lord curses the house of the wicked, but he blesses the home of the upright. The Lord mocks the mockers but is gracious to the humble. The wise inherit honor, but fools are put to shame!\u201d<br>\u202d\u202dProverbs\u202c \u202d3 NLT", "comment_date": "2019-05-27T00:37:23Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "News that matter", "comment_text": "This channel is addicting.

I&#39;ve got a simple question, and it is giving me a headache. Does it matter which way the vortex spins? For context I&#39;m trying to put a 5 gallon bucket in line with my shop vac, to collect more of the dust before it gets to the shop vac, to hopefully prolong its life, reduce suction lose from dust buildup, and allow it to run for longer periods of time at a cooler temp. The plan, two holes in the lid of the bucket each about 1 1/4 inch, one in the middle, and one closer to the side of the bucket. The hole in the middle gets a piece of tubing inserted 4 to 6 inches into the bucket, and the other hole gets an elbow pointing into the side of the bucket. The overall direction the elbows facing determines the direction the vortex will spend. The air and dust enter the bucket, hit the wall and spin with the vortex. The dust can&#39;t immediately exit because of the pipe sticking down the middle. Then gravity forces the dust down into the dead Zone while the much lighter and faster moving air takes the path of least resistance. Some of the Dust will get by the pipe trap, and there lies the heart of my question. Should the vortex spin counterclockwise you know because of the toilets? Should the vortex spin clockwise because it&#39;s exiting vertically? If it spins clockwise wouldn&#39;t that accentuate the Coriolis effect in my favor? Is it actually the length of the pipe in the middle that will determine the efficiency of my trap? Does it matter, will either of these directions increase or decrease the amount of dust that&#39;s the trap misses? I&#39;m not joking this is what keeps me awake at night.

Take it from someone who has spent the last 7 years studying fluid flows. Yes, life is messy and jumbled up, but if everything can be set straight, you can go back, then it assumes that life has always been laminar to begin with. Laminar flows are the most restrictive flows that exist, in laminar flows you can&#39;t change the path you are on, i.e. they are represent the idea that destiny exists. Turbulent flows are random, chaotic, unpredictable, most importantly they allow for change, however, once the change is made it cannot be undone you can only go on. So yes, life is turbulent but if you apply enough energy and effort you can change the path you are on. \r<br>\r<br>If you also look at it form a bigger perspective, we don&#39;t measure flows on the impact of a single particle we measure them as a whole. It&#39;s the same for people, history does not look at the path every single person has taken, it looks at how society has changed as a whole over time. In a laminar framework, for society to arrive at its destination everyone needs to behave exactly the same, no deviations. In a turbulent flow, so long as enough energy is put into the system, it will also get there, but most importantly nobody is the same.\r<br>\r<br>Finally, if everything were to stop right now, from a laminar perspective, you can wait and then restart again without any change. Not in a turbulent system, it needs energy to survive, without energy it quickly break down. This is what life is, if you removed all the knowledge and wisdom that pushes our society forwards, life would quickly disappear but you can&#39;t just restart it by putting it all back. Turbulent flows are also characterised by the energy cascade, over time the energy of the largest structures gets distributed to the smallest structures all too keep the flow moving forwards until these small structures dissipate. This is the same for life new generations are born full of life and then they use this energy to, as a whole, move us forwards. This push becomes less and less as they age until they no longer can and die.", "comment_date": "2019-05-24T16:09:37Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Mrtweet81", "comment_text": "Reverse flow?

At least with prison, we can free them and pay them a ton of restitution money (still not enough to justify the wrongful imprisonment); with the death penalty, there&#39;s no recourse.

I was recently on a band trip with my school going to Chicago, and actually went to the mall with the laminar flow fountain. My mind was still blown and I was so excited to talk about laminar flow to my friends XD. <br><br>The effect you showed in the video is also really cool, did not expect that to be reversible.
