It would have been cool if you guys attached a camera to the end of one of the blades as you were rotating them slowly to display collective and cyclic pitch. The camera would tilt at an angle relative to the horizon, depicting the angle imparted on the blades by the swashplate adjustments. This would have been especially useful for displaying the cyclic pitch because the camera would tilt at a different angle relative to the horizon depending on the blades position around the central rotor.", "comment_date": "2014-12-06T05:53:17Z", "likes_count": 2}, {"comment_by": "moe hamadah", "comment_text": "what type of\u00a0Helicopter \u00a0is this the brand and the serial number please\u00a0", "comment_date": "2014-11-26T01:07:01Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Lau Jah", "comment_text": "I like them video because the french translation are verry good !", "comment_date": "2014-11-22T09:29:00Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "TheUselessStoner", "comment_text": "if only we had pilot who could maneuver like that.", "comment_date": "2014-10-25T07:03:07Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Din Lehliu", "comment_text": "this is sooo cool! thanks for posting. wow, have learned something today...", "comment_date": "2014-10-21T23:41:13Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Rusty Wrench Garage", "comment_text": "that first guy looked like he needed to take a dump", "comment_date": "2014-09-21T17:49:10Z", "likes_count": 17}, {"comment_by": "SuburbAllied", "comment_text": "whats the nice song you are using in the very end of the video?
