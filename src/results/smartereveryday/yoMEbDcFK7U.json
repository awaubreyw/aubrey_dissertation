(If you are a random person from youtube you don&#39;t have to read it or type negative responses cause I don&#39;t really care about random person&#39;s opinion; however, if you really have any suggestions, or, maybe you know some courses provided by universities or different organisations that could help me fulfil my dream and become a scientist (LOVE physics) I&#39;ll appreciate your response) Here&#39;s the story. I&#39;m a senior in high school and for me science is a part of my heart , that&#39;s why I love watching smartereveryday youtube channel. However, I will need to apply for university soon. I&#39;m currently taking AP and college courses at my school and give my 100% to everything. Not because I have to but because I want to. Sadly there is only one more year till college and it seems almost impossible to get to such a high level universities as MIT or CalTech and then become a scientist. In school they teach how to get a good job and make real money but they tell nothing about what to do if you want to understand the world, discover its depths and actually help people. So I really need your help as many other boys and girls do. We simply scared of the future because teachers didn&#39;t explain us in school how it feels to be a scientist. Therefore it seems so unreachable and frustrating; everyone says you have to be a ginious. I&#39;ll be really happy if you&#39;ll response.
