They both have the same idea. Not only do they teach science to the masses, not only do they show us why science important, but also they show us outcomes that are applied to our everyday life to make it more interesting and better. I got 2 examples. The first one isnt one most people would see as an interesting one. Mark rober worked for nasa before YouTube and he worked on 2 projects. One was curiosity and the other one was a satellite that scans the earth and gets results about natural events that will affect crops. The good thing about this is that nasa releases the results for free online so third world countries can be safe without having to pay in order to obtain this information. Second example is a quite interesting one. The internet started as a military tool designed to help them during any war. Just because we understand the physics of light and how to basically write information on the light wave we can have wireless connection to a world wide network of computers and servers. Also transistors exist partially because of space exploration. When nasa was designing the parts for the rocket that would send people in space the transistors that existed back then were too big so they designed new really smaller ones. So basically we owe science everything associated with technology like our smartphones and our computers.

So I chose you of course!... lol here it is...<br><br><br>A person whom I would like to spend an entire day with is Destin Sandlin, the host of the Youtube channel &quot;SmarterEveryDay&quot;. He is an American engineer but uses his scientific knowledge to teach the Youtube community. He has an educational series called Smarter Every Day, where he asks questions and then conducts experiments on them with other scientists or just by himself. He knows a lot about astronomy, astrophysics, geology, physics, and many other types of sciences. Destin is an inspiration to me because I want to be like him when I grow up. I love science, but in particular, astrophysics, I love space and I would love to apply my knowledge of science to space. Such as the laws of gravity, black holes, light, etc. I feel like he would be excited to spend a day with me as well because we both love science we could conduct experiments and find out new things. I know that if I spend a day with Destin that I could learn a lot about science and I would love every second of it. <br><br>If Destin Sandlin were a food, he would be tofu because he always thinks outside of the box and has new ideas all the time. Also, he has a simple appearance but he can transform the world with his original ideas and his wits. He is simple, down to earth, and never falling short of nothing but his best. All he does is contribute to the world and I hope that I can be like him when I grow up.", "comment_date": "2018-01-19T21:16:06Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Evan Van Heukelom", "comment_text": "Beautiful!", "comment_date": "2018-01-19T21:15:16Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Mike D", "comment_text": "Sweet!", "comment_date": "2018-01-19T21:10:39Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Hurtin Albertan", "comment_text": "My mom has done this in every house/cabin of ours.
