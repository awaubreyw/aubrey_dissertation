How you doing? I am the manager for PROJECT STINGRAY and want to help these creatures.<br><br>My company are doing the most advanced research on these stingrays and a few other animals of course. We have just recently discovered new facts for the stingray as of this year. It is so new, that there are no articles on the internet about it...yet. The employees will soon work on a website.<br><br>Our scientists have discovered the best way to make the stingray live a longer life and die from natural reasons. &quot;Natural reasons&quot; as in old age.<br><br>From their research, we have discovered that millions of years ago, all stingrays were barbless. The barb and venom came from a mutated gene tons of stingray generations ago. Then, here we are today where humans think them having a barb is &quot;normal&quot; because that is they only way we have known them.<br><br>We can increase their natural defense by going for the tail. Well, a few of our scientists did an experiment. They went to the ocean with a tank and filled it with the ocean water and brought it to the lab. Next day, some employees went fishing and caught a stingray. We cut the tail off and threw it in the tank which was the same water he came from. Visually, we didn&#39;t notice anything. So, we got the tailess ray out of the tank and it felt harder than usual.<br><br>The stingray was slippery and a guy dropped it. However, it made a strange sound when the animal hit the floor. It sounded a little too hard, so we did some experiments. To shorten it and cut to the chase...I remember a scientist talking a hammer and hitting it on top of the stingray. It did nothing to the animal and we were all shocked.<br><br>We tested the stingray and researched it for some time. We discovered that the removal of a stingray&#39;s tail and when it is submerged in the water it came from...the skin of the animal gets tough as titanium. This has been the craziest biological discovery we have ever done. Maybe, the ray doesn&#39;t even need to be submerged into the water it came from...it may just need to be touched by the ocean water it calls home and the major defense mechanisms kick in.<br><br>If you come across a stingray or know a friend that comes across a stingray...cut the tail off. If you go fishing for them or catch them by accident, make sure to bring a knife to the coast. Be careful, don&#39;t get stung and after the tail is gone pour some of the ocean water it came from on top of the tailess animal. Then, just for a quick experiment stab the top of the ray with your knife and it will not even go through the skin at all. The most it can do is make a scratch and that is it.<br><br>A tailess stingray that is swimming in the water it grew up in can&#39;t get killed by predators anymore. Sharks can only make little marks and scratches on the stingray after it&#39;s new defense system is activated...by you or any other human that wants to help. Be the best you can be and become a hero...never give up and don&#39;t back out. The stakes are high and you can make a difference for our fellow stingray animals.<br><br>Also, I am doing these experiments myself and they have been working EVERY time. I have not killed one stingray. We are here to preserve and help mother nature...in the newest of ways.<br><br>Take care and God bless,<br>Kyler R. <br><br>P.S. Sorry if this was long.

What does that mean? Are there people out there that are not human beings? Do some people deserve to accidentally die from a stingray tail?  It makes no sense any way you slice it, but just be be perfectly clear; every person on earth is a human being.  Steve Irwin did indeed die from being an idiot. Dr. Seymour had that hunch right the first time.  Irwin took an unnecessary risk, and his luck finally ran out. Just because  he cared about people and &quot;misunderstood&quot; dangerous wildlife did not mean that he wasn&#39;t an idiot that routinely put himself (and his infant child, don&#39;t forget) in mortal danger, all for entertainment and profit. To justify this, he also advocated for wildlife, though I&#39;m still not convinced his message was all that balanced. If you are an animal rights activist try not to forget that humans are animals too. <br>    I have never understood all the sycophants that come to the defense of Steve Irwin&#39;s dangerous behavior.

He adored animals, and did everything he could to protect them whilst teaching us at home who they really are, and how they should be treated. I still remember the episode when he was driving down the road, next to a field where a fire had started, and he almost started crying when he found a half-dead gecko that had be burned by the flames. He held it in his hands, with tears in his eyes, and you could literally feel his passion for these creatures.

Steve inspired a lot of people to learn more about science, one of whom was my daughter, who is starting her second year in college soon. She still hasn&#39;t settled on whether she&#39;s going the zoology or astrophysics route, but you&#39;d be surprised at how much overlap there is educationally speaking. Whichever way she goes, I&#39;ll always be grateful that she got to watch Steve at the height of his career and at just the right age when she was forming real ideas about herself as a person.", "comment_date": "2014-06-16T13:46:56Z", "likes_count": 5}, {"comment_by": "Andy Plater", "comment_text": "wow thanks for sharing", "comment_date": "2014-06-16T13:43:27Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "1800SHWEEEET", "comment_text": "ahaha, tazzy is bogan.", "comment_date": "2014-06-16T13:42:29Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Cat Ball", "comment_text": "Me and the family love watching your videos. \u00a0It&#39;s good to see quality videos out there that I know my 6 year old can watch, too, without the fear of seeing something she shouldn&#39;t. \u00a0God bless you and yours.", "comment_date": "2014-06-16T13:39:56Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Ralph oPinion", "comment_text": "I am more curious about science of cities and if recycling does cause an impact..
