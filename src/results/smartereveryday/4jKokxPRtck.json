Anyway,  I have a different take on what&#39;s happening to the Macaw&#39;s feathers on the back of their wings when they are being lifted up.  You said that&#39;s being caused by the relative low pressure area on top of the wings.  I don&#39;t think that&#39;s actually what&#39;s happening in this case.  The bird, at that point in the video, was slowing down to land.  As such, it was flying with it&#39;s wings at a relatively high angle of attack and it&#39;s wings were actually stalling around the shoulder area which is the only area where we see the feathers being lifted up.  As the wing&#39;s angle of attack (AOA) exceeds a certain limit, the airflow over the top of the wing separates and burbles off, causing a loss of lift.  There are videos of this on airplane wings where they use small strips of yarn taped to the top of the wing.  As long as the airflow is smooth, the wing is generating useable lift and the strips of yarn are all lined up and harmonious.  Once the wing stalls, the airflow separates, burbles off and the strips of yarn all go flapping around in just about every direction possible.  I think that&#39;s what happening to the feathers on the back of those birds.  You&#39;ll note that it&#39;s only happening at the shoulder area.  The birds are flapping hard as they slow down and all the lift they are making is being produced on the outer 40 to 50% of the wing which is still moving with sufficient speed because of the flapping motion and you&#39;ll note, no burbling feathers even though there&#39;s definitely lift being produced out there.  If you look at the earlier point in this video where the birds are flying level, in more of a cruise configuration, you&#39;ll note that all the feathers on the back of the birds are flat and smooth on both the down and up beats of the wings because they have good airspeed and the airflow over the top of the full span of the their wings and body is smooth and controlled, generating lift.", "comment_date": "2021-06-01T03:10:30Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Adventures with TOFFEE", "comment_text": "Toward of I get that is trying to make a kid show of how birds fly but don&#39;t do it with a real bird at nearly breaking it&#39;s bone in that wing I feel bad for the dove", "comment_date": "2021-06-01T00:46:22Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Saransh Jain", "comment_text": "hey buddy i wake up 5 am and suddenly  started thinking how bird fly   and now  i know how it works physics is awesome and i  made my own structure   how does bird fly  and it is the same but you explained  it in simple way", "comment_date": "2021-06-01T00:31:44Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Funi Man", "comment_text": "<b>casually holds a live bird for a demonstration</b>", "comment_date": "2021-05-24T01:53:24Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Meme devil", "comment_text": "I just found an hawk wth only 1 wing and a cut leg.can any tell where I could get a artificial wing for him so that he can fly again", "comment_date": "2021-05-20T21:17:55Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Anonymous Boy", "comment_text": "Funfact- Birds don&#39;t know about how they fly\ud83d\ude05", "comment_date": "2021-05-12T09:46:04Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "James Snook", "comment_text": "There&#39;s an even more interesting component to bird wings that you didn&#39;t mention.

Winds would gust up to 50 mph and the birds would &quot;fly&quot; against the wind flapping full speed and not make any ground, then tilt their wings and catch enough air to shoot them backwards.  They would repeat the process as if playing a game.  At about the same time in life, I would have my arm out the window and use my hand to plane the wind aerodynamically, and by twisting my arm just a bit, my hand would catch more air and at a certain point, catapult my hand backwards.  This was fun. <br>  I imagine if you watch the birds long enough you will see that some are more gifted &quot;athletes&quot; than others.  You&#39;ll even see different body types.  While I totally agree with SED on the information shared, I find it more surprising that SED found it as surprising as he seemed.  What I find to be of more interest is, if indeed monkeys fall out of trees, would it be possible to see a parrot crash land?

(these are great video clips ... !!!)<br>on the upstroke, when the feathers separate into a &#39;venetian blind&#39; effect, each individual feather, which is clearly air-foiled, now becomes a mini wing and is lift producing. The whole wing acts as a single lifting air-foil on the down stroke and the upstroke is still producing lift but from each feather individually- look closely and you&#39;ll see that&#39;s how the birds body continues on its level path with out oscillating up and down in response to changing lift - because the lift is constant through the whole cycle. In the slot between feathers the airflow leaving the underside of a feather accelerates over the top of the next feather, more airspeed equals more lift. In some slow flight situations that &#39;backward&#39; move you mention comes into play as well. And ...<br><br>Robert Meyer; Wolfram Hage et al at the German Aerospace Centre and University of Berlin have done wonderful research into the phenomenon of feathers popping up on the back of the wing at high angles of attack. This process stops the stalling airflow separating near the trailing edge from flowing forward to kill the lift on the forward part of the airfoil/wing, where the main lift is concentrated - and it&#39;s entirely automatic. Perfect high angle of attack stall prevention.
