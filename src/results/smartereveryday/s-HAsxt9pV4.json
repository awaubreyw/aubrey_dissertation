This is where just a steady flow of water would be sufficient... you don&#39;t have the lag of the flow, or lags in changing the temperature, etc... the Peltier junction is against your hand, and can change very quickly, depending on the current flow and direction. By changing the &quot;attack/decay/sustain/release&quot; of the current, they can make the temperature change quickly, slowly, etc, and adjust your perception.

To be able to do that. I honestly first thought about the electrical process auto makers use to heat and cool seats in vehicles. Take my dads Ram 1500, he got all the bells and whistles. This was the first vehicle I had ever ridden in that had not just heated seats, because thats been around for a long time. But also cooling function as well. I had gone to school to auto and Diesel training. I am Ford certified. But I never worked on fords. I worked on Cummins engines and freightliner trucks. My dads truck has cooling option for his seats and when you hit the button its pretty quick about removing the heat from my seat. You do feel the difference quickly. And its all done by how they direct electricity through these modules in the seats. If they run electricity one way through it the seats will heat up. If they run electricity the other way the seats will cool. I don&#39;t remember the exact names and details. But I at least remember this much. So that&#39;s why I first thought they might be using a similar system. But to my knowledge the modules are big enough to hold in one hand. But its the special material or alloy they use to do the heating and cooling thats important.

If they are using some kind of fluid or a sealed gas system with better dynamics that could also be used to flush the hot and or cold fluids quickly to individual tacts as the membranes seem thin enough for thermal transfer to happen quickly even with a gas.<br>secondly this kind of firing should provide much much faster response time........although one immediate issue i see is that when you grab a large enough object would there be enough resources to fulfill all the needs of every contact point.... given how small they are a variable pressure main line could easily compensate for the required draw........What do you think?<br>Finally, I am not an &quot;educated&quot; person so I cant exactly word it all with the right terms.

I am (or was) a fellow VR peripheral developer. Our project didn&#39;t end up coming to fruition but I wish you guys (haptx) the best of luck on your journey! What a lot of people don&#39;t realize is how hard it is to make an idea come to life. The idea/invention is the easy part. Actually making it work, R&amp;D, ordering/creating parts that don&#39;t even exist yet. Finding out that you figured out how to design a part but you have no idea how it can physically be created or who can manufacture it. Finding suppliers to make these parts at a reasonable cost while still keeping confidentiality... Then you finally figure out the mechanics of the product. Now all you need is (literally) the worlds best software engineers to engineer something that has never been done before. They have to develop your proprietary software out of thin air to communicate with your proprietary device, neither of which has ever been done by mankind. Making sure it actually works on consumer platforms. Not only that, but doing it at a latency that was unheard of a year ago. Then calculating the magnetic pull of the Earth and every possible electronic device so it doesn&#39;t dirty the magnetic tracking on the controllers. Figuring out the equation, but finding out it might be too similar to someone like Sixenses (or whoever&#39;s) patent..  Realizing you now have to license part of an idea from a company, and now you have to work with them. Not even mentioning keeping the whole team motivated, getting funding, and sticking to a budget.  There are SO many factors to developing a peripheral and you guys are nailing every single one! I am SO happy that a team is working on such an advanced device! Most people put an old cell phone vibrator in a 3d printed sleeve, call it haptics and charge 500$.  Mark my words, your company will single-handedly advance VR technology 10-15 years ahead of everyone else. I don&#39;t even care how much your product costs at first. It&#39;s just the fact that the technology will be created!  Sure the big HMD companies would love to make haptic gloves. As much as they would love to create an amazing product, some of them are public companies not focused fully in VR. So they can&#39;t release the game breaking invention right away. They can just put capacitive sensors on a controller that will show simulated finger movement. Then the next year they add another little feature. Then the next year they might add individual rumble motors to at least 2 or 3 fingers. . Then here comes your company... BAM. Everybody better step up their game! I absolutely love FB/Oculus, Valve, and every one of their team members for everything they are doing for VR and bringing it to the masses, but I am really happy that there is a team like you out there grinding and pushing the peripheral market. It&#39;s companies like yours that change the world. It is so motivating that there are teams like yours that exist.

Place your finger under the warm stream from the sink, and then pour the cold water right next to the warm water.

You see the bright side of everything, and focus on the positives, and you don&#39;t let the problems get you down.<br>4.) I love how deeply you can analyze a thing. You see features most people never notice. Often you see features even I don&#39;t notice.<br>5.) I love how you can make something we take for granted into something impressive, something worth studying. The world around me feels richer thanks to your videos.<br>6.) I love that you have a way with words. Where I often stutter and struggle to find the best word for something, and many others don&#39;t even know the big words, you have a large vocabulary and the skill to use it well.<br>7.) I love how you connect with your audience. You bridge the gap between the experts and us regular people.

For example, how does the system know an upholstered chair is softer than folding chair, or a soda can is easier to squeeze than a soup can.

I think the most important technical issue to overcome is timing.  Much like how your brain can understand hearing someone&#39;s voice AFTER seeing their lips move, but not the opposite... the lag time of the sense of touch is an important thing for your brain.  Another thing I hadn&#39;t considered is the &quot;rise time&quot; that has to do with internal stresses in your fingers.  If you conceptualize your fingers as water balloons around bones, you can understand how the internal pressure of your fingers rise the harder you press something.  This type of information coupled with the &quot;Sensory Homunculus&quot; make for some incredibly fulfilling thought experiments.  <br><br>The temperature question is something I&#39;m particularly interested in.  Using a colder fluid to model a room temperature fluid because of the heat transfer equation is a fascinating area of scientific problem solving.
