An open surface water is <b>always</b> in motion of thermal convection, driven by evaporation cooling.<br>Let&#39;s do a simple calculation: The Coriolis acceleration is a = -2 omega v. Omega is the angle velocity of the Earth&#39;s rotation 7*10^-5 s^-1. v is the radial flow velocity of the water at the surface, which is <b>extremely</b> small, say 1 cm/s.

In the 1980&#39;s, a nation wide home-supply store purchasing agent found a great deal on virus-china toilet bowl &amp; tank combinations he could purchase by the train-car load very cheaply and sell them across North America.<br>Problem...The bowl was fabricated in Brazil. The bowls spin the other way down there.  Eventually, after conducting a service call for &quot;toilet not flushing&quot;, I finally noticed the spin was the wrong direction. That toilet spin would stop in the middle of the flush cycle, and the tank would be nearly empty before the spin began to move correctly.  By then, there wasn&#39;t enough water in the tank to lift the fluid over the trap inside the preformed bowl.<br>I found the label on the back of the bowl marked &quot;Brazil&quot;, and realized what the problem was.<br>After that, for the next year, every time I got a customer-call about &quot;toilet doesn&#39;t flush&quot;, I&#39;d have the caller look for the name.  If they said &quot;Yes&quot;, I&#39;d tell them to go back to the store for a replacement and a credit invoice, and I would install it for them.  If not, I knew they needed my help for an as yet undetermined malfunction.<br>I remember the store was magnanimous in supplying the replacement bowl and paying labor for every change-out I did for the following several months.  It&#39;s truly sad they went out of business soon after, but I doubt that had a connection to the money they lost on the toilets.<br>Incidentally, I&#39;m one plumbing company out of 100 in this beach area along the Florida west coast.

Afterall, globalists MUST maintain that both the landsphere &amp; atmosphere are moving at the exact same speed. If the atmosphere were not moving, at all, then the landsphere would cause anybody, who is standing on it&#39;s surface, to experience as much wind resistance as the speed-of-spin is at his or her geological location. If standing at the Equator, then about a 1,000mph of wind resistance would be generated as the landsphere  moved you against the still air in the atmosphere. It would be like trying to stand on the wing of a futuristic jet that can travel at the speed of 1,000mph. This is why globalists MUST maintain that both the atmosphere &amp; landsphere move together at the same rate of speed. If there was even the slightest difference, between the two, then stillness of air could NEVER be experienced on a globe and the swirling Coriolis would have a cause and ever be in effect because of it. However, stillness of air is QUITE OFTEN experienced all over the world. It doesn&#39;t even matter if the Equator is moving faster than, per se, the Tropics (Cancer &amp; Capricorn) because the amount of land to speed-of-spin ratio, experienced at every line of latitude, in the whole landsphere, is equal in proportion to every other part. It has to be because it is connected, thereby, allowing no excess force to be experienced (from the overall unit thereof) when transitioning between differing speeds in differing geological locations. The same would, alikewise, be true for the overall atmosphere. Since the amount of air to speed-of-spin ratio, experienced at every line of latitude, in the whole airsphere is equal in proportion to every other part. It has to be because it is connected, thereby, allowing no excess force to be experienced (from the overall unit thereof) when transitioning between differing speeds in differing aerospace locations. And since so called: &quot;outerspace&quot; consists of no substance, at all, then the atmosphere would receive no frictional resistance on it&#39;s convexed outer rim from that.  Nonetheless, it&#39;s concave underside, being a thick gaseous air fluid, would interlock with the landsphere&#39;s round ridgity surface (like a bike chain on a sprocket) and, therefore, would allow no kind of swirling motion (or Coriolis Effect) to be experienced (from the overall conjoined unit thereof) when transitioning between differing speeds in differing      landsphere-to-atmosphere connected locations. This is because they are married &amp; interlocked as a conjoined unit themselves. Though one is harder than the other, they are conjoined &amp; propelled together at the exact same speed. Such would allow for isolated disturbances (due to other factors) but never as a direct cause of their overall union. This leaves the swirling Coriolis Effect with no CAUSE! So in order for you to continue maintaining the false notion, you will have to dream of a slightly offset atmosphere-to-landsphere connection by which absolute stillness of air is never experienced on the face of the whole globe (even though, in reality, stillness of air is often experienced all over the world in many different locations). Nonetheless, you absolutely can NOT have it both ways, Sir!!!

Then there&#39;s making a connection to the toilet bowls.  In the formula for Coriolis sits velocity.  If the velocity is zero, there is no Coriolis.  The water in both the toilet bowl and your pools started at near enough to zero, but both get velocity as they move in toward the drain.  Problem with the toilet is that there is too little time and distance to build that up to any significant degree.  You rightly pointed out that it is more jet and bowl shape dependent.  Your pool had time and enough distance to let that very small Coriolis that had built up with motion, to finally overcome (probably, we don&#39;t know until you run 29 more) the other forces possible.  Was it deionized water with no magnetic fields?  I know that would be small at best but an ionic gradient in a field could come near the Coriolis force involved here.", "comment_date": "2016-12-12T15:09:57Z", "likes_count": 5}, {"comment_by": "MARK mark two", "comment_text": "But what if you place the center of the pool right on the equator? it would have same distances from the center of earth&#39;s rotation so how would that work?", "comment_date": "2016-12-12T06:14:49Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Frederikja", "comment_text": "what if you do it on equator? realy nice vid tho", "comment_date": "2016-12-11T10:03:14Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Elk", "comment_text": "HAHAHAHA!!!

You&#39;d know that if you cared to read Newton&#39;s book of Principia. He himself uses the word &quot;if&quot; a thousand times in that book because he himself was not certain, know why? Because it was a THEORY, not a FACT.<br>What is currently deemed &quot;Science&quot; like Einstein&#39;s theory of relativity and Newton&#39;s supposed &quot;law of gravity&quot;, are what&#39;s truly dubious. Heliocentrists cannot show us a single object massive enough that by virtue of its mass alone causes other smaller masses to stick to or orbit it as they claim happens with the Sun, Moon, Earth, Stars and Planets. If you cannot give me a single practical example of &quot;gravity&quot; smaller than the Earth or the Sun, then it is merely heresay, not science! Other than magnets, there are no objects they can point to to prove their supposed &quot;gravity&quot; that&#39;s strong enough to hold people, buildings and the oceans stuck to the underside of a spinning ball-Earth, but weak enough to allow little bugs, birds, and helium balloons to fly away with ease. If there was a magical magnetism that held our feet firm to the underside of a spinning ball, we would feel this magical force every time we lifted our leg, and the force would increase like a magnet the closer our foot was to the ground.<br>The idea that people are standing, ships are sailing and planes are flying upside down on certain parts of Earth while others tilted at 90 degrees and all other impossible angles is complete absurdity. The idea that a man digging a hole straight down could eventually reach sky on the other side is ludicrous. Common sense tells every free-thinking person correctly that there truly is an &quot;up&quot; and \u201cdown\u201d in nature, unlike the &quot;everything is relative&quot; rhetoric of the Newtonian/Einsteinian paradigm.<br>You jump off a building or cliff and fall down because that&#39;s how nature is. Everything that goes up must come down. Gravity is simply density and buoyancy. People argue that things with different densities fall at the same rate through air. However, that is because both items have reached critical density in relation to its medium: air. If you were to change the medium from air to say, water or liquid mercury, the critical density to achieve the same rate of falling would increase significantly. Critical density is directly proportional to the medium density. Thus the denser the medium... The denser the objects would have to be in order to achieve the same rate of falling. A basketball and a rock might fall at the same speed in air. However... Drop them in a thicker medium like water... And they will not fall at the same rate. That is because critical density has not been achieved by both the rock and the basketball, in water as its medium. In a vacuum... Critical density is zero and is the reason why objects of any density fall at exactly the same rate. Any medium denser than a vacuum has a greater critical density than zero... Thus the reason why objects that haven&#39;t attained critical density fall slower in certain mediums. Critical density variation is &quot;gravity&quot;.<br>So, an object is dropped from a high altitude, this would not and does not, slow down as it gets closer to Earth. The object is free-falling and accelerating as it falls due to the laws of density, not because some magical force is &quot;pulling&quot; it down. There is more oxygen closer to Earth than say twenty miles up, so how does one propose &quot;gravity&quot; explains this and density does not? Oxygen is a denser gas than nitrogen and the other majority elements in our atmosphere. Where is the &quot;pulling force&quot; pulling the oxygen down? The rate at which objects rise or fall depends on the resistance (or lack thereof) in the medium surrounding.<br>Examples:<br>The submarine can use compressed air to ascend in water.<br>The hot-air-balloon can use hot air to ascend in the atmosphere.<br>The airplane can use pressure difference across its flying surfaces to gain lift.<br>There is no pulling. Only falling and rising. No force pulls down.<br>The theory of gravity was debunked and disproven/refuted by General Relativity. The theory of general relativity was debunked and disproven/refuted by Flat Earth.<br>What people think as Gravity could be seen as the electromagnetic attractive force that a dense mass of charged particles emits out on other electromagnetically charged masses of particle dense objects. Gravity is electromagnetism on a Flat Earth. Density will increase electromagnetism. So will heat.. pressure.. and friction.. Static interaction.. Sound...<br>Did you know when gravity was made up, electricity hadn&#39;t even been invented?<br>The globe earth does not exist, relativity does not exist, gravity does not exist, aliens do not exist, the Easter bunny does not exist, the tooth fairy does not exist and Santa Claus does not exist, neither do dragons.

Mathematically, your pool is not large enough in diameter to exhibit any noticeable effect from the coriolis effect. Second, if your drain is even SLIGHTLY off kilter or off centre, that will influence the spin of the water far more than the rotation of the earth. Any imperfections in the surface of the drain would affect it as well. It&#39;s an interesting demonstration, but I think the random imperfections in the sides of the pool and the surfaces of the drain would influence the direction the water goes more than the rotation of the earth.<br><br>Suggestion: Set up five pools in identical manners, cover them with fine mesh to prevent air currents or foreign material from affecting the pool, then drain them all simultaneously. additionally, a neutrally buoyant particulate in the water might be a better way of demonstrating the currents, as dripping dye into the water will introduce currents as well. (I noticed in the video, that you introduced the dye in the same direction as you wanted the water to spin).", "comment_date": "2015-06-07T23:46:08Z", "likes_count": 2}, {"comment_by": "Get Free iTunes, Xbox, Amazon, PSN, Starbucks Gift Card Codes", "comment_text": "it is commonly unknown that a special pIace on the web exists where you can go and get f.r.e.e gift c.a.r.d.s? any gift c.a.r.d you want.

A meter is 1/10,000,00 of the distance between the North Pole and the equator. The kiddie pool is 2 meters across. So the difference in speed between the &quot;North&quot; end of the drain and the &quot;South&quot; end of the drain is 2/10,000,000 of about 1,000KPH (due to your latitude). That equals a speed difference between the north point and the south point as twenty centimeters (about 7 inches) PER HOUR. As my analog watch dial is 3cm in diameter, the speed which the hour hand moves around the dial is 10 cm per hour, a rough approximation of the speed of the one of the furthest points from the drain on the pool. The viscosity of water, Brownian motion,  and how the drain was made (is it made by the manufacturer to spin?) would completely overwhelm any Coriolis effect that is this small.  Even tornadoes are too small to have them spin in any particular direction. Hurricanes are much, much, much larger so the Coriolis effect does indeed make it spin counterclockwise in the Northern Hemisphere. The math first before the experiments begin can show how much trust you can put into the results you see.<br>EDIT: the Wiki article about the Coriolis Effect had an example of a scientific experiment in 1908 that showed a statistically significant result of CCL draining of a 1.8 meter tub of water with initial conditions similar to what was done in this experiment but under  &quot;carefully controlled laboratory conditions&quot;, it took  over 15 minutes before any rotation occurred,  it was done many times, and the results averaged (which to me means that sometimes it did NOT go CCL).

It never fails!<br><br>About the idea of performing this experiment at the equator, this Coriolis effect can be used to locate, over several months of repositioning four separate pools, the exact position of the Earth&#39;s equator. However, because space is a continuum, it&#39;s practically impossible for a human to place something perfectly on the equator. Therefore, there will always be one side of the pool that has more force being applied and therefore there will always be a predetermined direction.

For perturbations with spatial scales smaller than this, the Coriolis terms in the momentum equation can be safely scaled out. However, if you include the affect of relative vorticity, the deformation radius rapidly shrinks as relative vorticity is increased (an argument sometimes used to explain the genesis of tropical cyclones at low latitudes).\u00a0 If we consider the possibility that the valve itself induced a relative vorticity in the flow as the water flowed into the valve, through it, and out of the pool, the flow can quickly come into balance between a developing radial pressure gradient force and a reactive centrifugal force above the valve.\u00a0 This type of balance (cyclostrophic) is much more likely to be achieved on the spatial scales of this experiment. I am therefore wondering whether the observed circulation is actually more appropriately classified as cyclostrophic and not geostrophic.\u00a0 Did you by any chance repeat the experiment a few times to see if the flow continually favored the same direction of rotation?
