I like it because it&#39;s humorous but I really did have 7 rules... most were personal but a few stand out...<br><br>1) Don&#39;t rush in...  I wish I hadn&#39;t done mine straight out of grad school - 5 years on, I would have done so much better with some experience behind me, and the mindset of someone who has returned to study.  I think you got this covered...<br><br>2) pick a subject you are absolutely passionate about. Don&#39;t compromise on this. it&#39;s likely you will face times when you stop caring - picking something you love minimises this risk.<br><br>3) choose a supervisor carefully - during my 4th year I had 2 - both knew nothing about the others subject matter, so I had to translate - consequently I knew both areas rather well...  It is a good approach to take... (I had 3 supervisors - none of whom knew my subject well)<br><br>4) most important of all - it&#39;s very easy to give up your social life to squeeze in time for the study. It&#39;s necessary, in fact. But. Don&#39;t give it all up. Interacting with other people - socially, professionally, is so vitally important. I can&#39;t emphasis this one enough... other people are the core of your success in a PhD... or.. anything really...  I made this mistake big time... took me years to recover...
