However, the pressure sensors developed today could theoretically be inserted into a body sock outfit to simulate wind one would experience while sky-diving. Maybe to experience the G-force of a pilot flying the f-22 Raptor. Actually, and now that I think about it, One could be strapped into a Gyro-Sphere capable of spinning into inverting positions and fly with the Blue Angels. Whoever designs such tech could build flight simulators and sell to the military. I&#39;m aware they already have other examples, but simulators of that magnitude? It only requires a prototype in progress to gain funding from DARPA. And, if qualified, you could get the specks of classified weapons systems, flight characteristics, and advancing radar systems for each aircraft for training purposes.

Also, by having a  glove that has a wire attached to it so when you touch something in the virtual world the wire attached to your glove will pull back your hand just as your touching the wall or an in game npc/character by blocking your hand from moving, so it can create that effect of you touching something. And adding a full body suit so that when something touches you in the game, for example, if someone is hand shaking you, you won&#39;t feel how you will usually feel handshaking someone in real life, but the suit will make you feel a little tingling sensation so you can get that effect,  and if its a hard hit by some player or monster in the game, the suit will make you feel like your getting lightly punched. This is my idea of full dive and i think this is how it can be made to feel like and look like your actually in the world without to much complicated stuff going on!", "comment_date": "2019-01-31T04:20:58Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "ObsidianFlight", "comment_text": "get rekt i watched the movie hah", "comment_date": "2019-01-31T00:41:32Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Max Goof", "comment_text": "You would be the guy to mention the book rather than the movie.", "comment_date": "2019-01-30T20:12:09Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "The Alchemist King", "comment_text": "heh, i said the tech wasent to far away after watching it.

Then maybe something on the pads of your fingers to tell when you have grabbed the object. I say maybe about that last part because you couldnt exactly do that if you are trying to free form an object that you dont actually have. Depending on how flexibly you can utilise those tendenons you might could even make &quot;squishy&quot; objects.

Of course, I&#39;m no engineer (not yet anyway XD), but I&#39;ve wondered about how this would be done if I had the technological know-how to implement it. The main flaw in SAO is that they get &quot;fake&quot; feedback through neural feedback, and because of that their muscles atrophy if that persists for too long. <br><br>I imagined a sort of pod-like device, kinda like those gimbal rigs that astronauts use to train for 3D rotational motion, except within it was an exoskeleton that you can wear. The exoskeleton would do exactly like what the haptic glove did: resist range of motion based on interactions with the virtual environment. It would generate force against your body when you interacted with objects in the VR, and that&#39;d ensure that any exercise and any skill you did in the virtual world corresponded to your body actually doing it and learning the skills in the real world. Basically like the controls they use in Pacific Rim. So, if you got strong enough to be able to lift a 300lb boulder above your head in the virtual world, you&#39;d be strong enough to be able to do it in real life too. <br><br>If those bands they used to resist the finger movements were able to be extended to all the other limbs in the body, they&#39;ve basically brought my little fantasy VR device to life. If not, they&#39;ve definitely made a giant leap towards it.

They use a metal board that can project the vertices of the 3D model to your hand then spin it around, so you can feel the shape of the model, and use different type of vibration to project different texture. You can even pick up object in the 3D space and place it on your palm.The main problem I notice is when I place the 3D object on my palm(facing upward), the device had problem projecting it to my hand since they can only project upward with that setup. I guess that is why the main application of their product is in vehicle which allow you to hover your hand and able to turn audio up/down with a virtue button that you can feel. Another application is at hospital elevator which you can select the floor without touching the dirty panels.", "comment_date": "2018-03-01T22:29:43Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "GTA5Player1", "comment_text": "Couldn&#39;t Leap Motion do this already?", "comment_date": "2018-03-01T22:28:47Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Michael Scottland", "comment_text": "What else can be fingered ?", "comment_date": "2018-03-01T22:28:31Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Crash johnny", "comment_text": "Amazing!!", "comment_date": "2018-03-01T22:26:18Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "TotalyFree2BMe", "comment_text": "imagine vr chat with this glove", "comment_date": "2018-03-01T22:26:03Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "tender lovell care", "comment_text": "One step closer to the matrix! \ud83d\ude0b", "comment_date": "2018-03-01T22:25:37Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Blanca Martinez", "comment_text": "woah!

It&#39;s certainly a highly ridiculous game, but the basic premise of it is honestly magical. Being able to almost be in the same room as someone on the other side of the world, talk with them in real time, and even read their body language.. That is an amazing thing. I&#39;m someone with an uncle who lives in Mississippi, and I live in Michigan. My uncle happens to be an awesome person, so I like spending time with him, but we&#39;re a few states away. VR could help make that distance gap more bearable. <br>And <i>that</i> is just an <i>example</i> of the wonders that VR is capable of bringing.<br>Of course, I don&#39;t mean any of this to downplay your own opinion, but I <i>am</i> a quite a bit surprised that you disagree with it so [seemingly] intensely.<br>Either way, it&#39;s cool that you spoke so highly of this haptic feedback glove.
