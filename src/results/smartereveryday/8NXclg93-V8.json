At least if it is CGI it is a masterful job.  The feather detail is great, especially if you consider the tuft of feathers sticking out around 1:06.  The bird is more focused and clearer because it is a different distance to the camera than the others.  If they are using a flip camera, you get a better picture closer up than further back so that would make sense.\n\nI liked the video, entertaining and informative.
