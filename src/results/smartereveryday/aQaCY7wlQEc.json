Brazil is the leading producer of niobium (after it was smuggled to that country by A smuggler called KLAW). Niobium is used mostly in alloys, the largest part in special steel such as that used in gas pipelines and captain America&#39;s shield.. Although these alloys contain a maximum of 0.1%, the small percentage of niobium enhances the strength of the steel. The temperature stability of niobium-containing superalloys is important for its use in jet and rocket engines and Iron man&#39;s armor suit....    :-)", "comment_date": "2018-08-31T23:17:25Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Fester", "comment_text": "Was there a TPS report?

The spacecraft would not be able to use its electronic equipment like gyros and other guidance systems to make it to the Sun and back. I do not believe that the radiocommunications will be possible, maybe they are hoping to send this probe to collect data and then retrieve it once the probe returns. I imagine huge corona fields around the probe due to ionization, and that would block any radio signals to and from Earth. Another thing is the gravity force near the Sun; is this little  spec of metal dust able to avoid being sucked by the Sun gravity? If the mission is to get only close to the Sun to measure some plasma and other fields, that could be done without going past Mercury orbit, collect some data and use computer models. But if the mission is to actually touch the Sun, I cannot imagine a successful mission..Then the high density of neutrinos or particles unknown to man would penetrate the known to man metals this spacecraft is made of, and alter the computer chips and the electrons that flow inside the spacecraft systems...&quot;systedjh boot enbrror&quot;, &quot;please rllobd firmwbbreell&quot;<br>There is another design that had to be considered, maybe get inspired by the aliens ;-)", "comment_date": "2018-08-26T06:13:16Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "quertbarbie62", "comment_text": "Question about the light collector at the back, given that shadows tend to be bigger the closer you bring your shadow caster to the source of light, Wouldnt the sun be too big that the collector will still detect light from the sun as the shield can only light coming directly in front of it?", "comment_date": "2018-08-26T06:13:15Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "LukeHStudios", "comment_text": "My thoughts on this video...
