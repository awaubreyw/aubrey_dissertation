Maybe the built-in ASIC, a semiconductor chip that reads/amplifies/conditions/digitizes the signal from the mems crystal, is not optically shielded/isolated, and when you shine a laser in the microphone&#39;s opening, such concentrated light somehow bounces inside the shell and illuminates the analog preamp circuits of the ASIC? If you shine a strong light over an open ASIC die, some its components start behaving like photodiodes, and if this ASIC contains some analog circuitry, the task is even more simple.

With such small devices, that makes sense that it would work, because of the scale of the membrane approaching the order of magnitude of the wavelength of the carrier. Photoelectric my blub. It&#39;s just normal demodulation by passive circuit (just the membrane) because of high energy (laser, hmm?) and because of the wavelength being in the same ballpark as the size of that membrane. A much better known example of this, are singing toasters and singing garage doors (yes, the actual door panes, not the electronic openers, just old fashioned unpowered garage door panes) in the vicinity of long range AM antennas. A much observed creepy issue in the 70s and 80s because of the massive increase in metal in our homes, effectively increasing the chances that one circuit will react as a tuned circuit. The effect requires metal to work, because any metal frame or structure, given the right ratio with the signal, will act like an LC circuit (inductive and capacitive effects) or an RC circuit (resistive and capacitive effects) which demodulate AM, because that&#39;s what AM does. IT IS a big thing to bring under the attention of people, showing the vulnerabilities and the absolute necessity to keep a human decision in between at all times.

You can&#39;t see the cameras from the google app only from the nest app. And the google assistance in general is seriously lacking (In so many ways). You ant set your google assistant own trigger name. The only thing that does work great is the capability to tell google to clean a given room with iRobot (and even iRobot has software bugs - I had to factory reset it) Seriously, when you have 26 products in your home like I do that are supposed to be smart - you have to babysit them all the time! and this is frustrating especially when it cost so much.

On a side note also I have a camera .. Now if I used the voice code from yelling at my window outside, which i did one day. I had to keep running to the door cause I could not hear the alexa response or the door chime from outside unless I am right at the door.   (so with my voice outside my house I can open my door if I yell loud enough) but I get 3 attempts and have to walk to try the door 3 times (i know it is 3 times) but maybe a hacker will walk up more then that getting a nice alert on my door camera multiple times .. smile !", "comment_date": "2020-10-29T17:11:11Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "UNITED STATES", "comment_text": "THE OLD WAY IS THE BEST WAY", "comment_date": "2020-10-29T12:16:45Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "imetlannette", "comment_text": "breaking into a smart house with my voice 1,000,000 dollar idea", "comment_date": "2020-10-29T03:27:26Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Patrick Wilson", "comment_text": "So Google said she cant verify your voice, she said you can give it another go if you like", "comment_date": "2020-10-29T02:45:00Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Jaime Llad\u00f3", "comment_text": "Why you didn&#39;t use an speaker with apple home assistant ?", "comment_date": "2020-10-28T13:10:41Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Paco Herfter", "comment_text": "modern solutions require modern problems", "comment_date": "2020-10-27T18:49:02Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "agung oka", "comment_text": "hey destin, i have a quite interesting question.

So, as long as the software has that 5 second delay between each allowed attempt, that vulnerability isn&#39;t a real problem in the real world. Where it would be a problem is if the door lock itself had a microphone of this type and can just be told to &#39;unlock&#39; from the inside as a safety &#39;feature&#39;. Presumably, especially by using lower bandwidths like infrared, the pulsating light can actually vibrate the air, though it won&#39;t produce the same soundwave a human or a speaker would produce, as far as the microphone is concerned, it&#39;s sensing the same thing. So the weakness in that system is the over- simplified microphone technology. Interesting concepts. Of course, if the house has an answerphone and you&#39;ve recorded and mashed together clips of the house owner speaking, you don&#39;t need a Lazer or any of that technology.

Chemical solutions, solids, etc.  The phenomenon is called Photo-acoustic spectroscopy.  Essentially shine a laser (tunable chemical dye laser) on a substance and record the acoustic signal with a piezo electric crystal/microphone or pressure transducer.  Mems was just getting started at the time and Silicon wafer techniques were passe&#39; because MosFet technology was taking off. <br><br><br><br>The phenomena is wavelength dependent, hence  the tuneable part of the science.  this was also the impetus for the laser microphone  for eavesdropping.<br><br><br>---naturally, at the time this technology was very new.  we had to make our own lasers since Darpa wanted part of that too.  The PhD program required quarterly &#39;Qualifying&quot; exams and the first question about this technology was proposed.    So one smart-azz came up with the answer for What is Photo-Acoustic Spectroscopy?  Ans.  Using very loud speakers  (hypercones), bombard a sample with extreme levels acoustic energy and measure the light given off with a spectrophotmeter.   Not exactly the right answer, but it did have the Conservation of Energy law in its corner.<br><br><br>Thanks for the video,  keep up the science.

This would be less conspicuous than setting up an elaborate rig outside the premises and running a lengthy brute-force attack. Also, not many people would want to control someone else&#39;s air conditioning settings; though anyone with a reasonable amount of knowledge (or an internet connection to establish such knowledge) could just crack open the cover and bypass the temperature control to make it run 100% hot or cold. At the same time, it&#39;s a very impressive discovery and certainly something that would only be illuminated (have your own take regarding puns) by thinking &#39;outside the box&#39;. It&#39;s certainly possible that the microphones are reacting to thermal deformation. The only thing that makes me think otherwise is the response time; for which thermal deformation is certainly not high frequency compared to typical digital signals or transducers that create such signals. The sensing circuitry is either amplified quite significantly to pick up minor deformations that translate into a fluctuating analog signal (before amplifier, filter and ADC), or the encoding of such a signal is quite forgiving (timing-wise). I can see how photons may also be responsible; but using my brain to analyze it intuitively suggests an impending headache. If infrared works, then perhaps it is indeed a thermal response; &#39;perhaps&#39; being a sticky-word. Big cheers for coming up with even the idea of using this method in the first place.

Concentrated light can be used to push solar sails as a form of propulsion, which I think is the same when transmitting audio. Then membrane seems to be sensitive enough to modulate with different variations in light. The Israelis invented a membrane with no circuitry (a bug) in which an unnamed intelligence service sneaked into an embassy. With out a piezoelectric circuit, it was undetectable by conventional means, however when firing a laser from across the street they could listen to the modulation of the membrane caused by talking in the room and translate that on a laptop back into audio. Inversely, sending audio works the same way as receiving. My guess is maybe this only works when its quiet, and not at all when firing through a window while there is sound in the room as the windows would be modulated also which would interfere with the original modulation of the membrane without software to compensate for the distortion.

Maybe a super-sensitive directional microphone, (or even with an infrared laser, or perhaps a similar red or blue laser in the\u00a0visible spectrum) could a microphone be rigged to capture (record) the voice pin codes that have been set up in such controllers? \u00a0I&#39;m thinking that pane of glass would act as a nice vibrating (reflective?) surface for the spoken commands, that could then be picked up by the microphone. \u00a0 Now with that bit of stealth info, the same sort of laser set up might be used to send the approved PIN codes to the controller, as you have demonstrated. \u00a0Now, it would not really be a matter of fooling the built in microphones, but of\u00a0stealthily stealing the necessary information, recording it, and transmitting it at a later time from a distance (if necessary) or simply inputting/activating the codes in person.<br><br>It would seem, that like a lot of things, security is far\u00a0more vaporous than any of us thought, and as reliant as we&#39;ve become on such basically cheap components, we&#39;ve laid our very homes an lives open to being\u00a0sacrificed on that altar of false consumer security. \u00a0- Peace", "comment_date": "2019-12-29T12:12:07Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Justice Evans", "comment_text": "Technically this could be very bad if you could incorporate a laser with an algorithm (robot).

It&#39;s gonna be kinda long, but it&#39;s my opinion about the subject.<br> Once I&#39;ve tried to play with IR Leds connected to Earphone AUX making IR Remotes. You just play *.wav file sending the code, and controlling your TV, AC.. etc... You can find the product on e-bay for really cheap right now. <br> Now what was interesting, it&#39;s when I&#39;ve tried to connect IR led to microphone. I&#39;ve noticed that Mic have always some voltage running through connection. So what is actually happening is... it&#39;s too hard to measure vibration of the microphone when it&#39;s not loaded. It&#39;s much easier to measure the difference in active volts line. *Sorry English is not my primer language. So it made me curious what&#39;s gonna happen if I connect IR Led to a Mic. I did that, and saw some weak light through a camera. Ok... I took a remote control pointed it to IR led connected to the Mic and recorded the signal on my dictaphone from Remote control. And actually succeeded to Record some spikes.<br> So why am I explaining that? Shootin the laser you playing with resistance in Microphone circuit, and ofcourse if you adjust the right wave and speed you will trigger the algorithm silently. But it&#39;s actually really easy to prevent by making some wall in front of the Mic or putting some filter. Like when you had a problem to shoot on smartphone. Also it&#39;s gonna be hard to broot force it with a laser, because you need a real time tries, you can not shoot them like 100 in one second. And you can easily program it to shut all the tries after couple of wrong attempts.<br> P.S.

So if light energy can create separation of charges over the membrane quite quick, then I believe that those light signals could be pulsated to make an energy differential at the membrane, which in turn will provide a false, non mechanical driven signal to the nodes.

If my education serves me correctly a laser can send data very similar to an AM (Amplitude Modulation) radio transmitter. Notice the Amplitude or brightness in other words of the laser changing. It is a technique people have used to tramsmitt even music accross a laser beam (even an led!) That is then picked up by an LDR (Light Dependent Resistor) or a solar panel. The laser has a constant &quot;amplitude&quot; that increases or decreases proportional to the audio signal being sent. It&#39;s a type PAM (Pulse Amplitude Modulation) or a type of Light Pulse Modulation. The changing intensity is superimposed upon the constant beam intensity. While the beam is not changing there is no movement of the diaphragm so no fluctuation of the voltage accross it due to it acting as a capacitor (very similar to a standard condenser mic). The moment there is an increment of intensety or decrement of intensety the diaphragm will react accordingly as if it was a standard air pressure wave.

This was likely simply in measures to stop attack from people trying to mimick your voice, but this translate well to this sort of attack. <br><br>I speak only of them because I own their products and understand their security (it\u2019s important you should do the same for the products you own to understand any vulnerability and how you can negate it). Hopefully some of you in the comments find this interesting. <br><br>The first precaution is of course trying to make sure only someone who sounds like you can activate the assistant (hence your intro did not create a reminder on my phone). This means that for someone to make commands to an iPhone, you have to either have a recording of them or know them and also be able to imitate their voice (hard even if you know them but they aren\u2019t around and you didn\u2019t just hear them speak, hence you likely need a recording as before, or are a good friend and unlikely to want to do harm). <br><br>Anyway Apple tailors the level of security for Siri based on context. The Apple Watch has the lowest level of speech recognition. Almost anyone can activate it. But it\u2019s on your wrist all the time, and when you take it off it locks so Siri doesn\u2019t work at all. So if it\u2019s on your table at night charging the laser won\u2019t work. And whilst it\u2019s on your wrist it also won\u2019t work - because well if someone tries to trick it whilst it\u2019s on you can just cancel it but you\u2019re awake to fix and issues anyway if your friend is being a pain with the lights etc. And laser won\u2019t track a tiny mic on a moving wrist. You can also just cancel by pressing the crown. <br><br>Then next level up is iPhone. iPhone can have Siri when locked, so could be fooled by this when say it\u2019s charging and you\u2019re asleep. Because of this Apple increased the specificity of voice required. This is also made possible due to the larger footprint and battery of an iPhone, enabling higher quality microphones. So regardless even if you manage to trick Siri with a sort of close to voice match, you can literally do nothing. Apple needs the device unlocked. And to anyone who hasn\u2019t used Face ID and thinks this is a pain, you\u2019re wrong. By the time you say hey Siri into the phone it\u2019s probably unlocked so your command happens (90% of the time) seamlessly. Definitely with it for the security benefit. So that\u2019s watch and iPhone - id say 99% safe. and again of course you always get an audio and visual signal that Siri has been activated, so you can quickly cancel any rogue commands by hitting the right side button. <br><br>Now HomePod. Again it\u2019s lack of voice assistant features helps it\u2019s security. HomePod is fairly dumb as a smart speaker (music sounds great though have to say) but that means that you can\u2019t do anything super private without explicitly turning it on without verification from your iPhone. So whilst it accepts anyone to turn on your lights, it\u2019s not going to message your boss etc. And this leads on nicely to the recent update which added all of these features. Except again Apple was clever. HomePod sits vulnerable in the open. Not to mention the fact that you cant actually determine the position of the microphones from the outside, and I would assume the mesh fabric covering decreases the attack range. But say by some miracle you had the laser trained on the microphone. Well HomePod has the best microphones and therefore the strictest voice recognition. You would NEED a recording to play through the laser. My brother can activate Siri on my iPhone, but he can\u2019t act as me on HomePod. It is extremely specific and vigilant. If you want to send texts or personal stuff from my phone with HomePod, you have to be me or have a recording of me. Doesn\u2019t work like on the iPhone. Hence unless you know the person and managed to record them (in which case you are likely a friend with no bad intent) specifically saying the command and hey Siri, you\u2019re out of luck. So like 1 in a million straight out of the gate! <br><br>So basically an attack on all of the main 3 is very difficult. I don\u2019t know about Mac, I don\u2019t yet have experience with a newer generation with hey Siri. <br><br>I also wonder if the waterproofing membranes on the Apple Watch and water resistant membranes on the iPhone help to block laser attacks also. That would also align with the idea that Apple Watch has the poorest microphone hence is least voice specific due to all the goop stopping water getting in, and why HomePod with none can afford to be more specific. <br><br>I\u2019d also like to know if the HomePod mesh fabric reduces attack range, if it is possible to locate a microphone without removing the mesh jacket (of course study pictures beforehand) and whether HomePod accepts inputs where it hears sound only from one microphone, or whether Apple knew a targeted attack like this was possible and made HomePod analyse whether any of the other mics picked up a similar sound, as they would with a real person speaking. <br><br>As someone who takes privacy fairly seriously, and with Apple supposedly having your back I hope this comment stands up. And also we can find vulnerabilities, so they can be fixed or we know how to negate them. <br><br>Excellent video, id really appreciate if anyone can dispute or correct anything I\u2019ve said, or simply add to it.

I believe that a properly designed smart home should not use voice recognition to open doors.  Instead it should be via smart phone that uses biometrics such as your face or fingerprint to unlock.  Basically it would require you to use a specific phone that connects to that homes WiFi connection to determine if the phone is a authenticated device, then it will rely on the phones biometric security to authenticate the user.

It is also similar to techniques that hackers are still developing. <br><br>.<br><br>You mentioned &quot;laser mikes&quot;, aimed at windows.  A couple of years ago someone demonstrated aiming the laser at crumpled foil, like a chip bag, and being able to recover voice from the vibration.  So if you are inside the room, but across it with no window to bounce off, you could aim at their discarded chip back to eavesdrop...<br><br>.<br>Or using voice recognition to translate the sound of typing on a keyboard into the actual key presses (letters)! <br><br>.<br>These MANY various spy techniques are really amazing. And scary. <br><br>.<br>A couple of days ago I was reading an article about using laser light to induce vibration in a human body to create ultrasonic images. The idea is use it in situations where touch is not possible, such as burn victims. <br><br>.<br><br>Bottom line, for the (justifiably) paranoid, it is a good idea to still not allow these spy devices into your home unless you invest time learning about hacking techniques. It&#39;s time to tape over those mikes on your &quot;Smart TV&quot;. <br><br>.<br>And as much as it pains me to say, maybe it is past time for the government to step in start creating minimum security standards / regulations for various devices.

When I shone a bright light on it, I could hear a faint buzzing. Turns out that my flashlight (a RovyVon Aurora A3) uses PWM to drive the LED even in the highest setting. The black tin-foil was reacting to the light, and was in turn vibrating. I assume that when the light hits the black soot, the soot absorbs almost all the energy and heats up quickly. It then causes the air to heat up super quickly as well. When the light is removed, the soot and air cool down super quickly too. This could cause tiny pressure waves which are strong enough to be heard. I assume that something simmilar happens to the mics in our devices, since all of the ones you showed were either black or dark colored.", "comment_date": "2019-12-26T17:45:42Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Nyan !", "comment_text": "Correct me if i&#39;m wrong, but the idea of transferring data through lasers is already created, right?

I.e. it takes voice speech  pressure patterns and mimics those pressure patterns effects against the sensitive diaphragm with light to spoof it into thinking that light pressure is sound pressure.

This was a very clever experiment. Very fun to watch and learn. When I was a younger student, we were bouncing lasers off of windows, vibrating from people talking in the room, to a receptor back at my location to hear that conversation. Not surprised lasers could induce a microphone or MEMS. The countermeasure to our experiments was to play music in the room very close to the window so the music would be all that was discernable via the reflections. In this case, keep devices away from windows. The cost of this is approach however is cost-prohibitive. A much cheaper approach and most likely what a burglar would do is use a car jack to spread your door jam open just enough to get your door open without ever needing to unlock the lock. As a future SED, try bouncing lasers off of things to see if conversations can be picked up. That could open some eyes too!<br>In my opinion, the bigger threat of &quot;smart&quot; devices and the ears we put in our homes and private lives is the personal data collection that is happening without us even being aware.
