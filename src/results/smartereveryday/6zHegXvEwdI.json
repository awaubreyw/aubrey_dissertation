My girlfriend saved my life last night. This is a selfie I took in the emergency room after having a severe allergic reaction to almonds. I went into anaphylaxis, meaning my face, my lips, my eyes, my tongue, and my throat all started swelling up rapidly, making it almost impossible for me to breathe. I also had a rash all over my entire body, and I was extremely red. Staying alive had never felt more difficult. At one point, my nasal passage was completely blocked, and it was getting more and more difficult to breathe. They shot me up with Benadryl, steroids, they gave me a breathing tube, and even other stuff that I can\u2019t even remember, and it caused all of the swelling and the rash to go away. Because this was a severe allergic reaction, I need to continue taking steroids and Benadryl for the next week, because it is possible that the allergic reactions could come back at any point over the next week. The steroids and Benadryl make me feel like a zombie, and I really want to take care of my health, so this will be my main focus over the next week. I want to thank my amazing girlfriend, who made the decision to take me to the emergency room the second I started feeling itchy. I was hesitant about going, because I didn\u2019t even want to believe this was actually happening. If it weren\u2019t for my girlfriend driving me to the emergency room only minutes after eating the almonds, there is a good chance that I wouldn\u2019t have made it according to the doctor. This has been without a doubt the hardest few days of my life, but I also look at them as the most important few days of my life. These moments have reminded me about what\u2019s really important in life, and it has made me so grateful to even be here on this earth. I will be prioritizing my health over the next week, and I\u2019ll post updates about how I feel. Thank you all for being patient during these difficult times.

If we make a special cup, which would push the ball more evenly over the surface, then the kinetic energy of the platform will be converted more quickly into the kinetic energy of the ball, to a greater extent avoiding the stage of accumulation.  In other words, there will be an improvement in the impedance matching of the power source and the receiver.<br>UPD: Ohh..

I think this could be  related to firearm &quot;lock time&quot;.  If  you could change the charges to electronic primed cartridges like Remington EtronX, this rebound and lag time could be greatly reduced if not eliminated.   I think lowering this time would increase the efficiency in the energy transfer from bat to ball, especially as you increase the bat speed.  In the collaboration with Stuff Made Here, this loss of efficiency isn&#39;t a big deal since he was always swinging rather slow so the ball was still &quot;relatively&quot; close to the bat when the cartridges ignited.  However, as bat speed increases, this initial bounce could move the ball further and further away from the bat reducing the effectiveness/efficiency of the piston mechanism.

Can you do a video about failure and how engineers decide something is good enough?  I feel like it would be really relevant to educators today teaching engineering in schools or parents at home.  As a fellow engineer, I find there is a point for all engineers when we realize perfectionism is just unrealistic.  Success is what you define it to be.  I taught 3rd grade science/engineering for a year in grad school and quickly learned that the fear of failure or looking inadequate is powerful.  The fear of failure is probably the main reason there is a shortage of engineers/scientists.  People need permission to have their plans not work and always an opportunity to try again.   Often educators get the trying part but don&#39;t allot enough time in their schedules to give their students the opportunity to try again.  Iterative problem solving is the core of the engineering design process.

My question is would the pixel u pick change the velocity? If u pick a pixel on the side of the ball that the bat hits first I would think that acceleration would follow a different curve vs if you picked a pixel on the other side of the ball. Same goes for the bat. If u pick a pixel on the part of the bat that shoots forward, you will get a different curve than if you pick a pixel on the part that is rigid. <br><br>I may be completely off and I accept that but just some weird thought that hit me that I decided to type out. <br><br>Love the vjdeos", "comment_date": "2020-10-19T06:15:40Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "The Solar Cobalt", "comment_text": "1st one : <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6zHegXvEwdI&amp;t=5m06s\">5:06</a> <br>Slow-mo: <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6zHegXvEwdI&amp;t=6m06s\">6:06</a><br><br>2nd one: <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6zHegXvEwdI&amp;t=6m54s\">6:54</a><br>Slow-mo: <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6zHegXvEwdI&amp;t=7m06s\">7:06</a><br><br>3rd one Slow-mo: <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6zHegXvEwdI&amp;t=9m54s\">9:54</a><br><br>4th one: <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6zHegXvEwdI&amp;t=10m27s\">10:27</a><br>Slow-mo: Right After<br><br>5th one (outside): <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6zHegXvEwdI&amp;t=13m10s\">13:10</a><br>Slow-mo: <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6zHegXvEwdI&amp;t=13m42s\">13:42</a><br><br>6th one (Outside): <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6zHegXvEwdI&amp;t=14m13s\">14:13</a><br>Slow-mo: <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6zHegXvEwdI&amp;t=14m20s\">14:20</a><br><br>7th one (Outside): <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6zHegXvEwdI&amp;t=14m32s\">14:32</a><br>Slow-mo: <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6zHegXvEwdI&amp;t=14m37s\">14:37</a><br><br>8th one (Outside): <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6zHegXvEwdI&amp;t=15m05s\">15:05</a><br>Slow-mo: <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6zHegXvEwdI&amp;t=15m25s\">15:25</a><br><br>You&#39;re welcome.

You tried to correct it by basically not making the piston system on the bat a &quot;captured&quot; system, but once the pistons released from the frame of the bat, the power generated was free to move away from centerline. Not efficient. It would be more efficient if the pistons could be made longer to maximize the power stroke on the ball...but in a specific, controlled direction. Not an engineer, just my observation.
