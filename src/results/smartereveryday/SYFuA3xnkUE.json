Next the crew member would receive 1 (one) Demerit.

On a carrier I was enlisted and I met some of the dumbest officers in the whole GD WORLD who flew jets but had degrees in MFin BASKET WEAVING.  Not really but seriously some of these dudes had some of the most BS degrees ever.. In physical education or in some off the wall \u201cnever need to show up\u201d class.  Passed college with barely a C average while they get treated like a king and enlisted members who have more experience in the Navy, more intelligence and more common sense get treated like GD children.  \u201cBe back to the ship you 38 year old enlisted first class.  Only chiefs and goofy green horn officers with the intelligence of a ice cube get treated like actual adults and can come back whenever the heck they want.. Its BS.. Now i have both a masters and a bachelors degree thanks to the navy but was too old to join back up.  Their should be an entry test for officers plain and simple.  Heck when I was in the Navy you could become a warrant officer with just an associates.  But they are still basically treated like enlisted officers even though you still call them sir and ma\u2019am.  I could sit here and write an epic length novel on all the dumb BS officers have done while their troubles get swept under the rug just for an enlisted member to get a captains masts for racing the XO of the attached helicopter squadron on foot (not knowing the enlisted person he was challenging was an ex rugby player with insane speed and beat him like he was only working with one leg.)  The XO got mad that he lost and then in front of like 20 witnesses tried making up a story about my buddy running from him when there were both witnesses that the XO challenged him to a race back to the ship (because my buddy lost his liberty buddy, which if that ever happens you must find a shore patrolman, who was the XO at the time, and you must tell the where you lost them and go back to the ship.) AND there were races that once my buddy passed the agreed upon finish line he stopped and waited for the XO to catch up.. Drunk and laughing of course because he was on liberty.. Well the XO got mad and made up and entire story and even though they brought in multiple witnesses into the captains masts contradicting the XOs story and NOT ONE witness for the XO, my buddy STILL got in trouble and it was a strike against his three strike ARL (alcohol related incident) rule the Navy adopted while on cruise.  Ive seen this many times where officers words were taken over multiple witnesses.  <br><br>Like when I was thrown into a captains mast for taking my guns out fo the armory and storing them in my barracks closet because when I was at a base party thrown by a bunch of the base Master At Arms command I met one of the chiefs from the armory who was hanging out with all the enlisted and we got to talking about how many awesome guns were in the armory and then the chief proceeded to laugh and tell me how the officers pick trigger locks and take any gun they want out shooting.  Then he laughed even more when he said sometimes they will even break weapons and put they back and act like they were broken the entire time.  I thought they were joking because I told them I had my guns in the base armory and he then got all serious and was like \u201cNo son, I ain\u2019t joking.  I just think its funny that these officers act like children when some of my airman act more mature than they do\u201d.  So I took my guns out of the armory, stored them in my barracks and was caught with them during a bi yearly health and wellness check they do on our closets.  I guess cause some dude had an animal that died in his closet one time or something.. Anyways I got caught with my guns and when I went to captains mast and told my CO why i did that he got all pissed off and was all like \u201cYou expect me to believe the commanding officer will let his officers and MAs break the rules and commit crimes against the UCMJ?  Are you saying our officers are criminals, are you saying they are dumb?  Putting MFing worlds in my mouth when all I was doing was giving them the exact reason why I did what I did.  He called me a liar and threatened to have a joint Captains Mast with the MA command of our base NAS Lemoore and bring every single MA in to interrogate them to see if this really happens.  Like any one of them would admit to picking trigger locks, taking someone else\u2019s weapon and then accidentally breaking it and putting it back like it was always like that.. YEAH\u2026 Like that would happen.. It took all my strength not to laugh in his face with all my chiefs and officers sitting there watching.  That was partly why me and many others I knew got out of the Navy.. All this BS where ignorance and blind support of your officers no matter how heinous is the rule of the day.  But at least I got two degrees out of it all.", "comment_date": "2021-10-09T12:30:21Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "desertegle40cal", "comment_text": "If he wants to truly experience how the \u201cworking half\u201d lives, then he needs to find someone on an aircraft carrier and do what is called a \u201ctiger cruise\u201d.

That&#39;s one of the reasons there is a BALL valve there, instead of just a simple flapper valve.  The ball valve can become the last line of defense against such an event, and be the difference between someone pooping at the wrong time and getting scared by the pipes suddenly banging about...  and a suddenly dead crew member dying in one of the most horrific ways possible.  <br><br>That is why the crew who deals with that system is trained RIGOROUSLY on the proper procedures of how to flush the waste systems properly, and why each toilet has it&#39;s own set and regimented procedure for flushing it.  It is also why the showers and sinks also have their own set of pipes and valves as well, that are NOT common connected like they would be in a house.  The systems are separated to a point, and beyond THAT point, downstream if you will, they are common connected, but the pipes leading up to that point are all separate.", "comment_date": "2021-05-12T16:45:58Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "SchimShady12", "comment_text": "I love cribbage.

That would have me paranoid to use the toilet! I heard that those old U boats were a lot more complicated to use the toilet than any submarine of today! I think the hardest thing about being on a sub would have to be being under water and not seeing the outside world for long stretches at a time! Clostifobia probably misspelled but being inside of the sub knowing that you can&#39;t just surface to get some fresh air would probably freak me out a bit! The only good thing is that the new  subs are not tiny on the inside like the old WW2 diesel submarine! I remember walking thru the USS Drum and omg talk about small! Even the captain&#39;s quarters were like the close in my house. Besides the torpedo rooms it seemed like the biggest room in the sub was where you eat in the Drum! What&#39;s even crazier than that is the U boats which were much smaller! I imagine that you wouldn&#39;t even know that there is a war going on unless you are being attacked or you are the ones attacking other than that you would probably just feel like another day at work! I also took a tour of the USS Alabama which was awesome! That ship had plenty of room and the cafeteria in the Alabama was huge just like the food line! The one ship on my bucket list is a Aircraft Carrier! I would love to take a tour on board a carrier! People say that they are like a little city with clothing shops and the difference shops on board!

Forks are for waffles, spoons are for ice cream, and putting them together is every kind of wrong.<br><br>2. Both taste better separately. Waffles need to be served piping hot. Cold waffles are yucky. Ice cream on a hot waffle becomes soup in nothing flat, and runs everywhere but on the waffle.  Cold waffles taste like cardboard, are merely a (very inefficient) vehicle to get the ice cream into your mouth, and just make it harder to eat.<br><br>Waffles are hot breakfast, not cold dessert, just like pancakes. And no, crepes are NOT pancakes.<br><br>If you want strawberry favored waffles, use fresh chopped strawberries or strawberry syrup, and you can always add fresh cream.

As a former submariner I have found it all fascinating.  I was hoping after the Torpedo Tube Crawl video which included HOW the weapons get in and out of the sub and down to the torpedo room, there might be more about how these large heavy weapons are moved around in the torpedo room.  Its probably WAAAAY too late because months have passed since you left the Toledo, but I am forever trying to figure out the details of:<br>1.)  How are weapons &quot;rammed&quot; in and out of the tubes, and what are the details of this ram system?  Hydraulic drive chain drive???<br>2.)  How are the four weapon loading trays (one per tube) pivoted from strict fore-aft alignment to the approx 11 degree angle of the tubes?<br>3.)  How are weapons transferred from the upper (tubes #1 &amp; 2) &quot;stow&quot; level to the lower (tubes #3 &amp; 4) &quot;stow&quot; level and visa versa?  It almost has to be by hydraulic hoists of some type stowed below each of the port &amp; starboard walking decks.<br>4.)  How are weapons moved from port to starboard within each &quot;stow&quot; area?  There are outboard stow areas on both stow levels and the one large center stow area per level between the two aisles.  Every weapon enters the room initially from above onto the center of the upper stow area and must be moved anywhere from there, including crossing the two aisles.<br>BRAIN PICKING:  There is almost NO YouTube video about any of this.

A few German U-boats had a more advanced toilet system installed that was basically a miniature airlock; this allowed waste to be flushed out at any depth, and eliminated the need for an onboard septic tank, but it was very complicated to use and required a dedicated toilet technician to operate and maintain. One boat, U-1206, was actually lost when the toilet malfunctioned and flooded the boat&#39;s batteries with seawater, forcing it to surface where it was then sunk by Allied bombers.", "comment_date": "2021-05-09T22:20:21Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "PalimpsestProd", "comment_text": "thanks for giving me a tiny idea of what it&#39;s going to be like when I move to Mars.", "comment_date": "2021-05-09T22:19:53Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Nicky Wilkinson", "comment_text": "You were able to take your phone with you on a nuclear submarine?!

It\u2019s funny how so many people (both on and off the boat) always thought that we had nothing to do while we were on patrol when in fact we were still carrying on as if we were in off-crew. Even though we couldn\u2019t mail it, there was seemingly never-ending correspondence we\u2019d be preparing for when we returned. And with one inspection or another basically every patrol (TRE, ORSE, etc.) we were super busy with doing the CO\u2019s report on the inspection. And then there were the enlisted evals and officer FITREPS, upcoming reenlistments and separations, transfers\u2026 all sorts of stuff. And of course let\u2019s not forget the CO\u2019s patrol debrief, which was a huge deal, that was completed for each and every patrol.<br><br>\r<br>\r<br>Sleep. I never slept as well as I did while on patrol. On the former 41 for Freedom boats, crew berthing was in Operations Lower Level. It was always nice and cool and dark and quiet. And if you were fortunate enough to be in the outboard areas of the berthing space, it was almost like being isolated off into a cocoon. It was great!<br><br>\r<br>\r<br>Showers. LOL After I left the navy and moved back home, for quite a while, I was still subconsciously hyperaware of my water usage. Not to the point of still taking submarine showers but was just aware. Electricity though, couldn\u2019t care less since on the boat you more or less had the ability to generate plenty of electricity. So I was leaving lights on all around the house while being careful with the water. Finally one day my dad said, \u201cHey\u2026 I would rather you leave the water running and turn off all the lights since the water is much cheaper than the electricity.\u201d<br><br>\r<br>\r<br>Heads. THANK GOD I never joined the 700 Pound Club, also called the Golden Flapper Club! That\u2019s what you join when you blow sh!tters on yourself. But in my five patrols, there were several that did. Let me tell ya; when it happens, everybody knows and they know instantly. The overpressure of that 700 PSI air venting inboard you immediately feel in your ears, and then there\u2019s the tremendous sound that it makes\u2026 a roar like a freight train. Urinals\u2026 didn\u2019t have them on the 41 for Freedom boats. But you know when you\u2019re qualified toilets when you can flush the toilet without even having to bend over, manipulating the ball valve at the bottom of the bowl with your foot while simultaneously manipulating the gate gave valve your hand to flow some water. hahaha", "comment_date": "2021-05-09T17:32:56Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "John Murray", "comment_text": "This is 100%  one of the BEST informational series on YouTube.
