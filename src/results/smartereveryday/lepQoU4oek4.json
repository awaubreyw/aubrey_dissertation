[{"comment_by": "SmarterEveryDay", "comment_text": "Trevor is a young man who has decided to pursue technical photography full time.  He&#39;s all in.  His current plan to grow this career via Patreon.  His contribution to this project was irreplaceable.   He volunteered to help make this video by proposing it to me several months ago and emailing me the coordinates, not knowing that we were already working on it with my buddy Matt Whitman who was miraculously able to get us access.  When I told Trevor at the end of this project that it was likely he would have several more Patrons as a result of this effort, it was clear that it had not even crossed his mind.  It is my sincere hope that this YouTube comment enables him to pursue a career in technical photography by pairing up hundreds of willing contributors to his work.  He photographs Space-X launches, and all things aerospace..... seriously...he was introduced to me by an astronaut.  This young man is legit, and his work will not disappoint you.  He is going places, and it would be awesome if you checked out his stuff and decided if it&#39;s worth investing in someone who is humble and works hard.  Also, he can print this picture for you.<br><br>Please consider supporting Trevor at:  <a href=\"https://www.patreon.com/trevormahlmann\">https://www.patreon.com/trevormahlmann</a> <br>At the time of this comment, Trevor is driving across the wilds of Wyoming without cell phone coverage and he has 29 Patrons.", "comment_date": "2017-08-23T02:27:48Z", "likes_count": 4244}, {"comment_by": "Yuttana Jittabut", "comment_text": "or that international space station big\ud83d\ude00\ud83d\ude00\ud83d\ude00\ud83d\ude00", "comment_date": "2022-07-23T06:13:50Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Ishtiaque Khan", "comment_text": "SubhanAllaah", "comment_date": "2022-07-02T09:57:07Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Cunicularium", "comment_text": "What are we watching I am so confused?", "comment_date": "2022-06-28T17:08:12Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "adam84144", "comment_text": "Does anyone know what the probability is that this sort of thing could happen?

In that video, near the end, you noticed a &#39;baffling nanostructure on the hairs of the wing&#39; you asked why do they need these and why are they so intricate. I watched a video recently about insects and how water can be extremely dangerous to them because surface tension can easily drown them.

NEVER SEE ANY CURVING DOWNWARDS SURFACE OF WATER!!!NEVER SEE A BULGE OBSCURING THE SHORELINE!!!<br>ON THE CONTRARY TO A SURFACE CONSTANTLY CURVING DOWNWARDS WE SEE A SURFACE THAT APPEARS TO SLOPE UPWARDS FOR AS LONG AS CONDITIONS OF VISIBILITY ALLOWS US TO SEE!!!<br>SO EVERYONE OF US SEE A APPARENT SLOPING UPWARDS SURFACE!THIS IS ONLY POSSIBLE DUE TO THE LAWS OF PERSPECTIVES OF A FLAT LEVEL SURFACE!!!YOU CAN SEE THIS APPARENT SLOPING UPWARDS SURFACE IN ANY ROOM, CORRIDOR or LAKE OR OCEAN!!!Try to find a street that slopes or curves downwards!!!

It was so breath taking that I forgot to adjust the white balance so the 3 photos came out bright blue. When it was over I was still so overwhelmed and I just wanted to see it again. I didn&#39;t want it to be over so soon. I had been waiting almost my entire life to see a total eclipse, and now that I have I am making plans to see the next one on the east coast.

Proof of flat earth yes, if you think the earth is flat. Proof NASA faked the whole solar eclipse. The real moon was not visible just the fake one. Proof the sun is a hologram, sure why not. If NASA is that smart, what makes you think they cannot  be watching you this very moment, after all, who actually built your computer and cellphone? Im sure you don&#39;t have a clue. By the way viewing this video has put you on a list. Good luck and go take your placebos, after all you cannot be trusted with real meds. And let&#39;s not forget you dr must report to the government exactly what meds you are on.

Her reaction was priceless &quot;Oh...My...GOD!&quot;.... I know these kids will remember this the rest of their life, I know I sure will. Im sitting here teary eyed, because its two days later, and I am still in awe. The entire trip to SC, while short, was completely awesome. <br><br>A little fact about Newberry, SC and why I choose that viewing party was the fact that they call their small town, the center of the universe.

I love how you went over and jumped on the hay barrels and just looked in wonder at the dark scenery and the bright spot in the sky. You just let your inner child out become captivated by what you observe and you make science look extremely fun, exciting and cool. Your channel is a great example of what it is to be innocent and humbled before nature as it still offers us so much. Thanks for doing your thing and having fun during such a special eclipse. Cause I hate to break it to everyone but, as an ex Occultist, I know fun is not the mood in the air during such an eclipse for some, rather gloom and seriousness settles the tone for such a ceremonial night. I&#39;ve been in a bad mood the days coming up to this date, but then I saw this video. Thanks man. When you jumped on the haystacks in excitement, it reminded me of when you walked where you weren&#39;t supposed to at Machu Picchu.

I picked my spot on the centerline based on best cloud cover predictions that morning and there were maybe 400 really cool folks who converged on the same spot many bringing lots of equipment. It was quite a star party. There was one group who said that this was their 8th total eclipse and they were so happy when I pointed out the shadowbands when they appeared since they had never been lucky enough to see them before. This was my first time in totality and it was amazing - it&#39;s something I wanted to do since I was 6 back in 1984 and was forced to stay inside with blinds drawn even though I had built my pinhole camera based on a science magazine - think it was 321 Contact.

It wasn&#39;t my plan to use this for my cameras, but I bought my solar film and glasses from a shady dealer on Amazon and was forced to put together a last minute DIY solution.  Our brains do a great job of filtering out the imperfections in this kind of glass (the dark spots and the lines), but cameras are not. I am still proud of my home made filter harness and shroud, though. If you would like to see it, message me for a photo.<br><br>2) Tape down that focus ring. I took my harness and shroud off to take an unfiltered series of photos for the composite image I was trying to get. When I put the harness and shroud back on, I must have nudged the focus ring because everything after that point (all that mattered) was blurry. <br><br>I did see the shadow bands with my own eyes and I am so glad you managed to capture it camera.
