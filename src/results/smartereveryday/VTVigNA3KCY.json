Parrots have a high toxin-rich diet and therefore they&#39;re more likely observed in that kind of behavior than other animals (clay is eaten by many animals families in tropical regions... by the way, the number of species exploses in the tropics and higher the number of species, higher the accidental exposure to toxic species too) ...

Slow-mo cameras would have made it so much easier! Memories.<br>From my understanding about the salt - in the eastern Amazon, the salts are deposited in the rain, and absorbed into the plants, while sodium isn&#39;t a crucial nutrients for plants (which is why it is often lacking in a diet of plants or plant products), it means the parrots and macaws get enough through their diet.<br>They&#39;ve looked at claylick use throughout the Amazon, and it is concentrated in the west, close to the Andes, particularly SE Peru, and this is probably because way back in the past, there was a marine intrusion in that area which deposited the salt in the ground, so while they are not getting enough sodium from plants taking it up in rain water, they get it from this soil instead.<br>Many people still think it&#39;s about detoxification, and maybe that has some benefits as well, and other people also think all these birds gathering at the claylick may be socially driven as many arrive in the trees, but don&#39;t seem interested in going down to the clay banks - and if you think about it, what better way to find a mate, than going to a place you know lots of parrots and macaws are going to gather, rather than searching them out in the big wide jungle.<br>As for the flushes/flashes, I didn&#39;t learn too much about the reason or suggested reasons for that, but the birds are certainly more vulnerable and less mobile on the ground, the larger birds in particular, and they do tend to gather in tight groups, perhaps as a herd like mechanism - more eyes to detect prey, and reducing the probability of an individual being targeted by a predator. However, I have no idea why one bird leaving (as so many do) doesn&#39;t seem to trigger any reaction in the others, while a different one would - perhaps there are more subtle signals. But in all my time there, I never saw anything attack the birds on the lick, though birds of prey flying over head did noticeably start a few flushes.<br>I&#39;m not quoting directly from any sources here, just repeating what I remember from my time there, so please forgive me if I made some mistakes.", "comment_date": "2013-11-27T08:37:39Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "baldurt", "comment_text": "Great Vid. \u00a0Thanks for sharing.", "comment_date": "2013-11-21T20:16:24Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Vidoes4Less", "comment_text": "Such awe-inspiring beauty.
