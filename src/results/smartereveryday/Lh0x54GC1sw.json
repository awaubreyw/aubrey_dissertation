[{"comment_by": "SmarterEveryDay", "comment_text": "Do me a favor and PLEASE CONSIDER SHARING THIS VIDEO.  I&#39;m a bit worried it won&#39;t be distributed due to images in the video and the topic in general.... but I believe this is a positive thing and it&#39;s something people on both sides of the gun debate can get behind.  I&#39;ve been talking to people about this type of technology and in an upcoming video I will explain how this is simply one component in a much larger suite of tools which can be used.<br><br>Are there flaws in this method? Absolutely.  Is it possible to spoof a system like this?  Yes... this could be easily tricked.... but would be perps would have to take the time to worry about it focus on tricking it.  I personally think the main benefit is providing real time situational awareness.  Another limitation is that it would identify toy guns as real guns and send a notification to authorities.  The purpose of this video is to start the discussion because systems like this are frankly already here and in use.  We don&#39;t claim to have all the answers, but we decided to use our engineering skills to try to make a positive step.  We&#39;ve found support amongst both sides of the gun debate, and in today&#39;s political climate that alone feels like a step in the right direction.<br><br><br>If you&#39;d like to reach out, we can be reached through a contact form here: <a href=\"https://www.lantern.systems/gun-detector\">https://www.lantern.systems/gun-detector</a>", "comment_date": "2019-09-29T13:20:03Z", "likes_count": 3695}, {"comment_by": "De Oppresso Liber", "comment_text": "Dustin I have a an idea which would save Countless lives of you are interested please contact<br>Me via email tot via phone", "comment_date": "2022-09-02T06:59:25Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Hanitcal69", "comment_text": "I was concerned about what your take would be and I\u2019m very pleased.

But I think you can&#39;t engineer you way out of some problems.<br><br>You frame the discussion in terms of the Second Amendment, which is a thing that no other other countries have. They also don&#39;t generally have the problem that the US is plagued with \u2013 dead children in school corridors. I don&#39;t actually think this is simple causality: the Second Amendment doesn&#39;t cause school shootings. But there is a clear correlation, and I think that the relationship is the result of the use that the Secord Amendment has, through its interpretations. <br><br>This is where the US&#39;s situation as the only country that addresses guns in this particular way becomes problematic. Without implementations of similar constitutional rights, the way the Second Amendment is used boils down to the current prevailing interpretation of the amendment. Your way of dealing with it can&#39;t be judged as aberrational or normative, because there is no class of similar things.\u00a0But undeniably, your outcomes are shockingly aberrational: other civilzed people don&#39;t live the way you do.<br><br>The interpretation of the Second comes down to what specific cases are brought before the courts, and ultimately the Supreme Court. When asked to rule on the Second Amendment, the courts are constrained, usually by the context the case being heard provides.<br><br>The striking thing about this for a non United States citizen (I&#39;m Canadian), is that that interpretation supports a hazy agreement to the premise, but doesn&#39;t examine the larger context \u2013 because the specific context of the test cases brought did not invite that.\u00a0<br><br>The NRA, and other advocacy groups have steered this interpretation, and have caused the current interpretation to be focused on an individual mandate to own a gun inherent in the 2nd. The verbiage about militias, well regulated, the temporal considerations, the historical conditions that framed its use are ignored. You only have to look at the Third Amendment to understand that these instruments are not always documents for the ages, but, frankly, hacks in some cases. The Second is one of those, but its use has changed.<br><br>Here&#39;s the basic, non-engineering problem: a sovereign state is an entity that holds a monopoly on violence. To be absolutely clear about this, a state is not an entity that gains, after its establishment, such a monopoly: the monopoly is the state. Starting with Hobbes, who the so called Founding Fathers knew the writings of intimately, the monopoly on violence is the state.<br><br>So in my reading the current interpretation, \u2013 expressed in any number of memes there for the reading January 6 in Washington \u2013 the Second Amendment is seen permitting any minority group of citizens to take up arms against a government that they, in their wisdom, declare to be despotic. This, in itself is a contradiction that the framers were exceedingly unlikely to have endorsed. And that was not the interpretation of the courts, on the few occasions that the Second found itself being interpreted, prior to the end of the Second World War.<br><br>But that interpretation of the Second is a very useful tool, in that it provides an unanswerable base to assert any kind of gun ownership at all, which is how most advocates for gun rights will, eventually, line up. All you have to do is accept the absurd proposition that a state would willingly not only permit, but encourage the preparation for, competing forces, fully armed, intent on using violence, to challenge the integrity of the entity that grants them that same right.\u00a0<br><br>Most people&#39;s, and perhaps that includes Destin&#39;s views may be much more nuanced, but there&#39;s no nuanced interpretation from the Supreme Court available: if you want to keep your guns, you&#39;re forced to take the current maximalist position. That means that many people of good faith find themselves in the same boat as some pretty dangerous people, and artificially separated by gun policy from people they agree with. No wonder the moderate struggles to be heard in your country.<br><br>In turn, this makes the gun rights tent a really big tent, one that holds the responsible gun owners, and the lunatic fringe, the Minutemen, the Militias, the preppers, and on down the line. Like the Republican Party&#39;s current crisis of direction, it prevents the US policy debate from flourishing, and seeking actual solutions, while holding the moderates hostage.<br><br>I&#39;m writing this all here, because Destin&#39;s dedication and sincerity is as always on full view, and it&#39;s great. As a person whose rationalist credentials are impeccable, I see him as someone who is not on the other side of politics from me \u2013 even though, I, like most Canadians, and in fact most people everywhere, think guns are a blight, and a symptom of unaddressed problems. <br><br>This is the problem with the existing maximalist view of the Second, for Americans. We don&#39;t have the problem that you&#39;re trying to solve. What I&#39;m trying to say is that the Second Amendment is another form of engineering, political engineering, done originally on sound engineering principles, but recently overadapted, and modified beyond its safe operating limits, and still running on the original fitness for use certification.<br><br>The Gun Detector is a response to, and an implicit acceptance of, the misapplication of basic principles, like a terrible computer patch meant to keep fundamentally flawed code running.

The fact that Destin said YouTube might suppress the video because it contains guns suggests that YouTube already deploys software to detect guns in video. This is basically the same as any other image recognition software, which is used not only in security but also in academic science for processing large data sets of images. Check out deep learning image analysis software like ORS Dragonfly for doing this. You could train it to efficiently learn how to identify anything in a stack of images. I would assume that security organizations have already developed more advanced image recognition software years ago, trained via deep learning to identify guns in images and video.<br>Also, while training deep learning software can be tedious, 30k images all trained by hand was probably a very inefficient way to do this. A more efficient deep learning training strategy is to kickstart the algorithms with some training data identifying guns manually, maybe start with 500 images, then have the software go through a huge amount of data automatically, you could even have it scour google images, or run through movies and sort the data by the confidence level. The high confidence data is likely all correct, but you should have a quick look through the results to see if the trained algorithm got them all correct, then focus your efforts mostly on auditing a portion of the middle confidence data, like maybe two hundred of the many thousands of images. Flip through the images and you only need to correct the mistakes, both false positive and false negative identification, while quickly passing through or approving the successful mid-confidence entries. Then run the deep learning automation program again to scour thousands of images automatically, and repeat auditing of a small portion of the middle range confidence data. Keep going through this iterative process, and the result will skew towards increasing the fraction of high confidence results while the count of data in other confidence levels shrinks. It&#39;s inefficient to hand-draw boxes over 30k images when with a more iterative and automated process you only need to do a few hundred at a time, a few times.", "comment_date": "2020-11-21T02:56:14Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Leave Me Alone Insert Text Here", "comment_text": "Is no one else getting anxiety from him having his finger on the trigger in the thumbnail.", "comment_date": "2020-11-20T23:51:36Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Sam Price", "comment_text": "Revolutionary new tech: brown paper bag.

Also, I can&#39;t help but notice this was almost exclusively semi-automatic pistols, what about revolvers, long rifles, shotguns, etc. If the long term idea is to be able to identify those weapons as well, would an algorithm need to be modeled for each one of those types of firearms? There is also something to be said about training a model to identify the stance and posture of someone brandishing a weapon. It is possible that a person could be far enough away from a camera that their gun does not provide enough data to the model, but if it were trained to use body posture/arm placements to help, especially in the situation that a gun has been positively identified and suspect is moving through the building.

This could also bring in people holding other things that may be similar, like different models of phones, different hand positions, different remotes, etc (list based on images I saw in the video but obviously would need a lot more).<br><br>The only big problem I see with this solution was already kinda mentioned above, whereas you multiplied the number of images the system looks through for matches, it would need more time/more processing power to speed through them efficiently.

I usually don&#39;t write any comments, but this video has disturbed me. Therefore I would like to give you the opinion of an outsider. I am a European, also an engineer, and as a European, I don&#39;t have a weapon, of course, but I had had contact with it during my military service. <br>I think that video is not from an engineer&#39;s point of view, it is from a gun owner&#39;s point of view. Why is that? An engineer would not try to mitigate the problem right at the end but would ask himself where the problem comes from and eliminate it at the root. Developing a system that can detect pulled weapons at close range is a bit like not constructing an airplane safely but equipping the passengers with parachutes. However, this comparison is still misleading because the parachutes would be even better than this system.  At least they would work to a limited extent. As an engineer, I find ten possibilities in under 1min that the system is not detecting my gun. Therefore it would be only alibi security -so, Well meant is not well done.<br>If you want to do something against gun violence, you don&#39;t have to start with the already pulled out gun, e.g., in a school, but in the heads of the people. As a society, you have to ask yourself what kind of &quot;weapons&quot; we need. You certainly need a knife to prepare your food. But I haven&#39;t had any use for a weapon for the last 36 years. Of course, you can always argue that you need guns to protect yourself. But also criminals know what to expect from someone and can, therefore, &quot;equip themselves better&quot; - a typical escalation spiral. Together with all the accidents and irrational acts, one comes to the death numbers as they are in the US.<br>Therefore I conclude, I think for the first time, that this video does not correspond to the channel &quot;Smarter ...&quot;. It would be smart to explain to the almost 8 million followers why the possession of weapons, does not lead to more security and to convince them - by setting a good example - to leave their guns behind.", "comment_date": "2020-04-14T13:40:25Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Nathan", "comment_text": "@SmarterEveryDay so i noticed most, if not all (I&#39;m not sure) of the guns tested, and registered as an actual firearm were pistols....what about rifles?", "comment_date": "2020-04-12T03:59:50Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Michael Pate", "comment_text": "I&#39;m all for whatever removes guns from history, and people settle their disputes the old fashioned way.

With saying that, let me say this. It seems like a good starting idea, and obviously still in the works, but a couple observations. First, it&#39;s quite delayed, like it cant process the data fast enough. Second, obviously if the gun is out, it&#39;s probably too late and shootings are soon to happen. I don&#39;t believe that people should be X-rayed all the time, and I&#39;m totally against that idea. But I would think that the goal would be to identify a gun before it&#39;s pulled out. Obviously guns can be quite small and easy to conceal, but I feel like abnormal shapes and lumps on the body could possinly be detected. Another thing could maybe be thermal imagery. I do work with thermals, and it is very obvious when a person is holding a gun when looking under thermals, but that&#39;s if they&#39;re holding it. What I&#39;m wondering is, If the body gives off heat and a pistol is being carried in a waistband, would that cold steel portray a cold object under the shirt or in the pocket. Obviously up against the body it will warm up a little bit, but not to body temperature. <br><br>But either way, this is a good idea. I think it could best be used sort  of like an amber alert. If a gun is detected out in the open and being held like that, the camera processes it and automatically sends a text alert with the location and maybe blurred face (in case it&#39;s innocent) but full view of clothes. That way if something is happening, people could know the location it&#39;s occurring at, leave the area if they&#39;re there, avoid the area if not there, and have an idea of what the suspect is wearing. Have a second program running simultaneously that alerts the police and doesn&#39;t blur the face. Even better if it could immediately go through a police database to match the identity and look for violent crimes in the past or if they&#39;re not even suppose to carry a firearm. But obviously it would need to ID a gun right away, have a n amazing confidence/accuracy, be on an alert system for both civilians and law enforcement, have some sort of facial recognition, and tied into police systems to run those rapid background checks for probability ratings.

If someone is running around with a gun in his hand, isn&#39;t he just a few seconds away from shooting someone? Of course it would help leading the Police towards the shooter but by the time their at the shooting there will be at least a few people injured or dead. I think it would be way more effective to do something against gun violence before it&#39;s happening. For example like we do it in Germany: We&#39;re not just selling guns to anyone but only to those who have a license to own guns. That way it would be harder to get a gun and possible shooters wouldn&#39;t have the opportunity to start a shooting. But again I didn&#39;t grow up with guns and maybe I just don&#39;t understand the point of having one. It would be great if someone of those who don&#39;t share my opinion tried to explain it to me.

The purpose behind something like this would be to prevent a shooting as EARLY AS POSSIBLE, so it should be detecting guns in anyone&#39;s possession since lots of people would be likely to hide it in the waist of their pants before using it. Drawing a gun before use only takes maybe 2 seconds at most... Human interaction with a gun detected in an individual&#39;s possession would be a quick way to determine whether that person should have the gun or not so action could be taken immediately. If someone is already holding a gun then it&#39;s almost already too late at that point... Technology like this should be able to detect guns in plain sight regardless of where they are or whether they are being held or not. This would be a bit more proactive than the decisions made for this ML model to be trained on, and wouldn&#39;t violate the 4th amendment. What if someone planted a gun strategically for future use in a school? This algorithm wouldn&#39;t be able to detect that if it only detects guns that are held in a certain way, nor would it detect a gun up on a shelf somewhere. Either way though - that gun probably has no place in the school period left alone, so detecting it early would also allow administrators to potentially learn who placed it there, and would be able to take action to dispose of it beforehand before it becomes a threat.", "comment_date": "2020-01-11T20:46:11Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "TroyGarner", "comment_text": "I KNEW this was a machine learning video as soon as I saw the thumbnail haha.", "comment_date": "2020-01-11T20:40:13Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Laureen", "comment_text": "How about the custom made rifles?<br>it&#39;s a gun but does not look like a gun,<br>maybe it looks like a phone but can shoot projectiles ..<br>a 3D printed gun maybe.", "comment_date": "2020-01-11T17:32:57Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "eli dennison", "comment_text": "For those who don&#39;t see it... there&#39;s a lot that can be done with this. .<br><br>Detection;<br>- parking lots exist... not everyone is able to (long guns), or thinks to (stress) conceal their firearms until they get into the building...<br>- hallways and other transitional spaces exist.... <br>- Facebook and other live streaming services exist unfortunately some people like to live stream this stuff... their live streaming footage can be used by police departments... <br><br>Integration;<br>- smart homes are becoming more of a thing... they control your lighting, your water heater, your AC, your garage door, your homes surround sound... why is it so hard to think that businesses churches and schools will be anything less in the future...<br>- Say school security has remote control over the doors in the building... and can automatically lock the doors to the school... that buys time...<br><br>improvement;<br><br>Being able to tell the make, model, caliber and magazine capacity of a gun from a system like this would be tactically advantageous to first responders.

If you want to market this, you need to get those distance shots too. You need grainy examples too, etc... then have another layer to determine quality of video. And then use that level. You could even add a distance system to determine distance of person, then use an alternate algorithm, then the quality node doesn&#39;t matter, or doesn&#39;t end up being first and could be replaced by a distance node. So it could reliably see how far someone is on a non mirrored lense ( and you could have other nodes for that, and automatically check for that and undo it so the system can detect it.. It wouldn&#39;t be too much to code for that, but training would require a lot.<br><br><br>edit: Tablets are getting super cheap. It wouldn&#39;t be hard to rid up charge panels on the walls with a set of &#39;blueprint&#39; or simple fire-escape inforrmation on a tablet and have it linked in. So the system would show you the overlay, where you are in one color... then where a bad person is, if detected, the screen would change so whichever room has a person in it with a brandished gun would be shown on screen. If you want those rooms ignored ( ie: picking up cops ) for the time you are in them, click on them. That was they could have instance video feedback to show where they are. They could have direct access to an overlay of which room they are in relative to them... etc... This could be extended quite a bit and wouldn&#39;t be terribly difficult to code. You could also map the camera in each room to the &#39;blueprint&#39; style info, and show a dot where the person with a gun is, in relation to the room. ( get the distance algorithm working - something to judge age.. look for common items that can easily be referenced of or feed info in of the age-range of people that visit...  all of this isn&#39;t super necessary but could help. )", "comment_date": "2019-12-24T12:28:16Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Amy L", "comment_text": "You spoke in the intro about school shootings, but then showed a device that only detects guns once they are in a person&#39;s hand, with a finger near the trigger.

Guns have been an <b>ENORMOUS</b> part of American culture for 250 years. School shootings started much more recently (Columbine was only 20 years ago in 1999). As any scientist knows, solving a problem starts with isolating the variables. Guns are not the variable that changed. Guns have been around and accessible since before our country&#39;s official existence (some 250 years). Something else changed. And, as any rational, logical, scientist would know, you&#39;ll never solve a problem without identifying the <b>root</b> cause. One of the symptoms of Polio is fever. You don&#39;t cure Polio by treating the fever with, say, Tylenol.  Treating the symptom never cures the disease. Likewise, the availability and accessibility of guns was far easier for the majority of American history relative to school shootings. Attacking gun rights and accessibility is akin to fighting only the fever symptom of Polio without identifying the underlying cause.<br><br>Heck, I&#39;m old enough to remember fellow classmates with guns in gun-racks in the back window of their pickup trucks in the school parking lot. I had teachers talking with students in the school parking lot with rifles and shotguns in their hands as they admired the gun and talked about where they&#39;re hunting that weekend. Kids had access to guns long before they started using them for murder.<br><br>My own hypothesis is a combination of kids being babied by parents (parents inadvertently messaging kids that every unpleasant experience is a life altering injustice that&#39;s worthy of a congressional complaint) combined with social media that doesn&#39;t allow a kid to escape bullying after they leave school grounds (ex. now they can get belittled at all hours and by a much larger audience by the primary antagonist(s) thanks to social media). But, I have no way to test that. My son has been shooting since he was six (he&#39;s 17 now) and has never, ever shown any disturbing behavior. His mom and I were careful to tell him countless times as a child &quot;life isn&#39;t fair. Get over it and move on&quot;.  We were not these so-called &quot;helicopter parents&quot;. When he made a mistake that was his own fault, like not doing homework, we didn&#39;t try to blame everyone except him.  I think parents that never hold their kids accountable (by blaming teachers for homework their child didn&#39;t do, or blaming coaches for not starting their kid when they didn&#39;t practice to earn it, etc. etc.) are to blame. If you don&#39;t teach your child that <b>EVERY</b> action has consequences (good actions have positive consequences; bad actions have negative consequences) then you&#39;re doing them a disservice in preparing them for life.<br><br>My main hypothesis, admittedly unproven, is kids who break from reality to shoot up a school are the product of bad parents. Children who never learned any measure of dealing with adversity, self-identity, self-discipline and self-ownership of actions.  This can be further broken down as the product of one of two extremes. Either they were sheltered so much they never learned to deal with adversity to handle their feelings leading to pressure build up that eventually explodes <b>OR</b> they were so neglected by their parents that their feelings were entirely unguided and lashing out for any perceived injustice in an uncontrolled explosion was rational in their mind.<br><br>In any event, the point stands that guns existed and were readily accessible long before school shootings became a thing. Heck, gun safes and bio-metric locks weren&#39;t even a thing for the vast majority of America&#39;s history. As a prepubescent child, I knew where our guns were and had access to them. They were in a closet leaned up against the wall and the ammunition was in file cabinet next to them. I never once considered using them against my classmates even though I was, at times, &quot;bullied&quot;. That nonsense never even crossed my mind.   Barring some unlikely, sudden change in genetic predisposition, it seems pretty clear changes in parental upbringing are to blame for school shootings.", "comment_date": "2019-12-18T02:20:41Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "RBAD RBAD", "comment_text": "Take your finger OFF the Trigger!", "comment_date": "2019-12-17T22:12:51Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "John Abbott", "comment_text": "I&#39;m actually depressed that more people aren&#39;t approaching this video with an open mind.", "comment_date": "2019-12-17T20:57:14Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Ant Best", "comment_text": "Thumbnail:ALABAMA!!!!!", "comment_date": "2019-12-17T18:30:07Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Seth Proaps", "comment_text": "When ai learns about guns by watching the matrix.", "comment_date": "2019-12-17T16:42:04Z", "likes_count": 7}, {"comment_by": "Jerett Crumbley", "comment_text": "The fact that it does go off for non guns makes this rather impractical.\u00a0 In order to create good programming for this you have to test yourself first...\u00a0 allow someone to display a various fire arm/non firearm \u00a0in front of you If you can&#39;t tell the difference with certain guns then there is no way the system can do it.

I stumbled upon this YouTube channel a while ago, and I have been a huge fan ever since.  What caught my eye initially was a video he made in which a firearm was front and center in a scientific discussion.  I was quickly able to discern that Destin (the star so to speak) was an experienced, responsible and law abiding gun owner.  Aside from the fact that he was a gun owner... He also was doing some really really fascinating videos that literally did, and currently still do... Well... Make me smarter every day!!!  Back to the gun debate... I don&#39;t know how I feel about this technology yet, I am inherently skeptical, which I believe is healthy.  My instincts are that continued refinement coupled with well though out deployment could easily result in lives saved... That said, most importantly, here we have an extremely intelligent GUN OWNER searching for solutions to help in the challenges we face in an increasingly violent world... This is a critically important point.  The hundreds of millions of law abiding gun owners in this country abhor the violence that plays itself out both across the country and occasionally in our own hometowns.  Given this fact, why aren&#39;t politicians seeking the council of law abiding gun owners in the process of trying to seek solutions to the issues of violence plaguing our country.  I know for sure that law abiding owners of the dreaded AR-15 as well as other so called &quot;assault weapons&quot; are as concerned, and in reality more concerned about mass shootings, rampant criminal use of firearms, and other forms of violence.  Politicians, anti-gun organizations, and the media need to stop attacking law abiding gun owners.  When it comes down to the bottom line of preventing these terrible events all law abiding citizens, including those who don&#39;t own guns, are on the same side... None of us want to see these tragic events take place.&quot;", "comment_date": "2019-12-10T15:13:02Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Justin Alexander", "comment_text": "What if a kid a has a cap gun?", "comment_date": "2019-12-10T14:58:25Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Jacob Hood", "comment_text": "<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lh0x54GC1sw&amp;t=6m24s\">6:24</a> watch your trigger disciple :)", "comment_date": "2019-12-10T06:02:36Z", "likes_count": 3}, {"comment_by": "Daniel Bridgman", "comment_text": "To an outsider this just seems like inventing a program that tracks meth scabs in real time. then touting the benefits of your meth scab detector and its incredible accuracy and how it is desperately needed due to the meth epidemic.<br>so the rest of the world just says to you that you should just quit smoking meth, its killing millions. then you wont need this crazy meth scab detector.<br>and your only answer is <br>&quot;I really like meth though&quot;!", "comment_date": "2019-12-10T05:19:54Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Steven Smith", "comment_text": "I appreciate you and your buddy&#39;s efforts.

Most security cameras are mounted at high locations with a wide field of view so if the goal is for this tech to be used in schools and other public places it&#39;d likely be more efficient to start training the system based on security camera footage as it&#39;s not very likely that a pulled gun would ever get as close as they are to the webcam as they would to a security camera IRL.  Also, as the algo gets better you can potentially use the algo itself to find/generate more images/videos for the training data.  <br><br>Here&#39;s another idea: Though the footage wouldn&#39;t necessarily be easy to get your hands on, if you worked directly with military and/or law enforcement then maybe some of them would be willing to share some security footage from their training facilities as these would probably be the highest density of people walking around with guns while being recorded by security cameras you could find.

If I&#39;m a trouble maker and I&#39;m going to use my gun to start problems they should know where I am or if something goes down and they need my help then they should know where to find me.  Or if they explicitly don&#39;t want my help and they want to just make sure I stay out of it instead of trying to be a hero and possibly making things worse then, again, they should know where I am.  So there&#39;s really no scenario where the security people behind the cameras should not at least be made aware that a gun, regardless of who it&#39;s attached to, or how it&#39;s attached to them, has entered their facility.  Now there is definitely merit to having the system capable of distinguishing between pulled and holstered but it would probably be significantly better at figuring that out if it already verified that that person definitely has a gun.  <br><br>And this tech doesn&#39;t need to be &quot;x-ray&quot; good to work but if someone is hiding a gun the people behind the cameras in basically every circumstance I can think of would need to know that they have it.  The only way I can see that being a problem is if the people behind the cameras are racist and the person carrying the gun is of color but if the person carrying the gun is well within their legal rights then there&#39;s nothing the people behind the cameras can legally do (though I suspect in those kinds of situations the racist people would try to do something stupid anyway).  But if we&#39;re going down that road then those problems would probably happen whether the security personnel know about the gun or not.  <br><br>If your concern is that you want to carry a gun 24/7 even if that means carrying it into a place that doesn&#39;t allow guns then A: your playing with fire regardless of the security system they have and B: if it&#39;s really that important to you, you could probably get by with stashing a tiny one in your wife&#39;s purse or in a loose pocket or boot but if that&#39;s the case your probably not making anyone any safer and if a situation does happen where you need to pull it out the algo will definitely pick it up and you&#39;ll definitely go to jail so if your willing to take that risk then that&#39;s on you.<br><br><br>TL;DR<br><br>Use VA&#39;s from the Philippines on fiver and Upwork to train the algos for $3-$5 per hour.<br><br>Train the algo using security camera footage showing guns at a reasonable distance.<br><br>Use the algo to search for images/videos to train the algo.<br><br>See if police/military training facilities will provide you with security camera footage as it&#39;s the ideal training material.<br><br>Train algo to detect all guns regardless of how they are held but also train it to distinguish the difference between holstered and pulled.<br><br>It doesn&#39;t violate your privacy for security personnel to be alerted when a weapon has legally entered their facility.<br><br>If it&#39;s a place that doesn&#39;t allow guns but you want to bring one in anyway a tiny one could probably be snuck in in a purse or loose pocket but your playing with fire in that scenario and if you actually needed to use it then you&#39;d definitely get arrested or fined rergardless of the security system they have so there&#39;s no reason to criple the system right out of the gate.", "comment_date": "2019-12-09T02:08:06Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "The 719 Guy", "comment_text": "This is something that perhaps law enforcement could use.

I mean if you brandish a weapon you are making it public knowledge anyway. <br>I will state that I carry concealed due to the fact that if I were going to become the hypothetical shooter, the first people I would want gone are the armed ones. That said, I believe mass shooters are after the notoriety more than the score. <br><br>You mention mm wave and micro-wave technology being used to scan presumably large areas. I think I read somewhere, mm wave radar can be used effectively to almost 100 yards? We are already so bombarded with energy waves of one form or another and I don&#39;t believe it is good for us and I would not rule out cancers as a side effect. Those are incidental exposures but now you are talking about deliberate and targeted exposures. Military researchers are working on and already have microwave weapons for the alleged purpose of area denial and crowd control and they do exist. I would not consent to being exposed to such invasive and potentially harmful scanning technology. Also, lest someone bring up back-scatter technology, I have never been exposed to it that I am aware of and I would never consent to its use at an airport.

I especially love how you don&#39;t want to infringe on the 4th. I don&#39;t know computer and webcam capabilities, but from what you showed us, it seems the fatal flaw in the system is range and elevation. One thing I did not see is a demonstration of recognition from elevation (sorry for all the &quot;tion&quot; words there).  If you look at where CCTV cameras are in schools, banks, military bases, and so on, they are usually over 8 feet away and elevated. We already know the range is an issue that needs to be overcome in order for this system to be effective. The next issue is getting top-down imaging recognition as, like I said, elevation will play a huge factor based on where cameras are located. And that&#39;s not even considering the firearm blending into clothing and floors or the effect it has with different lighting (soft, hard, led, fluorescent, natural, night vision).  I know this is a work in progress, so please understand I&#39;m not slamming the project, just highlighting some things to consider as you move forward.

First off, detection of an active shooter situation is already too late.  Yes it will save lives and minimize shootings, but the shooter has already reached the point of the offense.  This could be used to electromagnetically lock down a school, greatly reducing the number of exposed students, but it doesn&#39;t fix the shooter&#39;s mental state.  We&#39;re focusing too much on the tool used in the destruction instead of focusing on how to prevent people from committing the atrocity (or wanting to commit them).

Buying one box to compute the images (even if a higher price is needed) is a lot different then buying a box for every camera.

I noticed only pistols were used in this video.  Has it been trained to recognize pump action shot guns, semi-automatic rifles, lever action rifles, breach loaded double barrel shotguns, revolvers, muskets (and other black powder firearms)...  the list keeps going.  Does the system detect muzzle flashes?

I\u2019m also a cop and an amateur physicists enthusiast. <br><br>The cop part of that descriptor means I know something about guns. The amateur physics enthusiast part of my descriptor is what drew me to your YouTube channel. <br><br>Please don\u2019t use the the slide stop lever allow the slide to move forward. <br><br>This action causes undue wear-and-tear on the slide and the slide stop lever. I understand the gun manufacturers make the gun in such a way that invites you to use your thumb to pull down in the slide stop lever to allow the slide to move forward. But, if it were intended to do that, it might be named \u201cslide release\u201d instead of \u201cslide stop.\u201d I understand the twelve-year-old boy inside you thinks it\u2019s really cool to pull down on that lever and allow the slide to move forward. That same twelve-year-old boy lives in me. But, as a PROFESSIONAL physics enthusiast, you must   see that the metal on metal rubbing over and over again on that action will cause it to wear down. That wear-down will prevent the slide STOP lever from functioning properly and may allow the slide to move forward when you don\u2019t intend it to. This could result in an unsafe situation. <br><br>Instead of releasing the slide stop lever with your thumb, grab your slide with your other hand and punch forward with your grip hand. This will release the pressure on the slide stop allowing the slide stop to return to a neutral position with less friction. Tactical, this is better as well as it allows you to put sights on target faster. The best way to grip your slide is an over the top grip to give you a full-hand grip of your slide. I\u2019m sure you can see many examples of that if you search \u201ctap and rack.\u201d  <br><br>Again, huge fan. I love the technology you showcased on this video. As someone who frequently carries concealed, I appreciate how the software doesn\u2019t trigger on \u201cthrough-the-clothing\u201d views. I think there are a lot more responsible conceal carry people out there than people know. My local zoo has a sign that says they prohibit open carry. It is very specific to say open carry which implies that conceal carry is permissible. <br><br>This brings me to a topic I am somewhat passionate about. As a supporter of the second amendment, I love the concept of open carry but understand how it can make people nervous. As someone trained to do a hands-waist-face check of everyone I encounter, I know the immediate assessment I make of someone open carrying: threat. I think the software you showcased in your video does the same thing I am always doing. I\u2019m no fan of big brother or anything like what China is doing with their camera surveillance/social credit system, but I can see some advantages of having an AI driven system alerting police to someone brandishing a gun. <br><br>My hands-waist-face scan I do has alerted me to many people open carrying. I have been fortunate to have never been alerted to someone brandishing a gun. <br><br>This technology is the same hands-waist-face scan I do all the time but it\u2019s working all the time and it is focused on the \u201chands\u201d part of my hands-waist-face scan which is the most urgent part of the scan (that\u2019s why it\u2019s first). If there is an AI early alert system in place in high traffic, target rich environments that could allow first responders to arrive on-scene faster to stop an active shooter situation, I could definitely see this technology saving lives. It is the type of \u201cgun control\u201d I could see myself getting behind. <br><br>That said, I worry about the big brother application this could be expanded to. I think you and the other person featured in this video is cognitive of the fourth amendment implications that a through-the-clothing scan has, but it would not be a far leap to expand on this same technology to move toward the the through-clothing scans you wish to avoid.  <br><br>So, I feel you have leapt with both feet, inadvertently, into the gun debate with this video. I think this technology borders on infringement of both the 2nd and 4th amendments. I see arguments on both sides and I hope reasonably debate will come of it. <br><br>I hit as many likes of this video as I could. (Both on the video itself and the comments.) I think this video is a really good launch point for gun debate. I hope everyone views it with an open mind. I think technology like this can be supported by both sides of the gun control debate but I hope it would be implemented with caution. <br><br>Keep up the good work!", "comment_date": "2019-10-05T04:28:00Z", "likes_count": 3}, {"comment_by": "Nate", "comment_text": "@SmarterEveryDay, you sir, and your friend, are a pair of geniuses.

I love this tech. I love this concept. I work with cameras and surveillance on a daily basis and object tracking and analytics are a big part of that.

I think there is no reason this tech shouldn&#39;t be expanded to knives, axes, &quot;big scary&quot; rifles (I noticed you omitted those - but then YT would definitely have flagged this content) and similar weapons. I would also guess that a shooter in a given scenario would conceal weapons until they have breached a perimeter and are inside. This is something that should be taken into account and both indoor and outdoor cameras should be used perhaps at distance intervals for confirmation.

Pistols are especially difficult to control because a slight turn of the wrist changes where the gun is pointing.

There have never been, neither lately, or time ago, as far as I know of. The closest I can think of is a terrorist act, but it is not like a firearm is going to prevent us from that.

At the same time, I&#39;ll admit it: If I was allowed to have a gun, I&#39;d have it... But still that doesn&#39;t mean I think that&#39;s optimal.

Stop encouraging poverty. Large companies need to pay employees more. This leads to a reduction in desperation and willingness to commit crimes. It also gives a &quot;i have a good life why would i endanger it?&quot; Mindset to the individual, Vs. The mindset of a criminal &quot; I have nothing to lose, so why not?&quot; Even in countries with full gun bans they still have violent crimes, more of wich are concentrated in poor regions. Coincidence? I think not.<br><br>2 Teach everyone how to fight. There is a reason respect and discipline are taught in far eastern countries through martial arts. They learn from a young age not only how to stand up to adversity but also when, where, and why to fight as well. Namely defending your life and the lives of those you care about, and not lashing out in anger, fighting defensively if you will. This mindset is the polar opposite of what criminals have, always acting aggressively, with little to no regard for their own lives and especially the lives of others all in pursuit of a selfish goal.<br><br>3 replace gun registration and control laws with a simple tiered license system.<br><br>Criminals will be criminals and break any law you put in front of them including gun bans. The only good gun laws will do is ensure safe handling of firearms that are in the hands of your friends, family and neighbors.<br><br>To that end a gun owners license tiered Class A,B, and C would work fine. Only want a small side arm? Get the class C license. Pass a written and practical gun handling and safety exam at your local police station along with a background check and your done. No registry, no restrictions on purchase etc. Want a license for heavier weapons like the AK? Get a class B license. Stricter written and practical exams should ensure those who have them know how to be safe with them and those who see this license will also know that you are a safe gun handler. If your looking to buy specialized weapons, teach others about weapons, or just want the heaviest rifles, etc. Then the A class is for you. Basically you are on the same level as a military gunnery Sargeant and can safely be trused with the biggest sticks (as Roosevelt would say) and not hurt yourself or anyone else as well as provide instruction at a range.<br><br>4  For the love of all things good in the world step up the emergency response infrastructures game. Seriously that shooting in Las Vegas was devastating yet despite the severity of that situation it took some ~15-20 minutes before responders were on the scene. That is pathetic. In a life-death situation every second matters and minutes feel like hours. The dispatchers need the latest equipment available not whatever 90&#39;s cord phone was lying around a thrift shop. A.I. could also provide assistance with public security camera feeds searching for and identifying hostiles and helping handle high call loads more quickly than a human could and route law enforcement, and hospital crews accordingly providing information in real time so they don&#39;t walk-in on a situation blind. Integration of cell phones with cameras, microphones, and GPS could also help give law enforcement more eyes and ears as well as function to warn paserby of a threat or help keep track of where everyone is in a chaotic situation.<br><br>But let&#39;s be real here.

It&#39;s violent crime. Also, violent crime isn&#39;t usually committed by people who have concealed weapons. It&#39;s by people who already have weapons visible, and they take it upon themselves to make their presence and intent known to pretty much everyone who&#39;s on scene. That computer isn&#39;t a security system. It&#39;s a system that&#39;d assist in the summary identification, oppression (and banning from commercial establishments) of armed persons AFTER a gun is already out and likely being used, no matter what the intents are of the people with those guns. I say we should be allowed to not only possess, but to deploy our guns for defensive use without fear of retaliation. That device is actually a risk to public safety and not any practical, fast enough tool to be used to defend against an active murderer situation. I say assailant or active murderer VS gunman, potential threat or active shooter, because I like facts and truth, not divisive innuendo and baseless assumptions. Not every person with a gun in hand is using it to assault or murder anybody. Now, if you&#39;re machine can tell the difference with more reliability, I&#39;d like to see that aspect of it&#39;s programming. It&#39;d be quite a thing if machines detect malicious and murderous undertones, without giving false positives for defensive intent with similar emotional undertones. Then maybe this system would be something I&#39;d support, and not boycott any store or move out of a city for using. It&#39;d completely mess up 1 aspect of my deadly defense plan against violent crimes in public. <br><br><br><br>I can best sum up that plan in 4 steps, which should take no more than 4 seconds during a defensive incident:<br>1, see that a violent crime likely to result in death is actually taking place, and be reasonably sure about who&#39;s committing it.<br>2, draw my own weapon, fire twice at the assailant, put my weapon away and begin retreat with body armor on my back under my shirt or in my grocery backpack. Friendly fire is not something I&#39;d want to draw, and this limited action both puts rounds into the murderer, could stop or slow down the assailant, and leave a non-confusing window open for somebody else to step up and focus on putting more rounds into the assailant in what I&#39;d hope would also be a discrete manner if the murderer isn&#39;t stopped by me.<br>3, make an anonymous report via police tip-line of my use of force in defense of self or another, because a lot of cops don&#39;t like seeing people defend themselves and there are actually procedures that treat innocent people like criminals 1st thing. I&#39;d like to avoid that undue hassle if at all possible and lawful.<br>4, hope nobody with a keen enough eye reviews quality security cam footage to let the gun-grabbers, store managers or any of the more oppressive police officers know I&#39;m at all involved in using a gun to stop an active murderer like that. If it happens in a place with a no gun sign, I still don&#39;t need or deserve the sort of trouble that might bring. The way I see it, out of sight, out of mind, and it could be that simple. <br><br><br><br>Around 9% of the population are like me on this issue. Around 5% of other people in the US feed into the unconstitutional handgun carry permit system. Less than 1% of the US population are cops. That&#39;s already only around 15% of the US population that&#39;d be willing and able to defend themselves and others against violent crimes. In &quot;gun free&quot; zones, that figure would be much lower. What your device in it&#39;s current configurestion would do, is remove more security from places, making those places 9% or more insecure than they&#39;d otherwise be. It wouldn&#39;t do anything significantly more to stop violent crime, or help cops respond any better. Cops who&#39;d shoot suspects on scene don&#39;t review security cameras before just shooting somebody they view as an armed and dangerous suspect (that cell phone thing), or as somebody (even an obvious security guard performing a citizens arrest like the late Jemel Roberson) who has a weapon and might get in their way, in the heat of the moment. By the time cops arrive on scene in response to a 911 call, many of the people who stay behind and either can&#39;t or don&#39;t retreat are killed or injured. This is why your device, sadly, won&#39;t save any lives on the scene&#39;s those are installed. In my fact-based opinion, that security device is far from ready for marketing in it&#39;s current configuration, except as a gimmick at best and security risk/liability at worst. 1 thing I think most people could relate to, is that it&#39;d summarily indicate that police officers already on scene, or anybody at a firing range or plinking with a BB gun in view of a camera,  as a blatantly false-positive threat as well. 1 of the pitfalls of supporting an Orwellian dystopia, is that there&#39;s no 100% effective security measure, and that the harder you try to perfect something that by it&#39;s nature can&#39;t be perfected, the more additional problems those efforts seem to create.", "comment_date": "2019-10-03T13:14:35Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "English Guy", "comment_text": "This is fantastic.. schools in the US can have this everywhere, where you have a large campus and an active shooter, allows an alarm to go off etc. It&#39;s not finished, but some big business picks this up, it could really help the USA keep guns, but protect people.", "comment_date": "2019-10-03T12:56:14Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Tom Stern", "comment_text": "I would say that if you are alerted about the gun once it is out you are late.

Pork, is murdered pig Sir. The technology to differentiate between pig DNA and human DNA is one of humanity&#39;s more recent scientific discoveries and until very recently determining pig DNA from human DNA was out of our realm of capabilities. Pigs and humans are soo similar in fact that when you look at one in the eyes, human eyes look back at you and corneas, livers, valves etc. are practically interchangeable with humans in transplant. Therefore, it can honestly be said, that the consumption of pork is the closest that humans can get to cannibalism without actually consuming the flesh of other humans.

No, why? Well, haven&#39;t you ever heard the saying, &quot;You can run but, you can&#39;t hide&quot;? That applies here, so, with this technology it can detect a firearm in someones hand and relay the information. Well, to whom is it being relayed? Relay it to everyone in the building, maybe through a mobile app, or have an internal video feed in every room/ hallway, broadcast the information with a map overlay like you just did perhaps.<br> Why would this be beneficial for civilians and not just law enforcement? It would be beneficial because there are only two ways out of a shooting, either kill the bad guy, or run as fast and as far away from the gunman. It gives those with the fight mentality the ability to acquire their &quot;target&quot; without having to go out and search for them.

In Kansas we have a system called &quot;ALICE,&quot; which is an all-around better system. My father was actually recently at a school, teaching, when an active shooter entered the building. He was forced to lock down his room and barricade the door, but the things that they had to barricade the door with could easily be moved, there wasn&#39;t enough weight. That&#39;s a typical school response whenever an active shooter enters the building. Unfortunately, this means you are locked in the building WITH the shooter. What ALICE attempts to do is remove as many people from the building as safely as possible. If you haven&#39;t researched it, I suggest you look it up. Luckily only 2 people were injured in the shooting my dad was involved in, but I do believe if they implemented ALICE that it wouldn&#39;t have taken as long to locate the shooters, and it wouldn&#39;t have taken as long for my father to contact my stepmother, both of which are extremely critical in these kinds of situations.", "comment_date": "2019-10-02T12:35:15Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "interanaut", "comment_text": "How dumb yoi people are...?

So many elctrical tools would, I presume, look more like a gun. This system on a hardware store (where it could otherwise, as in any store, be very useful) would go completely crazy, and so would any security guard that might be looking at the &quot;detections&quot;...<br>Speaking of the &quot;security guard&quot;, there is also the concern of over-automation: would the system only flash a warning so a human would check it or ... would it trigger something more automatic (instant sirens, instant call to the police, ...)?...<br>There are also other things that would look like a gun: hair-driers for instance. I&#39;m not even trying to come up with stuff, they&#39;re just effortlessly popping on my head...<br>Also, on the guns themselves, I noticed only handguns were appearing. But there has been gun violence with rifles, shotguns, ...<br><br>There is also one last problem I can think of, which actually also makes me think of a positive potential. First the negative: I agree that, where guns are allowed to be carried, looking for guns that are being carried, but not drawn out, should not happen. However, if the gun is already drawn out, how much time do you have to prevent the person with the gun from fire it? Seems a bit pointless.<br><br><br>However, a benefit occurred to me: It&#39;s a dark thought, and I&#39;d presume a sort of unlikely occurrence, but I think it could be useful for forensic police work in a particular type of situation. For instance, if a dead body were to be found, with bullet wound(s), but it had been moved from the place it had been shot at. Looking for evidence of the shooting on hours of (possibly) many surveillance cameras in the area might be a near impossible task (again, I&#39;d presume). But if one of these cameras would have spotted a gun drawn out (using this system), and recorded the video and the time, then it would be much quicker to look only at those small periods of time and therefore view the shooting and possibly identify the shooter.<br>And now I think of it, it could even be useful to save lives, in the case of a kidnap at gun point.

It also implies a system of morality that just does not exist in the U.S. nor most other places, that is the train of thought that it should not detect holstered weapons for the only people who holster their guns are law enforcement. This sets up the notion that one, the action of a officer is of no concern to us, and that anyone with a holstered weapon should be considered a non threat. Now I understand that it is probably an easier to teach system when consulting gestural actions into play of what is currently a threat, however in the long run it seems you&#39;ve just created a system that would only be useful to in progress shootings. No we shouldn&#39;t go full Minority Report, however I think the more beneficial information in terms of prevention would be that of identifying whose person has a gun on them, before they pull it out and start shooting. And yes, I think that should apply to anyone. If a system can identify every person actively carrying, legally or otherwise, that is pertinent information in crisis prevention. Profiling happens far too often to people carrying nothing at all, I think those with guns could withstand having their secret out to the private eyes of the government.

In the case of fire, those prebuilt warnings are built beforehand into the system and tied via RS-232 directly into the alarm system. When a fire is detected by the fire systems, the signs instnatly change to the precanned warning.  If we were to tie directly to data sources from the gun detection system it can instantly trigger those sigange systems to alert the facility or facilities about the active shooter and the location data, just like it would for fire alarms. We could also make alarm triggering contingent on confidence level, so 80% or above triggers the screen, below 80% does not.

I would be willing to bet significant amount of money one of the primary reasons the company immediately stopped having interest in your product if it is unable to detect a weapon prior to being drawn... By that time for the people nearby it is too late. For people on scene they will have a chance, if they recognize the threat in time, to react and pull their own firearm or attempt to disarm the suspect/shooter. While the program may be able to detect the INSTANT a gun is pulled, if you assume people will need time to be warned or get assistance on location it will likely be too late for those in immediate danger. This is why prevention systems that are so invasive are currently in major use. Depending on location even a courthouse with nearby police station / sheriff&#39;s office could take a few minutes to get the closest person on duty to the scene. <br><br>I could genuinely see the use as a system to be used in tandem with most current security setups. Many higher end security systems have similar such things already being made for private markets. Facial recognition software among others is a great example of this same tech being used in a different setting. Advice for marketing and practice to the system software would be to ask locations that have high traffic (Courthouse entrances, major business entrances, industrial production sites) if they would be interested in setting up the system as a direct warning system for when things go wrong. As an example in a courthouse setting having Lantern setup overlooking a main doorway could be helpful in worst case scenarios. The moment a firearm is pulled either the security is responding to an incoming threat, or a threat has just started. At that moment the nearest law enforcement agency (or agency setup to receive the warning) would be issued a notice to call attention to the situation instantly. This means security can deal with the threat without needing to split their focus between communicating the event and the danger to the nearby personnel. <br><br>Making sure it works with existing surveillance cameras was a great decision, and the target audience will have a good use for the product.

The idea is that firearms are made of metal, so if you flag someone who has a large chunk of metal on their person that&#39;s about waist height off the ground, it&#39;s more suspicious than if you have that same response around mid-back height. There will be false positives, but the idea is that it&#39;s better to have a soft maybe than a hard false negative.<br>The main idea is that anyone who makes one of those flags is tracked via camera systems at which point it looks for other flags like if their face is obscured, if they have a bag on them. The idea isn&#39;t to x-ray everyone and see what they look like naked, the idea is to look for a particular response to a broadcast signal. Such devices aren&#39;t any more an invasion of privacy than the camera system you&#39;re working with. The groups working on them have been very careful to avoid techniques that could be considered an invasion of privacy.<br>Segnex, one of the companies I&#39;ve researched appears to have a system that seems to just look for microwave responses, making it certain that someone has a weapon with no more detail than a general outline of a person due to the frequency of microwaves being capable of being tuned to a resolution no clearer than recognizing broad outlines.", "comment_date": "2019-09-30T20:14:41Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Scott Loudon", "comment_text": "It&#39;s time for an intelligent thoughtful discussion on guns, gun violence.

So by saying no to system checking concealed guns as well, you are pretty much saying that you are not that much into safety and preventing gun violence ;)<br>IMO the best way to prevent gun violence is getting rid of easy access to guns. In every country that happened it significantly(and obviously) affected amount of victims of gun violence, plus, overall crime rate dropped. You guys want to have guns and want to be safe from outlaws using guns. It&#39;s like wanting to have a cake and eat the cake. Not doable. Strict access or violence, that&#39;s your options. Just face it. You like guns, and you like them so much you prefer to risk lives of your relatives and all around just to have boomsticks in your holsters. Time of armed militia as a way of controlling government have passed long time ago. Now you are just a splinter in government toe, annoying but not really a threat ;) But you definitely(gun owners and gun fanatics) are threat to yourselves and those who are just victims of the fact that everyone can have their own tool that forces you to also have guns. I was never attacked by any dangerous tool, have never been into life threatening situation, last time I was robbed was when I was 7yo, haven&#39;t been witness of any robbery, car chase, police intervention with use of violence. Guess what my country doesn&#39;t easily allow for citizens to have.

The problem with outlawing is that criminals don&#39;t obey the law, and that the majority of firearms used to commit a crime are stolen and already illegal. The problem with making firearms too easy to obtain or too powerful, are people who shouldn&#39;t be able to buy them being able to, and people using them in unsafe ways, or accidentally shooting someone when trying to defend themselves, such as firing at an intruder, and the bullets passing through a wall to hit a neighbor. In countries where firearms are severely restricted, you still have mass killings and attacks at schools but they tend to use automobiles to plow into pedestrians, or stabbings and knife attacks.

Why? because I&#39;ve put a lot of thought into this- from the radar side.

This kind of ultimate-position-radar-sensor is the kind of thing that can track the density of a school building at all sections, from the borders of the property, while still basically allowing privacy in the school- one human looks much like another through a brick wall.  So while this is not what you want in terms of ID&#39;ing the person holding the gun, this is very good as a starting point for knowing where the guns are, whether they&#39;ve come out of a backpack or locker or not yet.  If I were to start making this kind of sensor, I&#39;d start with a combination of radar sensors and more localized &lt;IE in the hallways&gt; raspberry pi cameras with a couple other sensors &lt;IR temp sensors, particularly, but also gunshot-detecting microphones/ &#39;glass break sensor&#39; type configurations of microphones&gt; and maybe do something like use that point-cloud data to populate a minecraft server illustrating who&#39;s where &lt;or that there&#39;s a &#39;who&#39; at a given &#39;where&#39;&gt;.", "comment_date": "2019-09-30T13:12:48Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Beni Stingray", "comment_text": "The technology is great but im not sure how effective it would be in a real life situation.

The police in both cased arrived on the scene and shot the individuals with no warning or opportunity to identify the gun as a toy. This system could cause the same reaction. <br><br><br>I would like to hear you talk about the responsible employment of this system by thinking human beings.

I realize that audio monitoring is potentially legally problematic (ie: wiretapping and eavesdropping), but acoustic firearms signatures are reasonably distinct (and VERY distinct from speech) that it might be useful. Aural detection isn&#39;t foolproof, but has the benefit of being easier to detect with fewer (and cheaper) detectors.  Another subsystem of the overall system perhaps. Plus audio detection is really only usable after shots have been fired. <br>I am wondering if this system can discriminate between things that are used in manners much like a gun (cordless drills, impact tools, nail guns (some of which use something like .22 cal. blank cartridges)).

When seconds count the police are minutes away. <br><br>That&#39;s not to say this isn&#39;t an important program, and that a complete solution is on the horizon, just that the issue of gun control raises a few important questions. I feel like we need a goal, and something more specific. <br><br>There are three conversations happening. <br><br>I want my second amendment rights to be as uninfringed as possible, I have the right as a human being to defend myself and own guns. Those that would sacrifice a little freedom for the feeling of security lose both and deserve none. <br><br>Second amendment rights are outdated, the law and most concealed carriers aren&#39;t preventing gun violence and it&#39;s become an epidemic. Talking points and a good speech don&#39;t stop school shootings. <br><br>It&#39;s my right to own a gun, and the second amendment exists for good reason; However, it&#39;s been 220 years since the second amendment was written and a lot has changed. We need to solve the problem and work together to form a community and mindset that treats gun owners with respect and also does its best to tie up loose ends with gun control and safety issues. <br><br>Most people fall into the latter, myself included. But with that mentality it seems like a huge expense of taxpayers money to put the security systems in place to monitor public places. Gun control is no longer about the types of guns you can buy,  it&#39;s about the amount of surveillance you want on you in order to keep you safe. The more we push for gun ownership the more the middle ground will be forced to push for tougher security and invasion of privacy.  It&#39;s really a catch 22.<br><br>So what should we be aiming for?   Being able to own guns but only use them in certain spaces? We already have that. Background checks?

I only ask because (as you said) it has difficulty distinguishing between objects which are held, and the goal is not to identify firearms on desks or hips. I would venture to guess that the neural network relies a lot on identifying the hand, which will be affected by skin color; edge detection will be easiest with light skin on a (usually black) firearm/grip.

The issue I have is one of premise, and it first pops up in your introduction. Have you ever asked yourself why you and so many others use the term \u201cgun violence\u201d. You used that term multiple times during the video. And while I respect your attempt at comming at this one singular problem from an engineering perspective. Ask yourself this. Why does one type of violence, worth less than half of all the murders in the United States on average per year- less than 1percent of the murders of the us per year if we narrow the numbers down to what this type of technology is really targeted to prevent (mass shootings)- have its own name.  Is the human life so cheap that it is only worth so something depending on the weapon that took it? Using the term \u201cgun violence\u201d denigrated and marginalizes the tens of thousands of men women and children that are murdered by something other than a gun. It tells the loved ones of those victims that those they lost are not worth anything because they were not killed with a gun. <br><br>The second issue I have is that the technology that your and your friend are working on, as it is presented, in this video. As it sits. You have let those same biases infiltrate your thinking with regards to this system component. Let me ask you this, should I be in an area where this system is deployed, and an individual attacks me or presents to me in a threatening manner a non gun weapon of any kind (hint. Millions of people have been killed around the world with hands and feet. They ARE weapons when presented as such) and I choose to deploy a firearms to protect myself. What is your system going to do. Even if no shots are fired, my assailant flees and I reholster and go about my business. Under the conditions presented, any gun presented for any reason is gun violence. And while that is technically true, you also assume that ALL gun violence is bad. Protecting yourself with a firearm is by its very nature NOT peaceful. <br><br>You have created a prejudice ingrained into a security system based on a threatening shape. What happens when my little girl picks up a water gun off the shelf.. or my son pulls his nerf gun out of his backpack because he is being mischievous like little boys do. What will the repercussions of your prejudice lead to? Making an entire system to react to, it\u2019s simplest terms, \u201cLOOK GUN!  BAD!

So if there&#39;s a LARGELY UNMONITORED system that can detect the presence of a firearm through people&#39;s clothing - AND NOTHING ELSE - I&#39;m all for that. In fact if you pair that with a system that compares their facial features to that of registered gun owners and people with concealed carry permits or peace officers, and again it&#39;s remains a largely automated system, only capturing data for offenders who aren&#39;t meant to have firearms in their possession, then I don&#39;t think it really breaks the 4th Amendment. People&#39;s general privacy is maintained, and if you&#39;re breaking the law by carrying a weapon when you aren&#39;t allowed to, you shouldn&#39;t have the same expectations.", "comment_date": "2019-09-29T21:29:43Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "James Barratt", "comment_text": "Guns are for shooting right.

I do not know much about the subject yet, but I am having trouble understanding how you can say with absolute certainty (confidence level of 1.00) that something is a gun. This would mean that the AI model literally is incapable of making a mistake, which is unrealistic and also not true. As you pointed out the model reported a false positive on the thing hanging from the ceiling. False positives are not uncommon in AI, but that fact that they do happen means that you can not realistically report a 100% confidence level on an object if the model is fallible (which it is and  which it will most likely remain).<br><br><br>What also interests me is how a false positive can still have a confidence level of 1.00. To me it seems that there is something seriously wrong with the model if this happens. At my internship I am currently getting up to speed on detecting cars and I also have to deal with false positives, but in my experience false positives really shouldn&#39;t occur in the higher confidence levels. If my model is 10% certain that something is a car and it gets it wrong, that is perfectly acceptable since it wasn&#39;t too sure about it in the first place. However if my model gets a false positive on a 100% confidence level I would be seriously worried about my model.<br><br><br>What are your thoughts about this and how did you get to that 100% confidence level?", "comment_date": "2019-09-29T21:26:25Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "kor'vre", "comment_text": "my one concern with the system is that once a gun is already drawn that&#39;s probably already too late to have the system have a meaningful impact.

It does less to prevent gun violence on its own than to manage an existing situation. <br><br><br>That aside, here are some ideas for improving the system you have in mind For one, your database is much too limited: the gun detector should have examples of every gun likely to be used violently in every imaginable angle, from up close to the edge of a camera&#39;s view. You could also have a detection system for guns being actively fired so the system could differentiate between people in a defensive position, and those using guns aggressively. So, the camera would be looking at the field of motion of whether known guns are taking to ascertain whether they are being fired or not. For this, you would need to input recordings of guns to show their recoil patterns as active in the system. Ideally, this system could even be used to determine the number of rounds currently in a firearm.<br>Lastly, if you want to maintain privacy in a public setting, such a product would need to be set up to be activated by an alarm, or even be small enough to be carried, and implemented into a security system easily in case of an emergency.<br><br><br> Awkwardly enough, the effectiveness of such a product depends on the existing privacy of a public setting.

While the technology and project is still developing, I understand the issue of time/resources vs efficacy/accuracy however it still appears that there are many false positives and negatives still happening at this time. I&#39;m sure with more data in the system those will decrease, however almost all of the images provided to the algorithm have been of reasonably clear shots and angles, and not from traditional low quality surveillance footage. Up close recognition is good, but wouldn&#39;t help in a traditional active shooter situation. <br>2. The only images I saw being used in the algorithm, and the only firearms used in the demonstration here are of handguns. In many of the largest and most damaging cases of gun violence, hand guns were not used. Semi-automatic rifles have been the largest culprit of mass gun death in recent years, and this algorithm fails to address those firearms yet. And while you could add those to the database, it will take many more hours of recognition and frame logging to accurately produce a viable recognition on those as well. <br>3. This program does not factor in a concealed firearm aspect. If the shooter wished to keep the situation more chaotic, or if they were aware of this technology they would seek to conceal the firearm underneath a towel, within another object, or only use the firearm out of sight from camera positions. You could then make the argument that more cameras could be used, with additional angles, but then you stray closer to the 4th amendment concern. <br>4. This addresses a symptom, and attempts to alleviate the tragedy of a larger issue. And while the effort in trying to mitigate harm is admirable and a worthy cause, it doesn&#39;t deal with the issue from a preventative stance. It&#39;s only reactionary and is only useful after a firearm has been drawn, and likely already been fired. <br><br>Overall the technology is cool, and the work is impressive. However I find it&#39;s implementation and efficacy to be weak.

Force ownership of semi-auto weapons to be more communal. <br><br>Step 1: Establish a &quot;Community Defense Force&quot; in every city, town and village. <br>Step 2: Every municipality has to set some land aside for their respective CDF.<br>Step 3: Everyone who owns semi-auto guns has to join their local CDF. The CDF is 100% non-discriminatory. Anyone of any age, gender, race, fitness and health level can join. Only those who cannot legally possess a gun, or are deemed mentally unfit, are barred.<br>Step 4: Semi-autos must be kept on site at the CDF grounds. Ideally, the CDF will use their land to build a range, training facilities, ect. <br><br>Every CDF is locally controlled. How much control the local government has vs how much control the members is decided by each municipality individually. The only requirements are that there be enough storage for every member, and that at least 1 armed guard should be posted at all times to safeguard everyones belongings. Villages may opt to be branches to a larger CDF located in a nearby town or city if need be. Firearms can be checked out for sporting purposes, or in the case of small towns and villages, to be transported to a better equipped CDF range in a larger city. If the gun is not returned when it&#39;s supposed to, the owner will get a call. After 24 hours, law enforcement are notified. <br><br>Like a persons backyard, a CDF range will be open and available to its members 24/7 365 days a year. <br><br>Pro-2a bonus: Guns stored at a CDF are exempt from the NFA and all other federal <b>and</b> local regulations (except for full auto ban). Which means you can equip your SBR with a silencer and high cap mag and whatever else your heart desires. <br><br>Buying and selling: Every CDF will have at least one FFL dealer on site to enable the purchase and selling of semi-auto firearms. All future purchases must be shipped to the CDF. Also, owners can sell their weapons individually to others (though the transfer must be done via FFL). They can also request the CDF to sell their firearm for them, similar to a consignment arrangement. <br><br>Fees, costs, oversight, safety rules, ect ect are all determined by the individual CDF and the municipal government that oversees it. For those unable to pay, their firearm will be held until fees/costs equal the value of the firearms being held. At which point they will be seized and sold to cover owed dues. CDFs may not establish predatory pricing practices (charging interest on owed dues, late fees,  ect).<br><br><i>___________</i><br><br>And there you go.

When you showed the camera the magazine port of the gun, it recognized it as a cell phone, but if you programed it to recognize different patterns, (like a barrel pointing out from a handle someone is holding) and take a photo of that frame, it could recognize that magazine port as the same one it saw in the frame it took the picture of, and it could identify the gun more accurately. One issue with the system you are using is that if someone covered up the gun with something to disguise it, like a paper bag or a shirt, the system might not identify it. You could fix this by training the system to identify a persons stance and an arm/both arms extended. You could include the terahertz technology with that, so that it focuses on whatever the person is holding. This way, it wouldn\u2019t invade the persons privacy if it is a false alarm, but will be effective in identifying an assailant. Another thing you could do is include facial expressions, both of the person holding the possible gun, and the people around them if any. You could also code the system to identify if people are running away from the person (possibly) holding a gun. To ensure that the system identifies the firearm as fast as possible, you could configure the order of operations like this: <br>Visible firearm recognition&gt;assailants stance&gt;terahertz&gt;facial expression&gt;fleeing from assailant. <br>One other issue is a variety of toy guns, such as nerf guns, paintball, and airsoft. Since paintball and airsoft guns are typically reminiscent of real firearms, and many real firearms are painted in bright colors, just like nerf guns, it would be very, very hard to reliably identify an airsoft/nerf/paintball gun as a toy, not a gun, and a gun as a firearm, not a toy.

It&#39;s overkill for hunting. I hunt hog, deer, elk, coyote, and more. Not a one of those animals have been too much for a bolt action rifle I choose to hunt with most of the time or a five shot tube-fed semi-auto. Not every shot will be great and a followup shot (or two) should be possible. A hunter who needs more than two shots to kill an animal is a bad hunter and gives hunters a bad image. They don&#39;t care about shot placement and rather fill their target animal with multiple rounds to compensate for poor accuracy.<br><br><br>The only other reason to have it is competitive sport shooting. Competitive sport shooters should be licensed and documented. They should have psychological evaluations prior to licensing and being allowed to purchase assault rifle platforms and high-capacity magazines that can only be used within the competitive sport shooting scene. No taking them on a hunt, no lazy-day firing in the country. They can only be in the weapon on a firing range.<br><br><br>The second issue is a lack of accountability . Very few of the parents/guardians/friends/etc were criminally convicted after an underage shooter used their firearm to kill people. If a gun is not properly secured and is used to kill, the owner of that gun should be held accountable. If dad didn&#39;t lock up his handgun and Little Billy kills 5 people with it, dad, currently, doesn&#39;t get in trouble, most of the time.

Dozens actually go out and shoot people. Millions to dozens. That&#39;s a pretty big ratio of people who ingest said content compared to people who act on it.

This has been shown in studies multiple times. Whenever a Walmart opens, gunviolence goes up due to a bigger availabilty of guns. Countries with hard gun laws have fewer gunviolence. This is undeniable statistical evidence.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br>1: Fact: as long as there are guns, there will be shootings.<br>If someone denies this, it proves this person/instance is uneducated, ignorant or lying.<br><br><br>IN CASE YOU ARE NOT CONVINCED ABOUT THIS FACT, READ BELOW. IN CASE YOU ARE, SKIP TO &quot;2&quot;<br>- you are uneducated: don&#39;t worry, that&#39;s fine! No one knows everything in the world and there will always be things you know a lot about and things you don&#39;t know much about. Allow me to explain: in order for someone to shoot someone, that person needs something to shoot with. Let&#39;s say there are NO guns in the universe (negating catapults or other shooting mechanism), no one can shoot someone. Same with cars: if there are no cars, no one can drunk drive or get involved in a car-accident. It is obvious that shootings are proof of the excistence of guns. But now you might say &quot;yes, but just because there is a correcation between shootings and guns does not mean there is a correlation between guns and shootings&quot;. Good point! The more shootings there are the more guns there are, but just because there are more guns does not mean there are more shootings. But shootings do occur, and they do occur more in countries with fewer countermeasures, like sticter gunlaws. Therefore there is statistical evidence there is a correlation between guns and shootings.<br><br><br>- you are ignorant: this is a problem. It is unlikely someone aknowledges he or she is ignorant, but what you are doing is you have your own opinion and then look for evidence that supports your opinion, while you neglect evidence that denies your opinion. This is problematic; this is the reason antivaxers, flatearthers and global warming-deniers excist. Maybe you belong in one or more of the se categories even. The problem there is you only try to prove your point, but don&#39;t try to disproof it. There are 2 ways to confirm a theory: either you try every single possible outcome and make sure the outcome is always the same, or you try to find 1 and only 1 case in which your theory doesn&#39;t hold. Obviously finding 1 experiment that does not confirm your theory tells more than 10 experiments that do confirm your theory. Your theory has to work 100% of the time (and there might be infinite experiments), or your theory has to fail only once to disprove it. Don&#39;t neglect evidence that prooves you wrong. It is exactly that evidence that is the most valuable.<br><br><br>- you are lying: you take benefit out of shootings or you don&#39;t want people to reduce the amount of shootings. You lable evidence that contradicts your opinion as &quot;fake news&quot; and will continue to lable all evidence as fake as long as it doesn&#39;t confirm your theory of opinion. Please move along. You and I have nothing to talk about. You are immature and can&#39;t listen to reason. A debate is impossible: you will never listen or change your mind. I hope you are happy, thanks for getting this far in the comment. Now go watch something else and come back when you matured.<br><br><br>Still with me? Cool!<br><br><br><br><br><br><br>2: Debate.<br>We have a fact to debate about. There are now 2 camps:<br>- 1 those we want to do something<br>- 2 those we want to do nothing.<br>This is the first step: you know about shootings and how many there are (roughly), the question now is do you want to do something about it. Maybe you think the amount of shootings is good: you don&#39;t want to do anything. Maybe you don&#39;t believe the cost of countermeasures is lower than the cost of shootings: you don&#39;t want to do anything. Maybe you want more shootings or maybe you want to less shootings: you want to do something.<br><br><br>In case you want more or an equal amount of shootings: you and I have nothing do debate about. I want less, you want more, we agree that we disagree, move along and have a nice day.<br>In case you think doing something against it is not worth it: that&#39;s a valid opinion. You could say people die every day. People die in car crashes too but banning all cars is devastating for our economy. Sometimes things go wrong. However I believe, if you make the comparison with other western countries out of the US, I think there is something worthy you can do. But sure this is something we can debate about! let me know in the comments below!<br>In case you want less shootings: ok we have an agreement on this. Keep in mind when you are debating with someone you often want the same but excecuted in a different way! This is something often overlooked.<br><br><br>3: Act, in case you want to do something to LOWER the amount of shootings.<br>There are multiple ways and the solution might consist out of more ways than just 1. Keep in mind: a proposition can have the opposite effect sometimes, and sometimes causes problems on other topics.<br>Anyway every proposition can be devided in 2 categories:<br>1: reducing the accesibility to guns<br>2: reducing the willingness to create a shooting, aka making people with guns less likely to use guns for offence.<br><br><br>4 opinion:<br>I&#39;m european and shootings for me are something weird. For me it&#39;s obivous: ban all guns. Easy. But I understand an american looks from a different perspecitve. Guns might symbolise freedom (in my opinion it doesn&#39;t) and it might be a key element in US culture. Let me know in the comments below why you value having guns so high. Why is it important to you? I want to understand! Maybe it is a big part of the culture which is worth the casualties. Also: banning guns actually isn&#39;t easy, unlike I said. Here, yes it is easy because they are already banned and always have been. Guns are a huge market in the US and thousands of jobs are in the weapon industry. Banning guns would be desastrous for those people working in it. I think that you can reduce that economic impact with a slow proces to eliminate guns, over a period of 10+ years. In short term banning guns will harm the economy a lot, making people less happy and due to the remaining guns that have been sold before might increase the shootings. If you want to ban guns, you will need a slow and long term plan.<br><br><br>Stricting the gun laws, but not banning guns might be a solution. You can slowly keep stricting gun laws and eventually banning them all, or don&#39;t ban them all but have stricter gunlaws. It depends on where you want to end. You could strict the laws for now and in a few years evaluate the outcome, and based upon that evaluation increase, decrease the strictness of the law.<br>For exemple: you could ban all automatic rifles. You don&#39;t need AK&#39;s M4&#39;s and all that for hunting or defending, right? You use those rifles for offence, or for actual war.<br><br><br>Limiting people from doing shootings can be before, during, or after the shooting.<br>After the shooting: <br>- higher penalties<br>-...<br>During: <br>- create your building and public places in a way it is more difficult for a shooter to make a lot of casualties. Create a lot of exits for example. Note: a lot of corners to hide behind, escaperoutes and all that is nice for victims, but also nice for the shooter to run from responding officers.<br>- Create camerasystems with AI to detect possible shooters.<br>- More guarding personnel<br>- ...<br>Note: none of the above can prevent shootings, but might limit the amount of casualties.<br>Before:<br>- making guns harder to acces.<br>- better mental healthcare.<br>-...<br><br><br>Ahh... Healthcare... Let&#39;s leave that for another day.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br>When debating, keep in mind:<br>1: be respectful.<br>2: listen carefully.<br>3: most likely you and the other want the same result.<br>4: Don&#39;t waste time on someone who just keep disagreeing. Sometimes you have a different opinion.<br>5: don&#39;t be ingorant.<br>6: don&#39;t create fake news.<br>7: It&#39;s the internet, none of this matters.<br><br><br><br><br>Thanks for keeping with me until here, have a nice day.", "comment_date": "2019-09-29T17:15:19Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Joei L", "comment_text": "Possibly a dumb question- What happens if the person holding the gun has gloves on?

I know that you probably don&#39;t want to talk about politics, but I&#39;m trying to be as neutral and objective as possible and would be really happy if you could answer. When I hear about the debate in the USA I get the feeling that there are only two standpoints, either absolute ban or absolute legality, so I was wondering what a gun owner who has a big interest in reducing gun violence would think about kind of a middle way like many countries over here in Europe have it (I&#39;m from  Germany btw.). By that I mean that you have to get a gun license in order to get a gun, this gun license requires some steps to be able to obtain it , including intensive trainings and tests. Another very big point is that you have to give a reason why you want/need a gun when registering for a license, this comes down to either being a hunter or member of a gun club most of the time. In my opinion this is a really good way, since it makes people who wanna buy a gun really have to get into the topic of owning a gun and handling it in a safe way, which prevents spontaneous, rapid and therefore in my opinion unsafe gun purchases. As far as I know, mandatory psychological examines are part of obtaining a licence too, so the currently hot topic of mentally unstable people getting their hands on a gun would be taken care of too. I think this is the best way that we know of, since it leaves people who have an understandable interest in owning a gun a controlled, but not to hard way of getting one and basically impossible for people who shouldn&#39;t own  a gun to get one, at least legally.", "comment_date": "2019-09-29T17:12:48Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Nathan Valley", "comment_text": "Sweet system.

First a disclaimer: my opinion does not necessarily reflect the opinion of other Canadians, though I know that many would agree with me. Also, in Canada, like in the US, there are people on both sides of the gun debate. That being said, here is what I think. I am ok with guns used for hunting - generally rifles and shotguns. These guns must be registered and owners must be licensed. All other guns are not needed except for security forces and defense forces (police and military). I believe in a total ban on hand gun ownership as well military style semi-automatic and automatic rifles. There is no need to own one. Now I am ready to make some concessions with regards to sport shooting. In these cases, guns must stay on premises of a gun range and would be rented out - no civilian would own these guns - they would belong to the gun range. Yes, there would still be cases where people would get killed by hunting rifles or shotguns, but ultimately, eliminating access to guns would reduce gun deaths. I think that the adage &quot;guns don&#39;t kill people; people kill people&quot; is flawed... the reality is more like &quot;not all people with guns kill people, but all gun deaths are caused by people with guns...&quot; I do respect those with differing opinions and can understand their viewpoint, but ultimately reducing or eliminating access to guns can only have a lowering effect on the number of gun-related deaths.", "comment_date": "2019-09-29T16:53:07Z", "likes_count": 4}, {"comment_by": "YF", "comment_text": "Watch dogs 2<br> /991 What&#39;s your state of emergency", "comment_date": "2019-09-29T16:53:00Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Carolina Gun Guy", "comment_text": "Are you trying to discharge the firearm in your thumbnail? <b>Finger off the trigger until you&#39;re ready to shoot.</b> Thank you.", "comment_date": "2019-09-29T16:52:59Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "cody collins", "comment_text": "It&#39;s cool technology but it&#39;s at best a bandaid", "comment_date": "2019-09-29T16:52:56Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "highvoltagefeathers", "comment_text": "&quot;Triggered about trigger discipline&quot; is this comment section.<br><br>Fantastic unintentional clickbait!", "comment_date": "2019-09-29T16:52:49Z", "likes_count": 53}, {"comment_by": "vwr32jeep", "comment_text": "Ok, but....<br><br>Your system identifies a gun in someone\u2019s hand.

You said that the use of mmwave radar to detect if an object is a gun even if that technology happens to penetrate through certain objects like people&#39;s clothes is an invasion of privacy. (BTW mmwave radar isn&#39;t &#39;X-Ray like things&#39; <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lh0x54GC1sw&amp;t=4m33s\">4:33</a> because it isn&#39;t in the X-ray spectrum... Sure, we don&#39;t care what part of the EM spectrum people use but that is like saying cameras are also &#39;X-Ray like things&#39; but uses the visible spectrum instead of microwaves or Xrays.) I do agree that we should have the right to not be subject to random searches. But if you are characterizing the use of a sensor that is specifically trained using ML/DL to look for malicious intent especially guns then it doesn&#39;t matter what it does as long as it finds the gun. You made a system that uses cameras to detect guns. Fortunately you have the safety that the visible light doesn&#39;t really penetrate clothes the same way microwaves do. But you are still capturing the information of people&#39;s faces and what they wear and social context and more. Infact just because your system is blind to seeing beyond the outer surface doesn&#39;t mean it is getting any less data. If you swapped for a mmwave radar instead of your camera you would be blind to color and specific people and more. An extreme comparison is your sensor can detect race of a human while mmwave radar can&#39;t. So I actually feel you are using a technology that is much more developed and people understand the limits of how it can be used for good things and bad. I don&#39;t think I can say the same for mmwave Radar but I&#39;m sure its bound to happen. If you are saying your technology is also not invading people&#39;s privacy then I disagree.

A similar machine-learning situation may apply here. I did see that the training images included some movie clips featuring nonwhite characters, which is good. Has the gun detection algorithm been equally well trained on hands with a wide array of skin tones? For your live system testing, such as when Destin was holding guns and cell phones within view of the camera, try doing the same (same distance, same pose, same angle) with a person with dark skin, to see if the algorithm has the same accuracy when detecting the hands holding guns. (Of course, you may have already done this, and simply not had time to mention it in this short video.) Keep feeding the system more data and tuning the algorithm to improve accuracy.

Being able to get a who and where as quickly as possible is all progress to putting an end to the threat.

It&#39;s arguments we&#39;ve all heard before, but you still have to wait for the officer to even arrive in the first place.

You said that you felt safer <i>protected</i> because your friend had a gun with him. <br><br>Here is the thing: I have never felt safer with a gun nearby. Never. Not in the hands of a friend (even the boy scout-esk, ubber careful one). Not in the hands of a police officer. Not in the hands of a national guardsman in an airport on September 17th of 2001. Not in a holster. Not in a gun rack. Not mounted on a wall. Not after learning gun safety. Not after learning to sharp shoot. <br><br>I grew up in a big city (first Chicago, then Miami) where guns were always a problem. The only reason to have a visible gun was to as a sign of intimidation. The only reason to pull out a gun was to threaten or kill someone. I believe this is a function of population. Guns are popular in the western USA because the population is low. The more dense the population the more they are seen as a threat. This is why they are less tolerated in the in the east where there are more big population centers.<br><br>Again, I love that you are searching for a solution. It is why I love your channel. It is why I love the podcast you do with Matt. I love it in this case because this problem will need a solution. We need to find a way to co-exist with guns or they will go away. Mass shootings need to stop. They won&#39;t be tolerated forever.

I do agree with your position about protecting 4A rights by avoiding mm-wave tech; however, I do think the technology would be more valuable in a setting like a school if even holstered weapons were detected. As the tech got more and more accurate, you could even mark &quot;LEO Handgun&quot; or something, especially if you tied it in with a GPS aware system that could detect if, say, an SRO was in frame. I think you&#39;d probably need to end up going down some tricky rabbit holes, especially with schools, to send the &quot;positive&quot; data frames out to a centralized point to be marked for false positives.<br><br>Additionally, I know you have to start somewhere, and webcams are a very easy and readily available tech for a POC/MVP, but low res/low framerate detection seems like it would be more valuable since the majority of security feeds are both. That&#39;s true mainly for cost/maintenance purposes, and maybe tech like this would be a driving factor in upgrading the resolution and frame rate, but as a drop in solution, it seems like it would be better if it could do more with less. More with more, might also make a compelling argument. Detecting draping patterns of untucked shirts, bulges on ankles, etc, with higher resolution cameras, it could make a compelling argument for increasing the capability of security cameras.<br><br>I love the concept here, and it&#39;s reassuring that people like you and Chad are taking the time to come up with solutions that don&#39;t deprive citizen of more of their constitutionally guaranteed rights.

You note that you feel detecting hidden weapons is an invasion of privacy and then site the 4th Amendment regarding search and seizure.  First, the 4th Amendment applies to the government, not individuals, companies and the like.  Second, it&#39;s well established that one can not have a reasonable expectation of privacy in a public space.<br><br>As an example, you have likely heard of the dude that walked into a Springfield, MO Walmart wearing body armor, an assault style rifle and handgun as a test of his 2nd Amendment rights with Missouri being an open carry state. (Right up the road from me.)  As a result of that incident and the shootings in El Paso, Walmart has changed it&#39;s policy regarding open carry, disallowing it.  The way it works now is that should someone walk into a Walmart carrying open an employee has to confront the individual, ask them to return the weapon to his or her car, and if they refuse, call the police.<br><br><br>Without knowing the intent of the person carrying the weapon this has the potential to put a person at risk.<br><br><br>With a few changes to the system you and Chad have developed this problem could be solved.  Very cool.  Let&#39;s game this out a bit further.  Let&#39;s say another incident happens and Walmart changes it&#39;s policy further to disallow conceal carry.  Several companies already do so.  Would it not be reasonable for Walmart or other such companies to employ technology that can detect weapons under clothing to enforce it&#39;s policy?<br><br><br>Also, say, one is a person that doesn&#39;t believe in things like conceal carry at all and would like to minimize interactions with those that conceal carry in public spaces.  As with the person carrying a tool concealed, should not the person that loathes such things have a tool at his or her disposal to allow him or her to feel safe?<br><br><br>For me, fun stuff to think about.

I mean yes, the fastest way probably to report an active shooter situation would indeed be to somehow recognize the gun, and submit an image (either short video or still) directly to authorities, and personally I have nothing against it, but from a larger privacy perspective with today&#39;s state of machine learning, there will be lots of false positives (see examples in this video where a light on the ceiling was recognized as a gun, and more concerning the 100% accuracy reported which is impossible so I suspect some rounding going on here), and so there will be images transmitted when they really shouldn&#39;t be. Think of it as an Alexa/Google Home situation, where there are constantly snippets of recorded audio transmitted because the device thinks it recognized a prompt. That being said, yeah you can definitely keep building this out to an even greater tool for fighting gun violence (improve recognition with synthetic training data, add pose-recognition, etc.), where I probably see more value in this at a larger scale, predicting the future movement of a shooter (or group of shooters) through an inside or outside space. Of course, even using machine learning for tactical benefit is something that is being explored quite heavily as well. What really concerns me about these projects is the nature of humans and how we always manage to go step by step into futures we do not see the full consequence of yet.", "comment_date": "2019-09-29T14:57:45Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Oria", "comment_text": "The second I start this video and see these beautiful 60 FPS, I just love it", "comment_date": "2019-09-29T14:57:23Z", "likes_count": 2}, {"comment_by": "JessIsaMess96", "comment_text": "I\u2019m against fire arms such as ARs AKs but not pistols and normal firearms in my opinion I  think military grade  guns should be taken away.

For example you decide to declare schools as weapon free zones, but only when someone draws the weapon inside you are alerted. They can walk in there openly armed and not be &quot;called out&quot; by the system.<br>That means, your system detects a gun only a second before it is used, making it physically impossible to stop its use and therefore not preventing gun violence. Looking at a trained shooter and your systems reaction time, the gun is probably detected only after it has been fired.<br>Furthermore, I would assume that your system can be rendered uselss with a few high powered IR led&#39;s, to glare over the gun and making detection impossible.<br><br><br>It is a cute idea, really, but absolutely not applicable. I get that you want to protect privacy, but then a metal detector would also intrude your privacy. And since there are more and more people trying to - for whatever reason - bypass established security measures like metal detectors or just regulations, you have to go deeper in order to ensure safety.<br>Obviously gun stores are on board, your system aims at making people feel safe around guns, eventhough it does not provide any protection. And it would justify constant video surveillance in class, which is horribly close to a big brother situation and that is awful, sounds like a lot, but certainly not like freedom.<br><br><br>And just to throw some basic questions into the room:<br>-Why should any one person have access to a device specially designed for killing another person at range?<br>-Why is one of the &quot;strongest&quot; points against strict gun regulation an amendmend so old that it cannot possibly have foreseen the devestation modern weapons can cause? Letting people own a hunting rifle like back in the day vs letting them own military grade rifles or fully automatic handguns is a VERY different story. To add to that, it is said that the allowance for guns in private hands was meant to not anger the militias that were present at that time in great numbers. Times were much rougher back then, nowadays it is mainly us ourselves giving us a hard time.<br>-How come gun violence is SO much lower in countries that don&#39;t allow weapons in private hands? They are not littered with marauding gangs or drowning in crime, they just have little gun violence because they restict them.<br>-On the topic of freedom: my freedom ends when it starts to restrict someone elses freedom in order to provide the most freedom to the most people. Insisting that everyone can own a gun makes you live in a world, where eveeryone COULD own a gun. That can create the feeling of constant looming danger, making you suspicious, uneasy and ultimately making you feel less free; in the very land of freedom.<br>That is why I really don&#39;t see any rational reason not to restrict the ownership of firearms by private people.<br><br><br>If you took the time to read this, thanks for your time :)", "comment_date": "2019-09-29T14:56:18Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Jeffrey", "comment_text": "I got a notification on my phone for this video but had to actually go to his youtube channel to find the video.

I agree public x-ray examinations wouldn&#39;t only be a health issue, we also have our constitutional right of privacy.<br><br>I fear this engineering decision of detecting guns ready for use in the hand of a shooter is easy to overcome with a countermeasure against such a visual detection. Some box still enabling easy gun handling control but visually disguising the gun itself, even just some cloth you wrap around or the infamous bank robbery setup with a gun in the pocket not even revealed.<br><br>That said and considering how fast I have this doubt I guess before you start such an effort you also got to this thought before deep diving into AI algorithms and finding learning material etc., but if I was in the committee deciding what to do with AI on surveilance, there are already very common ideas about person recognition that also have the simple countermeasure of masks, so the common denominator would become detecting the intention of persons, detecting a hostility and that can start with body language, detecting emotions. All in all, any thoughts on what exact details taken aside, a much more general detection of &quot;bad intentions&quot;.<br><br>You gave the final use case of the value for a first responder to the situation and I agree. On that topic, you&#39;d typically act after a first incident and I think it&#39;s hard to prevent that, but once you have surveillance combined with AI, the major goal I&#39;d set is recognition of the shooter and the tracking of him. And that would be a manageable task, when you have continuous footage, you can track someone, no matter, if he puts the gun away, changes clothing, covers up, as long as you have continuous video observation possibilities. <br><br>And even that brings up the &quot;big brother is watching you&quot; perspective giving up privacy. <br><br>The validity of this visual pursuit comes into play at the moment it&#39;s already too late for the first victim, unfortunately, but if you allow &quot;blind&quot; public observations to become active pursuit in the moment of a crime, you had the chance to even go back to material you have about the shooter up to the moment, so you have a lot of material to build up a very successful pursuit, maybe even knowing the identity of the person.<br><br>Public surveillance cameras and the topic of the need to give up some freedom for security is a topic quite old and with very broad material you can read up on this from the legal perspective, the personal constitutional rights perspective, the perspective of such technology in the wrong hands, etc., etc. You didn&#39;t pick an easy topic. <br><br>Overall I think of it as a positive thing to act in the direction of solving a problem instead of just discussing it without getting any further.

More than my personal feelings, the results seems to proove the efficiency of this politic : in 2016, in USA, for 100000 persons, you have 11.96 deathes by guns (including 3.54 homicides and 6.69 suicides).
