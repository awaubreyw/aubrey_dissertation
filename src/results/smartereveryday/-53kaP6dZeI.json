Once you are confident closing your soft palate, you won&#39;t panic when water enters your sinuses because you can be sure, it&#39;s only your sinuses and you can&#39;t drown from that. If the soft palate remains open while doing this, you may get water in your throat (if your body&#39;s reflex isn&#39;t fast enough to close it) and have the urge to cough, or worse, you could get a spasm in your epiglottis, because the glottis when sensing water instantly forces itself to close to prevent you from drowning! All I wanna say is that the first thing beginners should be taught is how to consciously close their soft palate, because that grants them with a safety feeling. A lot of people have an anatomy that even results in not getting too much water up their noses at all, because closing of the soft palate creates an air lock to prevent water from going further into the sinuses. Other people can close their noses with their upper lips, and some can even equalize air pressure in their noses with exhaling just enough not to blow bubbles, but also not to get water up their sinuses (even though when doing that, they won&#39;t be able to inhale through the regulator)... If there is not regulator and inhalation is not required, then a lot of people can actually be upside down underwater without getting water up their sinuses.", "comment_date": "2021-08-17T18:16:19Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Notyour Business", "comment_text": "Btw, did you served in the military?

I\u2019m not a strong swimmer, but this isn\u2019t about swimming; it\u2019s about controlling instinctive panic, as you found out, and like much of my training in the USN, it really worked.", "comment_date": "2020-11-23T19:36:13Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "MrGuvEuroman", "comment_text": "We call it sea Survival training.", "comment_date": "2020-11-23T16:56:34Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "SD Scott", "comment_text": "Yup.

I went through the same training at Lemoore NAS back in the late 80s to qualify for a joint USAF/CAF helicopter test program. At 70, I still count that as one of the hardest days of my life, but one of the best confidence builders because I know that I can most likely get out of a sinking helicopter, plane, car, boat, whatever alive. I had to do it for one time to support one program. Those folks have to recertify every couple of years. Your camera angles did a great job showing just how disorienting it is. A few things were different for me. We had no breathing devices and wore the Navy &quot;Craniums&quot; but no web gear, just flight suits and boots. We had to swim the width of the pool with all that on before we could enter the simulator. We also had an extra evolution where we wore blacked out swim googles for night simulation. Not using hand-over-hand reference all the way earned you a fail or additional evolution. Also we had to demonstrate pushing off forcefully away from the cabin to prevent being caught in the eddies of a real sinking helicopter and being pinned against the belly and drug down with it. The first day&#39;s training videos were pretty darn enlightening/sobering/motivating/scary.  When we finally got to fly missions over the cold water of the Santa Barbara Channel and later Lake Eire, we had to wear the AF&#39;s &quot;poopy suit&quot; and air crew life vest. I was just glad the helo couldn&#39;t fly as long as a C-130. Sweating in all day in a &quot;dry suit&quot; makes your whole body smell like dirty feet, enough to make you consider &quot;How bad could a sinking helicopter be?&quot; Thanks for the very vivid flashback!

At a speed of about 60mph you hit the water and flip. You get your barrings from the crash and get out of a small tight cockpit to unlatch a canopy to get out. The third was falling from a platform with gear attached to you and a parachute over you as if you ditched before the crash. You have to get out from under the parachute and not get tangled to surface. This was the hardest as all you want to do is go up but if you do you are trapped under the parachute. You have to swim a distance and avoid cords with a pack on your back and a rifle you can not drop or loose. I made it just fine but two recruits got tangled and almost drowned. Had it not been a similation with instructors to save them they would have drowned. They got five tries over two days and failed to become Marines.

If you get out of the aircraft upside down and sinking you will naturally feel you are heading up when you are actually sinking down.  In combat boots and even ditching the pack, if you can, you will still sink.

Call sign &quot;Sidecar 56&quot;(From HC11 &quot;Gunbearers&quot; out of NAS North Island) IIRC.  Anyhoo...lost 2 pilots and 3 crew while it was out doing FCF&#39;s on a new engine.  I watched as it headed toward the ship after declaring that they needed an emergency green deck because of a high bearing temp.  As they got close to the point where they&#39;d flare...two of the fwd rotors departed and the helo immediately went nose down into the water.  It didn&#39;t float one second.  It basically flew at full power into the ocean driving it in.  About a year later(and this was in &quot;Guiness Book of world records in 1992 or 93) the Navy set  a world record for deep water salvage as they pulled it out from 17k feet.  That accident specifically is why they started equipping those helos with &quot;blister&quot; inflation bags so that when they hit the water they&#39;d inflate long enough so that the crew could escape.  Anyone who&#39;s ever flown in a -46 knows that normally you fly with the rear open so as to get some ventilation.  But when they hit nose low, it immediately blew out the front windows and it was akin to opening up a soup can at both ends and tossing it in the water.   No survivors after the entire battle group searched for roughly 24 hours.

That training saved my life, we rolled a Super Stock cat racing the St Clair River Fest and the training did its job that day.  Thats one of the things i remembered the most, being taught that once you come to rest upside down and start to asses the situation even thought you have been in the cockpit hundreds of times it is now a foreign space and nothing is where you think it is. Keeping your head together is the other thing and thats what got us out as the boat sank, we were under water for about three minutes before we could get the hatch open, had to actually wait for equalization before we could get it open so we to stay focused and on air in control. Oddly enough getting out of the boat went without a hitch but once i hit the surface i made a mistake that almost cost me my life. I inadvertently blew my regulator out of my mouth thinking all was fine but unfortunatly forgot the other thing they told us that fuel from the boats vent can blanket the surface. A bit of that fuel got to my face and i coughed a bit sucking a full lung of water in and i found myself neutrally buoyant trying to pull the cords to get my vest to inflate and gasping water in and out. Tried to put the reg back in but but could not breathe. My brain was telling me i had maybe twenty seconds of consciousness left and i better make it count. I pulled the reg out and stuffed it through the shoulder of my vest thinking our helicopter divers were moments away and if i passed out i would still be hooked to the boat and had a chance. Right about then our lead diver Cley came up underneath me having dropped in on the other side, blew his BC and we hit the surface (sorry for long post here). Having had to actually apply this type of training real world real time was something I&#39;ll never forget.

We have exactly the same (METS) trainer and we have all the lay-out of our cockpit installed such as the operator console, the correct position of the emergency windows and even the correct harnesses and seat belts. Our aircraft has only one cockpit door on the LH side, 2 emergency windows and one cargo door. We have no oxygen regulators! Therefore we have to strictly follow our procedures and the order of exit since the way we train is as the worst case which could happen to us. Even including the helicopter to ditch after a successful rescue. We train such things as for example the pilot door being jammed and blocked and exiting is only possible via cross cabin through the emergency windows in the aft cabin. Which means that in the correct procedure we all wait until the airplane came to a full stop before releasing items and harnesses, then the operator opens the emergency window and gets the raft out and exists the first. Followed by the LH pilot, and then the Co Pilot on the RH cockpit seat. We always have to know where we are and therefore have to follow a &quot;line&quot; of reference points which we have to touch and get a hold upon, in case, the airplane is moving (again), or if we are unable to see (injuries, night ...). A close distance is kept to the person before to know when its your turn to get out. The worst position is of course the Co Pilot in this scenario as &quot;slow&quot; crews may need up to a minute before all are out. But here comes the best: We do that in a location where lights can be dimmed and cut so that its all done in the dark with no visual reference at all. Before the new facility had this opportunity we got goggles with blacked out glass which had the same effect. And trust me - Upside down, blind, in the worst seat - This is no joke but some serious preparation. What our instructors always told us, is that every human is able to resist the urge to take a breath for at least 1,5 to 2 minutes. In this time, no one would die if there is enough self awareness and control over your body. But if you panic - Then its just a question of seconds when you breathe in water, and just a couple more seconds until you pass out. Fighting panic is the most important. Once you understand that, you can easily hold your breath for 2 minutes in this trainer, as everyone would be able in the comfort of their homes. And then -  Its really just mind over matter. But honestly - We have to do this training once a year, and the first time is always causing... feelings...

I&#39;ve been in boats that tipped over, and I have a mild fear of water, big fear of drowning. It&#39;s surreal. It&#39;s happened to me at least 3 times. 2 times were in water that was below 50 degrees. You have a split second that you realize you&#39;re about to go underwater, and then welcome to your new life, under the waves. Instinctually you don&#39;t breathe, first of all, one of the times I was caught underneath the boat and a tree, and I have a real hard time opening my eyes underwater. Each time it happened I allowed myself to just wait, float to the top, then in the case where I was under the boat and trees, I felt around above the water, luckily I immediately felt the boat, and was able to orient myself away from underneath everything so I could get up above water. The river is rushing so it&#39;s hard to keep your head above water for long. I reached and grabbed the life jacket that I should have already had on. That was the warm water. <br><br>The cold water is such a different story. Boat tips, you go under, you&#39;re in shock. Luckily the water was shallow enough both times for me to stand and have my head above water. In both the cases that this happened, I stood there and spent about a minute just trying to breathe. (If you&#39;ve never went from being in the sun on an 80+ degree day to jumping into 40-50 degree water, it&#39;s almost impossible to explain the feeling. But, it&#39;s like you can take a thousand breaths and still feel like you haven&#39;t taken a single one.) The only reason I was stood there just trying to catch my breath though, was because I already could see the people I was with were okay. If they weren&#39;t, I don&#39;t know what I would have done. All I know for sure, is that I have no idea. In the warm water, everything was crazy. I had grabbed my life jacket, looked for my brother, finally saw his hand get above water and I grabbed his hand and put it on the boat, so he could lift his head out of the water. Once he was good, and started orienting himself and doing his own thing to fix the situation, I looked at him and said &quot;I&#39;m setting the boat free, I&#39;m going to get it back to shore.&quot; I dislodged the boat from the tree it was in, held on to it, and slowly started trying to get it back to the shore. It quickly became obvious I was going to go around at least one if not two bends of the river before I made it to the shore, but a stranger that saw everything happen had swam out while I was drifting away and helped me get the boat to shore before I made it around the first bend. If that situation had happened in the cold water.... I don&#39;t know. Someone might not have made it. Always where your life jacket 100% of the time. And do what Destin said. Calm yourself. Deliberately make one small decision at a time.", "comment_date": "2019-05-22T08:54:24Z", "likes_count": 7}, {"comment_by": "God of Pizza", "comment_text": "How many people have had to use this training in their time?", "comment_date": "2019-05-22T04:25:48Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Lilly", "comment_text": "I would die before the plane hits the water \ud83d\ude02", "comment_date": "2019-05-21T21:49:12Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Eddie Sprouse", "comment_text": "Stay anchored to the truth and you will see the light!

Got confused and had no sight of the brick, tried to reach the surface and the best that I could do was pat the surface with my hands.  Could not pull myself up any further in the water.   I guess panic must have set in as I don&#39;t remember much else other than 4 futile attempts to pull up on the surface of the water like doing a chin-up on a bar or pulling yourself out on the side of a pool.   One of the swim team members went in and got me.   It turned out that the &quot;Rescue Pole&quot; was not long enough to quite reach the half way point across the pool let alone just beyond that point.  I now know that if I had just stopped playing patty-cake with the surface and pulled my hands to my sides and then pushed on the water I could have come right to the surface which was only a foot or two over my head.

But it, along with survival school, is the best training helicopter aircrew can get. I&#39;m curious if they gave you blackout goggles. In the trainers I&#39;ve done, some of your runs have to be in total blackout, driving home the importance of having a reference point at all times. <br><br>One other point I&#39;ll make is you said the simulator is set up like the helicopters they&#39;d be flying in. This is somewhat true, but instructors at the initial and refresher training I&#39;ve done say its not to teach you how to egress a CH-53, its teaching how to solve problems under stress.

I reckon that you could throw almost any situation at me in a boat and I\u2019d survive (well I\u2019ve survived every one so far \ud83d\ude00). Anyone that can build that calm into a helicopter accident over water gets my utmost respect, that\u2019s gonna be a high stress moment that\u2019s way out of most people\u2019s frame of reference or experience. Usually I can see difficult situations on rivers unfolding, it\u2019s an environment I can read, with tons of practice and loads of miles on rivers you reduce the stress and find that getting overtaken by adrenalin or even panic becomes almost impossible, you can slow yourself down, you know that your training will kick in and you\u2019ll control whatever you need to, you have the luxury of building up a picture of what\u2019s around you and time to prepare. These guys don\u2019t get that luxury, one minute you are fully kitted up and relaxing with your buddies, the next there\u2019s a urgent and dangerous situation arriving that you have zero control over. Can\u2019t say that\u2019s something I fancy trying for real! In a pool, yeah that\u2019ll be an education and I know there\u2019s a team who will make sure I\u2019m safe, in a flaming, dangerous and probably dark helicopter over water, maybe add in being in an area that\u2019s not particularly friendly to me or my country?

I started going with my parents when I was around 6 and by age 8-9 I was going alone, which wasn\u2019t completely allowed but since I went for so long I was practically family. I was there basically every single day from noon to 8, with an hour or two break. I\u2019m not exaggerating when I say that either, every single day with minor exceptions.  I eventually went so much that the life guards gave me quarters to help clean up after everyone left at 8. I taught myself to swim more than anything, my parents just let me be and I\u2019m happy they did. Doing something for yourself is much more satisfying. I became a Cub Scout for quite a few years and a couple years of Boy Scouts, didn\u2019t quite make Eagle Scouts because I just didn\u2019t have the time. At a camp we went to 4 times a year, we had multiple days where we had two hours of swim class. There were a few rankings you could be and had to have a keychain to show what you were. I was the highest there was, along with only one other person, out of the couple hundred that were there. Being 10 or 11 at the time being better than all of the older 16-17 year olds, really boosted my confidence. Now, being 17, having my town pool shut down because they didn\u2019t have the funding a couple years ago, really hurt. Lost a bunch of friends that I made there and lost what I feel like a piece of my life.

Deep breathes. Analyze and take action. I reset my GPS and looked around for ground reference points. I turned  around and thankfully I was only about 4 miles passed the airport. I landed safely. When I shut down the plane I was literally shaking. I became more thorough in my planning ever since.

While I don&#39;t share your religious faith, I have been following some Stoic principles for a while and have been studying the Stoics more closely lately. Marcus Aurelius Antoninus had a similar philosophy by applying Dialectics to things he feared. By taking things back down to first principles and philosophical foundations, he could put things into perspective with the truths of the world as he understood them and conquer them that way. Everyone has their personal philosophy on life and things they take to be absolute truths (even if those foundations change throughout your life), and the trick is learning to connect everything to those foundations to ground yourself.", "comment_date": "2018-10-22T02:49:44Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Jarod Deislinger", "comment_text": "Man, I love your videos.

I remember opening my eyes and looking up at the massive crashing wave above me, but where I was it was calm and quiet. I told myself I wasn&#39;t going to run out of breath immediately, so I took a moment to figure out the situation.  I just relaxed and waited for everything to pass. I looked around again, the water above was calm. I swam up, grabbed my board, and headed for shore. I still think of this moment when I get overwhelmed by stuff.

I am almost certain this was a spiritual reference to relying on God in times of trouble and holding firm to God&#39;s word as the ultimate source of truth. I would LOVE if you shared more about your faith. You should not lose subscribers or anything for sharing your faith and personal beliefs in my opnion. You are an incredibly kind-hearted and wise man and God has blessed you with authority and a wide range of influence right now. I hope I am not the only one who would love to hear your spiritual beliefs and especially any advice to other believers who are growing in their faith or going through big trials of faith in life.
