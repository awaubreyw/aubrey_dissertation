The &quot;horizontal&quot; plane has far more objects for the sound to bounce off of that your auditory complex can use to help triangulate the source of a sound. The &quot;vertical&quot; plane has fewer objects. Try your experiment with trees growing horizontally and see which plane is easier to discern useful information from.<br><br>The brain does a lot of subconscious processing that is useful for the prefrontal cortex. This is why driving a manual transmission may begin with watching for visual cues like your tachometer, but slowly transitions to auditory cues like the pitch of your engine. You may not be consciously attending to the pitch of the engine, but your auditory cortex is always processing it.<br><br>&quot;Mastery&quot; is nothing more than providing your brain a series of data points which it then determines which data points are common to each set and which data points are variable. After thousands of hours, it has conditioned the neurons associated with the task while pruning all the neurons that are superfluous from the task. Take the first time you learn to add 2 + 2. The first time you hear that idea, you hear, see, smell, taste, feel, and think about millions of other things at the same time. Most of your brain cannot distinguish what is pertinent to &quot;2 + 2&quot;, but after working through it some more, your brain can begin to break the connections irrelevant to that idea.<br><br>You can also look at it like resolving an image. Pixels that cannot be differentiated are &quot;blurry.&quot; Each successive viewing of a scene helps provide more information about that pixel. Eventually, that pixel can be resolved after a certain amount of passes into what value it actually holds.<br><br>A little reminiscent of quantum mechanics, no? The probability that a particular neuronal path is pertinent to an idea becomes more collapsed the more times that idea is processed.

A stock boy at our office had a watch with a broken face and he decided to have a little fun.  He sets the watch alarm to, &quot;beep, beep&quot; every hour and hides it in the sales office.  They eventually find it, assume it is the head of engineering that hid it in their office, so they hide it in his office.  Several rounds of this later I was in the office late on a Friday and the head of engineering was trying to find a good hiding place in the sales office.  I looked at the options and told him I could hide it in a way that they would never find it.  The dimensions of the office was approximately 12&#39; X 12&#39; with an 8&#39; ceiling.  I opened up one of the overhead fluorescent lights in the center of the room, removed the cover off of the ballast, placed the watch back side down in the ballast cover and put everything back together and cleaned up any tale tale drop ceiling tile scraps.  Basically the watch used the entire metal back of the light fixture as a sounding board.  No matter how you turned your head the perceived sound position changed; it seemed co come from everywhere.  Over the next couple of weeks the two sales engineers in that office tore the entire office apart.  Piece by piece they systematically removed every piece of furniture, opened up every plug and light switch cover plate and after two years and a complete office renovation never found the watch.  Over two years later one of those sales engineers was promoted to a branch manager position in another city.  We retrieved the watch, replaced the battery and ultimately that watch followed the promoted sales engineer to an air conditioning duct in the bedroom of his new home!!!!!!

It won&#39;t cause me to re-subscribe to audible but I sure enjoy the videos. Hopefully you have other sources of income other than audible. I tried the service and realized as I listened to my first book that I&#39;d never get past the first chapter. <br><br>The narrator was so boring to listen to I tried another audio book. It also not a voice I could listen to without them sounding bored, artificial, under expressive. There&#39;s no way the voice described the story. <br><br>Just a droning voice that&#39;s emotionally neutral about everything. I can&#39;t imagine how people enjoy that sort of thing but I can&#39;t do it. I have heard people read books that read them in a way that made me want to listen but nothing from audible was like that. <br><br>So I figured if the product is this bad surely I don&#39;t have to pay for ones that I can&#39;t get past the first chapter. Nope. They only let you do that once or twice and that&#39;s it because they&#39;re all paranoid about something though I&#39;m not sure what.<br><br>It never occurred to me till now but maybe the reason they don&#39;t make them interesting is so that the quality is not good enough to share but good enough to get through the book if you don&#39;t mind listening to a dull rendition of it. That way I guess nobody wants to copy their books. I really don&#39;t know. <br><br>But I do know that I&#39;d love to listen to great books but only by great readers.

Make a cap that has tiny parabolic microphones mounted around the rim and on top. At each of the locations also place a vibrator as in a cell phone&#39;s silent ringer. Have a way to select prerecorded sounds and also a button to record a brief sound in the field that can be stored. Once the sound is selected or recorded a processor &quot;listens&quot; to the ambient noise and compares the sound waves.  When the selected sound is received by the mic&#39;s then the processor determines the strongest signal and sends a signal to the vibrator at that mic to help the wearer know the direction of the sound.

First of all, Destin is not only a bright individual who seems intelligent enough to teach his own children about gun safety, but the \u201crifle\u201d he was using didn\u2019t even seem like a powerful one. The reason I mention the power of the rifle is to further emphasize his awareness and enforcement of safety around his children. Even though it wasn\u2019t the strongest, he treated it with the exact amount of precautions and safety enactment necessary to stop his children dead in their tracks and make sure the gun was safe enough to be around before even thinking about going for the downed drone. That\u2019s called impeccable parenting - top notch if I do say so myself. Secondly, I\u2019m pretty sure Destin\u2019s children are old and smart enough to realize and respect both the knowledge and teachings of their father, as well as the potential level of threat any gun poses. Thirdly, peace and love and add a hint of responsible gun ownership and you have yourself a utopian America. Sadly, that isn\u2019t the current case.

The history of Christmas starts with the catholic church taking a pagan holiday, slapping Christ&#39;s name on it, and calling it His birthday.  Christ never told us to celebrate birthdays, but He told us to not get involved with the wicked deeds of those in the land.  He spoke this to Israel, so would it not be good for us also to learn and listen?  Would God tell Israel to stay away from the wicked traditions of the non-believers, and not tell us the same?<br><br><br>&quot;When you you come to the land which Jehovah your God is giving to you, you shall not learn to do things like the hateful acts of those nation; not shall be found in you one who passes his son or daughter through fire, one practicing divination, a cloud-reader, a fortune-teller, or a spell-caster or a charmer of magic or one consulting spirits, or a wizard, or one inquiring of the dead.  For an abomination to Jehovah are all those doing these things&quot; ~ Deuteronomy 18:9-11<br><br><br>Not to mention God even points out through Jeremiah the very act of what they call Christmas,<br><br><br>&quot;Hear the word which Jehovah speaks to you, O house of Israel.  Thus says Jehovah, to the way of the nations, you shall not be goaded, and by the signs of the heavens do not be terrified, for terrified are the nations by them.  For the statues of the people - vanity it is, for a tree from the forest one cuts, the work of the hands of the craftsman with the axe.  They adorn it with gold and with silver, with nails and with hammers they fasten them so that it will not wobble.  Like a rounded post they are, and they cannot speak; surely they must be lifted for they cannot walk.  Do not be afraid of them; for they can not do evil and not do good; it is not with them&quot; ~ Jeremiah 10: 1-5<br><br><br>The so-called Christmas tree represents the worship of Nimrod, they try to resurrect him using this tree, and the presents underneath are offerings to nimrod.  If you take a look and see, the Catholic Church took Christ, slapped Him on top of this pagan ritual, and called it His Birthday.  Yet I say, did Christ say to celebrate His birthday?  No, no where does he say to do so. I say this to warn you.   Another way you can see that Christmas is not of God, is that the world loves it.  I say this then, what fellowship does Christ have with Satan?  None.  Not to mention the greed, the lust, the jealousy, envy, and covetousness that happens before this time of the year.  Wherever you look in Christmas all you see is things that are not of God.  I do not dispute what the Word says about the Birth of Christ.  It happened exactly as God foretold through His prophets that it would.  But Jesus Christ was not born on the 25th of December.  Rather, He was born on a day that only the Father, the Son, the Holy Spirit, those around Christ when it happened, everyone else who knew about it at the time, to whom it has been revealed to by God or by those who knew of that date at the time, the Shepherds who witnessed it, the demons who knew,  and the devil.  Nonetheless the celebrations of Birthdays are pagan as it is, for the cake is an idol. <br><br><br><br>I say this in love and grace in the hopes that God would use this to open your eyes to the truth, surely He will show you that what I&#39;m saying is the truth.<br><br><br>Star wars is also not of God, for it the so-called &quot;force&quot; and using the &quot;force&quot; is sorcery and witchcraft because it is calling upon something other than God for power and authority, for God said, you shall worship the Lord your God and serve Him only.

I thought I would bring these to your attention as God leads, may God open your eyes to the truth, and lead you out of the snare of the devil.

We never fired guns, but we were taught safety and hunting rules. Even showed us films on how to gut and dress game. Not fun to watch, but good to know for when the SHTF. There were no school shootings in those days. My Senior year, I was in the Drama Club, and we were doing a play set in WWI. My Dad had two old Italian sniper rifles (disabled, unable to fire) that I brought to school so they could be used as props. I walked in the front door of my HS in 1978, carrying those two rifles wrapped in a blanket. I stopped by the front admissions office to show them to an adult, I wanted them to see the firing pins were removed.

Some research indicates that breeds with a large muzzle do this more than dogs with flatter faces. It&#39;s also possible that it&#39;s just a result of positive reinforcement, since dogs tilting their heads is so cute that humans always react positively..

Which means this recording will work when played back for the person who recorded it but will have the same flaw you experienced with your son. Every person has a different head related transfer function so they will perceive left and right spatial sounds well but in front and back or anywhere along that vertical plane will be confused. Finally, your 3D sound videos will probably have a saving grace because our minds do a fantastic job of tricking our brains into spatial sound when the video reinforces the location.<br><br>Thought this would be worth sharing and I\u2019m definitely getting smarter everyday!

I find that, strangely enough, video games have really gotten close to real life directional hearing, and this also includes our difficulty with determining differences in the vertical plane (with sound) as you demonstrated in the video! I searched on google and there doesn&#39;t seem to be any project in the works of this sort.

Both methods gave good results.

Did sound for church gigs too (youth events) and I was [still am cough cough] really good at it.  Then when I was about 23 years old, I got a cold, not even a bad cold, but a head cold.  I was stuffed up for about a week.  I woke up that morning not feeling well and my ear felt like it was plugged.  Like it was under water, I really wasn&#39;t feeling well.  I went to work (installing satellite dishes) and after a short day went to emergency to get some antibiotics as my ear was really starting to hurt.  That evening I went to bed at like 5pm not feeling well.  I woke up about 7pm and the room was spinning so fast I couldn&#39;t sit up and started heaving everything that was in my stomach, and then everything that wasn&#39;t in my stomach!<br><br>My [right] inner ear died that day.  Some &quot;explainable&quot; virus caused nerve damage.  I spent 2 days on the couch and about 5 more in bed literally crawling to the bathroom eating nothing but a single piece of toast per day.  Any movement of my head would send the room into a spin.  I didn&#39;t leave the house for about 3 months because driving and looking around would make me sick to my stomach.

As far as hearing goes, by means described in your video your brain will also filter out unimportant noise.  Things like background noise.  When you are in a crowded room, like a restaurant, your brain will actually ignore everyone else automagically for you.  For me, I can hear everyone at almost the same volume.  It makes having a conversation very difficult.<br><br>Our eyes are similar, they, just like a camera, can not actually focus on a very large area at the same time, so most of what you &quot;see&quot; is actually made up by your brain.

I was right to a certain degree since I thought you could never really know the height of the sound source under any circumstance, but my dad was also right to a smaller of a degree since he thought the opposite extreme of the spectrum; that not only can humans precisely tell where the sound is coming from, but you could also capture it with a pair of microphones. We both got some parts wrong in that humans ARE able to sense where the sound source is in all directions due to the complex systems involving the shape of the ears and the processing of the brain, and in that you need specially designed microphones (not just any) (like the 3Dio microphone - didn&#39;t think the design would theoretically enable vertical direction sensing until I saw this vid) to be able to record precise mapping of where the sound sources are coming from. I would say this is a very good example of what this channel can achieve: easily make me understand something I didn&#39;t even know how to start researching on.

For some reason my stereo hearing was completely wonky below the water.<br><br>Then I read up on it a little, and got smarter every day. Turns out that the reason for this is that sound waves travel much faster through water than through air.

Do you even know, what &quot;arm&quot; in that case even means? It&#39;s the French equilivant of Weapon (from &quot;l&#39;arme&quot;). (It&#39;s also where stuff like &quot;army&quot; and &quot;Get armed!&quot; comes from.) Yes, you try to disclaim that a gun is a weapon *even when it&#39;s part of the group whose word contains &quot;weapon&quot; (&quot;firearm&quot;)*.<br>Really, weapons are primarily designed to help on attacking someone and not simple tools.

Sure, it&#39;s easier for children to activate a knife than a gun but that aside, knives looks pretty harmless. I mean, if you run while holding a knife, you can only hurt someone by accident if you bump into someone. Even tripping is much of a problem since you can throw a knife to the ground.<br>Firearms, on the other hand, are ranged, meaning the attack doesn&#39;t need to be close for the victim (yes, I know you can throw knives but come on, throwing isn&#39;t as simple as aming and pull a trigger). That means, you can only fight someone properly if you managed to get close to the gunner. And guns can also randomly shoot on their own. Of course, these cases are rare but still, safety is safety.

Furthermore, I hypothesised a design for ear phones that could replicate true three dimensional sound for say gaming or the hard of hearing, that could reproduce this spectral content. I am of the opinion that since the dimensions of the details of the pina are in the order of millimetres, then a resolution of around 10 microseconds (or 100khz frequency response) would be required to reproduce this information for dissemination by the auditory system.<br>Due to lack of resources however, I was unable to develop prove my theory or develop any such devices. <br>Recently there have been a number of &quot;binaural&quot; presentations which purport to demonstrate three dimensional sound. All of these using the standard audio systems including the head phones. And all of these, for me, although able to give an &quot;intimate&quot; sence of presence, nevertheless fail to give clear up/down, front/back resolution. In fact it&#39;s more as if the sound emirates from between the ears or inside the head. I believe that our auditory system, whilst not consciously &quot;hearing&quot; these frequencies (20-100khz), is able to &quot;sence&quot; them and decode the information into a sence of direction. I would maintain that an audio reproduction system with a high frequency response of up to 100khz is necessary to replicate true three dimensional sound. <br>I would be very grateful if someone could spare me some time to comment on this. . <br>Many thanks,<br>Dizzy", "comment_date": "2017-08-15T23:16:15Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "kangourouuu1", "comment_text": "<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oai7HUqncAA&amp;t=5m53s\">5:53</a> : the face you <b>must display</b> when doing a dad joke.", "comment_date": "2017-08-15T23:04:09Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "TheTurtleEmperor", "comment_text": "Your sister is awesome", "comment_date": "2017-08-15T22:58:54Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Johnathan Hall", "comment_text": "Great video, I really like the little animations made in the video.

Maybe the sites of the mask blocked the sound out so I can clearly find the direction. I just can remember everytime I hear something I turned my ears to that direction. The two where also very amazed we had found them, because it was so dark and I wasn&#39;t even able to see anything because of the mask. Btw I do a zombie LARP, we were zombies following survivers.

Thought i&#39;d share something interesting in relation to this video&#39;s subject. Psychoacoustics is also used in theatre and festivals. The goal most of the time is to amplify the sound from someone or something on stage naturally, so we want the amplified sound to come from the direction that the person or thing is. The way this is done with speakers on the front of the stage faced at the audience, but (most of the time) we cant put speakers in front of that, because it would block the view! So instead we place the speakers on the side and above the opening of the stage. Here comes the trick: we can use slight delays to trick the audiences brain into thinking the sound comes from another place because with one speaker delayed the other speakers sound will reach the audience earlier thereby shifting perception of location. Also in regards to vertical sensing of sound, because human ears don&#39;t hear vertically very well (as you proved) it doesn&#39;t matter that much of the speakers are higher up above the stage.

Also when my friends called my name I first had to turn 360* before I could locate them through vision. Thankfully this has all healed now, but it was just funny to experience a loud train rail by, while not realizing that it was the train that made so much noise.

That part gets a big plus. <i>However, even with that knowledge, as soon as the drone was tumbling down towards the ground, the shooter forgot a very important rule: </i><b><i>safe the rifle before moving</i></b> .<br><br>Destin caught it immediately and took command which was excellent, but it still only takes one moment of inattention combined with something else to accidentally fire the gun.<br><br><i>And this is with at least one trained adult around</i> . Accidents happen because even the best of us get careless or lose focus at times. Life is a series of trade-offs. Some risks we accept because they are necessary for a normal life: we take a small but calculated risk every time we drive to work. We take a risk when we slice our bread. We take a risk whenever we play sports or go swimming or take a bike ride.<br><br>And we take risks every time we handle a loaded firearm. For most people this is an unacceptable risk, because the gain from it is little to none. For people in the country who hunt or have to manage their land, it might be a necessary tool. Likewise for law enforcement officers and military personnel.<br><br>Over one thousand kids die from gunshot wounds every year in the US. Five times as many are injured. Even taking into account the large number of people in the US, those are unfathomable numbers for most people in other developed nations. In the US, it is simply &quot;the cost of doing business&quot;, metaphorically speaking.<br><br>Each and every case is of course a huge, huge tragedy for the families involved. Were some of those guns necessary? Absolutely. Were all of them? Absolutely not. Were most of them? I don&#39;t know, but I seriously doubt it.<br><br>I have no good solution to what is certainly a systemic problem in the US society - almost exactly as many people die from gunshot wounds each year as die in traffic, around 34,000 people or 10.5-10.6 per 100,000 population. (And keep in mind that the death rates in traffic are between 2-4 <i>times</i> higher in the US than in most comparable developed nations, so that&#39;s a whole different problem all unto itself.)<br><br>I am sure Destin and his family are very responsible gun owners. But owning guns moves the risk of an accident from zero to non-zero.

There are 3 things that effect sound localisation (you missed one). These are interaural frequency difference (IFD), your head casts an acoustic &#39;shadow.&#39; Interaural time difference (ITD) your brain can detect the 0.0006 second delay between your ears from a sound that is 90 degrees to your head. And lastly interaural level differences (ILD). As you double your distance from a sound you lower it&#39;s level by 6dB. The average distance between your ears is 21.5cm therefore if a sound occurs 21.5cm away from your right ear at 90 degrees to your head then by the time it reaches your left ear it will have doubled its distance and your left ear will hear the sound 6dB quieter. Add in the IFD and ITD and you can easily localise sound. This goes out the window when a sound is equidistant from your ears i.e. It is in front or behind you. There is no time, frequency or level difference and we therefore rely upon the pinna. The fact that the pinna blocks sound from behind you makes front to back localisation relatively easy but vertical localisation is much harder. As you correctly explained it is done via the concha, helix and antihelix. The sound reflections off of these parts of the outer ear have roughly a 0.00002 second delay between them and your brain can distinguish these and use them to locate the sound. But, this is not particularly accurate leading to the struggle to locate sound in this plane. Our ability to localise sound to our sides is by far the strongest with IFD, ITD, ILD and the Pinna (in that order of effectiveness) all working together. Whereas vertical localisation is reliant solely on the pinna leading to the inaccuracy.", "comment_date": "2017-08-13T17:10:39Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Fast car enjoyer", "comment_text": "When destin Magically gets a deep southern accent", "comment_date": "2017-08-13T17:10:22Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "vesselfpv", "comment_text": "Psyco- acoustics", "comment_date": "2017-08-13T17:10:15Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "sgv6618", "comment_text": "Hey Destin cool video as always.

An additional aspect for head-tilting in dogs may be binocular.  Notice that dogs also look intently while tilting their heads.  Binocular vision gives visual clues about depth location, but only if the pattern of images from both eyes &#39;compute&#39; the differences because visual details about angular recognition can be distinguished from &#39;left&#39; to &#39;right&#39; between the eyes at their orientation.  This also can be demonstrated with an experiment.<br>Look at anything that would not look different from one eye to the other; for instance, look at a wire that&#39;s strung horizontally between power or telephone poles, but without the poles being within your visual field.  The image of the wire in each eye will be the same when your head is level, and you won&#39;t be able to distinguish its distance from you unless you tilt your head.  When you tilt your head, the angular difference between the images in your eyes gives the visual clues needed for depth perception.  Humans and dogs evolved as predators that needed to see &amp; distinguish prey &amp; other predators from a large distance while also needing to calculate that distance visually.  On the other hand, ambush predators like cats rely more on auditory range-finding because they get close to their prey before pouncing, so they don&#39;t rely on visual clues with head-tilting.", "comment_date": "2017-08-13T17:01:13Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Lammet", "comment_text": "Cringe", "comment_date": "2017-08-13T17:01:07Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Skinny Mcdoogin", "comment_text": "SmarterEvery*Month", "comment_date": "2017-08-13T17:01:06Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Alex Parris", "comment_text": "Sad... i cant use headphones at work as it provides too much hazard for getting caught on things and damaging plants and equipment :(", "comment_date": "2017-08-13T17:00:53Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Icantthinkofanameman", "comment_text": "The heart of the discerning acquires knowledge,<br>    for the ears of the wise seek it out", "comment_date": "2017-08-13T17:00:37Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Vinesh", "comment_text": "some responsible parenting here, ladies and gentlemen.

The timing differential from our two ears means that sound is picked up and interpreted by either ears at different time, creating a time lag. Each of the location neurons is a sort of &quot;AND gate&quot;, where the two sounds from both ears must be picked up at the exact same time for it to be triggered.

Some random thoughts:<br><br>- The spectral cues filter sounds before you reach your ears, modifying the spectrum, but if you don&#39;t know what the original spectrum of the sound was, how can you tell how it was modified in order to localise it? You can&#39;t! You need to have some familiarity with the sounds that you&#39;re hearing for this to work.<br><br>- In order to be able to hear the effect of the filter, the sounds need to have frequencies that the filtering effects, so it only works with broadband sounds. If you try playing a 1kHz sine wave from a speaker, you will find it hard to localize compared to noise.<br><br>- As well as the pinna, reflections from your shoulders give height information.<br><br>- It&#39;s interesting to think about where the spectral filtering comes from, as it shows the duality between time domain impulse responses and frequency responses of systems. As well as hearing sound that has travelled directly from the source to your ears, you also hear sound that has reflected off of things, like your pinna and shoulders. What you hear is the sum of the direct sound and all the reflections. Because sound takes time to travel, each of these reflections is delayed by some amount. Considering a sine wave, if you add it to itself with a delay equal to half the wavelength, the peaks line up with the troughs, and it cancels out, so you get a dip in the frequency response at that frequency. The amount that this happens changes with the frequency, so a single reflection creates a &quot;comb filter&quot;, with equally spaced frequencies that cancel out.", "comment_date": "2017-08-13T15:23:32Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "AbdullaH SalamI", "comment_text": "Hello im just curious, this coming eclipse what will happen if you point a lazer into the moon.

By seeing an unusual Shape compared to the relatively uniform pattern of the layout of the branches, I will focus my attention on that object. In this case it was enough to see the drone. Size confirms shape as to the object being out of place. Silhouette against contre jour or any global light is very important to note, as in foliage, the light normally passes through leaves, grass etc and it&#39;s only fully blocked by solid objects such as trunks, rocks and creatures. Sometimes the object is not directly visible, but it&#39;s Shadow may give away its location. Closely related to Shape is Structure. The difference being that rather than noticing that a shape is out of place which can be an automatic recognition, Structure evaluates the shape to determine its nature, whether natural or man made, friend or foe etc, etc. Hunters with so called &#39;eagle eyes&#39; have simply practiced the above until it&#39;s just second nature...<br><br>On their own, these things seem obvious, but it&#39;s amazing how much we look at and do not see.", "comment_date": "2017-08-13T15:07:36Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Prion", "comment_text": "So if I watched a video on the Sound Traveler channel would I be unable to properly detect vertical sounds since the microphones in your ears pick up sounds reflected off ears that are a different shape than mine?", "comment_date": "2017-08-13T15:07:23Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "GundamZeroSeven", "comment_text": "Good Shot", "comment_date": "2017-08-13T15:07:15Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Dream XCVIII", "comment_text": "I always think your videos are awesome and very informative and don&#39;t get me wrong I definitely learn something every time but when I finally learn whatever you&#39;re teaching I always think &quot;oh of course obviously&quot; but this was the first time where I was legit stumped lol I assumed when you asked the question at the beginning that it had something to do with the volume of the sound not that our brain is hardwired to the shape of our ear and that experiment was a cool way to show that, I don&#39;t think of myself as a god or anything but I do reserve my likes for videos I actually think deserve them and you have definitely earned it\ud83d\udc4d, keep up the awesome videos ", "comment_date": "2017-08-13T15:07:08Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "x519x Canada", "comment_text": "Dam the leaves fall early where ever you are I&#39;m in Canada and the leaves are still green", "comment_date": "2017-08-13T15:07:01Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Fourth Root", "comment_text": "Shooting a rifle into the air?
