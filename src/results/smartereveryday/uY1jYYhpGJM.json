Every single little movement in the ISS has to be compensated for, otherwise all it would take is somebody to walk too fast and bump into a wall to cause the entire ISS to be moved out of position.<br><br>I am also dying to understand the airlock systems. I noticed in this mockup those airlocks sometimes look like they might seal. And others look like they are have been blocked by the ceiling racks. And others don&#39;t even look like they are functional.<br>And in many rooms just doesn&#39;t see like there is anything at all. If you ever look at a submarine, the airlocks are frequent. In the ISS if you shut any airlock, everybody would be unable to get to through to vast portions of the ISS since it has a main corridor. Considering we are talking about Micrometeorites,  extreme temperature changes on a thin metal sheathing, and a zillion gadgets with plumbing in/out of this sheathing. I would expect getting air leaks is the #1 safety issue. If you are looking for a unique video to make, make one on how the airlock safety procedures work. how they expect to get to the other modules, And to operate those airlocks for us.", "comment_date": "2015-11-27T05:31:09Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Chaitanya Bankanhal", "comment_text": "It&#39;s Just awesome!", "comment_date": "2015-11-25T16:35:45Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "L33roy", "comment_text": "why does it matter which way up or down", "comment_date": "2015-11-25T03:34:32Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "R.
