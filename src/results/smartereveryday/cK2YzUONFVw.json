I lived in Sub Saharan Africa for two years MANY years ago now. I got malaria four times. I don&#39;t know which particular species of trypanosome I had because I never got tested. The prophylaxis drugs that we took was supposed to prevent the malarial parasite, which we WOULD get, from becoming full blown within us. Even if you didn&#39;t get the fever and chills and other symptoms, you still were infected with the parasite. Taking a heavy curative dose of drugs either orally or by injection would &quot;cure&quot; you and that is what I did. A few days of feeling very bad followed by a couple of days of being very weak... and you would be over it. Over the years, however, the trypanosomes have evolved and have become resistant to drugs that used to work well so we have found new ones. Which in turn will eventually become ineffective. Malaria is only going to be eradicated by a full on war against the parasite by various means. One of the best would be to genetically alter the vector (the mosquito) so that they are no longer suitable intermediate hosts for the parasite. Another way would be to release sterile males into the environment so that the population of mosquitoes could be reduced. This second method would, however, impact the local ecology because the mosquitoes themselves are part of an established food web. The problem with the whole malaria question in, however, that it is a problem in the developing world and not in developed countries so the money drive for profit to eradicate it is not there.

This makes sense because the infection rates of malaria occur mostly in Africa where mosquitos are most present, and the people who are stricken with Sickle Cell Disease (SCD) are largely of African and in some cases Arabian descent.  Now why is Sickle cell a response to malaria?  It lies in the shape of the cell.  Red blood cells are normally round and squishy, almost jello like.  This is so red blood cells can squeeze through capillaries and alveoli.  Sickle cell is essential a hard red blood cell in a crescent moon shape, hence &quot;sickle&quot;.  As stated by Mr. Sandlin, malaria uses the contents of red blood cells to reproduce and eventually burst the squishy cell.  Since SC is hard, malaria cannot burst the cell.  The downside to this is that SCs can block capillaries and alveoli, causing oxygen deprived parts of the body.  Thankfully, the lifespan of these cells is much much shorter than those of normal red blood cells to prevent this blockage problem so they are broken down by the body before damage can be done, but  SCD becomes a problem when a certain healthy red blood cell to SC ratio is reached.

One of them is called Shistosoma mansoni (or &quot;blood fluke&quot; is what google translater tells me). It is often found in standing freshwater and widespread in Africa. It&#39;s between host is a freshwater snail. If animals bath in this water, Shistosoma mansoni makes it&#39;s way directly through their skin. The symptoms of an infection are pretty similar to those of malaria, but often the infections show symptoms in a very late state of the sickness.  BUT these eggs appeared to be pretty huge. I&#39;ve never seen real Shistosoma egss, hence I dont know their size. Parasites usually reproduce themselves asexually in the between host and sexually in the final host, so i probably am wrong by assuming these are Shistosoma eggs.
