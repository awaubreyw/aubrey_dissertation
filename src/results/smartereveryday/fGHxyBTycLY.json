No matter what power a flash is set to, camera flashes always fire at the same luminosity, they adjust their apparent brightness by lengthening the flash duration. The flash duration of your Canon 580ex II is 1/1000th of a second at full power (1/1) and at 1/4 power it is 1/4000th, and so on. Four flashes firing at 1/4 power equal the &quot;brightness&quot; of one firing at full power, but the flash duration is shorter, potentially freezing the bullet. Technically you could be crazy and have 128 flashes firing at 1/128 power and have a 1/35,000th second flash duration, but then you might as well buy a dedicated high speed flash! You should do a high speed video about the nature of how camera flash works!
