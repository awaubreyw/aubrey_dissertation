This is a basic, broad and general thought with not much testing but, why are you attracted to light? Maybe not so much the bulb itself for you and i, but more so the <b>area</b> of light being lit up. You can see easier. Now, owels and bats may not be atttacted to light in the same way, since they can operate and function with night vision. And plants may not &quot;see&quot; necessarily, yet theres something they still recieve from it as a source and or tool. Seeing is important, whether it be visually or perspectively. How can we do anything and accomplish anything without the ability to <b>see</b> (even within the realm of understanding). Different animals have different methods for being able to see, to accomplish the very same task than any other animal does that may use a polar opposite method for seeing. Same tasks, different methods of seeing, yet all are <b>seeing</b> to accomplish their task one after the other.

This is how they track us beyond their attraction to carbon dioxide. This allows them to track us regardless of wind direction and at greater distances.  Once the mosquitoes have found you they also tend to bite where the skin is the thinnest thus reinforcing this theory as the most heat escapes us where our skin is the thinnest. I will also challenge you to look at your friends who seem to take the brunt of the mosquito attacks. I think you will find that, in general,  they are those friends with naturally thin skin.

This way, I would attract only the harmful bugs and kill them. The use of octenol is also a good idea, but once the molecules spread in the air, they wouldnt really attract the bugs into the zapper.<br>What do you think about such idea?

My dad noticed that the moths seemed to pass out after being around the light for too long. They would pile up on the ground, or table under the light, but they would be gone by morning. I watched and never saw anything eating the moths and never found moth parts that would suggest they had been eaten. It appeared to me that the moths were passing out and falling, then eventually regaining consciousness and flying away. Given their erratic and excited behavior, it seemed to me that they were being excited by the artificial light to the point that many of them would pass out. The stimulus didn&#39;t seem to continue after the moth passed out, because they would be gone in the morning, even if the light was left on all night. It reminded me of how humans can become excited during certain &quot;activities&quot; in a way that will sometimes culminate in a dramatic loss of strength, coordination and even spasming is completely unrelated parts of the body. Some people have even been known to feint. While I don&#39;t suggest that there is evidence to support any similarities in the type of stimulation, I believe that there may be some similar principles at play. I believe that the moth is excited by many kinds of artificial light in a way that humans may not be able to relate to directly. I believe that the moth is attracted to this type of stimulation and can be frenzied to a point of either exhaustion, or passing out from over stimulation. I would love for an entomologist to study this concept further and see if this might possibly be what is happening. It would also explain the unpredictable flight paths that are sometimes eratic and sometimes straight into the light source (frenzy, instead of a calculated misunderstanding of its surroundings. Do you still have any interest in moths and their relationship with these lights?

It\u2019s as if they are trying to get inside of the fluorescent tube but of course they can\u2019t. The bees will have their faces against the glass and flapping their wings as hard as they can driven by some instinct that tells them they have to get to the very core of the light source. Staring right into the lights and being so close like that they must be completely blinded. Once the bees have fixated on the lights they just keep going until they drop to the ground in exhaustion where they die. I have been stung more then once when they have dropped onto my clothes without me noticing and I accidentally bring my arm down on them or what ever.

You see, as you explain it, if the moth makes use of the moon as a tool of orientation, the space it travels through can be considered 2D. The moon is always up. In the case of a point source like a lamp, the space is 3D, meaning that the &quot;moon&quot; will sometimes be up, but can also be right, left, down relative to the moth. Therefore a moth would not take a 2D log path as you have shown, but that path would be twisted in 3D, as the photos show. In order to get better results, one should use a setup that puts the moon always above the moth (to simulate the 2D space).", "comment_date": "2017-05-29T08:27:30Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Uncle Verum", "comment_text": "If at first it doesn&#39;t work, beat it until it does!

When the sun is out, they are not drawn towards the extra lights we have out/on(not sure why anyone would have their lights on during the day). I feel that when they are placed in a cold environment it&#39;s natural instinct to go towards light because of the warmer temperatures it can provide. Say a bug is inside of your house during the summer time, you will have the AC on, and they can still be drawn to the light. The instinct may be to go towards the brightest object in their vision because it&#39;s natural instinct to think that the brightest object provides the most heat. <br><br>I&#39;m no scientist yet or someone who studies bugs!

Back in the days of incandescents, they used to sell yellow light bulbs that supposedly didn&#39;t attract as many bugs (though I don&#39;t know whether that was ever scientifically proven.) Bug zappers have black light bulbs supposedly because they do better at attracting bugs, which again seems to be unproven and somewhat questionable. Some people below are assuming that bugs are actually searching out a source of heat, which would be infrared range, not light that&#39;s visible to us at all. Other people actually build fires to try to keep bugs away.<br><br>I really doubt the lunar theory. Bugs really can&#39;t fly in the direction of the moon like they can a nearby source of light. Even if they are using the moon as a navigation aid, bugs meander; they don&#39;t fly determinedly in a single direction, thus they would never get caught in a logarithmic spiral in an attempt to fly straight since straight flight is definitely not a bug behavior.<br><br>Bugs might be attracted to light because they are wanting to rendezvous with potential mates for reproduction, or they are wanting to hunt for food near the light. However, I don&#39;t see any mating or hunting behavior taking place near light sources so I think we can rule those ideas out.<br><br>Another possibility is that bugs are programmed to fly toward the light when seeking to escape from an enclosure. It makes sense that bugs should have an instinct that would allow them to find their way out of caves. It would also explain why bugs seem to be lost, disoriented, fascinated, and trapped by light sources and refuse to fly away.
