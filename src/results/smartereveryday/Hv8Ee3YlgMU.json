Very informative. \nFor completeness, Van Der Waal&#39;s force is not a vacuum force. The easiest way to think about it is the molecules in a fluid acting like magnets. Water is a permanent dipole and behaves this way naturally. Some molecules can form temporary polarization (induced dipole) when the charge of nearby molecules force electrons (or charged atoms in some cases) to the far side.", "comment_date": "2012-02-19T08:33:31Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "RedwoodGeorge", "comment_text": "@Protectorr13 No real pain to speak of - they use numbing drops before the procedure.
