He was an Aristotelian philosopher and did promote it, but by the time he was alive it had been a standard of science for 600 years.  I think it is an amalgam of Francis Bacon, 16th century philosopher, with Roger Bacon, 13th century scholar and monk who read the works of Alhazen (10th century Arab mathematician and scientist) and who spread widely the anti-Aristotelian notion that we cannot trust our intuition to arrive at correct observation, instead laying out the basics (hypothesis-experiment-control-result) that would later be picked up by Descartes and Pascal in the early 17th century to arrive at the scientific method we know today. Francis Bacon spent half his life as a barrister and, while he promoted the scientific method, neither invented it nor defined it in any way. He would have read about it in Alhazen&#39;s works on optics, and sung its praises to his readers, but in the field of philosophy and science, it was already old news by his time. I know there are many sources across the internet that describe him as the &quot;father of the scientific method&quot; but I think it is important to note that all those sources are American or British, while sources in other languages all point to Alhazen instead. It is a pity that what can be described as anglo-centrism leads to wiping away important aspects of our heritage, including the Arabs who made decisive contributions to mathematics and science, including giving us algebra and the number system we use today, and the Indians, who literally taught the western world including Romans and Greeks how to write, made ceramic, and make steel.", "comment_date": "2020-11-16T23:48:28Z", "likes_count": 3}, {"comment_by": "Daytruin ziaos", "comment_text": "hopefully she got to do the experiment.", "comment_date": "2020-11-16T23:23:54Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Robert Smith", "comment_text": "Some fool playing with his lethal toys covering the ground with glass dust for other creatures to ingest.", "comment_date": "2020-11-16T19:42:12Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "crzy11000", "comment_text": "AT <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k5MORochIDw&amp;t=1m20s\">1:20</a> it looks like the drop actually shatters at a faster rate than the bullet is flying.", "comment_date": "2020-11-16T17:02:23Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "MasterAlucardGV", "comment_text": "not sure if breaking glass in the open is good for the environment", "comment_date": "2020-11-16T15:53:36Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Philip Brooks", "comment_text": "<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k5MORochIDw&amp;t=5m18s\">5:18</a> what happened here?

You can see the light travel through the glass, proving that it is not a single pulse of light so the initial source is not from the bullet&#39;s impact. Rather, it&#39;s possible that as energy courses through the tail of the drop and electrons are pulled towards highly electronegative oxygen atoms, light is released as electrons fall to a low-energy state and emit photons.<br><br>In order for Si to form 4 bonds, one of its 3s electrons must be excited and go into a higher-energy 3p orbital. Si then forms bonds with oxygen. As energy ripples through the glass, electrons are attracted towards oxygen nuclei and end up in a more stable 2p orbital. This releases light. This leaves Si cations and O anions. Si ions would react with free oxygen in the air and get reduced while oxygen anions get oxidized and possibly break off of the crystal to form oxygen gas in a higher-energy state than it began as. Essentially, the bullet&#39;s energy could be converted to electrical potential and light and oxygen gas.<br><br>But that&#39;s just a slightly educated guess which is likely riddled with flaws \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2642\ufe0f", "comment_date": "2019-12-24T06:26:15Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Ajay Mathew John", "comment_text": "Hi Destin, Would you answer me a small doubt, at 4 min 28 seconds the AK round broke apart into pieces.

I was listening to Neil DeGrasse Tyson explain a theory about how scientists had questioned the &quot;cosmic shooting gallery&quot; hypothesis of the early solar system citing the lack of evidence of glancing blows from comet strikes on the moon. All craters on the surface of the moon were perfectly circular in shape and therefore it must be from volcanic activity rather than comet strikes. This led the scientist to the realization and discovery of the fact that when an object collides with another,  such as when a comet collides with a planetary body, if the comets terminal velocity reaches a point to where the total impact will be stronger than the forces that hold the molecular bonds together, the result will be an explosion rather than a &quot;simple&quot; impact. Obviously I&#39;m no NDT, but thats basically what he said.  He gave the example of the meteor crater in Arizona having no meteorite material in the bottom of it when miners searched it; when that comet/asteroid/meteoroid hit the surface of the earth it simply vaporized instantly because the resulting forces ripped apart both the comet and the surrounding landscape down to a molecular level. I bring this up because in the one shot where you say &quot;I don;t know what just happened&quot; it seems as though you hit the drop dead on with a high velocity round. Could it be that there was enough energy transfer to create the type of impact mentioned above? Idk and I don&#39;t pretend to know but that&#39;s what came to mind when I watched it.

I would like to politely disagree with the theory that the first A/R bullet (and probably the second but you can&#39;t see it) breaks the PRD.  The PRD stayed intact long enough to explode the A/R bullet. ( blew my mind!) While I&#39;m not sure how to explain this, I believe what happened was the PRD stayed intact from the bullet hit, but the sudden movement compromised the weaker tail. Picture the crack of a whip. The sudden movement of the heavier, and stronger, part of the drop whipped the tail, which is less strong, causing the tail to go, initiating the implosion of the PRD. I don&#39;t know how to explain mechanics of it but I think the sudden inertia imparted on the large end while the tail end trying to stay in place triggered the demise of the drop. See theory that, Objects in motion stay in motion while objects at rest, want to stay at rest.  I&#39;m sure you know what I&#39;m trying to say, I just don&#39;t have the knowledge to explain it as eloquently as you can. I am interested in your thoughts on my theory if you wouldn&#39;t mind responding to me. Thanks!!! <br>P.S. Where can I obtain my own PRD&#39;s?  I had small ones from a magic supply store but used them up in my shows. I am completely jealous of the extremely large ones you were able to procure!!

We live in southern Mexico and our parents are homeschooling us. Marcos is 13 and Annalee is 11. We have thoroughly enjoyed watching your series on the Prince Rupert&#39;s drops and their reaction to having bullets fired at them. The slow-motion shots are really cool!<br><br>Here are some paragraphs that we wrote with our dad, Tim, about some of our observations and predictions about the Prince Rupert&#39;s drop. <br><br>The Prince Rupert&#39;s drop is made by dropping molten glass into a container of water. In the process of cooling, the outside cools rapidly because of its immediate contact with the water but the inside cools more slowly. As the drop cools, this causes a tension differential the deeper you go into the drop. We read on the Internet that the outer 10% of the drop is where the greatest tension, and therefore strength,  is located.<br><br>We watched some other videos that investigated the speed at which glass shatters. We found that regular glass and tempered glass shatter at about 1600 meters per second. In your video you showed calculations of the Rupert&#39;s drop shattering at about the same speed. Since the Rupert&#39;s drop was so much harder than regular or tempered glass, we predicted that it would shatter much faster, but it doesn&#39;t. We were surprised to find that the increased tension does not increase the speed at which the glass shatters.<br><br>We are wondering if it would take eight times the pressure to shatter a 1 inch diameter Prince Rupert&#39;s drop than it would to shatter a 1/2 inch diameter Prince Rupert&#39;s drop since there is an approximately eight fold decrease in volume.<br><br>On the Internet, we tried to find the pressure required to crush a Prince Rupert&#39;s drop. We found a variety of answers, anywhere from 10 tons to 100,000 psi. <br><br>Do you think that the pressure will be different if the volume of the drop is different?<br><br>We are, like you, trying to get Smarter Every Day!<br><br>Marcos and Annalee", "comment_date": "2017-10-03T20:39:11Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Noor", "comment_text": "&amp; u use a china made AK47 round.

I get your eye mixes the activity of the three to create other colors, like violet, but how yellow? yellow is a primary color, and you cannot mix two colors to make a primary color, just like you cannot mix two substances to make an element.(alchemy, for that reason, is nonsensical) so how? also, I highly recommend the channel Vsauce. you will not believe ow wonderful it is, I&#39;m telling you, you have to check it out. my favorites are the brachistochrone curve and the Banach-Tarski paradox. its spectacular, but his channel is not as hands-on as yours is, and that&#39;s why I enjoy yours so much. thank you for taking the time to read this, and amazing job desolating that prince Rupert&#39;s drop!", "comment_date": "2017-05-24T20:40:38Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "t 2", "comment_text": "Does eye color change the humans natural night vision, color perception, or color blind average percentage.

Would a solid brass pointed .50 Beowulf work despite having a relatively slow speed?  Would the .22WMR have worked if the bullet had been made of something harder than lead or copper plated lead?

If not, why? Please provide the scientific rationale behind the process. My kids and I have talked about this while watching a movie and enjoying our favourite snack and we would really like to know the answer. I would think that you should be able to squeeze it to less than the original volume given enough pressure as I assume that it is the moisture inside the kernels that turns to steam when popping thus releasing said steam and reducing the total volume.

If you look at the exact moment of impact, before triboluminescense occurs, there is an orange flash of light. However, said orange flash wasn&#39;t there with the AK round, but if you look at the angle at which the bullet hit it seems to glance-off more than the other two. Now, the strength of a Prince Rupert&#39;s drop comes from it&#39;s insane internal pressure and gives it equally insane surface tension strength, but imagine what would happen if something melts the glass, even if it&#39;s only by a tiny amount? I think that&#39;s what is happening here; the bullet hits the drop with such force that the resulting friction heats the glass up just enough to allow the surface to melt, breaking the surface tension and therefore the drop. I have an idea on how you could possibly test this too: incendiary rounds, specifically from the smaller caliber guns. If it really is just brute force overcoming the surface tension, the smaller caliber guns in your last video shouldn&#39;t be able to break the drops even with the added energy from the incendiary charge (I&#39;m suggesting using smaller bullet that imparts much less energy, that way the variable of bullet power being the reason for them breaking wouldn&#39;t be as much of a factor). However, if I&#39;m right and it&#39;s more to do with the heat from friction, then maybe a drop made from Pyrex (if it can be created in the same way sodalime glass is and still form the same molecular structure) or another type of glass with a higher melting point would be even stronger.", "comment_date": "2017-04-30T23:11:06Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Delta", "comment_text": "How much time (read: fun) did you spend smashing life savers?", "comment_date": "2017-04-30T23:10:43Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Trey", "comment_text": "What Shell in the Pit song starts at <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k5MORochIDw&amp;t=1m03s\">1:03</a>?", "comment_date": "2017-04-30T23:10:09Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "zachary wasup", "comment_text": "Sdspeed beets armed", "comment_date": "2017-04-30T23:10:06Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Sato", "comment_text": "What if someone made a bullet out of a prince rupert&#39;s drop?", "comment_date": "2017-04-30T23:09:35Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Some guy", "comment_text": "is it only me that was skeptical to the candy sparks thing??? that&#39;s too nuts to be true", "comment_date": "2017-04-30T23:09:06Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "ygyguii", "comment_text": "Am I the only one disappointed he didn&#39;t use the really big gun?", "comment_date": "2017-04-30T23:08:47Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "William lee", "comment_text": "I wonder if you can start a fire with hard candy.", "comment_date": "2017-04-30T23:08:12Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Emmanuel Balascak", "comment_text": "Awesome video \ud83e\udd18\ud83c\udffb, but question what would happen if you shortened the prince Rupert straw tail.
