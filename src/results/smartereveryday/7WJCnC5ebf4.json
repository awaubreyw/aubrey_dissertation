Of course the wisdom and supernatrual intelligence of the designer of the jellyfish sting FAR outweighs that of the human designer of the hypodermic needle..but no one would ever agree that a hypodermic needle just appeared out of no where, so why do you think the similar and EVEN MORE complex jellyfish sting just..&quot; evolved&quot; ? Follow my logic: if a less complex thing with a similar mechanism ( hypodermic needle) MUST have had an intelligent designer....then a MORE complex but similar mechanism( jellyfish stinger) DEMANDS an even MORE superior and intelligent designer! We know that a man made the needle..but no man made the jellyfish stinger..so who made the jellyfish stinger?

And why does it seem stereo typical to talk about religion the more science can explain the universe?  It&#39;s almost as if religious folk are scared to learn the truth over their limited perspective that believing in the unknown will grant you access to a better after life. Here&#39;s the kicker though, just through the written word of God how can you put faith in what has been tainted by man? All we have is our history and man&#39;s tainted word as to what God/Jesus. We already know 9/11 didn&#39;t really happen the way our government says it did, so why should we be convinced that any published in written form is any less tainted? Especially religious text. Choose for yourselves.  Don&#39;t mindlessly follow something you don&#39;t truly understand", "comment_date": "2014-08-19T13:30:25Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "numbersnletters", "comment_text": "What&#39;s with the random bible quote thingy at the end", "comment_date": "2014-08-19T13:27:55Z", "likes_count": 10}, {"comment_by": "Nicodemus Diablo", "comment_text": "Very very cool.", "comment_date": "2014-08-19T13:27:33Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Lindsay Caldwell", "comment_text": "This is neat", "comment_date": "2014-08-19T13:24:52Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Jake E.", "comment_text": "I come here to watch a slow-motion jellyfish.

For our next test, The Reptimosis Jellyfish was placed on the areola(nipple region) of a Male Atheist Redditor like myself and the results were stunning, not only did the Reptimosis not sting, but it began to show emotions which were later identified as &quot;Mating Reflexes&quot;.
