You, and perhaps Captain Disillusion, are the only reason a person need to send money to their ISP every month for internet access.  Not only are your videos educational and entertaining, but you have the most charismatic personality of anyone on YouTube.  You, and your entire family, are just so great that I often dream that you are my neighbors, coming over for barbecues on occasion, and engaging in great conversation.  You really show that you love everything about what you do and just about everything in life fascinates you.  I find it hard to believe that you haven&#39;t been offered a weekly series on PBS or The Science Channel.  If it happens, I expect that it would be as successful as Myth Busters was.  Okay, Adam Savage also has that &quot;thing&quot; that you have so I&#39;ll add him to the list.  As an Emmy Award Winning documentary filmmaker, I have to say that your videos are among some of the most well produced videos on YouTube.  A huge thanks to those on your team who help you do such wonderful work.  I&#39;ve had some amazing experiences during my 40+ years in the business, but I often find myself envying you.  I hang on every moment of every one of your videos.  Instead of having to explain how things work, to my friends, I usually just point them to your channel; saves me a lot of time.  Anyway, this is just my way of saying thank you for doing what you do, and being you.

As it makes this fall forward, the water is pushed out of the way and splashes as it travels up the front of the bowl and hits the underside of the rim.
