Both SpaceX and Orbital were not good. It looks like at the time SpaceX was about 4-5% failure rate. Orbital, according to your chart, is a wopping 20% failure rate (ouch!). SpaceX&#39;s rate has gotten worse with the September 2016 pad explosion: 2 failures in 29 launches, a failure rate of greater that 6%. These failure rates are unacceptable for unmanned launches, and would NEVER be contemplated for manned missions. SpaceX&#39;s released information about the September 2016 event raises more questions. The reason for the failure was given as an ignition in the helium tank within the LOX tank.The cause was the use of deep cryo (super cold) lox and the compsite wrapping in the helium tank. If the cause stated is in fact the source of the failure, it is troubling that the SpaceX design process permitted this design to become baseline. Their success rate so far is way worse than Atlas V, Delta, Proton &amp; Soyuz. The risky choice of deep cryo LOX is also worrying. This concept has been known for 50 years or so, but never used. Do you think there is a reason for that? All of this suggests deeper problems at SpaceX. What are their processes? Are the following them? Is there verification of this? Are they following systems engineering best practices?", "comment_date": "2017-01-17T09:19:37Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "integerrandom", "comment_text": "It&#39;s not really complicated guys, it&#39;s not a rocket science... oh, wait.. it is", "comment_date": "2017-01-16T04:20:19Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Jonathan Brown", "comment_text": "my wifi cut out as soon as he started to talk about wifi", "comment_date": "2017-01-16T02:34:06Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Ben Hiccup", "comment_text": "You Got Us!    <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbabP9ttrZc&amp;t=3m33s\">3:33</a> - <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbabP9ttrZc&amp;t=3m37s\">3:37</a> ...

The very design of the semi-automatic pistol requires that the expanding gases from the shell push back the slide in order to cycle the next round, since that&#39;s the path of least resistance. With this setup, I predict it&#39;d have to push the body of the gun, as well as the magazine, forward in the same direction of the bullet, which would be weird.<br>I&#39;m wondering if the gun would fire and cycle normally with recoil in a different direction, if the gun would simply jam since it wasn&#39;t designed for the gun to move the whole body of the gun, or if the gun would mis-fire catastrophically (which I feel would be least likely)<br><br>Hope it&#39;s at least an interesting thought.

I can not figure out why they recover the stage by landing with rockets. Surly this makes things fare more complex and heavy than they need to be.<br>\u00a0\u00a0 First they have to carry the fuel needed for landing aloft which means they have less payload capacity. Wouldn&#39;t a parachute be much lighter? Second they have to carry the computers and the programs to make the landing possible. In addition they need to carry the landing gear aloft adding even more weight. You are also adding a lot more equipment which adds more weight and complexity.<br>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Finally I don&#39;t understand why they even want to recover the first stage. I think the shuttle program showed clearly that reuseability is not as clear cut a money saver as one would think.<br>\u00a0\u00a0 Finally why even develop an entirely new rocket system from scratch? We have rockets that have been in use for 50+ years. That is 50 years worth of bugs worked out of the system.<br>\u00a0\u00a0 I hope you can make a video addressing these subjects because I am confused.

So what CAN catastrophically kill the upper structure during nominal boost? I rule out an auto destruct misfire and am left with only three candidates, all of which are basically mechanical failure of the superstructure or of an upper stage cryogenic tank. One is dynamic misalignment of the stack by too large sideways course correction, think Challenger pushing through jet stream. Two is MaxQ failure, when the product of increasing airspeed and reducing air pressure maxes out to max dynamic stress. Three is pogo. Pogo haunted Saturn early on. All fluid rocket boosters are vulnerable to it. Pogo is a vertical tremor resonating that is self reinforcing by increasing fuel pressure, hence fuel and oxidizer flow and hence combustion, rocket engine output and hence rocket acceleration, closing the feedback loop.

That it was a burgeoning rocket program with a private company that was helping to lower the costs of payload to orbit. That you do indeed learn more from failures than successes and it&#39;s better to have them now rather than later when the stakes may be higher. It also helps to shake off complacency in engineers and flight controllers that became lethal with the Challenger and Columbia shuttles and reminds the public that as seemingly routine as space travel has become (at least to LEO), there are always risks.
