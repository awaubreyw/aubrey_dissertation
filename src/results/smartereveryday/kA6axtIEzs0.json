I just have a quick question for you. How would you create a light painting photograph with a subject in it, and keep that subject tact sharp without any blur? Is it possible? I know your shots show subjects in it but I don&#39;t want any blur from my subject. The only thing that makes sense to me is 1 of 2 ways: 1) Photoshop 2 separate exposure and make a composite. Although I feel that this may look fake. 2) use a ttl chord, (10m or longer) put the camera on 2nd curtain, paint the shot and the flash will freezing any blur.
