So the formula looks like this \u2014\u203a (vb - va / ua - ub). So Final velocity of the wood block (7.12meters/second) minus the final velocity of the steel ball (.36m/s) divided by the initial velocity of the steel ball (33m/s) minus the initial velocity of the wood block (0m/s). Therefore CoR= (7.12m/s - .36m/s)/(33m/s - 0m/s) = (6.76m/s)/(33m/s) = .204848..... Due to the numbers we used for our calculations (e.g. the .36m/s), we are limited to only 2 significant figures. So we are left with .20 as our CoR.
