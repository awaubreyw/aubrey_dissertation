Could launching a rocket towards the sun push us futher away from the sun in our orbital path .

They traded blow for blow, strike after strike . Slowly Sharp was getting worn down by Razor&#39;s sheer raw power, if it kept going like this he wouldn&#39;t last much longer. In the second round, Sharp went on the offensive throwing caution to the wind and going in for the kill. But a momentary lapse of judgment gave Razor the perfect opportunity... a deadly strike on a vital point. Sharp went down... his entire body was in agony. Was this it, after everything he&#39;s been through, all his brothers and friends he cut through to get to this stage .... was this the end. He wobbled, a smile drew across Razors face. Like an experienced hunter he sensed that the end was near for his prey. There was a moment of silence. Razor charged, blow after blow, Sharp was using all of his strength just to keep everything together. HIs consciousness begin to fade. Was this the end... No.... no.. NEVER. He dove towards Razor, madness in his eyes, and with everything that was left in his feeble broken body Sharp screamed swinging his fists in desperation. The hunter has suddenly become the prey, Razor hesitated, but that split second was all the Sharp needed. BANG. The crowd went silent ... Razor&#39;s broken body lay across the canvas. He was dead. <br><br>Four omnipotent giants appeared from the shadows. &quot;ARE YOU HAPPY NOW, IS THIS WHAT YOU WANTED!&quot; Sharp roared as his limp body slumped to the ground. But he knew they did not speak his language, nor he theirs. They simply appeared one day and forced his people to slaughter each other for their entertainment.

You always make the coolest videos. \r<br>Now for me to get really nerdy. You have a couple problems with your design. \r<br>The first problem is you are assuming if one line breaks from another line then it would also be broken sooner from other lines. But the interaction of the lines when they hit each other is probably more like Rock-Paper-Scissors than like box car races. \r<br>Second problem is that you are using a surrogate measure. I\u2019m assuming your ultimate question is; \u201cWhich line will whack the most weeds in a season and will need the least amount of replacement?\u201d (unless, of course, your ultimate question is to see what video you can get the most views on\u2026 in which case you succeeded, and I would ask that you keep it up because I seriously love the videos). \r<br>If your goal is to find out which line works, the best then you would actually want to do a different study. This is analogous to the surrogate measures of blood pressure measurements with antihypertensives compared to the patient-oriented outcomes of myocardial infarction and stroke. Patients don\u2019t really care what the blood pressure number is\u2026 they care if they are going to have a stroke or not. \r<br>Similarly, we don\u2019t care if one line breaks the other, we care if we will need to buy and replace more weed whacker line or not. \r<br>So a better design might be using one line for a month and measuring how much you go through. Then another line for a month and measure how much you go through, etc. \r<br>And an even better design would be to get lawn care companies to use different weed whacker line over a period of time and blind them to what they\u2019re using. Then measure how much they went through AND give them a questionnaire to fill out regarding ease of use and efficacy/efficiency of the line. At the end of the study, you can weigh the pros and cons of consumption of line vs efficiency of the cut and ease of use. Tough to do that study though\u2026\r<br>And an even more interesting comparison would be which line works best on which weed whacker \u2013 some are faster than others, some give out more line than others, some have a different angle of attack (bend in the pole) than others\u2026 and some people are of different heights (making the angle different). I\u2019d bet the average homeowner doing their own lawn care will use line at a different rate than the a lawn care company\u2026 but we would need another study for that. \r<br>I told you I was going to get nerdy.", "comment_date": "2021-05-01T15:04:01Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Maciej Krzywkowski", "comment_text": "Hi.<br>I&#39;m a fan of your channel.

Whichever one becomes taunt first has a tendency to cross its plastic threshold, and causes the break. Like over hardened metal. While the one that typically gets tangled on has a bit of slack between line and spool, allowing a little bit of an edge to absorb some forces. Another thing, is the Facets of some of the lines, I think has a tendency to add failure points. If you ever do a 4th video, it&#39;d be cool to make custom heads that you only clamp 5 inches of line to. No spools. Test a faceted group of line, then a cylindrical group. Battle the two winners there. Also you can do educational content, or BTS videos on why these facets matter, or dont etc.. and you can recall your plastic, elastic strength video from a little while back, and show how it all ties together into everyday thinking.

It isn&#39;t as straight-cut (pun intended) as the winner actually being best, as any of those that lost without battling the winner, is likely better than the winner. In addition to that, if it is single-elimination you also have entries losing on poor luck, and in reality each matchup should have a statistically significant amount of fights.<br>Ideally, you should avoid brackets entirely, as each entry needs to fight all the other entries. This is however unfeasible in reality, as the time-complexity is approx O(n^2), which is why ie. chess tournaments uses a few fights, and a sort of scoring system as a heuristic instead. But it is also rather shoddy, a better way would be to find the winner from a regular tournament, then have it fight <b>all</b> other entries (because the only entry who really matters, is 1st-place). Any that it loses against, is then also required to recursively fight all other entries - making the worst-case time-complexity still the same, but likely to be lower in reality (especially when you remove or dont add entries that has no chance of becoming the winner despite winning over a winner-candidate, from/to the set of winner-candidates). This is because any top-ranker is likely a top-ranker for a reason, so the worthless entries should be failing their fights against any other top-ranker.<br><br>However, if worst-case is deemed important, then you could at least count degrees of separation (if A fought B, that is 0 degrees. If A hasn&#39;t fought C, and B fought C then A has 1 degree of separation to C. And so on), and force the winner (and those winning over winner) to fight entries which are n degrees separated.<br>If you care for more than merely identifying 1st-place, you will also want to have losers fight each-other in losers-brackets.<br><br>And this wall-of-text is why tournament arcs in anime are bad! :D", "comment_date": "2021-04-30T11:40:44Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "willypete125", "comment_text": "Dude I really want to hang out with this group of guys \ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23", "comment_date": "2021-04-30T11:39:18Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Raiyu", "comment_text": "Today we the council of dads is gathered for a tournament for the title of the big dad of the neighborhood", "comment_date": "2021-04-30T11:37:59Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Maicol Piani", "comment_text": "Anything can be studied.<br><br>Anything can be learnt.<br><br>Thanks for teaching this to us, Destin.", "comment_date": "2021-04-30T11:37:25Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "A persun that has a ridiculously long profile name", "comment_text": "mmmmmm pustegi junction :p", "comment_date": "2021-04-30T11:36:33Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "unde\u0192ined", "comment_text": "I can&#39;t believe I just watched 18 min of weed eaters.

It turns out that the left weed eater wins significantly more often. I guess it might be due to the experimental set-up. The weed eaters are arranged slightly inclined to each other. The right weed eater must rotate upwards while the left one rotates downwards. I wonder if gravity plays a role in this. Escecially since the masses of these cords are very small.

The higher density ones - that has the core, and therefore also have the rigidity - perform better because they have more motion energy; they pack a heavier punch. But also the shape, I believe, the less &quot;flimsy&quot; the shape is, the better it is to deflect incoming blows and to cut. The triangle one is too flimsy, it&#39;s more like a folded flat in some ways, too susceptible to incoming blows and cant handle the stress, but round ones are better at absorbing the blows because it can take the punch from any angle and hold up equally good - a blow from the wrong angle tears the weirder shapes faster.<br><br>The reason, I believe, the round core and sharp square got to the point they did, was because of those factors. The round core held up great, and technically tore off small pieces first, from what I could see, however, the sharp square cut off larger, and that I believe is due to its shape. While still pretty compact - and not having that many angles that could be torn worse than other angles, such as  the triangle - it also had something the round core didnt; it had the small edges. It wasnt like a very fine edge that could easily chip, like a katana (sorry for the nerdy comparison), but more like a non-honed ax. While not <b>very</b> sharp, it was still something that the round core didnt have. The edges, albeit blunt, on the sharp square cut into the outer layer of the round core and weakened it by cutting into the plastic, meaning in the end it was just the core holding up. And the core couldnt handle the centrifugal forces that occured when the two strips met and clashed, it needed the plastic &quot;shell&quot; to do that. It&#39;s like rebar inforced concrete, the core/rebar and the shell/concrete handles different kinds of stresses, and if one breaks, the other cant compensate for it, atleast not easily.<br><br><br>The sharp square had that going for it; while still being fairly compact - with no flimsy weird shapes that could get struck at &quot;the wrong angle&quot; and break easily - it had about the same density/weight as the round core, but with it&#39;s blunt edges it could do more cutting into the shell of the round core and weaken the round cores adaptability between rebar/concrete, thus in the end break it in larger chunks.<br><br>That&#39;s what I believe, anyway.", "comment_date": "2021-04-30T05:23:52Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Work Out", "comment_text": "In the future when robots take over the world, they&#39;ll remember you making them fight each other and do the same with us", "comment_date": "2021-04-30T05:23:31Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Daniel Cebulla", "comment_text": "I still don&#39;t know, which line won, I was focusing on the yelled parts \ud83d\ude01\ud83d\ude05<br>(and the pure joy behind that \u2764\ufe0f )", "comment_date": "2021-04-30T05:23:25Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Luke S", "comment_text": "Missed opportunity, could\u2019ve called this the \u201c Whack-Off\u201d", "comment_date": "2021-04-30T05:23:16Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Kristiyan Simov", "comment_text": "A bunch of dads having too much fun in the garage.", "comment_date": "2021-04-30T05:23:10Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Matt", "comment_text": "This is more intense than wwe", "comment_date": "2021-04-30T05:22:49Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "eric deherrera", "comment_text": "Not a sports fan at all, but this is the greatest thing I&#39;ve seen in a long, long while!!

The desired outcome is in the name if you think about dropping the tearing. Having a round leading edge would resist bending more like with a hollow tube harder to bend than a solid one. Having a smaller/flatter/nonexistent backside would make it more flexible since its in tension like how you can bend a ruler pretty easy and it bounce back. It sort of starts to take the shape of a tape ruler.

It\u2019s all about economics on these things and the more line you save the more money in your pocket. The downfall of the stiffened core lines is that they do not achieve a cleaner cut that is expected when maintaining properties as a professional. They are used in brush cutting applications. I also noticed that when the crossfire line broke, it was a tear at the base of the head. That was more of a head problem than a line problem. There are many different professional products that combat line tear at base like the echo speed feed 400 heads.
