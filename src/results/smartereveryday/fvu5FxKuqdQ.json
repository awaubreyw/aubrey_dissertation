There\u2019s a bunch of shortcomings mentioned in the video that are intrinsic to the problem. They can be reduced a bit with clever control systems solutions, but they can\u2019t go away. Fact remains that you\u2019re going to move forward with your body on what you think is a static floor (in the VR world), and the real floor is going to be slipping away from you. The current implementation has an additional time delay issue, but even if that went away the problem is still there. Your sense of inertia based on the floor you see in VR is going to be misaligned with the inertia you feel in the real world. The only way I can think of to reduce the scale of the problem is to have a huge treadmill, with a huge boundary ring.

That moment is what I mean. This will get weird. So in anime, cartoons, and games the characters lean in the direction they are going. Two point harness that suspends the character where they are lightly touching the deck. Then move the sensor on your back to just under your armpit level. To move in a direction you would need a &quot;short&quot; period to learn to lean into your movements. My thought is that trying that may help with the lag of your &quot;going somewhere&quot; and the treadmill reacting. Also with the ability lean to control moving the treadmill, we can make the treadmill stop on a dime if brakes were able to be incorporated into the treadmill. Our brains are able to, I&#39;m going sound like I&#39;m trying to sound smarter than I am, compute and calculate so much more than the average person realizes. My hope/assumption is that the natural power of the brain can be used to not have to program and code as much. To customize the treadmill speed, when you set up a profile, have the person move as fast as they can while leaning as far as they can in a bunch of directions. That and the lead foot&#39;s initial acceleration into that movement&#39;s direction could be used to set the treadmill&#39;s speed when reacting to input.<br>Side note: I don&#39;t mean to come off as I have it all figured out or it&#39;s this simple. I just wanted to get my thoughts down and see if people, that have experience in this area, think that any of this is useful.<br>Ok back to it. Then a program would have to be made to allow for an adjustable/gradual tread speed graph to represent the distance from centered and stationary to full speed and leaning in that direction. That way you can get a rough starting point (default speed for you) to customize to fit you and how active you feel that day. Make it where a walking speed for you is jogging for your avatar if you want.<br><br>I really liked this video and it&#39;s topic. I&#39;m geeking out to the best of my capacity to and I know I am lacking in knowledge of this.

In order to run in place/move... we need an OMNI direction treadmill...<br><br>I looked at the engineering of that omnin treadmill in the video. Quite cool setup... It goes one direction and the treads are basically smaller going the other direction. It seems like diagonal could be a problem...<br><br>Rather than looking at intent... many more sensors could solve the problem easier, by reading body langauge of the person. Naturally we often can tell what a humans intent is by body posturing and position. Muscle flex... to muscle release. Meaning the game coudl react nearly instnatly to a muscle flex and read muscle release...<br><br>Other types of sensors is contact.. etc... Obviously.. hooking a person in a stringed up suit adn having them run on thin air would make more sense.. Then have feed back shoes, but you would never feel terra firma...<br><br>Other omni directional systems I have seen are large spheres... that people run on that acna go fluidly any direction and have friction, and mass... a centralized rign and tether point would help. the reason its a large sphere is so that you feel less curve...<br><br>However what shae could one make... There is infalted options of materials morphing to be flat while underneath its moving... but that woudl change the entire thing... could use the same sphere design... that has internal compenents that retract and come up depending where it is so it is flat and then goes back down as it spends. So its a sphere but the sphere has little mechancial mechanisms  that make the top feel as if it is flat... they instnatly go up and down when nearing and edge so you don&#39;t bash into the surface.. I think that would be the best way, then yo ucna also mimic.. ground texture height... Not a log or anything in the way, but mimic a up, down, side slope... that owuld be currently the best thign capapble of being made.. Omni directional morphing sphere... OR an ODMS <br> As for intent... I think the mass of the sphere itself would feel like earth, since your PUSHING against it to accelerate it rather tha nthe later... and a friction analyzer could be put into the texture type, IE ICe dirt, earth.... Probably cost 280k to proto type this type of sphere... but upwards of 12-13 million to fine tune iterations of it... Then market value of 400-500 per unit... once everythign is figured out... but then how many would get or use it...

When walking, one&#39;s weight is shifted around on their feet and this weight shift, as well as the literal positions of the feet, can give a good indication of the persons intentions even if its not 100% perfect. <br><br>Additionally, it may improve the accuracy you can get from the treadmill movements if instead of using the center of the body as a reference point they used the feet of the person. This will likely have nearly the same result however you may be able to reduce the time between someone moving and the counter-movement of the treadmills. A potential issue of this is that if an adjustment in the treadmills is made while the person is in midstep, as would likely result from using the feet as reference points, the person may be thrown off balance due to the sudden shift in acceleration. A workaround for this is to make the acceleration much slower at first and then slowly increase it, this way no sudden jolt from the treadmills will throw someone off balance while they are using it but you would still get the benefit of a reduced time from the persons movement and the countermovement of the belt.", "comment_date": "2020-09-22T07:19:54Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "That one guy", "comment_text": "<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fvu5FxKuqdQ&amp;t=5m28s\">5:28</a> love your cat on the shelf", "comment_date": "2020-09-21T16:38:26Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Arkadiy Akimov", "comment_text": "why not ankor the user at the belt and make the system retract down for leaning and crouching and then just make the treadmill loose input device?", "comment_date": "2020-09-21T14:49:39Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "cREATOR", "comment_text": "Updates?<br>I just wanna know how close we are in Ready Player One", "comment_date": "2020-09-20T06:32:46Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Person Who Exists", "comment_text": "I hope one day in the future we have a new version of an arcade where there are bigger versions of this cuz thAt would work better for fast movements", "comment_date": "2020-09-19T22:46:40Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "RussianCatMan", "comment_text": "Your cat lol <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fvu5FxKuqdQ&amp;t=5m28s\">5:28</a>", "comment_date": "2020-09-19T16:20:56Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "John Monty", "comment_text": "I believe if you make multiple rings instead of trying to center the player and each ring is different sizes starting for small and getting larger from the center.

By using two different sensors ( accelerometer and gyroscope) mounted on both of the user&#39;s shoulders; notice when you want to turn in one direction while walking the first thing you rotate is your upper body ,most notably your shoulders. Using the data from the sensors you know if and how the upper body is turned so you get the intent of the user to rotate . The computer will act and turn the rotary union in the direction of the users upper body in real time bringing his lower body along. For the forward and backward motion i would attach pressure sensors either under the treadmill belt or in special shoes worn by the user . These would measure the force exerted by the user on various parts of his sole(foot) and determine the intention of the users movement along with the intensity of the move. From there you would program it to counteract that force and translate it into a movement.

Of course we don&#39;t in this case want to control the player but do the reverse with software and the same type of sensors that she was using to monitor the movement of your arms and legs then the software can interpret that movement back to the game counsel just like these visual devices do but with a radio signal or we may still be able to use the infrared sensors to flash the digital signals the software would translate that movement to the treadmill so it could anticipate your movement in real time which would probably take calibration but it is possible. I know somewhere around 45  to 60 hz actually  can affect our nerves so if we could pickup the signal and movement it can be translated back. It&#39;s the technology used on the cyborg roaches used I believe in a DARPA research to go into places were we don&#39;t have access to perform recon. Hey you have some really cool videos.  If we can bring together these two technologies we in the near future can translate teaching VR programs to train in skills very quickly.

If you can keep the belt sensor in the dead zone keeping the subject as close as possible to the center of X,Y position you can then use the trackers on the belt and feet to determine whether the subject is in motion, how fast they are moving and witch direction. This would allow you to use a harder breaking without the need for allot of dampining.  If the subject is not actually moving or gaining any momentum then there&#39;s no need for allot of dampining.  And by applying a harder breaking with a little dampining within the dead zone to a stop should give the subject a more realistic feeling of your body coming to a stop with the slight tug in the direction you were traveling or as if the floor jumped back an inch.  This is a natural reaction by the sudden change in your speed. This effect could be mimicked by detecting when the subjects foot sensors are no longer detecting weather the feet are performing a walking or running motion then dropping the speed by about 50% or so of current speed with about a 1&quot; or 2&quot; travel to a stop.<br>Sry I tend to ramble.

Except, that the stilts would actually be huge joysticks on a platform (maybe 2 or 3 feet high) beneath you, and the tops of the joystick levers would be strapped to your shoes. Pressure sensors in the shoes would provide feedback for lifting the foot while walking, so that intended direction of travel could be calculated by the sequencing of pressure with motion.<br><br><br>The stilts might need a telescoping section at the top end so that a player could have a somewhat normal gait, something like a gas strut or something that allows the foot to be raised without disengaging the boot.<br><br><br><br> Forward and reverse stepping/strafing could then be calculated. The player would have to be anchored in place in a belly harness, with only freedom to duck or jump.<br><br><br>The tricky part would be to be standing on these fairly long stilts, and having them stabilized in the vertical position so that standing still would be easy, instead of like riding a unicycle. It might be possible to do this with magnetic impulse rings low down on the stilts. The computer would sense torque on the stilts as the player attempts to walk and loosen off the field in a certain direction, but when no torque is detected, then the field becomes uniform once again and helps the player stand still and upright. Such a system would be close to frictionless and have very low momentum to deal with.<br><br><br>I&#39;m not dead certain that achieving this goal would be as much of a godsend as some people think. The distance you have to move around in a lot of FPS games, is tremendous. If you start to rescale the distance travelled while walking in VR, I think that might mess up your head.

This can revolutionize industries where heavy lifting is involved.  No longer do you need a fork lift to move the items, but a robot piloted by someone in this could perform the task.  I foresee this coming with some sort of feedback mechanism so the pilot can properly respond to changes in terrain and weight distribution.  If not, the robot would become off balance with the slightest turbulence introduced.  Essentially, the robot would be experiencing environmental feedback that the pilot would not.

After a few years driving in LA, I started to know when someone was about to cut me off, or switch lanes, or exit the highway, because the cues are there; they&#39;re just very subtle. My degree is in animation. There are so many things that lead into movement. It&#39;s almost impossible to just start moving in a direction. You lift your foot, you shift your weight, you change your breathing, you anticipate movements with their opposites... machine learning could learn to recognize all of that, and react really fast.

What I&#39;m thinking is if there was a way for the infinadeck to &quot;see&quot; the movement of the leg that is about to make a step then asses the direction based on the direction of said leg and start its motors. That would considerably improve the latency. So, what I mean by &quot;seeing&quot; the leg I mean using the sensors on the wall (the virtual model of a person) and feeding that information to the infinadeck. Of course, there would be a need of substantial gathering of data but that seems like a great way to improve this system.

In my mind, I\u2019m not sure if the treadmill would need to have electric at all, to be totally honest. Hold the players body in one spot using bungee chords, use the same design for having an omnidirectional treadmill, having the individual sections be able to move horizontally to provide a 360 degree range of motion etc. Then so long as the person is held in one spot via bungee, you can just use your leg power to move the treads.

Seem like if you could use a camera system much like that robot and hook it up to your treadmill you may get a lesser form of this latency that is being experienced. \ud83e\udd14", "comment_date": "2019-06-19T02:07:57Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Myztotic", "comment_text": "Ready Player One ay!\u2764\ufe0f", "comment_date": "2019-06-19T02:07:44Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "star", "comment_text": "Why would I want to exercise while playing games", "comment_date": "2019-06-19T00:13:54Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Roost", "comment_text": "When I saw ready player one.....<br><br><br>I was talking with my bro the other day saying \u201cman, someone would make billions making the Omni pad from that movie in real life.

From a gamers perspective it shouldnt be a problem to use a thumb to walk around ( pretty much all vr games useit anyways) and the best thig with taht would be that you can actually jump then, because if you keep the stick going in one direction and jump, you will move in VR and you will land on a moving surface in the real world too.

If it can detect when your muscles are tightening and getting ready to run and it can tell how fast you&#39;ll run based off of how much your muscles are flexing then I bet you it would get pretty dang close. Maybe the sleeves could be covered in many tiny sensors. Each sensor reads the distance between all of it&#39;s adjacent sensors and that distance data gets translated into what degree your muscles are flexing. It would have to be calibrated to each individual I bet by getting them to run up and down various speeds.

The only other way is by degrees of diagonal, lean, and leg and foot rotation allows.

And only then you would have to reason whether or not this &quot;you&quot; entity is real or illusory and can or cannot possess something like an intent. Your brain hasn&#39;t evolved to deal with all 3 answers at the same time, it has trouble with even just answering the first question to which many a philosopher modern and ancient will attest. For example, one could answer it with something like this: &quot;personhood is a way in which the human brain tricks itself into believing that it has some single centre that controls everything, and, that this centre has absolute, objective continuity, separate from even the brain and body, some kind of ultimate &quot;puppet master&quot; if you will, an illusion perpetuated by the networking effort between different colonies of neurons. However, if this is one&#39;s best shot at a scientifically literate guess, then intent looks either like progressive continuation of the same self-reinforced &quot;you illusion&quot;, or, as something which occurs at a much more basic level, one not always directly amenable or even detectable by the conscious mind, - part of the brain which typically has the job of creating a language-based abstraction, as well as rationalizing and justifying actions after they have already &quot;occurred&quot; to one. Maybe better way to tackle it would probably be to say that &quot;we have the experience of having an intent&quot; which we can corroborate, whether or not &quot;we&quot; actually &quot;have&quot; an &quot;intent&quot;.

Basically, if you had sensors in most of the places they put trackers for Mo-Cap, the treadmill would have the ability to not just keep up with a person, but actually predict the person&#39;s motion based upon early reads of each and every motion made. We telegraph every motion we make unless we are trained not to. However, just to move forward, we  have to shift off of center of gravity. If the system could read this at the shoulders, the hips, knees, then feet, it would be able to extrapolate the relative speed of the treadmill required much quicker and more accurately. Once moving, we also telegraph a stop by leaning back some as we slow ourselves to a stop. It is more extreme if we&#39;re moving forward quickly. We lean back and tend to bend our rear leg and plant even more firmly our front leg in a more rigid stance. This is why it&#39;s important to track the knee. It&#39;s relative position between foot and CG also in relation to our torso. That&#39;s how I see it in regards to what is necessary to fix this. But unfortunately, I&#39;m not a control programmer or an engineer, so really am only speaking from the stand-point of human biology and how we actually move, to determine we have to let the machine know exactly how our whole body is positioned, not just the 6 points of &#39;contact&#39; that it has. It needs a lot more than that. Especially to get natural fluid motion, such as crouching, duck-walking, sitting down, jumping, going prone, leaning from side to side, leaning with a leg out from side to side, moving from a walk to a jog to a run and back again with sudden stops thrown in for good measure. In order to get correct body positioning in game, as well as let the treadmill know what you&#39;re doing. Also until it reads that we are stepping AGAIN, it shouldn&#39;t move. We sometimes might want to put a foot in front of the other, behind the other, etc. and then perform a rotation or lean out one way or the other. Or just step once or twice then stop.This is also something it needs to predict, and knowing every position of ever relevant joint and point of contact, as well as relative position of the body, it&#39;s attitude, are all part of it moving correctly for someone&#39;s movement with as little lag and as accurately as possible.

I think the easy solution to the inertial delay problem would be to integrate a force sensing waistbelt with the existing Infinadeck. The waistbelt/harness would be connected to the ring with say 4 linkages for your x - y directions and be free to rotate within the outer ring. This would keep your center of mass in one place at all times in x-y space while allowing the possibility of moving in z space. Within the linkages would be force sensors to measure the direction and force your legs are pushing your center of mass. The rotation of the ring and harness would keep track of your absolute body direction with say a rotatory encoder instead of relying on the cameras.<br><br>When your foot pushes off the deck in any direction the force sensors in belt would sense the direction you intend to move in and that would give a definite acceleration vector for the deck to respond to. The harder you push into the belt the faster the deck would accelerate. Say you want to come to a sudden stop, the deck would push you into the belt in the opposite direction of motion sending a negative acceleration vector back to the deck and slow it down. Naturally in real life if you tried to come to a  sudden stop after running without bracing (say a longjump) the inertia of your body would cause result in a faceplant into the dirt.<br><br>The resultant feedback loop between the force inputs and the deck acceleration should allow you to speed up and slow down and even sidestep seamlessly with direct hardware inputs without any of the lag that would be present in a predictive positional software solution. <br><br>By its nature the fact that you have to supply a force against the waistbelt to move the deck means that you will have a positive feeling of resistance in your feet. By controlling the force input vs the acceleration the deck ratio it would allow your body to feel a slight resistance to acceleration and mimic the feeling of inertia without your body actually moving in space.", "comment_date": "2019-01-27T17:37:46Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "\u0418\u043b\u0438\u044f\u043d \u0411\u0435\u043b\u0435\u0432", "comment_text": "Can&#39;t you just create smart rolling shoes with some moving balls like old mouses in the middle with directional and position tracking, so just tie yourself to not run into a wall?

My idea for a similar technology would have been to use a belt that holds you in place and have the treadmill pushed by the movements of your feet. In that case no foot sensors would be needed to control avatar movement, though they would be useful for immersion. My idea of course has it&#39;s benefits, but it also has problems in that a belt would prevent you from doing certain common game actions like crouching/crawling, rolling, etc. (At least without building up the technology further to allow such things and in turn making it more expensive.)<br><br>I think it would be really cool to have more points of articulation such as your elbows, knees, and each of your fingers. There adding more motion sensors wouldn&#39;t fix the problem of immersion caused by not being able to actually touch things in the virtual world. I think one solution could be gloves which create a slight warming sensation when the player touches something in the game world. A related issue would be elevation. If your game world isn&#39;t flat you&#39;re not going to feel right walking around in it. The best idea I&#39;ve come up with is to have the direction the player is facing tracked and to tilt the treadmill accordingly.<br><br>I&#39;m very glad to see the guys at Infinadeck actually working to make this technology a reality.

This way when the player is coming in it slows down if they stopped walking until they are in the center, and with momentum in behind it, the turtle speed near center really should make it less noticable to players as the quicker moves makes them unstable.

If the infinadeck experiences this over shoot problem, it should sit motionless and make all adjustments inside the virtual reality. So let a person use the whole circle, don&#39;t keep resetting them to the center. Just keep them calibrated as standing at their position inside the circle relative to the center. And if they make moves toward the center, use that opportunity to calibrate them to the center by cheating the Virtual Reality position as might be necessary. So the glitch of non-actual movement, should happen in VR and never in real life. And if they do need to be corrected to the center for the sake of not running into the circle railing, then that correction in real life should happen always while they&#39;re in motion, by moving them a bit faster or a bit slower than they&#39;re actually going depending on whether they&#39;re ahead or behind the center relative to their direction of travel. Those very slight value differences while in motion will be far less jarring, than being standing still and having the thing toss you about throwing you off balance. Thing that might be causing this loss in definition is the width of the belts that measure the X axis. Were those belts all an eighth inch rather than 2 inches, you&#39;d probably have 1/16th the ambiguity in the measurements. Nother thing is the foot width and length must be known to the system, not merely a single point on the top of the shoe. The avatar should also be sized to match the player which makes a difference in how the player is moving relative to their avatar. This can also be scaled so as to make small people big or big people small in the VR.

I think a much better way to do this would be to simply use x/y sensors and let the person control the movement of the treadmill and mimic inertia by variable gear driven resistance using weights such as those little cars that you push forward faster and faster and then let them go and they slowly lose momentum. The ones that whine higher and higher pitched as they get faster. This leaves muscle memory to take up the slack, so that human intent will control the system instead of an algorithm trying to predict intent.

The problem is the difference of scale between the size of your step and the overall size of the space you&#39;re moving inside. If the possible size of your step is 0,7 m and the platform is 1,5 m, in two steps you can cross that space, which means the treadmill has to react very quickly with very high acceleration. If the room were 7 by 7 metres, the movement of the floor could be much smoother and the accelleration much more gradual. I actually suffer quite a lot from motion sickness and i think the problems of accelleration and counteraccelleration cannot be reasonably solved at this scale. Just immagine that in the real world, your brain is equipped to detect even the tiniest loss of traction or instability of the ground you step on. At this scale, this must feel like someone constantly tugging a carpet under your feet. Unfortunately, I&#39;m afraid it&#39;s not a problem of computer processing, but rather of physics. Even if the platform knew exactly how far you&#39;re going to step in a certain direction, didn&#39;t overshoot at all and started its movement immediately with zero lag, it would just feel as if you were on a slipery floor because the foot in contact with the floor would move to the back without your body moving at all.

This is because you don&#39;t want the player to have to consciously limit their motion speed so as not to step off the edge, but you still want the machine to be able to register the forces applied by their feet. Maybe this could be accomplished by allowing a pseudo-flexible sheet to glide over multiple servo-synchronized ball-bearings, but that would require starting from scratch with far more sophisticated materials.<br><br>Second, artificial inertia should be introduced using the motor controls on the deck. This is because the inertia experienced by the player in real life should depend on the in-game weight (among other characteristics) of the avatar. A larger avatar&#39;s acceleration is slower, and likewise a smaller one&#39;s is faster. <br><br>Third, the foot-trackers are not being implemented correctly. Instead of just being used to map the player&#39;s foot positions in-game, they can also be used by the treadmill itself to predict where the player intends to step. If their center of mass is not above their feet, it&#39;s clear that they&#39;re about to take a step in an easily identifiable direction. Similarly, with enough sensor points, the amount of force being applied on the treadmill deck is calculable without actually measuring it, if you know the player&#39;s weigh in real life. This could allow the deck to keep the person&#39;s center of gravity almost EXACTLY in the center, regardless of whether they are even touching the treadmill, and would allow interpretation of jumping motions in-game.<br><br>A few notes: <br>- The attachment of the player to the treadmill ring with cables is not ideal, because the player could hit those cables with their arms in reality. A magnetic suspension system (or something similarly non-solid) might be able to replace this, though, which would allow 100% confidence that the player wouldn&#39;t fall off the treadmill in real life, as well as an easier way to make inertia felt by the player.<br>- Full-body haptic suits would solve a lot of user experience problems, like the one above, and allow for more sensor points and therefore a more accurate digital model of the player&#39;s position.<br>- Alternatively to physical sensors, multiple cameras could be placed around the deck. This would result in more comprehensive player-modeling, but would be pointless if you still want haptic feedback (see below).<br>- The most realistic (but not necessarily the most fun) virtual reality experience would have no &quot;in-game menu&quot; of sorts except for a log-out button. All items would have to be physically placed in your bag, without an inventory menu, and the levels of sensory input and output would be perceptually identical to those of real-life. This means the camera idea would work great for input, because there are no buttons to press anymore, but you&#39;d still need a haptic suit to allow the player to actually feel the in-game world.", "comment_date": "2018-07-09T16:21:13Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "el Dereko", "comment_text": "This is too rad.

(basically are the perpendicular tracks fighting while moving under the surface of the foot?)<br><br>2. The back sensor is awesome, I assume the centre of the gravity, and really useful for tracking how weight is distributed when bending over, crouching, or squatting. The machine in theory could calculate that using it to provide stabilisation as a &#39;user&#39; moves toward a crouching position.

This can solve the latency issue by keeping the person in the same place in 3D space while the infinadeck adjusts the player back to the center of the ring - i.e. move in the opposite direction the infinadeck is moving the person. Since these adjustments are small, the 2nd rig that the infinadeck is on will not need to be particularly big. The acceleration issue is solved in pretty much a similar manner - by using the 2nd rig to ensure that the person is NOT in the same place in 3D space when the person stops/starts moving. For example if the person stops suddenly, the infinadeck alone will stop as well (+ adjustments from the 2nd rig) and the rig can bring the entire deck backwards to mimic the deceleration felt by the person in VR.<br><br>This will likely require 2 separate &quot;pathways&quot;, one to stabilise the infinadeck and one to mimic acceleration and deceleration, so I&#39;m not sure how this will be able to function in real time but sounds like a potential step up from a &quot;treadmill made from treadmills&quot; to a &quot;treadmill made from treadmills on another treadmill&quot; of sorts.<br><br>TLDR: Place the infinadeck on another x-y axis rig to manipulate the person&#39;s position in 3D space while the infinadeck deals with keeping the person in the same place relative to the ring.", "comment_date": "2018-07-06T18:36:08Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "pedro jose", "comment_text": "I love your cat and experience, waiting for this and 4k minimum scree vr sets :D", "comment_date": "2018-07-06T15:19:41Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "darzuadrian", "comment_text": "I think they could fix this issue if the velocity of the treadmill is controlled by the position of the feet sensor from the middle of the platform.

It would look like you were walking on a mirror of yourself.  So you take a step and one of the hydraulic foot plates matches your foot position in X,Y then stops as your actual foot comes down to land on it at the Z (height) plane.  Then as you take a step it moves towards your center of mass but in VR it looks like you have stepped forwards.  These plates under your feet can track any position so you could run, spin, jump, climb stairs, walk up or down hills and in the real world the plates are moving around to act as a dynamic floor, in VR it is near-like the real thing.  The only element missing would be inertia so there would be a brain-body disconnect, a harness would be required.  <br>Obviously this is more robotics and tracking than treadmill but it would allow for more motion.  More costly and more dangerous too I imagine.    <br><br>A spin off this idea is to have an Exoskeleton around your legs and hips while you are harnessed.  The foot plate is inside the exoskeleton so it only slides up to meet your foot when you touch ground level and then it goes rigid as you take a step then as your leg raises the foot plate moves down and away from your actual foot.  This removes any dangerous hydraulic arms from the concept although it has less resistance for that real life feeling.<br><br>Another idea is walking inside a cube which is like an inverted and fluid pin cushion, combine this with the Infinideck.  The pins act like the CG geometry but always recenter you as you move about.  You could even represent objects or other people with the pin rods.

When XBOX users use a game with Kinect, the little cameras in the machine are programmed to watch for certain body movements. If you wanted to walk, run, or turn you could just simply do it in place without actually going anywhere. The cameras could be programmed to respond to this type of movement and make the scenery in your game move accordingly. So while you would be going nowhere in reality, your virtual self would be propelled forward by the graphics. The only problem I can see with this scenario is that if the player for some reason were to get too immersed in the game and start actually walking they might hit a wall or something else in the room. So what I&#39;m thinking is that those cameras need to also be programmed to watch for actual walking and warn the user immediately on screen that he or she is in probable danger.

Second, i believe that the biggest problem that virtual reality faces today, is the immersion issue. Now i have an idea for a virtual reality immersion device which is very cheap and easy to build, and with current technology very profitable to mass produce. For obvious reasons i will not go into further detail, but i can safely say that the road this company travels is not the right road. My idea will use direct input from the user itself, which can even be analog or digital, in stead of continuous scanning and reacting to the position of the user. Which in my opinion is never going to work perfectly, simply because there are a lot of calculations needed for getting the position and moving the device accordingly. Let alone the distance the signals have to travel. My idea eliminates every millisecond of lag, and can theoretically use the common joystick interface of any computer or console. Which is definitely a must for backwards compatability. Now, i haven&#39;t got a prototype yet, simply because i don&#39;t have the knowledge or money needed to build one. If you are interested, maybe you can contact me for building a prototype, and i will provide you with detailed information on how to build it. And who knows, maybe we will get very rich very fast, by solving the greatest problem VR has faced, ever. Last, keep up the good work, i enjoy all your videos! Greetings, Chris.

On top of that like the size of the game the server capacity would have to be huge as well. I know computers are getting more and more powerful and able to store more and more into small spaces but to run a VR at the moment, you still need a decently powerful computer - and computers aren&#39;t cheap, making the game won&#39;t be cheap, VR tech won&#39;t be cheap, games are getting more and more expensive and because of how vast the game would be, the game wont be cheap. So just for the fact that it would be so expensive for the games company and the consumer, I don&#39;t think anyone would take the risk. <br><br>But I&#39;m not saying that we wont get a game to an extent similar as you already have games like No Man Sky, Elite Dangerous, Minecraft(modded as well), GTA.

To fix this issue, you got to add lot of calculation to balance things out and, as state in the video, it&#39;s not really possible to have it perfect due to the fact that it can&#39;t read your brain.<br><br>The solution I though about (which is one of those &quot;up-to-come&quot; idea I&#39;m keeping for the future) is that instead using the treadmill as just an adaptator which requires motors and quite a bit of calculation to balance the footing range and zeroing the user in the center, why not just using it as an input device in a similar way to the old computer&#39;s mouse ball.<br><br>This solution would allow the whole device to be actually compatible even with VR situation which involves positions that aren&#39;t possible using the zeroing balancing feature of the Infinadeck. For example, the Infinadeck doesn&#39;t allow you to be in something like a racing car as you can&#39;t really be in a sitting position. The same applies if you&#39;re trying to be in a couch or prone position as the device has quite some limitation there.<br><br>In the case of the Ready Player One movie, what I&#39;m writing about can even be seen in a way where the player are attached by strings from the roof (while in the truck) or with the player being attached with a kind of jacket to a spine structure.<br><br>Having the strings to be adjusted to the right height so that the player can touch the ground just enough to &quot;push&quot; the treadmills and using that movement of the treadmills as direct input would be so easy to implement with so little computation that it could also be compatible with existing titles in a matter of days (for movements in the world). The elevation would be what would requires the most work in this solution as the elevation would have to be calculated based on the position of the body parts in the virtual world. Again, this is still relatively simple, in terms of information and data, to get from a digital world.

For instance, if the user moves forward, the treadmill slants forward. The forward tilt of the plane would trigger the treadmill to move &quot;uphill&quot;, which would counter the feeling of the downhill slant. The forward slant can then be gradually reduced based upon the weight placement of the user. When the user stops, the opposite happens, meaning a backward slant to counter the stopping of the treadmill. The slanting mechanism should be entirely weight based, and the movement of the treadmill should be calculated on the transfer of weight distribution from one side of the foot to the other. This would be possible for any movement, as weight distribution is guaranteed no matter if side stepping, walking backwards, or even jumping. It could predict forward momentum of a stationary jump and move the treadmill backward and slant forward at the same time to prevent the user from actually moving, and return to level position once the user leaves the treadmill plane.", "comment_date": "2018-05-12T05:08:05Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Jacob Waters", "comment_text": "Hey!

And this is just for the flat ground, now think that you want to go up some stairs, well the spider-like legs provide support when your leg is a bit higher, and that will make you feel that you are acutaly going up a stair, but this means that you actualy have to go up in the real world aswell to feel the force necesary for you you to go up that stair, and if there are for example 100 stairs, well, you will hit the roof, so you have to somehow get back into the midle of the room without actualy feeling that you are going down. But let`s say that this problem does not exist, or it was solved, think that you want to jump a fence, you first want to put your hands on the fence, than the spider-like legs will &quot;harden&quot; and make you feel the fence, and than put one of your legs up, and than again, the spider-like legs will stop your foot, and so on... But lets say that you want to jump 2 meters down, well you will &quot;fall&quot; a bit, and than the spider-like legs will again &quot;harden&quot; and than because of the inertia that you have from falling that &quot;bit&quot; will make you feel that you actually fell down, now, the problems: lets say that you are 120 Kg, I dont think that 20 or 40 spider-like legs can stop you from falling so quickly that you fell that the grond is hard, plus if you room is let`s say 4 meters in hieght from you, up and down, you can kinda simulate the 2 meter fall , although you somehow need to get back into the midle of the room without you feeling it, plus if you jump from a plane (in VR) how to simulate that? plus if you fall somehow on your arm and in real life you would have broken it, I don`t think that you would like to get out of the VR with a broken hand. And to take thing more further, let`s say tha you have an even finer exoskeleton on you that will improve the feeling and if it`s fine enough, you can probably even feel texture, but this envolves alot of other problems that I won`t say right now bec this comment is already too long. And another problem will be: how to calculate so many positions and textures and let`s face it, I don`t think you want to see a world so texture-less and with plain colors like the VR on these days, but I think that you can put alot of video cards in sync and processors and if you make a game made for this, <a href=\"http://it.will.be.guge/\">It.Will.Be.Guge</a>.

(i&#39;ve just came up with a weird thought right now, imagine they made a mini version for your fingers to do the walking xD) so anyway, you&#39;re standing in the center, you move a foot forward, it centers you by shifting your back a tiny bit. if it slightly over shoots, i&#39;d say, don&#39;t let it ever confuse the player by shifting back again, just wait for the player to take his next step, and center him like always. it&#39;s the ultimate sync. a.k.a the treadmill will know at the current moment, the player isn&#39;t centered, so when the player moves, one foot forward, it understands the difference like always, but also overshoots him back to the center in the moving direction. it&#39;s unnoticeable. and as the technology continues to get improved, the accuracy of the shifting will continue to improve, and will only be a just in case sync aspect. it&#39;s still going to understand exactly the motion the player moved, but still re-center.<br><br>and what if the person is on one foot, then hops to the other foot? you wouldn&#39;t want somebody&#39;s foot being dragged to the center and probably tripping. so this sync up fixes that completely, it just waits for the user to put down his other foot down. it&#39;s just for the safety of the player in the real world. if he wants to be weird and hop for some reason, he can, but the technology won&#39;t move him. he can hop into the barrier, and realize when you&#39;re running after enemies with a gun, hopping isn&#39;t really effective. if in the game, the player needs to jump, they could detect the player crouching, then the pressure vanishing. wherever the players feet land is the direction jumped.<br><br>actually, i used pressure to explain the syncing easier. the syncing can still be implemented with trackers. it can still be simulated the exact same way. you know where the treadmill is, where the feet are in relation to it. if they&#39;re on the ground or in the air, which foot the player is balancing on, etc... so trackers are more accurate, and specifically for the jumping. so when both your feet leave the base level (or ground zone), it&#39;s then using the direction they headed in to jump, at the exact same time as the player, instead of after he lands back on the treadmill.<br><br>and also, perhaps for jumping/hopping, the user has to hold onto the barrier, for the users safety in the real life. and you can still jump forwards/backwards/left/right with your feet. (quick reminder, when jumping, the treadmill doesn&#39;t need to shift anywhere. it only does that to center the player, when he walks) what would really be interesting is wall running like in black ops 3. they&#39;d really need to up their game, and add some harness for you to sit in, which can raise you off the ground when you jump your feet onto the spiral wall treadmill underneath the railing. which would mean to get in this thing, you&#39;d have to climb in/out, like it&#39;s a hot tub. lol<br><br>also, the wall running wouldn&#39;t be a necessary, it wouldn&#39;t actually be tracking movement, it&#39;d just be an experience for the player to feel, and the treadmill part of it, just to keep the players feet in the same place, almost like a hamster. xD<br><br>anyway. those are just my random thoughts.", "comment_date": "2018-04-26T03:01:37Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Ebag tay", "comment_text": "imagine if he was talking like @<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fvu5FxKuqdQ&amp;t=9m50s\">9:50</a> but he was facing the wall lmaoo", "comment_date": "2018-04-26T01:24:59Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Bababoom Baboom", "comment_text": "yeah, but ... why don&#39;t they do this with a  stationary bike instead, and just allow you to peddle around virtual cities?

I would never have thought of simulating motion with a machine like this. This is going to be one of the biggest breakthroughs for vr!<br>This will probably never be seen by Infinadeck, but even so, may I suggest a change to the tracking control? You&#39;re right, the biggest hurdle with the machine is decreasing the response time. Currently you&#39;re trying to do so based on cg position, which is non-predictive. However, if you change the tracking control to feet position, you could write an adjusted algorithm that is \u201cpredictive,\u201d and therefore could essentially be instantaneous, no major dampening necessary. It might require a bit more math and programming skills, but I think it is the only way to get the response time and disruption to the user near zero.<br>I would program the software to keep the user centered on the machine based on the center of mass of the user&#39;s two feet collectively. The machine could predict the direction the user will walk as soon as one foot starts to move, whether forward, backward, or sidestepping, and therefore start centering the user immediately, rather than waiting for the torso to catch up. Also, this means you could shift positions, sway on your feet, and bend over without triggering the machine. It would feel natural with minimal readjustment. Although placing the tracker for position control on the feet introduces additional z movement, the algorithm will continue to throw out z- axis information as I assume it does on the current iteration. Or...<br><br>A second (third?) generation design could eventually answer the problem of climbing in vr by using the z information from the feet position to map to vr and use some kind of hydraulic (for example) boot to provide z motion feedback, similar to a stepper exercise machine.<br>This is very hypothetical so I could be wrong about how this would work, but... Unlike a stepper, it will have to provide unequal resistance to the feet if necessary. Z-centering would have to depend on the vr map. If the \u201cground\u201d is flat, the foot that&#39;s not stepping would stay at it&#39;s z-position. If climbing, the software would have to calculate the z-distance a foot would appear to travel for a given slope or item height and provide the appropriate resistance to the appropriate feet at the appropriate times: allowing non-resistive motion when the foot is in the \u201cair\u201d and providing resistance as soon as the foot teaches the level of the \u201cslope,\u201d meeting the foot at that point and then lowering down until the end of the stride. The goal of the algorithm for z-centering should be to keep the feet at a preset height above the deck, \u201cabove\u201d so that stepping down can be possible. Not sure this is actually physically doable in combination with x and y as well, but I could see someone wearing boots and bring on the machine, or incorporating the x and y into the treads of a stepper/climber z-axis boot.", "comment_date": "2018-04-19T05:52:55Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "PotionZ1", "comment_text": "Pretty much exersizing in a video game", "comment_date": "2018-04-19T05:41:23Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Bad Kitty Moar", "comment_text": "it&#39;s still move in x and y direction.. add z direction and we can call it Omnidirectional.", "comment_date": "2018-04-19T05:40:50Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Saw wil", "comment_text": "!!!!Hi, I have 19 experiments to share it may show the path of light, neutrinos and strings.

Pressing forward on the controller moves the treadmill backwards relative to where your body is facing. The speed at which the treadmill moves during typical \u201cwalking\u201d is customizable to the user. I imagine you would have the user take several steps forward backwards left and right to find these speeds. <br><br>Basically this means if I want to walk forward, I would slide my thumb forward on whatever controller as I start walking. At the same time, the treadmill accelerates relative to the acceleration of the controller input up to my set walking speed. <br><br>Potential challenges I see with this:<br><br>While I kinda got used to it I imagine people won\u2019t be perfect at pressing forward exactly when they start walking forward. I think tracking systems like the infinadeck are necessary to make small corrections and keep the user in the center of the treadmill. <br><br>This only allows for one speed. If you want environments that allow users to walk at multiple speeds, you would need to record these as well. After that you could map a slow or fast option to buttons that are also pressed durning locomotion. (Plenty of games already have these in the form of sprint or stealth buttons). <br><br>The biggest problem I realized while writing this is turning. If I turn while walking, the infinadeck has to do the same guess work it does throughout the video. When will the user turn? At what rate will they turn? When will they stop turning?<br><br>If people could think up solutions to this, that would be good. The best thing I could think of is also mapping this turning to controls. If you want to keep this similar to common first person controls, one button controls what direction the body is in while the other controls which direction you walk relative to the avatar\u2019s position. <br><br>And this seems like a lot more for the player to keep track of while walking.", "comment_date": "2018-04-18T03:20:35Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Arturo Garcia", "comment_text": "wow i love sword art online i liked ready player one and see this tech being developed is so exciting", "comment_date": "2018-04-18T03:15:47Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "RJ Raynoe", "comment_text": "Instantly noticed the voltron shirt.", "comment_date": "2018-04-18T03:12:29Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Nils E", "comment_text": "Hi great Video again!

The problem with that is that they need very good positional and speed tracking accuracy, and have well optimized PID-like control of the trademill, because there is a lot of mass in the trademill + subject on it, speeds should be as big as possible on average, but the accelerations and jerks should be as small as possible, otherwise the noise will be high, and subject will get out of balance. The best way to achieve that is to have big trademill (with accurate and powerful motors), where you can afford smaller speeds and time to reposition subject back to the center, i.e. they can run and even jump around like crazy, and the trademill will still do its job fine, even if it is moving relatively slowly, because they also have time and space to accelerate and decelerate without subject noticing too much or getting out of balance.", "comment_date": "2018-04-18T00:25:11Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "GTA V Best Moments", "comment_text": "This sux still.", "comment_date": "2018-04-18T00:20:54Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Mauricio Fernandez", "comment_text": "Hey Dustin, I think your clock has abusted LED, when it went to <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fvu5FxKuqdQ&amp;t=10m23s\">10:23</a> sometimes it was lighting only 2 sqares.

Imagine if you will that  the belt you wear has 8 pistons, balloons, whatever, placed equally around it. These press against you monents before or alongside the treadmill and corresponds to its direction of movement.

A person would move their foot with the intent on changing or starting movement before their hip might lurch forward. If you throw away all the inertia and acceleration models they have now and instead use a slow and fast rebound system like car suspensions, it would even be possible for users to adjust this on their own and set it to their preferences.<br><br>Here&#39;s my idea for how they can do this:<br><br>FAST REBOUND: take the average of the players feet x,y coordinates and keep that at center at all times, with 100% speed and no added latency. If the player moves his foot forward 30cm, the treadmill moves back 15, setting both feet 15 cm apart from center. The player can change directions all the time without ever leaving the center of the treadmill. If the player begins to fall due to discomfort somehow, their feet would move away from center, and the machine would react to this in the same way, pushing the players feet right back under him/herself and preventing a fall. Because I have no way of testing this myself, I have to rely on imagination to think of what this might be like - when i take a step forward, the machine moves my foot backwards and keeps me standing, but I may feel a sense of tripping forward, or it may feel like my steps are longer than I intend. To counter this, the effect of fast rebound could be set at lower percentages, meaning it&#39;ll slow down movement instead of completely cancelling it: eg, at 50%, taking a 30cm step forward would only set the treadmill back 7.5 cm, I will now be 7.5 cm off center, but my movement is more natural. However the player will drift away from center, Hence, the second type of centering...<br><br>SLOW REBOUND: similar to the fast rebound, except it is capped at a certain acceleration rate to minimize the player feeling any unexpected inertia. If Fast rebound is set to 50% and the player is drifting away from center at half walking speed, the slow rebound will slowly accelerate to bring the player back to center, it is allowed to travel faster than the player to &quot;catch up&quot; and bring the player back to center, but velocity and direction are not allowed to change at a rate faster than a set amount, this is so that the unnatural recentering movement remains as subtle as possible, with the goal being that the player does not notice it at all.<br><br>From here the adjustments made will be a trade between comfort, playable space, and manoeuvrability. The higher the fast rebound, the faster the player can change directions, or run, but it may cause nausea/discomfort, or it may be difficult to get used to. The slower the fast rebound, the more natural the player movement will feel, but the player will drift from center. The lower the slow rebound, it becomes less noticeable for the player but the player can step out of bounds if changing direction or velocity too quickly - requires larger treadmill sizes, the faster the slow rebound, the more discomfort the player might feel when the machine centers, but the player drift will be more manageable with larger changes in velocity and direction, keeping high manoeuvrability with a smaller treadmill surface.<br><br>If the Fast Rebound works like I&#39;d imagined, they only need to adjust the ratio of the two values to get it to feel comfortable, or they could start sales and leave those for users to adjust to their own preference, and they could sell different sizes of treadmill. Larger treadmills would allow more natural feeling movement without sacrificing the players reaction time and smaller treadmills have to sacrifice one of either.<br><br>Is suspension and shocks technology in cars relevant to this? Could they be referencing things like Bose&#39;s electromagnetic suspension for guidance? They also had to react to random motion from the road surface and produce smooth motion for the driver, Fast rebound is used to react to high frequency bumps and slow rebound is used to make sure that the bumps can be corrected without exceeding the limits of how far the suspension can compress and expand.<br><br>I don&#39;t mean any disrespect to the researchers and inventors of infinadeck, I&#39;m just genuinely curious if that&#39;s been tried and also am very eager to see this product hit the markets as soon as possible!

Its followers&#39; number is over 1.5 billion worldwide. Along with Judaism and Christianity, it is considered to be one of the three Abrahamic traditions.<br><br>4) There are five pillars of practice in Islam. These practices must be undertaken with the best of effort in order to be considered a true Muslim: A) Shahadah - declaration of faith in the oneness of God and that Muhammad is the last Prohet of God. B) Formal prayer five times a day. C) Fasting during the daylight hours in the month of Ramadan. D) Poor-due &quot;tax&quot; - 2.5% of one&#39;s savings given to the needy at the end of each year. E) Pilgrimage to MeKka at least once, if physically and financially able.<br><br>5) There are six articles of faith in Islam. These are the basic beliefs that one must have in order to be considered a true Muslim. They are belief in: A) the One God. B) all the Prophets of God. C) the original scriptures revealed to Prophets Moses, David, Jesus, and Muhammad. D) the Angels. E) the Day of Judgment and the Hereafter. F) the Divine decree (or destiny).<br><br>6) Islam is a complete way of life that governs all facets of life: moral, spiritual, social, political, economical, intellectual, etc.<br><br>7) Islam is one of the fastest growing religions in the world. To become Muslim, a person of any race or culture must say a simple statement, the shahadah, which means bearing witness to the belief in the One God and that Prophet Muhammad is the last Prophet of God.<br><br>8.&quot;Allah&quot; is an Arabic word that means &quot;God&quot;. Muslims also believe that &quot;Allah&quot; is the proper noun of God.<br><br>9) Allah is not the God of Muslims only. He is the God of all people and all creations. Just because people refer to God using different terms does not mean that they are different gods. Spanish people refer to God as &quot;Dios&quot; and French people refer to God as &quot;Dieu&quot;, yet they are all the same God. Interestingly, most Arab Jews and Arab Christians refer to God as &quot;Allah&quot;. And the word Allah in Arabic appears on the walls of many Arab churches.<br><br>10) The Islamic concept of God is that He is Loving, Merciful, and Compassionate. But Islam also teaches that He is Just and swift in punishment. Nevertheless, Allah once said to Prophet Muhammad, &quot;My Mercy prevails over My Wrath.&quot; Islam teaches a balance between fear and hope, protecting one from both complacency and despair.<br><br>11) Muslims believe that God has revealed 99 of His Names (or Attributes) in the Holy Qur&#39;an. It is through these Names that one can come to know the Creator. A few of these Names are: the All-Merciful, the All-Knower, the Protector, the Provider, the Near, the First, the Last, the Hidden, and the Peace.<br><br>12) Muslims believe in and acknowledge all the Prophets of God, from Adam to Jesus. Muslims believe that they brought the Message of peace and submission (Islam) to different peoples at different times. Muslims also believe that these Prophets were &quot;Muslims&quot; because they submitted their wills to God.<br><br>13) Muslims neither worship Muhammad nor pray through him. Muslims solely worship the Unseen and Omniscient Creator, Allah.<br><br>14) Muslims accept the original unaltered Torah (the Gospel of Moses) and the original Gospel (the Gospel of Jesus) since they were revealed by God. However, none of those original scriptures are in existence today, in their entirety. Therefore, Muslims follow the subsequent, final, and preserved Revelation of God, the Holy Qur&#39;an.<br><br>15) The Holy Qur&#39;an was not authored by Muhammad. It is the speech of God, revealed to Muhammad, and written into physical form by his companions.<br><br>16) The Holy Qur&#39;an has neither flaws nor contradictions. The original Arabic scriptures have never been changed or tampered with.<br><br>17) Actual seventh century&#39;s copies of the Holy Qur&#39;an, complete and intact, are on display in museums in Turkey and many other places around the world.<br><br>18) If all copies of the Holy Qur&#39;an  in the world today were burned and destroyed,<br>the original Arabic would still remain. This is because over 11 million Muslims memorise it,  verbatim; they are called Hafiz (or &quot;preservers&quot;) they have memorized the Quranic text letter for letter from beginning to end, every word and syllable. Also, chapters (Surahs)  from the Qur&#39;an are precisely recited from memory by every Muslim in each of the five daily prayers.<br><br>19) Muslims do not believe in the concept of &quot;vicarious atonement&quot; but rather believe in the law of personal responsibility. Islam teaches that each person is responsible for his or her own actions. On the Day of Judgment, Muslims believe that every person will be resurrected and will have to answer before God for their words, thoughts, and deeds. Consequently, a practicing Muslim is always striving to be righteous.<br><br>20) Islam was not spread by the sword. It was spread by the word (Islamic teachings) and the example of its followers. Islam teaches that there is no compulsion in religion (the Holy Qur&#39;an <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fvu5FxKuqdQ&amp;t=2m25s\">2:25</a>6 and 10:99).<br><br>21) Terrorism, unjustified violence and the killing of innocent people are absolutely forbidden in Islam. Islam is a way of life that is meant to bring peace to a society, whether its people are Muslims or not. The extreme actions of those who claim to be Muslims may be, among other things, a result of their ignorance or uncontrolled anger. Tyrant rulers and those who commit acts of terrorism in the name of Islam are simply not following Islam. These people are individuals with their own views and political agendas. Fanatical Muslims are no more representatives of the true Islamic teachings than Timothy McVeigh or David Koresh are of Christianity. Extremism and fanaticism are problems that are common to all religious groups. Anyone who thinks that all Muslims are terrorists should remember that the famous boxer Muhammad Ali, perhaps the most celebrated person of our era, is a practicing Muslim.<br><br>22) The word &quot;jihad&quot; does not mean &quot;holy war&quot;. Instead, it means the inner struggle that one endures in trying to submit their will to the will of God. Some Muslims may say they are going for &quot;jihad&quot; when fighting in a war to defend themselves or their fellow Muslims, but they only say this because they are considering that it will be a tremendous struggle. But there are many other forms of jihad which are more relevant to the everyday life of a Muslim such as the struggles against laziness, arrogance, stinginess, or the struggle against tyrant transgressors or against the temptations of Satan, or against one&#39;s own ego, etc.<br><br>23) Women are not oppressed in Islam. Any Muslim man that oppresses a woman is not following Islam. Among the many teachings of Prophet Muhammad that protected the rights and dignity of women is his saying, &quot;...the best among you are those who treat their wives well.&quot; (Tirmidhi)<br><br>24) Islam grants women numerous rights in the home and in society. Among them are the right to earn money, to financial support, to an education, to an inheritance, to being treated kindly, to vote, to a dowry, to keep their maiden name, to worship in a mosque (masjid), ... etc.<br><br>25) Muslim women wear the head-covering (hijab) in fulfillment of God&#39;s decree to dress modestly. From a practical standpoint, it serves to identify one as attempting to follow God in daily life and, therefore, protects women from unwanted advances from men. This type of modest dress has been worn by righteous women throughout history such as Mary, the mother of Jesus.<br><br>26) Arranged marriages are allowed in Islam but are not required. Whereas &quot;forced&quot; marriages, usually stemming from cultural practice, are forbidden. Divorce is permissible, however, reconciliation is what is most encouraged. But if there are irreconcilable differences then Islam permits a fair and just divorce; only as a last resort if life between both husband and wife proves impossible.<br><br>27) Islam and the &quot;Nation of Islam&quot; are two different religions. Islam is a religion for all races and enjoins the worship of the One Unseen God who, Muslims believe , never took human form. The &quot;Nation&quot;, on the other<br><br>hand, is a movement<br>geared towards non-whites and teaches that God appeared in the form of Fard Muhammad in 1930 and that Elijah Muhammad (a man who died in 1975) was a prophet of God. These beliefs clearly contradict the basic Islamic theology outlined in the Qur&#39;an. The followers of &quot;the Nation&quot; adhere to some Islamic principles that are mixed with many other teachings that are alien to Islam. To better understand the difference between the two, read about Malcolm X, his pilgrimage to Mecca and his subsequent comments to the media. Islam teaches equality amongst all the races (Holy Qur&#39;an <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fvu5FxKuqdQ&amp;t=49m13s\">49:13</a>).<br><br>28) Not all Muslims are  Arabs. Islam is a universal religion, and a complete way of life , which includes followers from all races of people. There are Muslims in and from virtually every country in the world. Arabs only constitute about 20% of Muslims worldwide. Indonesia has the largest population of Muslims with over 220 million.<br><br>29) In the five daily prayers, Muslims face the Kaaba in MeKka, Arabia. It is a cube-shaped stone structure that was originally built by Prophet Adam and later rebuilt by Prophet Abraham. Muslims believe that the Kaaba was the first house of worship on Earth dedicated to the worship of the One and Only God. Muslims do not worship the Kaaba. It serves as a central focal point for Muslims around the world, unifying them in worship and symbolizing their common belief, spiritual focus and direction. Interestingly, the inside of the Kaaba is empty.<br><br>30) The hajj is a simultaneous pilgrimage to the Kaaba made by millions of Muslims each year. It is performed to commemorate the struggles of Abraham, Ishmael and Hagar in submitting their wills to God.", "comment_date": "2018-04-17T15:02:29Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "\u0623\u0644\u064a\u0627\u0633 \u0639\u064a\u0633\u0627\u0648\u064a", "comment_text": "30 facts about the prophet Muhammad -PBUH-:<br><br>1. He was a descendant of the Prophet Ismail the son of Prophet Ibrahim. <del>PBUT</del><br><br>2. Prophet Muhammad PBUH was born in Mecca.<br><br>3. The year was 570 A.D.<br><br>4. Shortly after his birth his mother died.<br><br>5. His father was already dead before his birth. So he became orphan.<br><br>6. During this time his uncle Aboo Talib and his grand father Abdul-mutlib took care of him.<br><br>7. At the age of nine he started going on trade trips along with his uncle.<br><br>8. He met with people of different nations and religions during those trips.<br><br>9. His character was respected by all. People throughout Medina including the Jews gave him the name of \u201cThe Trustworthy.\u201d<br><br>10. In one of his trips he met a Christian scholar, the scholar said to his uncle that he will one day do something great and I can see it because all the trees, mountains and sea are in the bow in front of him.<br><br>11. When he got 25, he got a proposal from Khadija for marriage which he accepted and thus they got married. Khadija was 40 years of age at the time of marriage.<br><br>12. For the first 54 years of his life he had only one wife. His only wife till 50th year of his life was Sayyida Khadija.<br><br>13. They had sons but they died in their childhood.<br><br>14. Prophet Muhammed married Sayyida Aicha when she was 9 years old. 1400 years ago it was something very common to marry young girls, in fact they were not considered young girls, and rather they were considered young women back then. It is a historic fact that girls from the ages of 9 to 14 were being married in Europe, Asia, and Africa, in fact even in the United States girls at the age of 10 were also being married just more than a century ago. Yet with these facts no historian claims that all these people were sick perverts, historians would call anyone who made such a claim to be arrogant and very stupid who has no grasp or understanding of history.<br><br>15. He never ate alone. He invited others and then ate with them.<br><br>16. He encouraged the washing of hands before and after eating food.<br><br>17. He regularly visited the poor and ill.<br><br>18. Upon visiting a person, he used to greet them and then take their permission before entering the house and encourage others to do the same as a mark of respect.<br><br>19. He used to mend his clothes, repair his shoes and sweep the floor as well as do the household shopping during his married life.<br><br>20. As people of Mecca at that time were involved in many sinful activities, like they killed their daughters, did drinking, rape, and killing of innocent people, Prophet Muhammad did not admire those activities at all and to have solitude and peace he went to cave Hira.<br><br>21. Once when he was in the cave Hira he saw Angel Gabriel there. The angel said to him \u00ab read in the name of Allah \u00bb, Prophet Muhammad replied that I can neither read nor write I am an illiterate.<br><br>22. After Angel Gabriel came again with revelations, he started preaching Islam to people.<br><br>23. He used to preach to people, but avoided preaching to excess to avoid annoying people.<br><br>24. He sometimes prayed so much his legs swelled. In one incident, he was asked why he offered such an unbearable prayer and he replied with \u201cShall I not be a thankful slave (to Allah)?\u201d<br><br>25. He sent letters to Kings and leaders beyond Arabia inviting them to Islam.<br><br>26. Pagans and Non-Muslims did harm to Prophet Muhammad PBUH and other Muslims by different means but Prophet Muhammad had patience and perseverance.<br><br>27. His Prophethood lasted for a long period of 23 years, during which he received Revelations from Allah.<br><br>28. He never proclaimed himself as anyone or anything Divine.<br><br>29. His name is now one of the most popular names in the world.<br><br>30. After 23 years of Prophet-hood Muhammad (p.b.u.h) died and after his death Islam spread to other places too because of the efforts of his Caliphs. The revelations of Allah on Prophet Muhammad (p.b.u.h) were compiled in Quran after his death.", "comment_date": "2018-04-17T15:02:13Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "theoneonlyone", "comment_text": "what about letting the infinadeck being pushed by the first step to get the system going wiith the same feeling as a normal walking and then it actumatlly do the rest of the work.and to stop yourself and get recolocated it just need to be a little slower than you(at the beginning)", "comment_date": "2018-04-17T15:00:24Z", "likes_count": 2}, {"comment_by": "Hanyang Lee", "comment_text": "great", "comment_date": "2018-04-17T14:58:24Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Neo Geo", "comment_text": "Might be interesting to virtualize the CG point by finding center of the foot points", "comment_date": "2018-04-17T14:56:44Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Jared Fuller", "comment_text": "Destin, is George from Infinadeck accepting ME intern applicants?", "comment_date": "2018-04-17T14:55:10Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "The Tuna", "comment_text": "god i want this equipment", "comment_date": "2018-04-17T14:48:03Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "DasOschi", "comment_text": "<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fvu5FxKuqdQ&amp;t=6m43s\">6:43</a> was there a YouTube-Buddy on the desk? xD", "comment_date": "2018-04-17T14:46:57Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Avraham Kobliner", "comment_text": "their are a books in Hebrew?", "comment_date": "2018-04-17T14:45:52Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "stolen innocence", "comment_text": "Ready player one", "comment_date": "2018-04-17T14:35:57Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Lucas Propstmilik", "comment_text": "This is the real future of gaming.", "comment_date": "2018-04-17T14:33:58Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Jon Bonnell", "comment_text": "Run!

The first step you take was a good demonstration of that. If they were doing the calculations based on your feet, it wouldn\u2019t have moved the ground left as you were taking a step with your left foot. I would also remove the handlebar ring and use a motorized suspended harness that would help offset any changes in inertia while centering you while your body is low to the tread. The treadmill also shouldn\u2019t overshoot. If those are high action low response motors, they should be matching your stride and not moving you when you\u2019re not moving. They should correct your location slightly with the next stride, just like we do when we run on a normal treadmill. Here\u2019s a fun thought. Leaning forward and having the tread shoot your feet backwards while you eat the handrail. If your feet aren\u2019t moving, you\u2019re not intending to move. Even if one foot is moving, it\u2019s not enough for intent, you need to measure force. We don\u2019t walk like a pair of chop sticks falling from point to point.<br><br>Sorry for writing so much!

What if, instead of an exact point in space, they used a bubble for maintaining the user&#39;s CG in the center of the treadmill.  It may allow for damping of the accelerations/decelerations by not forcing the user onto a specific spot.  This may fix the back and forth that you experienced when you stopped abruptly.  It is similar to the sensitivity of joysticks on drones and other RC devices and video games.  The more precise sensitivity leads to jumpy controls versus the smoother movement that comes with lower sensitivity.  However, they would need to find a balance between increased and decreased sensitivity by modifying the size of the bubble to avoid excessive lag.  Perhaps a logarithmic or exponential algorithm would suffice in finding the balance.  Anyway, that&#39;s my idea!

The top of the ball would be flat (I suppose the bottom could be as well, so it&#39;d be like a toroid but no hole) . The underlayment of the ball would covered in ball bearings of some sort to allow the skin to move freely in any direction. Then there would be several motors-rollers that hold onto the skin and move it in any direction. This would help with inertia of the motors/belts that is evident in this device shown, and it would allow for true 360Deg movement without effecting the feet of the player. Even tho the tracks will move, they are still locked in 90Deg rotation of the main drive. I&#39;m sure this rotation can be felt. This also makes it harder for your brain to adapt to the new motion as it&#39;s quite unnatural in motion.<br>Perhaps if the computer was faster in the processing, or the programming was put in, it could sense your feet slowing down, there by slowing down the motor drives as well. It seemed like the guy explaining what was going on was basically saying it only monitors the back piece and tries to keep it centered. It would make more sense (albeit more computations need to be done) to use all 3 points (back and feet) to know where the person is on the treadmill. Your feet start to move in a particular direction before you back even begins to move. And same with slowing down.

I imagine the same could be said for the g forces in the moving floor; larger movements like running could be used to correct the position in the room while smaller movements like a step or two across the room wouldn&#39;t make the floor move if at all, to prevent feeling the g-forces.", "comment_date": "2018-04-16T20:17:03Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "dk57", "comment_text": "Whoa, where&#39;d you get the voltron tee?", "comment_date": "2018-04-16T20:16:55Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Geebs Kerbal", "comment_text": "From automatic doors to neck issues using tablets.

Feel like making the system far more simplified might help it accomplish it&#39;s problems. Rather than motors, give it sensors and brakes so that there is a friction limit. This is so that if you have your treadmill extremely slick, too slick to be stable you throw the brakes on till a certain amount of force given by the legs eases those brakes off. After that a couple of things could happen like pressure sensors to dictate length of stride etc and continuous brake release until it makes sense in the game to allow the human to run full pace. Feel like these guys need to imagine a redesign again and try to make the legs the input and not the positioning. Positioning would basically be used to control the avatars motion much as it normally is in VR but the treadmill should be responsible for the movement.

There&#39;s a lot of moving parts you need to get your brain to do at the same time to not look clumsy. <br><br>second level is when you have done it enough so you&#39;ve trained your body what to do in what circumstances and your muscle memory is such that you&#39;re no longer thinking &quot;ok, move the left foot forward no more than shoulder width forward to stay in balance, now pull the back foot up, staying in stance and shift your weight.&quot; Now you&#39;re thinking &quot;move forward&quot;.

We can accept delays and lags what we get from the paradox: &quot;it can&#39;t know what you are going to do&quot; which it always needs. Giving the user matching geometry between real life and VR and fully embracing the &quot;vehicle&quot; concept: it works. There isn&#39;t even motion sickness as such.
