It&#39;s different from a cat I think because the cat is all one structure whereas on the ship, the reaction wheel could be sped up and the ship could soon as long as you want along a given axis with no extra input until you want to stop.

This would allow you (to an extent of course) to change the microprocessors in your system, as better ways to do things are found.<br><br>Obviously this implies building something like a space telescope with the most generic control devices possible.
