All Tesla did was LITERALLY NOTHING, compared to what he could&#39;ve done. When you start reading and researching, you realize that Nikola was going to give us infinite, wireless and free energy all across the globe, with possibilities of audio and video communication, that would put the best smartphones to shame. He was actually working on it, when J.P. Morgan pulled the plug on his research funds, once he realized Tesla will make everything free. If he was allowed to do what he was going to do, he would propelled us straight into the 23rd century, within a decade.<br>Now just pause for a goddamn moment and imagine the scenario where Tesla was allowed to do what he was intending.

And this requires both the change in the collective consciousness but it also requires that there are certain scientists who are willing to question what most scientists are currently not questioning, including materialism. Now, just as a concrete example here, you have the whole concept of free energy. This can be explained actually in terms of what is currently known by quantum physics. You have observations made by quantum physicists in bubble chambers, that you can have a state where there are no particles, suddenly one particle appears, divides itself into several particles, they collide again and then disappear. There have been some scientists who have been willing to speculate that, beyond what can be observed even at the subatomic level, there must be some kind of energy field, some call it a quantum field, some call it a ground state, whatever they call it, but it has basically been proven by quantum physics, that there is some state beyond the physical material realm. And in that state there is energy. And that energy can then enter the material realm and become physical matter. If you take this and put it together with a big bang, you can see that, is it actually logical that all of the matter and all of the energy that is now in this huge universe was compressed into something called a singularity? Whatever that may be. Is this really logical? Obviously, all of the matchup could not fit in there. But could the energy actually fit into a single point? Is it not just as logical to say that there was an event where energy from a different realm entered the material frequency spectrum. And this means that all of the matter that you see in the world today is actually created from energy. This was proven by Einstein. And that energy must have come from somewhere, and what has now been proven for those who are willing to see it by quantum physics, is that that energy came from another realm. It entered the material world, the physical realm from another realm. Well, is that not free energy? Is it not thereby proven that the entire world is created by free energy? So does that not mean it is also possible that technology could be created, that would be able to, so to speak, channel the energy from a different realm into the material realm, where it could then be used to perform physical work or at least create electricity that could power machines that perform physical work. This is perfectly in line with what has already been discovered. See, what you have right now is, you have a state of technology, which is a reflection of the collective consciousness and the collective consciousness does not really fully accept the existence of another realm. That is why as we have said humankind has become a closed circle, a closed system subject to the second law of thermodynamics. That is why the technology you have today, the energy sources you have today, you think that the only way to provide energy is to either burn some kind of fuel, or split the atom, and free the energy that is already in the material realm. But this is simply a certain mindset that is based on an incomplete understanding of how the world works. As I said, quantum physics has already proven that the world is created by energy from another realm, and therefore, there is naturally much more energy in that realm and it is a matter of raising our view of the world, our understanding of the world, raising the collective consciousness until we can grasp what that other realm is like, and therefore be able to receive the technology that can make use of the energy that is there. It may be not so constructive to talk about free energy, but it is free in a sense that there is no cost, there is nothing that needs to be burned or consumed in the material realm in order to harness this energy and therefore, we might call it a different name and many different names could be suggested.", "comment_date": "2020-03-13T05:02:08Z", "likes_count": 2}, {"comment_by": "BluesupernovaGaming", "comment_text": "Holy Nicol\u00e1s tesla that&#39;s awesome", "comment_date": "2020-03-13T02:12:38Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "someone [idk who]", "comment_text": "Our body has a little molecule of electron not proton", "comment_date": "2020-03-12T23:51:38Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Joel Alexander", "comment_text": "Is that gun good for home defense?", "comment_date": "2020-03-12T22:38:58Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Plague Vamp", "comment_text": "SME Destin: And do the cats just walk around while you do this?<br>Mr. Prince: Well....<br>Destin: Ever baked a cat?!<br>Me: OMG LMFAO!!!", "comment_date": "2020-03-12T18:36:37Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "\u041c\u0430\u043a\u0441 \u0424.", "comment_text": "High frequency current don&#39;t really can going through your body.

The magician shows you something ordinary: a deck of cards, a bird or a man. He shows you this object. Perhaps he asks you to inspect it to see if it is indeed real, unaltered, normal. But of course... it probably isn&#39;t. The second act is called &quot;The Turn&quot;. The magician takes the ordinary something and makes it do something extraordinary.

The show was something like a demolition derby, only with very large (car and truck size) heavy duty robots (and explosions and fire).  They had a very large Tesla coil they ran as part of the show.  One participant was planning to wear a faraday suit, and walk under the coil to draw sparks.  I finished my project and left to get dinner before the show, as our human lightning rod was assembling his suit.  It had a bird cage for a helmet, and a combination of foil and sheet metal parts.  When I came back he was gone, and did not appear in the show.  However robots did drive under the coil head (it was about 25&#39; tall and threw massive arcs).  When robots drove under it, they typically lasted a few seconds up to 1 or 2 minutes before their electronics became fried, and if they had rubber tires, the arc would pass over the tires and set them on fire.  The point being that you might be able to touch a arc from a small coil, but the large ones can start fires and do damage to a person.  I speculate the lightning rod boy tested his suit before the show, and found his suit part-to-part coupling was insufficient, and he was probably tasered to the ground as soon as he was struck.  It was an impressive coil, but it was so devastating to the robots that it didn&#39;t really spend much time on during the show...  Not to mention it was extremely loud, and self-destructive if run too long.  So just because you can touch the arc from small coils, don&#39;t think that you can do it for larger ones.  I&#39;m pretty sure that  the one at the show was potentially deadly.  I don&#39;t know how much current it takes to produce the heat required to set a  small car tire on fire,  but I&#39;m pretty sure it&#39;s enough to burn your finger off, and stop your heart too.<br><br><br>When you are close to one of the big ones, the big zzzappp sounds are quite startling.  But when people are /trying/ to destroy things, things get out of hand easily.  One robot had a 2&#39; diameter sonic canon fueled with oxy-acetylene, and they used it to shoot at targets in the show&#39;s field...  At one point the driver of the robot pointed it at the stands and sent some people to the emergency room with punctured ear drums...  The show was stopped by the police early, and the show&#39;s organizers were banned from the state of Texas... and a great time was had by the survivors.<br><br><br>I guess you aren&#39;t conducting good survival research if everyone survives...", "comment_date": "2019-10-14T08:45:06Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Charls Moses R.M.", "comment_text": "Hi there is there somebody can tell me the name of the first song sound??

The penetration depth of an electrical current is based on the frequency due to the &#39;skin effect.&#39; A DC current can pass directly through the body and the heart allowing it to easily be deadly. However, in the case of AC current the current density decreases with increasing depth below the surface and the higher the frequency the greater the effect. As Tesla coils use very high frequencies, the current density is exponentially decreasing under your skin quickly. As a result, it is unlikely that the current will pass through your heart for small currents like those created by the Tesla coils featured here.

But we all learned R=U/I in school, so I must be U/R. You have some body resistance which doesn&#39;t change too much (I don&#39;t know the value right now, but something around that 200 V can produce a deadly current) and the voltage across your body must be at least a few thousand volts when you&#39;re touching an arc that travels tens of inches through the air.\u00a0<br>So therefore there should be a higher current passing through your body than microamps.\u00a0<br>Am I getting sth wrong here? My theory is that through the pulsed nature of the arcs the high current of some amps just lasts for some microseconds and that the harm is something like I/t and the effect is the same as a few microamps of constant current...<br>Would love to har some answers,<br>Thomas<br>PS.

I will show you something truly amazing. Ahh what the heck, on the actual Tesla coils out there the wiring as well as the dome are all circular in nature. From spark gap to a circular coil as in figure drawing shown at <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_fTC_Ud_k3U&amp;t=1m16s\">1:16</a> in the video. Ok now imagine the &quot;coils&quot; in other geometric shapes. Try that in a few different shapes and see what you get. The lightning bolts CAN be controlled. With a circular coil and other circular parts in the system the lightning is more erratic and less stable. I have no videos of this proof at this time, but i encourage you to try different set ups to see what the differences are that i speak of. <br><br>Tesla invented many many innovations we use to this day. Two of the biggest would be WIFI and the incandescent bulbs. The thing about the two is Tesla never wrote or linked the two together that we are aware of other than in house testing in his lab, but he did state that his inventions would not need the use of modern known power lines and transformers. He was also a master in terms of radio waves and understanding them. His idea was to send power via radio waves (see HAARP antenna array) and some even believe it can control the weather or disrupt it in some way. Personally after almost 20 years of studying Tesla and this type of science i have come to find that Tesla kept some things to himself after the debacles with Eddison. I am sure that there are things he never documented just fr the sole purpose of it falling into the wrong hands.", "comment_date": "2017-02-02T15:09:57Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "simon clarke", "comment_text": "bat bot", "comment_date": "2017-02-02T14:53:33Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "HELL CRIMINAL", "comment_text": "U should built like a a gun <br>Which shoot bolts of plasma", "comment_date": "2017-02-02T14:18:14Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Pospicles", "comment_text": "Why the dislikes???????????

So I cringed seeing you let this thing zap you - I wouldn&#39;t have the nerve, despite knowing the current was low.   Hopefully, no-one is naive enough to THINK they can do the same with high voltage power lines or low - medium voltage industrial or domestic supply - But I&#39;ve seen so many idiots treating it as casually as changing torch batteries - unafraid - unafraid because they don;t know how close they are to having molton metal explode in their face in a three phase flash-over.    A few educational videos of sub-stations exploding when people operate the huge breakers (the oil cooled/ quenching kind) too slowly would be interesting to see again and a reminder of the unseen power in those thin &quot;wires&quot;.   It&#39;s HARD not equating huge arcs with danger - It&#39;s HARD to accept that most electrocution deaths are unspectacular, people just slump to the ground when as little as 50mA stops their heart.

Awesome great shout out to some awesome web pages as well. Going to buy a soldering iron right now! lol Also I have been a fan of your videos for some time now and am still stoked about all the ISS and Astronaut videos, but as of today I just became a Patreon and am glad to support videos and experiences like this. I absolutely cannot wait till my Toddler(with a capitol T) can appreciate Science like this! I never had the opportunity growing up in a poor farming and ranching community Science was not a major focus for my parents and I have since, as an adult, nurtured that bug. I mean what child wants to be a Paleontologist at the age of 8. But sadly a life of Science was not in the cards for me or the ability to pay for college. So now I have been in the US Army for 15 years almost ready to retire and the next chapter in my life. I would absolutely love to be able to do something or video something with you some day. I know you get that a million times a day. But I really mean it, you are getting some great info out there and you look like you are enjoying life as it happens. I want to teach my child that geeky happiness like I was not!

Just wanted to comment on the nature of the current in the sparks for those interested, as the details are often misrepresented or completely wrong.  First of all, the spark current is quite significant, approximately 3-4 amperes peak (yes amps, not milli or micro amps), with a duration of some 10&#39;s of milliseconds depending on the settings of the machine.  The reasons that it does not cause any noticeable harm is 2 fold:  the frequency of the current is around 420kHz, and the discharge has a relatively low charge available by design.  The high frequency phenomena is analogous to not being able to hear sounds above a certain frequency because it&#39;s too fast for our nervous system to &quot;respond&quot; to.  However, anyone who has touched the sparks of a large Tesla coil will know that it still packs a nasty punch, and the reason for this is that the initial connection delivers a significant amount of charge (volts * capacitance) which you <b>will</b> feel.  This type of Tesla coil works at a relatively low voltage of 70kV and uses a relatively small self capacitance (the silver donut &quot;toroid&quot; makes up this capacitance mostly) of just 15pF.  It&#39;s the initial discharge of the 70kV*15pF = 1uC that can cause a &quot;shock&quot; sensation (which is on the order of a static zap of 10kV at 100pF of body capacitance), but the follow through current of 3-4 amps does not cause nerve stimulation (consider an electrocauterization machine that works with similar currents and frequencies, and does not shock the patient).  The danger of radio-frequency burns is still significant, however, and there is a nerve response to the intense heating produced where the spark connects to your skin!", "comment_date": "2016-12-02T18:52:55Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Tyler Whieler", "comment_text": "i guess if u rob a bank with that thing people will think they burn to ash instandly", "comment_date": "2016-12-02T18:50:00Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "TheCaptain", "comment_text": "You looked like you had a ton of fun!

First of all, thank you SO much for the videos you put up for us. They are fun and informative and I have learned a great deal from them.  I&#39;m sure a lot of others have, too.  <br><br>Second, after watching this video I felt I just had to comment. I have always thought you were one of the coolest Youtubers out there, and this video proved it.  You are highly intelligent and funny and your videos are always upbeat and you have tons of energy, and it&#39;s easy to get caught up in your enthusiasm for the topic of each video. I think this is my new favorite on the list of your vids (previously it was the one on Prince Rupert drops, because.... c&#39;mon, I mean - it&#39;s about PRINCE RUPERT DROPS and has high speed footage of them shattering!!!). When you became incredulous and overexcited and laughing like a little kid, it was kind of infectious.  I began laughing, too.  It was so cool to see you get your geek on and to see the wonder and excitement in your eyes build from the beginning of the video, and when you got to shoot the Tesla Gun, you seemed like a little boy that just found out magic was real.  When I got to the end, I immediately watched the whole video again, laughing the whole time.  It was wonderful.  It does the heart good to see one of the cool kids let his inner nerd bubble over.  You are a marvel, Sir, and one can easily see why you became a scientist.  The Ol&#39; Blister (my pet name for the love of my life - she calls me The Curmudgeon) is already asleep, but I can&#39;t wait to show her the video in the morning.  Keep up the good work, Sir.
