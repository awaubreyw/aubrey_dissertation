[{"comment_by": "SmarterEveryDay", "comment_text": "Thank you for taking the time to watch the video. This is video 1 of a 3 part series on Social Media Algorithm manipulation and countermeasures.  Even if you&#39;re aware of these issues, odds are your friends and parents are not.  I&#39;m hoping we can use this video series to educate an incredible amount of people about the realities of algorithmic manipulation online.  The engineers tasked with working on these problems take their jobs very seriously and they are truly the unsung heroes in this fight.  I&#39;d be honored if you shared this video with someone you love.  <br><br><br>I&#39;m on Twitter at: <a href=\"https://twitter.com/smartereveryday\">https://twitter.com/smartereveryday</a><br>You can subscribe here for the rest of the series (in process): <a href=\"http://bit.ly/Subscribe2SED\">http://bit.ly/Subscribe2SED</a> <br><br><br><br>Note: This is a completely apolitical video.  I don&#39;t care what side of the aisle you&#39;re on, you&#39;re a target of these types of attacks.  I&#39;d like to say thank you to everyone at these three companies (and those beyond) willing to discuss this very sensitive topic, and giving me your trust.  This touches many different areas.... technical engineering, human interactions,  artificial intelligence, IT, financial incentives, law enforcement, attempts to manipulate others, etc.  This is an absolutely fascinating topic and I believe it&#39;s imperative that we talk about these issues more openly so even the most lackadaisical social media user is aware of them.  I have realized lately that in general, people online are very eager to become angry at these platforms whenever there is the slightest misstep, without truly understanding the impossible engineering tasks these individuals have been given.<br><br><br>I&#39;d like to thank Ren\u00e9e Diresta for taking the time to discuss these issues openly with me.  She wrote a wonderful piece called the &quot;Digital Maginot Line&quot; (<a href=\"https://www.ribbonfarm.com/2018/11/28/the-digital-maginot-line/)\">https://www.ribbonfarm.com/2018/11/28/the-digital-maginot-line/)</a>.  For those unfamiliar, the maginot line was an amazing undertaking to create a defensive front, which was easily sidestepped.   It&#39;s worth your time.", "comment_date": "2019-03-31T18:16:03Z", "likes_count": 4773}, {"comment_by": "Peter Boyle's", "comment_text": "Maga s at work", "comment_date": "2022-09-03T23:26:25Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Sigmund", "comment_text": "12 /", "comment_date": "2022-08-26T22:54:11Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "ramly asuki", "comment_text": "very nice", "comment_date": "2022-08-09T21:39:29Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Moutaz Abd Elwahaab", "comment_text": "WTF", "comment_date": "2022-08-08T23:32:11Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Brandon Garner", "comment_text": "What if its not a foreign nation?

That&#39;s where this platform is really lacking. They seem to put the emphasis on pure #&#39;s, not on reality of those numbers..and selling their ads, as the end result, which is a shame. With more and more and more (did i say &quot;more&quot; enough!?) content continously being uploaded, and no doubt more of it being robot or ai created, this is no doubt a large challenge on this platform, and other similiar platforms. Let&#39;s get back to basics, put people more in the loop where they&#39;re needed, and get those trying to put out great stuff rewarded properly for their time. Not much to ask of a corporation that grosses $20,000,000,000/year. Spend more on real people to fix the problems.

The developers at YouTube are not trying to combat the misinformation that comes through them.

They&#39;ve changed to pay based on these factors so that people are incentivized to put out false political videos to manipulate the political views of a certain group of people. Because we both know that  people want drama naturally.  So they comment and then someone comments back with a rebuttal and so on and so fourth. Which brings more money to the content creator.  Then people share said video across other social media platforms. Which causes people to have a false perception of someone or a particular political party. Hence why comments pay the most.

We have allowed these cultural Usurious Elites to gain control of YT / Goog / FB / Amazon, who then subsequently encourage a) Piracy for (their network) Profits, b) gaming elections c) suppressing any dissenters against their UWO (Usury World Order) such as banning Trump from Twitter / FB, or banning any of us who dare speak out against their UWO (such as Parler) or against their Book (which commands them to destroy Christianity since it was authored around 200-400 A.D.).  You cannot just &quot;blame China&quot; as if it is foreign Governments who are gaming YT.  It is YT ITSELF who are gaming the world towards despotism, as seen by their early History as a flagrant Pirate site.  So how is it that you can claim to be &quot;scientific&quot; yet apolitical (as if Science itself isn&#39;t politicized, like the fake global warming cabal, IPCC, NOAA, even NASA in on it).  When I was Civ Servant, I too was ignorant of this, gung-ho as well.  But ask yourself, who owns McDonnel-Douglas, Boeing et al?  You will see in the top two slots, Blackstone Capital, Vanguard Fund, et al.  Try to trace their quasi-politico-theological lineage, and you will see staring right at you in the face, &quot;Faith Alone&quot;  and Usury Hegemony, the Ultimate Discord + Genocide forces for at least 1600 yrs.<br>.<br>So for this, you need to take a long break from &quot;Engineering-only&quot; studies, and spend a long time on History-Theology studies.  Time for a wake-up-call my friend.  You&#39;ll find no better and complete intro to the History of Usury, than Dr. E Michael Jones&#39; &#39;Barren Metal&#39; (over 1500 pgs!).  Guess what?  He too has had his other books banned from YT &amp; Amazon, merely because he tells the Truth that They denied you in schools.  The right thing to do is to educate the public on this sordid History, and to use their own Algorithms to game such content to the top of eyeballs.  Then you will see the public start to demand Truth.

My working theory is: it is all about search engine ranking. When one picks an asteroid making an &quot;unimpressive&quot; Earth close approach, no one else is writing about it, making the top-ranking essay.   I am an amateur astronomer who specializes in asteroids, and sometimes I am called on to do clean-up for people with &quot;astrophobia&quot;  after they read one of the clickbait stories.

The last two observations had high residuals(aka they were poor). 2018 SV13 was posted as a 1 in 3.6 million risks to the NEODyS: Risk page (ESA&#39;s Risk List). However, it was not posted to the Sentry: Earth Impact Monitoring Page(NASA JPL).  It was reported in clickbait media outlets this asteroid &#39;Non-Zero&#39; Probability Of Hitting Earth. There was a fail attempt to find precovery observations on archival images.

The hot topic of division these days is politics.. and of course religion.. (but not so much these says).. but if the world became politically harmonized.. it would be other subjects..

Well, computers are never going to be able to catch other computers.. the algorithms on each side will just get better.. the war never ends and offense will always have the advantage of first strike.

There is no reason to think that they are not politically biased too.  <br><br>That leads me to the ever difficult question, what is really objective?  What is unbiased?   It is hard to determine.  <br><br>As the woman in the video say, the country is polarized.   The western world is polarized.  <br><br>Most of the media IS on the left side of the politics.    That could be interpreted as the right-wing medias are NOT in line, they are producing fake news etc.   Is that so?  I&#39;m not going to come to a conclusion on this, because I&#39;m not trying to convince anyone that one thing is more right than the other. (Even though I do think so)  <br><br>Now, there is another approach to this.   Approximately half the people is on Trump&#39;s side.  Half of it rallying against him.    That is certainly not represented by the media, so who determines what is really correct?   What is really the objective truth when you have to parties both claiming they have the truth?  <br><br>It can not be both of them, obviously, so who is it?  I would advocate that the people is almost by definition more correct than the media, but they can be misled.  Very misled as we have seen through history. (the irony is that they were misled by media)   On the other hand, journalists are not known to be representative for the people as they lean way more left than the average Joe.    Facebook and Google is not very different here either.  They have come down quite hard on what they consider to be fake news, but is it fake just because they THINK it is wrong?  Also, some mediaowners like Jeff Bezos openly against the other party and can not in any way be considered objective, and TV-channels like CNN are also known to be very biased.   certainly, you can observe that with some shows at Fox too, and certainly with Breitbart.  However. Being biased is not equal not to tell the truth.   The truth can be told in a favorable way, or, it can be that even though it is portrayed favorable for Trump in Fox, that it actually IS favorable.  The economy, as an example.  That would be played down by opposing media, which thus can be biased by omitting favorable.  <br><br>That goes all the way in to the institutions of a nation or the world.  Many are living off goverment funding for research projects, and if the politicians get the wrong answer, they may cut the funding.  It is really hard to know who to believe under such circumstances, and it really demands a lot of attention to connects the dots and see what creates a sensible picture and what doesn&#39;t.  So far, I can not see that the way Facebook and Google go about it with their censorship is really of any use if you want to sort out fake news.   They are definitely a political actor too, trying to influence the politics in a way that benefits their business.

From a technical perspective the techniques and tactics used to discover and exploit flaws in the algorithms are frankly old hat to security experts like myself thus why many of us regard such as a novel form of malware joining the ranks of viruses and trojans (Though these are of course often used to steal the computing resources to generate such content also). For me and many I have talked to in my field the most worrying aspect of the latest trend is just how rapidly the offensive side is progressing thanks to the existing black hat community having so many transferable skills to break into this new market as this is massively outpacing defensive efforts such as user education that could potentially limit the damage. For many other forms of malware user education has finally managed to help turn the tide of the battle in favour of the defenders as users are for the most part highly suspicious of random links from strangers or other suspect activity but user education of the risks when it comes to this new wave of attacks feels like it is decades behind the curve thanks to the wealth of experience on the attackers side. Granted there has been similar dark ages so to speak with other forms of malware in the past where education lagged far behind the inattentiveness of attackers but this hasn&#39;t really been a major thing in the end user space for decades and back then the internet didn&#39;t have the reach it does now, these days we need to educate literally every member of society in order to catch up and that is a tall order.", "comment_date": "2019-08-16T00:32:34Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Caue Villamaina Silva", "comment_text": "IF YOU\u2019RE NOT ALL HAPPY ABOUT THIS VIDEO, THIS IS A MUST READ - I\u2019m sorry to disagree, from <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1PGm8LslEb4&amp;t=0m00s\">0:00</a> to <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1PGm8LslEb4&amp;t=3m40s\">3:40</a> it\u2019s all about images.

You may look into Cambridge Analytica and the use of the OCEAN microtargeting model, that combines sentiment analysis and IA learning how to trigger people&#39;s reactions to favor a political view. For instance, Cambridge Analytica operated in my country (Argentina) along with the ONG &quot;Argentinian Task Force&quot; funded by vulture funds to revert the public opinion on paying them billions of dollars, succeeding to overthrown a Government that back then had managed to engage the OAS into start to regulate sovereign debt claims, replaced by another one whose first measure was to commit to pay them up to the last penny while taking new loans on terms that favors future vulture funds claims.<br><br>This isn&#39;t new: in the past decade similar techniques were applied for the same goals, just involving a lot of human resources making and analyzing surveys instead of an IA, while adjusting the storytelling to different media outlet based on where and how they intersect with each other to influence public opinion. BTW, I&#39;ve been working with scoring systems and IA applied to the credit markets, I was connected by people doing this to help them solve some local issues that interfered with their goals, but they show me the tech involved and examples of success from Mexico.<br> <br>I believe current polarization isn&#39;t a coincidence, in an increasing number of places elections are won by splitting hairs and it&#39;s reasonable to believe there are several organizations offering technologies (that are patented and that were published in papers) hired to compete against each other.

I followed a cooking page for years and then all of a sudden it stopped posting cooking videos and just focused out of the blue on politics everyone at first thought it was hacked but after months of it going on and the creator not reclaiming his page it became clear the page was sold but they kept the same cooking title to keep its followers  and every now and then it would even post a stolen cooking video that they obviously didnt make.  Seen a DIY page do the same thing as well and this is going on with Facebook I wouldn&#39;t be surprised if it was happening with YouTube, Twitter and Instagram etc as well.

And tons of people shared and commented how bad that was and how they should be taken down a peg and shut down etc. I was about to share but then I thought and looked them up I found no videos online I also found no reviews on any site (I know they&#39;re new but if they had the monster of all worst experiences you&#39;d thing someone would have at least tweeted it.) No one other then this poster showed up in any of the searches I did and the only reviews were from a completely different location which had mostly good reviews anyway. so I commented this saying we should share until we get proof and I had nothing but people calling me stupid and an idiot for doing the research and stain there&#39;s no proof. All the responses I got were from cherry picked reviews from the wrong location and more people claiming things they couldn&#39;t prove like the company deleting negative reviews online (but if there was evidence which came first the girl claiming wrong doing or the company deleting bad reviews people could have been so pationate about the post that a few of them could have been doxing  the company with bad reviews.)

There is something intuitively wrong about them, regardless of how good they can get with robot voices.  As far as ad revenue goes, everyone I&#39;ve talked to so far agrees with:  Adpocalypse is completely stupid.  The concept that someone is going to search for a video that offends them, then watch the ad and not buy that product is completely ludicrous.  Everyone hates ads.  I hate ads to the point that, when I am watching a video, I curse the company for interrupting my video.  Period.  I haven&#39;t watched programmed television in over 20 years because of the commercials.  If I want a product, I will look for companies who offer it when I want to.  When I sit down to watch a video.. the last thing that I want to see is an ad.  And I watch and search for videos that I want to watch, not that offend me.  Literally everyone hates ads and the first thing that they do is get ad-blocker.  I heard so many times my friends screaming, &quot;What the f&amp;$*!!!!  Never EVER AM I GOING TO BUY A (enter product here), for interrupting my video!!&quot;  So this whole &quot;not-ad-friendly&quot; video concept is complete nonsense.  Everyone sees ads, especially that cut from the video to some message..  as rude, unprofessional, disgusting, and they hate it.  For example, I&#39;ve never seen an ad for most products that I buy and companies that I like, and they do not need ads because they are that good..  and there is no funds that they waste trying to make ads.  In fact, if a company CEO came out and said, &quot;We&#39;ve never run ad, in fact, we don&#39;t even have an advertisement department..&quot;  I would purchase that product, no matter what it is, just out of pure joy.", "comment_date": "2019-05-10T21:55:08Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Lou H", "comment_text": "yeah bad guys will use you for money purpose ..btw do you know express vpn ? hahah", "comment_date": "2019-05-10T21:18:55Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Harmony Force", "comment_text": "Blockchain tech will help here it will just take some time before we get there.", "comment_date": "2019-05-10T18:04:20Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Tom Andy Stripe", "comment_text": "America has no Left just Two Right Wings..", "comment_date": "2019-05-10T16:55:17Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Spec Tacular", "comment_text": "big pile of social engineering and no amount of warnings or eye opening videos are going to help it, people are naturally tribalistic in nature and this nature is what is being taken advantage of, look more into human psychology to understand why.", "comment_date": "2019-05-10T16:22:12Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Raymond Wood", "comment_text": "Still don&#39;t understand how you could down vote this guy&#39;s videos!", "comment_date": "2019-05-10T15:50:47Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Nesta Grover", "comment_text": "VPN&#39;s are not full proof.

However, I don&#39;t like the flimsy defense offered for YouTube. Yes, it&#39;s correct that the people exploiting the algorithms are the ones doing the most wrong thing, but YouTube has created a platform that it is clearly incapable of securing properly. They definitely deserve blame for that. They are far from an innocent party in this. Sloppy example, but bear with me:<br><br>Imagine your local flea market was in the news because there was a booth that got caught selling child pornography. Oops, they shut it down. It wasn&#39;t their fault. It was just that their algorithm for approving vendors missed that one. Then next week another one pops up. And then another. And another, and another, and so forth. Eventually the flea market can&#39;t just pretend they have nothing to do with it. They are not defenseless if their business model is routinely &#39;hacked&#39; in order to distribute that. We&#39;d all be calling for that flea market to be shutdown. <br><br>Now, this video tries to put forth that this algorithm stuff is difficult. And our smartest people are working on it. YouTube is trying its hardest. How else are we supposed to get this algorithm working right? His blind spot here is that he&#39;s a software engineer. Maybe the fact that we are expecting an algorithm to do this is the exact problem to begin with. If the algorithm can&#39;t be trusted and puts our political system at risk, then that algorithm should be shut down asap. We&#39;ve seen Facebook mnaipulated to effectively lead to a genocide of Muslim people in Myanmar. These algorithms have very real consequences in the world.

Not smarter every day. The quality of this video is pretty poor but I am not talking about production quality. Content is more important than production quality. This is not some conspiracy and there is nothing wrong with it, this is a legitimate way to earn income on Youtube. There are instructionals for how anyone can do this and there are so many because plenty of people are realising this is how you can easily make money. The videos are quick to make and there is an audience for these videos. You are literally providing content people want to see and there is nothing wrong with that. I watch videos produced this way all the time. I&#39;m not personally into the extreme politics or conspiracies. When I want to learn something, if I am researching, I will find many low quality computer voice videos made with these services that contain quality information. Despite the low quality this is the superior way to consume content because I can listen to it and I can turn the speed up and consume the information faster than I can read. I learn more in a shorter period. But your video is worse, because your video is some weird conspiracy video that is way off the mark and stretching to try and find the craziest conclusion when this whole thing is a very simple concept and not a conspiracy at all. The difference is you put lots of effort in trying to make a quality video not realising the quality of content is more important. Now people will make conspiracy videos and videos with extreme political views because there is an audience for that material. The reason you see so many similar videos is because they all use the same reference material. A known way to churn out videos is to have a computer voice read or even read yourself articles that someone else has written. There will be cases of copyright infringement but  there are even services for this part, content you can use and reproduce legally, for a fee. It&#39;s a win/win. Consumers are getting content they searched for and want to watch. People are making money churning out this content, services are being made to create these videos, people are writing this content and also earning. The only issue is people who are getting butt hurt over content they don&#39;t agree with or over the fact that people choose to watch low quality videos when they have put so much effort into the production quality of their videos.", "comment_date": "2019-04-11T10:18:24Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Richie B", "comment_text": "Lmao how far will snowflakes go", "comment_date": "2019-04-11T10:07:14Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Xerathiel vi Darquise", "comment_text": "tl;dr Ya&#39;ll need a lil bit of Jesus", "comment_date": "2019-04-11T09:18:38Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Anders Carlsson", "comment_text": "Diresta?

Things should succeed because they are naturally better, with more care put into them and care for those who will be receiving said product. But as it is, by and large, whoever has the largest advertising budget wins, and it just becomes a vicious, self-perpetuating cycle.<br><br>Of course, the actual problem is our nature as people and the nature of the society we&#39;ve built for ourselves... ...I say we, but in truth, society was always more or less constructed by a handful of individuals across each era anyway.<br>Any effort to ever stop such a twisted practice and even so much as an attempt to create a better system is just going to be stomped out of sight by those with power, money, and influence who benefit from the system. ...I mean, think about just how much control Google and the like have over the online world. Trying to usurp them as a genuine competitor is almost impossible, let alone somebody trying to collapse the very system they benefit so much off of.<br>It&#39;s... something that needs to be done away with, but it&#39;s something I don&#39;t think the best of us actually know how to do, or what we&#39;d do if we got there. Even if we did know, people are too easily influenced, and people in power won&#39;t give up the power that keeps them in power in the first place. ...Well, really, that&#39;s been a problem with human society for about as long as it&#39;s existed.<br><br><br>We as a species need to grow past the shoddy old society that we&#39;ve dragged along with us for thousands of years already. ...Because if we don&#39;t, in this day and age, our very world genuinely depends on it.

Then say Video B contains 80% of video A,  and say 80% of C,  D,  and E.   Well then you&#39;re on to them and can issue a flag.<br><br>basically they need to create a series of detection algorithms that form an A.I.  which is able to detect identical video content using the same elements we as human beings use to detect identical video content.  <br><br>so what&#39;s the first thing people use to I.D.  redundant video content??<br>well first the visuals.  90% of information taken in by humans is through the eyes right??<br>so first we use,  like you said,  pixel detection.  Then we search for graphics that match other graphics.  Here&#39;s how we do pixel detection the right way to prevent people form using filters.<br>save video A is has a section,  in this section there&#39;s a series of pixels.  These pixels all have hex values or byte values.  let&#39;s do bytes since that&#39;s easier.  say pixel A is Red 128,  green 0,  and Blue 255.  this equals purple.  -But let&#39;s scammer B dims the screen a bit so the colors don&#39;t match to dodge the system.  well our specific shade of purple is going to go up or down by a specific margin.  so legit purple becomes scammer purple ----&gt;  100 0 227 cuz he subtracted 28bits from each channel.  <br><br>now let&#39;s say next to purple was a specific green.  represented by byte order 0,  255,  0.  and we notice that green in video A has become 0,  227, 0  in video B,  and we notoce the neighboring pixel blue,  has gone from 0,0,255,  becomes 0,0,227.  well then we got a pattern.  every pixel in video has been lowered by 28bits but the order and arrangement are identical.  bam we cought someone using a filter.  easy stuff.<br><br>so we need something that can detect the use of color filters,  because all color filters are algorithms and all alogrithms can be reversed,  and leave behind numeric identical patterns against the original content.  making sense??<br><br>next we need to check for mirror imaging.  say video A has a pick of trump,  and video B has a pic of the president mirrored.  when we scan video B,  we can check for that same image everywhere on the platform,  then run comparisons in flipped,  reverse/backwards,  invert/upside,  or mirrored.  one of them will match.  -and if an object is mirrored will find the same group of pixels in reverse order on the opposite of the infringing video.  again easy stuff.<br><br>now let&#39;s talk about where the rest of the info comes from,  our ears and speech centers.  <br>in Video A we have a dialogue:  &quot;The president colluded with russians to win the election,  and topple leading candidates for the presidency of the united states.  The president called on the russians for financial backing,  and they answered.&quot;  <br>Now lets say Video B has the same exact dialogue we detected using speech recognition converted to typed word.  same way cell phones convert your speech to search quires.  <br>So video B contains 100% of Video A&#39;s dialogue.  Bam we flag it.<br>But let&#39;s say Video C rearranges the order of dialogue and says,  &quot;The president called on the russians for financial backing,  and they answered.  The president colluded with russians to win the election,  and topple leading candidates for the presidency of the united states.&quot;  <br>Since the order of dialgue is different,  but says the same things,  we as people can detect that cp infrignement,  but the machiens can&#39;t right??<br>Well sophisticated speech recognition with sophisticated speech to text conversion can still figure it out.  It detect that String B,  &quot;The president called on the russians for financial backing,  and they answered.&quot;  is still present in Video B.  Some script languages have this capability built in for chat rooms,  and i code with them all the time.<br><br>I say if ($stringA isin $stringB) {  -we have a match }  <br><br>it&#39;s very simple,  basic,  and very fast code.  <br><br>All we have to do to beat these scum bags,  is use the heuristics and methods that humans use to detect duplicate content,  and group them instead of trying to use basic things like pixel detection.  <br>Humans don&#39;t detect matching pixels,  we detect matching groups.  and we don&#39;t detect exact colors down to the byte,  we detect color similarities based on ranges of approximations.  for example my<br>aforementioned color detection algorithm.<br><br>1)  so first we use our stolen or song recognition software to make sure the audio isn&#39;t identical.  Since that&#39;s super fast and easy.<br>2)  Then we run the video through the visual detection system using all our pixel,  image,  color,  and filter detection algorithms which can detect identical color ranges,  not just single colors,  it can detect flipped mirrored reversed inverted upside or re-arranged graphics between 2 different videos.<br>3)  Then we run it through our patented Speech Center detection algorithm,  and this works on dialgue and typed word matches.  now let&#39;s say Video A is spoken,  and video B is captions.  How do we detect that??  Simple.  we create an entire text file containing all the spoken dialogue converted to text,  and all the written word contained in captions and such from both videos.  Then we can compare the 2 text files from video A and Video B and see that Video B is made up of the same exact dialogue in Video A,  regardless of whether it was spoken by a human reading a script,  a robot,  or written in captions.  <br>4)  We score the the video on each group of algorithms,  say it was 0% audio match,  50% video contect match,  100% dialogue match.  if any group exceeds 50% we can call a flag for investigation by human eyes.  or we can take all the groups and average them together to create a threshold.  0 + 50 + 100 = 150 / 3 = %50 match or identical to video A,  so we can it a flag or investigation by human eyes.<br>5)  Then for each group we create a percentage match threshold and categorize them.  We&#39;ll says.....100% match by algorithm group is - infringement,  redundant,  propaganda,  or scam.  <br>80% is copy right dodging and possibly group A,  50-80% is a peer review of content or product,  20%-50%  is a citation or quoting source,  and 0-20% is margin of error,  or coincidence simply just mentioning something else.  <br><br>That way if the video scores too high in any single math group we can flag it,  and if it scores to high in the combined group average we can flag,  but if it scores too low in any single group,  or in the group average we can id the video as a review,  a citation,  or a mention,  and not waste further resources on analysis so we can move on to the next video.<br><br>look im nobody really,  but this isn&#39;t a hard task to do.  the real work is just writing the code to do it,  but all we gotta do is create a series of algorithms that can judge videos based on the merits humans do to detect redundancy and similarity.  I believe my method will not only protect us against these scammers,  and click farms,  but also protect artists and youtubers from false copyright flags.  to where they dont&#39; get shut down just for saying stupid like &quot;im drinking a coca-cola,  or i was watching Teen Titans Go,  the other day.&quot;<br><br>-And at the same time,  we wont&#39; have to see 10000&#39;s of videos of rehashed content.  <br>Since im just a basic Youtube user,  google,  facebook,  and twitter would never listen to me.  -But if you take this comment and send it as a letter or notice to youtube and companies,  They&#39;ll listen to you before they listen to me.  so please send this to the higher ups.  maybe with your cred they will read this,  and since im a software engineer myself and a scientist,  these guys will know exactly what i&#39;m talking about.  The sooner we get more heads in on this,  the sooner we can fix our broken youtube,  and squash the people exploiting it for money,  and making it impossible for legit youtubers to get payed.  I don&#39;t monetize my content ever,  but I don&#39;t think it&#39;s fair that all these people who rely on the youtube/attention economy to survive should be getting screwed by scammers,  and hate mongers.  If anyone were to contact me regarding the matter i could write a much clearer,  and detailed,  thorough dissertation with better well written formulas to execute my method,  so i&#39;m here if anyone wants to talk to me about it.  I don&#39;t expect anything in return for my assistance,  but if it happens that someone wants to rewards my talents i&#39;m okay with that too.  I just wanna see this garbage come to an end already before youtube crashes under the weight of it&#39;s own burden.<br><br>Youtube is in serious danger these days,  with their censorship of free speech and constitutional amendments(lilke the attack on 2nd amendment videos),  and just the sheer mass of scammers trying to exploit it for financial gain with doing little to no work of their own,  and producing original content which was the founding basis of youtube-so much so-people have started migrating to other video websites for both better content viewing,  and greater freedom in content creation for both the enthusiast and the working social video entrepreneur.  Patreon,  Bittube,  Bitchute,  DailyMotion,  Veoh,  are gaining people who are migrating in mass to other video sites searching for both freedom of speech,  and fair recognition for their hardwork.  -At this rate,  Youtube,  and much of google is poised to be replaced by the next big hit.  Same with facebook.  If you love the youtube platform,  and we gotta pitch in equal efforts to crack down on exploitation,  and unfair practices.", "comment_date": "2019-04-09T19:16:23Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Ivandro Jao", "comment_text": "how fun would it be if the same game take this video and make a copy and upload it and add the robot voice", "comment_date": "2019-04-09T19:08:18Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "firehawk895", "comment_text": "And I thought he was a physics guy.

The major difference is that bots can produce a lot more content, a lot faster, and drown out well-researched, high-quality journalism.<br><br>The blunt solution is just to derank everyone who isn&#39;t a &quot;trusted&quot; source, but that&#39;s a problem, too. It&#39;s not as though MSNBC and CNN don&#39;t have their own issues, they&#39;re just more sophisticated about their false reporting. There&#39;s native advertising, which typically looks exactly like newscopy, but is actually promotional material from a company and may be attempting to misinform the public over some issue relevant to the company&#39;s bottom line (the Gates foundation uses native ads extensively, as does the oil industry), and in any case does not follow the same editorial standards as the publication-proper. There&#39;s also the rare instances where a government may push various outlets to report a false story in service to the national interest (there&#39;s well-documented instances of the US doing this in the leadup to a number of invasions; Chomsky&#39;s Manufacturing Consent is the definitive account of how it works). These are subtler problems, but its their subtlety that makes them so dire; everyone in this comment thread has probably believed some falsehood that was laundered in this way. &quot;Reputable outlet&quot; is not a proxy for &quot;almost certainly truthful&quot;, and relying on reputation can aid in media consolidation, when smaller, independent outlets can be the ones that do the important work of exposing bad journalism in the mainstream press.<br><br>As far as &quot;division&quot; goes, I don&#39;t give a lot of credence to the idea of opposing social division for the sake of opposing division. On some issues, you&#39;ve got to get confrontational to move the needle. Hot take but Black Lives Matter is actually important, and it exists in the form that it does because of the violence that was already present, and because several decades of non-confrontation and bargaining kind of failed.<br><br>But I don&#39;t believe in lying to people. I think honest and factual journalism, with good analysis and a clear eye for what&#39;s important are critically vital things. For YouTube, Facebook, and Twitter, separating the wheat from the chaff is a big and complicated issue, and it&#39;s bigger and more complicated than just out-and-out malicious behaviour. The full scope of the problem should be acknowledged and addressed, but I get the sense this fake-news freakout will only last until the obvious bad actors subside.

And I got pissed really fast: First of all, youtube used to be a platform where I would take strawls through the depths of some wired sub community after hours of clicking through random Russian home videos or whatever. All this is gone now. I don&#39;t see actual related videos anymore, I see anything and I can&#39;t explore. But the true problems lies somewhere else: This is essentially comparable to southparks explanation of freemium games (watch it if you haven&#39;t!)&#39;: Games need to be just good enough to keep you playing but not good enough for you to actually have fun. You need to pay to have fun. The same happens here: Content needs to be okay but if you actually saw real fun stuff, you might be happy. And happiness doesn&#39;t keep you looking. The algorithm plays a psychological game against you and its basically an addiction machine. Again, comparable to southparks &quot;Heroin Hero&quot;... you chase the golden dragon and you&#39;re so close, but no matter how hard you try you can never reach it. If I&#39;m looking for something specific, what is the best way for the algorithm to generate view time? Never let me find it. <br>The same applies to all this right wing, fake news, conspiracy theory etc. stuff: The algorithm is up 7x more likely to show that kind of content. Why? Because emotionally charged videos will keep you watching. Not the stuff you actually enjoy - the stuff you get mad and frustrated about. <br>This algorithm not only destroyed the classic youtube experience and (alongside other sites) is the main reason for filter-bubble/right wing conspiracy/etc. - I also strongly believe it will cause a lot of addictive tendencies and be the cause for real problems.\u00a0<br>@SmarterEveryDay : You say the engineers are heroes of this fight. Please consider actually reporting about the algorithm itself and its implications for the users. <br><br>TLDR;/And please always remember: Every time you visit youtube and go on a stroll, clicking through mediocre videos feeling unhappy and like you just wasted lots of time  afterwards - you just played a game against computer for your time &amp; attention.

From the technical to the psychological.  Well done, Destin!<br><br>The first technical thing - I&#39;ve wondered how the image hashes work.  My original thought was a literal hash of, say, every 10th (or first significant) frame.  But you are totally right, that&#39;s how resizing or warping the shape of the video would break a hash like that.  I suspect YouTube&#39;s original content ID system worked like that, but I think they&#39;ve probably done something a lot smarter now.  It&#39;s actually a very similar problem to fingerprint recognition.  You need to be able to recognize a fingerprint, or even a partial print, despite being rotated (or in the case of digital content, flipped).  At that point I think it&#39;s more about feature selection/recognition, and relation.  In the example of a fingerprint, you may consider a spot where two ridges combine to be a feature.  You may also consider a central circle to be another feature.  By finding the relationship between those two types of features, you then can compare the relationships, rather than the features themselves.  It&#39;s almost a bit like taking a derivative in the mathematical sense.  I suspect something like this could work - first convert the image to black/white, then run an edge detection algorithm (e.g.: down-sample, blur, then run something like Canny edge detection on it), then find the features (e.g.: a sharp point of change in contrast).  Find all features in the image, then compare their relationships (e.g.: angles and distances between features).  (On an unrelated note, tracking vaccination records by fingerprint is an amazing idea.  They don&#39;t change over time, people generally keep them all their life, and there&#39;s already existing low-cost tech to read fingerprints).<br><br>Another technical thing that can be done is trying to identify the fake accounts earlier on and perform something called &quot;hellbanning&quot;.  When an account is flagged as being a fake (e.g.: non-human), when it performs a &quot;like&quot;, a view or a comment, it appears to the account owner that the &quot;like&quot;, &quot;view&quot;, or comment has really happened, but to other users, it&#39;s invisible.  Basically, no one can hear you scream in space, so the account thinks it is having some sort of impact, but really, no one is hearing/seeing it.  When the &quot;bad guys&quot; are trying to manipulate the YouTube algorithm, they may be able to recognize this by having accounts check on each other, so it might not work well for YouTube, but it sure could work on forums.<br><br>The trick here is identifying the non-human accounts.  The low-hanging fruit is to recognize anything that is humanly impossible - e.g.: liking X number of videos in more than one second.  Or liking/commenting on videos for more than X hours a day.  I imagine Google has algorithms for doing exactly this.  Each user could end up with a rating (between 0 and 1), where 0 is a definite fake and 1 is a definite real (verified) user.  When a user interacts with something, their interaction is multiplied by their &quot;real/fake&quot; rating so that they have more/less impact depending if they are a real or a fake user.<br><br>Another thing they can do is create a graph of users and interactions.  The large bot-farms will have strong interactions among themselves, but very few real users early on (just like what you identified).  It&#39;d be interesting to see the graph of users in question and interactions between them, with the user rating displayed as a color.  I bet there&#39;s some really interesting information visualizations that could be done there (hey, if some Masters or PhD student wants to take that idea and run with it, please do!).<br><br>Now the psychological.  It&#39;s amazing how much better things work out if we treat each other with respect, and apply a bit of common sense.  If I run across a video like that with a definite weird vibe to it, you can bet that I&#39;m going to down-vote it and not bother watching the whole thing.  Unfortunately there&#39;s no way to flag videos like that, as they technically are still within the terms of service, but they are generated garbage like the examples you showed.  The trick is to allow people to still express displeasure with a topic/subject of a video, but without making it personal to the content creator.  E.g.: &quot;I might not agree with your take on the subject, but I still respect you&quot;.", "comment_date": "2019-04-07T00:13:16Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Dinomiite", "comment_text": "No wonder <b>some</b> youtubers have basically the same thumbnail", "comment_date": "2019-04-07T00:00:03Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Josh Derak", "comment_text": "This makes me think about Wonder Showzen.", "comment_date": "2019-04-06T23:53:36Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "David Nelson", "comment_text": "What if a website, like yours, was created and maintained with the simple goal of making us think it isn&#39;t YouTube&#39;s fault?

What is youtube supposed to defend against? 2nd you reference &quot;manufactured content&quot; in a negative light. Isnt all content manufactured? Please elaborate. <br>3rd - You discuss automated video production service that can get around the youtube algorithm and dump hundreds of videos. You mention how big of a problem that is and how youtube works to delvelop counter-counter measures. But im completly in the dark on the reason why? This is the biggest question for me. Please explain why youtube even cares about hundreds or millions of artificially produced vids. I understand that the power online content has over public opinion. But Youtube is a for profit corporation. Are you suggesting they give a hoot what how content is affecting opinions? I dont see how it has anything to do with them. Additionally, what right do they have in trying to control ideolgy promoted online? That is a slippery slope. I see how that can eventually hamper freedom of thought. Isnt it better if they stay out thought control business and let me decide what garbage I not going to watch. Im sure you have some clarifying thoughts on this.

However, I have to disagree with your conclusion that ultimately this all falls on us for allowing the exploitation of a &quot;flaw in our hearts&quot; and that the solution also falls entirely to us. This multifactorial issue can&#39;t and shouldn&#39;t be boiled down that far. We do need to be web-smart and kind. That last one has always been hard for humans and we didn&#39;t evolve with this level of connectivity that we&#39;re all trying to figure out. But the viewer&#39;s responsibility for humane behavior is just one part of a possible solution. You and your family, and all of us frankly, owe much to YouTube and the platform they provide, however, YouTube cannot and absolutely should not escape culpability in this whole affair. I&#39;m not going to post a link but please read the excellent Bloomberg article by Mark Bergen published a few days ago. YouTube has been ignoring problems, worshipping at the altar of engagement metrics, and focused on collecting profits for a decade+.  YouTube put this thing out there in the world and YouTube/Google benefits. Unless they are willing to provide the platform entirely for the public good without taking a profit they should be responsible to protect their users&#39;/customers&#39; safety and share responsibility with the creators for the effects the content and platform has on society. So the solution to a multifactorial problem is multifactorial. YouTube needs to do so much more, including fixing its messed up creator incentives. Creators need to be held responsible for their content. Humans on YouTube need to be smarter, kinder, and less ridiculously gullible. There are many many more factors in this problem/solution, factors with factors really. Lastly, keep up the fine work. I can&#39;t wait to see what else you uncover.", "comment_date": "2019-04-04T23:30:56Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "jfan4reva", "comment_text": "Recently I&#39;ve been thinking about how much nicer the internet was back when it was used mostly by geeks.

I will go out on a limb and disagree about your conclusions on how to change things. I do think that there is a public responsibility, but it isn&#39;t about changing &quot;hearts&quot;. It is more about creating separation between emotional &quot;gut&quot; instinct (fear, anger, and dismissal of opponents who are framed as such) in both a timing and mental sense. <br><br><br>And, as they stand today, tech companies do NOT seek to temper our very human, chemical and  neurological, responses. Instead, the current tech giants (mostly) hijack these because it drives up engagement, ad revenues, etc and because they exist in an informal vacuum of regulation because their speed of change outpaces the government and our government is just woefully under informed about technology in general.<br><br><br>To change these things, we actually need to apply pressure at 3 different points: <br>1) The companies themselves need to change what metrics and human systems they are monetizing and utilizing to be &quot;successful&quot; (less short term impulsive engagement and more quality + long term dialectical engagement ).<br>2) Government needs more technical know how, but that will require hiring budgets and staffing goals that reflect that desire. We need to be willing to pay attention and pay up if we don&#39;t want to be at the whims of rogue algorithms and secret formulas from the private sector.<br>3) Individuals need to take it upon themselves to not immediately hit reply (ok, so I did that here but I&#39;ve thought about and researched these issues for years now), to digest what they have watched before responding and not to constantly keep stimulative media open. Having down time and refractory periods between receiving information and acting on it may not FEEL as good as acting impulsively but it is still a core part of our evolutionary biology. Our subconscious continues to build associations and network together information, as well as add more critical thinking about what we are actually seeing, over time. But that requires that we take that time, and don&#39;t paper over it with more engagement.<br><br><br>I hope you see this comment Destin and add your own thoughts to it.

They earned the ad revenue fair and square because the service for which is paid is rendered: people have seen the ads on their screens. (not talking about fake views by bots and such, but about the part played by the content uploader)<br>I also disagree that people have an inherent urge to fight their neighbours... I think maybe you are referring to scalable competitiveness, where demographic groups will act competitively towards other groups of the same scale. Within a certain group, when observing a smaller scale, new subgroups will be distinguishable who will in turn act competitively towards eachother until the higher scale competition reappears. I would not call that an urge to fight neighbours. No urge to fight, but to compare. The grass is greener type of thing.<br>But social media have given a disproportionate weight to a couple other bad traits of mankind. The two main ones are vanity and jealousy. Another one that has been around longer and has been played to by all media for a long time, is fear. It too, has grown out of proportion. If we want to make humankind more resisting against the abuse that is portrayed in this video, we need to address those inbalances in our priorities. We need to become realistic again. Real again. We don&#39;t need to be &quot;great&quot;, we need to be &quot;real&quot;. And realistic on all fronts. Not just about how we watch news or how we spend money. But also how we perceive ourselves and others. The affirmative movements, for example, are greatly threatening our existence in the future with their unrealistic views. Even though they claim to be supporting everyone&#39;s equality, in fact they thrive off jealousy and fear and they spread false and wrong expectations among the people. This unlimited &quot;freedom&quot; that everybody thinks to be entitled to, will only result in extinction of the societies who endorse such politics and the prevailing of those societies who do not. If we truly want to protect our freedom, we must face the truths. Truths like &quot;fat people are not beautiful, they are unhealthy&quot; (with which I pass NO judgement of anyone&#39;s character, merely the biological FACTS. They are not opinions and therefor non-negotiable) or how discrimination goes in all directions and currently in most western countries the demographic that is targeted the most by discrimination and hate are white men, or just men in general. But also truths like &quot;we DON&#39;T NEED the latest smartphone&quot; or even &quot;we CAN&#39;T AFFORD to each own all gadgets&quot;. Choices are mandatory limiting factors in life that generate diversity. The irrational expectation of always getting everything and getting it instantly is therefor threatening the human diversity. A diversity that is dearly needed because it is out of diversity that most fertile combinations sprout, and it is in adversity that the highest genious revealed.<br><br><br>So, the &quot;urge to fight&quot; is imho an urge to compare and compete, which stimulates genious and increases diversity... The only reason why this characteristic can now be abused, is because the majority of people choses to allow their own values and priorities be deformed and be pulled out of balance. <br><br><br>I wonder if anyone will ever read all this.

This is the first one I&#39;ve given a thumbs down. Not because of the content, which is very interesting and well researched as always. It&#39;s because of that VPN you&#39;re advertising. The company itself seems ok but the information about online tracking you give is incomplete and even a little bit wrong because it gives a false sense of security. To avoid being tracked on the internet one has to consider a lot and masquerading your IP address (which by the way is not broadcast anywhere unless you are on an unsecured WiFi) is only a (small) part of it. They don&#39;t even make a good base for tracking (IPv6 is a different story) because IP addresses for private costumers change all the time and can be shared with several other devices (e.g. all devices on a private WiFi usually share only one public IPv4 address). If you really want to track somebody you&#39;d use things like tracking cookies, 1x1 images or more advanced stuff like browser fingerprinting and a lot more. None of these can be avoided by using a VPN. You&#39;d also have to trust your VPN Provider wholeheartedly, because now he can see and manipulate all your DNS queries and (unencrypted) traffic and learn a lot about your internal network.<br>Sorry about the rant. VPNs can of course be useful for several cases like circumventing censorship or hiding your location (which is not very accurate btw and tells you the city of origin at best) but is pretty much useless for avoiding online tracking unless you take other measures as well. <br>You are a smart and educated man with a very high reputation and I&#39;m just a bit disappointed hearing this from someone like you.

More active gatekeeping could help a lot but who gets to make the rules? where should they draw the line? more stringent rules will lead to more false positives punishing honest original content creators and it also acts as a form of censorship or media control.<br>I think that in general restrictions should be kept at a minimum as to not risk punishing honest content creators and to allow users their rights to freedom of speech regardless of intent and ideology. Another big issue that is related to this is Youtubes automatic copyright system which basically allows any one to claim videos or strike the creator taking away their ad-revenue until it has been reviewed and there are many cases where Youtube refuses to protect the content creators from fraudulent claims. There are companies that only exist to &quot;help&quot; artists and media creators to go through youtube content looking for videos to claim, not caring to check if those content creators have acquired rights to that content or if it would fall into the category of fair use.<br>Algorithms are great tools to sift trough vast amounts of data but algorithms can be tricked and in the end Youtube will need more human eyes to combat these issues.

However, youTube manages to bring up very similar suggestions when it comes to audio tracks with static image in them. For example, i like to listen electronic music and because of youTube algorithmic suggestions, i have actually discovered many artists who create music that i enjoy.

It is name of Algeria by french so from my points of view those people who are sharing this kind of videos aren&#39;t even Americans. Just random people or maybe they are Algerian-American like me. But if they do this kind of things they should done it in Algeria, Since Algeria we do not have any kind of surveillance nothing secure via any internet security things. So anybody can post anything basically. Just an idea if Google want to prevent this kind of things. They should recreate new Algo (Algorithm). For example recognize faces first than find corner of every picture take original picture and take faces location do some math to figure out the corners or pivots of Matrices. then try to get 10 seconds since it is very hard to analyse these kind of data using more than 10s. so 10s would be enough or take 2s by splitting matrix of time into many 2 second choose 5 of them analyse pictures and see different from faces. If not face try to convert all voices into one kind of voice. and see different try to figure out words robot saying basically develop new idea of Voice Recognition. I have like over view how it should done but I CANNOT explain more than this by some words. It has to be design and analyze to a non programmer person to understand.

As long as views are tied to ads are tied to revenue, we are going to have this problem. After we hit the political unity button and everyone is generally on the same page about loving their neighbor or whatever, the system is still there, and as long as it exists in its current form, it can be gamed, because we are flawed humans with psyches that can be exploited. Twitter, Youtube, and Facebook just created the tools to make it REALLY EASY to figure out how, in the name of getting eyeballs on stuff to get paid by advertisers.<br><br>You solve the problem by decoupling the web from ad revenue. As much as I believe in human goodness, I&#39;m not optimistic that the political unity button is getting pressed anytime soon--especially since there&#39;s a financial incentive for anyone willing to abuse the system to keep our hands away from the button.", "comment_date": "2019-04-02T23:43:05Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "GodsChildren", "comment_text": "newsfactory&#39;s lol", "comment_date": "2019-04-02T23:41:53Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "caterpillermiller", "comment_text": "I love seeing Brady\u2019s rocket ship at <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1PGm8LslEb4&amp;t=3m01s\">3:01</a>", "comment_date": "2019-04-02T23:37:30Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "WillN2Go1", "comment_text": "This is remarkable, but not that surprising.  <br>Saying &#39;most of it is economically motivated,&#39; hides the level of actual harm, and fits into the excuses the tech giants that enables this behavior.  The business model of YouTube and Facebook is that it&#39;s all handled by algorithms. It&#39;s not hard to fool an algorithm and then tell a bold faced lie.   <br>The example of the &#39;left&#39; doing this scam,  may not be what it seems. (I&#39;m not saying the &#39;left&#39; doesn&#39;t do these things. I don&#39;t know. It can be a complex situation.  CYA for a one sided propaganda scam is to plant  some examples of &#39;the other side&#39; doing the same thing, then when they&#39;re caught, their intended targets don&#39;t feel like suckers, they shrug and say, &quot;Aw, everybody is doing it.&#39;  <br><br>Usually a propaganda gambit like this has basic goals. First, to keep hammering down the people who are generally on the side they want to keep them, and second, to scare people. When we are frightened we Freeze, Flight or Fight, but thinking gets pushed way down the list because we&#39;re reacting to a threat.   <br>You ask what can an engineer do with the algorithm. How about hiring more people to look for this stuff?   YouTube and Google are responsible.  Their business model is all scale and minimal overhead, user agreements, laws, etc protect them from being held responsible for what someone does on their platform. If someone committed a crime at my house, I would tell the police, I&#39;m not responsible, they trespassed and then committed this crime; but if it goes on day after day, month after month; while I make billions of dollars? I may not have committed the crimes, but I&#39;ve been negligent by allowing it to continue. <br>Consider a bar, people come in, they get drunk, some level of misbehavior results.  The bartender and owner didn&#39;t cause this, but if it persists, or people are murdered,  that place is going to get shut down (I helped close three bars, so this I know about). <br>However It&#39;s scale. A bar allows it, or can&#39;t stop it, you or I allow it, we will be shut down. But if a huge corporation allows it.... <br><br>&#39;if you&#39;re outraged right now at YouTube.... Then you don&#39;t get it. You don&#39;t see what&#39;s happening.&#39;   They built the platform, they make billions of dollars from it, they don&#39;t manage what happens in their business; they may not be &#39;responsible&#39; and they may try to stop it, but if it continues, they are negligent. How difficult is it to set up a YouTube channel anonymously? No individual, no street address, no ID? Right there. Honest people do not hide, crooked people hide. Google and YouTube have a problem, they don&#39;t want to address it. When a bar attracts young people, they card everybody at the door. <br><br>I also think that why you start talking psychology, &#39;the human heart,&#39; you are way past your area of expertise. Most people are good, everywhere (I&#39;ve been around). &quot;They&#39;re using all their math....but until our hearts change...&quot;  It&#39;s their business, part of the way they do business has distorted our democracy, rips us off economically, spies on us and sells us. I mentioned to a 20-something person, &quot;Remember when Google&#39;s motto was, &#39;Don&#39;t be evil.&#39;&quot; He said, &quot;It was?&quot;   The closing bars stuff I mentioned? I worked with my community including the local street gang, the LAPD and anyone who would help, and we turned the crime rate in our neighborhood from the highest number of reporting incidents in the city to one of the lowest. Very few people were arrested. On all sides there were people going on about how hard it was to change other people, the same bit as your  homily-- they weren&#39;t contributors.", "comment_date": "2019-04-02T23:34:23Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Awbluefy", "comment_text": "<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1PGm8LslEb4&amp;t=5m18s\">5:18</a> how did that happen? surely this person&#39;s channel was hacked or something. and they had just uploaded a week prior. crazy.", "comment_date": "2019-04-02T23:32:09Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "ch\ua735s", "comment_text": "smarter every day why you say flaw in your heart not flaw in your brain man", "comment_date": "2019-04-02T23:31:17Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Photorocket", "comment_text": "Thanks for some great content.

Even they don&#39;t have enough computational power and storage (OK, they might have the storage) to maintain a recommender for every single user.  But every single user has more than enough to do this.  Done correctly, this basically can&#39;t be gamed.  However, by its very architecture it cuts YouTube out of the loop almost entirely.  They would no longer have the preferences information that they sell to advertisers.  All that preference information would stay on the clientside.  They would also have to serve more data to users so that filtering can be done on clientside rather than serverside which would increase their costs.

One single bit difference and it might as well be an entirely separate movie.  Most comparisons are sort of profile or sporadic sample based, so you scan it, build a profile using some heuristics, such as frame luminosity, and build a profile of the video.  It works pretty great, but the down-side is that it takes a fair bit of time to compare, so you have to keep profiles small.  It also harder to put into fast storage compared to hashes.

I am thankful for all the work you do, my kids and I enjoy trading bed time stories for your science videos and discussing what we learned together, so thank you! Regarding this topic and your previous video where you discuss what you ACTUALLY do for a living (which is pretty much my childhood dream of a job I never knew could possibly exist), you are exposing the fringe of the cyber domain of warfare you had discussed. I think this information is absolutely essential to anyone and everyone who uses technology to reach out to others. If they hadn\u2019t been taught to fact check and not to believe the first story they read, then this will and should definitely open their eyes to how easily someone can be manipulated. I am thankful to have had very strict teachers in my schooling who (before we were allowed to use the internet for references) we had to cite all of our research and fact check using multiple sources. I assumed this was common practice but as I got older I found out it was not the case. My boys are only 8 and 9 years old and already use Google (in a very strict and controlled environment at school and home) to research school projects. As they get older and have a broader perception of what the internet actually is and can be and how useful it is as well as how destructive it can be, this video and parts 2 and 3 upcoming will be a topic of discussion for the rest of their lives. I don\u2019t know how you do it, but you do it well and thank God that you do because it really helps a lot of people. Also, I gotta say, my kids and I would love to be able to meet * you some day. We live in Cali and when I saw the rocket golf club video I was very jealous! But then I kinda figured it was no coincidence that you may have been in California during the Vandenberg AFB test of the ground based interceptor salvo launched to destroy an ICBM while it was still outside our atmosphere.

We might be at the point where people have to register a channel with some sort of proof of who you are, and then you are given two channels to name what they want. So people can make anonymous channels and make one with their identity more public. And you can get more channels eventually if you are making genuine content with a genuine viewership. I myself don&#39;t like google having that info, but fixing problems often in life mean you have to sacrifice something for it. perhaps the gov could make a id database of citizens that have some generated number attached. Something kinda like a social security number but just for the internet. And that is sent to google. So you go to the gov to get the number. where you prove you are a citizen and they make sure you aren&#39;t already in the system. The database could just be a name and associated number. held encrypted in the database. Maybe other info could be held their as well to use the number to verify other things like address. it would look work like a lookup service where you lookup a number and get encrypted data back. The data encryption keys are shared between the gov and only a few select companies that prove they have the network staff and security to protect the key.

The Gs alpha subunit of the stimulated G protein complex exchanges GDP for GTP and is released from the complex. The activated Gs alpha subunit binds to and activates an enzyme called adenylyl cyclase, which, in turn, catalyzes the conversion of ATP into cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP), directly increasing the cAMP level. Four cAMP molecules are able to bind to the two R-subunits. This is done by two cAMP molecules binding to each of the two cAMP binding sites (CNB-B and CNB-A) which induces a conformational change in the regulatory subunits of PKA causing the subunits to detach and unleash the two (now activated) catalytic subunits.[7]", "comment_date": "2019-04-01T22:48:54Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "FoxxiePaws", "comment_text": "if only those people who are doing these counter measures to the algorithms did something useful like say worked on making the internet a better place", "comment_date": "2019-04-01T22:46:26Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Greg Smith", "comment_text": "Ban robot voices.", "comment_date": "2019-04-01T22:45:43Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "jod125", "comment_text": "How do they make money?

Why would our gamers take a healthy, normal brain function and turn it schizophrenic. Easy; AGAIN, it&#39;s a preemptive crippling of people who they know have a higher chance of having high awareness/ being conscious/being aware of the simulation and the peculiarities that reveal we&#39;re in a simulation.<br><br>At the end of the day treat schizophrenia like a trick being played on you that never ends because you&#39;re being played the fool,you&#39;re thinking and the response you Thinking/expecting is constantly relayed back to you so the conversation could practically go on forever. So people with schiz think they&#39;re having a convo with someone; Picture this you place a thought in a hole in a wall and then whatever response you were/expecting thinking comes back out the hole, you think someone&#39;s talking back too you but it&#39;ss just the answer that your mind expect. SO there&#39;s practically a response to every query/thought. this will result in you thinking you&#39;re talking to someone. Especially if you instinctively, naturally, or as a creative person make the voice into another person. or ironically create more voice [in the sense that you&#39;re NOT trying to hear the voices and more thoughts come because you end up thinking harder about the thoughts you don&#39;t want.] a good method is to think a thought to death; suppressing/rejecting something like a powerful/important thought can force to circle through your head more harmfully and powerfully<br><br><br>////&quot;/&quot;&gt;:::::/&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&gt;:&gt;:::::&gt;:&gt;////&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;/////&quot;/&quot;/&#39;/&quot;/", "comment_date": "2019-04-01T19:37:33Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "SimpLee Beth", "comment_text": "Should political content be monetized at all???", "comment_date": "2019-04-01T19:35:44Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "DerParadonym", "comment_text": "Youtube algorithm exactly knows what I want.

I think it makes sense because of the last 150 years, because of the industrial revolution. During that time the goal was to produce as much as possible using machines and get a lot of money. Obviously this mindset still exists. But I believe Seth Godin and Kevin Kelly that the industrial revolution is ending because of the internet. They say that this old mindset of maximizing production and revenue is changing and it&#39;s going to be replaced with a connection economy (internet). I think more and more people like Destin from this channel are going to create more quality videos made with passion, give more, create connections with their audience and establish trust. I think more people are going to realize that this is the way to go and it&#39;s beneficial in the long run instead of making a quick buck. Of course people that just want money are still going to exist, but less of them, it&#39;s going to get better.

This whole doomday-talk, which has been happening ever since Trump got elected, feels far more manipulative than the actual videos themselves. As for engineers trying to fight that stuff, they might do their best, but Youtube isn&#39;t. Youtube cares about  clicks and ads, they care about quality content only when it gets bad enough that it reduces the clicks and ad money (e.g. they only react to controversial content when it hits mainstream news and starts influencing advertisers). Plain old human curation (by users themselves, not Youtube) or just some configurability in the recommendation algorithm could quickly put an end to this, but Youtube won&#39;t allow that. The real manipulative powerhouse in all this is Youtube themself, they are the sole arbiter of what people get to watch and what just disappears on their servers without ever getting any views.

Partisanship is great for engagement, which is exactly what the recommendation algorithm is optimized for.

We all used to think that clickbait thumbnails of half-naked women were an unavoidable problem that could only be fixed on a \u2018community level\u2019, too. But YouTube took a stand and actively changed their system. Radicalizing content isn\u2019t algorithmically prioritized because of individual failures, it\u2019s prioritized because it happens to make platforms a lot of revenue.

To make matters worse, YT also tracks your behaviour on a video and if you back out of watching it, YT will stop suggesting that channel to you for a short while, preventing you from immediately blocking it. Reddit has also started serving me tracked content despite doing everything I can to block them - r/all for me often has multiple articles on the front page that simply don&#39;t have the traffic or relevancy to get there, and they&#39;re usually controversial and / or divisive.

Media literacy: Know how to identify the source of information and verify its accuracy, and develop a broad range of trusted providers (friends/coworkers/websites/youtube channels, whatever they may be) who can be used to cross-check a new piece of information. If a source is frequently inaccurate, deceptive or manipulative, stop trusting it and don&#39;t give them revenue.<br><br><br>2. Bias awareness: Understanding our own biases and the biases of others helps us to better interpret the information we&#39;re receiving, and teaches us to make sure we&#39;re listening with our critical AND empathetic faculties engaged, regardless of the source.<br><br><br>3. Reward good-faith content/arguments, and do your best to limit your intake and output of bad-faith content/arguments: a good-faith argument is one where the intent is to honestly inform the listener. It can be persuasive or informational in content, but it can&#39;t be manipulative or untruthful. Think of the way you&#39;d try to convince a friend to go to a new restaurant. You&#39;d tell them the great things on the menu, how good the service is, and how reasonable the prices are. You&#39;d ALSO tell them that sometimes there&#39;s a long wait and that it&#39;s a bit of a drive! You don&#39;t want the downsides to be a nasty surprise, so you reveal them upfront, perhaps even as you minimize their importance. You&#39;re biased, afterall, because you like the restaurant, but your goal isn&#39;t to force your friend to agree; it&#39;s to make sure they have all the information they need, good or bad, to have a great experience.

Even if you change the internal sliders to add variation to the robotic voices, it should still be possible with machine learning. In fact, If i can get my hands on a good database that includes both real human voices and robotic voices, I might give it a try myself. There is always a chance it wont work, but I&#39;m confident.<br><br><br>Even if I managed to create a detector with 95% accuracy, there are still a few issues that I can think of off the top of my head. I foresee that cheap voice synthesizers are only going to get better and better over time (ironically with machine learning), so eventually this technique may not work because the &quot;robotic&quot; voices will sound too closely to real humans. Theoretically, even small patterns that are not obvious to humans can arise when machine learning is applied, but at that level you can never be sure until you try. The best way to combat this is to use the same database that was used to generate the synthesizer to build an anti-synthesizer.<br><br>Of course, there is the other problem regarding content policy. Should videos with robotic voices be banned? I feel like the answer should be no, but one could say that a ban like that would only affect a few legitimate content creators, and the rest are fake news . Therefore, the trade-off would be favorable. Maybe we would need to use multiple algorithms together. One that categorizes videos while the other checks the audio. E.g. all videos that are labeled &quot;political&quot; and &quot;robotic&quot; get banned, but not &quot;humor&quot; and &quot;robotic&quot; or &quot;gaming&quot; and &quot;robotic&quot;.", "comment_date": "2019-04-01T02:41:18Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "x", "comment_text": "\u8c22\u8c22\uff01", "comment_date": "2019-04-01T02:40:44Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Zigzwag Props", "comment_text": "I have started saying this more and more recently, as I watch the way that we as people move forward in our technological age.

Part of the problem was how to use it enough that it would make a difference, but not so much that the enemy could tell that the code had been broken. The problem became one of math. The axis had mathematicians that could calculate the real odds of things like how often things should go wrong, how often boats should be sunk by chance, how often the allies should get lucky, etc. And they could find deviations in these baselines that pointed to the fact that it wasn&#39;t random chance that an event occurred because it was happening far too often to be random.

While this may be true, it is not obvious to me why it should be true. As you said, the algorithm optimizes \u201cuser watch time\u201d \u2013 this does not necessarily translate to quality, well-researched content. If anything, it is exactly these kind of polarizing, controversial content that, on average, seems to maximize user watch time.\r<br><br><br>One might argue that the tech companies do have an incentive to crack down on bot videos as there is a risk of users leaving the platform altogether when they are overrun with this kind of content. However, as you mentioned, real people started commenting and engaging on that example bot video. If the video has real engagement and increases the average user time spent on the platform, is this video necessarily bad for YouTube just because it has artificially increased metrics? It\u2019s not clear \u2013 and that\u2019s why it\u2019s not obvious why they should be working on fixing this (if indeed they are). \r<br><br><br>I\u2019m not making YouTube (or other social platforms) out to be the bad guy. If there aren\u2019t laws that mandate social platforms to police this kind of content, it wouldn\u2019t be fair to expect them to expend resources to fix this problem of their own accord. Where it gets complicated in the US is that these tech companies do have very real influence on the laws that get passed. \r<br><br><br>As fascinating as the techniques used to manipulate the algorithms are, I believe there is a bigger issue here in terms of aligning incentives better.

Then how long did it take for you to find all those other videos (that Youtube engineering and maths failed to find), not long at all.

The medium to long term trend goes like this:  For every N views, you get N/10 likes.  For every N likes, you get about N/10 dislikes.    As the video grows in the number of views, the view to like ratio tends to fall off, the more people who view the video, the less engaged they are and the less they like/dislike/comment.  As I write this, this video has 270k views and 29k likes, so he&#39;s slightly above the 10% trend, and has 3,036 comments, which means he&#39;s above the 10% engagement and that will likely drive his video towards &quot;trending&quot; and increase the views.  The dislikes are 456, which is roughly 15% of the likes, so approximately 5% higher than the norm.  This increase also points to greater than average engagement, which will drive the video towards trending.  The number of comments is about 11%, so higher than the 10% engagement average for likes, also pointing to increased engagement.

It does seem at times that the principle focus of US high schools is the devout belief that the USA is the greatest country ever ever.

First, the reason the globes etc are in the places they are isn&#39;t so much a direct attempt to trick youtube, the people that set up the scripts that make and upload these videos are just downloading a ton of free, sometimes royalty free, sometimes stolen from legitimate asset packages, etc &quot;news video&quot; templates that are designed for content creators, film makers, etc. For example that BBC style intro you showed early on is a pretty common free template you&#39;ll see across various channels. There isn&#39;t as much thought put into it as you&#39;re ascribing it, in one template that spinning globe asset was on one side in another it was somewhere else. The same globe is there basically only because the same person/company made that template. In that template it should be sitting behind footage since it&#39;s just there to add some background motion, but then algorithm scammers aren&#39;t exactly in it to produce polished content. The snow and other effects however are generally purposefully there in an attempt to fool the algorithm.<br><br>\u00a0Most of the time aspects of the scripts, video titles, ect are generated with an algorithm of some kind. Unlike the video generation example you showed these are mostly tossed together scripts built with open source video APIs and code. The person making the videos will just click a button and their scripts will scrape news headlines, sometimes legitimate sites for keywords like &quot;Trump&quot; &quot;supreme court&quot; &quot;EU&quot; &quot;breaking news&quot; &quot;brexit&quot; &quot;nancy pelosi&quot;, etc. Or just pull from various fake news/ultra partisan sites then scrape the text of the article then slap an image or video from the article or just the first image the Google Images API returned when they fed it the title of the article in a template, throw it through a free text to speech API, maybe add an effect, render it out and toss it on youtube.<br><br>Youtube&#39;s neural network LOVES certain keywords for various reasons, sometimes because it naturally drives clicks, sometimes because the neural network just connects some random noise and decides that syringes are all the rage with the under 8 crowd, as you might recall from a when youtube kids was flooded with weird videos of Spiderman or Elsa doing things with syringes and/or pregnancy. If the videos tags and various aspects can get packed with enough algorithm bait by a whatever markov chain or text generation algorithm is filling in tags it&#39;ll get snapped up and end up in a thousand side bars and recommended pages. Now I&#39;m not saying this is an easy problem to fix but this kind of exploit-ability is simply what happens when you have a neural network trying to work with this much data and do something so complex. Granted it&#39;s basically the only way to do it and hopefully as these neural networks get better honed at it they&#39;ll start sorting this out. If you really want to address this the most realistic way to approach this is to educate people to avoid highly partisan/fake news, but weak people love having their biases confirmed and society as a whole will need time to adapt to the ability to easily get news that just masturbates your ego rather than expressing reality. I would love to see more data on this but I heavily suspect people engaging this kind of stuff skews heavily towards the over 40 crowd and those who are under-educated.", "comment_date": "2019-03-31T23:41:07Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Salma & Lucas", "comment_text": "First comment ever, to help the algorithm", "comment_date": "2019-03-31T23:40:42Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Cameron.", "comment_text": "I&#39;ve been seeing these types of videos on the right of videos and in my feed for a long while.

No more bots uploading 3k videos in days. Now that alone won&#39;t stop massive testing of videos for ad revenue since you can probably create tons of channels.<br><br>Second, cap max accounts per IP per day. Sure there&#39;ll be a bit of DOS because of this but it shouldn&#39;t be too bad for the business itself after a bit since you can watch without an account and if you&#39;re just creating an account you probably won&#39;t be earning YT tons of money from ad revenue, especially with the following<br><br>Three, allow new channels/accounts to be linked to an established account which bypasses the IP limit. This allows existing users who have been making good content and receiving revenue to create other channels regardless of bot caused IP ban DOS. Not really sure how multiple channels work as it is so maybe half of the work&#39;s already done. This also means if one channel gets terminated you can, and probably should, terminate all of them because they&#39;re likely to jump to another channel and upload virtually the same content there, or at least get put on a manual review/watch list. Obviously if one account is getting lots of channels (especially quickly) that&#39;s probably bots and can be terminated and manually reviewed after the fact upon request.<br><br>Four, allow bypassing the cap by submitting verification of identity. This not only means you don&#39;t have to worry much about them being a bot but also if they start producing stupid content that gets them banned you can do better than an IP ban.<br><br>Five, you saw this coming right? Don&#39;t allow ad revenue without verification of identity until a year of semi-consistent uploads without rule violations or until you&#39;d be earning something like $100 a year.

Yes the engineers are working very hard with all of their available tools but it&#39;s a lot like trying to use a nuclear bomb on a shed full of hey . . . just light a match. The algorithm is too far in it&#39;s infancy to truly be effective. I am sure one day it will certainly be better but in the mean time YouTube needs to allow it&#39;s users more control over what gets recommended. The original recommendation system worked great and was catered very well to what I, and I think most users, liked to watch. However, now just by clicking on a certain type of video the algorithm goes nuts with only recommending similar videos. Or if it is a unique video then it just tells you to watch it again. That is okay maybe the first 20 times I watch the video. It is a very odd grey area though where I do not want to claim content as &#39;not interested&#39; because at some point  down the road I know I will be interested again and do not want the algorithm to send it into oblivion. Just maybe not every second of every day I am on YouTube would be nice. It would not be hard for users to coordinate their own defenses against these manipulators if we had any tiny bit of control. However, YouTube has decided for the sake of trying to keep users online as long as possible that they have to decide what we want to watch. Just give users the ability to override the algorithm if they want to. Most users will continue to use the default algorithm settings.

Instead of fighting hate, fight the machine. One think AI still lacks is creativity. There are sufficiently good real random number generators, that create unique content, but not anything meaningful. Machines always have repetitiveness which could be easily caught by algorithm (not hashes, they are too restrictive). However, human generated content is not random, but unique and it takes a lot of time and resources.

The importance is to teach, when looking at news, you have to look at it from where it comes from.

I fell for that (but in a sense I didn&#39;t, I read it, didn&#39;t know so didn&#39;t believe it and cared not enough to trace it to facts (obviously IG isn&#39;t a place to find truths, it&#39;s a place to find and then look for verification from actual sources).

He&#39;s done really epic things when it comes to love. He basically travels to warzones to ease people&#39;s pains and create moods of friendship. He pays to exercise health-care rather than ask the people he provides it to to pay him. He also gives lectures in which he talks about how love is actually an intelligence - something anyone can get better at - and about creating a universal school for love. So maybe we can get smarter about love and unity by asking this man some questions... <br><br>Robin Williams&#39; Patch Adams court scene (YouTube) made me want to get to know mister Adams.

I admire that and thank you for all your content.  As I watch your recent videos, I&#39;m left wondering what I can do.  I thought of sharing your video with many folks I know whose opinions are spiked with false information from various internet sources.  My own mother is a skeptical, smart MD and yet her mind is set that all republicans are misogynist racists.  I will share this video with her, though I suspect it won&#39;t change a thing.  And that&#39;s the thing, and perhaps something you&#39;ve spent time pondering.  Human nature seems to be the root cause of why this misinformation age persists (as you pointed out.)  So the purpose of my comment is to thank you for using your popularity to get this kind of content out to a large audience, in defiance of what seems like a rather bleak outlook.  I also want to suggest addressing the topic of persuasion.  I mentioned that I wonder, and do not know what I can do.  I want to try and persuade people with my opinions based on my sources, and it yet I&#39;ve never once been successful.

Why would russians help Trump after knowing they can/have made lucrative deals with Hillary already. 2. hillary and putin had a hatred for the usa in common. You want to talk about manipulating algorithms to promote your ideology; when that is the pinnacle of what she is.... This is just more democrat control, and this isn&#39;t even coming from an american. She worked for the Obama administration, works on the council of foreign relations (an un-elected elitist group that was founded by Rockefeller to sway politics in his business and crush competition). You have a serious problem in the united states and its democrats and republicans being swayed at the highest levels of government. This means 1 or 2 things is happening. People are getting bribed or people are getting threatened. Something to note: the presidents salary is 400,000 top banker salary is 15+ million. Yet you are expected to believe that this is somehow the most powerful person on earth? Sure when it comes to policy decisions maybe in some areas yes. But wealth is power to a lot of people(especially tyrannical billionaire elites who pose as not that). You see, even if all of Trumps businesses were failing there is way too much money to be made through bribes that he could care less about his businesses. Do you really expect a BILLIONAIRE to just reduce his salary to 400k because he &quot;wants to help his country&quot;. He has taken many many bribes already, from Saudi Arabia and from the coal industry. It can be seen by his first thing that he did while he was in office, he gave the largest weapons deal over to Saudi Arabia (a country he routinely bashed and blamed 9/11 on during his campaign) ever in history.

Number one is to determine motivation because ultimately that is what drives it all and creates the horse race in the first place. They could create a &quot;Motivation Parser Algorithm&quot; that helps the engineers separate the POST, from the POSTER, from the WATCHER.  To do this simply provide a &quot;BOGUS&quot; button, that watchers can hit that sends a RED ALERT to YouTube that something is amiss so they can quickly review it and if it violates content guidelines, kill it before  it goes viral.  If there is nothing wrong with the post, they can review the WATCHERS who flagged the video, and see if there is a connection between them and if there is (like common IP subnets which would indicate BOT farms), cancel those watcher accounts. Next they can review the POSTER, to see if this is a trend for that POSTER and if it is, they cancel the POSTER.  But I&#39;m wasting my breath even suggesting such things because the real truth is they aren&#39;t as interested in cleaning out the bad actors as they are trying to figure out how they can make money from what the bad actors are doing too.

Even under the reporting option, the section called intentional misdirection, or fake news, or intentional algorithm manipulation, or just plain bullshit, is not one of the options even available.<br><br>Youtube is absolutely at fault and it was a profit-motivated decision, not an oversight or mean people abusing poor youtube&#39;s algorithm. They provide no distinctions between &#39;I simply disagree with you&#39; and &#39;&#39;the production quality was off today&#39;, and &#39;this is absolute manipulative bullshit of viewers&#39;, and &#39;this is absolute manipulative bullshit of your own algorithm&#39;.<br><br>They just call it all &#39;engagement&#39; and all of THAT is considered positive. In such a dystopian system, can you imagine why they might have a problem propagating fake news, fake outrage, and hyper-partisan content that sells clicks? Or imagine any way they would view any of that as a negative? The only negative is when advertisers point to specific categories and then youtube over-reacts and filters out that content.<br><br>Meanwhile, the fake-everything thrives by design. Youtube is absolutely to blame, they set the rules and refuse to do ANYTHING that might reduce their profits.<br><br>I&#39;m all for your 3-part series, but it&#39;s going to be more of the same where corps refuse to do the right thing, or even allow for the right thing, because mah profits.<br><br>Big platforms do not have the staff to watch everything, but the audience does watch it, and it&#39;s a free and easily usable crowd-funding approach.

If you recall, all throughout the early days of the internet broadcast media made a massive effort to tell us not to trust anything we read or heard online. it was essentially tauted as &quot;the wild west&quot; of information, where lawlessness ran rampant. the reasons for doing this were two fold:<br><br><br>1: yes anyone could contribute to the narrative online, with real information, misinformation or even disinformation. <br><br><br>2: this did make the cultural narrative a much broader and hard to control beast. which takes away the ability to monopolize and control the political discourse.<br><br><br>Before I go any further, i would like to stress that this is not an argument for which side of bi-partisan politics anyone subscribes. with a tiny bit of digging, it is easy to find that both political parties are guilty of the exact same practices. That being said, because of the moneyed interests that dominate our political discourse, mainstream media did have comfortably uncontested sway over public opinion, which (unlike the petty arguing between political parties would indicate) has been very effectively used to solidify money as power in our culture. after-all, if you wanted to have a voice in the mainstream discourse, you were required to pay a premium for advertising and media buy. this became brutally obvious when Bernie Sanders began his campaign for president. all of a sudden there was a political hopeful directly stating that monetary influence has poisoned our political discourse, and has created a ruling class of oligarchs. needless to say, absolutely NO mainstream media outlets were going to platform this message. they were not going to give this man a chance to take away billions of dollars in campaign money and advertising every couple of years, and they were not about to let their corporate sponsors down by letting someone talk bad about their intentions on broadcast media. <br><br><br>the interesting thing is, Bernie still got popular. he still rivaled the best connected, most powerful oligarch of the democratic party. and he did it all through online campaign building, social networking, and grassroots organizing. Bernie used the internet to communicate ideas that everyone was receptive to, because we all know our political system is rigged against us because of the money that attracts the attention of our representatives more than our votes do. But the interesting part is, the entire time Bernie was gaining popularity, he was also proving for the first time, that the internet was a viable platform for social discourse and peer to peer political campaigning. The Mainstream Media, and the Oligarch class that has used it for years to rule without contest suddenly had a major problem. they suddenly had to compete for the control of ideas, when  previously they thought they had discredited their competition enough to keep control. Their reaction to the new reality they faced was swift, and terrifying. The pro Clinton super-pacs started dumping money into online misinformation/disinformation campaigns (EX: David Brock established &quot;correct the record&quot; - a Facebook group consisting of  paid internet trolls using fake accounts, with the intention of making it look like Clinton had more support than she did). Then 2016 showed us how vulnerable our culture is to manipulation from external sources (Yes i&#39;m talking about Russia influencing our election, which they absolutely did have their thumb on the scales with the whole Clinton email dirt, and leaks of DNC emails illustrating just how far the party had gone to suppress the popular candidate in favor of their chosen oligarch)\r<br><br><br><br><br>I can go on and on about the specific play by play of that particular election. but the major thematic lesson i learned through it was this: <br><br><br>Mainstream media was not ready to have competition, and the powers that be had not taken the internet seriously until it was too late. The presidential primary of 2015 served as the first indication that social media was a new battlefront for steering the popular narrative. so now we are seeing a massive increase in money and effort being put into influencing the public dialogue online. the really scary part is that it becomes harder and harder to decipher who is paying for the message, and what their intent is. is it the moneyed interests in our country scrambling to take back the narrative so they can continue to rule unquestioned? is it the external influence of hostile nations, stirring the pot of distrust in the american population for the purposes of destabilizing our global empire? or is it a bunch of four-chan internet trolls that decided to troll as many people as they can just for the lolz? since 2016 the internet essentially turned from the wild west, to a clash of the titans, and we as consumers need to start waking up to that fact, or we stand the chance of believing some absurd and very intentional manipulation.  <br><br><br>thanks for tackling this subject. it is a big fat nightmare.", "comment_date": "2019-03-31T19:51:09Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Mister Man", "comment_text": "This is a very interesting video series.

It&#39;s like a wall: it blocks certain attacks (ground based charges) with obvious ways to get around (fly or dig, but these two have special countermeasures and nobody expects a wall to block them) but also a factor of not changing: a single person can simply climb a wall using a ladder, provided nobody stops him or her before, same is true for simply grinding at the wall until there is a hole or throwing enough dust at it until there is a ramp.

I personally do not have any issues with VPN providers themselves, but merely the claim of them &quot;protecting your personal data&quot;.\r<br>Let me first explain how a VPN works and what its original use case was. As the name &quot;Virtual Private Network&quot; implies, its intended use case is to connect you (working from network A) to f.i. your work network (network B). It does so by creating an encrypted TCP/UDP connection to a network endpoint in network B, effectively tunneling your network A to the target network B. Therefore, data in transit from network A to network B is encrypted to the point of reaching network B. Hereon after, the data you send through the tunnel is present in unencrypted form.\r<br>For the purposes advertised, a VPN is nothing more than a glorified proxy: Whilst the data send by you to the VPN provider is encrypted, it is no longer the moment it reaches the providers endpoint. This endpoint is <b>not</b> the internet, but merely the VPN providers network. Here, the provider is free to do with your data as he pleases. Surely, he may just act as a proxy and not record any of the traffic going through your connection, but there is absolutely nothing hindering them from using your data for financial gain, logging it or even giving your data to the authorities (as happened before), albeit advertising differently. \r<br>Additionally, the data of a VPN user of a provider explicitly advertising as being for data privacy&#39;s sake is potentially much more valuable or interesting as that provider could (safely) assume the notion of that user being privacy conscious.\r<br>If you are concerned about tracking for marketing use, I have got other bad news for you: Your IP rarely is used for tracking purposes, simply because it is not a precise enough metric to track you as the user. Most users have multiple devices and many such devices share a single public IP address. To identify a user within acceptable margins of error, the IP address is insufficient and cookies or other metrics are significantly more reliable data points.\r<br>When evaluating the thought of a malicious VPN provider, using such a service suddenly becomes a significant security issue, given that a VPN provider - by definition - acts as a man in the middle. It is therefore at the VPN providers discretion to manipulate data being sent to you. In the best case scenario, this includes only ads, but could easily escalate to malicious software. Yes, with the ever increasing popularity of SSL, one might argue this to be not of too great a concern, but let me ask you: When was the last time you actually checked the CA issuing the certificate for the website you are accessing?", "comment_date": "2019-03-31T19:30:56Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Zero Control", "comment_text": "The only way to win this is demonetize YouTube completly and everyone that is worth the watch will have to ask for support by what ever means .

The argument that Google engineers are powerless to stop this, and that we really have to look in ourselves to be more loving to our fellow man, is one of the most cancerous arguments I&#39;ve heard. There are several solutions to this I have mentioned in my comment below.<br><br>I know some people who work for Google, they are nice people, but &quot;Nice&quot; doesn&#39;t apply to an algorithm. It is cold, mathematical, and exploitative. Google/YouTube is notorious for wanting to prevent you from seeing the content you are looking for (I cite the new Google search results versus the old PageRank results). Like you said, they want to get people to stay on the site for as long as possible. Part of that means serving up intentionally bad, misleading, distressing, low-quality videos so that someone is forced to scroll over them so they spend more time on the site. More clicks on videos, regardless of their quality or legitimacy, means happier advertisers and more revenue to YouTube. The content providers get a cut but the lion&#39;s share goes to YouTube itself. Advertisers have no recourse to even question Google about the legitimacy of this because click-farms will appear legitimate.<br><br>There are a multitude of solutions which if they actually considered, would resolve their problem:<br>1) Monetary block on newly uploaded videos which show stark contrast to previous content. In this case, everyone can see it went from Japanese gamer videos to American political videos. This can be done automatically with a separate Machine Learned algorithm<br>2) Monetary block on IP Addresses that originate from a IP laundering service like TOR or a VPN. Still allow upload of videos, just make users go through an extra step and talk to an actual human through e-mail. (And as always, the strictest DKIM/SPF rules in place to remove the possibilities of fake e-mails.)<br>3) Recognize some users as individuals who recognize good quality from bad quality based on the videos they watch. A person who watches all of these videos is clearly not a judge of quality. Use only actual clicks or search terms, not what the current flawed algorithm &quot;thinks&quot;. You can then tier the platform so that these individuals determine the rank of quality, from low, medium to high. If they try to exploit this, then it isn&#39;t a problem as you strike down the ability of that individual to recognize quality. <br>4) Hire a human.<br> _", "comment_date": "2019-03-31T19:28:24Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "VulpeculaJoy", "comment_text": "I use this super advanced filter called MY BRAIN to ignore stuff like this and mostly adhere to a &quot;no-clickbait-policy&quot;. <br>And I think everyone should do that.", "comment_date": "2019-03-31T19:28:17Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Enkhe Darmaev", "comment_text": "let&#39;s also talk about millions of the weirdest videos for kids<br>they are using the same tools", "comment_date": "2019-03-31T19:28:13Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Christopher Fowler", "comment_text": "The problem comes where there <i>are</i> gatekeepers.

What about some form of moderated community.  In the Usenet days there were moderated news groups, and of course the free for all unmoderated groups.  It was my impression that the moderated groups were much better if one wanted to hold on-topic discussions, and not be subject to flame wars and trolling.  That\u2019s my point with the Stephen Covey quote; there must be a community that cares enough to want to act as moderators, or guardians of itself.  It does not have to be overly controlling either.  I believe that when a group of people that are motivated by a common interest are given the opportunity to gather on a platform in service of their own goals, great things will happen.  Wikipedia is a shining example of how this may work.  I do think that it would have to be at a finer level of granularity than the current algorithmic style controls favored by YouTube - which is clearly not working all that well.  I suggest that a YouTube community on a specific topic would have many creator-members, that set it\u2019s own community policy, and is moderated by a community forum, potentially using algorithmic tools.  I know I\u2019m rather vague on exactly how this will work, but I think that it will only be possible to create communities, if there is some form of community structure, i.e., control over community standards must be decentralized to the community of interest level, rather than controlled by a centralized bot-farm, that is trying to fight off other bot-farms that are attacking it.", "comment_date": "2019-03-31T19:26:46Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "wolvenar", "comment_text": "I see a deficiency in your arguments in this video.

The point you make that much of it is financially motivated is really good. And I agree with your point that basic improvement of individuals respect and diligence when hearing information online certainly helps, and maybe a shift in culture can largely be the solution. But I do wonder if other things can be done.<br>For example I have some thoughts on the current ad-revenue model of the internet: While as you say, Youtube isn&#39;t directly at fault (it&#39;s the people doing the bad stuff at the end of the day), these people&#39;s goal is not necessarily malice, but greed, which is enabled by the pay per view/engagement model which Youtube uses. In addition these polarizing political videos, there is so much of Youtube which is based on low quality or click bait. (To be fair, there is no perfect system and the amount of genuinely amazing, high quality content on this site does sort of blow my mind.) <br>Supporting creators directly in some ways helps combat this, as the money goes to videos which individuals consider to be high quality content, and avoid paying cheap click bait models, which hopefully would tend away from polarizing and inaccurate information which is so damaging to society (as well as cleaning up a lot of general garbage imho..). <br>But I don&#39;t think this payment model alone is a silver bullet or perfect solution, as while tiny self supported communities can be good, it can sometimes lead into some strange echo chambers, where the incentive is almost to alienate the viewers from regular society in order to fully capture their attention and revenue. (basically modern online cults lol) Still, I think your channel and other do benefit from having some reduced incentive to simply the Youtube algorithm (all hail the might algorithm) and have some additional incentives which hopefully help reward better videos. <br>Anyhow rambling aside, appreciate the covering of this general topic, I think it is really important to discuss now.", "comment_date": "2019-03-31T19:15:06Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "nikolaos stavrou", "comment_text": "Its all in the name of money manipulation  and control.", "comment_date": "2019-03-31T19:14:52Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "farmerdave33", "comment_text": "One of the more important topics in our society today.", "comment_date": "2019-03-31T19:14:51Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Scott McCall", "comment_text": "Wow awesome video", "comment_date": "2019-03-31T19:14:42Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Arron Powell", "comment_text": "Thank you for doing this.

As far as the typical YouTube audience member knows, that system is just used to enforce copyright if someone uses someone else&#39;s footage without permission. But, if all this content is coming from the SAME source, they&#39;re not going to enforce any take-downs of their own content, even if the system DOES notice all the duplicate videos on different channels.<br>SO, presumably, it&#39;s actually an anti-spam thing, where YouTube would do its OWN take-down of the videos, knowing that they are all exactly the same, and therefore... what? Why exactly is it bad for there to be more than one copy of the same video on YouTube? Exactly what rule do they have against it? I just don&#39;t think you made that particularly clear.<br>Because, it looks like most of those videos were using the exact same title and thumbnail. (As we can see at <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1PGm8LslEb4&amp;t=11m04s\">11:04</a>) Is it NOT built into YouTube&#39;s systems to detect video duplicates THAT way?<br>Oh, also, you talk about how it can be very subversive and difficult to detect all of this. But why is that? Presumably, the spammers are using the same bot accounts to watch and &quot;like&quot; all the videos that they do. Even if disguised amongst a deluge of also &quot;liking&quot; normal videos, surely a pattern would develop where accounts that associate with known spam content, early on, could easily be flagged as potential bot accounts?<br>Agh, I don&#39;t even know what I&#39;m asking anymore.<br>Overall though, very interesting, very well made video.", "comment_date": "2019-03-31T19:14:02Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "TheOxanian", "comment_text": "It&#39;s weird that we have to use VPN in order to stay private.", "comment_date": "2019-03-31T19:14:01Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "MD Fish Tanks", "comment_text": "Destin.

However, it&#39;s not entirely our human nature which enables this type of content to be a problem - the infrastructure which social media &amp; YouTube in particular has built, one of click bait and sensationalism, encourages this type of content. It seems like the natural evolution of content creation. Given the success clauses of the algorithm e.g. click through, heated commenting &amp; engagement, watch time, metadata overlap etc... content creation has moved from people becoming good at working the algorithm to computers becoming good at working the algorithm. Only problem is computers are much better at this and can automatically produce way more than we&#39;ve thought to handle. It&#39;s difficult though, as those success clauses are the only way to assess a video &amp; finding artificially inflated numbers is incredibly tricky. <br><br>Really, what I&#39;m saying is that is the algorithm didn&#39;t so actively encourage this type of content, and discourage the older, more quality content, then there wouldn&#39;t be such incentive to make these videos. It&#39;s analogous to poaching - a lot of poachers do what they do because it&#39;s the most profitable &amp; sometimes only real income source for them. If you give alternative income sources, the rates of poaching decline. If you create an environment which disincentives poaching as a means for income, poaching decreases. If you create an environment which incentivises divisive content as a means of great income, divisive content increases. It&#39;s an effect of the digital environment that&#39;s been created. <br><br>It seems like a hole the social media giants have dug for themselves out of greed and, as always, we the consumer are the ones being exploited.", "comment_date": "2019-03-31T18:47:38Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "SullivanWorkshops", "comment_text": "This is the same problem the video game industry has with hacking and cheats.", "comment_date": "2019-03-31T18:47:32Z", "likes_count": 2}, {"comment_by": "Live Free", "comment_text": "This reminds me of PC Principle on South Park and his daughter is an Advertisement tool for Mdeia companies wanting views for monetization.", "comment_date": "2019-03-31T18:47:26Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "AMAN BAGMARE", "comment_text": "U just blew my mind", "comment_date": "2019-03-31T18:47:26Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Will R", "comment_text": "This is the moment I\u2019ve beeen waiting foooor !!!", "comment_date": "2019-03-31T18:47:14Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Matthew Baker", "comment_text": "Awesome content.
