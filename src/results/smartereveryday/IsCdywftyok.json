I would like to point out that ..<br><br>It&#39;s not that manufacturers don&#39;t record the proper flex, it&#39;s that each flex is calculated differently based on the type of stick. For example, a midpoint flex stick should be expected to flex like you graphed out. A stick that is designed to flex lower (low-point flex) on the shaft will flex differently if measured in the middle. Some sticks are designed to be strong on one side and weak on another. There&#39;s a lot of engineering that goes into this. Some stick makers might base their flex rating off of the &quot;broken-in&quot; period (the period where the stick will exhibit that flex the longest), others might base it on the brand-new period with no break-in.<br><br>Also, with hockey equipment, there is no real standardized measurements. Which is partly why you saw different flexes. Each manufacturer tends to measure things slightly different. This shows up most in goalie gear, where a 26&quot; paddle stick in one maker is a 28.5&quot; in another. Same goes for skate/pad sizing.<br><br>I&#39;ve seen high-speed slapshot videos before, so I wouldn&#39;t mind seeing you do the opposite of the equation. The energy that a goalie (full disclosure, I&#39;ve been a hockey goalie for 22 years) faces and that his equipment must disperse. I don&#39;t think anyone has done that. There&#39;s long been the saying of a shot feeling &quot;harder&quot; than a comparable shot traveling at a higher speed. I wouldn&#39;t mind seeing if it boils down to rotation of the puck, angle of impact (complete edge versus corner edge), or another parameter.

Older sticks and mid kick point sticks use the middle of the stick to determine the flex number, whereas the Low kick point sticks are more towards the bottom. The &quot;lowness&quot; is dependent on the brand, as some are lower than others. For example the stick he used was a Warrior Covert DT1 which has a super low kick point. so you may notice the stick really doesn&#39;t flex in the middle, the bottom flings the puck. Mid kick sticks are preferred by slap shot takers because when the stick flexes in the middle the is more surface area to build up potential energy, causing more kick pack once the contact is made, increasing speed and power.\u00a0", "comment_date": "2014-08-01T04:48:34Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "pj Barreras", "comment_text": "Hey there I watch your videos all the time to boost my knowledge haha but not until this video came up did I know u don&#39;t love to far from me haha but keep posting awesome stuff it makes my day to learn something new", "comment_date": "2014-07-12T20:17:57Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Bobert 2710", "comment_text": "Awesome stuff", "comment_date": "2014-07-12T14:31:37Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "ryanrock7627", "comment_text": "Add I the only one that watch the puck getting smashed more than one time ", "comment_date": "2014-07-10T08:34:06Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Lenox Zav", "comment_text": "AHHHHHHHHHH confusing math", "comment_date": "2014-07-05T06:20:03Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Badmouthbandit", "comment_text": "More hockey! :) ", "comment_date": "2014-06-30T07:26:02Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "The milk man", "comment_text": "Awesome science behind the best sport in the world!", "comment_date": "2014-06-18T10:16:13Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Fali Akuna", "comment_text": "One sure thing: I&#39;ll never let you use my stuff for experiments.
