dependent upon the relationship between density for a fluid medium in which they are propagated and kinetic entropy inherent to it.<br><br>Because the rotating masses you employed in your experiment are initially propagated as lenticular discs in a fluid which are relatively stable, yet nonetheless undergo metamorphosis to become annular vortices consequent to collision, it seems to substantiate the likelihood that precession is involved.<br><br>That the aforementioned collision results in additional and evidently increasingly complex sequences of vortices may be instigated and/or amplified by slight cumulative increase to pressure and velocity for fluid present between the colliding vortices resulting in precession due to dynamic effects consequent to diametrically opposed impact of two relatively flat &#39;pseudo surfaces&#39;.<br><br>If the centre of the disc shaped vortices were not the same thickness as their perimeter that could also result in additional lateral acceleration impinging upon intervening fluid and result in precession for the vortices.<br><br>It is possible resultant interactions between the fluid and the vortices may not be torque-free however because vectors for the initial vortices were juxtaposed on the axes aligned with direction of travel.<br><br>Evidently some effect imparts subsequent change, possibly due to lateral dissipation of the aforementioned pressure increase resulting in friction occurring between the intervening fluid acquiring a dynamic lateral vector and the vortices.<br><br>It would be very interesting to observe repetition for the experiment using fluids of varying density and propagation of vortices with diverse rotational characteristics such as two or more whirlpools emulating black holes, although that may only be possible subject to neutral gravity.<br><br>The patterns are as beautiful as they are fascinating!", "comment_date": "2022-08-14T06:53:57Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by":

In this interpretation, my guess is that the energy between the 2 peripheral waves and the primary one are nearly equal so as to create a secondary vortex, so I would expect that we could mathematically tie together 1) the distance from the primary vortex initiation point to the secondary vortices initiation points, 2) the spacing between each secondary vortices, and 3) the energy dissipation along the primary vortex (so something to the power of 2 since it appears mostly 2 dimensional). <br>Would be curious to know your thoughts.", "comment_date": "2022-07-04T19:28:51Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "jago juice", "comment_text": "can u somehow sell this as a house decoration and make it go off on a timer or press that would be great ;)", "comment_date": "2022-07-04T01:29:07Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "OMF-Arch", "comment_text": "This looks like how Nebula from dead stars would behave, very beautiful I&#39;m still here in 2022, had to get my English fixed .", "comment_date": "2022-07-04T00:51:59Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Dr. Avocado", "comment_text": ":)", "comment_date": "2022-07-03T16:53:04Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Enderjeff 29", "comment_text": "<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVbdbVhzcM4&amp;t=4m21s\">4:21</a> is when the magic starts", "comment_date": "2022-07-02T18:41:32Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Noctiss_Season2", "comment_text": "come on, we all know this is just aperture science doing first step tests in trying to make the portal guns", "comment_date": "2022-07-02T13:40:13Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Spider.Science", "comment_text": "\ud765\ubbf8\ub86d\uace0 \uc544\ub984\ub2f5\ub124\uc694!", "comment_date": "2022-06-29T17:02:10Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Jake Thomas", "comment_text": "Yes.

If atomic particles are toroidal vortex rings in an aether medium then you can see how colliding atomic particle vortices makes other smaller atomic particle vortices... which are NOT constituent parts but energy reformed (conserved) into smaller vortices. When considering particle vortex theory you need to remember some important facts. Firstly the atomic particle vortex has a secondary plane of rotation - so it not only turns in on itself like these vortices but they also rim turn clockwise or counterclockwise - this differentiates between vortices making them either positive (charge) or negative (charge). So the difference between an electron vortex and a positron vortex is simply this secondary wheel rotation in relation to the primary inward rotation that creates the toroid. So if you want to model a particle vortex you have to add this secondary rotational phase either to the vortex as a whole or causing the toroidal element to twist slightly.  Secondly the aether medium in which atomic vortices exist is massless and can therefore move at the speed of light which is the speed of time and existence so thirdly the aether can move so quickly that it prevents an area of low pressure (or high pressure) from ever actually forming - so the pressure value of the aether can never change it is always constant even within a particle vortex. This gives the aether  a &#39;rigid&#39; quality which allows it to carry waves which we know as the EMR spectrum and also gravity. But those potential waves (the movement of the aether)  move so quickly that they never actually change the pressure of the medium so never really exist unless they interact with a particle vortex. Magnetic fields are also toroidal vortices caused by the toroidal motion of the aether on large scales. This motion however does not seem to affect other magnetic fields... as the aether is massless it can move in two directions at the same time and pass through itself with out any effect, like two converging waves. The aether is not moving fast enough to interact with itself, but particle vortices are rotating at the speed of light which appears to change things and of course if you place a particle toroidal vortex with a magnetic field toroidal vortex the particle vortex is affected in its direction of travel.  If nothing moves fast enough it becomes something.", "comment_date": "2022-05-06T12:10:08Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Vivallamannen", "comment_text": "shouldve added some flakes(?) like in a snow globe in the water to see motion better.", "comment_date": "2022-05-06T12:07:58Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "ccc", "comment_text": "3 years of work for a 8 minute video", "comment_date": "2022-05-06T11:34:59Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Tapas Dave", "comment_text": "Can we relate this with big bang theory?", "comment_date": "2022-05-06T10:05:58Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Friday Azures", "comment_text": "Now Capcom just needs to update street fighter Ken and Ryu&#39;s hadouken", "comment_date": "2022-05-06T06:10:34Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Harsono Ng", "comment_text": "What is it use for ?", "comment_date": "2022-05-06T03:29:27Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "James", "comment_text": "What if the speed from the secenderies was accelerated so fast it caused the 2 vortex to combine their speed creating a 90\u00b0 turn.", "comment_date": "2022-05-06T03:00:57Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Justin Goodwyn", "comment_text": "I\u2019m too intimidated to start writing a 10 page research paper due tomorrow at <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVbdbVhzcM4&amp;t=3m30s\">3:30</a>p", "comment_date": "2022-05-06T00:41:22Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Renato Ramos", "comment_text": "It&#39;s the seizure procedure.", "comment_date": "2022-05-05T22:42:32Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Sam Stone", "comment_text": "awesome vid", "comment_date": "2022-05-05T21:29:37Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "K K Peru", "comment_text": "Anybody else think Goku vs. Vegeta or Voldemort vs. Harry when you saw this thumbnail?", "comment_date": "2022-05-05T21:02:02Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Method2Madness", "comment_text": "so much wasted water", "comment_date": "2022-05-05T20:53:33Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Alan Alves", "comment_text": "The music sounds like Bruno.", "comment_date": "2022-05-05T19:55:08Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Catseye189", "comment_text": "Twin cores...", "comment_date": "2022-05-05T18:33:51Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Man Delorean", "comment_text": "Jesus.. 10 million subs...

After impact, each ring takes over half the burrowing, the two colours together continuing until they lose the angular momentum to maintain cohesion, bloom, and are again inflated by the water dragged in the ink&#39;s wake, creating little rings. That&#39;s why the rings in the failed attempts sometimes swallow their partner : stronger angular momentum in one ring.

The best example I can think of would be pushing a small rubber ball into another small rubber ball, though theoretically when centered perfectly they would simply move in one direction, experimentally we know that it is nearly impossible to center anything perfectly. So, when this sort of experiment occurs, one of the balls will rotate around the other, so it will turn and move sideways. But what if the ball were cylindrical? But more like a penny than a Pringles container. If the rounded edge tends to rotate out of the way, that means that the flat edge would then be facing the pushing force directly, and flat objects don&#39;t tend to rotate when pushed by another flat object or force. In any case, this could be something, it could be nothing, but if you&#39;re still interested in figuring out why this works, maybe it is a hypothesis to look into. <br><br>Thanks for reading,", "comment_date": "2021-03-31T22:12:59Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "the Duncan's fam channel", "comment_text": "Hey I&#39;m hoping you will do a honest look at the moon footage", "comment_date": "2021-03-29T02:59:14Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "\u5b8b\u79c9\u94a7", "comment_text": "I LOVE the  video", "comment_date": "2021-03-23T04:37:22Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Felix Schmitz", "comment_text": "Respect.", "comment_date": "2021-03-19T18:44:57Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Jason Cheng", "comment_text": "The old swallow really squash because chimpanzee acly settle after a purring blood. young, sore structure", "comment_date": "2021-03-18T17:10:31Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Mary Lagua", "comment_text": "Very pretty \ud83e\udd29", "comment_date": "2021-03-14T20:31:13Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "i4qx_", "comment_text": "revisit this", "comment_date": "2021-03-12T20:30:43Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Nelson Martinez", "comment_text": "Hey, what if you guys did 4 instead of 2?", "comment_date": "2021-03-12T19:22:19Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Daniele Poddighe", "comment_text": "you need to check the Evideon teory of Corrado Malanga, where the universe is a toroidal fractal", "comment_date": "2021-03-08T20:50:12Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Tyler Levy", "comment_text": "The sloppy headline pathomorphologically imagine because revolve biomechanically trot out a lewd shade. shrill, alcoholic jogging", "comment_date": "2021-03-06T07:12:11Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Preston Britton", "comment_text": "The obsolete boot enzymatically judge because input systemically regret past a fallacious saxophone. envious, shallow japanese", "comment_date": "2021-03-05T22:14:45Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "abhay patil", "comment_text": "That&#39;s awesome", "comment_date": "2021-03-05T08:46:42Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Abhinav Mishra", "comment_text": "Its like jujutsu kaisen gojo&#39;s hollow purple.", "comment_date": "2021-03-04T11:30:08Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "19cosmo91", "comment_text": "I wonder what Abbott and Costello would have to \u2b55 about this", "comment_date": "2021-03-03T10:01:18Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Deneigh", "comment_text": "Destin, this is fabulous!

Now to test this theory I would need to go watch your 12 hours of footage and find every time it happens. But here it is. <br>I haven&#39;t watched the video that much and have just contemplated the idea so you have probably already thought through it. But even with a close to perfectly similar velocity of the shots, there is always one that is stronger than the other. That causes a whip around effet on the lesser of the two colors. At <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVbdbVhzcM4&amp;t=6m38s\">6:38</a> the pink is the stronger and the blue is the lesser. This difference in the strengths causes a difference in the speed of the water as it rushes back in to fill the void left behind the secondary rings before they form. As you can see it turns 90 degrees before it turns into a secondary miniature ring. Now for the second part. Again nature doesn&#39;t like voids. So the bubbles of color that are about to turn into secondary rings are where water is having to replace the void the fastest. So now that it is slowing down the center of the bubble was where the strongest push was happening. So clear water rushes in pushing away the color that was previously in the middle and thus causing them to form rings. So my hypothesis is that the secondary rings are a result of the water rushing in to fill the void caused by the color taking up and leaving that zone.<br><br>So. at <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVbdbVhzcM4&amp;t=6m38s\">6:38</a> based on my hypothesis. Because blue is the weaker of the two it is going to have a fast speed on the fringe of the ring. Meaning water will be rushing in from the pink side to replace the faster blue side turning the bubble where the blue is primarily on the outside and pink on the inside. Then once it has turned the water continues to fill the void left by the center and cause the color bubbles to be pushed out and into an almost perfect ring.", "comment_date": "2020-12-16T02:09:07Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Dennis G.", "comment_text": "What would 4 of them look like.

However, the foreword momentum of those particles isn\u2019t lost. So, when the path of least resistance is no longer radially outward from the original collision, the particles attempt to continue moving parallel to the original path. However, since more and more particles accumulate within this low pressure zone, the zone rapidly increases pressure until it implodes and creates the second rings. The rings are perpendicular to the original collision plane because they\u2019re at farthest point their radial momentum could carry them. The implosion cannot create new momentum along the original collision plane or else the ring would continue radially in a strobing manner. Thus the momentum that is consolidated thanks the the implosion is dispersed in the direction of least resistance, which is perpendicular to the original collision\u2019s plane. <br><br>The reason the implosion creates a second ring is due to the dynamic pressure in the center of the originally low pressure zone. The point with the lowest pressure will spike to a local high, before dispersing once again. However, just before it dispersed again it is still attracting particles, thus there is a evenly dispersed build up of kinetic and potential energy around the center point of the second ring that could be visualized as a sine wave.. maybe. <br><br>I\u2019m a mechanical engineer undergrad and don\u2019t have a really good grasp of fluid mechanics yet.

The vortex is created due to an injection of flow into a standing medium and friction from the standing medium induces the flow to rotate.  This is why the vortex rotates the way it does forward in the center and reversed on the outside.  The vortex also creates a low pressure zone just behind it pulling the medium with it.  By aiming the two vortexes at each other you are trapping them in a single standing wave of sorts.  As the pressure waves move towards each other they create a high pressure zone between the vortexes that expands the rings while halting their forward momentum.  perturbations in the flow of the medium escaping from in between the two planes strengthen the vortexes in some places and begin to create nodes in the vortex.  When the pressure differential equalizes is when your ringlets are formed and I think they are formed by the same process that formed your original vortex.  The medium following the nodes is moving faster than the surrounding medium.  When the vortexes collapse the momentum trapped in the wake of the more powerful nodes continues and pushes forward.  The remaining pressure differentials found in the wake of these nodes cause a small puff of flow into the standing medium which creates your ringlets at 90* from the wave propagation.  You can actually see the reversal of the standing wave at <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVbdbVhzcM4&amp;t=6m28s\">6:28</a> as the rings starts to pull back in the weaker flow zones while the nodes continue forward now sucking up dye from the weaker zones and collecting dye from the center of the disk towards the wake of the stronger nodes.  Looking at the node most inline with the center at <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVbdbVhzcM4&amp;t=6m45s\">6:45</a> you can see that the nodes are no longer rotating with the vortexes but are now moving forward as a single flow and by <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVbdbVhzcM4&amp;t=6m46s\">6:46</a> that flow has propagated into its own new vortex powered by the mass following the node.

These phenomenon aren&#39;t unlike the things I research related to pulsed electrical currents of extremely short impulse duration (less than 1ms) generated by disruptive discharge. I&#39;ve recently been studying Electric Double layer Capacitors, then electric double layers in plasma, and that lead me to discover Birkeland current-- which is identical to the type of motion in the subsidiary rings produced in these collisions. Notice how the small ring is turning in on itself, but the electrical conditions of charge separation due to ionization produces an &#39;orbiting&#39; spiral chasing around the ring... at least, I think this is the summary of the case.<br>I admit, I only just fell onto these connections tonight, but my research in pulsed currents clearly relates, so I knew the significance it should hold is great.

Density and temperature obviously were key issues.  So if, for example, the pigment in one color weighed more than that in the other it would affect the outcome and prevent symmetrical contact.  But changing the temperature, and thus the water density, of the whole set-up might also affect the geometry of the outcome.  Is the number of right-angle circles always the same?<br><br>One issue I would ask if y&#39;all considered is the compression of the clear water in the boundary layer between the two spheroids.  It looks to me like that would be the fastest moving part of the contact zone, which would create a low-pressure area that is inherently unstable as it is both spreading out and having to expand radially.  I would bet that the water in that boundary layer resists slowing, which would tend to thin the boundary layer.  But it would be very difficult to maintain a laminar flow that is radially uniform.  That is stream of consciousness, so it may not make sense.<br><br>This would be interesting to try with liquids the molecules of which were not dipoles.

The ball will continue traveling endlessly in one direction.

I was thinking about something like surface tension.<br>Due to the potential coming from different colorant concentrations in different places in this space there are different tensions.<br>This force might be strong enough, so that after the big ring collapses (from the first vortex), the colorant reaccumulates and then travels in form of another vortex ring due to the motion.", "comment_date": "2019-05-17T08:23:50Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "onlyonedeebo", "comment_text": "I love the message in this video.", "comment_date": "2019-05-17T05:52:35Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "EpicOdin", "comment_text": "My best bet is it\u2019s a constructive wave pattern thing with or something. The plasmas collide at different speed and energy, with equal mass, and react in a way I would vaguely compare to a water droplet. <br><br>^<br>|<br>|<br>    I have a feeling that if I looked up how the water droplet science worked, it would work like that. <br><br>OBSERVATIONS: <br><br>The plasma balls have to be equal mass when they collide, but don\u2019t need to be going at the same speed or energy, necessarily. <br><br>When the plasmas are shot through the water, they will act as a wave would work. The plasma is moving against and around the water, and when the two collide, they will essentially push the water passing around them into the center of the force, and spread out to form a ring. <br><br>Their individual waves, like I said before, interfere (add on top at different speeds/energys) with each other and set a NEW wave pattern to create circles. The collision cause them to split the circle into individual, fairly evenly spaced, wave patterns. When this ring starts to make the little rings, it thins out the bigger it gets. That means these uneven waves will split apart the ring where the waves are weak, and the reaction will make the stronger waves sustain their structure with the water and create little, evenly spaced balls of plasma to spread out. They will react like a water droplet, as the wave\u2019s energy sucks the matter in with its current, and roll outwards until they lose speed against the force of the water.<br><br>and density of the plasma could play a good role too in how it travels thru the water in a solid form, kinda how it thinly spreads and lingers in the water the way it does. Also note that the plasmas do not mix, and there is water spaced in between them to separate. This happens most likely because of density, and gives a good layer of structure around the plasmas. <br><br>Those are my observations lmao I am in high school but that\u2019s my best interpretation of waver wave science. \ud83d\ude02", "comment_date": "2019-05-17T05:46:59Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "ShushLabs", "comment_text": "its beyond me how can be nearly 5k idiots that dislike this ...", "comment_date": "2019-05-16T19:33:52Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Alecxander", "comment_text": "Evacuate the world of science engage all defences and get this man a nobel", "comment_date": "2019-05-16T13:53:54Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "amehel0", "comment_text": "Now explain karmen vortex and its uses.", "comment_date": "2019-05-16T10:03:09Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Western Adventures", "comment_text": "neat", "comment_date": "2019-05-16T08:10:48Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "lucas simioni", "comment_text": "Laminar flow", "comment_date": "2019-05-16T03:00:34Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Life Long K-Kick", "comment_text": "this guy is one of the best people on EARTH........      true story", "comment_date": "2019-05-16T01:11:18Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Josh Jonathan", "comment_text": "The music was a perfect fit.", "comment_date": "2019-05-15T21:28:33Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Skie Dragon", "comment_text": "sure ill start a sub to this vid", "comment_date": "2019-05-15T17:12:24Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "GrowOZ", "comment_text": "Satisfaction is real", "comment_date": "2019-05-15T11:37:33Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "C R", "comment_text": "LDS?", "comment_date": "2019-05-15T03:26:08Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Barry Green", "comment_text": "some conservation of angular momentum happening?", "comment_date": "2019-05-14T20:21:50Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Justin Williamson", "comment_text": "Beautiful!

It&#39;s about the simplest answer in the world -&gt; fluid dynamics. The Coriolis Effect... as fluid is pulled into a vacuum it moves toward the center bending to the right. When fluid is pushed from a high pressure it moves outward bending to the right. This is how we find high and low pressure zones in the atmosphere taking shape. So if you picture, as you said, the low pressure zones in the big outer ring pulled the ring apart into segments, and zoom into 1 such segment, the center of it is the point of lowest pressure, pulling the fluid from either side in. This draws in from opposing directions but due to the Coriolis Effect each side bends to it&#39;s respective right hand side. This results in a swirling motion around the center. The orientation of what is top, bottom, left and right is based on fluid dynamics also. The water outside the rings is relatively stable, unmoving, creating a ceiling. In fluid dynamics the lowest pressure is where the fluid is moving the fastest. Conversely, the highest pressure is where the fluid is moving the slowest. So stable water is like a virtual wall, in this case ceiling. The outward force of the large inner circle expending is a higher pressure zone because it&#39;s pushing outward from the center, effectively creating a floor. So given the orientation of ceiling and floor, you can logically deduce what is left and right relative to the moving fluid in the zone between them... Effectively forcing the small rings to rotate perpendicular.", "comment_date": "2019-05-09T21:40:47Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Anomaly's Hobbies", "comment_text": "Ha ha!

Also intriguing, I imagine, to mathematicians and physicists as well as engineers and inventors. I&#39;m particularly intrigued by Arnold Anderson&#39;s suggestion that your experiments might generate only prime nos. of secondary vortices. Your work reminds me  of the work of my\u00a0father (Winfield W. Salisbury, 1903-1999), who was all four of the things I just mentioned (though math was of interest only sofar as it served the other three). He told me once-<del>maybe he tried this; I never did-</del> that if you have a big barrel open at one end, and fasten inside it a closed cylinder, concentric to the barrel, then whack the back of the barrel, you can create an (invisible) vortex of air that can knock someone down 10 or 20 (or more?) feet away. Dad worked on two big ideas in his later life: fusion power, and gravity. He had, at my count, 6 or 7 ideas (each better than the last) to make fusion a usable energy source. The last one he called &quot;spiral fusion.&quot; Apparently he figured out how to make a ball-lightning generator (he surmised, or calculated, I don&#39;t know which, that &quot;ball&quot; lightning [a misnomer] can be modeled by a new solution to Maxwell&#39;s equations); the balls created are actually toroids or vortices. His scheme, basically, was to generate two charged vortices of deuterium/lithium plasma, spinning in opposite orientations (one clockwise, one anticlockwise) and slam them together with enough energy to start fusion; of course everything would be very tightly and strongly controlled by ultrastrong magnetic fields so that 1) the vortices or toroids would move very fast and with very precise aim, and 2) the energy released by fusion could be contained and channeled to do work. Though his early efforts in this arena became concrete first at Zenith Radio in the &#39;50s, then at Occidental Petroleum in the &#39;70s, neither those nor later such projects were carried to completion. If you&#39;re intrigued enough by this account to look into his work, you could check out two articles about gravity he published in &quot;Nature,&quot; on 11/22/69, describing a lab experiment to generate gravity waves; and sometime in January 1974, in which he proved, from Special Relativity and using elementary math, the existence of a secondary gravitational field (analogous to magnetic fielda as a secondary to electric fielda), repulsive in this thought experiment, which he dubbed the &quot;gyron&quot; field or force. For reasons that still baffle me, the latter article attracted very little notice, and that, from experts in General Relativity, negative. A broader account of Dad&#39;s work can be found on the website of Southwest Museum of Engineering, Communications and Computation (SMECC).", "comment_date": "2019-05-06T00:31:54Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Scott K", "comment_text": "This is truly awesome!", "comment_date": "2019-05-05T23:39:32Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Takoda", "comment_text": "Just convinced me to change my degree to engineering.

I love it.<br>What i noticed is that the large initial ring that is formulated in the first stage of the collision, i&#39;m guessing is has a (fixed?) amount of kinks, where it breaks up into smaller sections. And the reason the form circles is because of the outward motion produced at the time of impact. The outward Motion, causes the small circles to form for three reasons. First, the forces on either side of the collision are balanced, second the low preassure &#39;kinks&#39; in the circle break the larger circle breaks and third because the forces on either side are balanced, this forces the outward moving (initially &#39;balls&#39;) of colour to take the most efficient state againts the outward motion, thus taking the form of the original rings fired out the &#39;canons&#39;.

I can see what&#39;s happening in this one. When two vortices of opposite rotation come together, they attract each other and annihilate, because the vorticity will sum to zero. Once the rotation stops, there is nothing but a low pressure center without motion, and so at that point, it radiates outward like a regular pressure wave. It is easiest to see with a surface vortex (two whirpools). When opposite whirlpools come together, they annihilate and it radiates outward as a travelling surface wave. The whirlpools are non-dissipative waves, and the travelling surface wave is a dissipative wave. The vortex rings in this cool video are annihilating just like whirlpools annihilate on the surface. <br><br>A vortex has a center line called the vortex axis or vortex core. Right at the axis, rotational velocity is very great. A whirpool has a vortex axis that ends above the water. A vortex ring has a vortex axis that makes a complete circle, (ring). The rotational motion is about that ring. If you examine a small volume right at the vortex  axis, you will see that the ring is being stretched outward by that rotation. The  fluid is still rotating about the ring axis, as they meet (because angular momentum is conserved for each ring). So the fluid in the middle of the rings is pushing against the fluid from the opposite ring, and also rotating about the ring axis, and so the net motion is outward. As the ring stretches outward, the angular velocity around the axis goes way way up, just like a tornado angular velocity goes way up when it is pulled upward, or a button on a string toy goes fast when it is pulled tight. <br><br>Then the cool part happens when the vortex axes actually meet. When they are very close, there is an attractive force between the axes. They are rotating like matching gears. Fluid right that is rotating one axis can just as easily rotate around the other. Right when that happens,  it is just like the whirlpools on the surface. Fluid crosses over between the vortex axes and the rotation sums to zero and you get a radiant pressure wave outward. But right at the boundary where those ring axes are meeting, you will find that there is an outward flow right between them, right at the line where they touch, and an inward flow on the far sides. And so there is a rotation about a new axis, of exactly the same type that created the original vortices.<br><br>Now the obvious question is why it breaks up into rings, because it would appear to have symmetry at the boundary. So you would naturally ask why it wouldn&#39;t continue to spread outward without breaking up. My first though when I saw it was that I was looking at a quantization. There were already present on the rings secondary waves called Kelvin waves that transverse the rings, that were not very easy to see at first. When they came together, those Kelvin waves were superimposed and there was an interference pattern between them. The constructive peaks of that interference pattern formed the places where the axis first merged, and the troughs of that pattern formed the places where it merged more slowly. And so the inward and outward flow at the boundary was broken up in such a way that at periodic intervals, there was also a small inward flow at the inside of the boundary. When that inward flow became sufficiently large, that forms a complete toroid of flow (a new vortex ring). But that doesn&#39;t happen immediately. The spreading of the ring has to reach a certain distance. I am guessing that distance is the point at which the interference pattern of the Kelvin waves is close in size to the rotation about the vortex axes. <br><br>Thanks for making this video, truly great work.

The white jackets would also then bump into other white jackets around them, clustering together (from being pushed together) and the colored jackets would eventually outpace them and run/wrap around the clusters of the white jackets. This would create then white jackets in balls/clusters and colored jackets rushing around them on either side. If we do this in 3 dimensions with fluid it creates these donuts.

As a disc golfer, I understand that if a rotating disc hits something, it&#39;s angular momentum has a significant impact on the direction of the resulting trajectory. Discs often do very weird things if they hit at low angles. Head-on, they simply tend to drop, and don&#39;t deviate much compared to if they weren&#39;t rotating - because all the energy is dissipated forward into the solid object, rather than being deflected.<br><br>In your beautiful experiment here, what we&#39;re seeing is the total angular momentum being preserved beyond the head-on collision, because there is no solid object for that energy to dissipate into. It is retained in the new 2-part disc until the expansion speed drops to a point where the angular momentum can express itself again - as it no longer feels like a head-on collision.<br><br>What I want to see is how much rotation each part of the 2-part disc has - because it seems to me that the collision forms two counter-rotating discs with a static boundary layer between them, and it&#39;s this counter rotation which triggers the formation of the multiple vortexes perpendicular to the disc which formed them. <br><br>If each side of the 2-part disc spun the same way, then we&#39;d simply see an expanding disc.<br><br>It must be the interaction of the static boundary layer, the counter-rotating discs, and the velocity of the fluids, and the viscosity of them that are the controls.", "comment_date": "2019-02-03T00:05:19Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "AceJayce", "comment_text": "Science can be awesome - and gorgeous too<br>And it hit me - how would this works on zero G?

In both cases there are two parallel vortices, curved in this case and straight in contrails.  Small perturbations along the rings lead to larger instabilities which eventually pinch and bring the vortices closer together and eventually joining to form smaller vortex rings.  For the most part, vorticity conservation is maintained where the sum of the vorticity of the small rings is very close to the vorticity of the two original rings.   Some vorticity is extracted through turbulence which is the cascade of the seemingly larger swirls breaking into smaller swirls.

I have an idea for a lifting force machine. <br>Step 1: Get hollowed out cube.<br>Step 2: Securely attach magnet to inner bottom of hollowed out cube.<br>Step 3: Place a lever on inside bottom of cube behind the magnet thats securely attached to inside bottom of cube so that one side of the lever is pointing towards you and hanging over the magnet.<br>Step 4: Attach a vertical bar to the top side of the part of the lever that is not hanging over magnet witch is securely attached to inner bottom of cube. Make sure the bar goes all the way up to the inner top of the cube barley touching it.<br>Step 5: Securely attach a magnet to the side of the lever that is hanging over the magnet that is attached to the inner botttom of cube.<br>Note: Magnets need to be facing each other with attracting poles N,S or S,N<br>Note: The lever is going to have to be realy close to the magnet on inner bottom of cube because of how close those magnetic fields need to be to interact. But not so close that magnets can touch.<br>The magnet on top connected to lever is pulling the magnet on inner bottom of cube towards it and since the magnet on inner bottom of cube is connected to cube, this pulling force acts as a lifting force. Now at the same time the magnet on inner bottom of cube is pulling the magnet on top downwards BUT the magnet on top is connected to the lever so any downwards pulling force is being converted mechanicaly by the lever into upwards lifting force. Now if you know anything about magnets you now that there are magnets powerfull enough to lift far more weight then just there own. So essentialy this divice is exploiting the powerfull pulling force of magnets by mechanicaly transforming its magnetic pulling force into mechanical lifting force through the clever utilization of a lever, and walla stuff can be made to fly. Imagine if the magnets in this experiment where electro magnets so the ammount of electrical current going into them determined the ammount of lifting force that it would have. Now imagine this system being used as an attachment that could be placed under or ontop of vehicles to counter the weight of the vehicle and any cargo its carying. Now imagine\u00a0 if this was done with powerfull permanent magnets and turned sideways and placed in an electric generator and had enough strength to pass through the magnetic fields as it propelled itself forwards with its own magnetic pulling force.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Signed\u00a0\u00a0 AMA", "comment_date": "2018-09-27T00:39:06Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Jim Hal", "comment_text": "Gyroscopic precession.", "comment_date": "2018-09-26T20:54:56Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Twist3d711", "comment_text": "This may have already been said because i have not fished through the entire section of 9,534 comments...

Think of it like a ring, made of same stuff(water) but a sort of separate due to particles moving in ring form, more like a solid object would have (splitting the particles at the tip, moving them-in this case pulling- along the surface and behind it) till it reaches low pressure point and gets sucked back in), so the ring goes out and stretches, untill it reaches the point in which it&#39;s internal resistance (swirling water) is too weak to still be the ring (the resistance of water is causing the ring to deform into blobs, cause it&#39;s easier for spinning water to sort withold it&#39;s movement along the deformation than keep pushing the water around), so the blob deformation builds up as the particles tend to make their movement easier, so to say. It breaks up in the weakest positions in which (due to pressure and movement -&gt; blob deformation) the moving water was squeezed out like half of baloon in the hand. The rotational movement and still water pressure are both pulling around and squeezing in underneath the previously broken ring part into basically a miniature atomic mushroom cloud donut... made of water.<br>This is my viewpoint on what happens :P I stay by it. Especially the mushroom cloud thing :D<br><br>Or a container in which there&#39;s a ball (building up spinning movement of particles of water) in the middle, and a rubber sheet dividing it into two parts - representing the resistance force of still water. As it&#39;s becomes pressurised (or vacuumed) on one side the sheet collapses around the ball, and since it&#39;s water and movement we&#39;re speaking of - the place where it &quot;closes around&quot; the ball would be a point of sucking the water in (low pressure + movement).

I believe the reason the primary ring splits into multiple smaller clusters, turn 90 degrees, and reform into smaller rings... is actually very simple.  It all has to do with the marrying of the vortex waves.  Due to the Path of Least Resistance, the two initial stage vortex clusters are propelled outwards with roughly the same inertia due to the symmetry of the experiment. Since both pumps (and I&#39;m assuming this) push the ink cluster forward they leave the component at quite likely a clockwise rotation.  If however you could force one cluster to leave at a counter clockwise rotation of the same velocity the result would mirror and quite likely not turn 90 degrees and expand in to smaller rings as witnessed.  However, since (again my belief) both vortex waves approach each other in line (but not in true balance) the result is the expansion forward as the primary ring expands and the residual waves comingle, gather, and then due to the inertia of the primary ring they have no option but expand one more time in to infinity as there is nothing more to effect the dynamic of the wave.", "comment_date": "2018-09-12T00:14:19Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Scott Bruner", "comment_text": "....&quot;Fill up the tank again, and give it another try&quot;....<br><br>I didnt expect this video to be so inspiring!

While making a vortex in the opposite direction adds a bit of chaos. It doesn&#39;t want to keep the shape but the motion of the water holds its form. The other day I tried something. Before creating the whirl pool I pulled the plug. The water was still as it drained. Now I know the water does spin down drains even in the smallest amount, there is motion. As the water drained I did two quick motions. Down and to the right. That was enough to create a vortex with the remaining water.

This video is a great exposition of what professional work in science is like.

Not coincidentally, the 3 years of work documented here add up to 1 project that I think would qualify for a PhD in, say, fluid physics or engineering, showing that the experimenter is qualified to work as a peer in the community of scholars ( ... if the work were fully documented in writing, with some of that writing giving an explanation of why and how this result fits into the context of what the rest of the fluid physics community is doing today and into the long arc of the field of fluid mechanics as a whole).

Think of it like one billard ball hitting another and the second takes off in the angle hit.

Consequently ink follows a path of least resistance - keeps going with momentum in an observable trajectory;albeit I think it is only moving in &quot;mostly&quot; perpendicular vectors. There are many chaotic internal scattering of trajectories in that first outward appearing vector but they kind of mesh-match and must average out in to a path that has a radius/distance inherent to the fluid medium that the ink is being tested. That distance relates with the fluid medium&#39;s density and energy of system. That first semi perpendicular outcrop travels up to a point...Not discussed on the video or perhaps experimented with is HOW different fluid mediums&#39; densities would influence that divergent path&#39;s radius (from impact etiology). I&#39;d hypothesize that different mediums create different appearances of the overall ink trajectory by influencing distance traversed and also vary all of the ring sizes. Even the point of initial rounding depends on different medium Densities analyzed.\u00a0However to the main conundrum (which IS cool)- what&#39;s with the second series of outcrop circles that are perpendicular and rounded? In short I think the answer lies in first understanding how density indexing plays a role and how energy of impact could be analyzed/understood.\u00a0I think testing different mediums would yield good reference data. Only then would you see a Mathematical pattern, (signature?) that could be used to index exact locations. That would yield pattern predicting data. It IS pretty uniform which means to me that there is an inherent pattern that could be compared to other Media; aptly high low pressure spots explain it better. But it&#39;s also more than just that because at some point it is the variance of molecular densities playing a role (ink used versus environment medium used).Now the cool secondary circle is part of the area of high-low pressures&#39; interactions. I have to think of the Bernoulli Equation as part of a reference for explanation as to how the outcrops follow different vectors suddenly (and the outer tubing in that reference is maybe the change of viscosity as the influenced by high-low pressure proportional to energy lost/transferred in the system. In that case the inherent resistance of that fluid medium (environment&#39;s viscosity) relates to momentum of the object (ink) and patterned shape deformation.... repetition and redundant, but I am brain dumping :-)\u00a0I guess the best answers lie with understanding unique impacts (signature indexes) of various fluid mediums empirically. Sure, maybe different inks as a secondary project could be swapped. But swapping both ink and medium would make for perhaps an apple to orange scenario for the variables with difficult cross related data interpretations; so best to experiment with environmental medium swap then characterize the ink material. Consider how distance of the outcrops could be understood if a series of mediums is annualized.\u00a0Might give a clue.But from your video, empirically, it is interesting how the spacing and circles are uniform. If you interpret just one stem, the part associated with the 2nd circle crop of the secondary &quot;bloom&quot;, you&#39;ll see a the threshold with that second distance propagated. I bet that&#39;s also an inherent environment medium-ink interface property which is proportional to the first radius of outcrop-stop point. But propagation stop is the point at which the energy of the vector gets overcompecaused by enough interference of the environment due to areas of high low pressure (aptly influences to a degree). But considering the inherent forces of attraction of the ink material (like begets like) to itself you end up with a scenario similar to internal external adhesion and repulsion that would propogate forever with many other tertiary quaternry etc blooms/circles if it weren&#39;t for inherent stopping point. For that point I imagine a fluid medium&#39;s stopping resistance relates to atomic friction-like forces of electrostatic and dipole moments; inherent to yet again density and molecular indexes. What the heck am I saying :-) basically another area of inherent molecular properties have a unique signature that dictates how many times those outcrops can go. And I envision a mix concepts- (1) mushroom cloud effect of explosion off the crust of Earth and a (2) similar Rupert&#39;s drop concept. When the matter of opposed system ink is traveling through overpowers the object moving in one vecter it then redirects. Enough times and it haults causing the destruction of it. But the appearance of circles is a fluid mechanic observation of how two mediums interact when kinetic energy is introduced (rippled/disturbed fluid are high low pressure areas). Eversee photoacoustic setups? I&#39;d think they&#39;re kind of similar.Any way cool setup. A+. Awesome visual data (FINALLY observed). And it&#39;s generated a lot of curious interest.

If The density of the water in the tank is less than that of the ink solution in the injectors then with the right burst of pressure the turning of fluid in the ring will happen at higher velocity. Iv done this with smoke rings. The fluid is constantly turning inside out like if you were to attach a tornado end to end, until the pressure equalizes and the vortex loses its velocity and form. When two vortexes colide the mass in between is ejected outwards and repeats the vortex process all over again using the remaining enertia and velocity from the original two. But this time the pressurized fluid is expanding outward in the form of a ring and not exiting a hole. If the colision is close enough to perfectly aligned and the velocity is stil strong enough, then the pressure of the fluid between will be forced out creating a negative pressure that tears the two rings apart while at the same time joining the two together as long as the velocities are the same. Thats why the secondaries are half one color and half the other, and also why they arent perfect circles. The velocities of turning fluid are changed or unmatched and so the secondaries are unstable. But mabe thats just from breaking apart? Mabe if they could maintain the velosity and not slow down and dissipate they would eventualy equalize, stabilize,  and blend? What if you put the injectors within half the distance of eachother so that the colision is stronger?", "comment_date": "2018-08-16T08:24:45Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "jks", "comment_text": "\u8c22\u8c22\u4f60\u505a\u7684\u89c6\u9891", "comment_date": "2018-08-16T03:32:41Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Sander de Vries", "comment_text": "This is so incredibly inspiring!!

When a vortex line is severed, it doesn&#39;t like ending in a fluid and will twist from torque and angular momentum like forces.  It&#39;s only hope of becoming stable again is to find another vortex line to join up with.  When the collision is symmetrical(spatially and net force) the opposite rotation of each torus allows the severed vortex line from each torus to line up with each other and become one.  The 90 degree turn with a laminar secondary is the result of the vortex lines rejoining quickly.  Turbulent secondaries seem to be caused when the vortex lines dance around each other, but can&#39;t join up.   You can predict early on where the &quot;secondaries&quot; will form by looking for where the outer &quot;torque&quot; layer begins to flow over the opposing torus.  Its cool to see a broken vortex line from a red torus can join with a broken vortex line from a blue torus to make a new vortex line to create a &quot;secondary&quot; with colors from both torus.

This causes the further branching which causes the same effect to happen as before but since this time the particles are now moving at 90 degrees the rings also will be at 90 degrees. The branches remember are shooting in straight lines again and get dragged through friction and create more rings. That&#39;s at least what it looks like to me.

The expansion leads to pressure changes (everything moving is describable in a wavelike function through time), thus you have peak densities at which rotational forces occur due to them being the most energy efficient way to let energy dissipate in a closed environment. So you get the membrane formation when the waves interfere with each other, expansion until forward directional movement has largely been converted. But at that point we&#39;ve only accounted for directional movement not rotational movement (vortexes are rotating outward) so we can consider the expansion to actually accentuate the rotation, as well as the rotation of both vortexes complementing each other. But at some point the remaining energy isn&#39;t enough to overcome friction by itself after the initial expansion stages, so what happens is a separation into low pressure and high pressure on the basis of the remaining velocity of the initial wave. That&#39;s what causes the initial outer ring to split along with some mechanics of waves traveling through fluids that holds some areas of the fluid together better than others, on the edges we actually have 2 opposite sides correctly rotating, simply the separation of low and high pressure areas is enough to get the low pressure areas into rotational movement through friction.

When they collide, their equal energies are forced outward, perpendicular to the direction of the two masses, where there is less energy/pressure. Latent mass follows the initial collision, expanding the disc. At the perimeter of the disc, there is resistance that sweeps around it and is drawn to the lower-pressure areas toward the centre of the disc at either side of it, causing rotation. I would imagine at the perimeter of the secondary rings are smaller tertiary rings, and so-forth, provided you can produce a large and accurate -enough collision.<br>As for the equidistance of the ssecondary rings, a larger sample size of varying volumes of ink might identify a variable or constant that is fundamental to the equation, maybe count the number of secondary rings and compare it to the circumference of the primary ring.

Get the initial impact just right (4 years it took!) - the expanding, still micro-counter-roatating ring (fluid discs??) must break into uniform satellite vortices. This is where it gets fuzzy for me but consider the following 2 strange phenomena I&#39;ve observed with my own rings:<br>If you blow a ring &amp; then gently touch it with your finger you will break it&#39;s perfect uniform tension, instantly separating at that point into two receding &quot;tails&quot; twisting to a point like rolling bread dough as they race in opposite directions to the opposite side of the ring where a catastrophic failure occurs in a mass of bubbles. I suggest something similar takes place on each side of your secondary rings in the tank. Perhaps, the obvious component is drag vs diminishing momentum.<br>The second phenomenon I&#39;ll throw in for fun &amp; more head scratching. The trick is elusive &amp; difficult to reproduce in open water.  But the bottom of a calm swimming pool is best.:<br><br>If you blow two perfect rings in quick succession the second one will overtake the first. Then something magical happens.  The overtaking ring uniformly compresses in diameter in the toroidal wake of the first ring, then rapidly accelerates passing clean through the first.  If the pool is deep enough the first ring then becomes the pursuer and will repeat the process. Enjoy the thought!

So after the collision.. From both the side a circular motion at the edges start which results in a spinning tycoon.. And so it attracts other fluid also.. After  every other circular secondary rings attracted the remaining fluid the pressure breaks.. And results in the breakage of primary rings..

While there are many that I could think of on a daily life standpoint that I can improve upon. However, for anyone interested in reading this, the one thing to me that I see as my &quot;Vortex Ring Collision&quot; is my book(s). I am an aspiring writer, and back in high school, say 10 years ago, I stumbled upon a very cool idea for a story. It started as a simple frame by frame drawing of a fight that intrigued all of my fellow students during a Study Period, and morphed into a full fledged comic book. Everything was there, the plot, the conflict, the characters, everything. There was one problem, I&#39;m terrible at drawing, and I felt that my mediocre stick figures wasn&#39;t doing my story justice and I lost my motivation to continue. I made several attempts to go around this problem, like trying to find someone who could do the drawing, or improving my own art, but to no avail. Then, I remember in college reading my first Tom Clancy novel, &quot;The Hunt for Red October&quot;, and thinking &quot;Wow, you can actually picture in your head how he wants the readers to imagine the action that is going on&quot;. It was the first time I really experienced something like this and it demanded my attention. I was still scared of going back to this original story idea because it had developed at\u00a0this point from a hobby to almost an obsession, piecing together parts of this book and its characters to the finest details I could come up with, and writing them all down in a notebook, knowing perfectly well that I may never actually use them. So, I wanted to test my newfound platform of storytelling, and made a couple of fan fictions. I went with games I enjoyed playing, like Mass Effect, which I made a 50 page short story on, and Borderlands, which went from a short story idea to a 300 page fan fiction. From my friends and family, the stories were a success. However, the original story idea was still a much bigger project and I was again still scared of not being able to do my story justice. Then, about a year and a half ago, I met a new friend, who thought a lot like me, and I shared my book idea with him. I told him what it looked like when it started, and how much it changed over the years. To my surprise, the story was not done changing. I had discovered, with my new friend, an entirely different angle to tell the story, in such a way that I never before imagined, and thought &quot;This could work. I can actually do this.&quot; Now, a year and a half later, and while yes\u00a0I have had a couple of hiatuses in writing this book, whether it be from writers block, or from other things happening in my life,\u00a0I am\u00a0roughly 250\u00a0pages into my first book, and I have a total of at least 10 books planned out for this series. The story is ever expanding, with my friend and I constantly bouncing ideas off of each other and improving upon it. At this point,\u00a0the story has transformed from a hobby, to my life&#39;s work, and it is a constant struggle to make sure it is the best I can make it to be, but I can&#39;t wait to see it all come to fruition and if I ever can, to show my story to the world, or to at least anyone willing to read it. Thank you for anyone willing to read my little tangent here, I know, this may have not been the video to post such a thing in, but his lesson on persistence really resonated with me and I thought that I would share.", "comment_date": "2018-07-11T03:49:41Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Matt Templar", "comment_text": "The quality of the ring/rings in the Australia video are still far beyond your results :(", "comment_date": "2018-07-11T03:23:12Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Joshua Lewis", "comment_text": "It&#39;s almost like an explosion in an explosion", "comment_date": "2018-07-11T03:08:25Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "frank javier", "comment_text": "Una observaci\u00f3n o idea que pasar\u00eda si hacen este experimento bajo vrivaciones de diferentes frecuencias", "comment_date": "2018-07-11T02:59:44Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Yotin Clips", "comment_text": "This is a real oddly satisfying video<br>Not all that clickbait in YT", "comment_date": "2018-07-11T02:57:42Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "999 forEver", "comment_text": "What Aokiji vs Akainu probably looked like", "comment_date": "2018-07-11T02:54:48Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Catch A Case", "comment_text": "Your joken right?

In order for the vortex to be propelled forward in a fluid, it must spin &quot;inside out&quot;. Both sides are doing the same. At the point of impact (assuming they hit just right as you painstakingly know) each side attempts to roll away from the collision.... so far so good, but when the ring gets too large for the ink to hold together, it tears into smaller sections, and because of the higher density of the ink vs. water, they connect all the while continuing to move away from each other, creating the new, smaller toroidal vortices we see around the former site of contact....

The fluid is forced to expand in a smaller area which would probably be easier due to the lesser amount of resistance on the fluid due to less surface area. So the reason it turns 90 degrees is because the pressure wave projected from the center point wants to keep moving outwards but cant because of the water resisting it. but it would make more sense if the second shape projected was an oval or bounced back towards the source in a larger ring.

I can totally understand what you or your team are stuck into this for three years. <br><br>My personal explanation is, when first two rings collides, the coming water will keep pushing them. Thus they end up to be the flat plate. But they can&#39;t keep being larger forever, they will meet a critical point that the plate can&#39;t maintain its shape and break apart ( same phenomenon happens when you squish a clay ball really hard, perimeter will break at several parts after a well.) Just like the clay ball, the break point (attaining critical attraction) will start at several points, then between each break points, there forms several segments between two break point. After breaking, each segments start to contract (like rubber ring), and ends up with each segments (curved, not straight, since perimeter of the original plate is curved) contracting to its center. Finally forms the secondary ring.<br><br>If above process make sense, some further experiment can be thought of. Number of break points happen on the plate may depends on the size and speed of the coloured rings, which may depend on distance, pumping speed, ...or other possible factors. And the angle of the curved segments approximately antiproportional to number of break points. So by adjusting the angle of the segments.<br>1. If the angle of the segments is really large, the secondary ring may not appear, or appear in a strange manner.<br>2.

Directional motion (force) moving radially from the center of the initial collision (along the Z axis) and the result of that radial motion (force) on the fluid in ITS path to either side of that radial motion/force (along the Y axis). <br><br>Unless ALL of the fluid in the tank is totally motionless (and I mean TOTALLY), then as the result of the initial radial collision force, ONE side of that Z axis is going to have a differential lateral (perpendicular) force/pressure compared to the opposing side, irrespective of how little (or &#39;immeasurable&#39; that force (pressure) may be). <br><br>The combination of the lateral force with the differential &#39;splitting&#39; lateral (perpendicular) force creates a compound or secondary collision where the primary (initial) radial force is greater that the secondary (lateral/perpendicular) force (because it came first and therefore has more inertia) and this &#39;force ratio/relationship&#39; necessarily causes the &#39;nodes&#39; (caused by the initial collision &amp; radial spread) to turn 90 degrees because of the greater force of the initial radial momentum to the lesser &#39;split&#39; (lateral/perpendicular) force/momentum. <br><br>You&#39;ve got a kind of initial &#39;vortex spin&#39; that, while still spinning, gets tossed sideways as the greater force of the initial collision &#39;splits&#39; the fluid to the side as the large ring expands, so the &#39;spinning&#39; node turns sideways along the same axis as the direction of the expanding initial collision. Since nature ALWAYS moves in vortexes (and never in a straight line), as long as there is sufficient motion/force and momentum, new stages of vortexes &#39;rings&#39; will continue to appear, 90 degrees to the axis from which they are generated. If this attempt at a description of my theory can be followed, I&#39;d like to hear your thoughts on it.<br><br>Additionally, it doesn&#39;t appear that the INITIAL collision is between two vortices, but between two linear expulsions of ink in water; i.e. no vortex is generated by the plunger or the orifices from which the ink emerges. It appears that vortices only emerge from the resulting collision radially from 90 degrees off the Z axis).<br><br>The sequence of directional force is #1: X axis (blue and red ink moving towards each other), and then Y &amp; Z axes simultaneously (creating the 360 degree ring expanding out 90 degrees from the initial X axis collision. <br><br>The secondary &#39;rings&#39; (actually vortices) form at 90 degrees to the initial collision along the X axis because the force of the initial collision is greater than the force of the secondary collision of the initial ring with the surrounding (relatively &#39;static&#39;) fluid.", "comment_date": "2018-06-27T23:20:51Z", "likes_count": 6}, {"comment_by": "Joe McCann", "comment_text": "NiCe VaPe BrO", "comment_date": "2018-06-27T23:17:09Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Manchux", "comment_text": "1.4 K of Dislikes????????", "comment_date": "2018-06-27T22:59:42Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "No.1", "comment_text": "This is one of the coolest videos I&#39;ve ever seen, specifically because you eventually recognized that persistence and surrounding yourself with like-minded individuals was the &#39;far bigger thing&#39; that ended up resulting from a pursuing simple initial desire to satisfy your curiosity.

Change the vector, you change the orientation of the ring. Since the vector is now from the center to the edge, the ring is thus facing the exterior. Do vortex&#39;s move laterally?

(This was years ago- I&#39;m not sure if anyone is doing it now.) <br><br>The spinning tip vortex generated under high G entrains the smoke and you get very high angular velocity tubes of rotating smoke...but the real interesting phenomena occur nearly a MILE behind the airplane: the two counter-rotating tubes of smoke merge...turn 90 degrees...and then break into two lateral tubes that separate,  giving a chain of smoke rings where before there were only two parallel tubes of spinning smoke. <br><br>That&#39;s what you have when the two vortices collide- if you look at the outer edge,  it consists of two parallel spinning tubes- contra-rotating-  that again- can only merge to produce an additional spinning region 90 degrees to the original tubes.

I believe the seeds of the secondary vortices reside in the original toroidal projectiles. Take notice of several details. As soon as the toruses collide there begin to form spokes as the two mushroom clouds expand against each other. This suggests imbalances in the original toruses, which, because they collide slightly off balance, cause the roots of spinning. As the spokes expand you begin to see vortex shedding even before the secondary vortices organize (This is most notable in the yellow and blue end-on view). Also, notice that at the moment the secondary vortices begin to form the two colors are initially separate and on the same side as the torus from which they originated. I think that this fact suggests that the outward expansion is more powerful and quicker than the spin caused by the spokes (original imbalances). As to the number and distance from center of the secondary vortices, I think these give evidence of the density and viscosity of fluid medium. The spokes reach a critical point where their internal spin predominates over the outward push of the ink (similar to a bowling ball slowing forward motion so that the spin allows it to grip the floor and curve as it approaches the pins). This is the point when the secondary vortices form. <br>I would predict if the fluid were less dense and/or less viscous, the vortices would form closer (and sooner) to the center of collision, and they would be fewer in number. Conversely, a more viscous and/or more dense fluid would result in more vortices and a greater distance from the center. <br>The one question I could not answer from the video because of the quickness of the process (slower motion could solve this problem) was the direction of spin of the secondary vortices. Was it one direction only, or both, or random? Are there clues in the spokes for which way they will spin? Are all of the vortices in a given trial spinning the same direction, alternating direction, or random?<br>In conclusion, I have provided a hypothesis for the source of the secondary vortices, a way to test the hypothesis, and further questions about the nature of the vortices.

Many years ago I first tried a program called logisim, which if you know don&#39;t know is a logic circuit simulator, lots of fun, very educational, I highly suggest trying it. But anyways, ever since trying that I&#39;ve had this idea in my head that I want to make my own breadboard computer out of logic chips and discrete components etc. I knew nothing about computer science or electrical engineering at the time and the idea always sorta stayed on the backburner because of that. But 6 months ago or so I started learning electronics and though I&#39;m still a very long way from building a computer, reaching that goal is actually something that seems doable now. I have a lot of fun experimenting with electronics and learning new things and watching/reading things on the topic to learn more. It&#39;s been a really fulfilling journey. I guess the moral of the story is don&#39;t be afraid to go out there and do something you&#39;ve always wanted to do. You have nothing to lose. In my case the &quot;lab&quot; I built cost no more than maybe a couple hundred dollars, since most chips and components are dirt cheap. The hardest part for me was probably just getting started and learning what exactly I needed and where the best place was to get it. After that it was just a matter of buying what I could and learning how to use it. Best of luck to you all.

The number of secondary rings is equal to the number of turns in the original loop. Put it another way - the vortex has spin as well as forward motion.

Two identical orbs of fluid move towards each other at the same speed and rotate opposite of eachother, like gears. When they collide, the orbs flatten out onto each other and as the pancake gets flatter and wider, the edge is slightly thicker than the &quot;connection&quot; between there and the center. So the connection will at some point break and the ring along the outside still had the same friction of moving against each other. As it widens there isn&#39;t enough fluid to keep it a ring either because the fluid membrane popped or the ring doesn&#39;t supply it, and it separates almost perfectly because the orbs impacting was almost perfect. That results in multiple rotating masses along a perpendicular axis and the velocity of it results in the rings until those too pop from lack of tension.<br><br>The middle of the pancake however is more complex. One guess is that the fluid masses impacted and had more &quot;back and forth&quot; fluid movement and friction than &quot;side to side&quot;, therefore keeping more fluid  in the middle as the outer ring simply impacted and most every bit of its momentum shot perpendicular. And of course that ring pulls needed fluid from the central vibrating orb until it becomes too weak to support itself.<br><br>I&#39;ll watch the rest of the video to see your explanation now and see how my prediction compared", "comment_date": "2018-06-24T14:06:18Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "James Sterry-blunt", "comment_text": "could this 90 degree rotation of come from paramagnetic properties of water? can you do this with another liquid?", "comment_date": "2018-06-24T14:06:03Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Vota", "comment_text": "<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVbdbVhzcM4&amp;t=4m53s\">4:53</a> \u041a\u0430\u0437\u0430\u043b\u043e\u0441\u044c \u0431\u044b...", "comment_date": "2018-06-24T14:03:16Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Renson Nicor", "comment_text": "New Vape trick to learn.", "comment_date": "2018-06-24T14:02:33Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Pauluz The Web Gnome", "comment_text": "Could expect that!", "comment_date": "2018-06-24T14:00:22Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Erik Feketefoldi", "comment_text": "Respect man!

I&#39;d think that the volume of each torus stays the same during expansion. Then stability decreases until both rings tear apart. Due to suction new smaller rings are formed because the neighbouring open ends of the different rings connect. The point this happens might be the point where the dimensions of the new rings are most stable. I could imagine it might look like something where graphs of the volume of a torus V=2*pi^2*r^2*R and the stable ratio of n tori S=n*x*r/R cross each other (x being the the factor at the most stable point).

It has to do with the low pressure zones being pushed into not only from the sides from the high pressure zones, but from the already high pressure of the originating collision to expand outward from the center. This could cause a funnel effect through the center of the low pressure zones because you have high pressure coming from five different directions on three axis\u2019s. This allows for an escape of all high pressure through the center and causing the small vortexes to appear from all material being pushed in and tumbled into the toroid like shapes. Again, I can be wrong but I saw this in my head and thought this may be reasonable.

But since it cannot move to the other side fully, it creates an angle in order to try to do so. Think of it as two people trying to move against each other across a small path with walls on on each side. It&#39;s wide enough for 1 person moving straight ahead but since there&#39;s two people, they need to walk sideways when they meet each other. It&#39;s a lot easier than one person to bend down and the other to jump over.

Bean", "comment_text": "I&#39;m pretty much a nobody in this sphere of fluid dynamics (although I do have a BSME) but here&#39;s my input; as Don Pettit (sp?) states, there&#39;s a low pressure area that causes the pulling and separation - but why.  Well, I think you have to start at the beginning: there&#39;s velocity at play as the dye liquid was originally propelled from the cylinder.  We need to consider the way it was propelled - it was pushed through a cylinder.  So fluid dynamics tells us there will be a laminar boundary layer of fluid that is theoretically with a zero velocity at the wall of the tube, and then the laminar flow of the center of the column that has the assumed least amount of friction in the column.  As it moves forward, there is a viscous property that pulls the fluid behind it, from center to boundary, causing a velocity variance along the fluid plane.  Now, the two dye solutions collide, but not all the dye fluid collides all at once, the front wall of the fluid collides, then each slice of the fluid collides after it.  The fluid is dispersed in an &#39;an equal and opposite reaction&#39; as that first wall collides, but then the next slice hits and the friction of the dye fluid pulls back and in some of the dispersing dye fluid before it.  This then creates a non-turbulent (i.e. laminar) rolling fluid that is progressing 90 degrees from the original vector.  As it thins AND rolls, there is an elastic separation that causes the dye fluid to react in an equal and opposite direction again (think a rubber band that was stretched outward and then suddenly released).  However, there is fluid in the space that it would occupy, so instead of filling that entire space, it creates another ring, still spinning.  I think that if you were to try to recreate this with smoke you would not get the same response because the frictional coefficients of smoke in air would not behave with the same frictional properties.   That&#39;s my best theory.", "comment_date": "2018-06-22T21:54:09Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Arben Daci", "comment_text": "Great Great Video, I Just Love It.

It is difficult to visualize, as the water is clear, and not moving the way the original vortexes move towards each other.  I guess imagine walking thru chest high water in a pool.  The water is not &quot;moving&quot;, yet you can feel it pushing against you.  The same for the ring pushing against the water.  At a point, the forces of the water pushing and the ring moving become more equalize, and the ring &quot;breaks&quot; up.   However, the energy does not just disappear.

Let&#39;s say you have two wheels in the same plane, like a car&#39;s left side. The back one turns backwards (equivalent to reverse gear), the front one turns forwards (equivalent to first gear).

There is already pressure coming from the direction of the actuators and the ring is moving outwards so the path of least resistance would be to move outward at a 90 degree to the ring. These rings are created when there is a relatively narrow, faster flow through the center of the ring and it drags the material (smoke, dye, air, ect.) along with it but that moves away from the inner air flow and slows down where it then is dragged back in continuing the ring, and as the narrower faster flow disperses and widens so does the ring. So if the low pressure zones are causing the material to move to one spot where the high pressure zones are moving outward then the high pressure zones would move the material with it, dragging it along, and creating a ring at a 90 degree angle.<br><br>Anyways that&#39;s my hypothesis, I really would love it if people replied to tell me where I went wrong or right with this thought.", "comment_date": "2018-06-22T05:54:42Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Hybrid10Prime Creative", "comment_text": "You are awesome.

You and others may be interested in a study by NASA and the FAA in the 1980s to study vortex turbulence caused by aircraft, and the effects on other aircraft.<br>To me, the effects of wingtip vortices on other aircraft was a no-brainer. These effects were the focus of this study on aircraft safety, while little attention was paid to the generation and propagation of the smoke streams used to make the vortices visible.<br>At the time, I was involved in Unlimited Air Racing, and could usually be found at an airport, looking up. One of the usual suspects in air racing had contracted to fly his Hawker Sea Fury for the study to generate the vortices to be studied. They did this with wingtip mounted smoke generators developed by the government in secret. These were no ordinary smoke bombs nor fireworks, but used a secret formula to create the longest lasting aerial smoke trails ever seen. It reminded me of solid fuel rocket smoke. The Feds insisted on mounting and un-mounting the pods themselves behind closed doors.<br>As you would imagine, as the smoke streams left the wingtips the spinning vortices became immediately visible. The objective was to fly another aircraft through the vortex turbulence and to note effects on that aircraft.<br>Well, as happens with boys and their toys, the pilot of the smoke plane decided to fly his Hawker through some basic aerobatic maneuvers. Those of us watching have seen some of the best pilots ever to fly do these maneuvers flawlessly, but this time was different. Because of the extra dense and long hang time smoke of these generators, the spinning vortices did something incredible.  As the vortices moved closer to each other, they began to unwind. Then astonishingly, the two smoke streams joined into single giant smoke rings, their diameter being equal to the wingspan of the plane.<br>The formation of both the vortices and development of the final rings is very much like the effects noted in your experiments.<br>Keep up the great video work, and stay curious!<br>peace-out Tc", "comment_date": "2018-06-22T04:20:09Z", "likes_count": 61}, {"comment_by": "Nigel Fernandes", "comment_text": "The bend of 90 degree is due to collision of the fluid in the same axis and ring moving outwards must be due to inertial force in the fluid both the ink and water have different viscosity...", "comment_date": "2018-06-22T04:19:58Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Grapes", "comment_text": "Incredible", "comment_date": "2018-06-22T04:19:42Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "GowayImAFK", "comment_text": "This video should have way more views than it does!

But the surface tension, differences in surface energy between the to fluids, causes the ink to want to hold together for a while before osmosis takes over and disperses the ink (surface chemistry).  As the primary ring expands and thins, the ink wants to collect in on itself in a more surface energy efficient form, or a sphere.  So the outer ring breaks up and draws into smaller spheres, but the momentum towards forming a sphere causes a secondary collision, forming the secondary rings.", "comment_date": "2018-06-22T03:46:18Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "ScienceGuy", "comment_text": "Jifs? <b>unsubscribe</b>", "comment_date": "2018-06-22T03:46:00Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Brett Ritchie", "comment_text": "The secondary rings didn&#39;t turn 90 degrees, the initial collision turned the water 90 degrees.

I had to slow The video playback down to really notice the sinusoidal wave forming at the edges of the ring. I feel like as it expands from the center it becomes thinner and it starts to destabilize. Thus, it may lead to the collapse into the rings. If their forward force vector decreased then maybe that energy was converted into angular momentum. It caused the edge to started oscillating until the low density pocket formed with enough energy to break the waveform. This may have created torque on the rings and caused them to continue until they lost angular momentum. The reason as to why it the rings turned 90 degrees could have been due to the maximum speed of the die through the water. I wonder if you launched them slower, if they would turn the whole 90 degrees or would they turn less then 90 degrees.

But, what might be happening is, due to the velocity V of the original large ring forming, the air that was affected by that low pressure is still moving at that same velocity V, at a direction perpendicular to the center.  So, because of the direction of the initial velocity, away from the center, and the secondary pressure, the low pressure pulling the air back in, the result is a ring, comprised of an airflow which is rotating counterclockwise, as if you were looking at a cross section of one of the the secondary rings. I\u2019m thinking that because of newton\u2019s third law, the pressure from the collision all has to disperse evenly, at a direction opposite the initial force.  Being that the collision is happening under water, an all in one point, the most even shape it can disperse in, is a circle.  Since that ring keeps moving, the resulting affected low pressure air gets forced into a swirling motion, rotating inward, also still traveling away from the center of the initial ring, forming a smaller, horizontal ring.

I Beleive it works very similarly to those &quot;underwater oceans&quot; I Beleive you may have even dine a video on one yourself but, in effect there is a surface tension between the two fluids in this case the dye and the water, when the two main vortexs collide, we seem them flatten out much like a raindrop hitting a flat surface but in this case with the lack of gravity and the decreased effect of inertia due to the lack of forward acceleration of each vortex, it merely splays out flat, then surface tension and cohesion comes I to play, the center of the now disc wants to pull to the outside and vice versa but the outside is accelerating outward and thus the center part fly outward, now, with the cohesion of the dye, and the surface tension of the dye and the water, the dye remains separated mostly. As the outer portion of the dye begins to slow down the inner portion accelerating towards the ring that is forming then carries it&#39;s momentum through the now perfect ring of dye causing the ring to once again expand outwards, much like grabbing a rubber band and pulling it, eventually cohesion will break. But with the friction between the water and the dye, the dye on the outermost portion begins to slow down but the inner portion still carrying momentum and then we get the rotation we see from the vortexs and as the cohesion of the whole ring begins to fail, we see it fragment and cohesion once again forms pockets accelerating away from the center and rotating like a vortex due to the fluid friction.", "comment_date": "2018-06-22T00:49:20Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Guthyerrz Maciel", "comment_text": "The video is really cool but do you have a reason for never washing you hat?", "comment_date": "2018-06-22T00:47:40Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "SSPsGoku", "comment_text": "Hi this is Destin and you&#39;re getting (more) MadscientistEveryDay", "comment_date": "2018-06-22T00:43:15Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Cmule", "comment_text": "This was amazing!

This happens because the heat and speed of the explosion is moving faster than the air above can move out of the way. <br>The tertiary rings that form are probably a result of inertia. When the pressure waves collide and pancake, their kinetic energy is redirected outward. This outward motion manages to hold together for a while but eventually stretches to the point of destabilizing. That is when those low pressure zones managed to break up the secondary ring. However, that pressure wave still has energy going out at 90 degrees from the initial impact and the drag from the still, surrounding water peels back the leading edge, causing it to form those tertiary rings in the same manner as you created the first one. They are smaller and less uniform because much of the energy has been dissipated, as has much of the dye. <br>The key, then, is to make sure the initial impact was created between two rings of equal inertia hitting dead on. Any imbalance (more dye on one side, the angle of trajectory being off by the slightest degree, one side going off first or with greater velocity) and the whole pattern of events collapses.", "comment_date": "2018-06-21T14:51:40Z", "likes_count": 3}, {"comment_by": "Horus Coming", "comment_text": "Maybe you should do a video on evolution vs creation?

Sometimes two would hit just right (one hitting the other from behind, a little offset) and a baby ring would get shot away in some direction. Sometimes they would join into a big one. They were fast, small, and powerful, so anything that happened ocurred in a fraction of a second.<br>I started getting into making mouth-made rings, where a released air bubble transforms itself into a huge ring. Then, I accidentally made two collide. As one approaches the other from behind, offset by the whole diameter, their edges actually suck together and make a massive, wobbly ring. There are waves going through it, and when it reaches one end, it can make it a concave shape. As like earlier, it sucks together, but now on itself. A new ring pops off in whatever direction the wave happens to be oriented. Often the rings break down in this process, but sometimes two perfectly stable (but wavy) rings (one massive [2-3 feet] and one small [~half a foot]). The big ones are very slow. You can stick your hand into one and feel it spinning for a several seconds. The small ones are feel-able, but they last for a fraction of the time of the big ones. <br><br>I have a 60 fps waterproof camera if you\u2019d like to see it.", "comment_date": "2018-06-21T12:49:01Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "mario kajin", "comment_text": "Super Giga ultra like.", "comment_date": "2018-06-21T12:48:08Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Andrei Markin", "comment_text": "You should try this with fluorescent dyes under a UV lamp, would look even more amazing", "comment_date": "2018-06-21T12:47:49Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Rick Wheeler", "comment_text": "Hello Justin.

The wavefronts lower pressure side helps keep the material moving outward. The action that creates the second rings is that the clumps inside high-pressure area are naturally going to the low-pressure wavefront. As these clumps are somewhat spherical at this point the resultant action is that the clumps inside moves outward from the collision area. This, in turn, makes this spherical structure turn inside out. This action of the clumps insides going outward and the edges of the clumps moving slower means once the material has distorted enough the outside will be sucked into the inside from behind these rings (closest area to collision area ). This makes it own little vortices which appear 90\u00b0 rotated.<br><br>As an extra note material is still fed during and after this to behind the secondary vortices and this material is fed through the center of the vortices as well adding to the vortices rotational speed and velocity.

Water can&#39;t be compressed, so the volume of water flowing into any &quot;Region&quot; has to equal the volume of water flowing out. <br><br>Let me define the &quot;Axis&quot; as the line or direction between the two vortices. This is also the axis of rotational symmetry of the problem. <br><br>At the collision, you have a lot of water flowing in along the Axis. Looking at the collision as a Region (all the colored part is a region, for example), there is a lot of water flowing in through the axis directions. Hence, because fluid motion is incompressible, the water must also flow outwards perpendicularly to the axis. You could call it radial. <br><br>The volume of water flowing in or out of a region is the water velocity times the area of the region = A*v. Faster velocity or faster area, more volume. <br><br>Each vortex ring is quite wide, but the edge of the disk that forms is quite narrow. The water flows in through the flat part of the disk and flows out through the edges. Since volume of water flowing = A*v is conserved, when A becomes small (for the edge), v becomes large. So the water flowing outward Radially (perpendicular to Axis) is moving quite fast compared to the rings motion along the Axis. <br><br>Whenever a fluid moves sufficiently quickly relative to its surroundings, viscous friction slows down part of the fluid, it peels back and forms a vortex. The mechanism that caused the original vortices to form was an injection of fast-moving water. But now the edge of the collision is injecting fast-moving water radially in all directions. This is the simple reason why the vortices have &quot;changed direction&quot; or become &quot;perpendicular&quot; to their original state. <br><br>The motion of the water became perpendicular, because it flowed in along 1 direction, and hence must flow out along the perpendicular directions. <br>So the vortices became perpendicular. <br><br>Very beautiful video. <br><br>Btw the total angular momentum of a vortex is 0. You know this because each rotating ring has an opposite ring on the other side which cancels it out, but also because vortices are formed by injecting a stream of fluid without rotation.<br><br>Also btw the # of child vortices is the result of an &quot;instability,&quot; which is powered by the perpendicular velocity of the water. So I would naively guess that a stronger vortex collision (in some sense) would affect the spacing and # of the child vortices.", "comment_date": "2018-06-21T01:13:27Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Aaron Tracy", "comment_text": "This is a fantastic channel and I enjoy your videos immensely, but it is &quot;Pull It Sir&quot; not &quot;Pew Lit Zir&quot;.", "comment_date": "2018-06-21T01:13:17Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "tartarus216", "comment_text": "Nice job, thanks for sharing this.

The closer in speed the two primary vortices are rotating, the fewer secondaries are produced.

It seems to me that the secondary vortices are perpendicular to the original vortices, because the impact of the 1st vortices. Since the kinetic energies and masses of the two original vortices are about equal, it causes the residual impact energy to propagate vectors which are perpendicular to the change in vector from the original vortices. As the low pressure zones form, the perpendicular kinetic energy vectors carry on visually with the ink and form the new vortices. They form in just the same way that you create the original vortices. Just my eye test \ud83d\ude05<br><br>Now that you&#39;ve started this idea, I say you do it again but with fluids that are non-polar. This might inhibit the ink/water from &quot;sticking&quot; to itself which is my theory on why the low pressure zones form. Due the the ink/water being carried away from the impact in a perpendicular vector, the amount of ink to evenly spread across that ever increasing surface area of the ink circle, decreases. Perhaps the polarity of the water and seemingly water-soluble ink, creates a threshold of diffusion. At that point, the ink/water re-coalesce, with vectors in tangent lines from the farthest point of least mass of ink/water (low pressure zones). So now there&#39;s the perfect two perpendicular vectors of inertia to create secondary vortices, along a circular path perpendicular to the original vortices.", "comment_date": "2018-06-20T22:47:57Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Zachary Bearden", "comment_text": "Loved it!

Nature has a tendency to move all systems to the lowest energy states so there must come a point at which the energy required to maintain the expansion of the ring is greater than that of multiple smaller vortexes and the system collapses. This is analogous to the surface tension of water pulling a laminar flow into droplets.<br><br>The reason that the secondary vortexes are perpendicular to the primary vortexes is down to the conservation of momentum. This is akin to the reasons that a galaxies assume a disk like formation. For a mixture of particles with a random distribution of velocities and position, there is still an inherent axis of rotation. In the case of the secondary rings, the collapse of the primary vortex results in two relatively equal masses that are headed toward each other but are still subject to the outward momentum of the initial vortex. Their collision, being at approximately the same speed and mass results in net cancellation of motion around the initial vortex&#39;s perimeter and forces the rings outward.<br><br>The perpendicular orientation is down to gyroscopic processes. The initial vortex was expanding outward. The collapse acted as a force on a spinning object, resulting in a current turned 90 degrees, as is expected when a gyroscope is acted upon.<br><br>I&#39;d love to know your thoughts and thank you for so much hard work.", "comment_date": "2018-06-20T22:23:14Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Nejx", "comment_text": "Can&#39;t wait to see Captain Sparklez react to this on reddit", "comment_date": "2018-06-20T22:23:02Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "rockymentis", "comment_text": "wash your hat!", "comment_date": "2018-06-20T22:22:41Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Teya Logos", "comment_text": "Thank you so much for sharing this!

When these waves grow to the point of linking they have already misaligned significantly from the original direction of the vorticity.

On the matter of what, at least, I have to overcome, unfortunately it&#39;s time. There&#39;s only a pretty set amount of time available each day for mental work before your brain turns into mush. On the other hand, you seem to be able to present a project that has been running for weeks, months and years every few weeks. What&#39;s noticeable about the way you do it is through collaborations and assignments, or to put it simply, project management. These are mini research projects and you&#39;ve got lots of them running at the same time. Obviously, you can&#39;t be present in all of them at the same time, plus you have to have some time for yourself and your family, but you&#39;ve quite literally set up a popular science (or should I say engineering?) research facility. So what you do is mainly setting up the projects, managing them to some extend, a bit of hands-on work and doing the brilliant dissemination for them. You work on a plan, you can secure the resources, you&#39;ve got a lot of people to help you and you can deliver these awesome videos. But you can&#39;t do everything.<br><br>So, where I&#39;m getting at is this: My (very) late grandpa used to say that man can do anything, except to squeeze juice out of a stone. I think that apart from the stone-juice (which I bet there are a million ways to prove him wrong), man can&#39;t do a lot of things, or at least, to certain degree, not all people can do all things other people can. Every personal endeavour has multiple hard constraints that can&#39;t be overcome with sheer willpower and work. But there is a silver lining. C.P. Cavafy wrote a poem called Ithaka in 1911. It was about Odysseus&#39; voyage back home. <br><br>As you set out for Ithaka<br>hope the voyage is a long one,<br>full of adventure, full of discovery.<br>Laistrygonians and Cyclops,<br>angry Poseidon\u2014don\u2019t be afraid of them:<br>you\u2019ll never find things like that on your way<br>as long as you keep your thoughts raised high,<br>as long as a rare excitement<br>stirs your spirit and your body.<br>Laistrygonians and Cyclops,<br>wild Poseidon\u2014you won\u2019t encounter them<br>unless you bring them along inside your soul,<br>unless your soul sets them up in front of you. <br><br>Hope the voyage is a long one.<br>May there be many a summer morning when,<br>with what pleasure, what joy,<br>you come into harbors seen for the first time;<br>may you stop at Phoenician trading stations<br>to buy fine things,<br>mother of pearl and coral, amber and ebony,<br>sensual perfume of every kind\u2014<br>as many sensual perfumes as you can;<br>and may you visit many Egyptian cities<br>to gather stores of knowledge from their scholars.<br> <br>Keep Ithaka always in your mind.<br>Arriving there is what you are destined for.<br>But do not hurry the journey at all.<br>Better if it lasts for years,<br>so you are old by the time you reach the island,<br>wealthy with all you have gained on the way,<br>not expecting Ithaka to make you rich.<br><br>Ithaka gave you the marvelous journey.<br>Without her you would not have set out.<br>She has nothing left to give you now.<br><br>And if you find her poor, Ithaka won\u2019t have fooled you.<br>Wise as you will have become, so full of experience,<br>you will have understood by then what these Ithakas mean. <br><br>What he basically says is that the destination isn&#39;t important, but the journey towards it is, and you need to try to power through the obstacles, avoid setting them up yourself, and never lose hope. But you don&#39;t have to reach Ithaka, or any Ithaka for that matter. A failure can be a lot more glorious than many successes.<br><br>Most of us really can&#39;t do what you do, for example, we mainly don&#39;t have your charisma. Aside from the hard work, there is something to be also attributed to luck, from genetics, the home you were raised in, to a roll of a die, and that&#39;s perfectly ok. But after 20 minutes of writing this, I still don&#39;t have the time and the courage to finish all the work I have to do for this, yet another, 14-hour workday of running university research projects. Maybe I can&#39;t, but please acknowledge that this is also fine, if you&#39;ve managed to at least get something useful out of it, even if you fail.<br><br>Christos", "comment_date": "2018-06-20T19:49:17Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "PW", "comment_text": "Insane", "comment_date": "2018-06-20T19:47:46Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "red. honeysticks", "comment_text": "...

I know it is not a complete explanation, but i have the idea that because the low pressure spots are kind of a single spot where all the material is sucked into, but this spot already has a velocity going outwards. Because of this all the material is sucked into one point, it will be a high pressure point and maybe from that single high pressure point moving outwards the most &quot;obvious&quot; (I am not really sure) option is to form a ring.

In my mind the mini vortexes are actually very easily explained. In theory. No idea how this math would work. First, let&#39;s start with the expanding ring.

The high pressure zone wants to equalize, and so (assuming an equal pressure and particle dispersion throughout the vortex) it begins to suck itself into its own low pressure zone at equidistant point.. The pressure ring begins to collapse into pressure points.. marbles of moving fluid. Now, just like letting a marble fall through water, it creates a vortex around it. This vortex creates the smaller rings. They don&#39;t visible form more smaller rings from that vortex because these smaller vortexes are not uniform enough, and possibly because there is not enough energy left in the system by this point.", "comment_date": "2018-06-20T17:14:19Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Relax Anytime", "comment_text": "overcoming my credit card bills", "comment_date": "2018-06-20T17:14:14Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Perseus", "comment_text": "this was so cool.

I could watch that all day! (i&#39;m sure you have!)<br>I had a few thoughts and just had to get them out... The electro-chemical interactions may not be available in the purely fluid dynamics model.<br>Maybe you could try adjusting the pH of your fluid. My guess is high pH would strengthen the interaction because the dyes would have a heavier negative charge.<br>The charge on your dye molecules may be critical in controlling their interaction with each other when they collide.<br>Dielectric strength of your fluid comes to mind. Low dielectric (low salt) may be important since we are dealing with moving charges. It may be interesting to vary salt in the fluid.<br>The rotating dye molecules probably rotate in backwards circles at 90 degrees to the rings.<br>This is a moving charge which causes an electric current in the ring and a magnetic field, this back rotation speed might be critical.<br>Did you measure the distance between ringlets? These most likely are forming at nodes of positive and negative interference when the rings collide. These may turn 90 degrees to the main ring due to the direction of the electromagnetic fields formed by these moving charged dye molecules in the ringlets. These nodes form a wavelength, it might be safe to assume that it is a sound wave. From this you can get a frequency. Your smoke ring generator may need to be the right size and shape to impart a musical tone or frequency to the ring.<br>That&#39;s all I got.  It might look really awesome with fluorescent dyes.
