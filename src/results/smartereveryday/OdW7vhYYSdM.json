In my years of using my saw almost daily to make my living I have only had two kickbacks, both of which I rightly predicted were about to happen.<br>Now I&#39;m not a big guy, 5&#39; 10&quot; 150 lbs,  I am fairly strong for my size I think having worked with my hands my whole life, my grandpa called it farmers strength lol. <br>My point is, both of my kickbacks I simply braced my arm for the impact and completely arrested the saw, both times the piece I was cutting exploded and splintered away from me and the saw remained motionless.<br><br>So that&#39;s some background, now on to my question:<br>What are the odds that these two events were just very minor kickbacks and is it possible for the forces to just be too much for any human to resist? We&#39;re my events not catastrophic because, based on my shear experience with the tool I was able to predict the event and brace for it? Certainly that is a factor. But being safety conscious, I&#39;m looking for opinions about whether these were just very minor kickbacks compared to what is possible. <br>I understand that not everyone that uses a saw has the benefit of being as experienced as I am, or is as strong as I am because of the life and career I chose, so maybe they&#39;re more dangerous to others?  <br>Asking because my second kickback was a few days ago and I figure this channel probably has some people that are smarter than me about such things. <br>Any opinions, stories, or advice would be greatly appreciated.<br>Thanks", "comment_date": "2022-08-14T12:39:51Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Yaseen Ali", "comment_text": "Is it loud", "comment_date": "2022-08-02T06:10:14Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Ryme Erickson", "comment_text": "A HANDHELD SAW STOP?!?!!

It&#39;s almost completely avoidable.  The only times I&#39;ve had a saw try and kick was when I had done something stupid in terms of supporting the wood I&#39;m cutting or the placement of the saw.   As he shows in this video it mainly happens when the wood falls in and pinches the blade.  The vast majority of the time you can avoid this by properly supporting the work.    But there are awkward situations where you need to cut things..  Dimensional lumber can often have internal stresses that make the wood move once cut. Or it can be cupped/bowed/twisted.   (these only really come into play when you are making a rip cut)<br>2.  Know when you are doing something dangerous and get a real good grip on the saw:  If you can control the initial kick you can overpower the saw.  But if you let it get loosey goosey on you it&#39;s trouble time.    Keep that blade embedded in the wood till you can turn the saw off! <br>3.  Plan for failure.

Having the kickback be simulated with the tool just dangling from a chain doesnt seem to consider these extra forces in a real world situation.

Also properly securing the material you are cutting is an important step I feel most do not do and is dangerous. When making a long cut backing up and going forward also cuts some of the material away as it tries to close together. Worn blades are another mistake I see a lot. Some blades also have a sort of non stick coating on the sides of the blade to help prevent it from grabbing. Setting the correct cut depth is important.

This feature is great and all but in a professional product, I don\u2019t want my saw randomly stopping due to a false alarm. Even without this feature, the blade guard (which you had taken off or tied back) would cover the blade before it could hit you. What operators of a circular saw should be more worried about it preventing kickback in the first place. I understand it\u2019s not always preventable but normally it\u2019s because the blade binds because of a lack of support on the cut off end. If the operator set up and took time to think about safety before the cut, we wouldn\u2019t have to rely on a feature like this, but have it as a backup. Just because there is a feature to keep you from hurting yourself if your using the tool wrong, doesn\u2019t mean we should stop  taking the time to think about the cut before you cut. That\u2019s why the saying goes \u201cthink twice, cut once\u201d. Not just because you don\u2019t want to cut the wrong size, but also because you need to think about if the tool is being used in a safe manner.

As a carpenter of over 30 yrs, kick back only occurred when my mind was not concentrating on the job at hand. (A) Your riving knife has been removed. To prevent binding,  a piece of metal (called the riving knife) is secured behind the blade to prevent the wood binding the blade. On longer cuts, a wedge can be placed into the cut to hold the timber apart. (B)  The spring loaded blade guard seems to have been disabled. As soon as the blade leaves the timber, the guard is designed to spring back, covering the blade. Check the spring action. Note, knocks and bangs can cause the guard to be bent and not work correctly. (C) NEVER start any tool with the blade in contact with the material. This is the reason for the majority of kick backs with all power tools. Move the blade away from the material, allow the tool to reach working speed before bringing it into contact with the material. (D) Learn how to use tools safely, and be aware of the material you are cutting. Circular saws should always be held firmly with two hands. Never stand behind the blade, your body should be at 90 degrees to the blade,  moving along the workpiece as you cut. Ensure that your path beside you material is clear to walk - remove debris or cables that may trip you up. To keep the power cable for the tool you are using out of your way, my teacher taught us to drape it over the shoulder, - prevents cutting the cable or tripping over it. (E) Allow the tool to cut at it&#39;s own speed. Never force the blade to cut quicker than it is designed to. This will blunt the tool quicker, and may cause kick back. Harder materials or deeper cuts will require more time to cut.  <br>All power tools are dangerous if not used correctly. Knowing how to use a tool correctly removes most of that danger (except for spindle moulders, even professionals can get caught out). A great concept for DIY builders, but I doubt it will get fitted to professional tools, as learning how to use the tool properly will negate the need for extra cost.

This actually happened to someone I worked with. They wore gloves with an electric torque gun. The glove had a string sticking out which got caught up as the torque gun was spinning. Instead of letting go of the trigger the person gripped the gun even harder. The finger became amputated.  So a solution is something called a deadman switch. It&#39;s a 3 position switch OFF-ON-OFF. It&#39;s off when not in use, you squeeze it to operate the saw in this case, and when you detect there might be a kickback you press harder into the 3rd OFF position again...

If you lock that guard up you are giving the saw the power to hurt you.  The way that you explain kickback on how you are cutting is the incorrect way to use this saw.  My additional advice to consumers is if you are nervous still to use this saw look at at track saw which will give you a much more accurate cut and safer.  Also some of the track saws have a splitter that prevents kickback. <br><br>It blows me a way that you guys are going to market a product that prevents an accident when you are using a tool incorrectly and you have disabled its safety device.", "comment_date": "2019-12-26T23:22:05Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "P F", "comment_text": "One like for the high five (and not high four...) \ud83d\ude06", "comment_date": "2019-12-25T16:41:47Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Juan David Guerrero", "comment_text": "Whose blood is it on the top left corner at <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OdW7vhYYSdM&amp;t=8m00s\">8:00</a>?", "comment_date": "2019-12-24T16:01:35Z", "likes_count": 6}, {"comment_by": "AFugy", "comment_text": "no thanks", "comment_date": "2019-12-24T00:55:21Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "VK Yap", "comment_text": "I think kickback control for all power tool should be implemented even enforced because it&#39;s quite terrible and extremely dangerous.", "comment_date": "2019-12-23T18:01:07Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "testing beta7", "comment_text": "WOW", "comment_date": "2019-12-22T09:56:34Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Robin Smith", "comment_text": "Where is the blade guard?", "comment_date": "2019-12-20T22:02:00Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Designer- Garb", "comment_text": "It&#39;s a hard sell to manufacturers that have to increase the costs of their products to include this new tech, now if the safety laws were changed they would all be banging on your door.", "comment_date": "2019-12-20T12:39:07Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Travis Obryan", "comment_text": "I&#39;ve got my daughter with me in my car every day 10 mins going and 10 mins coming home from school.

However in more complex cases where you cannot really derive a logic by yourself machine learning can really be an effective way of doing it. But in general it usually it is better to come up with your own logic, since machine learning has its own set of quirks. Especially for safety applications it is preferably since you can never really know whiche logic was learned by the machine. Btw a good training of e.g. given a neural network will be really costly too.<br><br>E.g. if you use a machine learning algorithm for this and you only record kickbacks at 0 degree cutting it could not at all work at 45 degree cutting. Or if you cutting on a non even surface it could either behave radically or not at all. Of course those things can happen also with a selfmade logic however you at least can deduct where the error in your logic was and how to improve that. You mostly cannot deduct the origin of the problem with a trained algorithm, you might be able to improve it by adding the problematic scenario to your training data, but still you cannot know if this will fix this problem for all kinds of angles, materials and blades.<br><br>Taking this all together it seems to me that a machine learning algorithm will bring more problems with it than it solves for this particular (relatively simple) case. I am also pretty sure, that detecting a harsh acceleration backwards plus some other minor factors like the saws body rotation could be pretty good in recognizing a real kickback and even differentiate it from man made shaking. But even if the logic could not differentiate kickbacks and shaking, would it be a problem if someone is prevented from running around with a running saw and shaking it? You even might get simular or slightly better results via ML but it would be a bigger hassle and you just cannot be sure about that, so the classic approach would definitely win for me.

Why not use a simple switch that in engaged when the metal frame is pressed against the wood + the only way to run the motor is having that switch &amp; the trigger engaged? When the thing lifts off, the switch disengages and a breaking routine can be executed by the motor controller. The switch itself can be mechanical or an optical distance (or contact) sensor, both are inexpensive and the second one can have a small range defined as &quot;in contact&quot; to compensate for movement during cutting with minor lifts etc. If you combine two of them at both ends of the shield you can even glide with the saw over the edge of the wood and as long as one of them senses contact the motor can run.

I don&#39;t know if anyone actually reads comments so I&#39;ll keep this low effort, but if you would like some feedback from an actual 20+ year carpenter let me know.  It would be along the lines of: In my experience your scenario is not what actually causes kickback on a real job, though your solution would work in the real job scenarios. The problem you are solving we would call binding.  This is easy to over power with a good arm, and plywood does not do this, per your on screen discussion.  There are already good solution in effect in chainsaws and table saws.  Your approach may be better for hand held saws.  Side fact: you were saying humans can&#39;t react fast enough to let go of the saw in an emergency.  True.  But there is an other thing going on.  There is something in your brain stem that will not let you let go when the sh$# hits the fan.  This is much more of an issue with big, industrial hammer drills.  When those things catch and start to spin they will tear your shoulders apart and you can&#39;t let go.  I always though of this as baby monkey holding moms fur in the trees reaction.  It is a real thing.  You learn to hold the drill in a way that doesn&#39;t use your thumbs so you don&#39;t have the strength to hold it if it starts to spin, so you let go thru weakness and save your shoulders and elbows.  There&#39;s more if you are interested.

Knots you always take it easy, Especially in thin wood as you risk knocking the knot out, Which may not be wanted if for aesthetics. Always keep a very firm grip on the saw no matter how little resistance, I always found that to be the best practice. Some of the saws out there have a small bulge handle on the top of the saw for use of your other hand to counter any kick.

Look up &quot;Dual Blade Buzz Saw&quot; or Dual Blade Circular Saw, or &quot;Counter Rotating Saw&quot;. They use a pair of circular blades that spin in opposite directions, So that when they grip the material being cut, they don&#39;t kick. This solution already exists to the problem, and I feel it&#39;s a safer solution that the one here. As a computer scientist / programmer, I understand ANN programming, and one of the draw backs of intuitive AIs from Artificial Neural Networks is that with large ones, it becomes impossible to verify that it will always be 100% accurate. There is always a chance the network will not behave as you want it to. And we can&#39;t foresee what may cause a network to return a false positive, or in this case much worse, a false negative. <br>Neural networks which train themselves hold their intuitive-like-behavior as their greatest upside as well as their greatest downside. Neural networks, such as the one used by google&#39;s Deep Mind are known for being able to surprise the researchers who created them, because they don&#39;t follow a simple set of instructions designed entirely by the researcher/programmer, and they find their own solutions. This becomes a great upside when you want to solve complex problems that require intuition, but it also becomes a downside when it comes to safety, because you cannot pinpoint the cause of a failure when one happens, nor can you manually go in and edit it to fix a part that causes a false positive/negative. You can only hope that the genetic algorithm (or whatever learning algorithm is used) will find a solution and do so without opening up any new false positives/negatives.", "comment_date": "2019-02-20T10:05:24Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "sixtofive", "comment_text": "Very cool stuff!

So to you I say, I hope you&#39;re right. <br><br>Destin - Very interesting. It seemed that the built-in saw brake had a significant delay before the blade actually came to a stop. Those blades can be very dangerous even if not spinning at full speed. I&#39;d be interested to know from your HS data whether the brake is capable of stopping the blade before it reaches flesh. It looked like at 80-100 ms, the blade is already in a position to do some damage if you had and ill-placed finger in the blade path. (And yes, I know folks, you should not have your hand there in the first place, but guess what, people do it anyway, and they pay the rest of their lives for it). This is an interesting approach that is quite different from SawStop. You are attempting to prevent the dangerous contact in the first place as opposed to minimizing the damage once contact does occur. There are also many comments on here about the spring-loaded blade guard. I&#39;d like to see in your video how quickly a guard would respond under a kickback scenario.

I&#39;m not trying to knock your test, but you&#39;re using fixed parameters.<br>1 hand pressure from holding the saw usually prevents major kickbacks<br>2 once it does kick back, the guard is activated once it kicks up above the cutting surface and that usually stops it from being chaotic<br>3 it seems like what you are implementing is a designated Killswitch. Not all saws, but many of them do you have kill switches as to where it seems optically similar to your technology, stops immediately.<br>Also what kind of price difference would this be adding on to the overall cost of a circular saw and what would that price be compared to saws that already implement a built-in kill switch? I personally use Ridgid tools, I don&#39;t think they use kill switches, I feel like DeWalt might use them. I don&#39;t think most worm drives do, I might be wrong I usually only use those made by Skil.<br>4 so also if your saw going to detect additional stresses which would make it seem like it is in a kickback situation then it would shut off automatically as you want your technology to do. If I&#39;m ripping a 2 x 4 down I will not tolerate a saw that keeps automatically shutting off on me when I&#39;m trying to use it under normal working circumstances. So if you want to implement this  technology you need to have an override shut-off mechanism on whoever&#39;s saw you decide to use this on. And it looks like you&#39;re using a DeWalt, so every time you pull your finger off the trigger it should be stopping automatically, meaning without continual rotation from the kill switch.

I wasn&#39;t using the saw; I was waiting for the boss to finish cutting. I was standing 6-8 feet away, but a small piece hit my face (eyebrow 13 stitches). My eyeball swelled up like a tennis ball sized, ball of butterscotch pudding. As a result, I lost 97% of my vision, BUT since my eyeball STAYED inside my head the workers compensation board only paid the MINUMIN/ temporary. They claimed I could &quot;just use my other eye&quot;, but my other eye hasn&#39;t worked since birth; consequently I lost both my career jobs after two years of TRYING to adjust.  <br>My friend lost his leg when the brush saw ( saw on a pole, used for clearing around new trees) that his partner was using hit a knot in a small tree and bounced back to hit my friends leg. My friend thought he could run passed quickly (to grab his gear), but he was too slow and too close. Big danger when saws &quot;kick-back&quot; or get squeezed, like the video showed. I&#39;ve seen a sliver of wood 3inches by 6-7 feet (from hardwood floors) come off the table saw and fly horizontally, forward threw the air 35ft and bend around the corner of the house to surprise another employee, who was prepared. I&#39;m young but I&#39;ve heard dozens of these stories and seen injuries, from just around here, in my small town. <br>It&#39;s time to get new tools that do specific jobs, cause it&#39;s common that a person will do: ONLY baseboards and needs a SMALLER version of a table saw (like those tiny saws for tiles, that use water, but without the water. A small circular saw, mounted on a base, PLUS with vacuum attachments, (so it&#39;s clean inside the home), on a low wagon, attached to another wagon (or toolbox), for the small pieces of mouldings, level, pencils, nails, sander, Dap, paint, etc! THIS WOULD allow the baseboard to be cut at the site where it is installed, instead of trekking back and forth to the bigger saw, outside. I TRIED to rig up something like this but I don&#39;t have the ingenuity to put it together. But with tools getting cheaper to buy, it&#39;s easier to own six diff saws for hardwood floor install. I have an &quot;UNDERCUT&quot; saw for under the casings &amp; trim on either side of the door. I LOVE using that small, powerful, guy; it&#39;s fast so the blades last forever and it&#39;s Bosch so it came with a case! Nice! I have a plunge router, I made by adding a piece to a Dremel Tool. Awesome for cutting vent/register holes into the floor. Now that they make laser guided circular saws, maybe I can go back to doing something simple, LIKE &quot;Just Baseboards&quot;. <br>It could be, &quot;GIRL With a SAW, Perfect Baseboards Everytime&quot;.

I love the idea, but as a potential\u00a0consumer, I&#39;m skeptical. For anyone who would care, here are my concerns. I will assume that the technology can be implemented with\u00a0next to zero loss in appearance or functionality- <i>exempli gratia,</i>\u00a0these saws won&#39;t be heavier, or have some goofy digital device sticking off the side of them.\u00a0<br><br>First, understand that the actual\u00a0threat of &quot;kickback&quot; in the hands of a capable user is minimal. Two prepared hands will stop a circular\u00a0saw from moving. The bulk of danger with one of these things comes from\u00a0the potential for the guard to stick/fail. A user will naturally develop comfort with a power saw over time. As such, the first time the guard sticks, there is a high probability\u00a0of a close call. This is why a brake is so important.\u00a0Any power saw is loud and intimidating, which is why there is so much fear surrounding its use. The noisy intimidation might act as a red herring that makes us overcorrect for safety, because we might believe that there is danger where there is none. My argument here is\u00a0simply that\u00a0false positives have consequences.\u00a0\u00a0<br><br>Understand that it is a contrivance of the market to promote any\u00a0gimmick that touts &quot;safety,&quot; because there is a natural\u00a0effort to secure positive PR and the appearance of social responsibility. SawStop is the classic case. Their product is extremely overrated, but their positive image has lots of sway on the lay person who would prefer to remain on the side of caution. But the bias\u00a0of the misinformed\u00a0has a funny way of making its way into policy- which, I&#39;m afraid, may eventually lead to manufacturing regulations, which become additional expense to the consumer. Such impositions also become unquestioned design assumptions which then stifle the diversity of engineering techniques available to tool manufacturers.\u00a0The result is\u00a0a market filled with\u00a0cookie-cut, disposable\u00a0tools that are nowhere near optimized for function. From a business perspective, marketability optimization is the preferred\u00a0product line.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0<br><br>Another incursion upon consumer choice and personal liberty comes in the form of patent protection. This is of course a complicated problem, because ideas do have origins, and those originators do have some claim to benefit from their own\u00a0ideas. But as our market runs presently, some types of protection will freeze the market&#39;s ability to adapt to the new\u00a0idea and to then provide healthy competition until the patents expire, as SawStop has done. If it were really about saving fingers, I think SawStop would have taken a\u00a0slightly different approach. But this paragraph is\u00a0telling us\u00a0something we all already knew.<br><br>As a potential consumer, it&#39;s my concern that even a well-intentioned technology has a funny way of being turned into a useless sales pitch-\u00a0<i>especially</i> if that new technology has an opportunity cost of forcing some other aspect of the product to become &#39;shaved off,&#39; to try to compensate for the price of including that new\u00a0technology. For example, cords on saws\u00a0now are cheaper and less flexible than they used to be. This saved manufacturers money, and made the saws cheaper, but with a stiff cord,\u00a0there\u00a0is now a small loss to worker productivity and safety that&#39;s nearly impossible to measure empirically.\u00a0What will this\u00a0new technology displace in order that the price will\u00a0remain reasonable? A cheaper trigger, perhaps? How about a guard spring that has a thinner gauge? These are complicated problems,\u00a0and I don&#39;t think the answer is as unconditionally\u00a0simple as safe=good.\u00a0As such, I post this critique in the hopeful spirit that this technology will be well-implemented and non-invasive. I don&#39;t really expect\u00a0anybody to read this, but that really\u00a0is my hope.\u00a0The idea seems to come from a good place.\u00a0<br><br>Just for noobs:<br>Here are a few lesser-considered risks associated with a power saw: 1) setting the blade unnecessarily deep. This gives the sawblade more exposed\u00a0area, and further, more leverage to cause damage.\u00a02)\u00a0using a dull blade.\u00a0A sharp blade maintains its speed through the cut, so it has less chance of binding. 3) failure to consider the internal stresses of the medium. Wood has an intricate network of internal tensions and compressions. Learning to keep the two halves of the board away from one another while keeping one part stationary and the other free will all but eliminate the possibility of bind/&quot;kickback.&quot; <br><br>And finally, and most importantly: there is no substitute for good procedure. No corrective mechanism for &quot;safety&quot; can replace\u00a0a capable brain.

I&#39;m a 48 year-old contractor who has watched tool after tool being taken over by the safety\u00a0 police at OSHA.\u00a0 Almost without exception, small power tool safety devices make equipment more dangerous for professionals while making them only marginally more safer for homeowners.\u00a0 Many guards for instance require the operator to contort their body in ways that leading to less control over the tool\u00a0 when it gets bound. Similarly, some tools require you to hit multiple buttons to turn them on causing the user to have an excessive grip on the device\u00a0 such that the device\u00a0 becomes less safe during\u00a0 use .\u00a0 This works out well for the manufacturer&#39;s because contractors take the safety devices off of the machines the minute they put them in the service, thus indemnify\u00a0 the manufacturer. But the removal of such devices is becoming more and more difficult to do. For instance, devices that prevent you from using a pneumatic nailer to shoot your buddy from across the room also inevitably cause you to dent finnish material. And the newest line of such products one can&#39;t actually remove the safety plunger. As a result to use the tool properly you actually have to hold the plunger with one finger while you shoot the gun with the other. Occasionally, a nail goes through the wood makes a hundred eighty degree turn and lodges into the finger. This is extremely painful, but the alternative to this happening once or twice every couple of years is putting dents in finished Hardwood on every last job. This is an unacceptable outcome. So my request would be that if you do program such a thing in the device that you put an off switch, similar that used to turn off the airbags on the passenger side of a modern car, so that we don&#39;t have to break open the electronics to fix a bad implementation. If you do this I would definitely consider buying that tool.

Actually it happens with anything that is more wide than long. The grain does not really matter. The reason is that the forward momentum of the saw makes the sides of the board pivot towards the blade and then they grip the blade, that makes the saw grip even harder in the wood and that will increase the radial momentum of the sides of the board, which grips even more onto the blade.

And a human arm (or two) holding a saw has enough weight and muscle memory behind it to control the saw to some extent just from inertia.  A kickback-inducing blade pinch might let the saw climb up out of the cut, perhaps all the way clear of the workpiece, but more likely would just stall or stop the saw.  Unless you&#39;re half asleep and holding it with an exhausted spaghetti arm, or sawing while bracing the board over your thigh or something equally foolish on a Darwinian scale, your arm&#39;s stronger and heavier on the saw than this pendulum chain, and will (even unconsciously) control the force of the kickback before the saw gets near gonads or any other vital parts of the anatomy.  A circular saw really is one of the safer power tools.<br><br>Now a parade of walking wounded will come out of the &#39;woodwork&#39; (no pun intended) to list all their circular-saw-kickback stories and injuries (either real ones, or invented ones for the purpose of this discussion), but I still have yet to see a responsible woodworker using the saw correctly (or even less than correctly) being unable to control a circular saw kickback.  It&#39;s a whole other kind of kickback than the table saw, where a 5,000 rpm motor is launching a projectile at you, or pulling your hand that was guiding the piece into the spinning blade when it walks up on a tooth, before you can react.  Here, you&#39;re holding the much lighter saw itself, no bits of wood being flung at you.  And you (or even your arm) has a lot more inertia through it&#39;s own mass and muscle memory than the circular saw kicking back has.  And I&#39;m not denying there have been circular saw kickback injuries, but what I am saying is that you gotta be doing so many obvious things wrong to get one, you probably should just save yourself the time and saw right across your fingers or thigh bone and be done with it.

You can look down a board and tell 90% of the time if it had knots, bow, crown that will cause that to happen.  Plus it will happen when someone using the saw not straight which binds the blade.  I add a small shim in the kerf as soon as im bout 1-2&quot; from length of the saw.  That helps all reasons that cause it to bind.  Now  anyone who builds houses and large wood project will use  their saw up walls cutting, the end of rigdes, etc.  So 75% of the time the saw is laying flat on saw horse but 25% its not  so i might of missed something but your invention limits the saw to only flat horizontal applications.

In reno work there are many cringe-worthy situations where you&#39;re using circ saws over your head, such as trimming retrofit rafter tails or cutting recesses near a ceiling etc. I specifically use under-powered saws or a weaker battery so that WHEN it does kick I can still hold onto it one handed.

They should be built so you can draw them towards you.  The issue is your rotating cutting surface is being slowed by the material in the WORST area of the blade BY DESIGN.  In chainsaws you don&#39;t cut with the bottom half of the tip of the saw (or any of the tip if you can help it, but not always.  Same in cutoff wheels - if you think of the circular blade as a clock face, you want to be cutting with about 6 to 11 o&#39;clock part of the blade and NOT the front (especially not the front lower quadrant, ie 3 to 6 o&#39;clock) because that causes the blade to kick up and back towards the user if the blade gets pinched or slows down suddenly due to harder material.<br><br><br>This problem would be much easier to solve by reversing the direction of cut while keeping the rotation direction the same.  Make circular saws that you draw towards yourself and then put a dead man switch (ie if the saw kicks, then it will kick AWAY from you and if you lose your grip, the saw blade brake engages and stops the saw).  Much better solution because BY DESIGN if kickback happens, it kicks the saw AWAY from the user (even if the safety brake/dead man switch combo fails the system is intrinsically safer than current saws).<br><br><br>In chainsaws you can&#39;t really swap the way you cut, so chainsaw makers came up with low kickback chains and bump guards to automatically stop the saw if the kickback is enough to cause the saw to jolt.<br><br><br>Secondly, if you make circular saws so that you draw cut with them instead of pushing them forward you&#39;re taking advantage of human instinct - when something goes wrong our reaction is to stiffen our arms to keep the saw away from us.  This works complementary with the direction of kickback to keep the saw away from the operator if kickback happens.  In current circular saws you don&#39;t want to push the saw away because if it catches on the wood again, it will just kick towards you again.  You want to either hold it down, turn it off, or pull it up from the wood and keep hold of it - both of which are not our natural reaction in the moment.<br><br><br>You can tell I&#39;ve thought way too much about this.

One is how to position stock on your cut station. You must know how to position a fulcrum or other supports to control the compression and tension in your material to avoid pinching your blade. The fact that you have the blade guard wide open and effectively disabled seem altogether misleading and makes this seem like a much bigger problem than it actually is. I understand it is to show the blade stopping but if it was functional you would see that the problem is less extreme than you make it appear to be. Especially when you ask to immagine if that was skin. That hazard has been adressed by the blade guard. Only people lazy enough to bypass their guard will be the ones catching a blade. Most if not all close calls I have seen involve cutting material that is not properly supported or too small for them to effectively control the material and the saw. As this is a clever solution I can see this consistently stopping performance of the saw.

I was standing to the side of the blade (like you should) but I had my left hand basically resting on the back edge of the table behind the blade so when that piece took off it went straight to my hand and shattered my pinky knuckle.

So for somebody who is not a carpenter or just beginning, this is a good safety thought with this. So I&#39;m really excited to proceed with the video to see the solution in progress you all have created. <br><br>As a carpenter, when you&#39;re cutting and you know the saws and you know how things like this work it&#39;s a bit different. It&#39;s not necessarily a reaction time you have to deal with. Wood wont just snap shut and shove the saw out, it happens over time and you can hear the saw bogging down and you can feel what the saw is doing with the experience. This also brings to mind the reasoning for making sure when you are cutting you have a good blade that isn&#39;t dull. A dull blade will require more forward force to cut with, so you will bog down the saw and be more likely to run into this issue as you wont be able to feel the resistance from the wood to the saw because you&#39;re plowing the saw through the wood with force instead of guiding the saw through the wood and letting it cut. <br><br>I think where this is super awesome idea as well is if it can be applied to table saws where the danger is far greater of a kick back due to this as you don&#39;t have the hand feel of the saw to know whats going on, you just have the sound the saw is making while your pushing the wood through the saw. <br><br>Still drives me nuts you live just over an hour away.
