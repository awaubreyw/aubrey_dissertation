I had a intro question on it for my MSc, why is the transit of Venus important, to which I answered, it isnt, we can laser sight mercury&#39;s transit for the same data far more frequently, I got zero marks because apparently I was supposed to pretend I&#39;m some 1700 country bumpkin. I hate pointless questions. Its interesting, but its no longer important.", "comment_date": "2012-06-06T15:45:10Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "The Outliers", "comment_text": "some are out of sync", "comment_date": "2012-06-06T15:43:20Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "zxana", "comment_text": "dude you live SOOOO close to me!!! we should meet some time :D", "comment_date": "2012-06-06T15:41:28Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Pies", "comment_text": "in englnd, i didnt get a chance to see it cause its so clougy :&#39;(\n", "comment_date": "2012-06-06T15:39:24Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "robbetheunis", "comment_text": "can you do a video about fire in buildings. i&#39;m reading a book on it now, about how people don&#39;t want to open windows cause of the extra oxygen, but should open windows cause of the explosive building gasses etc. it&#39;s quit interesting", "comment_date": "2012-06-06T15:37:37Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Mina Mahrous", "comment_text": "I didn&#39;t know about this , can&#39;t really find many space news in egypt xD", "comment_date": "2012-06-06T15:26:16Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Gus.", "comment_text": "i watched it on the nasa edge livestream! to be honest it was cloudy in the uk, i had no viewing aids, so it was really nice of nasa to put on the show for me! thanks nasa.
