Thank you sir.\n\nThe Thunderbirds have a YouTube Channel\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UC7_edytVWM8iumngqzTVLVw\n\nThis flight took place on May 3, 2019 in Biloxi Mississippi.  The reason it took so long to release is the high amount of research I wanted to do before releasing the video.  I even visited the Air Force Research Lab at Wright Patterson AFB to discuss some aspects of this video with Aerodynamicists.  Synchronizing all this footage and coordinating additional B Roll with the Thunderbirds Public Affairs Officer also required a lot of effort.  \n\nThese are my own thoughts, not those of the U.S. Air Force or the Thunderbirds:\nI've been around a lot of pilots and ground crew in my life and I must say that the professionalism displayed by the Thunderbirds was astounding.  Their goal is to inspire and demonstrate the capabilities of the US Air Force, so I'll take it a step further.  If you're a smart young person who is interesting in changing your life for the better, strongly consider the Air Force.  The job market isn't the best at the moment but the Air Force still has opportunities available for you to learn incredible skills even if you're not interested in flying.  They manage everything from logistics, electronics, aerospace, cyber and even space systems.  The threats to freedom are becoming more complex, and in my experience working for the Department of Defense over a 15 year span (even longer if you count my work as a contractor) The US Air Force consists of some of the most intelligent service members our country has.  These people are book-smart, but also have the confidence to solve real world problems with their own hands.  If I have a complex aerodynamic question, my first call is usually to someone in the Air Force, because they understand these complex phenomena intuitively.  For example, in this video you would hear Flack and I talking about pitot tubes in flight.  We also had other discussions about fuel burn rates, Prandtl Glauert, weather.... all kinds of things.  Simply put, if you're looking for direction in your life, and you're good with science and math... consider the Air Force.  That being said, they also need other types of skills as well.  Logisticians, writers, creative people who know how to solve complex problems in unique ways.  \n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nGET SMARTER SECTION\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_Dynamics_F-16_Fighting_Falcon\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prandtl%E2%80%93Glauert_transformation\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nGET STUFF SECTION: \n(If I did this right these should be working Amazon affiliate links to purchase the stuff I like  to use.

We made ours in 2018, and Chad visited my house in January 2019 to film most of this.  We didn't post it for various reasons, but decided now might be a good time.  The fidelity of the inference is a function of how you train it.... so obviously the more data points you provide, the better it will perform.  This particular type of machine learning is known as object detection, with the computation being performed by a deep neural network \"on the edge\".

We made ours in 2018, and Chad visited my house in January 2019 to film most of this.  We didn't post it for various reasons, but decided now might be a good time.  The fidelity of the inference is a function of how you train it.... so obviously the more data points you provide, the better it will perform.  This particular type of machine learning is known as object detection, with the computation being performed by a deep neural network \"on the edge\".

Ultimately I decided it was ok to live with dye dripping out of the front.\n\nWe had to premix the dyes and eventually we got there.\n\nIt got to the point where we didn\u2019t even really know what success looked like and always thought we were there.\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nGET STUFF SECTION: \n(If I did this right these should be working Amazon affiliate links to purchase the stuff I like to use.

Ultimately I decided it was ok to live with dye dripping out of the front.\n\nWe had to premix the dyes and eventually we got there.\n\nIt got to the point where we didn\u2019t even really know what success looked like and always thought we were there.\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nGET STUFF SECTION: \n(If I did this right these should be working Amazon affiliate links to purchase the stuff I like to use.

Animating anything for 10 minutes is a big deal so instead of trial and error, he put what he knew about the rules of perspective and made this grid system to line things up, all to make the dots on that map in the corner work like you'd expect them to.\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nTweet ideas to me @SmarterEveryDay\n\nInstead of saving for my kids' college, I make videos using the money I would have saved.\nThe thought is it will help educate the world as a whole, and one day generate enough revenue to pay for their education.

Animating anything for 10 minutes is a big deal so instead of trial and error, he put what he knew about the rules of perspective and made this grid system to line things up, all to make the dots on that map in the corner work like you'd expect them to.\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nTweet ideas to me @SmarterEveryDay\n\nInstead of saving for my kids' college, I make videos using the money I would have saved.\nThe thought is it will help educate the world as a whole, and one day generate enough revenue to pay for their education.

I should note, that Byron doesn't call himself the \"Best\" archer, or the \"Most Amazing\" archer or anything like that.  These are my words, because to me, he really is the most amazing archer.\nHe's a cool dude with the right balance of humility and confidence, and I have an incredible amount of respect for him as a person.  I'm under no obligation to recommend that you hire him for your live event... but I do.  Book him through his wife Wanda here under \"Exhibition Shooting\".\nhttp://www.byronferguson.com/\n\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nGET STUFF SECTION: \n(If I did this right these should be working Amazon affiliate links to purchase the stuff I like to use.

I wasn't \"ACTIVELY\" trying to learn.  Meaning... I wasn't struggling and trying to make my brain learn.  I simply got on the bike every day, tried to operate it to the end of the driveway, turned around and tried to operate it back.  The goal was to understand how my brain figured things out on its own, without trying to force it to.  Many people have built bikes like this and figured it out in much less than 1 day by staying on the bike until they were able to master it.  I had no timelines, and was using this as an exploratory activity to learn how I learn.\n\nDo not misinterpret this to mean that I struggled and tried very hard every day for 8 months.

                "description": "My beautiful wife is forever patient with me.  Ask her the results: https://twitter.com/DestinsBride \nTweet\u2192http://bit.ly/CologneTwT   Post to FB\u2192http://bit.ly/CologneFB\nhttp://www.harrys.com Promo Code: \"SMARTER\"\n\u21ca\u21ca Click below for more info \u21ca\u21ca\n\nIf you'd like to ask my wife what she thought about this experiment feel free to tweet her: https://twitter.com/DestinsBride\n\nIf you did what I do, there's a cool way you can make it easier for me to do it:\nhttp://www.patreon.com/smartereveryday\n\nWill Leahy compiled all the data.\nhttp://willleahy.info\nIf you want to play with the graph, it's here!\nhttp://willleahy.info/SEDcologne/\n\nOutro music by A Shell in the Pit\n\"Bottles\" which can be downloaded here.\nhttps://ashellinthepit.bandcamp.com/track/minke-bottles\n\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nMETHODOLOGY:\n\nMy first attempts with a new cologne would be to just apply it and wait for a comment.  We have busy lives so often she wouldn't say anything.  If one reached out and grabbed her attention (I try to apply only enough for her to smell me when she's close... not like a high school boy who pours it on) I knew it was an interesting scent to her.  I tried to be honest, so many times I would wear one an entire day without a single comment from her.  That was pretty hard to do because I was hungry for data.  Sometimes if the mood was right and we were getting ready or something I'd casually ask what she thought about a certain fragrance.  She's conducted serious biological research projects before so she understood all along the importance of the data set.\n\nSome colognes I only tried once because it was obvious one of us hated it.  Others were kind of in the \"whatever\" region.  Those I would often try multiple times.  Some she really liked one day, but not another.  Those took multiple tries to weed out.  \n\nOften I would go without wearing anything, or perhaps my old aftershave just to make sure she wasn't gaming the system.  The first or second day or so I realized that if she knew the names of the colognes it DRASTICALLY influenced her opinions.  That just goes to show you how powerful marketing is on our perceptions. \n\nAt some points she got confused because she couldn't tell if I was re-wearing something I had tried earlier.  For example, she became a bit self conscious about whether or not she had already told me she liked one...   I could tell she was trying to give me consistent answers, but I kept shifting it up so much I filtered out all her attempts to game the data.  \n\nI also noticed that if I wore one that she complimented or mentioned without being prompted.\n\nIn the end, I'm really happy with what we chose.  It's light and a bit sweet, but still has swagger to it.  I fancy myself a manly man, and I think she likes that about me.  If you want to try to pull the answer out of her, I'm sure she would get a kick out of that. Tweet her at https://twitter.com/DestinsBride and see if you can talk her out of the answer.  If you're a normal supporter, PM me on Patreon and I'll tell you the result.\n\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nGET STUFF SECTION: \n(If I did this right these should be working Amazon affiliate links to purchase the stuff I like  to use.

That just goes to show you how powerful marketing is on our perceptions. \n\nAt some points she got confused because she couldn't tell if I was re-wearing something I had tried earlier.  For example, she became a bit self conscious about whether or not she had already told me she liked one...   I could tell she was trying to give me consistent answers, but I kept shifting it up so much I filtered out all her attempts to game the data.  \n\nI also noticed that if I wore one that she complimented or mentioned without being prompted.\n\nIn the end, I'm really happy with what we chose.  It's light and a bit sweet, but still has swagger to it.  I fancy myself a manly man, and I think she likes that about me.  If you want to try to pull the answer out of her, I'm sure she would get a kick out of that. Tweet her at https://twitter.com/DestinsBride and see if you can talk her out of the answer.  If you're a normal supporter, PM me on Patreon and I'll tell you the result.\n\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nGET STUFF SECTION: \n(If I did this right these should be working Amazon affiliate links to purchase the stuff I like  to use.

Tenured Mechanical Engineering professor at UAH\n\nUAH Director of Hockey Operations Nick Laurila\n\nThe nameless UAH Hockey player \n\nGo Chargers!\n\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nGET SMARTER SECTION\n\nThe stick rigidity data collected by Dr. Evans and I is not a formal reflection on the manufacturers because the sticks were previously used and we could not find an ASTM standard to setup our test. The possibility exists that I put the support positions too close together, which would make the values lower.  The players however gave us the sticks because they were \"so used they were now flimsy\".  Our data reflected this.  If I had it to do over again I would test a new stick vs an old stick.  Kettering University has done some research on this subject and we tried to setup our test apparatus similar to theirs.  They applied the force to the foot of the stick.  We applied the force to the center. http://www.kettering.edu/news/taking-stick-check\n\nI thought this was a great video of a product that has normalized the process by constraining the 1 inch deflection measurement.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2f7SQgn-9I\n\nTweet ideas to me @SmarterEveryDay\n\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nGET STUFF SECTION: \n(If I did this right these should be working Amazon affiliate links to purchase the stuff I like  to use.

Gordon's work is awesome, you should check it out.

Tenured Mechanical Engineering professor at UAH\n\nUAH Director of Hockey Operations Nick Laurila\n\nThe nameless UAH Hockey player \n\nGo Chargers!\n\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nGET SMARTER SECTION\n\nThe stick rigidity data collected by Dr. Evans and I is not a formal reflection on the manufacturers because the sticks were previously used and we could not find an ASTM standard to setup our test. The possibility exists that I put the support positions too close together, which would make the values lower.  The players however gave us the sticks because they were \"so used they were now flimsy\".  Our data reflected this.  If I had it to do over again I would test a new stick vs an old stick.  Kettering University has done some research on this subject and we tried to setup our test apparatus similar to theirs.  They applied the force to the foot of the stick.  We applied the force to the center. http://www.kettering.edu/news/taking-stick-check\n\nI thought this was a great video of a product that has normalized the process by constraining the 1 inch deflection measurement.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2f7SQgn-9I\n\nTweet ideas to me @SmarterEveryDay\n\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nGET STUFF SECTION: \n(If I did this right these should be working Amazon affiliate links to purchase the stuff I like  to use.

We also became friends pretty fast.

He has reminders setup in his phone when local fast food chains have \"Dollar Hot Dog day\".  It's quite funny, but deep down I'm jealous of how clever it is.\n\nRobert Farrell answered my Facebook appeal for Photographers/Videographers in the Milwaukee Wisconsin area and filmed the skaters at the Pettit National ice Center for me.\nHe's a photographer http://www.robertfarrellphotography.com/ \n\n-------------------------------\nWith thanks to:\n\nJR Ginex-Orinion - he helped me by putting the equation in LaTex and giving me a file.

To be clear, we had to go out at night and actively seek out these types of creatures.  You should still go to the Rainforest.. for real.  It was massive fun and I would love to do it again.\nThanks to Rainforest Expeditions for inviting me down, if you'd like to go down to the Amazon Rainforest and see all of this for yourself check them out at http://www.perunature.com\nPhil Torres is the Conservation Biologist in the video who was wise enough to bring his books to the middle of the jungle!

Every man should know this.  We've all heard the \"if it last longer than 4 hours\" advertisements.....this the science behind why 4 hours is so important. Priapism is a real thing and the Brazilian Wandering spider (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brazilian_wandering_spider) can make it happen. \n\nFilmed on location in the Rainforests of Eastern Peru. To be clear, we had to go out at night and actively seek out these types of creatures.  You should still go to the Rainforest.. for real.  It was massive fun and I would love to do it again.\nThanks to Rainforest Expeditions for inviting me down, if you'd like to go down to the Amazon Rainforest and see all of this for yourself check them out at http://www.perunature.com\nPhil Torres is the Conservation Biologist in the video who was wise enough to bring his books to the middle of the jungle!

Please consider sharing by clicking here: http://bit.ly/FLIPPIN_CATS  GiGi was not hurt during the making of this video.  We took great care to make sure she would be safe. Next I'll explain how the physics involved in flipping cats allow us to operate Space Telescopes (Seriously).\nSo as simple of a question as this is, it turns out to be a MAJOR POINT OF STUDY in Physics, Robotics, Space Satellite Control, Weapons Development, Biomedical Engineering, etc.  It's stumped scientists and engineers since Newton's day.  Here's something interesting.  The cat isn't twisting his back.. he's actually BENDING it.  The next video will go into great detail about what's going on there, and explain how it relates to studying the farthest points in the universe (Seriously... the fact that a cat can do this allows us to study the Universe.. no exaggeration).\n\nThe high speed camera used was a Phantom Miro M320S.

                    "description": "High Speed video. Cats. Physics. Weightlessness. Of all my videos, if you don't share this one, you probably never will. Please consider sharing by clicking here: http://bit.ly/FLIPPIN_CATS  GiGi was not hurt during the making of this video.  We took great care to make sure she would be safe. Next I'll explain how the physics involved in flipping cats allow us to operate Space Telescopes (Seriously).\nSo as simple of a question as this is, it turns out to be a MAJOR POINT OF STUDY in Physics, Robotics, Space Satellite Control, Weapons Development, Biomedical Engineering, etc.  It's stumped scientists and engineers since Newton's day.  Here's something interesting.  The cat isn't twisting his back.. he's actually BENDING it.  The next video will go into great detail about what's going on there, and explain how it relates to studying the farthest points in the universe (Seriously... the fact that a cat can do this allows us to study the Universe.. no exaggeration).\n\nThe high speed camera used was a Phantom Miro M320S. Rent one yourself by clicking here: http://bit.ly/ON8gMg  Tell them GiGi the cat sent you\n\nArtist Info:\nGordon McGladdery wrote & Recorded the song \"Long Time, No See\"\nDownload it with vocals here:\nhttp://ashellinthepit.bandcamp.com/track/explain\n\nSarah Xu, a student at the Vancouver Film School made the awesome introduction Drawing.

Your heart's plumbing SIGNIFICANTLY changed with your first breath.  AWESOME huh?\nHave you ever heard of someone \"with a hole in their heart\".  The Foramen Ovale doesn't seal completely causing improper flow.\n\nHere's the verse at the end of the video: http://bit.ly/xSFYDM\n\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nGET SMARTER SECTION: \nMany people seem to be having a problem with Doc's explanation.  I would remind you that he's a Doctor and is qualified to make these statements.  We made that cut several times, and I asked him to simplify his summary very greatly.  When doing so he didn't include descriptions of meconium, pulmonary pressure differentials, etc.  These were discussed in detail, but I chose to leave them out and only focus on the foramen ovale and ductus arteriosis.   We also used the term \"breathe\" loosely when the baby is inside the womb because there isn't an oxygen exchange in the baby's lungs with amniotic fluid.  \n\nBabies do \"inhale\" and \"exhale\" amniotic fluid:\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amniotic_fluid#Functions_of_amniotic_fluid\nhttp://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007%2F978-88-470-1402-2_5?LI=true\n\nBabies do defecate in the womb:\nhttp://www.ajog.org/article/S0002-9378(02)71437-3/abstract\n\nA special thanks to Wayne for filming the scene with Dr. Schuster and operating camera focus on the scene with engineering paper.\n\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nGET STUFF SECTION: \n(If I did this right these should be working Amazon affiliate links to purchase the stuff I like  to use.

                    "description": "Click this to share on facebook: http://on.fb.me/1stBreath\n\nYou went from breathing liquid to air at birth.  Why did you not die?  Answer?  Your heart's plumbing SIGNIFICANTLY changed with your first breath.  AWESOME huh?\nHave you ever heard of someone \"with a hole in their heart\".  The Foramen Ovale doesn't seal completely causing improper flow.\n\nHere's the verse at the end of the video: http://bit.ly/xSFYDM\n\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nGET SMARTER SECTION: \nMany people seem to be having a problem with Doc's explanation.  I would remind you that he's a Doctor and is qualified to make these statements.  We made that cut several times, and I asked him to simplify his summary very greatly.  When doing so he didn't include descriptions of meconium, pulmonary pressure differentials, etc.  These were discussed in detail, but I chose to leave them out and only focus on the foramen ovale and ductus arteriosis.   We also used the term \"breathe\" loosely when the baby is inside the womb because there isn't an oxygen exchange in the baby's lungs with amniotic fluid.  \n\nBabies do \"inhale\" and \"exhale\" amniotic fluid:\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amniotic_fluid#Functions_of_amniotic_fluid\nhttp://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007%2F978-88-470-1402-2_5?LI=true\n\nBabies do defecate in the womb:\nhttp://www.ajog.org/article/S0002-9378(02)71437-3/abstract\n\nA special thanks to Wayne for filming the scene with Dr. Schuster and operating camera focus on the scene with engineering paper.\n\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nGET STUFF SECTION: \n(If I did this right these should be working Amazon affiliate links to purchase the stuff I like  to use.

She's getting is pretty well.  We're starting to test matchbox cars to see which is the fastest and things like that.  \n\nif you are interested in helping us via a microscholarship (very micro) contact me for more info.\n\nAlso, after seeing my \"design\" another user, Jeremiahjw was inspired to create his own chicken steadicam.

I shot the video about three months ago and just now edited it down.  \n\nThe micro camera website mentioned above has lots of examples of what this camera is an how to operate it.  You'd be pretty amazed how many uses there are for one.\n\nI hope you enjoy!  If you enjoy my stuff, I would appreciate it if you subscribe!  I've also posted another video which investigates the \"Backdriven reflex\" in more depth.  It can be viewed here:\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvPhBJpCeGg\n\nPeople are often worried about how tight the binder was on the chicken's head.  You'll note I said \"without hurting the chicken\".  I stretched the binder out so it had a very light clamping force.  \n\nAlso, this video inspired another user, Jeremiahjw to create his own chicken powered steadicam.  His video can be seen here:\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adlgpovEv7g&feature=email\n\nPennywhistle Productions.\n\n\nIf you enjoy Smarter Every Day and would like to help me come one step closer to sending the kids to college click here: http://bit.ly/MicroScholarship4MyKids\n\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nGET SMARTER SECTION:",

                    "description": "http://twitter.com/#!/SmarterYoutube\n\n\nClick to share via Facebook!---- http://on.fb.me/CHICKENCAM -----\n\n\nI waited a couple of years for someone to make this video, so I finally decided to do it myself. I shot the video about three months ago and just now edited it down.  \n\nThe micro camera website mentioned above has lots of examples of what this camera is an how to operate it.  You'd be pretty amazed how many uses there are for one.\n\nI hope you enjoy!  If you enjoy my stuff, I would appreciate it if you subscribe!  I've also posted another video which investigates the \"Backdriven reflex\" in more depth.  It can be viewed here:\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvPhBJpCeGg\n\nPeople are often worried about how tight the binder was on the chicken's head.  You'll note I said \"without hurting the chicken\".  I stretched the binder out so it had a very light clamping force.  \n\nAlso, this video inspired another user, Jeremiahjw to create his own chicken powered steadicam.  His video can be seen here:\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adlgpovEv7g&feature=email\n\nPennywhistle Productions.\n\n\nIf you enjoy Smarter Every Day and would like to help me come one step closer to sending the kids to college click here: http://bit.ly/MicroScholarship4MyKids\n\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nGET SMARTER SECTION:"

The pain-o-meter is a real-time reflection of the pain signal sent through the nerves in my legs.  It was measured through the insertion of a small needle probe hooked up to a galvanometer.  No, I'm not serious.\r\n2. The anesthesia didn't 'take' on the right toe because it was so infected.  Lack of bloodflow prevented the good stuff from getting to where it needed to go.\r\n3. I am filming.\r\n4. Why would I upload this?  Because it's awesome.\r\n5. I've had problems with these for years, this was an attempt to finally solve the problem.\r\n\r\nPennywhistle Productions",

The pain-o-meter is a real-time reflection of the pain signal sent through the nerves in my legs.  It was measured through the insertion of a small needle probe hooked up to a galvanometer.  No, I'm not serious.\r\n2. The anesthesia didn't 'take' on the right toe because it was so infected.  Lack of bloodflow prevented the good stuff from getting to where it needed to go.\r\n3. I am filming.\r\n4. Why would I upload this?  Because it's awesome.\r\n5. I've had problems with these for years, this was an attempt to finally solve the problem.\r\n\r\nPennywhistle Productions"

                "description": "http://twitter.com/#!/SmarterYoutube\r\n\r\nPennywhistle Productions\r\n\r\nMy sister covers \"Brand New key\" by Melanie Safka (from the 70s).  \r\n\r\nAll Music (guitar x 2, djembe, eggs, shotgun, vocals) was created by Briley in seperate video tracks then edited together.  My favorite part is the bicycle \"all around the world\" scene in the background.  It's a combination of stopmotion and green screen chroma keying.\r\n\r\nThe video was created with the use of a home-made green screen in my garage,  Stop Motion software called i-StopMotion, Final Cut Express, Garage Band, an Ipod and a talented Sister.  \r\n\r\nShe plays Acoustic Guitar, Djembe, percussion eggs, and a Mossberg Shotgun.  \r\n\r\nMeine Schwester spielt eine Coverversion des Liedes \"Brand New Key\" von Melanie Safka (aus den 70er Jahren).\r\n\r\nDie gesamte Musik (2x Gitarre, Djembe, Perkussioneier, Schrotflinte und Gesang) wurde von Briley in einzelnen Videos gespielt und dann zusammen geschnitten. Meine Lieblingsstelle ist die \"Mit-Fahrrad-durch-die-ganze-Welt\"-Szene im Hintergrund. Das ist eine Kombination von Stop-Motion- und Green-Screen-Aufnahmen im Chromakey-Verfahren.\r\n\r\nDas Video wurde erstellt mit der Benutzung eines selbstgebauten Green-Screens in meiner Garage, einer Stop-Motion-Software namens i-StopMotion, Final Cut Express, einer Garagenband, einem Ipod und einer talentierten Schwester.\r\n\r\nSie spielt Akustikgitarre, Djembe, Perkussioneier und eine Mossberg Schrotflinte.\r\n\r\nMa soeur reprend \"Brand New Key\" de Melanie Safka (des ann\u00e9es 70).\r\n\r\nToute la partie musicale (guitare x2, djembe, oeufs, fusil, chant) a \u00e9t\u00e9 enregistr\u00e9e par Briley sur des pistes vid\u00e9o distinctes ensuite assembl\u00e9es au montage. Mon passage favori est la sc\u00e8ne de la bicylette \"partout dans le monde\" en arri\u00e8re-plan. C'est une combinaison entre techniques de stop-motion et de chroma key fond vert.\r\n\r\nCette vid\u00e9o a \u00e9t\u00e9 r\u00e9alis\u00e9e gr\u00e2ce \u00e0 une toile verte maison tir\u00e9e dans mon garage, aux logiciels i-StopMotion, Final Cut Express et Garage Band, un Ipod ainsi qu'\u00e0 une soeur talentueuse.\r\n\r\nElle joue avec une guitare acoustique, un djembe, des oeufs percussion et un fusil Mossberg.\r\n\r\nFrench Translation courtesy of: PiPoCoeur \r\n\r\nLooking for translations of this description in all languages.\r\n\r\nPennywhistle Productions",

                    "description": "http://twitter.com/#!/SmarterYoutube\r\n\r\nPennywhistle Productions\r\n\r\nMy sister covers \"Brand New key\" by Melanie Safka (from the 70s).  \r\n\r\nAll Music (guitar x 2, djembe, eggs, shotgun, vocals) was created by Briley in seperate video tracks then edited together.  My favorite part is the bicycle \"all around the world\" scene in the background.  It's a combination of stopmotion and green screen chroma keying.\r\n\r\nThe video was created with the use of a home-made green screen in my garage,  Stop Motion software called i-StopMotion, Final Cut Express, Garage Band, an Ipod and a talented Sister.  \r\n\r\nShe plays Acoustic Guitar, Djembe, percussion eggs, and a Mossberg Shotgun.  \r\n\r\nMeine Schwester spielt eine Coverversion des Liedes \"Brand New Key\" von Melanie Safka (aus den 70er Jahren).\r\n\r\nDie gesamte Musik (2x Gitarre, Djembe, Perkussioneier, Schrotflinte und Gesang) wurde von Briley in einzelnen Videos gespielt und dann zusammen geschnitten. Meine Lieblingsstelle ist die \"Mit-Fahrrad-durch-die-ganze-Welt\"-Szene im Hintergrund. Das ist eine Kombination von Stop-Motion- und Green-Screen-Aufnahmen im Chromakey-Verfahren.\r\n\r\nDas Video wurde erstellt mit der Benutzung eines selbstgebauten Green-Screens in meiner Garage, einer Stop-Motion-Software namens i-StopMotion, Final Cut Express, einer Garagenband, einem Ipod und einer talentierten Schwester.\r\n\r\nSie spielt Akustikgitarre, Djembe, Perkussioneier und eine Mossberg Schrotflinte.\r\n\r\nMa soeur reprend \"Brand New Key\" de Melanie Safka (des ann\u00e9es 70).\r\n\r\nToute la partie musicale (guitare x2, djembe, oeufs, fusil, chant) a \u00e9t\u00e9 enregistr\u00e9e par Briley sur des pistes vid\u00e9o distinctes ensuite assembl\u00e9es au montage. Mon passage favori est la sc\u00e8ne de la bicylette \"partout dans le monde\" en arri\u00e8re-plan. C'est une combinaison entre techniques de stop-motion et de chroma key fond vert.\r\n\r\nCette vid\u00e9o a \u00e9t\u00e9 r\u00e9alis\u00e9e gr\u00e2ce \u00e0 une toile verte maison tir\u00e9e dans mon garage, aux logiciels i-StopMotion, Final Cut Express et Garage Band, un Ipod ainsi qu'\u00e0 une soeur talentueuse.\r\n\r\nElle joue avec une guitare acoustique, un djembe, des oeufs percussion et un fusil Mossberg.\r\n\r\nFrench Translation courtesy of: PiPoCoeur \r\n\r\nLooking for translations of this description in all languages.\r\n\r\nPennywhistle Productions"

Our bodies use a gyro-like mechanism in our ears which has 3 mutually orthogonal inertial measurement devices.  Modern motion processors use something called an Inertial Measurment Unit (IMU).  These devices provide movement data which can be used to compensate for the movement.  Chickens apparently have the same type mechanism only with a higher update rate.\n\n*Update* The chickens were eaten by the family dog.  WHOOPS!  :(\n\n*Update #2* Sis and I are shot a music video. If you're interested search for \"Briley brand new key\"\n\n*Update #3*\nCurrently under non-exclusive license to be played on Fuji-TV in Japan.  Ha Ha.  Who would have thought?\n\n*Update #4* July 10th, 2009   1 MILLION HITS Woo Hoo!\n\n* Update #5 Sep 25th 2013  This idea was used in a commercial by Mercedes: \"Mercedes-Benz TV: MAGIC BODY CONTROL TV commercial \"\n\n~~~~~~~~ German / Deutsch  courtesy of Bursaap ~~~~~\nH\u00fchner haben eine bermerkenswertige F\u00e4higkeit ihre K\u00f6pfe stabil zu halten. Unsere K\u00f6rper benutzen ein gyroskopisches Mechanismus das drei gegenseitige senkrechte biomechanische Inertialsensore. Moderne bewegungs Prozessoren benutzen einen sogennanten Inertial Measurement Unit, eine art Inertialsensor. Diese Ger\u00e4te geben Daten an so dass es m\u00f6glich ist die Bewegnung auszugleichen. H\u00fchner haben anscheinend das selbe Biomechanismus aber mit h\u00f6hreren aktualisierungs H\u00e4ufigkeit.\n*Update* Die H\u00fchner wurden bei dem Familienhund gefressen! OOOPS \uf04c\n\n*Update #2* Meine Schwester und Ich haben ein Musikvideo aufgenommen. Wenn es Sie interresiert suchen Sie \"Briley brand new key\"\n\n*Update #3*\nDieses Video wird in Japan auf Fuji-TV Spielen. Ha Ha. Wer h\u00e4tte es gedacht?\n\n*Update #4* July 10th, 2009 Eine Million hits! Geil!\n\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\n\nInstead of saving for my kids' college, I make videos using the money I would have saved.\nThe thought is it will help educate the world as a whole, and one day generate enough revenue to pay for their education.  Until then if you appreciate what you've learned in this video and the effort that went in to it, please share the video.

                    "description": "Post to your facebook -- http://on.fb.me/CHICKNMAN\n\nPennywhistle Productions/Smarter Every Day\n\nChickens have a great ability to keep their heads stable.  Our bodies use a gyro-like mechanism in our ears which has 3 mutually orthogonal inertial measurement devices.  Modern motion processors use something called an Inertial Measurment Unit (IMU).  These devices provide movement data which can be used to compensate for the movement.  Chickens apparently have the same type mechanism only with a higher update rate.\n\n*Update* The chickens were eaten by the family dog.  WHOOPS!  :(\n\n*Update #2* Sis and I are shot a music video. If you're interested search for \"Briley brand new key\"\n\n*Update #3*\nCurrently under non-exclusive license to be played on Fuji-TV in Japan.  Ha Ha.  Who would have thought?\n\n*Update #4* July 10th, 2009   1 MILLION HITS Woo Hoo!\n\n* Update #5 Sep 25th 2013  This idea was used in a commercial by Mercedes: \"Mercedes-Benz TV: MAGIC BODY CONTROL TV commercial \"\n\n~~~~~~~~ German / Deutsch  courtesy of Bursaap ~~~~~\nH\u00fchner haben eine bermerkenswertige F\u00e4higkeit ihre K\u00f6pfe stabil zu halten. Unsere K\u00f6rper benutzen ein gyroskopisches Mechanismus das drei gegenseitige senkrechte biomechanische Inertialsensore. Moderne bewegungs Prozessoren benutzen einen sogennanten Inertial Measurement Unit, eine art Inertialsensor. Diese Ger\u00e4te geben Daten an so dass es m\u00f6glich ist die Bewegnung auszugleichen. H\u00fchner haben anscheinend das selbe Biomechanismus aber mit h\u00f6hreren aktualisierungs H\u00e4ufigkeit.\n*Update* Die H\u00fchner wurden bei dem Familienhund gefressen! OOOPS \uf04c\n\n*Update #2* Meine Schwester und Ich haben ein Musikvideo aufgenommen. Wenn es Sie interresiert suchen Sie \"Briley brand new key\"\n\n*Update #3*\nDieses Video wird in Japan auf Fuji-TV Spielen. Ha Ha. Wer h\u00e4tte es gedacht?\n\n*Update #4* July 10th, 2009 Eine Million hits! Geil!\n\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\n\nInstead of saving for my kids' college, I make videos using the money I would have saved.\nThe thought is it will help educate the world as a whole, and one day generate enough revenue to pay for their education.  Until then if you appreciate what you've learned in this video and the effort that went in to it, please share the video.
