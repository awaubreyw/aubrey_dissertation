But as we\u2019ll see, this perspective is only one way to compare countries on the global stage, has strong ties to colonialist histories, and doesn\u2019t necessarily capture a place\u2019s environmental and socioeconomic sustainability or even the population\u2019s general happiness. We\u2019ll focus on the region in the Middle East and North Africa, called MENA, and examine how the histories of the United Arab Emirates and Lebanon have resulted in drastically different development scores. \n\n[Sources]\nGeneral\nGetis, Bjelland, and Getis.

                    "description": "Empire, imperialism, and colonialism are all interrelated tactics of geopolitics that are used to achieve similar goals of one state maintaining economic, political, or even cultural dominance over other territories. Today, we\u2019re going to unravel the impacts of colonialism at different times throughout history from Taiwan to Myanmar as we examine the longstanding impacts of these relationships. We\u2019ll also take a look at how some countries today, like Thailand, have taken the control of the narrative through culinary colonization. \n\nSOURCES\n\nGeneral:\nGetis, Bjelland, and Getis.

Hundreds of poor Black men from Macon County, Alabama were enrolled in the study, and  treatment for syphilis was withheld from them. Even after antibiotics became available that could cure syphilis, these men were left to suffer from the disease and to expose their families to syphilis as well. Today we're learning about the Tuskegee Syphilis Experiment,  a shameful example of racism in American medicine, and a tragedy that still impacts how many Black Americans think about healthcare today.\n\nClint's book, How the Word is Passed is available now! https://bookshop.org/a/3859/9780316492935\n\nVIDEO SOURCES\n\n\u25cf   Susan Reverby, Examining Tuskegee: The Infamous Syphilis Study and Its Legacy (Chapel Hill, N.C.: University of North Carolina Press, 2009).\n\u25cf   Susan Reverby ed., Tuskegee\u2019s Truth\u2019s: Rethinking the Tuskegee Syphilis Study (Chapel Hill, N.C.: University of North Carolina Press, 2000).\n\u25cf   Harriet A.

                    "description": "From 1932 to 1972, the United States Public Health Service and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention operated an extremely unethical medical experiment on the effects of outcomes of untreated syphilis. Hundreds of poor Black men from Macon County, Alabama were enrolled in the study, and  treatment for syphilis was withheld from them. Even after antibiotics became available that could cure syphilis, these men were left to suffer from the disease and to expose their families to syphilis as well. Today we're learning about the Tuskegee Syphilis Experiment,  a shameful example of racism in American medicine, and a tragedy that still impacts how many Black Americans think about healthcare today.\n\nClint's book, How the Word is Passed is available now! https://bookshop.org/a/3859/9780316492935\n\nVIDEO SOURCES\n\n\u25cf   Susan Reverby, Examining Tuskegee: The Infamous Syphilis Study and Its Legacy (Chapel Hill, N.C.: University of North Carolina Press, 2009).\n\u25cf   Susan Reverby ed., Tuskegee\u2019s Truth\u2019s: Rethinking the Tuskegee Syphilis Study (Chapel Hill, N.C.: University of North Carolina Press, 2000).\n\u25cf   Harriet A.

In this episode of Crash Course Outbreak Science, we'll look at cooperation on the individual, community, and national scale and see how by working together we can improve outcomes during an outbreak, prevent future outbreaks, and even eradicate disease.\n\nThis episode of Crash Course Outbreak Science was produced by Complexly in partnership with Operation Outbreak and the Sabeti Lab at the Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard\u2014with generous support from the Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation.\n\nEpisode Sources:\nhttps://www.epa.ie/publications/compliance--enforcement/drinking-water/advice--guidance/Advice-Note-No9.pdf\nhttps://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0016085\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7123567/\nhttps://biotech.law.lsu.edu/blaw/bt/smallpox/who/red-book/Chp%2014.pdf\nhttps://ajph.aphapublications.org/doi/full/10.2105/AJPH.92.3.341\n\n***\nWatch our videos and review your learning with the Crash Course App! \nDownload here for Apple Devices: https://apple.co/3d4eyZo\nDownload here for Android Devices: https://bit.ly/2SrDulJ\n\nCrash Course is on Patreon!

By 1970, 52% of Black Americans remained in the South. People moved away for many reasons, including increased opportunity in the more industrial North and West. They sought a relatively safer life away from the lynchings and violence that were concentrated in the South. This Great Migration shaped 20th century America in countless ways, but we're going to try to count some of them in this video. \n\nClint's book, How the Word is Passed is available now! https://bookshop.org/a/3859/9780316492935\n\nVIDEO SOURCES\nhttps://www.cnn.com/politics/live-news/georgia-voting-restrictions-bill-03-25-21/index.html\nDavarian Baldwin, Chicago\u2019s New Negroes: Modernity, the Great Migration, and Urban Black Life (Chapel Hill, NC: University of North Carolina Press, 2007).\nIsabel Wilkerson, The Warmth of Other Suns: The Epic Story of America\u2019s Great Migration (New York: Random House, 2010). \nhttps://www.britannica.com/topic/sharecropping\nThe Origins of Southern Sharecropping, Edward Royce, 1993\n\n\nWatch our videos and review your learning with the Crash Course App! \nDownload here for Apple Devices: https://apple.co/3d4eyZo\nDownload here for Android Devices: https://bit.ly/2SrDulJ\n\nCrash Course is on Patreon!

                    "description": "In 1910, 90% of Black Americans lived in the South. By 1940, around 1.5 million Black Americans had left their homes, and 77% lived in the South. By 1970, 52% of Black Americans remained in the South. People moved away for many reasons, including increased opportunity in the more industrial North and West. They sought a relatively safer life away from the lynchings and violence that were concentrated in the South. This Great Migration shaped 20th century America in countless ways, but we're going to try to count some of them in this video. \n\nClint's book, How the Word is Passed is available now! https://bookshop.org/a/3859/9780316492935\n\nVIDEO SOURCES\nhttps://www.cnn.com/politics/live-news/georgia-voting-restrictions-bill-03-25-21/index.html\nDavarian Baldwin, Chicago\u2019s New Negroes: Modernity, the Great Migration, and Urban Black Life (Chapel Hill, NC: University of North Carolina Press, 2007).\nIsabel Wilkerson, The Warmth of Other Suns: The Epic Story of America\u2019s Great Migration (New York: Random House, 2010). \nhttps://www.britannica.com/topic/sharecropping\nThe Origins of Southern Sharecropping, Edward Royce, 1993\n\n\nWatch our videos and review your learning with the Crash Course App! \nDownload here for Apple Devices: https://apple.co/3d4eyZo\nDownload here for Android Devices: https://bit.ly/2SrDulJ\n\nCrash Course is on Patreon!

And when these natural events cause significant harm to humans, we call them natural disasters. So today we'll explore the ways geographers analyze and track these events, and take a closer look at the human impact of Hurricane Katrina in New Orleans and The Boxing Day Tsunami on the Andaman and Nicobar islands. \n\nWatch our videos and review your learning with the Crash Course App! \nDownload here for Apple Devices: https://apple.co/3d4eyZo\nDownload here for Android Devices: https://bit.ly/2SrDulJ\n\nCrash Course is on Patreon!

They recorded both Earth\u2019s climatic history over several million years and contain clues to its climatic future. By now we hope it\u2019s become clear that the Earth is ever-changing, and glaciers have often been a crucial part of that change from the erratic boulders found in New York City\u2019s Central Park to the beautiful spire of the Matterhorn in the Alps on the border of the Italy and Switzerland. \n\nWatch our videos and review your learning with the Crash Course App! \nDownload here for Apple Devices: https://apple.co/3d4eyZo\nDownload here for Android Devices: https://bit.ly/2SrDulJ\n\nCrash Course is on Patreon!

The Underground Railroad was not literally a railroad. It was a network of people, routes, and safe houses that helped people escape from slavery in the south to freedom in the north. Today we'll talk about the origins of the Underground Railroad, the systems that helped people escape, and the people who helped along the route.\n\nClint's book, How the Word is Passed is available now! https://bookshop.org/a/3859/9780316492935\n\nWatch our videos and review your learning with the Crash Course App! \nDownload here for Apple Devices: https://apple.co/3d4eyZo\nDownload here for Android Devices: https://bit.ly/2SrDulJ\n\nCrash Course is on Patreon!

As the world's population keeps growing, finding ways to provide enough food and water for everyone while supporting a sustainable environment can be tricky!  We'll take a closer look at food chains and how energy is transferred between different trophic levels, follow the trends in human consumption as incomes rise, and talk about the two types of overpopulation as they're related to the planet's carrying capacity.\n\nWatch our videos and review your learning with the Crash Course App! \nDownload here for Apple Devices: https://apple.co/3d4eyZo\nDownload here for Android Devices: https://bit.ly/2SrDulJ\n\nCrash Course is on Patreon!

Today, we'll learn about the role that slavery played in early American economy and how slavery became a legally accepted practice in the first place, and how it contributed to the colony\u2019s early economic success. We'll look at the experiences of Anthony Johnson and John Punch to see how legal precedents that greatly influenced the development of slavery were set.\n\nWatch our videos and review your learning with the Crash Course App! \nDownload here for Apple Devices: https://apple.co/3d4eyZo\nDownload here for Android Devices: https://bit.ly/2SrDulJ\n\nClint's book, How the Word is Passed: https://bookshop.org/a/3859/9780316492935\n\nCrash Course is on Patreon!

You could look at different factors like color, boiling point, melting point, or smell, but the answer still might not be clear. Thankfully, today we have a more precise, higher-tech way of identifying chemicals called Nuclear Magnetic Resonance, or NMR. In this episode of Crash Course Organic Chemistry, we\u2019ll look at how NMR allows us to visualize a molecule as a spectrum, and what the peaks on the spectrum tell us about the structure of the molecule.\n\nEpisode Sources:\nMahdi, J.

                    "description": "If you were given a chemical and told to identify it, how would you go about doing that? You could look at different factors like color, boiling point, melting point, or smell, but the answer still might not be clear. Thankfully, today we have a more precise, higher-tech way of identifying chemicals called Nuclear Magnetic Resonance, or NMR. In this episode of Crash Course Organic Chemistry, we\u2019ll look at how NMR allows us to visualize a molecule as a spectrum, and what the peaks on the spectrum tell us about the structure of the molecule.\n\nEpisode Sources:\nMahdi, J.

Mid-latitude cyclones are huge weather systems that bring day-to-day weather in the mid-latitudes. They're the reason the weather is often unpredictable. We'll focus on the Northern Hemisphere and how these cyclones form along the polar front. Then, we'll shift to tropical cyclones also called hurricanes or typhoons - those smaller spinning vortices of air usually originating in the tropics that can cause widespread damage to coastal communities. We'll talk about the Bhola cyclone, which as of 2021 is the deadliest tropical cyclone in history, and we'll take a closer look at the Sundarbans in the low-lying coastal areas of Bangladesh and India to see how mangroves play a crucial role as a natural ecological barrier to these storms. \n\nWatch our videos and review your learning with the Crash Course App! \nDownload here for Apple Devices: https://apple.co/3d4eyZo\nDownload here for Android Devices: https://bit.ly/2SrDulJ\n\nCrash Course is on Patreon!

Mid-latitude cyclones are huge weather systems that bring day-to-day weather in the mid-latitudes. They're the reason the weather is often unpredictable. We'll focus on the Northern Hemisphere and how these cyclones form along the polar front. Then, we'll shift to tropical cyclones also called hurricanes or typhoons - those smaller spinning vortices of air usually originating in the tropics that can cause widespread damage to coastal communities. We'll talk about the Bhola cyclone, which as of 2021 is the deadliest tropical cyclone in history, and we'll take a closer look at the Sundarbans in the low-lying coastal areas of Bangladesh and India to see how mangroves play a crucial role as a natural ecological barrier to these storms. \n\nWatch our videos and review your learning with the Crash Course App! \nDownload here for Apple Devices: https://apple.co/3d4eyZo\nDownload here for Android Devices: https://bit.ly/2SrDulJ\n\nCrash Course is on Patreon!

Today we\u2019re going to go into the science of where the wind comes from and take a closer look at the major wind systems and pressure belts across the globe. We'll explain how the Coriolis effect causes the winds to curve (and makes air travel a bit more complicated), explore the doldrums and horse latitudes that could stall ships for days, and show the enormous impact the trade winds had on European colonization of the Americas. \n\nSources\n\nBryant, R.H. 1990.

Today we\u2019re going to go into the science of where the wind comes from and take a closer look at the major wind systems and pressure belts across the globe. We'll explain how the Coriolis effect causes the winds to curve (and makes air travel a bit more complicated), explore the doldrums and horse latitudes that could stall ships for days, and show the enormous impact the trade winds had on European colonization of the Americas. \n\nSources\n\nBryant, R.H. 1990.

                "description": "We\u2019ve already learned a bit about substitution reactions in organic chemistry and the two different paths they can follow: SN1 and SN2. In order to better predict the products of a substitution reaction and understand how they work, we need to be able to figure out which mechanism a reaction is likely to follow. In this episode of Crash Course Organic Chemistry, we\u2019ll deepen our knowledge of substitution reactions by looking at factors like substrate structure and reaction conditions to determine whether SN1 or SN2 is the more likely mechanism.\n\nEpisode Sources:\nBrookes, P., Lawley, P.D. \u201cThe Reaction of Mono-and Di-Functional Alkylating Agents with Nucleic Acids,\u201d , Biochem.

                "description": "Traditionally, geography is studied as two interconnected parts: physical geography and human geography. For the first half of this series, we will be focusing on physical geography, which is all about recognizing the characteristics of the environment and the processes that create, modify, and destroy those environments. But remember, human-environment interactions are fundamental to studying geography so we won't be ignoring human impact, it just won't be the primary lens we're using to view the world. Today, we'll explore erosional gullies in Madagascar as we discuss the world's dynamic landscape, the Great Barrier Reef as we introduce the four major earth system (the atmosphere, hydrosphere, lithosphere, and biosphere), and we'll finish with a deep dive into Iceland as we introduce the major realms of physical geography. (These are geographer specializations that you may have heard about like topography, geomorphology, pedology, hydrology, climatology, oceanography, meteorology, and biogeography.) \n\nWatch our videos and review your learning with the Crash Course App! \nDownload here for Apple Devices: https://apple.co/3d4eyZo\nDownload here for Android Devices: https://bit.ly/2SrDulJ\n\nCrash Course is on Patreon!

                    "description": "Traditionally, geography is studied as two interconnected parts: physical geography and human geography. For the first half of this series, we will be focusing on physical geography, which is all about recognizing the characteristics of the environment and the processes that create, modify, and destroy those environments. But remember, human-environment interactions are fundamental to studying geography so we won't be ignoring human impact, it just won't be the primary lens we're using to view the world. Today, we'll explore erosional gullies in Madagascar as we discuss the world's dynamic landscape, the Great Barrier Reef as we introduce the four major earth system (the atmosphere, hydrosphere, lithosphere, and biosphere), and we'll finish with a deep dive into Iceland as we introduce the major realms of physical geography. (These are geographer specializations that you may have heard about like topography, geomorphology, pedology, hydrology, climatology, oceanography, meteorology, and biogeography.) \n\nWatch our videos and review your learning with the Crash Course App! \nDownload here for Apple Devices: https://apple.co/3d4eyZo\nDownload here for Android Devices: https://bit.ly/2SrDulJ\n\nCrash Course is on Patreon!

Maps are incredibly powerful tools and play a crucial role in how we understand the world, but they are also made by people, so it is our job to think critically about how these stories are being presented to us. \n\nWatch our videos and review your learning with the Crash Course App! \nDownload here for Apple Devices: https://apple.co/3d4eyZo\nDownload here for Android Devices: https://bit.ly/2SrDulJ\n\nCrash Course is on Patreon!

Today, we're going to talk about the differences between reference maps and thematic maps, take a closer look at how projections play a part in how we perceive maps, and discuss the role of the cartographer (or map maker) in all of this. Maps are incredibly powerful tools and play a crucial role in how we understand the world, but they are also made by people, so it is our job to think critically about how these stories are being presented to us. \n\nWatch our videos and review your learning with the Crash Course App! \nDownload here for Apple Devices: https://apple.co/3d4eyZo\nDownload here for Android Devices: https://bit.ly/2SrDulJ\n\nCrash Course is on Patreon!

That\u2019s because we don\u2019t just use meaning to figure out what\u2019s going on, we also use context. This episode of Crash Course Linguistics is all about pragmatics, the area of linguistics that deals with context. We\u2019ll cover the four main assumptions we make about context in language, also known as Grice\u2019s Maxims, as well as the ways that languages can use grammar to convey politeness, and the different types of conversational styles within and between languages.\n\nWant even more linguistics?

This episode of Crash Course Linguistics is all about semantics, or the area of linguistics concerned with meaning. We\u2019ll learn about different types of semantic relationships, how different languages define these relationships, as well as different approaches to semantics. And we\u2019ll discover that the humble definition may be more complicated than we think.\n\nWant even more linguistics?

This episode of Crash Course Organic Chemistry is all about nucleophiles and electrophiles, or what happens at those molecular hot spots we\u2019ve been talking about. We\u2019ll also learn about what IR spectra can tell us about reactions, and how cyanide is more than just a poison from mystery stories.

In this episode of Crash Course Organic Chemistry, we're learning all about cyclohexanes, including how rings pucker to relieve strain, the boat and chair conformations, and how ring flips can switch substituents from axial to equatorial. We'll practice a lot of chair flips, but don't flip an actual chair just yet!

Molecules have 3-D shapes that help us understand what they can do. In this episode of Crash Course Organic Chemistry, we\u2019ll learn how orbital hybridization and valence bond theory can help us explain 3D molecular structures and about constitutional and  geometric isomers.\n\nEpisode Sources:\nDiscovery of DNA Double Helix: Watson and Crick | Learn Science at Scitable \nCitation: Pray, L.

Many men were enlisted in the fighting, but the war work had implications for the daily lives of a huge number of Europeans. Women entered the workforce in huge numbers, and for a lot of people, the battles raged through their towns, cities, and even their homes. \n\nIn addition to learning about the homefronts of the war, we're going to look at how the war ended, and how the Paris Peace Conference and the treaties that resulted did little to heal the societal wounds of the war, and in many ways set the stage for the next big war.\n\nSources\n\n-Akin, Yigit.   \u201cWar, Women, and the State: The Politics of Sacrifice in the Ottoman Empire during the First World War,\u201d  Journal of Women\u2019s History.

We'll look at what life was like in the rapidly growing urban centers of Europe, how developments in communication and information distribution influenced the way people saw their leaders and their neighbors, and how women began making strides toward equality in this era.\n\nSources\r\n-Anderson, Harriet.

Search engines can be the sort that serve up a list of results, like during a Google or Bing search, using web crawlers, an inverted index, and measuring stuff like click through and bounce back to figure out what you want to see. They can also be the kind that give you answers, like when you ask Siri or Alexa a question, relying on knowledge bases.

They can also be the kind that give you answers, like when you ask Siri or Alexa a question, relying on knowledge bases.

Unlike some of the techniques we\u2019ve discussed so far, reinforcement learning generally only looks at how an AI performs a task AFTER it has completed it. And when an AI completes that task figuring out when and how to reward an AI, called credit assignment,  is one of the hardest parts of reinforcement learning. So today, we\u2019re going to explore these ideas, introduce a ton of new terms like value, policy, agent, environment, actions, and states and we\u2019ll show you how we can use strategies like exploration and exploitation to train John Green Bot to find things more efficiently next time. \n\nCrash Course AI is produced in association with PBS Digital Studios: \nhttps://www.youtube.com/user/pbsdigitalstudios/videos\n\nCrash Course is on Patreon!

                    "description": "Reinforcement learning is particularly useful in situations where we want to train AIs to have certain skills we don\u2019t fully understand ourselves. Unlike some of the techniques we\u2019ve discussed so far, reinforcement learning generally only looks at how an AI performs a task AFTER it has completed it. And when an AI completes that task figuring out when and how to reward an AI, called credit assignment,  is one of the hardest parts of reinforcement learning. So today, we\u2019re going to explore these ideas, introduce a ton of new terms like value, policy, agent, environment, actions, and states and we\u2019ll show you how we can use strategies like exploration and exploitation to train John Green Bot to find things more efficiently next time. \n\nCrash Course AI is produced in association with PBS Digital Studios: \nhttps://www.youtube.com/user/pbsdigitalstudios/videos\n\nCrash Course is on Patreon!

The vast empire of Russia was modernizing under Peter the Great, and the relatively tiny state of Prussia was evolving as well.

In Prussia, efficiency of institutions became a thing, and Prussia turned into \"a large army with a small state attached.\" \n\nCrash Course is on Patreon!

The vast empire of Russia was modernizing under Peter the Great, and the relatively tiny state of Prussia was evolving as well.

In this episode we\u2019ll explore the world biomaterials like titanium and their coatings, the special chemistry of polyurethane, and the cross-linked structure of hydrogels. We\u2019ll also look at the importance of safety & research, as well as the enormous future potential of biomaterials.\n\nCrash Course Engineering is produced in association with PBS Digital Studios: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL1mtdjDVOoOqJzeaJAV15Tq0tZ1vKj7ZV\n\n***\n\nRESOURCES:\nhttps://www.nibib.nih.gov/science-education/science-topics/biomaterials\nhttps://mse.osu.edu/research/biomaterials\nhttps://www.nature.com/subjects/biomaterials\nhttp://www.medibrane.com/bio-absorbable-implants/\nhttp://pubs.acs.org/cen/coverstory/7906/7906sci2.html\nhttps://www.spine-health.com/glossary/biocompatibility\nhttps://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2090123213000969\nhttp://www.jbiomeds.com/biomedical-sciences/history-and-applications-of-hydrogels.php?aid=7218\nhttps://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10973-016-5329-6\nhttp://fortune.com/2012/09/18/bad-to-the-bone-a-medical-horror-story/\nhttps://ame.nd.edu/research/faculty-research-labs/rroeder/classes/ame-50571/fortunesynthes.pdf\nhttp://cornellsun.com/2010/09/21/the-scientist-david-putnam/\nhttps://www.azom.com/article.aspx?ArticleID=1520\nhttps://www.omicsonline.org/scholarly/bio-inert-materials-journals-articles-ppts-list.php\nhttps://smartech.gatech.edu/handle/1853/42056\nhttps://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-0-306-48584-8_7\nhttps://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0945053X14000511\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20623672\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26894870\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4139820/\nhttp://file.scirp.org/Html/2-1430795_51883.htm\n\n***\n\nCrash Course is on Patreon!

P-hacking is when data is analyzed to find patterns that produce statistically significant results, even if there really isn't an underlying effect, and it has become a huge problem in science since many scientific theories rely on p-values as proof of their existence! Today, we're going to talk about a few ways researchers have \"hacked\" their data, and give you some tips for identifying and avoiding these types of problems when you encounter stats in your own lives. \n\nXKCD's comic on p-hacking: https://xkcd.com/882/ \n\nCrash Course is on Patreon!

                    "description": "Today we're going to talk about p-hacking (also called data dredging or data fishing). P-hacking is when data is analyzed to find patterns that produce statistically significant results, even if there really isn't an underlying effect, and it has become a huge problem in science since many scientific theories rely on p-values as proof of their existence! Today, we're going to talk about a few ways researchers have \"hacked\" their data, and give you some tips for identifying and avoiding these types of problems when you encounter stats in your own lives. \n\nXKCD's comic on p-hacking: https://xkcd.com/882/ \n\nCrash Course is on Patreon!

The normal distribution is incredibly important in statistics because distributions of means are normally distributed even if populations aren't.

The normal distribution is incredibly important in statistics because distributions of means are normally distributed even if populations aren't. We'll get into why this is so - due to the Central Limit Theorem - but it's useful because it allows us to make comparisons between different groups even if we don't know the underlying distribution of the population being studied.  \n\nCrash Course is on Patreon!

Today, we\u2019re going to talk about how we can extract information from seemingly random events starting with the expected value or mean of a distribution and walking through the first four \u201cmoments\u201d  - the mean, variance, skewness, and kurtosis.\n\nNote: There are many formulas to calculate skewness and kurtosis (https://www.itl.nist.gov/div898/handbook/eda/section3/eda35b.htm), our formulas deal with what they have in common, their moment generating functions.\n\nMore on sheep study:  http://aiweirdness.com/post/171451900302/do-neural-nets-dream-of-electric-sheep \n\nMore on fecal matter study: http://aem.asm.org/content/early/2018/02/05/AEM.00044-18.abstract \n\nCrash Course is on Patreon!

                "description": "Russia went and had a revolution in 1917 and cinema was a big part of its aftermath. Even though film stock was hard to come by, we saw the first film school started, and the study of film became hugely important. Russian filmmakers started trying to understand the power of the cut itself, thus developing a theory of filmmaking based solely around the juxtaposition of images: Soviet Montage. In this episode of Crash Course Film History, Craig talks us through some of the filmic things going on in post-revolution era Russia. \n\nProduced in collaboration with PBS Digital Studios: http://youtube.com/pbsdigitalstudios\n\nWant to know more about Craig?\nhttps://www.youtube.com/user/wheezywaiter\n\nThe Latest from PBS Digital Studios: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL1mtdjDVOoOqJzeaJAV15Tq0tZ1vKj7ZV\n\n***\nMovies Discussed in this episode:\nBattleship Potempkin: 1925 - Dir.

                    "description": "Russia went and had a revolution in 1917 and cinema was a big part of its aftermath. Even though film stock was hard to come by, we saw the first film school started, and the study of film became hugely important. Russian filmmakers started trying to understand the power of the cut itself, thus developing a theory of filmmaking based solely around the juxtaposition of images: Soviet Montage. In this episode of Crash Course Film History, Craig talks us through some of the filmic things going on in post-revolution era Russia. \n\nProduced in collaboration with PBS Digital Studios: http://youtube.com/pbsdigitalstudios\n\nWant to know more about Craig?\nhttps://www.youtube.com/user/wheezywaiter\n\nThe Latest from PBS Digital Studios: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL1mtdjDVOoOqJzeaJAV15Tq0tZ1vKj7ZV\n\n***\nMovies Discussed in this episode:\nBattleship Potempkin: 1925 - Dir.

Whether you just like to listen or you enjoy playing an instrument, music is powerful. So what is music? How does it work? What are the physics of music? In this episode of Crash Course Physics, Shini talks to us about how music functions in terms of waves and how these waves interact with our ears. \n\n--\n\nProduced in collaboration with PBS Digital Studios: http://youtube.com/pbsdigitalstudios\n\n--\n\nWant to find Crash Course elsewhere on the internet?\nFacebook - http://www.facebook.com/YouTubeCrashC...\nTwitter - http://www.twitter.com/TheCrashCourse\nTumblr - http://thecrashcourse.tumblr.com \nSupport CrashCourse on Patreon: http://www.patreon.com/crashcourse\n\nCC Kids: http://www.youtube.com/crashcoursekids"

Philosophers have tried to assess what constitutes personhood with a variety of different criteria, including genetic, cognitive, social, sentience, and the gradient theory. As with many of philosophy\u2019s great questions, this has much broader implications than simple conjecture. The way we answer this question informs all sorts of things about the way we move about the world, including our views on some of our greatest social debates.\n\n--\n\nAll other images via Wikimedia Commons, licensed under Creative Commons BY 4.0: https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/\n\n--\n\nProduced in collaboration with PBS Digital Studios: http://youtube.com/pbsdigitalstudios\n\nCrash Course Philosophy is sponsored by Squarespace.\nhttp://www.squarespace.com/crashcourse\n\n--\n\nWant to find Crash Course elsewhere on the internet?\nFacebook - http://www.facebook.com/YouTubeCrashC...\nTwitter - http://www.twitter.com/TheCrashCourse\nTumblr - http://thecrashcourse.tumblr.com \nSupport CrashCourse on Patreon: http://www.patreon.com/crashcourse\n\nCC Kids: http://www.youtube.com/crashcoursekids",

                    "description": "Now that we\u2019ve started talking about identity, today Hank tackles the question of personhood. Philosophers have tried to assess what constitutes personhood with a variety of different criteria, including genetic, cognitive, social, sentience, and the gradient theory. As with many of philosophy\u2019s great questions, this has much broader implications than simple conjecture. The way we answer this question informs all sorts of things about the way we move about the world, including our views on some of our greatest social debates.\n\n--\n\nAll other images via Wikimedia Commons, licensed under Creative Commons BY 4.0: https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/\n\n--\n\nProduced in collaboration with PBS Digital Studios: http://youtube.com/pbsdigitalstudios\n\nCrash Course Philosophy is sponsored by Squarespace.\nhttp://www.squarespace.com/crashcourse\n\n--\n\nWant to find Crash Course elsewhere on the internet?\nFacebook - http://www.facebook.com/YouTubeCrashC...\nTwitter - http://www.twitter.com/TheCrashCourse\nTumblr - http://thecrashcourse.tumblr.com \nSupport CrashCourse on Patreon: http://www.patreon.com/crashcourse\n\nCC Kids: http://www.youtube.com/crashcoursekids"

                "description": "Today, we\u2019re moving on from game consoles to talk about a bigger shift that was happening in the gaming industry. In the mid 2000s, we saw a proliferation of Internet accessible devices and with them gaming would expand to a new audience. We\u2019re going to talk about two types of games that are found on these devices, social and mobile games, which together we\u2019ll call casual games. Now, the definitions of these terms can get a little muddy, as they\u2019re continuously evolving, but largely what was seen in the industry was a widespread adoption of asynchronous, socially driven gameplay. These changes spurred the industry to change its profit model, and by 2015, these casual games now make up nearly half of all video game industry revenue. And with their easier mechanics, lower price point, and social component these casual games helped integrate gaming into our daily lives like never before. \n\nAdditional Imagery Courtesy the following Flickr users:\nAndr\u00e9s Monroy-Hern\u00e1ndez (Zynga Image)\nRob Deutscher (Waiting on Vespa)\nEwen Roberts (Plants V Zombies)\nMorgan (QA Testing Battle Rapper)\nJohan Larsson (Doodle Jump)\nOfficial GDC (Independent Games Summit)\n\nWant some Crash Course Games merch?

                    "description": "Today, we\u2019re moving on from game consoles to talk about a bigger shift that was happening in the gaming industry. In the mid 2000s, we saw a proliferation of Internet accessible devices and with them gaming would expand to a new audience. We\u2019re going to talk about two types of games that are found on these devices, social and mobile games, which together we\u2019ll call casual games. Now, the definitions of these terms can get a little muddy, as they\u2019re continuously evolving, but largely what was seen in the industry was a widespread adoption of asynchronous, socially driven gameplay. These changes spurred the industry to change its profit model, and by 2015, these casual games now make up nearly half of all video game industry revenue. And with their easier mechanics, lower price point, and social component these casual games helped integrate gaming into our daily lives like never before. \n\nAdditional Imagery Courtesy the following Flickr users:\nAndr\u00e9s Monroy-Hern\u00e1ndez (Zynga Image)\nRob Deutscher (Waiting on Vespa)\nEwen Roberts (Plants V Zombies)\nMorgan (QA Testing Battle Rapper)\nJohan Larsson (Doodle Jump)\nOfficial GDC (Independent Games Summit)\n\nWant some Crash Course Games merch?

The early 2000s saw a lot of innovation in hardware and games and we\u2019ll cover some of that, but one significant change that would heavily influence the industry was actually pioneered by that doomed Sega Dreamcast was Internet connectivity. Sony\u2019s Playstation 2, released in 2000, and Nintendo\u2019s GameCube, released in 2001, would also include ways to get online, but Xbox\u2019s implementation of a fully unified network that allowed gamers to compete across consoles was the first of its kind. Now, PCs gamers had been playing across networks, particularly within the popular MMORPG genre, since the mid 90s and we\u2019ll spend a couple episodes taking a closer look at the PC's influence, but today we\u2019re going to focus specifically on how the Internet on consoles helped lead to the prevalence of the competitive gaming and online gaming communities we see today. \n\nWant some Crash Course Games merch?

                    "description": "Today, we wrap up our discussion of the console wars by taking a look at Microsoft\u2019s Xbox which was announced in 2001. The early 2000s saw a lot of innovation in hardware and games and we\u2019ll cover some of that, but one significant change that would heavily influence the industry was actually pioneered by that doomed Sega Dreamcast was Internet connectivity. Sony\u2019s Playstation 2, released in 2000, and Nintendo\u2019s GameCube, released in 2001, would also include ways to get online, but Xbox\u2019s implementation of a fully unified network that allowed gamers to compete across consoles was the first of its kind. Now, PCs gamers had been playing across networks, particularly within the popular MMORPG genre, since the mid 90s and we\u2019ll spend a couple episodes taking a closer look at the PC's influence, but today we\u2019re going to focus specifically on how the Internet on consoles helped lead to the prevalence of the competitive gaming and online gaming communities we see today. \n\nWant some Crash Course Games merch?

                "description": "So the 1980s was the golden age of arcade games. Games like Donkey Kong, Pac- Man, Space Invaders, and Centipede had become a cultural phenomenon. These games had expanded the gamer demographic and even encouraged the rise of competitive gaming. There were also many innovations in the home console and computer market with deeper and longer games like Pitfall and Castle Wolfenstein. Suddenly, you could play a game for much longer than your single quarter could get you on an arcade machine.  So the video game industry was booming, but it had also become a sort of Wild West and everyone from Purina to Quaker wanted to get into the action. With these new creators came a glut of choices, and to remain competitive Atari began rushing games to market resulting in some truly terrible games. Gamers started to lose confidence in the industry and then in 1983 the gaming industry in the United States crashed.\n\nCrash Course is on Patreon!

                    "description": "So the 1980s was the golden age of arcade games. Games like Donkey Kong, Pac- Man, Space Invaders, and Centipede had become a cultural phenomenon. These games had expanded the gamer demographic and even encouraged the rise of competitive gaming. There were also many innovations in the home console and computer market with deeper and longer games like Pitfall and Castle Wolfenstein. Suddenly, you could play a game for much longer than your single quarter could get you on an arcade machine.  So the video game industry was booming, but it had also become a sort of Wild West and everyone from Purina to Quaker wanted to get into the action. With these new creators came a glut of choices, and to remain competitive Atari began rushing games to market resulting in some truly terrible games. Gamers started to lose confidence in the industry and then in 1983 the gaming industry in the United States crashed.\n\nCrash Course is on Patreon!

As you've probably noticed in your real life, in case after case, people don't actually make rational decisions. There can be emotional or social reasons for all this irrationality, and behavioral economics tries to address this. We'll talk about risk, nudge theory, prices and perception, and the ultimatum game. So, let's get irrational, in a logical way, of course.\n\nCrash Course is on Patreon!

As you've probably noticed in your real life, in case after case, people don't actually make rational decisions. There can be emotional or social reasons for all this irrationality, and behavioral economics tries to address this. We'll talk about risk, nudge theory, prices and perception, and the ultimatum game. So, let's get irrational, in a logical way, of course.\n\nCrash Course is on Patreon!

Adriene and Jacob explain why. Subsidies, however, are a little different, and sometimes they even work. We'll also explain that.

Adriene and Jacob explain why. Subsidies, however, are a little different, and sometimes they even work. We'll also explain that. Today you'll learn about stuff like price controls, deadweight loss, subsidies, and efficiency.\n\nCrash Course is on Patreon!

The immune system\u2019s responses begin with physical barriers like skin and mucous membranes, and when they\u2019re not enough, there are phagocytes -- the neutrophils and macrophages. It also features the awesomely named natural killer cells and the inflammatory response, and we'll explain how all of these elements work together to save the day if you happen to slip on a banana peel.\n\nPssst... we made flashcards to help you review the content in this episode!

Today Phil takes you through some Cold War history and then dives into what we know. Bursts come in two rough varieties: Long and short. Long ones are from hypernovae, massive stars exploding, sending out twin beams of matter and energy. Short ones are from merging neutron stars. Both kinds are so energetic they are visible for billions of light years, and both are also the birth announcements of black holes.\n\nCheck out the Crash Course Astronomy solar system poster here: http://store.dftba.com/products/crashcourse-astronomy-poster\n\n--\nChapters:\nIntroduction 00:00 \nGamma Ray Bursts and the Cold War 00:45\nWhere Do Gamma Ray Bursts Come From? 3:26\nWhat Causes Gamma Ray Bursts? 6:11\nKinds of Gamma Ray Bursts: Long and Short 8:35\nWhat Would Happen if a Gamma Ray Burst Hit Earth? 10:24\nReview 12:53\n--\n\nPBS Digital Studios: http://youtube.com/pbsdigitalstudios\n\nFollow Phil on Twitter: https://twitter.com/badastronomer\n\nWant to find Crash Course elsewhere on the internet?\nFacebook - http://www.facebook.com/YouTubeCrashCourse\nTwitter - http://www.twitter.com/TheCrashCourse\nTumblr - http://thecrashcourse.tumblr.com \nSupport CrashCourse on Patreon: http://www.patreon.com/crashcourse\n\n--\n\nPHOTOS/VIDEOS\nNuclear Bomb Images via Wikimedia Commons:\nOperation Upshot Knothole https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Operation_Upshot-Knothole_-_Badger_001.jpg \nIvy Mike https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:IvyMike2.jpg\nCastle Bravo https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Castle_Bravo#/media/File:Castle_Bravo_Blast.jpg\nUpshot Knothole GRABLE https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Upshot-Knothole_GRABLE.jpg\nPresident Kennedy signs the Limited Nuclear Test Ban Treaty https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Partial_Nuclear_Test_Ban_Treaty#/media/File:President_Kennedy_signs_Nuclear_Test_Ban_Treaty,_07_October_1963.jpg [credit: Wikimedia Commons]\nVela http://www.losangeles.af.mil/shared/media/photodb/photos/2013/06/130605-F-IN001-011.jpg [credit: USAF]\nThe Crab Nebula https://www.nasa.gov/multimedia/imagegallery/image_feature_1604.html [credit: NASA, ESA, J.

Today Phil takes you through some Cold War history and then dives into what we know. Bursts come in two rough varieties: Long and short. Long ones are from hypernovae, massive stars exploding, sending out twin beams of matter and energy. Short ones are from merging neutron stars. Both kinds are so energetic they are visible for billions of light years, and both are also the birth announcements of black holes.\n\nCheck out the Crash Course Astronomy solar system poster here: http://store.dftba.com/products/crashcourse-astronomy-poster\n\n--\nChapters:\nIntroduction 00:00 \nGamma Ray Bursts and the Cold War 00:45\nWhere Do Gamma Ray Bursts Come From? 3:26\nWhat Causes Gamma Ray Bursts? 6:11\nKinds of Gamma Ray Bursts: Long and Short 8:35\nWhat Would Happen if a Gamma Ray Burst Hit Earth? 10:24\nReview 12:53\n--\n\nPBS Digital Studios: http://youtube.com/pbsdigitalstudios\n\nFollow Phil on Twitter: https://twitter.com/badastronomer\n\nWant to find Crash Course elsewhere on the internet?\nFacebook - http://www.facebook.com/YouTubeCrashCourse\nTwitter - http://www.twitter.com/TheCrashCourse\nTumblr - http://thecrashcourse.tumblr.com \nSupport CrashCourse on Patreon: http://www.patreon.com/crashcourse\n\n--\n\nPHOTOS/VIDEOS\nNuclear Bomb Images via Wikimedia Commons:\nOperation Upshot Knothole https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Operation_Upshot-Knothole_-_Badger_001.jpg \nIvy Mike https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:IvyMike2.jpg\nCastle Bravo https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Castle_Bravo#/media/File:Castle_Bravo_Blast.jpg\nUpshot Knothole GRABLE https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Upshot-Knothole_GRABLE.jpg\nPresident Kennedy signs the Limited Nuclear Test Ban Treaty https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Partial_Nuclear_Test_Ban_Treaty#/media/File:President_Kennedy_signs_Nuclear_Test_Ban_Treaty,_07_October_1963.jpg [credit: Wikimedia Commons]\nVela http://www.losangeles.af.mil/shared/media/photodb/photos/2013/06/130605-F-IN001-011.jpg [credit: USAF]\nThe Crab Nebula https://www.nasa.gov/multimedia/imagegallery/image_feature_1604.html [credit: NASA, ESA, J.

Clusters of galaxies also clump together to form superclusters, the largest structures in the Universe.

Galaxies tend not to be loners but instead exist in smaller groups and larger clusters. Our Milky Way is part of the Local Group, and will one day collide with the Andromeda galaxy. Clusters of galaxies also clump together to form superclusters, the largest structures in the Universe.

So as you may have noticed, there are kind of a lot of people in the U.S, and holding individual issues up to a public vote doesn't seem particularly plausible. So to deal with this complexity, we vote for people, not policies, that represent our best interests. But as you'll see, this process was not thoroughly addressed in the Constitution, so there have been a number of amendments and laws at the state level implemented to create the election system we all know and (maybe) love today. \n\nProduced in collaboration with PBS Digital Studios: http://youtube.com/pbsdigitalstudios\n\nSupport is provided by Voqal: http://www.voqal.org\n\nAll attributed images are licensed under Creative Commons by Attribution 4.0\nhttps://creativecommons.org/licenses/...\n\nWant to find Crash Course elsewhere on the internet?\nFacebook - http://www.facebook.com/YouTubeCrashC...\nTwitter - http://www.twitter.com/TheCrashCourse\nTumblr - http://thecrashcourse.tumblr.com \nSupport Crash Course on Patreon: http://patreon.com/crashcourse\nCC Kids: http://www.youtube.com/crashcoursekids",

So as you may have noticed, there are kind of a lot of people in the U.S, and holding individual issues up to a public vote doesn't seem particularly plausible. So to deal with this complexity, we vote for people, not policies, that represent our best interests. But as you'll see, this process was not thoroughly addressed in the Constitution, so there have been a number of amendments and laws at the state level implemented to create the election system we all know and (maybe) love today. \n\nProduced in collaboration with PBS Digital Studios: http://youtube.com/pbsdigitalstudios\n\nSupport is provided by Voqal: http://www.voqal.org\n\nAll attributed images are licensed under Creative Commons by Attribution 4.0\nhttps://creativecommons.org/licenses/...\n\nWant to find Crash Course elsewhere on the internet?\nFacebook - http://www.facebook.com/YouTubeCrashC...\nTwitter - http://www.twitter.com/TheCrashCourse\nTumblr - http://thecrashcourse.tumblr.com \nSupport Crash Course on Patreon: http://patreon.com/crashcourse\nCC Kids: http://www.youtube.com/crashcoursekids"

Now this stuff may seem like common sense, but it\u2019s important to know where our opinions come from, especially when you consider how quickly the media landscape is changing.\n\nProduced in collaboration with PBS Digital Studios: http://youtube.com/pbsdigitalstudios\n\nSupport is provided by Voqal: http://www.voqal.org\n\nAll attributed images are licensed under Creative Commons by Attribution 4.0\n\nhttps://creativecommons.org/licenses/...\nWant to find Crash Course elsewhere on the internet?\nFacebook - http://www.facebook.com/YouTubeCrashC...\nTwitter - http://www.twitter.com/TheCrashCourse\nTumblr - http://thecrashcourse.tumblr.com \nSupport Crash Course on Patreon: http://patreon.com/crashcourse\n\nCC Kids: http://www.youtube.com/crashcoursekids"

                "description": "This week on Crash Course Economics, we're talking about monetary policy. The reality of the world is that the United States (and most of the world's economies) are, to varying degrees, Keynesian. When things go wrong, economically, the central bank of the country intervenes to try aand get things back on track. In the United States, the Federal Reserve is the organization that steps in to use monetary policy to steer the economy. When the Fed, as it's called, does step in, there are a few different tacks it can take. The Fed can change interest rates, or it can change the money supply.

Like taxes and monetary policy and inflation and policy. We need this stuff, because if you don't have a big picture of the economy, crashes and panics are more likely.

We'll look at some of the broadest economic choices when we talk about the difference between planned economies and market economies. We'll get into communism, socialism, command economies, and capitalism. We'll look at how countries choose the kind of system they're going to use (spoiler alert: many end up with mixed economies).

We'll look at some of the broadest economic choices when we talk about the difference between planned economies and market economies. We'll get into communism, socialism, command economies, and capitalism. We'll look at how countries choose the kind of system they're going to use (spoiler alert: many end up with mixed economies). We'll also look into how individuals make economic choices.\n\nCrash Course is now on Patreon!

Once the Earth/Sun distance was found, parallax was used to find the distance to nearby stars, and that was bootstrapped using brightness to determine the distances to much farther stars.\n\nCheck out the Crash Course Astronomy solar system poster here: http://store.dftba.com/products/crashcourse-astronomy-poster\n\n--\nChapters:\nIntroduction 00:00\nHow did we calculate the Earth's Size? 1:07\nTHE Astronomical Unit (AU) = 149,597,870.7 km 3:12\nDepth Perception & Parallax 5:39\nLight Years & Parsecs 7:31\nBrightness Indicates Distance 9:07\nReview 10:30\n--\n\nPBS Digital Studios: http://youtube.com/pbsdigitalstudios\n\nFollow Phil on Twitter: https://twitter.com/badastronomer\n\nWant to find Crash Course elsewhere on the internet?\nFacebook - http://www.facebook.com/YouTubeCrashCourse\nTwitter - http://www.twitter.com/TheCrashCourse\nTumblr - http://thecrashcourse.tumblr.com \nSupport CrashCourse on Patreon: http://www.patreon.com/crashcourse\n\n--\n\nPHOTOS/VIDEOS\nLunar Ecplise http://www.slate.com/content/dam/slate/blogs/bad_astronomy/2014/04/15/lunareclipse_partial_apr142014_spica.jpg.CROP.original-original.jpg [credit: Phil Plait]\nVenus & Mercury [credit: Phil Plait]\nVenus Transit https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34mXua1n_FQ [credit: NASA]\nBlack Drop Venus Transit https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_drop_effect#mediaviewer/File:BlackDrop-Venus-Transit.jpg [credit: Wikimedia Commons, H.

It happens at both the state and federal court levels, but today we're going to focus primarily on the court at the top - the Supreme Court of the United States.

Hank and Claire also demonstrate the role size plays in motor units, the three-phase cycle of muscle twitches, and how the strength and frequency of an impulse affect the strength and duration of a contraction. This episode also explains twitch summation, tetanus, and isotonic vs. isometric movements.\n\nPssst... we made flashcards to help you review the content in this episode!

So, patents have some similarities to copyright, in that they grant a limited monopoly to people who invent things. The key difference between patents and copyright is that patents are for THINGS. Copyright is for an idea. So, if you've come up with a great new invention, like for example, a condiment gun, you should get a patent. We'll also talk about some of the limitations and problems of patents, including patent trolls\n\nThanks to the following Patrons for their generous monthly contributions that help keep Crash Course free for everyone forever:\n\nMark Brouwer, Jan Schmid, Steve Marshall, Anna-Ester Volozh, Sandra Aft, Brad Wardell, Christian Ludvigsen, Robert Kunz, Jason, A Saslow, Jacob Ash, Jeffrey Thompson, Jessica Simmons, James Craver, Simun Niclasen, SR Foxley, Roger C.

So, patents have some similarities to copyright, in that they grant a limited monopoly to people who invent things. The key difference between patents and copyright is that patents are for THINGS. Copyright is for an idea. So, if you've come up with a great new invention, like for example, a condiment gun, you should get a patent. We'll also talk about some of the limitations and problems of patents, including patent trolls\n\nThanks to the following Patrons for their generous monthly contributions that help keep Crash Course free for everyone forever:\n\nMark Brouwer, Jan Schmid, Steve Marshall, Anna-Ester Volozh, Sandra Aft, Brad Wardell, Christian Ludvigsen, Robert Kunz, Jason, A Saslow, Jacob Ash, Jeffrey Thompson, Jessica Simmons, James Craver, Simun Niclasen, SR Foxley, Roger C.

Well, the President has a lot of stuff to do as the chief executive, and as much as Americans like to talk about personal responsibility, the President can't really do all this stuff alone. Because it's a huge job! Same deal with Congress. So, they delegate authority. This is where all the government agencies and stuff come from. Congress creates them to actually get around to enforcing laws. You'll learn about stuff like OSHA, the FDA, and maybe even the FCC. Although you hear an occasional complaint about bureaucracies and such, the business of government wouldn't get done without agencies and delegation.\n\nSupport is provided by Voqal: http://www.voqal.org\nThis episode is sponsored by Squarespace: http://www.squarespace.com/crashcourse \n\nChapters:\nIntroduction: Delegation 00:00\nWhat is delegation? 0:39\nHow Congress limits an agency's discretion 1:37\nWhy Congress delegates power 2:45\nCongressionally delegated powers: key takeaways  4:37\nCredits 5:44\n\nCrash Course is on Patreon!

                    "description": "In which Craig Benzine teaches you about delegation and informal powers. What are all these federal agencies about? Well, the President has a lot of stuff to do as the chief executive, and as much as Americans like to talk about personal responsibility, the President can't really do all this stuff alone. Because it's a huge job! Same deal with Congress. So, they delegate authority. This is where all the government agencies and stuff come from. Congress creates them to actually get around to enforcing laws. You'll learn about stuff like OSHA, the FDA, and maybe even the FCC. Although you hear an occasional complaint about bureaucracies and such, the business of government wouldn't get done without agencies and delegation.\n\nSupport is provided by Voqal: http://www.voqal.org\nThis episode is sponsored by Squarespace: http://www.squarespace.com/crashcourse \n\nChapters:\nIntroduction: Delegation 00:00\nWhat is delegation? 0:39\nHow Congress limits an agency's discretion 1:37\nWhy Congress delegates power 2:45\nCongressionally delegated powers: key takeaways  4:37\nCredits 5:44\n\nCrash Course is on Patreon!

We\u2019ll talk about the three motivating factors of congressional decisions - constituency, interest groups, and political parties - and we\u2019ll break down how each of these factors motivates certain actions like casework, public opinion polls, and logrolling. Craig will even weigh in on which of these factors probably contributes most significantly to the actions and decisions of our congresspersons and he'll do it without even a touch of cynicism!\n\nSupport is provided by Voqal: http://www.voqal.org\nThis episode is sponsored by Squarespace: http://www.squarespace.com/crashcourse \n \nChapters:\nIntroduction 00:00\nHow constituents & public opinion influence lawmakers 0:38\nHow interest groups influence lawmakers 2:01\nHow political parties influence lawmakers 3:07\nPresidential power & political parties 4:20\nOther influences on congressional decisions 5:20\nCredits 6:05\n\nCrash Course is on Patreon!

In theory, the Legislative Branch, the Executive Branch, and the Judicial Brach are designed to keep each other in check and to keep any branch from becoming too powerful.

Craig will call in the clones to explain which powers belong to which branches and to reveal some secret perks that the Supreme Court justices enjoy.\n\nProduced in collaboration with PBS Digital Studios: http://youtube.com/pbsdigitalstudios\nSupport is provided by Voqal: http://www.voqal.org\n\nChapters:\nIntroduction 00:00\nSeparation of Powers 0:25\nChecks & Balances 2:28\nLegislative Branch powers over the Executive Branch 2:58\nLegislative Branch powers over the Judiciary Branch 3:39\nExecutive Branch powers over the Legislative Branch 4:37\nExecutive Branch powers over the Judiciary Branch 4:59\nJudiciary Branch powers over the Legislative & Executive Branches 5:20\nWhy do we have checks & balances? 6:22\nCredits 7:58\n\nCrash Course is on Patreon!

In theory, the Legislative Branch, the Executive Branch, and the Judicial Brach are designed to keep each other in check and to keep any branch from becoming too powerful. In reality, the system was designed to keep the President from becoming some kind of autocrat. For the most part, it has worked. Craig will call in the clones to explain which powers belong to which branches and to reveal some secret perks that the Supreme Court justices enjoy.\n\nProduced in collaboration with PBS Digital Studios: http://youtube.com/pbsdigitalstudios\nSupport is provided by Voqal: http://www.voqal.org\n\nChapters:\nIntroduction 00:00\nSeparation of Powers 0:25\nChecks & Balances 2:28\nLegislative Branch powers over the Executive Branch 2:58\nLegislative Branch powers over the Judiciary Branch 3:39\nExecutive Branch powers over the Legislative Branch 4:37\nExecutive Branch powers over the Judiciary Branch 4:59\nJudiciary Branch powers over the Legislative & Executive Branches 5:20\nWhy do we have checks & balances? 6:22\nCredits 7:58\n\nCrash Course is on Patreon!

We're going to start with the Big Bang, take you right through all of history (recorded and otherwise), and even talk a little bit about the future. It is going to be awesome. In the awe-inspiring sense of the word awesome. In this episode, we walk you through the start of everything: The Big Bang. We'll look at how the universe unfolded at its very beginning, and how everything in the universe that we know today came into being. So that's kind of a big deal, right?\n\nFor more information, visit www.bighistoryproject.com\n\nCrash Course is on Patreon!

                "description": "In which John Green teaches you about the Little Ice Age. The Little Ice Age was a period of global cooling that occurred from the 13th to the 19th centuries. This cooling was likely caused by a number of factors, including unusual solar activity and volcanic eruptions. The Little Ice Age greatly impacted human social orders, especially during the 17th century. When the climate changed, and the weather became unpredictable, the world changed profoundly. Poor harvests led to hunger, which led to even less productivity, which even resulted in violent upheaval in a lot of places. All this from a little change in the temperature?

                    "description": "In which John Green teaches you about the Little Ice Age. The Little Ice Age was a period of global cooling that occurred from the 13th to the 19th centuries. This cooling was likely caused by a number of factors, including unusual solar activity and volcanic eruptions. The Little Ice Age greatly impacted human social orders, especially during the 17th century. When the climate changed, and the weather became unpredictable, the world changed profoundly. Poor harvests led to hunger, which led to even less productivity, which even resulted in violent upheaval in a lot of places. All this from a little change in the temperature? Definitely.\n\nReference: \nGlobal Crisis by Geoffrey Parker: https://bit.ly/3M99AvQ\n\nCrash Course is on Patreon!

When we think of the western expansion of the United States in the 19th century, we're conditioned to imagine the loner. The self-reliant, unattached cowpoke roaming the prairie in search of wandering calves, or the half-addled prospector who has broken from reality thanks to the solitude of his single-minded quest for gold dust. While there may be a grain of truth to these classic Hollywood stereotypes, it isn't a very big grain of truth. Many of the pioneers who settled the west were family groups. Many were immigrants. Many were major corporations. The big losers in the westward migration were Native Americans, who were killed or moved onto reservations. Not cool, American pioneers. \n\nHey teachers and students - Check out CommonLit's free collection of reading passages and curriculum resources to learn more about the events of this episode.

                "description": "Atoms are a lot like us - we call their relationships \"bonds,\" and there are many different types. Each kind of atomic relationship requires a different type of energy, but they all do best when they settle into the lowest stress situation possible. The nature of the bond between atoms is related to the distance between them and, like people, it also depends on how positive or negative they are. Unlike human relationships, we can analyze exactly what makes chemical relationships work, and that's what this episode is all about. \n\nIf you are paying attention, you will learn that chemical bonds form in order to minimize the energy difference between two atoms or ions; that those chemical bonds may be covalent if atoms share electrons, and that covalent bonds can share those electrons evenly or unevenly; that bonds can also be ionic if the electrons are transferred instead of shared: and how to calculate the energy transferred in an ionic bond using Coulomb's Law. \n\nPssst... we made flashcards to help you review the content in this episode!

                    "description": "Atoms are a lot like us - we call their relationships \"bonds,\" and there are many different types. Each kind of atomic relationship requires a different type of energy, but they all do best when they settle into the lowest stress situation possible. The nature of the bond between atoms is related to the distance between them and, like people, it also depends on how positive or negative they are. Unlike human relationships, we can analyze exactly what makes chemical relationships work, and that's what this episode is all about. \n\nIf you are paying attention, you will learn that chemical bonds form in order to minimize the energy difference between two atoms or ions; that those chemical bonds may be covalent if atoms share electrons, and that covalent bonds can share those electrons evenly or unevenly; that bonds can also be ionic if the electrons are transferred instead of shared: and how to calculate the energy transferred in an ionic bond using Coulomb's Law. \n\nPssst... we made flashcards to help you review the content in this episode!

                "description": "In which John Green ACTUALLY teaches about the Civil War. In part one of our two-part look at the US Civil War, John looks into the causes of the war, and the motivations of the individuals who went to war. The overarching causes and the individual motivations were not always the same, you see. John also looks into why the North won, and whether that outcome was inevitable. The North's industrial and population advantages are examined, as are the problems of the Confederacy, including its need to build a nation at the same time it was fighting a war. As usual, John doesn't get much into the actual battle-by-battle breakdown. He does talk a little about the overarching strategy that won the war, and Grant's plan to just overwhelm the South with numbers. Grant took a lot of losses in the latter days of the war, but in the end, it did lead to the surrender of the South. \n\nIf you want to learn more about the Civil War, we recommend these books:\nBattle Cry of Freedom by James McPherson: https://bit.ly/3jAtBzo\nThe Civil War by Shelby Foote: https://bit.ly/38VXTKZ\n\nHey teachers and students - Check out CommonLit's free collection of reading passages and curriculum resources to learn more about the events of this episode.

                    "description": "In which John Green ACTUALLY teaches about the Civil War. In part one of our two-part look at the US Civil War, John looks into the causes of the war, and the motivations of the individuals who went to war. The overarching causes and the individual motivations were not always the same, you see. John also looks into why the North won, and whether that outcome was inevitable. The North's industrial and population advantages are examined, as are the problems of the Confederacy, including its need to build a nation at the same time it was fighting a war. As usual, John doesn't get much into the actual battle-by-battle breakdown. He does talk a little about the overarching strategy that won the war, and Grant's plan to just overwhelm the South with numbers. Grant took a lot of losses in the latter days of the war, but in the end, it did lead to the surrender of the South. \n\nIf you want to learn more about the Civil War, we recommend these books:\nBattle Cry of Freedom by James McPherson: https://bit.ly/3jAtBzo\nThe Civil War by Shelby Foote: https://bit.ly/38VXTKZ\n\nHey teachers and students - Check out CommonLit's free collection of reading passages and curriculum resources to learn more about the events of this episode.

During and after the American Revolutionary War, the government of the new country operated under the Articles of Confederation. While these Articles got the young nation through its war with England, they weren't of much use when it came to running a country. So, the founding fathers decided to try their hand at nation-building, and they created the Constitution of the United States, which you may remember as the one that says We The People at the top. John will tell you how the convention came together, some of the compromises that had to be made to pass this thing, and why it's very lucky that the framers installed a somewhat reasonable process for making changes to the thing. You'll learn about Shays' Rebellion, the Federalist Papers, the elite vs rabble dynamic of the houses of congress, and start to find out just what an anti-federalist is.\n\nHey teachers and students - Check out CommonLit's free collection of reading passages and curriculum resources to learn more about the events of this episode.

In any case, John will teach you about the major battles of the war, and discuss the strategies on both sides. Everyone is familiar with how this war played out for the Founding Fathers; they got to become the Founding Fathers. But what did the revolution mean to the common people in the United States? For white, property-owning males, it was pretty sweet. They gained rights that were a definite step up from being British Colonial citizens. For everyone else, the short-term gains were not clear. Women's rights were unaffected, and slaves remained in slavery. As for poor white folks, they remained poor and disenfranchised. The reality is it took a long time for this whole democracy thing to get underway, and the principles of life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness weren't immediately available to all these newly minted Americans.\n\nHey teachers and students - Check out CommonLit's free collection of reading passages and curriculum resources to learn more about the events of this episode.

In any case, John will teach you about the major battles of the war, and discuss the strategies on both sides. Everyone is familiar with how this war played out for the Founding Fathers; they got to become the Founding Fathers. But what did the revolution mean to the common people in the United States? For white, property-owning males, it was pretty sweet. They gained rights that were a definite step up from being British Colonial citizens. For everyone else, the short-term gains were not clear. Women's rights were unaffected, and slaves remained in slavery. As for poor white folks, they remained poor and disenfranchised. The reality is it took a long time for this whole democracy thing to get underway, and the principles of life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness weren't immediately available to all these newly minted Americans.\n\nHey teachers and students - Check out CommonLit's free collection of reading passages and curriculum resources to learn more about the events of this episode.

The Revolutionary War didn't start on July 4 either. (as you remember, I'm sure, the Revolution and the Revolutionary War are not the same thing) The shooting started on April 19, 1775, at Lexington and/or Concord, MA. Or the shooting started with the Boston Massacre on March 5, 1770. At least we can pin down the Declaration of Independence to July 4, 1776. Except that most of the signers didn't sign until August 2. The point is that the beginning of the Revolution is very complex and hard to pin down. John will lead you through the bramble of taxes, royal decrees, acts of parliament, colonial responses, and various congresses. We'll start with the end of the Seven Years' War, and the bill that the British ran up fighting the war. This led to taxes on colonial trade, which led to colonists demanding representation, which led to revolution.

Why were the French and Indians fighting each other? The Seven Years' war was actually a global war that went on for nine years. I think I'm having trouble making this clear.

At the same time, thinkers like John Locke were rethinking the relationship between rulers and the ruled.

Before the English got there though, the colony was full of Dutch people who treated women pretty fairly and allowed free Black people to hold jobs. John also discusses Penn's Woods, also known as Pennsylvania. Pennsylvania was (briefly) a haven of religious freedom, and William Penn dealt relatively fairly with the natives his colony displaced. Of course, as soon as Penn died, the colonist started abusing the natives immediately. We venture as far south as the Carolina colonies, where the slave labor economy was taking shape.

It turns out that in spite of the lofty dream that everyone had an equal shot in the new world, there were elites in the colonies. And these elites tended to be in charge. And then their kids tended to take over when they died. So yeah, not quite an egalitarian paradise.

                "description": "In which John Green teaches you about relations between the early English colonists and the Native people they encountered in the New World. In short, these relations were poor. As soon as they arrived, the English were in conflict with the native people. At Jamestown, Captain John Smith briefly managed to get the colony on pretty solid footing with the local tribes, but it didn't last, and a long series of wars with the natives ensued. This pattern would continue in US history, with settlers pushing into native lands and pushing the inhabitants further west. In this episode, you'll learn about Wahunsunacawh (who the English called Powhatan), his daughter Pocahontas, King Philip's (aka Metacom) War, and the Mystic Massacre. By and large, the history of the Natives and the English was not a happy one, even Thanksgiving wasn't all it's cracked up to be. \n\nHey teachers and students - Check out CommonLit's free collection of reading passages and curriculum resources to learn more about the events of this episode.
