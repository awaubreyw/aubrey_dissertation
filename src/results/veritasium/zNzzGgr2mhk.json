But it wasn&#39;t explained how duration affects the atom in the first place, so I&#39;m having trouble digesting the first claim.<br><br>What happens if the atom is subject to a steady stream of microwaves? Does it constantly absorb and re-emit energy, oscillating between excited and ground states? <br><br>Say for illustration the light pulse duration is 1as (arbitrary seconds) at a wavelength of 1am (arbitrary metres) in order to give the correct amount of energy to transition from spin down (lower energy) to spin up (higher energy). If we supply wavelength 1am light for 0.5as duration, does that put the atom in a 50/50 superposition of down/up? If we do 0.25as duration, does that put it at 25/75? Maybe the exact relationship between duration and phase is some more complicated function, but the core of my understanding here is that superposition states are acting as smooth interpolation states between the end points of fully down and fully up.
