Go next down the comment section if you don&#39;t have much time.<br><br><br><br>I want to share my story with you. (the whole point of the comment is try to unite some people together)<br>At first I want to say that I believe that some people search for information because it maintains their worldview. There is a lot of reasons, but this is just one of them.  Many people know that science changed the world, it changes it right know and it will changing it in the future, and that&#39;s one of the reasons they are interested in science - because it can solve humanities problems. Many of those who have such worldview  face the one big problem - the information is not in the one exact place - it is scattered across the internet. To reach that knowledge you have to work hard, you have to visit a dozens of videos or websites to assemble the puzzle, so that the main picture will be seen clearly. For some topics the dispute is going, so, again, it is difficult to process all the opinions and arguments from both sides of dispute. And sometimes the information is basicly restricted. For example, I once tried to download a book from the internet, but I found that there is no free, or &quot;pirate&quot; version.<br>That&#39;s all above as you may already understand is a big problem for me. I am feel unfulfilled when I lack some essential for me information. Also, I have no much time to do all the things I want to do and at the same  time search for the information and it&#39;s evidence  literally for hours. I was recently pondering about why do popularizators of science just doesn&#39;t unite together and write a comprehensive book or article about, for example Evolution. How it exactly happens, the main misconceptions floating around it, all the evidence of it, the debunking of arguments against evolution, and debunking of counterarguments and so on. Why doesn&#39;t they just make a <b>one, comprehensive source of information</b> , and after that only adding a new &quot;patches&quot; as times goes on and new knowledge pops in. If they do so, everyone, creationist or evolutionist can see the whole picture, without struggling while searching for the information for weeks or even months and years. <br>So, I have also struggled a lot. And what I wanna do is to create a group on the internet to unite people. In this group they can search for evidence-based information all over the internet and then working together to make a comprehensive articles on different topics with all the evidence needed. I really believe that &quot;two heads is better than one&quot; (in my case, a few tens or even hundreds of heads is better than one)<br>United with someone, you can reach a bigger heights. Let&#39;s ponder together how can we make destribution of information better. If you interested, then try to find me in Facebook.
