The atmosphere on Mars is 100x thinner than ours. You need air to generate lift. The Ingenuity drone is 19 inches tall with four foot diameter propellers spinning at 2400 rpm. They had to redesign computers and other electronic parts to keep the robot light enough to take off. <br><br>This is a cool tech demo, but a walking-flying robot is about as practical as a flying car. We&#39;ve built flying cars -- vehicles that can both drive and fly. They&#39;re invariably bad at one or the other (or usually both). There are plenty of companies working to make &quot;flying cars&quot; -- by which they actually mean new designs that work like a helicopter, but better. <br><br>Sigh. This thing is cool, but it isn&#39;t the future. I skimmed through the paper. Nowhere did I find anything about how long LEO could fly. A couple quotes from the paper: <br><br>The nominal walking speed of LEO is 20 cm/s<br><br>We investigated its cost of transportation (CoT), a dimensionless quantity characterizing the energy efficiency of locomotion. For LEO, the measured CoT was 108 when walking at a speed of 20 cm/s. When flying at 1 m/s, the CoT was 48, and it decreased to 15.5 at the flight speed of 3 m/s. <br><br>Tilting the propeller thrust forces inward increases the moment the propellers can produce about the ground contact point, which improves the controllability for balancing and walking motions. However, there is a trade-off to be made, because larger tilt angles also reduce the net vertical thrust and flight efficiency. It is also possible to vary the tilt angles of the propellers with additional actuators while LEO is walking or flying to improve its performance. However, this was not done for LEO, because this feature would add extra weight and complexity. <br><br>LEO with more rigid legs would require less thrust for preventing excessive leg deformation. Furthermore, LEO could walk with the reduced support from the propellers by adopting finite feet for better stability or higher power motors with torque control for joint actuation that would allow for fast and accurate enough foot position tracking to stabilize the walking gait. In such a case, propellers may need to turn on only when the legs fail to maintain stability on the ground without having to run continuously. These solutions would cause a weight increase and lead to a higher energy consumption during flight maneuvers, but they would lower energy consumption during walking. In the case of LEO, we aimed to achieve balanced aerial and ground locomotion capabilities, and we opted for lightweight legs. Achieving efficient walking with lightweight legs similar to LEO\u2019s is still an open challenge in the field of bipedal robots, and it remains to be investigated in future work.<br><br><br>And for a last piece of fun, LEO has a weight of 2.58 kg (5.7 lbs).

In cases such as this, &quot;Intelligent Design&quot; (not the religious argument) is very much the correct approach and everything that IS possible SHOULD be considered as part of the solution. Creating tools and/or extensions of ourselves should not come with a set of rules that needs to be followed but rather need to be overcome.

Drones are something I\u2019ve been playing with since Covid started so it\u2019s great to see some of that same technology used for scientific advancements. I use the same batteries, connectors, props and motors, and the flight controller for balance.  I understand the technical bits in the video, discussing the update time for the flight controller and the control link. It\u2019s interesting they are using 200Hz control link because that is the sweet spot for drones on reaction latency and distance away. The higher Hz, the more data has to be sent and interpreted by the craft. Typically means faster reaction but at the expense of distance away from the transmitter. Lower Hz (around 50) gives more flexibility for longer distances (25+ miles from the radio).
