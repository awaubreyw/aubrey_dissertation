Done for the purpose of getting the clumps of waste and paper down the drain with ample pressure - so to prevent clogging. <br><br>For your own test, take the small waste container in your bathroom, empty it, fill it with water from the tub spicket, and pour it into the toilet bowl quickly.

Sorry but samples of one do not prove anything. If they repeated it a few more times, then it would start to get compelling and might be worthy of a submitting a paper somewhere.

It at least posses variables that must be answered before you call this done or explained. <br><br>At the North Pole the Aurora Borealis is not electricity created by the earths spinning, rather it is a reactionary electricity created to and against the electricity that is drawn into the North Pole by the earths spinning. Much like lightning is the reaction to electricity from the earth, striking the cloud face of a storm cloud that cannot pass that quantity of electricity through the cloud and into the vastness of space. <br><br>If your hypothesis about the pool spinning because one side of the pool is moving faster than the other is correct, then you would have to prove that without interaction of any kind that the pool constantly swirls without draining of any kind. In the direction you predict it will spin. This may be true or not, I do not know. However it would be so if your theory is correct. <br><br>I believe that when the water starts moving, vertically, it creates a magnetic field in order to do so. I believe it is this magnetic field that causes the direction of the swirl, along with the different electrical fields of the earth in the North and South hemisphere. <br><br>The actual magnetic interaction of the North and South hemisphere seems rather a complex situation to explain.

But WRONG. And here&#39;s why:<br><br>1. If the theory is correct, the experiment can be replicated with a different set-up. If heavy molecules like water is affected by a spinning ground, a little stream of water going down a wide, slanted plate would produce a NON-straight path as it goes reaching a lower level! But of course it would only go down in a straight path down.<br><br>2. A more probable explanation is that the drain hole is not perfectly centered. Also, if a perfectly centered hole should be produced, the water would still go around the hole to overcome it&#39;s adhesion with its container. Likewise, pulling a pipe fitted into another pipe is easier if you do so while spinning it. Also, in reverse, an accelerated, light-weight vehicle can &quot;climb&quot; up a nearly vertical wall as it races on perpendicular to the wall, as demonstrated by the &quot;wall of death&quot;.<br><br>Explanation no.2 also explains the mechanism of the Tesla Turbine, which takes advantage of the nature of flowing liquid.<br><br>3. Because the mechanism proposed by the gentlemen in this video would invite an infinite number of contradictions in the real world. One example: If a few feet of length would have induced such difference in the momentum of a heavy liquid, why would a balloon, for a greater length if you&#39;d like, suspended up in a closed room, would not exhibit the same effect?

It&#39;s an easy way to test what &quot;pole&quot; is the dominant in your area, and will also tell you how well things can grow there.  North pole causes clockwise(looking down on) counter-spatial programming in seeds and eggs, which is unhealthy and usually causes death.  South pole is counter-clockwise (looking down on) spatial programming and is the natural healthy way for plants and animals to grow.  There are going to be other variables in closer proximity as material is easy to make behave coherently, whichever polarity tips the scale will cause the direction of rotation.  Physically overriding with an initial flow direction locally is obviously doable, but if you&#39;re talking about from a completely still, it will vortex in the direction in favour of the polarity rotation.<br><br>The same effect is the cause for wind and stormcloud rotation as well as planetary rotation etc.<br><br>This is a fundamental law of nature and is absolutely necessary and unavoidable in logical deconstruction of field physics.", "comment_date": "2016-08-16T04:12:43Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "TunMaker", "comment_text": "good job love the collaboration love the video sync your both awesome thank you", "comment_date": "2016-08-16T00:08:33Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Red Point", "comment_text": "this was amazing", "comment_date": "2016-08-15T20:08:43Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Zach zaffis", "comment_text": "This was fantastic to watch side by side.", "comment_date": "2016-08-15T19:58:23Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "reinux", "comment_text": "Mind flushed.", "comment_date": "2016-08-15T12:29:28Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Jacob Rubio", "comment_text": "that was so amazing! may I compile these videos for this who don&#39;t have two screens to sync the video?", "comment_date": "2016-08-15T07:45:34Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Pixel Schnitzel", "comment_text": "!emosewa yllatot saw tahT", "comment_date": "2016-08-14T16:53:36Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Kunci Inggris", "comment_text": "That makes me wondering how will the water swirl right on the equator, like here in Indonesia?", "comment_date": "2016-08-14T10:33:41Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "TheImbord212", "comment_text": "Comment in the Southern Channel<br><br>(The other comment is on the Northern channel)", "comment_date": "2016-08-13T20:11:16Z", "likes_count": 5}, {"comment_by": "Jordan Johnson", "comment_text": "...to look at both comment sections.", "comment_date": "2016-08-13T19:27:27Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "PumpkinPie", "comment_text": "KIDS IN AFRICA COULD HAVE EATEN THAT POOL", "comment_date": "2016-08-12T19:38:16Z", "likes_count": 5}, {"comment_by": "Cute Cat Sammy Neptune", "comment_text": "Wow this is awesome if you synchronize them", "comment_date": "2016-08-12T06:09:32Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Priscila Par\u00eds", "comment_text": "oh my goodness that was mind blowing specially because you made the videos like that. that made it even more sense. and your theory was so interesting.  that is awesome", "comment_date": "2016-08-11T21:45:21Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "geocarey", "comment_text": "The outflow hole has irregular edges.

It&#39;s FAR to small of a body of water to be effected.  ALSO, and this is probably more important, there isn&#39;t TIME for that small of a body of water to be effected by the Coriolis Effect.  Large planetary systems/bodies of water ARE effected by the Coriolis Effect, small ones are not.  Regarding the kiddie pool it could have been the way/angle the drain was installed or how the hole was poked (if there wasn&#39;t a drain already installed) it could have been any number of factors JUST like there were factors for how the sink drained one way sometimes and the other way other times.  <br><br>I&#39;m actually sort of shocked he posted this video.

Much like the hucksters that trick tourists at the equator (shown in some of the video excepts he showed from the &quot;Long Way Down&quot; video with Ewan McGregor and Charlie Boorman that he showed here) by showing them which way water drains out of a BUCKET on one side of the equator and then has them step over the equator by only a few feet and supposedly it drains the other way.)

Narrow it up and interference or back up effects set it. One of these could be visualised as\u00a0water separating into\u00a0streams pushing each other aside as they crowd in and fall.\u00a0 Which\u00a0aside must be chancy.

So for a completely horizontal pool at the perfect place and time when you pull the plug the water will be at unstable equilibrium an it will randomly rotate clockwise or anticlockwise.. or not?", "comment_date": "2015-06-07T18:00:58Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Roger Snow", "comment_text": "That was an awesome sync!\u00a0 Incredibly creative way to collaborate!", "comment_date": "2015-06-07T17:41:16Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Luk\u00e1\u0161 \u0158\u00e1dek", "comment_text": "By the way... to make sense of this comment, interleave the words with words from my comment on the other video :P<br>SYNC NOW:<br>was the explanation Coriolis I ever across :). if do consider dual :).<br>END OF SYNC :P", "comment_date": "2015-06-07T17:14:34Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Kolleg Essig", "comment_text": "wow, this video got more views ahahahha", "comment_date": "2015-06-07T17:00:13Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Krakk23", "comment_text": "In Norway the water just flows straight down....", "comment_date": "2015-06-07T16:45:48Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Hapsard", "comment_text": "so, question ... if there are effects that make sinks swirl opposite from what they &quot;should&quot; in their respective hemisphere, are there ever instances where circumstances come together to make a hurricane or cyclone turn opposite from the norm?", "comment_date": "2015-06-07T16:37:06Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Mark McCombs", "comment_text": "Brilliant.", "comment_date": "2015-06-07T16:24:53Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "w wyborn", "comment_text": "yeah this was cool , thanks for the fun info and demonstration", "comment_date": "2015-06-07T16:20:45Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Andrea Micheli", "comment_text": "Possibly the best youtube video I have ever seen!

The Coriolis force is obviously going to be a factor in hurricanes as their sizes are so large that there are measurable differences in the relative velocities from north to south. In a kiddy pool... Not so much. The Earth is something like 8-9 orders of magnitude larger. Plus, the way you added the dye was also something that could have imparted angular momentum. AND, you need to use the exact same tub in both the northern and the southern hemispheres. Any slight variation in shape could impart resitance to flow in one direction over another, and preferential rotation will be the result. I think it&#39;s too early to judge here.

I have two questions that are probably pretty stupid. First, when you introduce the die to the water in the kiddie pool does that not add turbulence to the water that could potentially affect which direction the water would swirl? Particularly since the effect is so small, could some small disturbance not overpower the effect and cause the water to swirl in one particular way or another? Secondly I read that the Coriolis effect does not apply to small bodies of water such as sinks and toilet bowls. However it does effect is supposed to apply to large bodies of water which is why hurricanes/typhoons rotate in different directions depending on which hemisphere they are in. But if the effect is so small and so easily overpowered could disturbances in the water not affect which direction the water would swirl?", "comment_date": "2015-06-05T03:39:13Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Taz Olson", "comment_text": "Loved that collaboration, it worked out really well!", "comment_date": "2015-06-05T03:34:07Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Richard L", "comment_text": "The both videos on one page link was very helpful.

Pressure systems are created due to density differences in the atmosphere caused primarily by uneven heating of the earth&#39;s surface. Denser cooler air rushes equatorward from the poles and warm air rushes poleward from the equator. The cyclonic rotation of the earth creates an apparent force called Coriolis force which causes high pressure centers in air masses to rotate clockwise in the Northern Hemisphere and counterclockwise in the Southern Hemisphere. The reverse is true for low pressure centers such as in the pool. The closer to the poles the more the rotation of the earth causes Coriolis effects. Upward and downward vertical motions also are involved in which a veering or backing effect takes place to conserve angular momentum. The Hadley cell&#39;s circulation near the equator is there due to band of low pressure and cyclones which develops due to heating causing warm air to rise. Coriolis force deflects the air to the right as it rises till it sinks back down in the subtropical region diverging anticyclonically on the surface. The interaction between the surface cyclonic flow near the equator and anticyclonic flow in the subtropical region creates the easterly trade winds at the base of the Hadley cell. The moisture along the equatorial regions is water vapor  due to heating of the surface which rises till it condenses. Quite often in June through November with enough warm water and moisture in a cyclonic flow you get typhoons and hurricanes. The moisture and heat creates a buoyant flow. The winds get faster in the cyclone as a result creating more centripetal force and an eye. Land and cool currents or wind shear etc can disrupt the flow and it will fall apart.

Also, the graphic model you made was an extreme case and did not explain the motion that Australia is doing. And lastly, you did ONE experiment. You should do many pools at the same time in multiple locations and have counter data from the northern hemisphere.
