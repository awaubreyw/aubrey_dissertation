Gravity is a push not a pull. The earth (and everything else) is expanding at a universal rate (as with motion there is no absolute size, only relative size). The hand holding the slinky in the tower is moving upward which causes the slinky to stretch. When released the top of the slinky moves away quickly from the observer in the tower because the slinky is contracting AND the observer is continuing upward. The observer on the ground sees the bottom of the slinky as stationary because he (and everything in the background) is moving up at the same rate as the bottom of the slinky is being pulled up by the spring&#39;s recompression. The bottom of the spring is matching gravity not defying it. The spring fully compresses and then the ground comes up and hits it. Congratulations, you just proved what gravity truly is, but without doubt you nor anyone else will accept that clear proof.

When you add gravity to the mix the same thing happens except we now have two forces acting on each end. In the upper ends case both gravity and the restoring force ( remember the string is stretched at this point ) pull the end downwards whereas in the lower ends case the forces are equal but acting in opposite directions, gravity down,restoring up. That&#39;s what happens here.This is primarly not a wave effect as their second experiment suggests but a forces effect. For as long as the two forces acting on the lower end are equal and balanced then it will not move. The upwards restoring force is only dependent on the length of the spring as measured from the centre so until the bottom half of the spring begins to shorten that will remain constant.", "comment_date": "2017-02-13T20:24:57Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Sebastjans Slavitis", "comment_text": "That&#39;s amazing! how it doesn&#39;t become tangled after first fall?", "comment_date": "2017-02-04T16:14:50Z", "likes_count": 2}, {"comment_by": "p-brane", "comment_text": "There is no &quot;gravity&quot;.

But here&#39;s what&#39;s happening.  Normally, a horizontal slinky held stretched in two hands and released, both ends would move toward the center.  But held vertically, and where gravity is the invisible other hand stretching the slinky down, when held from the top, the bottom comes to rest at a point of equilibrium where the spring can&#39;t be stretched more due to gravity, and due to gravity the spring does not pull the bottom up any higher than this balanced length.  Now when you release the top end, remember normally both ends of a spring will usually move toward each other, unless one end is still being held, in this case by gravity.  The top comes down faster than you&#39;d expect from free fall because you have the effect of gravity plus the effect of the spring wanting to compress working at the same time.  The bottom wants to go up, but can&#39;t because it would have to overcome gravity, and every instant of the fall the spring is becoming less stretched, and therefore the spring force is diminishing.  So even though the bottom gets lighter, the stretched portion of the spring gets shorter, and at the exact same time it is becoming easier to rise to meet the top, the spring force is decreasing, never able to lift the bottom at all.  The bottom never falls as long as it is stretched at all, because if it&#39;s stretched at all it is hanging rather than falling.  It&#39;s a matter of balancing forces, spring pulling up, gravity pulling down, a constantly changing--getting lighter--weight (the still stretched portion) and a constantly changing--getting less strong--spring force (the degree of extension between coils).  And these two forces remaining ever changing but always in balance which offset each other in such a way as to give the &quot;hanging&quot; portion of the slinky the appearance of being weightless.  But weightless or at a constant altitude much like an airplane would be considered weightless; balanced forces would be a better explanation than weightless.
