Video is just the flow of several pictures. So, you hear the sound because of the moving objects. But in a photo, it just captured 1/infinite th moment, which is a still position of the object and the objects around it at that particular time. So, the sound won&#39;t come. Only when the motion occurs, sound comes.  So, in a picture, the movement of the molecule are literally in no motion. So, relative to that picture, it is just a piece of image which shows what exactly happened in that 1/infinite th of the time. So, even if the molecules were moving, it atleast takes time. The thing is that, we don&#39;t recognize it. And, an image shows the state of objects in that particular 1/infinite th time, and the molecules are still. So, there can&#39;t be any possible ways to take sound out of a picture. <br>Think like this,<br>You are able to take sound out of a picture. So what does it actually mean?? It means that, the sound which we have extracted from that photo, is the sound which was going on when the picture was taken in the 1/infinite th of a sec. And, if the sound extracted was a 5 sec clip, then it means that the 5 sec audio was playing in just 1/infinite th second. Does it really make sense??

I am certain In due time someone in the near future  will create a device possibly using laser or sonar to actually read the walls in those old buildings and strip back layer after layer of nearly  every sound in reverse  sequential order. If not all at least some. The theory and idea leads me to another  theories that clairvoyant people may be legit and  have super hyper sensitivity to inaudible sound  and or light vibration unseen and inaudible  to most people and may be what they pick up on. I have met people with hyper sensative senses and those senses I am told can also be trained to a degree.", "comment_date": "2021-10-19T09:11:07Z", "likes_count": 2}, {"comment_by": "Scrapperdoodle", "comment_text": "&quot;can you hear pictures?&quot;<br>mr krabs walk cycle:", "comment_date": "2021-10-18T10:19:54Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "katexx_osu", "comment_text": "Veritasium: is it possible to hear sound from image<br>Me: <b>look at bohemian rhapsody poster</b>", "comment_date": "2021-10-18T02:56:43Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Sir Meliodas", "comment_text": "pretty much cyberpunk", "comment_date": "2021-10-18T02:02:58Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Checheno", "comment_text": "<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUzB0L0mSCI&amp;t=4m49s\">4:49</a> Epic Teacher moment.", "comment_date": "2021-10-17T18:37:25Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Manemisdon Malasnemissalatan", "comment_text": "imagine if the technology improved to a point where it can translate realtime", "comment_date": "2021-10-16T12:12:16Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Danielle Wilson", "comment_text": "I like how even if it\u2019s not correct, it still sounds cool", "comment_date": "2021-10-16T07:18:18Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Simply Wonderful", "comment_text": "That&#39;s some insane spy tech", "comment_date": "2021-10-14T21:20:14Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Stephen S", "comment_text": "For a real-world example of this being useful, Scott Manley has a video &quot;What does a meteor hitting a spacecraft sound like?&quot;", "comment_date": "2021-10-14T02:17:46Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "S D", "comment_text": "It&#39;s like lip reading the nature.

That being said, and me not being an expert, I would expect the frequencies you could recover would be about 1/2 of the frame rate, or a little below, and this would depend on some surface in the video being vibrated enough to be detectable.  I would expect that in order to recover human speech with some degree of quality, you would need a frame rate of around 4,000 frames per second, which would allow you to capture the most common frequencies in human speech.  Again, this depends on a surface in the video being vibrated strongly enough to be detectable.  The most common frame rates, from 29.95 frames per second up to about 60 frames per second would most likely not yield usable results.  This is my guess, based on what little I know.  Now, on to the video and see if my guess has any merit.<br><br>Now at the end of the video.  It appears that my statement I made at the beginning is correct.

On that equipemnt you should run a sine-sweep to learn which areas resonate at which frequencies.<br>Unfortunately you&#39;ll find that it will not resonate in low frequencies because it is too light. So there should be a clever algorithm which gathers frequencies which are harmonics and combine them to get the actual base-frequency. With that approach you should be able to recover audio from more normal equipment and in much better fidelity.", "comment_date": "2020-09-13T21:47:25Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "HoeDoe", "comment_text": "<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUzB0L0mSCI&amp;t=4m23s\">4:23</a> it&#39;s not much but it&#39;s honest work", "comment_date": "2020-09-13T20:26:17Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Cameron", "comment_text": "<b>NSA has entered the chat</b>", "comment_date": "2020-09-13T19:04:52Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Ben Hutchinson", "comment_text": "And even the below method I mentioned about a waveform graph would be a round-about way of spying on your conversations.

Instead, the biggest threat to your audio privacy, is going to be malware on your computer, that activates your microphone and then sends a live audio stream back over the internet to the hacker&#39;s computer.

And here&#39;s why.<br><br>The bandwidth of a video camera is WAY too low. Voice audio tends to include frequencies between 200Hz and 6000Hz. I&#39;ve discovered through lowpass filtering sounds in audio software on my PC, that if you cut the highest frequency too much below 6000Hz, the human voice starts to lose intelligibility, ESPECIALLY for letters like S that have a high frequency noise component.  If you are using this as a spying technique, you will need to have a camera that can record oscillations up to 6000Hz. Of course, due to the Nyquist limit, if you want a bandwidth of 6000Hz, you will need a sample rate of 12000 Samp/Sec. The sample rate of a video camera is called its frame rate, and MOST cameras don&#39;t have a frame rate of 12000fps. Most consumer cameras have video recording at either 30fps or 60fps, and are completely useless for recording most audio (having bandwidths of 15Hz or 30Hz, meaning either no audible sound or only the lowest frequency audible sounds possible).<br><br>Some expensive professional digital video cameras (like those used to film Hollywood movies, costing in the range of about $5000 to about $50000) may have a setting in its configuration menu that would let you set it to record ad frame rates up to 120fps, or 240fps in rare cases. Even that though, would at best allow you to hear sounds up to 120Hz. This cuts off all but the lowest frequencies of the human voice, and wouldn&#39;t allow you to hear any words a person spoke.<br><br>To do this experiment properly, your camera would need to record at up to 12000 fps, and that would require a dedicated high speed scientific camera. You&#39;d be LUCKY to find one at less than $10000, and they can easily cost over $100000 for the higher end ones.<br><br>I actually have a decent Nikon digital camera, the Nikon1 J5, which is a consumer-level camera and cost only $500, and it has a high speed video recording setting that lets it have speeds up to 1200fps, which is still only ONE TENTH the required framerate to do this experiment properly. Its bandwidth is only 600Hz, and regarding voice audio, would produce only a very low-pitch &quot;mumbling&quot; sound for the human voice. You would not be able to make out ANY words the person was saying. And due to the huge amount of data this recording mode generates, it depends on an internal high speed RAM buffer in the camera to immediately record the data from the image sensor, before later saving it to the SD card for permanent storage, after the recording has finished. This internal RAM is relatively small, and allows only 3 seconds of recording in this mode (though upon playback at normal 30fps speed on your computer, it runs for 2 entire minutes). Even if the 600hz bandwidth somehow were enough for certain tasks, it only allows recording 3 seconds at a time, which makes it basically useless for audio spying, where you would want to run a continuous recording session during the entire conversation you were trying to eavesdrop on.", "comment_date": "2020-09-13T09:25:03Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "dsleech", "comment_text": "So basically this is use for spying", "comment_date": "2020-09-13T06:12:22Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Bizzarrus", "comment_text": "<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUzB0L0mSCI&amp;t=5m27s\">5:27</a> Actually, you need to sample <b>more</b> than twice that frequency.

It was developed in order to reconstruct private, sometimes classified, conversations among various western industrial, scientific, governmental, security, and intelligence personnel.  It was far more sophisticated in its methods than what is nicely portrayed here.  I found the Russian method brilliant, beautiful, and stupendous technologically.  It required meetings taking place in rooms with large glass windows.  The basic method was to measure vibrations, extremely tiny, in the glass plates of the windows caused by the speech in the room.  To do this, clearly, extreme sensitivity to tiny relative movements is required.  This was accomplished with low intensity blue frequencies laser light, although use of lower resolution IR frequencies was eventually perfected, since the blue frequencies ones had to be set down to very low intensity not to be visible to the participants in a meeting.  The technique fundamentally used multiple lasers directed at different points on the glass, and not just simple bounceback from the glass.  Rather, the technique used the <b>interference patterns</b> of the light reflected from various pairs of the lasers.  Comparing different pairs and isolating the interference patterns common to two or more pairs would eliminate extraneous sounds (like street noise).  It was brilliant, they worked out the technical challenges, and it was fully capable of reconstructing good sound.  Damn the Russkies!  However, one simply has to praise their physical sciences and, perhaps even more so, their mathematics.  Many reading this will recognise some fundamental similarity of this technique and those used to produce holograms.  The ability of interference patterns to capture truly exquisite detail is outstanding.", "comment_date": "2020-08-17T22:18:13Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Art N Design", "comment_text": "I have a idea, all camera are 30fps to 120fps but We can use many camera and Camera start at deferents micro seconds and all frame mix a more fps video and we find out Sound.", "comment_date": "2020-08-17T15:55:48Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Exynouz", "comment_text": "The titles says images while it&#39;s a video", "comment_date": "2020-08-17T13:37:58Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Samayah Abdi", "comment_text": "Energy converts to other energy.

So, as we ear frequency between 20Hz and 20kHz, we\u2019ve chosen 44,1kHz. I hope this is understandable.

One issue is the doppler effect of sound itself which doesn&#39;t really involve quantum mechanics directly as this is just a property of sound over time and moving objects. However, the camera, the object of observation, and the audio source are all static or stationary so this shouldn&#39;t have a major impact and may be disregarded in this particular case. It should still be a consideration for other environmental setups. Another topic that you might need to take into consideration is the property of the fact that objects absorb sound and the fact that sound dissipates over time and distance traveled along with the density, temperature, and pressure of the medium in which the sound is traveling through or into. One of the major issues that need to be taken into an account that does pertain to quantum mechanics is that of Photons and the Act of observation itself. How objects react to light and the presence of an observer human or nonhuman such as a camera or a sensor can have an effect on the overall behavior of the system. Besides all of this, I do like the concept of this experiment and the overall direction in which it is heading. I do tend to believe even without evidence that there is some truth and possibility to your original hypothesis and theory. I tend to believe that because Sound is vibrational energy in the form of wave motion and that it does interact with that of Light Energy it has the effect of imprinting on objects. If Sound didn&#39;t imprint on objects that it travels through then we wouldn&#39;t remember those that we love and care about, we wouldn&#39;t be moved by music to our liking and the such, and we wouldn&#39;t be able to have the ability to hear or listen in the first place!

You are recovering sounds from a video not really &quot;images&quot;.<br>Images seem to refer still images not a video (which is like thousands of pictures combined together).<br>I was kinda baffled when I heard the title because I thought there was gonna be some super intelligent technique to get sound from stills. What the video actually shows is basically video taping the vibrations from a driver and reverse engineering it. Video would be alot color if we see the exact reverse engineering process rather than a display of a ln existing concept.<br>Furthermore, stereophonic tech has been around since 1930, and recording tech since the 1880&#39;s. It would be much easier and accurate to record sound through a mic than through a video. With a mic, the vibration is induced/conducted directly onto the diaphragm. There&#39;s alot less variables and it&#39;s much more practical. Using images on the other hand is not practical nor is it accurate. The sound travels and vibrates to a piece of object (losing energy depending on the material) and the same time as the camera is trying to pick it up, other variables come into play like that picture noise mentioned in the vid. It&#39;s highly impractical because it requires an object within the location of noise and requires a high quality camera to look at the object. Data saved are huge because they are images and takes time to decode and reverse engineer. Compared to the microphone where it is small, compact, recorded data is small and analysis is simple, I can&#39;t see how the concept from the video is practical at all.<br><br>In fact, the laser microphone has already utilized this effect in a degree already, by using lasers to detect sound vibrations. It&#39;s accuracy is way beyond this technique and much more practical. This video is basically redundant.<br><br>Idk y but I&#39;m so infuriated that I&#39;ve been duped to watch a redundant video from a YouTuber (that usually puts really interesting stuff) that I would gladly spend time just to dish out this rant.

They would set up stereo microphones all over a town, then digitally squash the sound and bring it to a central hub, where an &quot;algorythm&quot;/mixer would bring to the front any sounds that were out of the ordinary. So if a car were to drive through the town its &quot;noise profile&quot; would be passed on incrementally and not be flagged. But a gun shot, scream, alarm, etc would immediately flag the system and just by measuring the audio you could almost exactly pin point the event. They had a lot of success but it was dropped because the amount of data and sampling rates were too much to use and store in those days and the sampling and analyzing in busy areas took some time to process.

You say that having a camera that shoots at 30fps will miss most of a 30Hz signal and that it will only capture only 1 point in the signal (with the same amplitude) every time.<br><br>However I believe this is wrong (from your explanation per example). Having 2 signals (let&#39;s say f0 and f1) each with the same frequency, the only way they will intersect (which is essentially the recording) in the same point over and over again is if the two signals are not synchronized. So, the first signal would have f0(0) = 0 but the second signal would have f1(0.5) = 0, that would mean that the recording function (f1) would always intersect f0 at the same amplitude point throughout time -&gt; what you&#39;re drawing.<br><br>If you have a 30fps camera and a 30Hz signal, you can capture that signal completely, if you start the recording at t0 when the signal starts. However, synchronizing the two functions is very difficult and that is why the sampling rate increases, so you could capture more points with your recording function so that you can get the relative frequency of your source signal f0.<br><br>In the end, the problem is not with frequencies being different or the same, but with the starting point in time of the recording.", "comment_date": "2019-05-15T10:42:05Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Chris Ilias", "comment_text": "Thank you for doing this I really learned a lot...", "comment_date": "2019-05-15T01:40:21Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Cait Lunsford", "comment_text": "sick beats \ud83d\ude29\ud83d\udd25\ud83d\udc4c\ud83d\udcaf", "comment_date": "2019-05-15T00:46:51Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "samsalabamgames", "comment_text": "i have been wondering about this FOR YEARS!", "comment_date": "2019-05-15T00:17:11Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "WaxxyOne", "comment_text": "So basically you&#39;re saying that the NSA can film conversations taking place far away or through sound-proof glass so long as there is a suitable material which both captures the vibration and is flimsy enough to move visibly.... like... tin... foil.<br><br>OH MY GOD.

As the speed of sound is 343m/s, at 30Hz each frame will show a 11.43m long part of the sound wave. If you filmed an 12 meters long object with 10 equally distant reference points on it (or 10 separate objects arranged in a 12 meters long queue) you have just multiplied your sampling frequency by 10, to an effective 300Hz, being able to measure sound up to 150Hz. If you had 100 such reference objects 12 centimeters from each other then you increased your sampled sound frequency to 1500Hz. At this frequency even human speech would be reconstructable.

The patent was granted, but he was not notified about that from the patent dept. but rather from a US National Security bureaucrat who told him that the patent was granted and then siezed by the govt.   According to the laws the govt had to purchase the patent and he had to sell it to them so they could be lawful owner.   Govt paid him $800 and classified the technology as top secret, which included a gag order on him.  They didn&#39;t say why it was being classified but he had a good guess:   He had generalized the patent to cover bouncing the laser off any surface that acted like  a membrane, and had, before filing, actually tested on many materials including window panes.   Turns out he bounced the laser at 45 deg  off a house&#39;s window pane from 50 ft away and was able to clearly hear conversations inside the house.

The foil was shaped purposely to a specific shape for both so called \u201ctests\u201d. Therefore, if a person shaped a flexible object to mimic the sound that is attempting to be captured through a photograph, the results would have been created, but not  actually produced if that makes sense. Shaping a foil to have shorter ridges here and longer ones there would be for the extent of the notes played throughout the beat of a song in terms of quarter notes, half notes, whole notes etc. The foil was not rolled into a ball shape and if it was, then perhaps the test would have had a different outcome which would not have been a biased one in my opinion. This test was altogether counterintuitive considering of course sound can be heard from an image seen and or witnessed. For instance, imagine this, if a car were to be blasting music and the bass of a song was moving the entire car in such a way that a noticeable movement could be seen, but not heard as say you were wearing headphones, and if say the cars motion and bass of the song were to Queen\u2019s \u201cWe Will Rock You\u201d then, someone who recalled the beat could conclude that the movement of the car resembles the beat of the song. Furthermore if a person were singing a song and you bear witness to their performance from a car away as they appear to be lip syncing, the movement of their lips would help you identify the song they are actually singing despite the fact that you could not actually hear the song playing in their car. These men knew the song that was playing first off and we do not know if the foil was first off shaped to mimic short note ridges and long note ridges here and there. How the frequency was captured and then produced into a graph like red photo with hits of yellow on screen @ <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUzB0L0mSCI&amp;t=8m28s\">8:28</a> was never truly explained. All we hear as viewers is that there was a mysterious code used. I would need to see this experiment redone while the person testing the theory simply receives a photograph of still frames, not having heard the song played, and thus needs to decipher the sound and beat coming from photograph using the motion caught within still frames.", "comment_date": "2019-03-02T14:41:13Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Felipems", "comment_text": "What about making this with vibrating coffee?", "comment_date": "2019-03-02T14:37:52Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "dragonslayerlance", "comment_text": "Can you use ray tracing tech to emulate sound?

But I noticed a small discrepancy in your explanation of the Nyquist theorem which I wanted to point out. You said that for a sound to be captured you have to sample it AT LEAST twice per cycle, when in reality, it has to be sampled any amount MORE than twice per cycle. The reason is that, for a frequency of n, a sample rate of 2n could by chance capture the wave exactly at each zero crossing or close to it, resulting in either a silent or very quiet recording. It\u2019s a small distinction but I think it\u2019s important because it shows the incredible accuracy of digital audio sampling. Because of this principle, even with a sample rate of 2.0001n you can perfectly capture a sound with a frequency of n!", "comment_date": "2019-03-02T07:14:06Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Livin That Life", "comment_text": "haha he types beep boop beep and then he hears some beep boop beep", "comment_date": "2019-03-02T07:12:28Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "pingu", "comment_text": "but can you recover images from sound?", "comment_date": "2019-03-02T07:10:55Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "stylomojo", "comment_text": "GREETING, HI I AM ARTIST tell me how my album cover will give away sound on user&#39;s pc as demo?

So if a spy could receive its electromagnetic (EM) emissions, he could see what was on the screen. Tempest was established, so that EM was contained with the monitor, and not emitted.<br><br><br>Leon Theremin, the same guide that invented the theremin, created a very successful ease dropping device, was installed in the US Embassy, in Moscow. It was a simple, mostly wooden plaque, gifted to the Embassy, by the Soviets. It contained a passive tuned circuit (inductor and capacitor) that was custom made to have those components properities, but not look like anything electrical. At 330MHz, simple brass trim becomes a very good inductor. I believe, the &quot;capacitor&quot;, also acted as a microphone. If a constant level EM signal was beamed at it. As someone spoke, near that plaque, the tuned circuit would go in, and out of tune. This would effect how much energy it absorb from that outside EM beam, and the senders of that beam would detect the power variation (see grid dip meter), hence listen to that speech. Looking for active bugs, would not detect this device, as it was passive, and did not emit any power itself.
