I feel obliged to clarify. I largely agree with @Armaros and @EebstertheGreat. Just want to elaborate a bit more.\r<br>First thing first, a = F/m. a is the acceleration in question. m is the mess of jumper. Given he doesn&#39;t pee or fart in between, we can assume his mess, m, doesn&#39;t change:) We can simply focus on F.\r<br>There are different forces pulling the jumper. \r<br>1. Fg - The gravity. Given consistent mess of jumper and the very short distance of movement compared to radius of the Earth, we can assume it doesn&#39;t change. Let&#39;s use its direction as positive.\r<br>2. Fr - The pulling force of bungee rope. Its direction is opposite to gravity. Its magnitude changed along the way. \r<br>3. Fa - Air resistance pointed out by @EebstertheGreat . It is small compared with the other two. But we should still take into consideration. It is a bit nasty that its direction is opposite of the moving direction. When jumper is moving down, its direction is opposite to Fg. When he bounced back, its direction is same as Fg.\r<br>\r<br>Now let&#39;s exam the force on jumper for all choices with an important assumption that the weight of rope doesn&#39;t count:\r<br>\r<br>a) F = Fg. The rope hasn&#39;t begun to pull. Fr is 0. Fa is also 0 because of the 0 speed.\r<br>\r<br>b) F= Fg - Fr - Fa. Both Fr and Fa are still small. Fg &gt; (Fr + Fa). abs(F) &lt; abs(Fg)\r<br>\r<br>c) F= 0. Since jumper reached max speed at c. That means Fr + Fa just matched Fg and began to overtake. Fa reached its maximum value at this point. Fr will keep growing when the rope is stretched further.\r<br>\r<br>d) F = Fg - Fr. Fa is 0 due to 0 speed.\r<br>\r<br>e) The video simply said e is &#39;on the rebound&#39;. This is not clear. Rebound is a long process from the d to the point he reached maximum height, which let&#39;s call it f) to simplify the discussion. Before jumper reached f)\r<br>\r<br>F = Fg - Fr + Fa. Fr reduced to 0 in the process. That is where you saw the rope looks like a shape of J.\r<br>\r<br>f) F = Fg.\r<br>\r<br>Overall Fa is way smaller than Fg and Fr. We can ignore until we compare two number only differed by Fa.\r<br>Also, the acceleration could be either direct just like F itself. We have to compare abs(F)\r<br>\r<br>Now let&#39;s pick the answer.\r<br>a) ties with f)\r<br>c) won&#39;t be the answer obviously.\r<br>e) won&#39;t be the answer because Fr in e) smaller than Fr in d) When Fa is noticeable, Fr is already way smaller.\r<br>\r<br>Now let&#39;s focus on d). If abs(Fr) &gt; 2 * abs(Fg), then it is the answer. As many already pointed out. There is no guarantee. From the video, the upward acceleration from bottom up didn&#39;t seem to be greater than the downward acceleration when he started either. But I am not 100% sure.\r<br>\r<br>If the rope is an inelastic steel cable, jumper will bounce back as fast as basketball bounced back from ground. In that case, I bet d) will be the answer.

It seemed like it could be A for low values of spring constant, but I made a simulation of this problem and changed up values of K, and found that the limit as K approaches zero results in the total net acceleration approaching g (from above). This means that the tension force at point D must be more than double the gravitational force meaning that point D does infact have a greater magnitude of acceleration for all values of K greater than zero. This makes sense mathematically because as K approaches zero, the extension of the cord quickly approaches infinity. You can also picture the bungee jumper as an example of harmonic motion with an initial velocity greater than zero. <br>The one reason why this wouldn&#39;t be true is due to air resistance. In a scenario where you consider air resistance, if the spring constant is too low, than point A becomes the point of greatest acceleration. Adding air resistance to the model, if you plot spring constant on the x axis and drag coefficient on the y axis, you get a line below which point D is the highest acceleration, and above which point A is the highest acceleration.

The force it exerts will increase (exponentially) the more it is stretched which decreases the net downward force thereby decreasing acceleration (velocity continues to increase). At some point along the path the force becomes equal to the force of gravity but momentum pushes the jumper past that point. This is the point at which three jumper reaches max velocity and zero acceleration. The force the bungee exerts on the jumper continues to increase as the jumper passes the point of balanced forces creating an increasing net upward force and the jumper begins accelerating in the opposite direction (even though direction of travel is still downward). However, unless the absolute force exerted on the jumper from the bungee EXCEEDS twice the force exerted by gravity, acceleration will not be greater than free fall even at the moment the jumper changes direction.
