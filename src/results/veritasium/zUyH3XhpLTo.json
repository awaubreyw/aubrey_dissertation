A liquid! Now I\u2019ll explain what happens when this condensation takes place and something crashes into it? Because the star has now become a pool of liquid fuel? We can assume that it will have high density and cooler temperatures than the star would? Two things cannot occupy the same space right? Ok well, the black hole is forced to take in materials that it\u2019s sucked up in its own gravity? It will spin these items around itself at light speed making major friction and along with the high temp from the crashing atoms we find that time itself slows down and nothing can move?

Also e.x. how a space can be curved, extended into itself etc and how a typically known matter behaves then, if it goes into such a space in space situation, would you see it behind the hole? Would it then simultaneously be seen and or located in that space as the space behind the extension or would it be on the same vertical level like the hole, 2d from the front until you enter the space.

We can apply that -1 dimension to a scale higher than us, 4D, and apply the same rule if our universe is a black hole (the black hole universe theory).  Which would mean that time as a dimension is lost outside the event horizon from the perspective of those on the inside. What this means, is that if a black hole creates a new universe inside it (repeat indefinitely), it is effectively channeling time as a dimension through infinite perpetual layers of universes. Basically, the universe is a tunnel that feeds off its own self and sheds it. Like an ouroboros. Our computer monitors shows 3D from 2D, black holes show 2D from 3D. If black holes lose a dimension much like our screen gives the illusion of gaining a dimension. We view our world as 3D being in 4D. Then maybe our own universe is also 2D, but 3D inside. By that I mean - our universe on the SMALLEST level appear 3D to us. But our universe as a WHOLE, on a GRAND SCALE, could be 2D if we zoomed out far enough. By zooming out even more the 2D universe could appear as a tiny dot, as 1D.   <br>  <br>So to put it simply. It could be that existence is 1D, then 2D further in, then 3D, then 4D etc. Based on the viewpoint of the observer. Meaning that the more compressed - the more &quot;advanced&quot; everything gets. So that the least destructive base universe is the most static / safest / constant, while increasing room for change - including life - also comes at the cost of having less and less power to manipulate the layers before it. Think of the universe as a donut where the skin of the donut is constantly moving, but the backside is like a traffic cone. A tail if you will. The universe eats itself eternally to sustain itself. So time... time is the effect we get from an existence which has to move infinitely to self sustain.  <br>  <br>I&#39;m kinda high I have no idea what I just wrote.", "comment_date": "2021-12-15T06:34:10Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "E- Dogg", "comment_text": "You didn\u2019t make it easy to understand, so I lost interest and and left before the video ended !

My question is this, since the planets follow a geodesic around the sun, how long will it take for those planets to collide into the sun? What physics controls the spacing between planets and their star? Is chemistry a factor? For instance, do some gases of mercury&#39;s atmosphere have any repulsion to the sun? Basically, how does mercury&#39;s atmosphere interacts with the sun. What about the cores of the planets. The core does emit a magnetic field, I wonder if magnetism from the core of planets and stars give off the illusion of gravity by bending particles around that celestial body which in turn leads to what appears to be gravity wells. I wonder if this magnetism attracts some particles and repulse other particles. If you look at the magnetic field of earth and its interactions with particles from the sun, you will see a geodesic effect around that magnetic field.

Atoms are formed from electrons waving or orbiting or clouding around a tiny nucleus and contain 99.999999% empty space.<br><br>This is a simple lie. Such atoms cannot make up solid or in-compressible matters, such as diamond and water.<br><br>2. The sun is a fusion reactor, constantly radiate light and heat energy into space around it.<br><br>This is a lie. Energy must co-existing with matter. Space contains no energy, no light, no heat, no force, no field, no wave, no photon. There is no fusion reaction at all. The sun is just a hot mass. The more atoms attract together the higher temperature the mass has. Bigger stars are hotter. The sun only radiate energy to matters around it, such as earth and moon. Energy cannot radiate into empty space, otherwise, a vacuum metal container can replace all cooling systems.<br><br>3. The universe is formed some billion years ago and will end in some billion years.<br><br>Stupid lie. According to proven physics laws, matter and energy are conserved, cannot be created or destroyed, the universe must be self-existing and immortal existing. The big bang theory is a big fart from retard physicists.<br><br>4. Solar wind constantly blow out from the sun, those charged electrons and protons hit earth atmosphere to produce polar lights.<br><br>Lies. No mass, no particle can escape the sun&#39;s gravity. If solar wind is real, where are all the electrons and protons in the wind go from the past? Vanished into space is impossible, fall on planets is impossible, otherwise, earth atmosphere hydrogen ppm will keep increasing. If solar wind is real, then its direction is sun-earth, impossible to produce swirling polar lights. Polar lights are produced from westward circling sunlight energy in the atmosphere.<br><br>5. In electromagnetism, current flows back and forth in an antenna can produce electromagnetic waves.<br><br>Obvious lie. Current only flows back and forth in a closed circuit not a terminal, such as antenna. Power lines have high current flow but where is the EM wave? EM wave does not exist, a misinterpretation of electrostatic wave in the medium/air.<br><br>6. Black hole and gravity wave are real, scientists won Nobel Prize.<br><br>Evil lies. Black hole does not exist. The only black hole is between lying physicists dumb legs. Gravity wave is existing within the mass, such as earthquake wave. There is nothing existing in vacuum space, no light, no photon, no EM wave, no force, no field, no spacetime ripples, no curvature, no radiation, no solar wind, no Van Allen Belts, no black hole, no neutron star, no big bang, no space expending. All lies.<br><br>7. Tide is caused by sun&#39;s and moon&#39;s gravity.<br><br>Obvious lie. Scientists say gravity is not a force but the curvature of spacetime. What exactly is spacetime? What exactly is the curvature of spacetime? How does it cause tide?<br>Tide is absolutely not causing by gravity. Gravity is perpendicular to sea level, impossible to move water horizontally. Simple fact.<br>All sea waters on earth are accelerating to the center at 9.8 m/ss, not accelerating to the sun or moon. To be exactly, westward circling sunlight energy in the ocean and atmosphere causing tide, atmospheric wind, and earth magnetic force/so called magnetic field<br><br>A lot more, I am so tired to list them.<br><br>Religion and science are the evilest thing on earth. People use them to scam $ and fame. Scientist all do. Fusion, space mission, space telescope, black hole, gravity wave are all lies.<br><br>Particle accelerator their evil asses.

The reason the shadow is bigger than the hole is not related to the stable innermost orbit, it&#39;s actually due to the photon sphere. Let me explain.<br><br>Light from behind the black hole can&#39;t reach us if it slips within the photon sphere and is not reflected back by something, so everything behind the photon sphere looks black. That&#39;s the actual shadow the hole casts. However, matter falling into the photon sphere can still emit light that will reach us, because the light it emits is not travelling toward the black hole (it&#39;s aimed right at us), provided it has not yet slipped past the event horizon.

You get off on the gullibility of the people believing whatever you say. And it&#39;s a fact that you Black Hole science can&#39;t even agree among yourselves what it is and how it works etc... because there&#39;s no such thing (yes I read those science magazines). Most of the idea of the Black Hole comes from these sciences growing up watching lots of SCI-FI movies. Star Gate, Star Trek, Contact, etc..., with Wormholes and stuff like that. All you have at best is a bunch of pictures you can&#39;t understand so you guess what you think it is. In reality, you don&#39;t have the first clue what you are looking at nor talking about! What the Hubble Telescope can capture some nice pictures but it&#39;s still a zillion light-year away from what it&#39;s capturing. I remember clearly when all the sciences thought the dust on the moon(which is in our own backyard!) would be several feet thick! But when Neil Armstrong stepped on the moon for the first time it turned out to be less than an inch thick! So if you can&#39;t even tell what our own moon was all about, there&#39;s no way in the world you know about something that is out of our reach.

What&#39;s your name? nice work you&#39;re doing with your channel. <br>How about a video on what happens after the death? What is the purpose of our existence. <br>OR another Idea:<br>I personally think, that and it is not just a belief; it is a calculated thought, that our universe, is not physical at all, but it is a state of mind. It is a perception. Nothing physical is actually physical at all. Our universe Itself, does actually NOT exist on physical plane, although it is very convincing through our 5 senses that i does. I came up to this idea, as I was thinking about the size of the universe.  That is also by the way why I said that it is somewhat calculated thought. The thought about the physical size of universe is, that the universe cannot possibly have a physical size, at all; it is impossible! <br>Why, you ask? <br>The reason is that for any particular object under observation to be measured against its physical size, we have to determine its boundaries; its corners; the line which determines its confines; something that tells us that okay, let&#39;s say a box has 6 walls. Each of the wall has an ending point where its last atoms will be occupying the physical space of the box. After which, there will be no more atoms of that box, but just air. So there is a line, a wall, a boundary of any kind or state of matter; be it liquid and solid  boundary, as in beach and sand. Or be it water sprinkled in air. Every water drop has its boundary until the surrounding air starts. <br><br>The universe my friend, cannot possibly has a boundary. Let us assume for a second that it does have a boundary, be it in the plasma, solid, gaseous or liquid state; There will always be something outside of that boundary/wall/line. <br>Let&#39;s go another step further, assuming even one more thing that the boundary is a loop, like our Earth (which seems straight by our 5 senses but is actually round, and we cannot escape due to its very round nature, gravity and atmosphere and many other factors), even in that very case, if we are in a whirlpool kind of swirling medium which confines the universe, still there universe will not end there. Because there will always be something outside of this swirling, captivating, encompassing, confining medium... <br>So we start walking in the right dimension, (e.g. going upper direction on earth)  the physical space is infinite. After the farthest galaxy we will find 1 billion years later, and even after our existence, there will always be something next to it. <br>It simply means, that it is not the physical space that exists; it is the perception of it which does!<br><br>I would love you to make a nice, well thought, well organised, with no drama or dramatic music in the background,  but just well discussed and well-argumented video about this topic... nobody has found the answer of it; I do not expect you to have it either; what I want you to do is, to try finding one...", "comment_date": "2021-01-12T21:53:49Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Lakshmy Vijayan", "comment_text": "Something is still bugging even after your  wonderfully put explanation.

Magari anche solo in parte in un concorso di fattori concomitanti.<br>Mi spiego.<br>So che le lenti gravitazionali sono quel fenomeno prima teorizzato e poi osservato in conseguenza del quale la gravit\u00e0 esercitata da grandi masse di materia curva lo spazio tempo e quindi anche la luce, fenomeno in conseguenza del quale la luce delle stelle che ci dovrebbero apparire in una data posizione ci appaiono in una posizione diversa rispetto a quella reale.<br><br>Tuttavia vorrei esporre una ipotesi diversa e forse un po&#39; fantasiosa, o pi\u00f9 che altro un dubbio dovuto a mia curiosit\u00e0 di esploratore ai limiti della conoscenza.<br>Noi sapiamo che se immergiamo una canna in una vasca d&#39;acqua la canna ci appare spezzata. Questo accade per via della differente densit\u00e0 dei mezzi in cui si trova la canna ovvero l&#39;aria e l&#39;acqua. Poich\u00e9 in questi mezzi di diversa densit\u00e0 la luce si muove a differenti velocit\u00e0 in conseguenza del quale abbiamo un fenomeno di rifrazione e quindi noi percepiamo la canna come se fosse spezzata. La differenza di densit\u00e0 dell&#39;aria e delle micro goccie d&#39;acqua in sospensione \u00e8 anche causa dell&#39;arcobaleno che \u00e8 esso stesso un altra manifestazione del fenomeno ottico di rifrazione della luce.<br>Ora se noi guardiamo a grandi distanze ad esempio da una montagna verso un&#39;altra montagna vediamo che il grande numero degli strati di aria che si susseguono rendono la montagna lontana di colore diverso rispetto a quello che \u00e8 in natura: tendiamo infatti a vedere le cose molto lontane di un colore bluastro.<br>Le lenti di vetro o cristallo modificano la direzione della luce sempre in base alla diversa densit\u00e0 della lente rispetto all&#39;aria che le circonda e la luce passando da un mezzo (aria) all&#39;altro (lente) modifica la sua direzione di conseguenza.<br>Spostiamoci ora nello spazio. Qui abbiamo distanze enormi di &quot;vuoto cosmico&quot;. Ma nel vuoto cosmico non vi \u00e8 un vuoto assoluto e totale: vi sono rari atomi e pulviscolo spaziale di dimensioni variabili. Con le grandi distanze cosmiche \u00e8 possibile che il susseguirsi di strati dopo strati dopo strati... di questo mezzo composto da atomi e pulviscolo spaziale ecc. di spessore crescente viste le enormi distanze agisca un po&#39; come agisce l&#39;atmosfera, l&#39;acqua, il vetro, il cristallo, ecc. quando viene attraversata dalla luce andando quindi a generare un effetto ottico e non gravitazionale? Ora per dare un nome a questo effetto ipotetico chiamiamolo &quot;lente ottica cosmica&quot; invece di lente gravitazionale.<br>Si pu\u00f2 confutare questa possibilit\u00e0 (ovvero dell&#39;esistenza dell&#39;effetto di lente ottica cosmica come ipotizzato e definito sopra) e dire <b>per certo</b> che non sia vera allo stato attuale delle conoscenze d&#39;astrofisica moderna?", "comment_date": "2020-09-29T18:26:27Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Shayna Lawrence", "comment_text": "This was absolutely fascinating!

This is especially true when measuring a black hole where those measurements become a mathematical catastrophe. One good example is the Schwarzschild radius, and for that matter, any other measurements of a black hole.<br><br>The very nature of a singularity is not a Planck length. It is zero. And it&#39;s not just zero, but also infinity. The image of the Messier 87 black hole gives us visual evidence of both the zero nature and infinite nature of the singularity. The image illustrates how space became so infinitely warped, that space warped inward on itself and became inverted inside out. In this image, the dark region of the black hole is no longer warped space, but rather inverted space. So things that once appeared to be small now begin to appear large, and things that once appeared large now begin to appear small.<br><br>This inversion means there is no singularity at the center of the black hole. Instead, the zero-point singularity has now become the outer circumference of the dark region of the black hole, and the dark region of the black hole has become inverted space. To properly measure inside a black hole, you would begin at the circumference of the black hole, the singularity. All points along the circumference are the same zero-point, the singularity. Then you would begin to measure inward toward the center. As you approach the center, your measurement begins to approach infinity. That&#39;s how you measure inside a black hole.<br><br>The realities of zero and infinity can be mind bending. Look it this way, when you look inside a black hole, you are getting a glimpse into a new infinite region, likely another universe just like ours \u2013 a zero dimensional universe where it&#39;s zero-size has become inverted into an infinite size. <br><br>I contend the singularity is what gave stability and form to our young galaxy. If the singularity had a one directional rotation, then it would likely spin around in circles and bash into everything. For this reason, I contend the poles of a galactic singularity should rotate in opposite directions. It is what would give stability to the singularity. This why I contend a side view of a black hole should appear more like a figure eight.<br><br>Done.", "comment_date": "2020-07-29T05:14:34Z", "likes_count": 3}, {"comment_by": "Fermioncool", "comment_text": "Excellent explanation", "comment_date": "2020-07-28T21:46:20Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "barsik", "comment_text": "is that a shade ball ? hehe", "comment_date": "2020-07-28T17:56:47Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Michael Jenje", "comment_text": "Well explained", "comment_date": "2020-07-27T22:06:50Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Zeba Erum", "comment_text": "Complex thing explained in the simplest ever way!!!<br>This vedio was enough to clear all confusions about a black hole..<br>Here you get a new subscriber!! \ud83d\ude4c", "comment_date": "2020-07-27T15:09:05Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "THE ULTIMATE AMAZING", "comment_text": "Why doesn&#39;t the photon sphere collapse into the event horizon while the ray of light does?

Then I started wondering... if a proton emits from its source, and never actually contacts matter as it travels through the universe, does it even exist? Lol, like the tree falling the woods, in a weird way, protons have to intersect or interact with something to have any practical existence. Kind of weird to think about. I\u2019m making some assumptions here. One is that, if the universe expands faster than a proton can ever reach something material, then is it literally stuck in an infinitely non-existent state? I suppose that would also be under the assumption that the universe could possibly expand infinitely but I\u2019d imagine that is unlikely. It\u2019s a weird thought that vision is the result of, among other things, the end of a protons journey. In a weird way, some of those protons are very special. Whenever you look up into the sky, and see a distant point of light, you can think of how those particular protons that may have began their journey many years ago, crossed vast distances in space, just to get to you, your eye. If you\u2019re the sentimental type, you might even think they were tailor made just for your eyes only. The further away they began their journey, the more impressive the idea even.

But in the 70s, Stephen Hawking theorised that black holes radiate energy, until they finally evaporate, by way of quantum processes (&quot;Hawking Radiation&quot;). I&#39;m not a physicist, and to me these two ideas seem contradictory. Radiation would have to be massless, like light, or have mass, like all other fundamental quantum particles, so how can energy in any form escape the singularity&#39;s gravity?

So, where does your &quot;sphere&quot; fits in here? I am quite confused on this\ud83d\ude1f the very famous videos on the internet show this with the help of a cloth tied around a disk and they put a ball on that and it creates a curve. We can see the ball when they talk about planets or Sun but in some videos they put an iron ball quite heavy and it disappears completely and makes a perfect singularity thing. All we can see is a hole on the top... If we see this standing on the top then I can imagine the black thing and light moving/stretching out around the corners and if I see it from an angle, then how can the light go &quot;under that hole and come out from the other side&quot;??

There is a fascinating new hypothesis about the composition of the black hole and the inner workings of the event horizon. First alternative premise being that although black holes are\u00a0measured in terms of stellar mass, due to their size and their field of gravitational acceleration,\u00a0 they do not actually maintain any positive density mass, like baryonic matter. Black holes do not swallow, consume,\u00a0or even pull in positive density mass beyond he event horizon. So how do black holes manage to exhibit a field of gravitational acceleration so strong that no mass particles, or even electromagnetic radiation such as light, can escape from it?The answer is better understood by thinking about gravity a bit differently. In fact, one actually has to reimagine the universe from its perspective make up. Considering the current notion the standard model of cosmology, the current measurements decompose the total energy of the observable universe with 68% dark energy, 27% mass\u2013energy via dark matter, and 5% mass-energy via baryonic matter. So, as black holes are significantly more energy dense than ordinary matter,\u00a0it would then\u00a0make more sense that black holes are a product of dark matter rather than condensed ordinary matter.This requires that we rethink these internal relationships for total energy. Considering the &#39;Big Bang&#39; theory, try thinking of the proposed one dimensional\u00a0template\u00a0for the pre-existing fabric of space-time without any real matter, rather than a singular point as modeled after a gravitational singularity. Then start unfolding it into existence; first into two dimensional space-time, which is an expansion from our one dimensional space-time, and then into a three dimensional space-time and so on. The expectation is that baryonic matter creation took place within a pre-existing\u00a0medium of dark energy. Indeed, the existence of baryonic matter only warps the pre-existing fabric of space-time. Take away the positive density matter and you would still have a vessel in which the matter once existed. Wherein the creation of baryonic matter induces a displacement in the dark energy medium of the space-time fabric. This displacement\u00a0can then be\u00a0known as dark matter, the complement of baryonic matter, and it would appear that it provides baryonic matter with the ability to interact, bond, and evolve.Therefore,\u00a0if the black holes are\u00a0nothing but dark matter, it would also follow that dark matter can be accumulated, separate of baryonic matter. It would also follow that the gravitational force is more representative of dark matter than baryonic matter. Upon this\u00a0hypothesis then, one can expect that there is a require transition to separate baryonic matter from its complementary dark <a href=\"http://matter.it/\">matter.It</a> starts first with the disintegration of matter as it interacts with the event horizon of the black hole. As mass is squeezed upon its own gravitational acceleration toward the black hole, liken to the spaghettification effect, its matter changes to allow for its disintegration via transmutation and the massive release of photons due to alpha decay and beta decay. This is the effect wherein mass is collected within the event horizon, into a plasma, increasing its photon density. The effect is like squeezing out the dark matter from mass, allowing for the baryonic matter to be reduced to its smallest constituent components. The dark matter is then absorbed into the black hole, and the remnants of baryonic matter\u00a0are discarded and\u00a0radiated out at high velocity back into the cosmos.If you&#39;re interested in exploring this concept more, please review the alternative theories presented in the book, &#39;The Evolutioning of Creation: Volume 2&#39;, or even the ramifications of these concepts in the sci-fi fantasy adventure, &#39;Shadow-Forge Revelations&#39;.

Find Eternal Life...<br>1) Faith... in the finished work of Christ (fully man, fully God) and His perfect sacrifice for sins (John <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUyH3XhpLTo&amp;t=3m16s\">3:16</a>)<br><br>2) Repentance ... turning from your fallen mind and ways to God&#39;s Holy ways. (Luke 13:3)<br><br>3) Born again... you must be born of God&#39;s spirit to ever see eternal life. In this new life, He gives you a new heart and mind to then serve Him. (John 3:3, John 3)<br><br>4 ) Holiness with obedience.... if your changed by God you WILL, as fruit, strive to leave all sin, worldliness, carnality and false ways (like man made religion) and obey His commands and be holy in all your ways. (1 Peter <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUyH3XhpLTo&amp;t=1m15s\">1:15</a> / Hebrews 5:9 / Hebrews <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUyH3XhpLTo&amp;t=12m14s\">12:14</a>)<br><br>5) Endure in your faith.... You MUST keep clinging to Christ via this saving faith to the end of your life, lest you fall away and have believed in vain. (Matthew <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUyH3XhpLTo&amp;t=24m13s\">24:13</a>, Matthew 10 and 1 Corinthians 15)<br><br>This is the biblical gospel to eternal life. <b>All without Christ will perish in their sins in Hell, and, ultimately, in the Lake of Fire, for all eternity. Never ending torment. (Romans </b><b><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUyH3XhpLTo&amp;t=3m23s\">3:23</a></b><b>, Hebrews </b><b><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUyH3XhpLTo&amp;t=4m13s\">4:13</a></b><b>, Romans </b><b><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUyH3XhpLTo&amp;t=6m23s\">6:23</a></b><b>, Revelations 20).</b><br><br>The gospel is not just a religious action. No, it changes your entire life and you NO LONGER live for yourself but live to serve God alone. Jesus said you MUST worship God in spirit and truth. John <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUyH3XhpLTo&amp;t=4m24s\">4:24</a><br><br>(Critical &amp; Essential Note: To understand God&#39;s word, you have to have faith that God exists (Hebrews 11:6); have to repent and open up to God. God will give you wisdom and understanding (and a new life/being born again) if you sincerely repent and let Him help you, for He is the Word of God (John 1:1). If you don&#39;t, you will NEVER understand it in God&#39;s truth. This statement comes from the experience of a true follower of Christ whose fruit is complete obedience to the full and complete Gospel and God, by God&#39;s standards in His Word. Only then will you truly understand the Word of God/Bible. This is part of the many reasons why knowing, having, and sharing the complete gospel is so important for the true followers of Christ, and for those who don&#39;t know the things of God, unbelievers, and false christian converts.)<br><br>Most Christians will be denied by Jesus Christ because they don&#39;t follow all of what the bible says. If you love Jesus Christ, you keep his commandments (John <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUyH3XhpLTo&amp;t=14m15s\">14:15</a>). We are to obey God as fruit (Not works!!!) to show that we are His! (John <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUyH3XhpLTo&amp;t=14m23s\">14:23</a>, James <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUyH3XhpLTo&amp;t=1m22s\">1:22</a>, Luke <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUyH3XhpLTo&amp;t=9m23s\">9:23</a>, and many others).<br><br>Man made traditions, man&#39;s flawed theologies, etc has made God&#39;s commandments of none effect/null/void/useless! (Matthew 15, Mark 7:3-9, Jeremiah 10:1-5, Deuteronomy <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUyH3XhpLTo&amp;t=5m32s\">5:32</a>-33, and many other verses). Repent, be born again, obey God in holiness/obedience, and endure until the end, or Jesus will deny you! (Matthew <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUyH3XhpLTo&amp;t=7m13s\">7:13</a>-29 (v.23)).<br><br>Beware lest any man spoil you through philosophy and vain deceit, after the tradition of men, after the rudiments of the world, and not after Christ. (Colossians 2:8)<br><br>There are some specific exceptions: In Luke <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUyH3XhpLTo&amp;t=23m39s\">23:39</a>-43 The thief on the cross saw Jesus as the Christ. The thief said that he was deserving of the death they were being put through, but said Jesus did not deserve it at all. He saw that he was deserving of death and changed his mind about himself, that he was a sinner and deserved what he was getting. Jesus, in His grace and mercy, forgave this thief and, in turn, the thief was given eternal life. (And Jesus said unto him, Verily I say unto thee, Today shalt thou be with me in paradise. (Luke <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUyH3XhpLTo&amp;t=23m43s\">23:43</a>)) Likewise, when someone who is going to perish or has admitted they were sinners and called out to Jesus to forgive them, He will forgive them if they really mean it. God knows the heart and thoughts of every man. (Matthew 9:4) <br><br>And Jesus said unto him, Verily I say unto thee, Today shalt thou be with me in paradise. (Luke <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUyH3XhpLTo&amp;t=23m43s\">23:43</a>)<br><br>HOWEVER: There is no excuse if someone has (or has had) access to the bible in one way or another (Americans, Europeans, anyone having access to the internet, physical bible, etc). God expects all those who have such resources to use them to gain more understanding of Him and His Word, etc. NO EXCUSES! God knows both the inside and outside of a person. He knows all of your heart and all of your ways. Because of this situation, if we don\u2019t obey, we will have our portion with the unbelievers, and that is ultimately in the lake of fire. (Read Luke 12) So do not practice sin, or this will be your destination.<br><br>God has no pleasure in the death of the wicked (Ezekiel <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUyH3XhpLTo&amp;t=18m23s\">18:23</a>, 32, Ezekiel <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUyH3XhpLTo&amp;t=33m11s\">33:11</a>); why die when you can be forgiven and follow God in every facet of your life and live for eternity in God&#39;s Kingdom? God is not willing that anyone should perish, but come to repentance, and live (2 Peter 3:9). But you still have a choice....<br><br>Bottom line: You are either righteous and walking with God or wicked following satan, the devil. (1 John 3). You will either live for all eternity with Christ because you lived for God and endured until the end, or perish in eternal torment in hell, then the lake of fire because you did not follow God when you had been given the opportunity to have faith in the death and resurrection of Christ (That Christ is God, died for you), repent and change your mind and ways to God&#39;s ways, have received a new heart and mind to serve God in every facet of your life, obey God in holiness, and endure until the end. God will be the just and perfect judge of all this. So repent and live for God so you can live for eternity with Him in His Heavenly Kingdom, will you? The exceptions do apply; God is also merciful.

How do you determine which light is the true image and which light is just bent giving the illusion? How do you know the &quot;true&quot; image of the black hole? Furthermore, if light is bent around these, truly unknown amounts of black holes, black holes then how do we know the image we see as the &quot;universe&quot; is truly the image of how the universe looks in real life? Maybe the universe looks completely different &amp; we are interpreting the universe to look one way when in reality it looks completely different had light not been bent &amp; sent in different directions giving us a different visual structure &amp; furthermore a human eye can&#39;t see extremely quick light shifts so maybe the structure of the universe is changing constantly and we just can&#39;t detect the changes? Has anyone studied that using telescopes for any shifts in perception &amp; if there are no shifts does that mean that the black holes are fixed in relation to it&#39;s surroundings giving a constant image, of which still is altered but unchanging which brings me back to the question of how do we know the true image of the universe if light is bent &amp; sent into different directions? Also, if light ALWAYS travels at the speed of light &amp; doesn&#39;t have mass then how is light influenced by the &quot;gravity&quot; or electromagnetism of the black hole &amp; if light can&#39;t escape at a certain point of the black hole then wouldn&#39;t that be an effective &quot;slowing&quot; of light, especially when the light is effectively trapped at the center of the black hole which the image we see as the universe would effectively be altered due to the slowing of the light giving us an altered perception of the universe?

That is the real space-time distortion of modern thinking, the evidence-conclusion warps of modern con artistry, which is not even done very well here. The actual evidence shows not a black hole but rather a toroidal formation that is quite hot and concentrated but a toriod nonetheless. And that is because gravity is a residual effect of electromagnetism which is itself attractive at a distance but repulsive close up. This explains why electrons do not fall into the nucleus of an atom and why NO theory of planetary or star formation involving a linear separate gravitational force makes any sense, nor are there any observable phenomena in the universe to confirm such things.<br><br>Sorry guys, depictions of what black holes should look like do not match with the image here -  a big and admittedly very hot toroid.

Some, however are more elegant than others. A elegant theory is testable, predictable  and must match observation.\u00a0<br>I&#39;m just a the unquantified YouTuber, but I like to hear everyones ideas and keep an open mind, and never draw conclusions too quickly. <br>There is a branch of scientists that call themselves  &quot;Plasma Cosmologists.&quot; They say that the new image supports their theory that the source of the jets shooting from this supposed Black Hole, is actually a Super Plasmoid. A Super Plasmoid is a torus (donut) shaped magnetic anomaly with a glowing plasma around the center of the torus. That is what the image shows. A plasmid can be created in a lab and similar jets are created. This match the observation. I thought Black Holes don&#39;t let out light...hence the term Black Hole. Anyway &quot;Wal Thornhil&quot; of the &quot;Thunderbolts Project&quot;  Youtube channel  explains it quit simply without having to use infinity in his mathematics. It is very important that scientists tell people that not all scientists agree with that theory. By not mentioning that fact, they always look like they are trying to silence opposition. In science especially we need to hear from as many minds and ideas as possible. Who know what the the real truth of the image, but lets try not to draw conclusions too quickly.

It stopped me short of putting my foot in the mouth and calling out the just released photo as humbug.

From outside, it would be light warping in all directions and maybe at best resemble a smouldering &#39;hollow&#39; sphere. And in another theory, light travels along the space time fabric that warps around the black-hole. It doesn&#39;t actually fall into the black hole. Matter falls into it because of the gravity, but light, which has no mass, continues along the medium it needs to propagate, in this case the space time fabric, and hence we see what is behind the black hole like the gravitational lensing phenomenon. So the just released photo could at best be a representation of the phenomenon of the black hole with some convenient selections and omissions done to make it understandable. I mean it would be difficult to show a ball of light and pass it off as a black hole, even though that might be how a black hole would look like to an observer from outside the event horizon.", "comment_date": "2019-04-15T09:29:55Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Legendary Six Samurai - Shi En", "comment_text": "Can some jump in and tell us what they see?

All males have an outward property, and all females have an inward property.  Its not quantum physics, but i accidentally stumbled upon this and share it freely.

There is no immediate profit to be made from the discovery. In fact, it could not have happened if these scientists had to justify their research on the basis of future commodities to be sold on the market, if they were beholden to private investors and quarterly earnings reports. It required social and public funding to liberate science from the boundaries/fetters of profit. Or it would not have happened. Nor could it have happened without profound international coordination (including with Russians and Chinese scientists!) <br><br>You see what I&#39;m getting at.<br><br>While we can take pictures of previously unseeable things, 55 million light years away, global capitalism can&#39;t figure out how to get all the abundance of food into the world&#39;s hungry bellies, all the homeless into the empty homes, and how to guarantee the conditions of existence as social rights. Because there&#39;s no profit to be made there -- quite the contrary. Our economies are bound by the profit motive and the systems of production, distribution, research and technology are controlled by corporations. So these massive social problems are widely considered natural, permanent, unsolvable. The UN declared them as Millennial Development Goals to be reached by 2015. All the countries signed up; they had celebrations and press conferences. But they failed to reach them. The people remained hungry. The rich got richer. All because of the boundaries of the profit system.<br><br>Albert Einstein, whose theory of general relativity led to the theory of black holes -- as the only way to resolve otherwise unresolvable physics problems \u2014 was also a socialist. He saw then, a full century ago, that there was more than enough for humanity to provide for the needs of the people if the economy were simply reorganized. A century later the black hole theory has entered into the world of reality, while his plain observation that we can have a world without hunger, homelessness and poverty remains &quot;theoretical.&quot; <br><br>That theory too can be made real. The scientists who made this breakthrough did so because they devoted their lives to it; it was not a passing interest that they focused on here and there. It will take a lot of dedication, hard work, trial, error and sacrifice to make our next, great collective &quot;breakthrough for humanity.&quot; No one needs an advanced degree to join.

The M87 and Sgr A* black holes are examples of low-accretion rate active galactic nuclei.  These are know as &quot;non-thermal AGNs&quot; because the energy output is dominate by mechanical energy in the radio jets.  The Event Horizon Telescope observes only radio waves and if there were a classical accretion disc around M87 it would not be emitting radio waves.  The description in the video of the light bending is good, but what is being bent is the RADIO emission.  The radio emission from around black holes is much more more poorly understood than the emission from classical accretion discs around high-accretion-rate AGNs.

I don&#39;t understand why light would behave differently around a black hole that doesn&#39;t have matter flying around it vs. one that does. Does he mean that the light we see is actually coming from the ecretion disc?<br>- Okay maybe this one will truly show my ignorance: If light has no mass, how can it be affected by the gravity of the black hole at all? It can obviously get a lot closer than the gas of the ecretion disk, but why does it get affected at all, if it has no mass?<br>- He&#39;s trying to make a point at <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUyH3XhpLTo&amp;t=5m38s\">5:38</a> but I just don&#39;t see the connection.

In special relativity, the Lorentz factor (and therefore time dilation) is asymptotic as the velocity of a particle or system approaches the speed of light (one second to something traveling 99% the speed of light would be 7 seconds to us, and if it&#39;s going at 99.9% the speed of light, one of its seconds would be 21 seconds of ours or something like that, and the number just keeps shooting up). So to a photon&#39;s perspective, the moment it&#39;s created and the moment it hits matter light years away is the exact same instant.  If gravitational time dilaton works in the same manner approaching the event horizon of a black hole, would that matter not experience the same thing?  I&#39;ve heard that this is the case, but then comes what I feel is the logical extension of this, which confuses me - suppose I could somehow reach the event horizon and still be alive.  I would never experience crossing the event horizon, because to be at that same distance from the center, one of my seconds would be an &quot;infinite&quot; number of seconds - as in way more than enough time for the black hole to radiate away a bit (I mean, it would be enough time to immediately witness the universe reaching a point where time has no meaning if it were truly <i>infinite</i> ).  So theoretically, to my perspective (in my interpretation, at least), would I not essentially just be approaching, but never reaching, the event horizon as it recedes and recedes until the black hole has fully radiated away?  To say I reach a point in space where, even for a <i>billionth</i> of a second, the passage of time is infinitely fast, means that the exact moment I reach it, any inconceivable amount of time passes in less than the blink of an eye. &quot;Infinite&quot; is <i>infinite</i> ... it wouldn&#39;t matter how momentary my stay is there, it could be a Planck time, I would conceivably watch the effective &quot;end&quot; of the universe and beyond if I looked behind me and if black holes didn&#39;t actually ever radiate away.  I mean, I get that black holes actually do absorb matter in reality, but what makes up for this discrepancy?  Is this just a misinterpretation of mine?  Wouldn&#39;t it be impossible for me to actually reach and cross the event horizon in a finite amount of time? Is that why it&#39;s said that the entropy of a black hole is its surface area, because information can&#39;t really get past the surface?", "comment_date": "2019-04-11T07:01:49Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Julien Ribollet", "comment_text": "so cool thx Derek", "comment_date": "2019-04-11T07:00:49Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Devashish Vashistha", "comment_text": "You said the hole is much hotter on the round surface but i don&#39;t think that .", "comment_date": "2019-04-11T06:59:54Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "AMIT KUMAR", "comment_text": "in india,,,, people are with busy,, whether nodi will or not.. it sucks..... science rocks..... physics rocks", "comment_date": "2019-04-11T06:59:37Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "\ua9c1\u0f12Duchi\u0f12\ua9c2", "comment_text": "<b>My recommendations</b><br>Are now bombarded with Black Hole videos", "comment_date": "2019-04-11T06:58:13Z", "likes_count": 426}, {"comment_by": "DW", "comment_text": "<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUyH3XhpLTo&amp;t=3m12s\">3:12</a> i can finally give myself a haircut", "comment_date": "2019-04-11T06:57:23Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "littlegoobie", "comment_text": "<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUyH3XhpLTo&amp;t=0m15s\">0:15</a>   I can tell you for a fact that the black hole looks nothing like that.

If these so called &quot;scientist&quot; understood how to connect their math to real physical material maybe they would finally understand what a black hole really is. Using the mathematical constant Pi that tells us that there can be no smallest or largest ratio of a circles circumference to its diameter therefore when it comes to the shape of all objects, there can be no smallest point any physical material can reach. With this understanding on size/shapes/ and dimensions I conclude that a black is not a stable size object but a object that is so heavy it constantly crush&#39;s itself into a smaller and smaller size unable to reach a smallest point and this constant shrinking is happening at a rate the exceeds light speed so as a black hole object gets smaller its gravity pulls the light rays into it and the speed in witch the black hole is shrinking keeps the light rays from advancing out of the orbit of the black hole.

But...... if the black hole is sucking in energy from all angles, would we not see just a bright light because the matter that is being sucked in would form almost a shield of stars and heating up matter from every and all angles? Also do black holes have a north and south pole(edit: relatively of course)? That would make a disc around them like Saturn but can anyone really confirm that? Or is it the way that we observes these phenomenon that we can not see this part? Also, &quot;it gets sucked in&quot; . I understand the the light will bend around it just like how a satellite is launched, or if you want to slingshot around the moon and come back to earth. You take advantage of the gravity to get where you want to be. BUT if a black hole is sucking up the galaxy then why would it not be surrounded by everything going over under and above like you explained. PLUS the stuff that is close enough to it to begin its journey of being sucked in, that is much closer to us and more visible, WHILE not being sucked into the core.... How would that not block the view of what we are looking at. From what i gathered so far, essentially the Black hole has the same properties of a planet, but times A LOT and i am uncertain and wonder if a black hole would have 2 poles or it just in itself is a 360 degree pole that sucks up everything. Which, if true, you get too close and prepare for impact,. SO long story short why would a black hole not just look like an over sized star through a telescope?

Always ahead of the curve.<br>I have an idea that can lead to something beautiful, but you need to give me 5 minutes to read this comment. Thanks<br> I am a VFX artist and I worked at the company that made the VFX for Interstellar many years ago. Double Negative.<br>Paul Franklin ( <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/paul.franklin1\">https://www.facebook.com/paul.franklin1</a> ) was the visual effects Supervisor for the movie, and the creative director of the company, and he was my boss there .I worked for him years before they won the Oscar for that movie.<br><br>Back then they created a special render engine that can calculate the bending of light around black holes, using the equations provided by  Kip Thorne. As you ight know, is the engine with which they  created the iconic BH images of the film.<br><br>I suggested to Paul, half joking, via Facebook, that they at Dneg could re ignite that render engine to create a new image of the recently discovered black hole, but, obviously, nicer and at a much higher resolution. As the new black  is different, they would need to do a new image to better match the features of the new BH, but with both scientific accurary and artistic sense . I think it would be a beautifult idea, that I would need you to join the cause and make them excited about it, so they put some time and effort on it? <br>what do you think?

All the gravity is pointing outwards not inwards, the gradient is unbelievably intense and the time dilation effects of Einsteinian curvature mean that even basic physics becomes diffracted.    There have been series of photographs before showing stars moving around unpredictably near the center of galaxies and there is already a supermassive structure in effect at those locations - the galaxy itself.<br><br>Second problem is that the moment you apply a force too strong for light to escape you have also created something that cannot itself move forward in time.   Again Einstein wins and at best you can say &quot;something such-n-so used to be there&quot; but the object literally stops moving in spacetime the moment it happens.<br><br>Third and most simple, if we&#39;re looking directly at the core of a central galaxy jet of matter and particles, the actual center part is - axially - not going to be visible to optical equipment at any wavelength but WILL be physically there blocking and disrupting all energies that ARE detectable in that specific region... its like trying to see a fire from directly above through it&#39;s plume of black smoke - you simply cannot see the flames through the cloud.<br><br>So the picture they show is 100% confirmation bias without any science to back it up and NO attempt to validate.<br><br>Not to mention you can&#39;t have black holes in a big-bang universe for the simple reason that they instantly cease to exist if they try to form or the universe never began at all.<br><br>So we&#39;re looking at a hole... in the middle of a giant supermassive object which has a hole in the middle of it.    The galaxy itself is sufficient to explain the image... and isn&#39;t going to tolerate a small massive gravitational source trying to occupy the locus of it&#39;s own inverse event horizon (the area in which all gravity is pulling outwards... we have one in Earth that follows the moon around the mathematical center of the planet kneeding the core and generating heat).", "comment_date": "2019-04-10T17:17:55Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Dielan9999", "comment_text": "UMMMMM.....

What this means is, it&#39;s a reflection and a refraction, at the same time, and neither, at the same time. It&#39;s a simultaneous contradiction and agreement, because our observations support both arguments equally. That happens in mathematics all the time... since the universe, when you break it down to it&#39;s core properties... is simply an equation that has no perceivable end to it. Think about (10 -(pi)) + (pi)) ... does that logic equal 10? Or does it produce an endless 9.9? It&#39;s a supertask. It&#39;s an infinite hall of mirrors. It&#39;s easy for me to see that it&#39;s also represented as the yin and the yang. One side is god, the other is the devil, and they wage an endless war that can never be resolved. It happens intrinsically, and externally, infinitely outward, and infinitely inward.<br><br>I would like for you to see the superpositional language I&#39;m about to use here.<br>Is a black hole really there? Well every argument suggests that it might be. What if it isn&#39;t? well, it must be, it can&#39;t not exist, right? What if it&#39;s both, there, and not there, at the same time? Sounds like a contradiction. What if it&#39;s neither, there or elsewhere. Sounds like Another contradiction. But that&#39;s exactly the nature of the question you&#39;re asking.<br><br>Is light both a particle and a wave? Well, when we observe the photons going through the slit, we see that it goes against our observations. When we are not observing, it goes one way or another. When we both observe something, we see different sides of an equation, as perspectives. When we observe nothing... we allow it to choose for us.<br><br>That&#39;s the nature of superposition and entanglement. Something tells me you&#39;re like a dog chasing it&#39;s tail, trying to find the answer, and though you might find yourself becoming increasingly more educated over time... fact of the matter is, you could spend an eternity trying to figure it out, and still never have the answer you&#39;re looking for... unless you consider that a paradox and an equation are the same thing.<br><br>Hope that &#39;sheds some light&#39; onto the subject for you Derek.

I&#39;d expect some thermal UV radiation, radiation from occasional collisions, mass differentiation of infalling / orbiting material adding structure to the disc etc... What causes the radio emissions?<br>(2) Materials that are nudged from the accretion disc enter unstable orbits, and so should be scattered in all directions. Will this not create some back-reaction onto the accretion disc itself, as scattered particles collide into those of the accretion disc?<br>(3) Further on particles that have unstable orbits, wouldn&#39;t there be violent collisions in this region? Could that not generate some particle creation (and further decay) leading to radiation in escape trajectories in a sphere around the BH? In the simplest case that would result in the entire BH being shrouded in by a shell of light (although due to the mechanism of its production I wouldn&#39;t expect it to be very bright - the wavelength of this emission would also matter).<br>(4) What are the possible stable geometries of accretion discs?<br>EDIT<br>(5) Will it ever be possible to observe a stellar ocultation by the SMBH (or even any other stellar BH) - if yes that would be exciting!

But normally it passes through objects, deforming them but not pushing them. But if time simmetry is right, if i reverse time, a group of gravitational waves collapsing into a spinning system in the right way should speed up its rotation. So only certain objects are able to absorb a gravitational wave with its momentum and then reflect it. Just like only certain atoms can absorb and reflect certain frequencies of light. Metals can reflect most of the light becouse all the active electrons live in a quantum sea that can eat all of the frequencies, so maybe there is something in space that can do the same with gravitational waves and it may be tied with dark matter or energy?<br>Also, if gravitational waves are bent by gravity itself, if i radiate a wave into a system that can absorb it, could the gravity of that system make it seem like the gravitational wave acted just like a big graviton? So basically half of it is completely absorbed just like an electron can absorb half of a photon entagled pair, so one photon, even tho it should be just a wave? Could gravitational waves help us understanding quantum mechanics using the macro world?<br>Vsauce music starts<br>Basically, can a photon be just a wave (like anything else) that when it starts interacting with something like one electron, it does in a way that all its energy is absorbed by that electron so that it&#39;s like if it was a particle all along? Maybe like a grav wave can be absorbed not only directly but also by being pulled by the gravity of the object? Maybe there is some maths that says that when the wave of an electron &quot;starts&quot; absorbing the wave of a photon, they combine togheter in a mixture of both, with the entire photon wave being entagled with the electron wave without having to collapse into a particle, and looses the ability to exite other electrons, and then after some time the two waves separate again but this time the photon wave has changed directions and starts again from a point (general area becouse of the wavelenght). Maybe an exited electron doesn&#39;t just teleport up and down but his &quot;position&quot; is in reality defined by both his original wave combined with the photon wave coming from far, so it doesn&#39;t find himself in a different orbital magically, but rather it became something that exist in that higher orbital only becouse the photon was already there, so instead of saying &quot;oh the electron just popped there becouse we collapsed his wave function&quot; we say &quot;the electron-photon pair has its centre of max amplitude (becouse now we consider them just waves) in this orbital&quot; and when they separate its centre of amplitude immediatly shifts back to the original position without actually having to travel.<br>The electron wave never moves, rather the electron becomes one with the photon, changes its proprieties for a bit, and then the photon leaves again without anyone having to collapse.<br>The electron is actually all the orbital fluctuating, but when we try to see where it is, we just see the photon coming out of it in a certain area, becouse that&#39;s where it got separated from the wavy blob.<br>Not sure how this connects with bell&#39;s inequality and the entaglement, that&#39;s still a mistery and it may be one way to prove this wrong, even tho someone into the subject probably can do that in one minute<br> Someone at university, here you have your next article if you can check that i&#39;m not completely wrong.<br>I would do it myself but i&#39;m stuck with the exams and could definetly not do the calculations at all.", "comment_date": "2019-04-09T20:46:16Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Jazz", "comment_text": "Are you going to livestream the event?", "comment_date": "2019-04-09T20:45:58Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "kiwi", "comment_text": "Light has no mass so lets change something to make this possible ... people who are intelligent, would know that light is a Form of mass itself .. instead of think about the universe, they should know First Everything about us and our Planet", "comment_date": "2019-04-09T20:45:55Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "The Hurricane", "comment_text": "This is like listening to someone explain jesus, or buddha.

One comment is (as dramatically pointed out in the movie  Interstellar and Kip Thorne&#39;s book) as the gravity of black holes warps the space-time, objects closer to the black hole experience time at a different pace than object far away.

But I have a couple of questions. You mention early in the video that light has no mass, and that that is why the accretion disk exists.<br>But if light has no mass, then why would the gravity of the black hole have any effect whatsoever?<br>And if light has no mass, why would it bend when it passes near anything that has mass, and particularly when it passes over a black hole.<br>In fact, if light has no mass, why can not even light captured by a black hole be stuck in it?<br>And if a black hole can capture something with no mass, and keep it forever, then there must be some &quot;force&quot; - let&#39;s call it gravity - that must be so powerful, that it prevents even the escape of light. So, if that force is so powerful - even at the event horizon - wouldn&#39;t it get stronger as whatever it has captured gets closer to its center? And if it gets stronger, stronger, why, then wouldn&#39;t any light it has captured &quot;speed-up&quot; as it gets closer to the center? And wouldn&#39;t that mean that light that has been captured by a black hole, and is headed towards its center, be moving faster than light that that has just entered the event horizon?<br>Isn&#39;t the speed of light a constant?<br>And, if the speed of of light is a constant - commonly expressed (oddly enough) in miles-pre-second, and if shortest distance between two points is space is a straight line, and light &quot;bends&quot; when it passes a massive object, then the light that didn&#39;t have to bend will reach a particular point in space sooner than light that had to &quot;bend&quot; on its journey to that particular point in space.<br>And doesn&#39;t that mean that the light that had to bend must reach that particular point in space LATER than the light that didn&#39;t have to bend. Right?<br>But then my question is: If light has no mass, why would it bend at all? Why wouldn&#39;t light that &quot;hits&quot; a massive object simply be reflected in a direction Away from that object, and light that does not hit it can then continue on its merry way?<br>That was my first question.<br>The second is: Why is whatever composes the &quot;accretion disk&quot; a disk at all?<br>Why wouldn&#39;t stuff that has not yet reached the event horizon described as a forming a disk rather than being described as a sphere that completely surrounds the black hole just beyond the event horizon?<br>If it is, in actuality, a disk, how thich is the disk? How wide?

If you were to cross the event horizon, would you see a sudden flash of light? My thinking is that as matter falls into the black hole some of the light would be emitted directly perpendicular to the center at just the right time to effectively become &#39;stuck&#39; on the event horizon, perpetually trying to escape. In which case, all the matter which has previously fallen in would create a layer of light which one could conceivably pass and observe.<br><br>2. If you were to look outwards from a black hole after falling in, again, would you see a sudden flash of light? My thinking this time is that since time passes slower the closer one is to the center of a black hole, looking outwards the universe will appear to progressively speed up. In which case, the universe is emitting more light per second relative to your time. So the intensity of the light will increase the closer you get to the singularity as all the additional light from the sped up universe enters the black hole and catches up to your position, no?<br><br>Thanks, and keep up the great content! :)", "comment_date": "2019-04-09T13:59:16Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Srivatsan P B", "comment_text": "Space science is as always awesome", "comment_date": "2019-04-09T13:59:15Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Chase Braley", "comment_text": "Is it the black hole thats spinning or the objects in orbit around the black hole?", "comment_date": "2019-04-09T13:59:14Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Junior Balls", "comment_text": "I hope tomorrow will be epic", "comment_date": "2019-04-09T13:58:58Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Bung Magoo", "comment_text": "Why is it called a hole if it\u2019s actually a sphere?", "comment_date": "2019-04-09T13:58:46Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Alexander Colefield", "comment_text": "As cool as confirmation would be, disinformation would be even wilder, imagine if the black hole ended up looking like something completely different, Hexagon on Saturn style.", "comment_date": "2019-04-09T13:58:45Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "scubadrew9292", "comment_text": "\u00af\\_(\u30c4)_/\u00af", "comment_date": "2019-04-09T13:58:32Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "deadsoulvamp", "comment_text": "What is the density of a blackhole?
