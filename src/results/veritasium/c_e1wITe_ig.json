Whoever built the pyramid (most likely not the egyptians) had incredible knowledge aqnd almost as much of an interest in fixing these units of measure as you guys at Veritasium. I was sceptical at first but having invested some time getting up to speed on recent discoveriies now apparent due to greater accuracy of modern instrumentation I am amazed at the sheer number of Coincidences. We are vtaught at school that the egyptian unit of measure was the Cubit! It is interesting then that the circumference of a circle with a diameter of 1 meter is 2.54 meteres and that the Cubit is one tenth of that. 25.4cm. Also interesting that the inch is 2.54 cm! and it goes on and on. <br>One last observation. Is it possible that the slight variation in the earths speed of rotation, and thus the force of gravity, was responsible for the changes in the weight of the Kilogramme over time. for sure, theres more to this that is yet to be revealed. Maybe fixing the constants might ber the answer but maybe not. Great question though, and very well drilled into.

Time spent at work, money earned per hour, cost per minute, value on said time. I mean, whose idea was it that we would even have time based value? Someone made up numbers, someone made up seconds, minutes, hours, days, weeks, months and years and than somehow it was decided that there would be value placed against that time? Rent, mortgage, electricity, gas,. We as humans decided it was best to measure value of other humans against time, but why? Why are we the only species in known existence that does this?<br><br>With said changes in this video it is now easier for everything to standardise <b>cough*America*cough</b> everything. But it can also be said to be used as a way to ensure monetary value remains constant and does not fluctuate between the international measurements, it is both a good and bad thing.<br><br>It is all an artificial system we made up that we also joke about that one day may come to an abrupt end and the downfall of current civilisation. Take a look at crypto currencies, there is nothing behind it that is actually worth money, we do not have a gold standard that can be traded, it is nothing more than a number on a screen someone made up and allotted a value against. What happens when we realise the stock market are just numbers on a screen used by the rich to control the poor? May pay has no value behind it, I am not getting a piece of gold each week that can be traded to someone for good or services.<br><br>I just hope on day we can move to a system that works for everyone, something that will push humanity to a greater civilisation that does not rely on money.", "comment_date": "2019-01-04T11:21:09Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Gotenks - Starboy", "comment_text": "Omg he got fat", "comment_date": "2019-01-03T22:49:38Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Schattengew\u00e4chs", "comment_text": "I think you can\u2018t compare science to art.<br><br>Science is about understanding the things outside of us.

It was pointed out as I understood that the ultimate achievement of human kind  is their ability to derive an ultimate form of order, quantifiable purely into numbers beyond the physical and tangible, and beyond chaos itself. I believe that this is a proper and sufficient way of assessment of how much human beings have achieved, but rather in a uni dimensional way. Humans have a hidden duality that interchangeable chases order and chaos and that is a quality that stems out of the realization of what we are in the universe, and finding our mortality grounding us in an existential way. That in turn makes us search for ways to immortalize ourselves as a species. Here however there is the question of how that&#39;s done. Some people look from the microscopic to the macroscopic in search of absolute truth, and others look within their own nature. Both searches need to be done eternally in order understand both chaos and order better. One may even argue that  the human race must have a far more advanced culture before going any further with technology.

Is that correct so far?<br>Now, what I am hearing is that in order to escape being shackled to the prototype kilo, which I gather might be measured very slightly differently in different locations in space and time (given that of it and its cousins are actually moving with respect to each other), we are <b>assigning</b> a value to Planck&#39;s Constant--our best estimation of what it truly is--and figuring all of our observations from <b>that.</b> What I am finding challenging here is this: Doesn&#39;t that mean that there is a possibility that the number they picked does <b>not</b> accurately express that very precise aspect of the universe?

Somewhere down the line the metrologists will adopt the new value and change the conversion, not the unit value.  An example: when the metric units were invented, the meter was set to 1/10,000,000 the distance from the north pole to the equator, and that meter was inscribed on a metal bar. Later on that distance was refined, and as a result, the value is now 1/10,000,001.965.  Geographers didn&#39;t slavishly use the metrologist&#39;s length; when a new length for pole-to-equator was determined, they used that.  The metrologists didn&#39;t change the meter, either.

That is actually worse, lol. Science is about the understanding of the universe, Art is about the understanding of the human condition and life. So what if we know how everything around us work and have no idea about ourselves. When all is said and done, what really matters? I&#39;d say an artist that inspires with his work, changes the perspective of life, leads a generation of people to find their way and motivates them, is far more important than lets say an order of magnitude enchancement on the accuracy of our instruments. Besides, what is the thing that fuels scientific research anyways (lets not talk about the reason being making more money)? It is, apart from the satisfaction of our burning curiosity about our universe, the desire to diminish the human suffering, the desire to improve life and make the world a better place for us humans. And guess what that is? That&#39;s right, its an EMOTIONAL condition. Science and Technology by themselves are mindless. They are like a high tech ship. They can get us to very far places fast and safely, according to specification. But without the proper driver controlling the direction and the purpose, it can go around circles or crash and sink. And that is where our ship is currently heading. In a few years the damage we have done to the environment will be irreversible. Will scientific knowledge matter then? On the brink of destruction, if science hasn&#39;t managed to save us from ourselves, then what&#39;s the point? We need more smart and better educated people, but far more than that we need people that want to make the world a better place.

I know you didn&#39;t mean to disparage those &#39;other disciplines&#39;, though I&#39;d like to encourage you to consider this one fact - those other disciplines, being in their exact nature fundamentally unquantifiable, have progressed in their own ways, and have also contributed somewhat invisibly to human existance.<br><br>Consider for a moment, that there are many indicators that could be used to quantify the progress of science - Precision of measurements for instance, or repeatability of experiments. And science has been a cornerstone of the achievements of any particular society. However, in comparison, for the arts, for the social sciences, there are no reliable indicators which could be used to quantify any such achievements. Take governance for instance - there&#39;s almost nothing you can use to quantify or compare that a democracy is better than a socialist/communist government. Or that either would be better than a monarchy. Yet at the same time we&#39;re quite certain that one is better than the other, just not in quantifiable ways.<br><br>The arts and literature have evolved, each leap providing more enriching insights into the nature of our humanity, verily answering and questioning things that are so core and central to our own personal identities or how we ought to live and conduct ourselves.<br><br>The contributions of such disciplines are so fundamental, and yet so unquantifiable. It&#39;s impossible to tell with scientific certainty which is better than which, and I&#39;d argue from a standpoint of pure logic that any fair comparison is impossible to make.<br><br>Again, while I know you didn&#39;t mean to put down other disciplines, and while you really meant to express your excitement over this milestone of human achievement, I don&#39;t think this was any bit a fair comment. After all, Science and Philosophy once shared the same cradle - Socrates himself was once lumped together with the presocratics, people one might consider to be early proto-scientists; and this was an association that Socrates himself seemed desperate to tear apart or distance himself from.", "comment_date": "2018-11-16T09:18:22Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "adib agus", "comment_text": "thank goodness i just finished high school.

The seed number they use was covertly based on the coordinates of the greatest measuring tool of all time, the Great Pyramid.  The Great Pyramid was based on Orion&#39;s belt.

Now that is a nice statement...\u00a0Are &quot;ideas&quot; tied to physical objects? Well, yes, they are (our brains are physical objects). Nevertheless a very nice video. If science thought us something, it is that there will always be change. I imagine that in a rudimentary time interval T, some other entity, being Derek-like, will make some similar video with similar statements, when it will be about correcting the defined value, because new knowledge and WISDOM about the universe.... Maybe there are no constants at all, the only constant is that everything changes. And the universe will not die a heat death, rather the laws will slowly, much slower than we could observe, change and adapt. I apologize for this esotherical BS, I do not think it either, but I must leave a tiny amount of probability, that it might be true... Lucky for me, it could not be proven or disproven in my lifetime or the lifetime of our Sun.... The amount of wisdom is proportional to the grey hairs on Dereks face. I am really happy for him to still radiate the same amount of positivity in his videos, to still shine and be like a kid when it comes to fundamental things. Being the bad guy now: I think we just deceive ourselvs by setting some constants to an exact number, neglecting our ignornance. Yes, maybe we can define EXACT things, but since nature is fundamentally impossible to be EXACT (quantum mechnics), the thing we create is just a lie. Nonetheless, a very useful one. If there is one thing in the world I would enjoy, it is a beer with Derek, talking about... Anything... Whatever he has on his mind....
