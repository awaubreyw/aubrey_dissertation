Everyone is arguing over the inclusion of air resistance and how that effects which ball lands first, and there is A LOT of incorrect argumentation that&#39;s really rustling my jimmies. I&#39;m a senior in engineering at Cornell University and let me set some facts straight. <br><br>Firstly, I want to emphasis that the point of this video is to demonstrate as Galileo did that gravitational force is proportional to mass, and therefore gravitational acceleration has no dependence on mass when working with the right conditions. Comments arguing over the inclusion of air resistance is seriously tangential and distracting from the point of the video. Now just this once, let me contradict myself. <br><br>With the conditions we are working with, with the problem that we have set up, there is no way that air resistance would make any discernable difference to a human being. The drag force is tiny in comparison to the gravitational force, and the change in landing time is dwarfed anyway by the error of letting go of the balls synchronously and with no initial velocity. Even if you were to drop the balls from on top of a tower as Galileo supposedly did, the change in landing time would still not be discernable. <br><br>Now, I do want to state that heavy objects will technically be able to shrug off air resistance better than light objects and therefore fall faster. The drag coefficient is determined by the surface area and shape of the ball, and if we assume the drag is viscous, is also proportional to the square of the velocity of the object, meaning that the equation of motion is the solution of my&#39;&#39;(t) - a(y&#39;(t))^2 + mg = 0. The short explanation is this: the reason why they land at the same time without air resistance is because the black ball has x times the force on it, but is also x times heavier to move: mg = ma. The drag on both balls moving at the same speed will be the same, because it&#39;s determined by the speed of the balls, the geometry/area of the balls (the same), and the medium the balls are in (the same). Since the heavier ball has more force, it will lose less of its force-to-mass ratio than the lighter ball does, and so it will accelerate faster. There was someone arguing in the comments that the slower ball would experience less drag, and that this would cancel out - this is markedly not true. The ball isn&#39;t going to magically catch up once it&#39;s already behind. This is very easy to show mathematically. <br><br>One more time, I want to emphasis that this is really besides the point of the video. I think this is evoking a reaction in people because they find it very intuitive for heavier objects to fall faster and they have to justify this through the drag argument in a situation where it doesn&#39;t apply. Did you know that the ball that moves closer to the camera actually has an unfair advantage in comparison to the ball that moves away from the camera, because it takes less time to travel from the close ball than from the far ball and therefore events from the first ball are registered first? We don&#39;t care about relativistic effects here not because they don&#39;t exist, but because we&#39;re in a domain where it doesn&#39;t apply. For air resistance, it&#39;s the same story.", "comment_date": "2020-10-10T03:50:26Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Angel Obeso", "comment_text": "see but if they both reach their terminal velocity that\u2019s a different story", "comment_date": "2020-10-06T20:21:42Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Abhishek Gupta", "comment_text": "you&#39;ve not taken into consideration the effect of drag force on balls. although it&#39;ll be small, but still to be accurate the heavier ball will reach the ground first by few mllisec", "comment_date": "2020-10-05T09:10:21Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "galanoth17", "comment_text": "<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oBdalzRJR5g&amp;t=1m29s\">1:29</a> shot from Messi.

The full can was the first to reach the floor by a clear intervall.  And it bursts completely.  The empty can had no scratches. <br><br>For better understanding it helped my friend to imagine two sinking balls in honey-like fluid, one very heavy weighted and one distinctly lighter. But it was a real hard concept changing process for him.<br> <br>The heavier ball reaches a higher sinking velocity in the end (as one of the girls in the video said). Both balls with clearly different gravity forces accelerate until air friction compensates these different forces (so the heavier ball gets more time of acceleration until compensation.
