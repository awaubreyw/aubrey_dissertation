", "comment_text": "&quot;Some bacteria cultured in a laboratory have gained the ability to use citrate as an energy source. We have had lots of queries about this matter, so this is our weekend feedback to all those who have asked.\r<br>\r<br>A New Scientist article proclaims:\r<br>\r<br>\u2018Lenski\u2019s experiment is also yet another poke in the eye for anti-evolutionists, notes Jerry Coyne, an evolutionary biologist at the University of Chicago. \u201cThe thing I like most is it says you can get these complex traits evolving by a combination of unlikely events,\u201d he says. \u201cThat\u2019s just what creationists say can\u2019t happen.\u201d\u20191\r<br>\r<br>The many comments posted on the New Scientist website shows just how excited the atheists are about this report. They are positively gloating.\r<br>\r<br>The context\r<br>In 1988, Richard Lenski, Michigan State University, East Lansing, founded 12 cultures of E. coli and grew them in a laboratory, generation after generation, for twenty years (he deserves some marks for persistence!). The culture medium had a little glucose but lots more citrate, so once the microbes consumed the glucose, they would continue to grow only if they could evolve some way of using citrate. Lenski expected to see evolution in action. This was an appropriate expectation for one who believes in evolution, because bacteria reproduce quickly and can have huge populations, as in this case. They can also sustain higher mutation rates than organisms with much larger genomes, like vertebrates such as us.2 All of this adds up, according to neo-Darwinism, to the almost certainty of seeing lots of evolution happen in real time (instead of imagining it all happening in the unobservable past). With the short generation times, in 20 years this has amounted to some 44,000 generations, equivalent to some million years of generations of a human population (but the evolutionary opportunities for humans would be far, far less, due to the small population numbers limiting the number of mutational possibilities; and the much larger genome, which cannot sustain a similar mutation rate without error catastrophe; i.e. extinction; and sexual reproduction means that there is 50% chance of failing to pass on a beneficial mutation ).\r<br>\r<br>As noted elsewhere (see \u2018Giving up on reality\u2019), Lenski seemed to have given up on \u2018evolution in the lab\u2019 and resorted to computer modelling of \u2018evolution\u2019 with a program called Avida (see evaluation by Dr Royal Truman, Part 1 and Part 2, which are technical papers). Indeed, Lenski had good reason to abandon hope. He had calculated1 that all possible simple mutations must have occurred several times over but without any addition of even a simple adaptive trait.\r<br>\r<br>Lenski and co-workers now claim that they have finally observed his hoped for evolution in the lab.\r<br>\r<br>The science: what did they find?\r<br>In a paper published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Science, Lenski and co-workers describe how one of 12 culture lines of their bacteria has developed the capacity for metabolizing citrate as an energy source under aerobic conditions.3\r<br>\r<br>This happened by the 31,500th generation. Using frozen samples of bacteria from previous generations they showed that something happened at about the 20,000th generation that paved the way for only this culture line to be able to change to citrate metabolism. They surmised, quite reasonably, that this could have been a mutation that paved the way for a further mutation that enabled citrate utilization.\r<br>\r<br>This is close to what Michael Behe calls \u2018The Edge of Evolution\u2019\u2014the limit of what \u2018evolution\u2019 (non-intelligent natural processes) can do. For example, an adaptive change needing one mutation might occur every so often just by chance. This is why the malaria parasite can adapt to most antimalarial drugs; but chloroquine resistance took much longer to develop because two specific mutations needed to occur together in the one gene. Even this tiny change is beyond the reach of organisms like humans with much longer generation times.4 With bacteria, there might be a chance for even three coordinated mutations, but it\u2019s doubtful that Lenski\u2019s E. coli have achieved any more than two mutations, so have not even reached Behe\u2019s edge, let alone progressed on the path to elephants or crocodiles.\r<br>\r<br>Now the popularist treatments of this research (e.g. in New Scientist) give the impression that the E. coli developed the ability to metabolize citrate, whereas it supposedly could not do so before. However, this is clearly not the case, because the citric acid, tricarboxcylic acid (TCA), or Krebs, cycle (all names for the same thing) generates and utilizes citrate in its normal oxidative metabolism of glucose and other carbohydrates.5\r<br>\r<br>Furthermore, E. coli is normally capable of utilizing citrate as an energy source under anaerobic conditions, with a whole suite of genes involved in its fermentation. This includes a citrate transporter gene that codes for a transporter protein embedded in the cell wall that takes citrate into the cell.6 This suite of genes (operon) is normally only activated under anaerobic conditions.\r<br>\r<br>this would be the sort of thing that mutations are good at: destroying things\r<br>So what happened? It is not yet clear from the published information, but a likely scenario is that mutations jammed the regulation of this operon so that the bacteria produce citrate transporter regardless of the oxidative state of the bacterium\u2019s environment (that is, it is permanently switched on). This can be likened to having a light that switches on when the sun goes down\u2014a sensor detects the lack of light and turns the light on. A fault in the sensor could result in the light being on all the time. That is the sort of change we are talking about.\r<br>\r<br>it has no relevance to the origin of enzymes and catalytic pathways that evolution is supposed to explain\r<br>Another possibility is that an existing transporter gene, such as the one that normally takes up tartrate,3 which does not normally transport citrate, mutated such that it lost specificity and could then transport citrate into the cell. Such a loss of specificity is also an expected outcome of random mutations. A loss of specificity equals a loss of information, but evolution is supposed to account for the creation of new information; information that specifies the enzymes and cofactors in new biochemical pathways, how to make feathers and bone, nerves, or the components and assembly of complex motors such as ATP synthase, for example.\r<br>\r<br>However, mutations are good at destroying things, not creating them. Sometimes destroying things can be helpful (adaptive),7 but that does not account for the creation of the staggering amount of information in the DNA of all living things. Behe (in The Edge of Evolution) likened the role of mutations in antibiotic resistance and pathogen resistance, for example, to trench warfare, whereby mutations destroy some of the functionality of the target or host to overcome susceptibility. It\u2019s like putting chewing gum in a mechanical watch; it\u2019s not the way the watch could have been created.\r<br>\r<br>Much ado about nothing (again)\r<br>Behe is quite right; there is nothing here that is beyond \u2018the edge of evolution\u2019, which means it has no relevance to the origin of enzymes and catalytic pathways that evolution is supposed to explain.8\r<br>\r<br>Addendum (prepared March 2016)\r<br>Further research on the citrate-digesting bacteria has elucidated much of the biochemical mechanism for the ability of the bacteria to utilize citrate in the presence of oxygen, rather than only in the absence of oxygen.1&quot;", "comment_date": "2022-06-12T07:28:43Z", "likes_count": 3}, {"comment_by": "PhanTasticGame", "comment_text": "does this bacteria generation follow the bifurcation model? i wonder .. you see those same looking shapes", "comment_date": "2022-06-12T02:52:06Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Brendan Toscano", "comment_text": "3 decades is what i call commitment", "comment_date": "2022-06-11T23:33:38Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Michael Johnson", "comment_text": "This is natural selection, not evolution.

It can be accelerated by events and co-evolution, but it will happen all the time regardless, just by chance. But there seem to be a lot of people put there who can&#39;t or won&#39;t understand that more or less mathematical part of evolution. I had a discussion in a reddit grou about closed natural ecospheres and that there are some out there which lasted for several decades as of now. And one user wondered if evolution in a closed jar, just getting light as an energy source from the outside will be possible. And for some reason there where two diffrent train of thoughts present within the commentors. One that was unsure, but liked to play with the idea that life in those jars would be able to evolve and adapt. And the other - for some reason bigger - group that absolutly dismissed this idea, as there would be no way of mutating (because there aren&#39;t any mutagens or competition happening). But competition doesn&#39;t mean predation and they totally forgot that mutation don&#39;t necessarily need mutagens, just chance to happen. So there would be no reason not to think that all this algae and bacteria and coepods would not evolve. Sure, they would not start a civilization.

The earth also and the works that are in it will be burned up. 2 Peter 3:10 MEV</i>\r<br>(Obs: The destructions that will happen after the rapture, just as the days of Sodom and Gomorrah; the righteous are rescued and the judgements are poured upon the wicked. &quot;like a thief in the night&quot; means it will happen when you do not expect. &quot;heavens will pass away&quot; means the sky will vanish as a scroll that is being rolled up, which is mentioned in Revelation 6:14.)\r<br>\r<br><i>In a moment, in the twinkling of an eye, at the last trumpet, for the trumpet will sound, the dead will be raised incorruptible, and we shall be changed. 1 Corinthians 15:52 MEV</i>\r<br>(Obs: People around the world have been hearing trumpets from the sky in different times, it has been happening for a few years.

This diversification is part of the protection already planned in the genome of the bacteria. There is no mutation. Why this is not taught in school?

So creationism has a new life and without god or mysticism. In the Universe, a kind of natural selection of the life propagation processes is at play.

I am not sure it proves evolution. The experiment does cause change. The bacteria are fitter for life in a test tube and are better at consuming their food. But after 75,000 generations they are still bacteria and have not become anything else. I have heard that this experiment makes bacteria fitter for life in the lab but they have lost the ability to move. Outside the lab they would die. I don&#39;t know if that is correct but they certainly have not become anything else but bacteria over 75,000 generations. Experiments on fruit flies produce fruit flies. The fossil record has no chain of evolution from bacteria to trilobites. Trilobites appear suddenly in the lower Cambrian layer some with complex compound eyes. Over maybe  500 ft of mud and sand we see lots of different types of trilobites then they are suddenly whipped out. They have changed but not become a new kind. This change seems more designed from the start. Conventional scientists believe in 5 whip out events in the fossil record. But because there is little erosion between the rock layers it seems better in my view to see the sediment layers as evidence of mass burial in waves of sediment (mud and sand) in a short time span. We can breed dogs in say 200 years from Great Danes to Poodles. This is not evolution. The change we observe that animals can make appears to cause great variety, is limited (creatures don&#39;t become new  kinds) and can be rapid (compared to millions of years) and comes from elements of design within the Creature as well as mutations and natural selection.

Genetic variations can interact randomly with the environment to create even more variation between two bacterium even if they are grown from the same original cell when the bacteria pick up genetic snippets of the dead bacteria in the brine.  Also, if there is ANY contamination at ANY point in the over three decades long study then this adds even more genetic variation as different types of bacteria can share snippets of genetic code with each other. It would be virtually impossible to have no contamination the way this study is being done.  There can be a TON of variation, but all these variations only occur within the scope of what the creature is, the creature is simply using the available tools it has to its advantage and that is where all of the variation comes from.

There are strict limits to variation that are never crossed, something every breeder of animals or plants is aware of. \u00a0Whenever variation is pushed to extremes by selective breeding (to get the most milk from cows, sugar from beets, bristles on fruit flies, or any other characteristic), the line becomes sterile and dies out. \u00a0And as one characteristic increases, others diminish. \u00a0But evolutionists want you to believe that changes continue, merging gradually into new kinds of creatures. \u00a0This is where the imaginary part of the theory of evolution comes in. \u00a0It says that\u00a0new information\u00a0is added to the gene pool by mutation and natural selection to create frogs from fish, reptiles from frogs, and mammals from reptiles, to name a few.<br>Just to be clear, evolution theory puts no limit on what mutation/natural selection can invent, saying that everything in nature was invented by it - everything:<br>sex, eye-hand coordination, balance, navigation systems, tongues, blood, antennae, waste removal systems, swallowing, joints, lubrication, pumps, valves, autofocus, image stabilization, sensors, camouflage, traps, ceramic teeth, light (bioluminescence), ears, tears, eyes, hands, fingernails, cartilage, bones, spinal columns, spinal cords, muscles, ligaments, tendons, livers, kidneys, thyroid glands, lungs, stomachs, vocal cords, saliva, skin, fat, lymph, body plans, growth from egg to adult, nurturing babies, aging, breathing, heartbeat, hair, hibernation, bee dancing, insect queens, spiderwebs, feathers, seashells, scales, fins, tails, legs, feet, claws, wings, beaver dams, termite mounds, bird nests, coloration, markings, decision making, speech center of the brain, visual center of the brain, hearing center of the brain, language comprehension center of the brain, sensory center of the brain, memory, creative center of the brain, object-naming center of the brain, emotional center of the brain, movement centers of the brain, center of the brain for smelling, immune systems, circulatory systems, digestive systems, endocrine systems, regulatory systems, genes, gene regulatory networks, proteins, ribosomes that assemble proteins, receptors for proteins on cells, apoptosis, hormones, neurotransmitters, circadian clocks, jet propulsion, etc.\u00a0\u00a0Everything in nature - according to evolution theory.\u00a0\u00a0<br>Here is how the imaginary part is supposed to happen:\u00a0On rare occasions a mutation in DNA improves a creature&#39;s ability to survive, so it is more likely to reproduce (natural selection). \u00a0That is evolution&#39;s\u00a0only\u00a0tool for making new creatures. \u00a0It might even work if it took just one gene to make and control one part. \u00a0But parts of living creatures are constructed of intricate components with connections that all need to be in place for the thing to work, controlled by many genes that have to act in the proper sequence. \u00a0Natural selection would not choose parts that did not have all their components existing, in place, connected, and regulated because the parts would not work.\u00a0\u00a0Thus\u00a0all\u00a0the right mutations (and none of the destructive ones) must happen\u00a0at the same time\u00a0by pure chance. \u00a0That is physically impossible. \u00a0To illustrate just how hopeless it is, imagine this: on the ground are all the materials needed to build a house (nails, boards, shingles, windows, etc.). \u00a0We tie a hammer to the wagging tail of a dog and let him wander about the work site for as long as you please, even millions of years. \u00a0The swinging hammer on the dog is as likely to build a house as mutation-natural selection is to make a single new working part in an animal, let alone a new creature.<br>Only mutations in the reproductive (germ) cells of an animal or plant would be passed on. \u00a0Mutations in the eye or skin of an animal would not matter. \u00a0Mutations in DNA happen fairly often, but most are repaired or destroyed by mechanisms in animals and plants. \u00a0All\u00a0known\u00a0mutations in animal and plant germ cells are neutral, harmful, or fatal. \u00a0But evolutionists are eternally optimistic. \u00a0They believe that millions of beneficial mutations built every type of creature that ever existed.<br><br>Believing in beneficial mutations is like believing a short-circuit in the motherboard of your computer could improve its performance. \u00a0To make any lasting change, a beneficial mutation would have to spread (&quot;sweep&quot;) through a population and stay (become &quot;fixed&quot;). \u00a0To evolutionists, this idea has been essential for so long that it is called a &quot;classic sweep&quot;, &quot;in which a new, strongly beneficial mutation increases in frequency to fixation in the population.&quot;<br><br>Some evolutionist researchers went looking for classic sweeps in humans, and reported their findings in the journal\u00a0Science. \u00a0&quot;To evaluate the importance of classic sweeps in shaping human diversity, we analyzed resequencing data for 179 human genomes from four populations&quot;. \u00a0&quot;In humans, the effects of sweeps are expected to persist for approximately 10,000 generations or about 250,000 years.&quot; \u00a0Evolutionists had identified &quot;more than 2000 genes as potential targets of positive selection in the human genome&quot;, and they expected that &quot;diversity patterns in about 10% of the human genome have been affected by linkage to recent sweeps.&quot; \u00a0So what did they find? \u00a0&quot;In contrast to expectation,&quot; their test detected nothing, but they could not quite bring themselves to say it. \u00a0They said there was a &quot;paucity of classic sweeps revealed by our findings&quot;. \u00a0Sweeps &quot;were too infrequent within the past 250,000 years to have had discernible effects on genomic diversity.&quot; \u00a0&quot;Classic sweeps were not a dominant mode of human adaptation over the past 250,000 years.&quot;\u00a0--Hernandez, Ryan D., Joanna L.

It is much easier to break something than to make something, and evolution has a poor track record of making anything. Lensky&#39;s lab subsequently found the mutations responsible for this novel ability.  As I suspected as a creationist biologist, something was broken; the mechanism that suppressed citT gene in the presence of oxygen.  Mutations did not create a new gene or even a new promoter; they just copied and pasted what was already there in the bacterium&#39;s genome, in the process producing a bacterium that can no longer turn off the citT gene in the presence of oxygen (note that away from the artificial environment of a lab come out these bacteria would be male adapted because production of a transporter protein when it is not needed would be wasteful).  The results of mutation breeding and mutations in microbes underline once again that random changes or mutations do not create the needed genetic specifications to transform simpler organisms into more complex ones with new traits that require DNA specifications (brand new jeans and their control systems).<br> Nevertheless come up mutations of one form or another are the only mechanisms for evolutionists to explain the almost incomprehensible quantities of genetic information in the biosphere.

I love alot of your video&#39;s. But this one, this one, you are peddling some serious untruth. This is, in fact, a very well known experiment.  This experiment simply confirms genetic entropy.  Thus, it shows pre existing mutations.  <br>We could\u00a0say\u00a0that a man who lost both arms \u201cevolved\u201d the ability to wriggle through a small pipe leading to a new food source, but how would he fare among robust peers with arms? It is the same with these \u201cevolved\u201d bacteria.  These germs have merely shown beautiful examples of degradation in action.  <br>By doing a comparison of E. coli, in the same unique environment as used throughout the experiment, it was demonstrated that the E. coli have adapted to that unique environment. However, it demonstrated nothing about an overall increase in fitness. There is a very simple experiment that could have, and should have been done. Culture mutated and original E. coli in a normal environment that, for example, has plenty of glucose. I have no doubt the original E. coli would win.<br>The Lenski experiment shows that organisms change. That is something we already knew and that no one disputes. The question is: Is that change evolution? For evolution to be demonstrated the E. coli has to become something that is no longer E. coli. That has not happened, even after all the noted generations. Evolution proponents say that evolution takes much longer than we can observe, even in E. coli. That means we will not see E. coli become something other than E. Coli, but we will see change that will eventually lead to something new. Richard Dawkins famously said:<br>&quot;Evolution has been observed. It\u2019s just that it hasn\u2019t been observed while it\u2019s happening.&quot;<br>What&#39;s missing from this discussion are the answers to two questions: What are the characteristics of changes that would lead to a new type of organism (and evolution)? What is the character of the observed changes in E. coli on the molecular level? These are big questions and the answers fill entire books.

In the early days, people are figuring out the technique, where the players should stand, what roles should exist, etc. But thousands of years later, we are still improving and we aren&#39;t showing signs of stopping. We&#39;re still improving our running technique, our swimming technique, our wrestling technique, and those sports are all over 10,000 years old! Even soccer/football as we consider it today has been around for at least a hundred years and we&#39;re still figuring out the best formations, the best plays, the psychology behind penalty shots... <br><br>Another good one is non-physical sports (because you certainly can just evolve stronger people or train harder in physical sports). Poker pros from literally just a few years ago (Daniel ?Negreanu and Phil Ivey, for example) will tell you that the game is nowhere near what it used to be when they were in their primes. People try different strategies, sometimes make simulations, and they improve. You can also look at a game like Counterstrike or Melee, where there again haven&#39;t been changes in the actual format for 10 years, but the pros now will look at the pros from five years ago and say &quot;wow they sucked&quot;. In fact if you compare the stagnant games to changing games like League of Legends, for example, the improvements in counterstrike are more meaningful technique changes, while the LoL improvements are things like &quot;well in the new ruleset, it&#39;s more valuable to buy this item now&quot;.

Of course, a serious contamination would transfer to the new flask and be detectable later on but if it were a small contamination by a bacterium that was drastically less competitive in the solution yet still able to metabolize citrate then it could possibly be so out produced by the E. coli that it was eliminated after a number of transfers.

The way we look was about surviving the environment we were in. Yet there is only one human race. Darwin was right about selective breading. But even Darwin said it is not evolution. I have to admitt, I liked this channel a lot but you dropped the ball here. Selective breeding is how you get a beagle. The environment has no effect. But when the environment has an adverse effect on the animal the animal will develop the traits it needs to survive. Putting beagles in colder climate will make longer hair more survivable and soon (generations) all the dogs will have long hair. This experiment proves that what ever does not kill you makes you stronger. In this case it took twenty generations for the bacteria to get past a life hurdle using random selection and survival of the fittest. But there were no mutations. Genetic code never changes.

Stop running experiments on pre existing genes and claiming that mutations and natural selection can rewrite the sequencing thus creating new organisms.

By AMA.<br>Segment 1: 1 motor with bar connected to it standing vertically. Circular disc connected to bar that has magnets embedded in it surrounded in high permeability material to focus magnets outward pushing force in an upwards direction from top of disc. <br> Segment 2: Hollowed out cylindrical Bar of material horizontally positioned. <br> Flat hollowed out ring shaped material with openings around its outer top flat edge.<br> Magnets surrounded in high permeability material embedded in these openings.<br>Magnets positioned in openings around ring are in at least 1 of 2 configurations either all N magnetic field pushing out or N,S,N,S all around it. Just depends on whether your going for Piston structure or spinning structure explained below &amp; whether you want it to be DC or AC current. <br>Place these all along the cylindrical bar connected to it solidly, except at far ends of bar. <br>At both ends of bar place ring of material that can be magnetically repelled in specific locations. (magnetically repelled in specific location is in reference to outside of ring area that faces away from center of bar)(Other side of same ring facing in towards center of bar is capable of being magnetically repelled all around) Ring must be connected solidly to bar. points of repulsion on these rings is off set from each other on each end of bar. <br>3 Hollow ring structures with small square bars protruding from each. Ring structure has all magnetic repulsion on inside of ring shape &amp; can rap around the main bar so that the bar wont be causing friction on things as it moves back and forth or spins. 1st positioned around far left of bar, 2nd position at center of bar (be sure to leave enough room for magnetic structures to be able to move back and forth without hitting it) &amp; 3rd positioned on far right of bar. <br>Tube structure is constructed in two parts that fit together on top of each other length wise over main structure. <br>Tube structure has 3 square openings for the bars that the Ring structures that are connected around the main bar keeping it from causing friction on structure, to slide into. <br>This tube structure is designed with material that does not block magnetic fields. Perhaps some type of transparent material glass or other. <br> At both ends of the tube structure there is a built in circular groove that will house a round disc. The ceiling/floor/left side/&amp; right side of groove has openings for small magnets to be  embedded in it, so that the pushing force from magnets is pushing in towards the edge of disc that goes in this spot. There is also 4 openings located on the top, bottom, left &amp; right positions of the open groove. Small magnets are placed in these spots so when round disc is in position these magnetic fields will hit sideways keeping it from generating friction against structure. <br>Far Ends of bar has Cap structure that screws over tube halves holding them together. Cap structure also has 4 points on inside top, bottom, left &amp; right that have openings. These openings have small embedded magnets in them that exert there pushing force outwards (sideways) so it will keep disc in position, generating no friction against structure. Cap is made of material like tube so it does not block magnetic fields. (Note: These magnets in groove and cap structure are only needed for piston design. If Disc is directly connected to main bar so as it spins the bar spins, magnets are not needed here).<br> The disc has ring around it (ring of material goes around outer edge and folds over front side &amp; backside a small distance) that is repelled by magnetic fields so the 12 small magnets will keep it lined up but it will be able to spin without causing friction on structure. The disc has openings on it&#39;s flat side that face inside of tube and magnets surrounded in high permeability material are embedded in this disc. <br> The disc has small bar that is connected to it&#39;s center that goes all the way to the other end of  bar structure through the center of the hollowed out bar and connects to disc on other end. Disc on other end is set up the same but magnets embedded in it are off set in comparison. As first disc spins the magnetic fields will push against specific spot on disc connected directly to bar, pushing bar in other direction, once bar is fully pushed over, further spinning of disc will then align the other sides magnet to push it back.<br> Tube structure also has half moon shaped protrusion on inside and on both halves so when tube is connected they line up to make a full ring shape on inside of tube, these half moon shaped protrusions have at least 1 small round opening on it&#39;s side in middle of curve that faces away from center of bar. The opening has a small magnet embedded in it so magnetic force is repelling out sideways away from center of bar. The protruding ring is positioned to line up slightly further in towards center of bar then the ring of magnetically repelled material connected directly to bar. This way when bar moves right or left it is magnetically stopped after a short distance. <br>Copper coil setup: Copper coils are wound in at least 1 of 2 ways. Either coiled in circles next to each other (Like if you wound coils around a cylindrical bar) or laid out in a row as if wire was on flat table going up then bent to go down &amp; back up until it formed a flat rectangle of wire bending up and down and then the entire structure folded around tube. Copper windings are then lined up perpendicular to magnetic fields on outside of tube. Ends of copper coils are connected into separate construct that will allow electrical current to flow somewhere else. <br>Circular construct is built like a stand that goes around the outside of motor segment. Circular construct has flat ring of high permeability (magnetic field shielding) material that has small openings that will allow magnetic fields through specific locations. Top of circular construct has groove to allow the horizontal bar to balance on. Circular construct can also be placed on other end of bar so it is balanced. The motor segment is positioned so the disc connected to the bar that is connected to the motor is lined up so the disc passes under the horizontal bars disc that is at end of horizontal bar. The high permeability material keeps the magnetic fields in disc from hitting into the disc that spins or pushes the horizontal bar until just the right moment when the impact will cause the disc in horizontal bar to spin which will perpetuate the piston motion in the horizontal bar. More horizontal bars of the same design are built and positioned around the motor segment in a circular horizontal fashion all the way around. The bar connected to the motor can be increased in length to desired height (As much as motor can handle) and more of the exact same setup is repeated higher and higher up, maximizing the over unity potential of the construct to ridiculous proportions. :D Current from the horizontal bars is diverted to power the motor as needed and all other current is diverted to power my game console or the world. :) Interesting variation to this design would be to connect the spinning discs on far ends of horizontal bar to main bar that magnets are connected to so the magnets spin instead of getting pistoned back and forth. So long as moving magnetic fields are perpendicular to copper wires it should work.

Excellent interview skills, this is a clinic on how to interview someone and hear their perspective without interjecting too much of the interviewer.<br>This micro-evolution, where Natural Selection can select for new traits within a species, is something we can observe everywhere. In the world, every group of organisms undergoes competition for resources and slight adaptations or mutations occur. These adaptations and mutations are quickly removed, reverting to the original condition, once the cause of their appearance is removed. An example is Darwin&#39;s Galapagos finches, their beak size changed with the environmental conditions demanded it but once these conditions returned to normal the beak size of the finches returns to the normal size too.\u00a0<br>The real question here is the macro-evolution, the e-coli itself. Even though these bacteria have been in a perfect environment for them to multiply for 70,000 generations, in the absence of any predators, competition from other species, or harsh environmental conditions of any kind, every one of the bacteria is still 100%  identifiable as e-coli and not some other type of distinct bacteria or organism. Maybe this just would take an indefinitely long time or maybe this type of change just can&#39;t happen. All the evidence for macro-evolution we have is indirect.

In other words, there wouldn\u2019t really be any \u201cimprovement\u201d because there wouldn\u2019t be any need to. What would they be improving at? I guess what I\u2019m saying is that your environment is changing and it\u2019s hard to imagine one in which nothing changed. Even in lab conditions, there\u2019s still selective pressure. And as the colony grows, that pressure increases. So evolution is happening in the colonies not in spite of there being no environmental change in the lab, but because of it. Or are you saying that the environmental change is relatively small in the lab compared to the \u201cwild.\u201d And therefore, we\u2019d expect to see a higher rate of evolutionary adaption in the wild than we would expect in the lab? Or were you saying that even in a static environment, there\u2019s always a way to become better adapted to it, there is no perfect way to be adapted? It seems to me, nature would find the top best ways to be adapted and they would probably be different. But I also ask the question, is it even possible to keep the environment static and unchanging? And environment with 10 million bacteria in the same media is very different than an environment with 10. Even an environment with 11 bacteria is different than one with 10.

E.coli is not a species and, respectively, there is no way that an adaptation process can result in the origin of a new E.coli species. Second, Darwin is not an author of concepts of adaptation or natural selection. They were proposed long before him. In fact, Lenski&#39;s experiment is about adaptation and origin of new variants of a bacteria proliferating by mitosis (in contrast to meiosis required for Darwinian evolution). As an example of evolution, Darwin talks about evolution from bears to whales (because bears swim for hours). In contrast adaptation talks about an ability to survive in the presence of a toxin, for example again. The analogous for this would be development of tolerance to a mosquito or snake bite in humans. The list might be continued.  Lenski&#39;s experiment did not change our view on evolution of species at all, because it could not.

It does NOT have the ability to turn into a different KIND of life.  Anyone with an ounce of common sense knows this to be true. You can get an unbelievable number of types of dogs from the original ancestor through selective breeding, it is still a dog. But in adapting there is a LOSS of information or complexity. You can never breed a poodle back into a wolf because the original information is no longer there. Just as you can NEVER reverse your experiments to get back the original bacteria. Over the years all you have done is remove more and more of the original bacteria&#39;s genetic material.

I tried it on the members of the Evolutionary Morphology Seminar in the University of Chicago \u2026 and all I got there was silence for a long time, and then eventually one person said: \u201cYes, I do know one thing. IT OUGHT NOT TO BE TAUGHT IN HIGH SCHOOL!&quot;  So What led up to this? <br><br>Dr. Patterson had written a book for the British Museum simply called Evolution.2.  Creationist Luther Sunderland wrote to Dr Patterson inquiring why he had not shown one single photograph of a transitional fossil in his book. Patterson then wrote back with the following amazing confession which was reproduced, in its entirety, in Sunderland\u2019s book Darwin\u2019s Enigma:<br><br>\u2018I fully agree with your comments on the lack of direct illustration of evolutionary transitions in my book.

Where there is entropy, there will be life - eventually. I wonder how much energy would be required to increase entropy to the point where every possible evolution condition occurs congruently. Ha! Yet another universal rule, in order to speed up evolution like that you would have to greatly increase the rate of time, but doing so would of course require all available energy in the universe. <br><br>What separates this experiment from selective breeding? Can we use vector fields to explore this data further? Deinococcus radiodurans survives in space, a completely different entropy environment. Does genetic complexity play a role in this? Can we repeat this experiment again but with Algae? I would bet a million bucks it would do exactly that, eventually it would evolve as a response to a forced entropy condition.<br><br>Will Deinococcus radiodurans devolve it&#39;s ability to survive if allowed to breed in an environment traditionally more conducive to propagation? Yes! it would, eventually, but considering that a &quot;devolution&quot; would be incorrect, it would just respond to fit it&#39;s new environment better. Evolution cannot progress backwards as it is directly tied to entropy, which is tied to time. The only way to reverse evolution would be to reverse time.<br><br>Does intelligence fit somewhere into the math? Manipulation of one&#39;s environment must increase entropy, therefore increasing the &quot;rate&quot; of evolution. If you taught a fish to use tools would it eventually evolve hands? Of course they would, otherwise an octopus wouldn&#39;t have tentacles. Only reason an octopus has tentacles is to manipulate its environment. Octopus are proportionally far more intelligent than humans (they have very short life spans but are highly intelligent, a one month old octopus is already far more intelligent a human of equivalent age)<br><br>Alas here we are using intelligence to manipulate these bacteria. Therefore must it play an even stronger role than entropy itself! Yes! an infinitely intelligent species would of course be able to bypass entropy constraints, much like the experiment demonstrated above but increased exponentially; unless intelligence is a direct manipulation of entropy itself, not an entirely separate vector altogether. <br> <br>This data should extrapolate. It should not be exclusive to only bacteria, this must be a repeatable experiment, it&#39;s just incredibly hard to observe it because we can&#39;t speed up time so we can observe the process. It should also somehow relate to fractals, because if evolution is directly tied to entropy, and things like geological processes produce fractals as a result of increasing entropy we will therefore find fractals somewhere in the math.<br><br>This channel is so interesting", "comment_date": "2021-06-22T23:51:39Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "GreenTortillas77", "comment_text": "Scott Baio Jr.", "comment_date": "2021-06-22T23:49:55Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Claudio Benjamin Osorio", "comment_text": "How can you call this evolution when its MUTATION...

Maybe this will help clarify.<br><br>1. OH NO! Super bacteria! Dangerous!<br>There is nothing super or dangerous about this bacteria. It&#39;s non-pathogenic (meaning it doesn&#39;t infect you) E. coli, which is already present inside you by the billion. And the E. coli in your guts are playing out a game of survival with other bacteria, your body, and bacteriophages; these pressures encourage the evolution of traits that could be dangerous. The bacteria in this experiment just got better at glucose and citrate metabolism. There is no concern of anything dangerous coming out of this. You could drink one of those flasks and the absolute worst thing to occur would be food poisoning. <br><br>2. This isn&#39;t evolution, it&#39;s adaptation.<br>Evolution is just a change in allele frequency in a population over time. Which is obviously what occurred here. Additionally, adaptation requires evolution. So saying it&#39;s just adaptation doesn&#39;t make sense, adaptation is evolution. If you wanted a giraffe to crawl out of the flask in order for it to be evolution, I think you need to review some ecology and genetics texts. Evolution doesn&#39;t require speciation, and you wouldn&#39;t expect it here. This is a very stable environment, which conventionally wouldn&#39;t be considered a situation where evolution occurs at all. That was the point of this experiment, to show evolution occurs even in environmental stasis. And amazingly, it did. That is why this experiment is so awesome. <br><br>3. It&#39;s still bacteria!<br>This is exactly what the modern synthesis would predict. You don&#39;t ever stop being something, as monophyly would demonstrate. You don&#39;t outrun your ancestry.

Please, notice that the point of view presented in this video can mislead the public not familiar with the mathematics of molecular biology and evolutionary biology. By the way, only few, very few mutational processes would eventually lead, to an evolutionary event. As far I now, we do not know yet the molecular mechanisms on how it would happen. We can always speculate about it, like the effect of genes from retrovirus insertion in human genome and magically add millions of years to pretend the problem is self-solved, but this is not concrete science. The real fact is that the mathematics of current genomes is highly complex and most of the biologist are not familiar with it.

A mere duplication or stuttering error is not exactly new information, and you need new information to make robust changes in organisms.\r<br>The use of an amplification process to make aerobic utilization of citrate more efficient and all the other human interventions negates natural selection somewhat, increasing the tens of thousands of generations that were reported by many times.

In the illustration one species that looked like a classic ape, turned into a human which is a distinct and different species. I missed the answer in the video, but at what point did the bacteria become another species? Surely, there are new emergent species now distinct from E Coli swarming in the petri dish? I believe they said in human terms it represented 74 million years? Clearly, Darwin&#39;s theories of &quot;Survival of the fittest&quot;, and of continual &quot;adaptation&quot; seem evident. Has there ever been any argument that those things don&#39;t happen? Adaptation seems obvious without this experiment, for example people with different colors of skin, all of whom are people. I obviously missed something important, because this great scientist seemed to be throwing out the terms &quot;evolution&quot; and &quot;adaptation&quot; as if they were the same thing. Was this a bit of carelessness, or has this scientist concluded that evolution really means adaptation based on his experiment? If he still believes in a Darwinian evolution where feasibly this experiment, given enough time and weekends, will replicate all creatures who have ever lived on earth, and perhaps many worlds worth of new creatures, why did he carelessly convolute the terms? Perhaps he did it on purpose? If so, why? Also, if it seems to take 74 million earth years just to add one new course to its diet, and his theory of a slower, flattening change graph, how long, in equivalent earth years, do we have to wait to see any actual &quot;evolution&quot;? 30 more years, a hundred more years? What will that equate to in human years? Also, if we take away the controlled environment of a laboratory, would the changes shown be more likely to speed up, or slow down? If it slows down at all, can evolution as Darwin postulated it, even be considered a mathematical possibility?

In his work he\u2019s seen a lot of beneficial mutations come along but it turns out that the great majority of the mutations were in pre-existing genes and they either broke or degraded the genes. So the bacteria were evolving or improving more by devolution than by evolution. Darwin\u2019s theory needs to show that organisms can improve by building things, and that what has been missing in this terrific experiment. This E.coli experiment shows that trillions of random mutations are not capable of building anything new. By the numbers this E.coli experiment is giant but it\u2019s dwarfed by the size of a natural experiment involving humans infected with malaria. Every year about a billion or so people contract malaria so that\u2019s a billion times a trillion cells that are made each year on the planet. In recent decades scientists have exhaustively studied malaria they\u2019ve seen how it evolved resistance to several of the drugs used to treat it but what is more interesting is what scientists haven\u2019t seen. There were no new molecular machines, no new genes, and yet it had so many chances, evolutionary theory would\u2019ve predicted that you\u2019d get something really pretty impressive out of that, but it wasn\u2019t seen. This raises a serious red flag for evolutionary theory. The discovery that many beneficial mutations are actually destructive or degradatory mutations puts a huge monkey wrench into Darwinian theory. Not only can\u2019t Darwin\u2019s mechanism of random mutation and natural selection build complex systems, it has a strong tendency to degrade them. We see that overwhelmingly the good mutations come about by breaking old genes. So you\u2019re not making something new you\u2019re throwing out something you already had. We see it in bacteria we see it in mammals we see it in birds we see it everywhere that\u2019s been looked at so far. This evidence completely conflicts with evolutionary theory. What\u2019s funny is Lenski set out to to try to prove the creative power of mutations and natural selection only to discover that it doesn\u2019t have any creative power at all. The fact that this video fails to mention this is beyond me. There needs to be a radical rethinking of this Darwinian paradigm. Darwinian ideas are so entrenched in our culture that it will take time for things to change. Scientists need to start following the evidence where it leads. The view that mutations are our creator, not God, is the view most leading scientists favor. It is a worldview that supports the idea that humans, and all life, are the result of billions of genetic damages caused by carcinogens and other poisons, not an intelligent creator.

Maybe you summon avatars more easily, maybe avatars are harder to kill, maybe avatars are better at getting rid of other avatars by means other than high offense value, maybe avatars have less of a maintenance cost, etc. <br><br>Point is, the evolution of Trading Card Games and even some video games aren&#39;t that unlike real life evolution of organisms. The way I&#39;ve heard my dad talk about programing/coding reminds me of deck building too, the way each individual component of the deck informs the strategy/objective of the deck, and how that same (or at least very similar) objective can be fulfilled by other cards, and how many of those same cards can be used in other decks with completely different objectives, and how otherwise useless components can be rendered extremely helpful in the right context and vice versa. <br>No matter how good a deck is, it&#39;s not unbeatable and that the bigger the deck is (in games where the deck size is variable), the harder it is to avoid dead draws (which is when you draw cards from your deck completely unhelpful to resolving your current situation.

The bacteria normally live in hypoxic or anoxic conditions (little or no oxygen), where they ARE able to use citrate.\r<br>\r<br>Imagine you had those solar lights for the garden that automatically come on when light conditions are low.

None of them believes in creationism, intelligent design or anything like that. It is important to highlight this as the impression that many people have is that only religious people criticize evolutionary theory.\u00a0<br><br>Evolution and Darwinism:<br>First thing we need to do is to make a distinction between evolution and Darwin\u2019s theory of evolution also known as Darwinism or Neo Darwinism. On a public level these terms are thought to be the same, however academically they are not. So what is the difference? Evolution as a general concept means \u2018biological change over time\u2019. On the other hand Darwinian evolution has two parts, the history of life being represented by a tree, where all the organisms that have ever lived go back to one common origin and secondly that natural selection is the primary driving mechanism behind all this biological change.\u00a0\u00a0<br>Evolution is a basic observation in nature, we can see it before our very eyes. This basic type of evolution is simply true, it is happening all around us, butterfly populations change biologically over time, bacteria evolve resistance to medicine, fish lose traits that are detrimental over time etc. No one disagrees with this type of biological evolution being ubiquitous and this was well known before Darwin. Even the most primitive human being who has had no interaction with the civilized world would agree that this evolution is an undeniable observation. Darwinian Evolution is way more than this basic observable evolution it claims that all of life evolved from a single cell and all the biological change happened primarily due to natural selection.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0<br>Although it is absolutely clear that there is a difference between evolution and Darwinism, the public thinks they are one and the same. This confusion is not inconsequential. This is because people\u00a0conflate\u00a0this apparent observable evolution with Darwinian Evolution. They think evidence for the former is evidence for the latter and this is simply not true. Darwinian evolution has the twin thesis of the tree of life and natural selection and these require evidence other than the basic observation of evolution itself. Clarifying this distinction is important. So one who claims they are the same and uses this to argue for the truth of Darwinian evolution is actually committing a fallacy of equivocation.\u00a0\u00a0<br>Darwinian evolution is based on a probabilistic framework which has assumptions and importantly there are ongoing disputes and doubts about its central claims.", "comment_date": "2021-06-18T05:27:41Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "June Chua", "comment_text": "The scientist looks highly evolved and mutated himself", "comment_date": "2021-06-18T05:26:05Z", "likes_count": 7}, {"comment_by": "antibozo", "comment_text": "Feel like the Bounty sponsorship strategy undermines the video.

Romans 10:13 states &quot;For whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved.&quot;. \r<br>\r<br>   Eternal life in heaven is just one prayer away. All you have to do is believe that Jesus Christ, the Son of God, died on the cross for your sins. As an atonement for your sins. And rose from the grave on the 3rd day. Ask Jesus to save you of your sins and give you eternal life in Heaven. Salvation is a free and everlasting gift from God. Please don&#39;t let pride drag you into eternal punishment in Hell, but ask Jesus to give you eternal life in Heaven. If you&#39;re getting a strong feeling of resistance while reading this, it&#39;s because Satan doesn&#39;t want you to get saved. He wants you to resist, and think it&#39;s not real. He wants you in Hell for all eternity with him. Hell is not a fun place, like worldly people like to imagine. It&#39;s everlasting torture with no relief. I&#39;m only taking the time to text this, because I want to get the message out. There are so many distractions in life keeping people from witnessing to other people. Keeping people from thinking about salvation. Keeping you from thinking about life after death. Please, ask Jesus into your hearts to save you of your sins and cleanse you from all unrighteousness. Ask him for a place in Heaven, and he will save you from eternal damnation in Hell.", "comment_date": "2021-06-18T01:19:32Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Brad Davies", "comment_text": "That is not evolution it is a post hoc fallacy.

I don&#39;t know how much time we left on this earth before Jesus comes, but I want all of us to be ready when He does. Let&#39;s leave these things of this world behind for in scripture it says in Matthew 24:35 that heaven and earth will disappear, but my words will never disappear. &quot; Also in 2 corinthians 4:18&quot; So we fix our eyes not on what is seen, but on what is unseen, since what is seen is temporary, but what is unseen is eternal.&quot; Time is so short. And I always say this&quot; I want all of us to be saved. &quot; Jesus is coming back soon.&quot; with tears in my eyes I love you guys. Let&#39;s take Jesus and His words seriously in these time were in. I know the road isn&#39;t easy because there are so much distractions and temptations in this life. But through prayer and fasting we can overcome them. I&#39;m not\u00a0forcing anything on anybody or even forcing to do something they don&#39;t. But if you were to see your mother about to get hit by a big truck, you would do everything to try and save her and if you didn&#39;t, it show that you don&#39;t love her. So I do the same thing for us about the wrath of God that is to come. I don&#39;t want anyone I love, know/don&#39;t know or even those who hate or dislike me to face such things. Because I know every soul is precious to God and are valuable to Him. Because before we were born He knew us, He knitted us in our mother&#39;s womb, He called us to be His children . His love for us is so great and so strong, it&#39;s beyond human comprehension, that even the angels in heaven don&#39;t understand it. So I want to tell you it&#39;s time to get ready, time to prepare ourselves for the Second Coming of Christ, for the trails and tribulations and for the rapture. As you can see, so many people have turned away from God. The world has become so immoral, wicked, disgusting and violent. Killing people without any care or heart. And that shows that the love of God is growing cold in the hearts of people. Please be ready friends, for when the Son of Man comes. Time is running out. Let&#39;s not leave this world with regrets. Because I tell you this, my biggest regret is not knowing Jesus Christ earlier. I love you Guys and Jesus loves you too, that&#39;s why He didn&#39;t think twice about dying on the Cross for us, knowing that we may not even love Him back. Please take what was said today in consideration because ready or not Jesus Christ is coming back believe it or not Jesus is coming back. <br><br>How to be saved? To be saved, a man must confess that Jesus is Lord while acknowledging in his heart that Christ must have full rule over his life and that he died on the cross for our sins and was resurrected on the third day\ud83d\ude4f\ud83c\udffe. Also one must repent and turn away from thier sin. NOW, is the time to turn to JESUS, do it before its too LATE and the DOOR of Grace is Shut.<br><br>Prayer of Salvation in Jesus Christ\ud83d\ude4f<br><br>Dear Lord Jesus, I know that I am a sinner, and I ask for Your forgiveness. I believe You died for my sins and rose from the dead. I turn from my sins and invite You to come into my heart and life. I want to trust and follow You as my Lord and Savior.

I remember the hype surrounding the citrate result, with headlines like &#39;Lenski&#39;s bacteria learn to eat citrate! Evolution in action!&#39; But the reality is much more modest. All the biochemical pathways for metabolising citrate (Krebs cycle) were present in the original E. coli population. But the bacteria preferentially fed on glucose because a genetic switch ensured that citrate metabolism was switched off in the presence of oxygen. What happened during Lenski&#39;s experiment was elucidated by Zachary Blount and reported in Nature in 2012. A mutation damaged the switch, turning citrate metabolism on even when oxygen was present. This was followed by a double duplication of an existing gene which enhanced the effect. Note no new genetic information was created. This was confirmed by Van Hofwegen et al in a report published in the Journal of Bacteriology in 2016. This report stated: &#39;We conclude that the rarity of the LTEE [Lenski\u2019s long-term evolution experiment] mutant was an artifact of the experimental conditions and not a unique evolutionary event. No new genetic information (novel gene function) evolved.&#39; Michael Behe has followed Lenski&#39;s experiment closely and given a fair assessment of it in his two most recent books, Darwin Devolves and A Mousetrap for Darwin. He is appreciative of the effort Lenski and his coworkers have put in, but concludes that the results only show the limits of Darwinian mechanisms, with apparent increases in fitness being overwhelmingly attributable to genes being broken.", "comment_date": "2021-06-17T18:24:15Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Bob swayne", "comment_text": "Investing make up the top notch hemisphere of the wealth.

No, cats? The idea of &quot;intelegent design&quot; has been gaining momentum for a while now. Evolution, within the species, makes sense. But the laws of thermodynamics and entropy make it very clear, no matter how many billions of years you slap mud together, you&#39;ll never have anything more than mud. There are zero conditions under which you start with primordial soup and end up with any life. Besides, it beats the &quot;expert&quot; opinion. Aliens or crystals. Let me see thie &quot;alien&quot; theory through logically. An &quot;alien&quot;, capable of space travel ten thousand years ago or more &quot;seeded&quot; earth with life. Well, we&#39;ve gone from &quot;cave men&quot; to where we are today, with exponential growth, in about ten thousand years. Where would an already advanced &quot;alien&quot; civilization, capable of locating and &quot;seeding&quot; another planet ten thousand years ago, be today? If growth is exponential, they&#39;d be &quot;gods&quot; compared to us. What does the Bible sugest by contrast? That God is more advanced than even that. God is an interdimensional being, capable of existing outside of time, who can manipulate matter as we would tinker-toys, who built the entire universe, earth included, and who has an intimate knowledge of what is more important than matter: choice and character, not power and resources. Such an &quot;alien&quot;, in my humble opinion, would be worth listening to. The resources and power that limit us, human beings, would be of no consequence to such a being. They could walk on water, through solid rock, or generate an unlimited quantity of life and resources. Unlimited power. He wouldn&#39;t need power or resources, but he might want maturity and companionship. Devil in hell, anyone? Such a being could not abide the existence of other beings who do nothing more than destroy. Lies, hate, greed, lust, envy, gluttony, etc., to name a few, are all character traits that lead to destruction. What if you could share your power? Would you share that power with anyone immature enough to embrace destruction over peace, love, and forgiveness? Perhaps I&#39;m wrong, but I&#39;d sugest NOT. <br><br>God is real and the sooner we accept that fact, the sooner we can get back to the work intended for humanity: to become more God-like by listening, learning, loving, and obeying. God defines &quot;goodness&quot; not humanity. Why? He built all of this. I&#39;d say God knows a thing, or two, about how to run humanity, if he can craft a universe. The rest is up to us, a choice. Will we destroy or care for, because we certainly can not create so much as a blade of grass out of nothing.

The results were fascinating. It created patterns I would never think of.<br><br>BUT: I wanted to create a perfect result with 100% effiency. I was sure there was one. I let the algorithm keep on mutating two more nights. There were still mutations, but not so much anymore. The result stabilized. It got trapped in something like a false evolution state. I was sure there would be a better state. But the current &quot;stable&quot; quickly elimanted other solutions, that WOULD evolve into something better. It&#39;s difficult to explay. It&#39;s like having the first car-machine, and because the first car-machines are worse than good horses they are quickly eliminated and the horses win.<br>I tried several things to get this selection out of this conservative state, but nothing really helped. I then bred new generations from scratch at some point. Over and over again. And some could actually take a different path at an early stage and then actually managed to evolve into a mutation with 100% efficiency.

What happened to the bacteria was in short:\r<br>E. coli is normally capable of utilizing citrate as an energy source under anaerobic conditions. But in the mutated bacterium, the transporter gene was duplicated (copied) to a different location away from the existing control sequence such that the production of the transporter is no longer suppressed in the presence of oxygen.\r<br>So the ability of the cell to control the production of the citrate transporter was indeed broken (the cell is no longer able to turn off the production of the transporter)\r<br>The sorts of \u2018evolutionary\u2019 (read \u2018natural\u2019) innovations observed give no support to the idea that microbes changed into microbiologists. This would require not just duplication of existing genes, breaking of control systems, or co-opting of existing control systems, but the origin of thousands of brand new gene families (each gene family is so-called because they are quite different to other gene families) that are missing from microbes, along with their control systems.\r<br>There have been so many generations of E. coli cultured that every possible point mutation has occurred in the E. coli genome, and yet this is the best they can come up with!

Here is a question about bacteria evolution at the beginning of your video: does the mutation occur as the result of interaction with antibiotics, or it has happened earlier during bacteria growth?

It does not gradually mutate to break each barrier as it may seem in this experiment. Rather it just mutate so badly at some point in time that this single mutation is good enough to break all the barriers. The mutations are random, so it&#39;s not correct to say that at every barrier level bacteria adopt to the harder antibiotics. It could easily never break some of the barriers. But if it does, it means that the mutation for this evolution could have happened at any level, even at the very beginning with zero barriers involved.

If I understand Darwin, he said evolution results in new species (thus the title of his book, &quot;The Origin of Species&quot;).  So was the scientist saying his later generation of bacteria was a new species?  If so, the Europeans who came to America had an obvious advantage over the Native Americans when it came to handling diseases.  It&#39;s estimated that around 90% of the indigenous population died from diseases that had a minimal impact on the Europeans.  Does that therefore mean that the Europeans were a different species than the Native Americans?<br><br>&quot;Evolution never stops&quot;?  What about the horseshoe crab, starfish, snails, clams and even the coelacanth fish?  We&#39;re told that those creatures have met their &quot;evolutionary dead end&quot;, and thus are called &quot;living fossils&quot;.  They&#39;ve evolved so perfectly to suit their environment, they no longer evolve, thus what you see today is exactly what you see in the fossil record hundreds of millions of years ago.  So can evolution stop or not?  If it can stop, how can one prove that any existing animal or plant hasn&#39;t stopped evolving, or that all flora and fauna haven&#39;t stopped evolving for that matter, and there is no more evolution?<br><br>Last, to be honest, I was very disappointed with the &quot;longest-running experiment&quot;.  It seems to only prove that one group of a species can have a competitive advantage over another group.  We&#39;ve known that since Columbus discovered America; old news.  Even the owner of a chihuahua knows her dog couldn&#39;t compete in the real world against some dog like a huskie, but both are still dogs.  What has never been proven in the lab, but what Darwin tells us is an absolute established fact, is that one-celled animals evolved into multi-celled animals.  Are any scientists conducting experiments to prove that?  IMHO, the scientist in the video wasted decades of time and resources proving something we all already knew, rather that at least trying to prove something that could have been a real game changer.

You said that having a mutation rate which is too high is bad because it leads to offspring with too many deleterious mutations.  As I understand it, this is not the problem at all.  You would have to get to a very, very extreme mutation rate for that to be the case, and prior lineages would just die out before they could even get that far due to the actual problem with a high mutation rate - discarding beneficial mutations.  If an organism with a beneficial mutation occurs, a high mutation rate means the benefit will most likely be mutated out of the genome faster than the benefit can be felt.  It&#39;s similar to the reason that organisms with shorter lifespans tend to win in competitions like these where the only differentiator is lifespan at the beginning.  The long-living organisms can&#39;t acquire and hold on to beneficial mutations faster than the short-lived ones can evolve away from bad mutations.<br><br>Evolution never stops because of waste.  Think about it, if you had a theoretically perfect organism, likely a bacteria or something simple like that because they are the most adaptable, covering the entire surface of the planet, what then?  It dies in waste.  All living systems, at the widest possible definition, are localized reduction of entropy which requires increasing entropy and, crucially, requires increasing the entropy *in their local environment*.  They leave waste.  That, alone, creates an evolutionary niche.  Something which evolves to consume that waste will outcompete the organisms which can only produce it.  But, that organism will also have to produce waste.  The second law of thermodynamics becomes an engine of evolution, making any &#39;optimal&#39; situation nonsensical.  There is only evolving better ways to deal with the waste of other systems which are themselves evolving.  This sort of thing can even be seen in abstract cellular automata or genetic algorithms, the waste can be some miniscule change in a shared state, but that&#39;s all it takes.  That little kick of entropy from a &quot;living&quot; (the word &#39;living&#39; actually has no definable meaning, but that&#39;s a different topic) system which just wants to reduce entropy in its own little pocket of the universe gives rise to evolution.", "comment_date": "2021-06-16T23:48:02Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Greg Fakerson", "comment_text": "One of the best veritasium videos", "comment_date": "2021-06-16T23:47:42Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "cammobox", "comment_text": "Yeah, that&#39;s not the kind of evolution that results in new information.

There is a reason why you are supposed to take all your prescribed antibiotics and not just stop after you feel better and &quot;save them&quot; for next time. UGH! I HATE when people do that! You kill all the <b>suseptable</b> bacteria and then only the antiobiotic resistant ones survive in your body and then they have no competition from neighbors because they are all dead and a few days later the RESISTANT ones reproduce and thrive and now the new infection is resistant to the original antibiotic. Same thing happens when people take the same antibiotic frequently. Eventually all the microbes in your body become resistant. You need to take the course of antibiotics days after you feel better to make sure all of them are dead and your IMMUNE SYSTEM takes care of the few survivors. Also, antibiotics do not usually actually kill bacteria known as bacteriocidal, but antibiotics stop bacteria from reproducing, known as bacteriostatic. The immune system is CRITICAL in making antibiotics work, which is why people with impaired immune systems cannot just take antibiotics all their life and be fine. It doesn&#39;t work that way. And bacteria are also critical to good health and without them, all of us could not survive for long.", "comment_date": "2021-06-16T23:10:22Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Mohamed Farahat", "comment_text": "With all due respect, that is not &quot;Evolution&quot; this is &quot;Adaptation&quot;.

You can tell that a system is at the critical state and/or the edge of chaos if it shows waves of change and upheaval on all scales and if the size of the changes follows a power law. Of course, that was just a mathematically more precise way of saying what Langton had been saying all along: that a system can exhibit complex, lifelike behavior only if it has just the right balance of stability and fluidity. But a power law was something you could hope to measure.&quot;<br><br>&quot;To see how it might work, says Kauffman, imagine a stable ecosystem or a mature industrial sector where all the agents have gotten themselves well adapted to each other. There is little or no evolutionary pressure to change. And yet the agents can\u2019t stay there forever, he says, because eventually one of the agents is going to suffer a mutation large enough to knock him out of equilibrium. Maybe the aging founder of a firm finally dies and a new generation takes over with new ideas. Or maybe a random genetic crossover gives a species the ability to run much faster than before. \u201cSo that agent starts changing,\u201d says Kauffman, \u201cand then he induces changes in one of his neighbors, and you get an avalanche of changes until everything stops changing again.\u201d But then someone else mutates. Indeed, you can expect the population to be showered with a steady rain of random mutations, much as Bak\u2019s sand pile is showered with a steady drizzle of sand grains\u2014which means that you can expect any closely interacting population of agents to get themselves into a state of self-organized criticality, with avalanches of change that follow a power law.", "comment_date": "2021-06-16T22:16:12Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "sameer Shah", "comment_text": "so this is where my tax money is going", "comment_date": "2021-06-16T22:14:43Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "M_Horton", "comment_text": "Now Add a piece of plastic bag to each tube and see how long before we can get these guys to eat our rubbish...", "comment_date": "2021-06-16T22:14:40Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Guest Informant", "comment_text": "So Gain of Function then...", "comment_date": "2021-06-16T22:13:55Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Thomas Vi\u0161vader", "comment_text": "As soon as I saw evolution in the title I expected this comment section to be flooded (no pun intended) by creationists.

Resistance genes are sometimes transferred through viruses. In this case, a virus transfers the resistance gene it withdrew from one bacterium to another. And when a bacterium dies and disintegrates, another bacterium can absorb the resistance gene it releases into the immediate environment.<br>A non-resistant bacterium can easily add this gene to its own DNA molecules, because such resistance genes are usually in the form of tiny DNA particles called transposons that can easily be added to other DNA molecules.<br>In such ways, a whole colony of resistant bacteria can be formed in a short time from one resistant bacterium.

We are told that the bacteria have achieved this through mutations, and that is clear enough, but what in fact are the mutations doing? For example, given that the bacteria are being kept in simplified environments, are they adapting by disabling functions that they don&#39;t need in this environment to provide more energy for replicating here, or are they adapting by developing brand new functionality? If the former, they would presumably be uncompetitive if placed back in the &#39;wild:&#39; devolution rather than evolution, so to speak. Even the adaptation to digest citrate could be a costly mutation in other environments where citrate isn&#39;t common (hence they didn&#39;t start with this ability), so it could be that other functions are now not feasible because of this new one: it may not be an additional ability, but an alternative one instead - so has it been achieved by breaking something else? Obviously we don&#39;t have new species created from the old ones here, but even the adaptations may be a bit more limited than they appear at first sight.

I now realise there must be something that has to be called meta-evolution. Or evolution of the ability to evolve. Some patterns of DNA will be easier to mutate into usefull variations. If you see DNA like (programming-) language, I can say/program the same kind of thing in a lot of ways. However, some words I choose will be easier to turn into other useful words with the minor changes that we might see in DNA. Mutating to favor those kind of DNA-&#39;words&#39; MUST be something that evolves into DNA after enough time. Since adaptability is the key to survival. This explains things like &#39;dormant genes&#39; or introns. It&#39;s handy to have a whole piece of code that is just there because it was succesful once and is kind of commented out and can be put back in with a single change. This will give each new generation a slightly better chance at evolving into something useful, eventually causing even succesful or dominant species to die out, even if nothing were to change in the outside world.<br>It changed how I look at evolution. And I&#39;d like to bring this principle to the evolution of neural nets somehow..<br>Also I started wondering how long it would take them to mutate into something able to eat glass, scientists or both, which seems to be the other obviously abundant resource..<br>I also liked how you went back to common misconception after blowing my mind. Dishcloths spread bacteria, sure. But bacteria are everywhere ANYWAY and we need them to keep our immune systems functioning. So... what&#39;s the point of showing dishcloths spread bacteria? To sell tissuepaper, of course, because people fear bacteria, when in actuality we should all lick a dishcloth a day from birth, we would be immune athletes.<br>Same with the Covid measures right now. Once you flattened the curve and protected the vulnerable with immunity, you should infect everybody else as quickly as possible, not giving this nasty bug the time to evolve countermeasures.

Anyone who is saying mutation causes more complex life forms is a liar with no evidence to support their conjecture.<br><br>Better fitness is not evidence of evolution, else we would call Olympic athletes, banking Tycoons and the like a different species.  You guys are crazy to think that diet, and survivability has anything to do with a species changing it&#39;s gene pool to evolve into a different more complicated form.  <br><br>All you are showing in your lab evidence is differences in gene activation, gene corruption, and gene damage.  None of these bacteria are changing their morphology and gaining new more complicated body parts, DNA strands or any measurable difference in speciation beyond genus, which as you know, all members of the same genus are considered interchangeable when it comes to reproductive genetics.<br>Show me a bacteria changing into a fungus, or a multicelled organism, or I will never believe you are showing any evidence of  evolution in your lab data.  You are showing evidence of being an atheist evolutionist trying to prove through experiment that you are correct about your &quot;THEORY&quot;  of Evolutions and survival of the fittest and favored races.&quot;  complete Hitler racism at it&#39;s finest, thanks Darwin.", "comment_date": "2021-06-16T17:19:49Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Yury Vlasov", "comment_text": "That was inspirational", "comment_date": "2021-06-16T17:19:42Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "The Flyfly", "comment_text": "this is fascinating", "comment_date": "2021-06-16T17:19:38Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Boden", "comment_text": "I love this.
