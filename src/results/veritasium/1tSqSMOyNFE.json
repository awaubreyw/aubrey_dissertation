But in the case of positive and negative feedback, the biggest difference between positive and negative feedback, is that positive can increase your motive to learn what your learning. Because positive feedback respond to the human&#39;s need to feel good, feel love, get attention and believe in our potential, even if all of this is intense, it is also more pleasant to be suround with positiveness than negativeness. So in general, in your group, the mean should increase if you use positive feedback because you augment the motive and the feel good feeling of the student. A student motivated or that feel good gonna put more effort, more focus and maybe gonna practice on is own. Feedback is feedback so if you have relevant feedback, you still gonna be listen by those who are motivated. But positive is in the most case the best. But why then the jet student has different results. I like the explanation of the video, but still, I believe there is a causal explanation. I tougth first, that the motivation of a jet class, since you have a hard process to be there,  would not be a random sampling of the population motivation that you would have most of the time in other studies. But then a remember that in my high level badminton class I would see the impact of a coach with positive vs negative feedback. So that is not it because a pleasant environment is still really important. However there is an extern variable in the case of the jet learning. Driving a jet is dangerous, we all know that if you do a bad move, you can die by screwing up. So I think that a negative feedback when you do those class make you remember the relevance of the information that&#39;s gonna come if you do not wanna die. So in that case, remembering you could die, gonna put your focus on the highest you have. The think is a negative feedback in a situation so relevant like that doesn&#39;t event feel unpleasant and it increase focus. The idea actually come from my lesson from lead in climbing. I had that focus that I do not have as high as when I knew the feedback couldn&#39;t save my life. It would be interesting to test another jet class or another class of something dangerous to see if we observed the same behavior of if the statistique gonna win again ;) It is not base on any paper or something, and I&#39;m open to change my tought :)", "comment_date": "2022-09-14T21:27:08Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "BigTestes", "comment_text": "I have experienced this a lot with my video games, if someone praises me i feel like i can do anything and it&#39;s now expected of me, but when i do wrong and someone calls me out i now feel the need to protect my pride by proving them wrong and doing what they thought i couldn&#39;t.", "comment_date": "2022-09-14T13:00:43Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "fck peace", "comment_text": "Im exact the opposite: when I start something, I need dirt on me, but if I achieve something I want some praise", "comment_date": "2022-09-05T15:37:14Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "DEEPAK JOSHI", "comment_text": "1000 claps and still clapping", "comment_date": "2022-09-05T13:48:17Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Ray raycthree", "comment_text": "Maybe the soccer players receiving positive feedback were just better players with normally higher testosterone?", "comment_date": "2022-09-04T06:25:04Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "A G", "comment_text": "Why use A-10 model while talking about Fighter Jet training ?

It is true random chance plays a big role. For example the scientists doing controlled studies on positive feedback could be self-selecting themselves ideologically for these types of studies to prove a confirmation bias they already had and they may by chance be the type of scientists who fudge the data for a desired outcome. Negative feedback worked for centuries and you can read biography after biography to see that it is possible that people doing these studies are interested in the confirmation bias that they desire positive feedback environments. But if all humans desire positive feedback, then why would negative feedback ever evolve in societies and military cultures throughout the world independently? Because the science is not yet solid on this. Negative feedback does indeed work better, that experience matters, you can see this with chess players, constant positive feedback and no improvements, constant negative feedbacks and suddenly their skills go up. So how does the science explain this ? That&#39;s the thing, we don&#39;t know if certain scientists are just doing things for ideological reasons. We should scientifically test that bias. From a philosophical perspective, reality IS NEGATIVE, therefore, it makes sense that feedback must be negative, because reality is not positive when things are going wrong. So the idea that you can just use positive feedback or no feedback at all and see skill improvements in students is absurd and any scientist arguing that has to get their head checked.

When I had finished my enthusiastic speech, one of the most seasoned instructors in the audience raised his hand and made his own short speech, which began by conceding that positive reinforcement might be good for the birds, but went on to deny that it was optimal for flight cadets. He said, &quot;On many occasions I have praised flight cadets for clean execution of some aerobatic maneuver, and in general when they try it again, they do worse. On the other hand, I have often screamed at cadets for bad execution, and in general they do better the next time. So please don&#39;t tell us that reinforcement works and punishment does not, because the opposite is the case.&quot; This was a joyous moment, in which I understood an important truth about the world: because we tend to reward others when they do well and punish them when they do badly, and because there is regression to the mean, it is part of the human condition that we are statistically punished for rewarding others and rewarded for punishing them. I immediately arranged a demonstration in which each participant tossed two coins at a target behind his back, without any feedback. We measured the distances from the target and could see that those who had done best the first time had mostly deteriorated on their second try, and vice versa.

The gamblers &quot;fallacy&quot; is not a fallacy at all, it&#39;s a mis-statement of the strong law of large numbers. <br><br>It is true that if you flip a coin a certain number of times, a coin with two possible outcomes A and A-, heads &amp; tails, A and not-A, that the probability of A increases with each instance of not A. Because in the long run the probability of each is 50 50 but having performed the experiment X times, you now have only N-X repetitions to perform so that the probabilities ARE affected by previous outcomes. The whole question is just how much they are affected. There is a whole segment of game-show history based on this where a similar question was asked of Marilyn vos Savant who quickly and elegantly said that given 3 doors with a prize behind ONE of them, choosing one door (but not opening it) and then opening one of the other 2 doors to show that the prize was NOT behind it changed the odds that the prize was behind the THIRD door from 1 in 3 to 2 in 1. <br><br>People went absolutely apeshit over this. The universaly-accepted answer was that the odds were the same for the prize being behind one of the two unopened doors. But the probability calculation is pretty simple to show that this is not the case, and it is an excellent example of consumer bias. People simply want to believe that the door they first chose was the right door, the winning door, and if nothing else, just as good as the unopened, unchosen door. Not a door with far worse odds of winning than the 3rd door. But it is simple. When none of the doors have been opened, or even selected, the odds are equal of each having the prize. With one door chosen but remaining closed, the odds are unchanged. When the 2nd door is opened and shown to be false, the odds of the 3rd door having the prize become the same as the odds of the 2 un-chosen doors having the prize vs the chosen door, or 2:1. Again, a simple exercise in probability is just too difficult for most people to understand not to mention to accept, and I&#39;m not talking about average people, this answer upset a lot of scientists, even physicists if you can imagine that. They just cannot wrap their minds around the simple fact that given 3 equal chances, choosing 1 and being shown a 2nd made the 3rd twice as likely as the first. <br><br>It is just that counter-intuitive. <br><br>As long as the number of coin-flips is LIMITED, then the same phenomenon occurs. <br>Just as in blackjack, this is the reason why card-counting is outlawed at legitimate blackjack tables, the reason why high-stakes tables will mix together several decks in the shoe. <br><br>The odds only remain even when the number of coin-flips is unlimited. Just as in any card game, the odds of any one hand coming up depends on the number of possible opportunities for that hand vs all possible hands, which depends on how many decks are in the dealers&#39; shoe. Because the strong law of large numbers only holds when the test in question is repeated a large # of times. When the test is only repeated a few times, then the general probabilities (and inferred statistics) no longer hold, and as such the strong law of large numbers does not hold true.<br><br>Doesn&#39;t mean that flipping heads 3x in a row means that the next flip will be tails, again, no strict regression to the mean. <br>But tails is much more likely than heads if you consider only 6 flips. You can calculate it precisely by calculating the odds that out of 6 flips the first 3 will be tails and the 4th heads vs all the other possible combinations (or permutations) of 6 coin-flips...out of 4 coin flips the odds of guessing them all correctly is 1 in 16, but now you know 3 out of the 4 so the odds are now 1 in 2...again, ignoring the strong law of large numbers, and assuming that both remaining outcomes are EQUALLY LIKELY. <br><br>!!!!! But !!!!<br><br>they only become independent, so that independent outcomes tend towards the large-number average, when considering, oh I don&#39;t know, maybe 60 flips. Provable by experiment. Same with dice, same with any game of chance. That is what that 2nd class in statistics is all about, determining how many times an experiment must be repeated to have a good certainty of the large-number PDF of the experiment. <br><br>Don&#39;t laugh. This is the basis for quantum mechanics and much of modern physics, chemistry and engineering. <br>This is why Einstein refused to accept Bohrs&#39; theories. <br>He refused to accept that at its fundamental level, the universe was NOT random. <br>Just as many refuse to accept that at extreme energy levels the universe is no longer consistent. <br>But that&#39;s just two ways of saying the same thing.", "comment_date": "2022-03-29T03:17:10Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "touristguy87", "comment_text": "not quite accurate. <br><br>&quot;Regression to the mean&quot; doesn&#39;t mean that if you have exceptionally good performance on one test, then the next time that you take a similar test your performance will not be as good.

Were that the case, your performance would never vary away from the mean and as such the probability density function for your performance would not be Gaussian...in fact your initial performance would be so unlikely as to be almost impossible for you to ever achieve.

Belief is grounded in expectation, and expectation on that of limits (perceived as real or otherwise). Once you receive that A+ on the test and all the positive outcomes associated with it, the producer of the outcome (the limit) paradoxically establishes the basis for an opposite outcome. Now, regarding research on the subject, if that great game of golf, which was followed by a bad one, was just one game in a multi-game tournament, you would rightly expect another great performance to be met with even greater results, thereby maintaining motivation. But once the natural limit is reached (and it always is), the opposite results and behavior will inevitably ensue (every high is proceeded by a low equal in magnitude). Though often maligned, universal limits exist, and do so for good reason. Such is the basis of perception. Exceeding these limits requires the development of tool which are unnatural and antithetical to their reason for being (such as the grading system or medications which cause worst side affects than what were meant solve). Furthermore, while being maybe a bridge to far, I believe this all to be related to the wave-function in quantum mechanics. A particle with the possibly to produce any number of outcomes, once measured becomes somehow manifest in our shared perception and thus behave as expected. That&#39;s because it is impossible for the mind to simultaneously perceive something being two things at once (try to think about not thinking). Outside of this, exists the profundity of paradox (see Schrodinger&#39;s cat and double-slit experiment) and the minds inability to grasp the literal nature of things, such as an electron, for example. So while limits can, and often are, temporarily exceed by our perception, the universe will eventually and inevitably regress to mean. As said, &quot;what goes up, must come down&quot;...

It&#39;s almost presented as it&#39;s completely synonymous with the central limit theorem. It&#39;s absolutely is not. Only in a world were there are no intrinsic different propensities in a population would it be honest to present this phenomena as strongly as it&#39;s done in this video.<br><br>First of all, I couldn&#39;t find the study with the fighter pilots. It would be interesting to read. But the way you presented it I initially thought they were thinking &quot;Let&#39;s give some pilots primarily negative feedback while others positive feedback, regardless of their performance and see how it affects their future performance.&quot; However later in the video you realize. Aha, they simply gave the bad flights bad feedback.<br><br>Anyway, the example with the blood pressure is a good example were it&#39;s extremely unlikely this would be such a strong and predictive development and the factors you describe are not likely to be significantly more prone in the lower percentiles of the population. But you claim at <br><br><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1tSqSMOyNFE&amp;t=04m38s\">04:38</a> &quot;so the people who ended up in the bottom 10 percent on the first test, likely had these factors ALL count against them.&quot;<br><br>You choose your words almost as if all variations from the mean are caused by coincidences. That is a massive exaggeration of this phenomena, especially for that kind of example. Patients blood pressure&#39;s correlate very well with their previous blood pressure measure and huge changes in what percentile a patient is in are uncommon, at least if the tests are done within say 6 months and the patient is not outright ill. Using control groups is important no matter what though no denying that.<br><br>Also with speed cameras. First of all, you seem to assume speed cameras are only put up as a reactionary measure for accidents. That is also not true, especially not in Europe. They are often put up as random sampling with more mobile speed measuring equipment have shown the road section have an unwanted problem with speeding in the first place and then the idea is that a permanent speed camera will reduce the amount of speeding. You literally said <br><br>Then at <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1tSqSMOyNFE&amp;t=5m25s\">5:25</a>:<br><br>&quot;It would go down anyway simply due to regression to the mean&quot;. <br><br>Again, that is such a massive exaggeration of the phenomena this video tries to describe and you ought to know it. You are more or less talking like as if any variation of observations we do around us are primarily caused by &quot;random chance&quot;. Also many decisions are done only after extensive hypothesis testing anyway just to drastically reduce the risk of significantly over-estimating a current propensity.<br><br>Please try and avoid to take the subject of the videos you are making to such extremes. It&#39;s an unfortunate tendency that I observe are very prevalent on YouTube to make the videos appear as mesmerizing as possible. I appreciate the educational intent in general though!

For starters every study seems to use a different definition of what negative and positive reinforcement are so there is no consistency across these studys. Most the studies were short term in nature it&#39;s nearly impossible to determine if positive or negative reinforcment is better long term. What about both? A lot of these studies involved extremes. Give one group 100% positive reinforcment and one 100% negative. This is fine but it doesn&#39;t establish if either of these methods is superior to an 80 20 mix or a 50 50 mix etc etc. It seems to me the results of this data is very limited. Being 100% positive vs 100% negative over the short term with an extremely disagreed upon definition of what positive and negative are leads to better results for the 100% positive group. Okay but what about how the real world operates? Is there an optimal amount of praise vs. correction over long periods of time that offer optimal results vs. These extreme data sets.

Regarding tasks, more complex or creative tasks do not necessarily respond best to instrumental conditioning. Furthermore, schedules of reinforcement were found to be a significant factor even in simple straightforward tasks that tend to be suited to instrumental conditioning. Variable schedules of reinforcement were found to be most effective. In other words, chance itself is also in part rewarding to some extent regarding the timing of positive feedback.

I may be biased, as I flew fighters in the U.S. Navy.

A short YouTube search will bring up plenty of videos of 20 tons of flaming debris sliding across the flight deck from losses of concentration. It has to be driven into students that doing well once does not offset doing poorly another time. In undergraduate pilot training, you are graded on 20+ performance criteria per flight, with progression through (in the case of fighters) several different aircraft and quite a few flights. Any 2 unsatisfactory grades will result in being expelled from the program. There are no second chances, for the most part, certainly no third chances, and that reflects the seriousness of the job. Even once you have a great deal of experience, the pressure doesn&#39;t let up. Aboard ship, every pilot is graded on every pass and those results are displayed for all to see!

There, there is a very strong tendency for price to revert to the mean and revisit previous price levels, but the mean is constantly moving, since price is constantly moving. It becomes much more challenging to figure when things are at an extreme, and when they are actually not because the mean has slowly shifted due to the repetition of certain events (price points) being over represented. <br><br>Derek you are an excellent communicator and you make amazing videos.

Part of these observations has to do with individual perception of self worth.  Even self worth can be out of balance because it can only be gauged by evidence of capacity or actual ability to successfully accomplish a task. Even a task defined or test can be the distraction not the proof of an individuals inherent capacity. This is demonstrated in people who have inherent ability to test well and yet sometimes they have a limited capacity to complete a tangible task.  Some people need no test and are unbelievably capable with the tangible task.  The mean although important can be a distraction. The mean or norm, we are learning, is not recognizing capacity that may exist outside of the defined norm. Those who do exist outside of these definitions are usually the ones who get the most negative feedback.  In this age we are going to start seeing individuals emerging from outside the norm with great capacity because they had the individual strength to with stand the negative feedback without falling into the negative mindset that would not allow them to recognize their own self worth.  Others as suggested in the latest Joker movie will become susceptible to the negation and may even recognize a self worth  in the very state of negation...  This literally is proof that humans have inherent self worth, that is at our very core, that can not be denied  and even those in a state of negation will affirm through negation if they are not allowed to see it affirmed    What Carl Jung had to say about enantiodromia is extremely relevant to these considerations.       Contemplation on the reality of negation/affirmation  brings a different light to these matters that might have not previously been seen.     As an analogy to light, negation is a light that consumes and affirmation is a light that manifests exponential surplus.   Negation can be absorbed and a mind of negation sees only negation. Affirmation illumines through the radiant reflection of the one affirmed. The balanced mind in affirmation sees all things affirmed.  I affirm the mean, there is so much more to be affirmed in our deliberations. Even in societies current struggles there is a great need for the affirmation of the state of negation.

Those are two very different kinds of reprimand, perhaps someone might react well to the former, and perhaps someone who\u2019d been subjected to the latter for years might eventually no longer even be able to tell when normal people are angry with them, anything short of someone eight times your size screaming right in your face doesn\u2019t even register, and you go looking for trouble wherever you can find it because the universe hates you one way or the other, so why not, what\u2019s the difference?

Positive feedback in class sends the message to keep on going as you are (that study and visualization are working), or even that you can focus a bit less, and still get by with a decent lesser grade.

Now this kinda works if you think we have a better chance of getting a 50/50 split then anything else 49/51 could happen but it should be close to the 50/50. This to me says while each individual throw of the coin doesn&#39;t effect the chance of the next coin they do effect a sample. So lets say we throw a coin 4 times 100 times and we record the results. around 5 times I&#39;ll get a result of only heads and 5 times only tails, The rest of the numbers will be a mix of heads and tails. But if I got all heads we could see this as a high score right like on the test results. So when we flip again we would expect you to flip closer to the 50/50 or in this case two heads and two tails. Meaning that we expect even in this coin flip the results to regress to the mean right? I mean otherwise we couldn&#39;t expect that we would get the 50/50 split when taking samples. Now where my understanding might fail me is here, we take a sample of 1000, in that sample we flipped 40 heads in a row a 1x10^12 chance of happening. So this is an extreme result so we expect the next time to regress to the mean and come closer to the 50/50. Is it that it regresses to the mean or is it just that 40 isn&#39;t that big of number compared to 1000, and the more samples we take the closer we get to 50/50 cause the less it matters... as long as we are close 1100/900 means it was 60/40 ish. Ahhh see I don&#39;t get it... in my head they still need to even out to get closer to the mean of 50/50 meaning that to me we would expect the results of extreme like 40 heads in a row to even back out so while its a fallacy to think that cause we had 40 heads in a row the next time we expect tails to have any more of chance of coming up it isn&#39;t a fallacy to say that tails have more chance of coming up... I guess one thing I was thinking about was if the results are independent. In our world of maths we can say that they are independent but I think any time we look at real world data or anything real world even a coin toss or what the gamblers fallacy like the roulette table, none of them are independent, like Einstein said &#39;god doesn&#39;t play dice with the universe&#39; So maybe they are all connected...

For example: I am steering a car and I see that it is drifting to the right, and I correct steering to the left, and so on and on. That is an example of a negative feedback loop. Any evaluation which results in a correction is an example of negative feedback, whether the evaluation is positive or negative. A negative evaluation of test performance may result in a negative feedback loop in which the student buckles down, or in a  positive feedback loop in which the student becomes more frustrated, develops a mental block or quits the class. A positive evaluation may result in a negative feedback loop in which the student does even better, or a positive feedback loop in which the student decides that he or she is smart enough not to have to study for the next test.", "comment_date": "2017-04-26T17:52:16Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Dewey Leavitt", "comment_text": "If this is true, then odds are that I&#39;m going to become pretty kickass for the rest of my life.", "comment_date": "2017-04-24T22:56:48Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Dan Dart", "comment_text": "Hahah, love those test questions at <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1tSqSMOyNFE&amp;t=2m15s\">2:15</a>", "comment_date": "2017-04-24T12:53:19Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Radius Nightly", "comment_text": "I think it depends from person to person.

So if you receive negative feedback, you can become shy, go into depression or simply quit, that will keep you at your current stage or even worse, when it will become very psychological, or if you have high dose of spite, if you are self critic person in order to do something better, you will probably do it much more better in a row without <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1tSqSMOyNFE&amp;t=50m50s\">50:50</a> chances or fail, by that each person got <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1tSqSMOyNFE&amp;t=25h25m25s\">25:25:25</a>:25 chances, and because its cycle, you will go trough all of that.

If it is important, negative feedback tends to be better, on the converse less important tasks REQUIRE positive feedback. The reason I believe this is because of my son. If he can interdependently find importance in a task then I don&#39;t need add anything to keep him paying attention. As a matter of fact I find that it works best to subtract his inappropriate actions. As he finds a natural value of the task, he doesn&#39;t like the subtraction or distraction from the task, so he avoids the behavior in the future. However, if does NOT find natural value or importance in the task then he will tend toward not doing it in favor of something more valued or doing it poorly to &quot;get it over with&quot;. These are the times I give positive feedback. I have to add something to the task for it to be worth it. <br><br>In the fighter pilot example, even though they are two very different people, I will pretend they are carbon copies of one as you do in the video. This assumes that the type of feedback has no preference and does not have any unintended interactions with the ego. Both of the pilots feel their task is important. The one that received positive feedback was focused on the things he did well. He likely did those things again, however the entire run wasn&#39;t copied even if that was the goal like in racing. So we can assume the actions that the praised &#39;good&#39; remain, but there were un-praised &#39;good&#39; moments that  would be missing resulting in a poorer performance. The pilot that received negative feedback had those &#39;bad&#39; actions removed with no affect on the other actions of the run, so even if he did not make as many &#39;good&#39; actions he would still have a gain over his last performance.", "comment_date": "2017-04-21T20:28:58Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Kri$toff", "comment_text": "Why was the title of this video changed?", "comment_date": "2017-04-19T18:18:35Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Rene Schiffer", "comment_text": "Learnings: give posititive feedback on skill, attitude and effort - not on achievements.

However, at least in American society, we have a few things working against that being the default mode. First off, rewards often cost money, where punishments can make you money. See our prison system and the prison industrial complex for an example. Secondly, we still suffer types of stupidity such as what&#39;s sometimes called the &quot;Protestant work ethic.&quot; It&#39;s a term used to note the belief that work is it&#39;s own reward, and asking for actual rewards is immoral. Lastly, personality is a major factor, specifically towards moral development. People who fail to grow beyond the conventional stages, those who see authority figures and laws are legitimate because they&#39;re authority figures and laws, respond better to punishments than to rewards.

The first is that while they both tend to refer to a streak of good or bad luck and and based on the likelihood that eventually &quot;luck&quot; will average out, the gambler&#39;s fallacy assumes to force this &quot;evening out&quot; on the next coin flip. Whereas regression to the mean typically refers to an average over several more flips. Basically, the difference is that regression to the mean describes how we expect the average to behave over time, whereas the gambler&#39;s fallacy is a fallacy because it attempts to attribute that behavior to a specific outcome.<br><br>The other clarification refers to a concept of an &quot;average result&quot;. Such as the random test example where students are more likely to wind up in the middle than at the extremes (tossing a pair of die would be another example). In this case, because the average is more likely than the extremes, that when you get an extreme result once, that the next result is more likely to be closer to the average than it is to be even more extreme. The factor to remember here, is that if you remove the reference to the first result, the statement is simply the original description of the distribution (ie it&#39;s more likely to be closer to the average than at the extremes).

That kind of feedback is very useful in the world of employment. If a person is given a 5.0 (5 out of a possible 5) as a surprise midyear evaluation, and then their end of the year Evaluation that determines raises shows they are down from that 5 to a 4.5 or less, this gives many Managers the argument of no raise that year. This was used by Kinko&#39;s (before it became FedEx Office). At mid year the managers would give the Mid-Year evaluation as a way to help the employees know where they are lacking to help them improve. However, that mid-year evaluation was counted against them at the end of the years evaluation. More over, the Managers were told to give at least one if not two points higher for the Mid-year evaluation. So, there you go. This kind of feedback has it&#39;s advantage in the business world to save money and reduce giving raises. Additionally, many employees that stayed with the company actually worked harder, put in more hours, and strove to do a better job the next year. In most cases, it was not until the start of the 4th or 5th year that the employees came to realize they are never getting a raise or the raise will be only pennies on the hour ( 2 to 3 cents per hour). This also helps people understand why the employees that were horrible at a Kinko&#39;s were typically the long term ones who no longer cared about how they did, and the good employees often left by the start of the 3rd year (if that long), having gone yet another year with out a raise. <br>I wonder if anyone worked at a company that did this same thing?", "comment_date": "2016-04-07T15:34:54Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Andrew S.", "comment_text": "why not cheer up someone of how awesome they are while pointing at the things they need to work on in order to improve and do even better? this way u kinda manage to sit ur ass on both chairs!", "comment_date": "2016-04-06T21:14:50Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Ishai Haviv", "comment_text": "I think that there is another factor for the Israeli air force, and that is that Israeli fighter pilots are the most sure of themselves people around, so what they need is a bit of balancing, on the other hand the average student lacks self esteem so that if you tell them off they&#39;ll &quot;believe&quot; you and just think they suck", "comment_date": "2016-04-05T18:51:04Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "TheRosemaryRegency", "comment_text": "wow your videos are so clever!", "comment_date": "2016-04-04T12:35:47Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Hunyi Lee", "comment_text": "wew at the beginning his accent was kinda british", "comment_date": "2016-04-03T16:13:26Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Fiz", "comment_text": "I think with the Israeli fighter pilots it was due to the nature of their job, i.e very dangerous and one which requires a massive amount of responsibility.

Take football (soccer), for example, which I follow religiously. There are strikers with World class ability that fall into lulls, periods where they just cannot seem to score. What happens is simply that their psychology begins to influence their results moreso than anything else, including regression to the mean.

However, when we take a look at their training, it makes sense that they would have an increase in performance when they receive negative feedback.\u00a0<br><br>Look at it this way, a pilot can only fly if he has spent some 1.5 years in the appropriate school, but before he can do that he has to go through boot camp and get up in the ranks to a\u00a0lieutenant (correct me if I&#39;m wrong... I think this is right. :) ) So let&#39;s say that takes some 4 years.. so that&#39;s 4 years of negative feed back training. No wonder why they respond better to that type of correction.

(Bear with me - this is a monster of a &quot;comment.&quot;)<br><br>Assuming that you&#39;re right with your standardized test example, it makes sense that if - for instance - you get 100/100 on a test, and then you retake it, chances are (speaking in terms of probability) you&#39;re going to get less than 100/100 the next time.<br><br>This works for quantifiable ceilings (and floors - such as 0/100) because the inherent belief is that you can do no better than 100/100 and no worse than 0/100. But if we delve into more subjective examples, where the ceilings and floors are highly arbitrary and ill-defined (such as acting) the logic of it becomes increasingly psychological.<br><br>Matthew McConaughey, for example, won an Oscar this year. Imagine if he were to say &quot;that was the peak of my performing ability&quot; (the acting equivalent of a perfect score - 100/100). Using the logic from before, that would mean that he&#39;s likely to do a somewhat worse job in his next big performance.<br><br>However, the real McConaughey said that his hero is himself in 10 years. What this means is that there&#39;s an older, all-around-better version of himself that he believes he can always reach. In other words, he doesn&#39;t believe that there is a ceiling for his abilities. So the &quot;ceiling&quot; logic of his next performance being worst than his last may not actually apply because he doesn&#39;t believe it was his best possible performance.<br><br>I think this psychological distinction is important to note because standardized testing internalizes this idea that you have a floor and ceiling to your abilities, and you can&#39;t stretch above or below those areas, which is incredibly limiting to believe! And if you apply the logic of your video here to a ceiling that you believe you have, then it makes sense why some people fail before they even get started: They don&#39;t believe that they can grow beyond a certain point.<br><br>It also adds some weight to the motivational tough-coach routine, like the techniques used in the movie &quot;Miracle.&quot; The coach provided some harsh feedback and some kind feedback, but that ultimately wasn&#39;t the point.

It&#39;s main presupposition is that chance is real, which in general I reject, at least at the superatomic level. Sticking to the coin flip example, each flip is not really a 50/50 chance. Indeed, the result of each flip is predetermined once the coin leaves the flipper&#39;s hand, and is dependent upon factors such as the strength and angle of the flip, weather conditions, etc. There are machines that have been built showing this concept. The concept of a 50/50 comes from the observation of a pattern which exists within coin flipping, but has nothing to do with individual flips; somewhat similar to how individuals define statistics, but statistics do not define individuals. Given this, while past flips do not affect future flips, you can look to the past to predict the future.<br>I&#39;ll give you an example.<br>Suppose you flip a coin a large number of times, a hundred, maybe a thousand times, and the results of said flips are recorded, &quot;H&quot; for heads, &quot;T&quot; for tails. If you were to look to this ledger of flips would you suppose to find more instances of 3 of the same in-a-row, or more instances of 4 in-a-row? Logic would lead us to say more instances of 3 given the larger probability of doing such. From this we can conclude that when given the 3 in-a-row situation, more times than not the next flip is going to be an instance of the opposite side of the coin.

Say, for example, an athlete trains over and over and begins to win more and effectively raising the mean? Wouldn&#39;t punishment be more effective in the long run? Let me elaborate, both reward and punishment are set to a certain standard. You can&#39;t scold or praise some one if you haven&#39;t first set a goal or stranded. So if you begin praising someone in the beginning for reaching that standard on a couple of occasions, once they reach your standard, there&#39;s no more praise left to give?

The outcome of failure in these scenarios could result in the death himself or the death of an ally. Negative reinforcement can do a far better job to help motivate a recruit to train harder and to treat the next exercise with a more serious attitude. Positive reinforcement can cause complacency in the military, which is why it is not used as often. Complacency kills in wartime.<br><br>Also, the &quot;culture&quot; side of it I think has far more to do with it as well. In military culture, negative reinforcement goes far beyond negetive marks on a report. Usually negative physical, mental, and emotional reinforcement is used.

I want to be as concise as possible because I think it might be real easy to either be super vague or imprecise about the progression of logic I&#39;m trying to put forth.\u00a0<br>First let me begin with a variation on your basic premise.<br>Instead of Punishment or Reward, what about Investment, Punishment or Reward?<br>I add investment because it changes the locus from external validation to internal. You as an individual invest in yourself for your own benefit (regardless of outside verification. positive or negative)<br>You mention the idea of cultural bias possibly skewing the results, I agree. My expectation is that pilots in general are taught massively intricate details about how and why planes do what they do so that under abnormal circumstances pilots can improvise appropriate solutions (or execute maneuvers with precision).<br>Perhaps that difference in learning environment leads pilots to invest more time in being better where other test subjects might not have such stringent standards for progress.<br>For instance 100 test subjects sitting in a classroom taking a math test wouldn&#39;t be worried about dying if they failed the test or didn&#39;t pay as much attention.<br>It would seem pre-existent yet continuing standards for failure might compel fighter pilots to focus more towards self betterment having received a negative response (possibly because it serves as a direct reminder of what can happen if they fail when it truly counts).<br>I know this might sound weird but bear with me. The definition of the word Sin is to know the right way to do something but to choose to follow your own path anyway. It implies a sense of education to know what is right (and yet not do it anyway). I&#39;m not religious but it seems like an appropriate concept for this situation.<br>If regression to the mean implies random responses to a series of questions (or in the case of fighter pilots a series of situation based conditions) then by the standards which pilots are trained regression to the mean wouldn&#39;t apply.<br>I believe fighter pilots are trained to perform physically with a complete set of information to work with and thus to fail a maneuver would be a Sin. The point to their training is to not make random decisions under any circumstances.<br>If their failure was caused by something outside of their ability to account for physically/logically then perhaps that shouldn&#39;t be a part of the statistical assessment (or at least accounted for as an anomaly or subset).<br>Long story made short the difference in the value/need for learning/experience might also skew the results.<br>I&#39;m kinda curious if investment might not change the average participants commitment to the testing process.<br>For instance if you took the same one hundred students (this time in an accounting class so still math) and told them that their ability to parse out results in a coherent manner leads to a direct increase in the amount of money they will make for the rest of their lives. How much would it skew the test results. Would more students pay more attention or would outside factors such as overall goals per student (for instance accounting not having anything to do with their major) \u00a0keep them focused on other things?<br><br>Without find a way to account for these variables identifying multiple test groups becomes way more problematic. I believe you need more than just a control group but a means to identify the mental frame of reference of all test subjects in relation to their investment towards the outcome of the test presented.", "comment_date": "2013-11-24T10:26:24Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "TheOriginalElkstone", "comment_text": "Trick is balancing praise and wellbeing with punishment and the want for self improvement", "comment_date": "2013-11-24T10:20:34Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "josef959", "comment_text": "Is it just me, or are the variables on the wrong axes for the testosterone graph?", "comment_date": "2013-11-24T09:50:34Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Jimthousand", "comment_text": "I have a feeling you&#39;ve put too much emphasis on chance, regression to the mean, etc...
