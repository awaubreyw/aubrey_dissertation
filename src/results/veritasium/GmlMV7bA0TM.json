But, physics and in mathematics, still use \u201cForce\u201d as thou it were something physical that could enable the initial cause of motion making it counterintuitive.\r<br>Example: Choose an object of your choices and without applying the energy from within you, try to push and pull by applying \u201conly\u201d the Force or Net Force.\r<br>Meaning that Energy (applied energy) is the origin of motion and not \u201cForce\u201d.\r<br>Once Energy (E) is applied, it creates what is known as Momentum (p).\r<br>When this Momentum (mass and velocity) comes in contact with an object(s), it makes a surface contact that will enable you to push and pull. Example: Ep=ma, Ep=mv, Ep=mc2, and so on. Note: Ep is not to be confused as Kinetic Energy in any way.\r<br>Momentum represents things like work, wave, gravity, light, lightning, tsunami, radiation, earthquake, current, electricity, motion, magnetism, hurricane, etc.\r<br>Without Energy, there is no Momentum. Without Momentum, there is no surface contact on an object(s) to push, pull, work, shaping objects, motion, gravity, magnetism, radiation, etc. Momentum does not and cannot exist without the applied Energy that creates it.\r<br>Energy and Momentum or \u201cEp\u201d is the only common denominator that links all fundamental forces of nature. Without Ep, all fundamental forces of nature would be inert and non-existence.\r<br>Energy is energy, but it\u2019s when Energy (E) is being applied that creates the Momentum (p) making it the initial cause of motion.

Well for starters, is gravity a force? I&#39;m sure I read it was an accident of geometry that is hard to explain. Lets call it force for today, pulling me down. Parametric pressure pressing on me from all directions. Blood pressure pushing out. Muscular force pushing away from gravity. Friction with the air slowing me down. Centrifugal force pulling me up at about .03 of a G. The Coriolis effect might influence me on a minute scale. Inertia holding me back from any each movement and momentum trying to keep my movement going. Then I suppose there are things like emotional pressers trying to influence how I move due to love, fear or advertising. After that there are direct drive responses that push me about like, pain, cold, hot and hunger. And then above all there is time, can&#39;t have movement without it.
