This is called the new moon.<br><br>The next day when the moon has moved a little further on in its orbit, you&#39;ll see the sun setting in the west, and a thin crescent moon next to the sun. That&#39;s when you see part of the sunlit side. The thin crescent moon sets in the west shortly after sunset.<br><br>When the moon is one fourth of the way in its orbit around the earth, you&#39;ll see what most people call a half-moon, but the proper name is 1st quarter moon, the part that is lit by the sun, and part of the dark side not lit by the sun. When the first quarter moon is at it&#39;s highest point in the sky, the sun and moon are 90 degrees apart, and the sun is setting in the west.<br><br>When the moon is half-way around in it orbit around the earth, you see the side lit by the sun, and the dark side is facing away from us. The moon and the sun are 180 degrees apart. As the full moon rises in the east, the sun is setting in the west.<br><br>Then, when the moon has moved three quarters of its way in its orbit around the earth, you see a half-moon again, properly called the last quarter moon. During the last quarter moon, when the moon is at it&#39;s highest point in the sky, the sun is rising in the east. The sun and moon are 90 degrees apart.<br><br>As the moon moves further along in it&#39;s orbit, appearing closer to the sun, it&#39;s a thin crescent again, which rises shortly before sunrise.<br><br>I find it appalling that most of my fellow Americans don&#39;t understand this.<br><br>But then, I shouldn&#39;t be surprised, since about 25% percent of Americans believe that the sun revolves around the earth.<br><br>They&#39;re probably sports fans, Republicans, and Christian Fundamentalists who believe that the earth is only 6000 years old.<br>\u00a0\u00a0", "comment_date": "2014-03-24T14:43:18Z", "likes_count": 4}, {"comment_by": "Pero Nakov", "comment_text": "<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jip3BbZBpsM&amp;t=0m43s\">0:43</a> Putin!", "comment_date": "2014-02-26T02:20:33Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Vortx", "comment_text": "How can everyone see the moon?
