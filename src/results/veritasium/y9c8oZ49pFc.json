The spot in the middle however has completely disappeared.  It only exists when the lazer is at a particular angle relative to the object.  That is not how the light should behave if it is waves causing this effect.  I think there must have been something else at play.  Specifically I think the light is bouncing off the wall at the back behind the shadow, some of it is coming back and hitting the object (all over) but at precisely the middle it is exactly perpendicular to the wall meaning you get to see only that spot lit up on the shadow.

Period.  It is not a wave.  It is a particle.  When you try to explain what gives rise to these strange interference/diffusion patterns, it gets complicated, but Feyman&#39;s genius is in the way he can simplify it so that you can understand that yes, light IS a particle and NOT a wave.  Search for QED, Feynman to find his series on light reflection/interference.  Your brain might explode from how awesome it is, but again, light is NOT a wave.  It is a particle. This wave-particle duality of light is one of the most mistaught ideas in physics.  I&#39;ve been telling my students for 25 years that light is a wave and a particle.  But now that I know better, I will word it properly: Light is a particle, but some of it&#39;s behaviors can more easily be explained as if it were a wave, but it&#39;s not a wave.

And this topic, I think, if ever taken into consideration, should be analyzed by taking into account brains(brain technology?) and our body. If for example our bodies are highly advanced technological pieces then are our brains even more advanced than that? Can these two be even compared this way?

Spatially coherent light can easily be made from any incoherent light source, however I have some comments to make about the way you tried making it with the beamer. You see, beamers work in a very specific way, namely by a set of mirrors that can reflect light very quickly for different colors to build a RGB image. However I think this construction of how the beamer builds it&#39;s image is actually bad for trying to make nice planar waves, I hypothesize that you in fact get many disruptions in your nice plane wave because of this, this might have foiled your attempt. Also, the projector try, you didn&#39;t even try to make it spatially coherent as far as I could tell from the video, so obviously it didn&#39;t work. You can make a spatially coherent source easily with a candle and a single slit/hole for example, which is probably how they did it back then.", "comment_date": "2015-10-15T21:23:16Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Edward Carmack", "comment_text": "Great vid, graphics and explanations as usual.

Now I have a paradox for you. Maybe you&#39;ve heard it before, but it&#39;s interesting nonetheless. Here&#39;s how it goes: You have three spaceships, A, B, and C, all pointed in the same direction and all weighing 2kg (to simplify the math). Spaceship A is stationary, and spaceships B and C are moving at a constant speed of 1 m/s. Spaceship B then accelerates to 2 m/s and holds a constant speed. We&#39;re interested in calculating the energy it took to accelerate from 1 m/s to 2 m/s. First, let&#39;s say we&#39;re observing from spaceship A. We see spaceship B accelerate from 1 m/s to 2 m/s, so from the equation KE = 1/2 mv^2, we have a change in kinetic energy of 3 J. Next, let&#39;s say we&#39;re observing from spaceship C. Since we&#39;re moving at a constant velocity, spaceship C is a Newtonian reference frame. Thus, we observe spaceship B accelerate from 0 m/s to 1 m/s, giving a change in kinetic energy of 1 J. This gives us two largely different values for the amount of energy used. So the question is: how is this resolved? The solution involves a more in-depth analysis using conservation of momentum, but it makes you think twice about using kinematic equations without checking the result.", "comment_date": "2015-10-14T21:33:00Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Levatation", "comment_text": "will I ever get my postcard?", "comment_date": "2015-10-14T21:32:58Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "highcc", "comment_text": "I&#39;m not well convinced by your experiment.

And when the father came home she was missing. He then went out looking for her with his lantern. But didn&#39;t find her. Anyways for a very long time around this area people have been going to this spot and yelling &quot;daddy&quot; very loud while flashing your lights down the hill. This location is a dirt road that goes up a very long hill and at the top is a cabin and very old cemetery in the woods. And many people including myself have seen a green orb come up the hill towards us. Now I think you should investigate this. Why? Because I don&#39;t think it&#39;s the ghost of this old man. I think there is a natural phenomena going on here. The place is pitch black. I mean so dark you can&#39;t see an inch in front of you.
