Pressure melting is only a small contribution to the thin liquid layer of water on ice, the more dominant cause of slipperiness is a quasi-liquid layer on the ice which is always present due to the inter-facial forces between air and ice.  These van der Waals type forces cause a thin water layer, or more accurately, a mobile H2O molecular layer a few atoms thick, which persists for fairly cool temperature all the way down to about minus 30 to minus 40 degrees Celsius, below which ice surfaces get fairly dry.<br><br>The pressure-melting is a common misconception.  It is simple to prove it is the wrong explanation.  If you take two snow balls and hold then very lightly together with almost no pressure, after a few moments they will sinter together.  So this cannot be due to pressure melting.  It is due to the interfacial quasi-liquid layer on all the snowflake surfaces, which allows the surface molecules to sinter or bond with no need for pressure.  You can also do the same experiment with ice cubes.  Just keep them in the below zero freezer, but hold them in contact lightly, they still sinter together with hardly any pressure needed.  This is also why ice cubes in your ice tray eventually get stuck together, there is no significant pressure doing this, mere contact is sufficient.", "comment_date": "2017-08-19T17:43:38Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Glenn Bailey", "comment_text": "I am just now watching through all of the channel videos for the first time.

An exceptional property of water ice is that its melting<br>point decreases under pressure (most substances behave in exactly the opposite<br>way). This may lead people to rush to the conclusion that ice melts under a skate,<br>and the athlete (or the beginning skater) actually slides on a thin layer of water<br>rather than the surface of ice. However, this is far from logical: many drivers know<br>that an icy road is more slippery than a wet one.<br>What is wrong with the ice-melting argument? Well, the argument only says<br>something about the direction of changes, but never tries to estimate their magnitude.<br>If we think a little deeper, this theory about ice melting under skates would<br>lead to a number of consequences that are definitely not true.<br>1. Children would have more difficulty when skating because their weight is lower<br>and they would exert a lower pressure.<br>2. The colder the temperature is, the more difficult would be to move on a skate as<br>higher pressure would be needed to achieve a larger change in the melting point<br>of ice.<br>3. On a single leg (or skate, to be more precise), it would be much easier to skate<br>because the pressure would double compared to a pair of skates.1.8 Ice Skating and the Science of Sliding 19<br>4. A puddle would form below someone standing on a skate on ice for a longer<br>time.<br>5. Much higher efforts would be needed to achieve higher skating speeds as melting<br>of ice is by no means an instantaneous process.<br>Let\u2019s estimate than how much the melting point of ice changes below a skate. To<br>help our thinking, we can make good use of the phase diagram of water, which is<br>shown in Fig. 1.6. In this graph, temperature (\u200aT) is displayed on the horizontal axis,<br>whereas pressure (\u200ap) is shown on the vertical axis. One of the simplest ways to use<br>this diagram is to decide what form of water is stable under a certain pressure at a<br>given temperature. All we have to do is to find which part of the diagram the point<br>falls. In Fig. 1.6, 1000 bar and \u22125\u00b0C is within the area labeled liquid water, so one<br>can be sure that the stable form of water is liquid under these conditions. At first<br>sight, it may seem surprising that water is a liquid below its usual freezing point.<br>As already explained, the external pressure also influences the temperature at which<br>water freezes (or ice melts). Similarly, the boiling point of water also depends on<br>pressure. From a phase diagram, one can read the actual melting point of ice at any<br>pressure: all we need to do is to find where the boundary lies between ice and liquid<br>water at that pressure.<br>It should not be left without notice that there are three kinds of ice on the phase<br>diagram. Ice, similarly to many other solids, has more than just one possible crystal<br>structures, that is it has several different ways in which the molecules can arrange<br>themselves in a regular pattern. These crystal structures are stable at different temperatures<br>and pressures. In fact, science knows many more form than displayed on<br>this graph. This is also true for many other chemical substances including carbon,<br>which is known both as graphite and diamond\u2014the latter being thermodynamically<br>unstable but far harder and more expensive (\u2192 4.13).<br>Fig. 1.6\u200a A part of the phase diagram of water. (Authors\u2019 own work)<br>\u00a020 1 Misconceptions in General<br>Finally, one can also see from the phase diagram that it is impossible for liquid<br>water to exist below \u221222\u00b0C, as no part of the phase diagram below this temperature<br>is labeled liquid (\u2192 4.17). If someone were to insist very much on the theory of<br>melting ice under a skate, they would have to conclude that it is impossible to skate<br>below this temperature. The experimental observation, however, is quite clear: ice<br>can be very slippery even at \u221230 \u00b0C.<br>How large is the pressure under a skate? This is not very difficult to calculate,<br>but you may need to refresh your elementary physics studies. The blade of a skate<br>may be 20 cm long and 2 mm wide, so the surface is 0.2 m\u00d70.002 m=0.0004 m2<br>,<br>this doubles to 0.0008 m2<br>\u00a0for a pair of skates. If the mass of an average person is<br>80 kg, the weight is 800 N; the conversion factor between the two quantities is the<br>gravitational acceleration on the surface of Earth, which is approximately 10 m/s2<br>.<br>So the pressure exerted by the skate on the ice is 800 N/0.0008 m2=1,000,000 Pa<br>=106 Pa=10 bar. This is barely ten times the atmospheric pressure on Earth, which<br>is about 1 bar (or 105 Pa or 1 atmosphere\u2014scientists and their units can be perplexingly<br>diverse). In Fig. 1.6, the melting point at 10 bar is hardly any lower than 0 \u00b0C.<br>Much higher pressures are needed for a significant change in the melting point.<br>A counter-argument for this line of thought was put forward as early as the nineteenth<br>century. It says that the uneven surface of a skate blade makes the actual<br>contact surface a lot smaller. Even if this is true, there is no small enough surface<br>for skating below \u221222 \u00b0C. Higher pressure is usually accompanied by higher friction<br>as well, which actually acts against the movement, and could be much more<br>significant than the melting point depression of ice.<br>Friction, however, offers an even deeper line of thought. Friction produces heat,<br>which can melt ice in a very thin layer. However, friction can only produce heat<br>during movement. Ice is known to be slippery even for objects that are stationary,<br>there is no extra effort needed to begin the movement. And forces of friction tend<br>to be quite small on ice\u2014this is the very reason why it is slippery, and small forces<br>can only generate a small amount of heat.<br>What could the explanation be then? First of all, the surface of ice is very even,<br>or at least it is when conditions are ideal for skating. The even surface offers little<br>chance for the small bumps on the surface of the sliding object to stick to anything.<br>In addition, water molecules on the surface of ice experience less interaction than<br>those in the middle of the substance, which means that they also move easier. It<br>is sometimes said that the surface of ice features an extremely thin (maybe one<br>hundred thousandth of a millimeter) layer that resembles a liquid. But this does not<br>mean actual melting at all. This surface is always there, the presence of skaters does<br>not make a difference.<br>Finally, remember that there is something called synthetic ice. Skating fields are<br>sometimes made at places where it would be very expensive to maintain freezing<br>temperatures. This synthetic ice is made of a special kind of plastic, the melting<br>point of which actually increases as pressure increases. Skaters on synthetic ice do<br>not seem to care at all.&quot;<br><br>It is a rather informative and great book, I recommend you to download (or even buy) it :)", "comment_date": "2015-02-04T03:14:21Z", "likes_count": 13}, {"comment_by": "Alma Somerville", "comment_text": "Really interesting things going on here, almost conflicting principles such as absolute vacuum boiling water, like the NASA guy that his space suit was compromised and recorded feeling the very water on his lips to instantly boil, but then the compression of air in your diesel cylinder causing diesel to combust from pressure causing heat.", "comment_date": "2015-02-02T20:49:48Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Stefan Koning", "comment_text": "Wouldn&#39;t the melting point of ice (or any substance) increase when you compress it?
