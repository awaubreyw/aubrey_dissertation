I&#39;m confused??", "comment_date": "2014-07-16T08:47:45Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "TheArnoldification", "comment_text": "a few people are confused about scientific notation. So, let me give a quick crash-course. Scientific notation is properties of &quot;10^n&quot;; that is, we plug in a number for that &quot;n&quot;, which in turn represents a product (they tend to be really big or really small). Let me give you an example where scientific notation can be really helpful.<br><br><br>E.g. 5 trillion x 2.3 billion =?<br><br>rewrite as: (5.0 x 10^12) x (2.3 x 10^9)<br><br>multiplication is communitive (that is, orientation of variables in an expression doesn&#39;t matter) so we can multiply the numbers attached to their &quot;10^n&#39;s&quot;. 5 x 2.3 = 10.6. As the bases are the same, we can simply add exponents without changing the 10, so we get 10.6x10^21, in which 1.06x10^22 would be proper notation. It&#39;s really easy math. You could solve this kind of question much faster in your head than the time it takes to punch it into a calculator.
