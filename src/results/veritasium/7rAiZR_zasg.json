Recall that from the top you see the letter pressed from the top but you see the other letter from below during the spin. Thus there&#39;s a third factor.  If you slow the youtube playback you can see a <b>vibration</b> blurring the o when you see the x, and visa versa, and you can see both x and o are otherwise about equally affected by the spin and rotation. This vibration is imparted by the snap, and the vibration moves back and forth from end to end of the tube, and the vibration blurs the letter on the end that is vibrating. The period of time for the vibration to move from end to end is a multiple of the period of the rotation, thus vibration and rotation of the tube are synced, because the impulse energy is simultaneous for both. If you press the x you impart the vibration to the other end for that instant while the x faces up beneath your finger, and thus the instants when the x end is not vibrating happen when the x is up, which of course are also the instants when the o is up for exactly the same duration but is vibrating.

But as a photographer, this raises another question for me. My understanding is that if one presses down on the X, you thereby instigate a combination of longitudinal and axial movement which results in movement of the tube, such that the X which is moving relatively slower, will be &quot;perceivable&quot; to human vision, as well as an inverse rate of turn and spin on the O which then moving faster, and is beyond human perception.<br><br>This must mean that when moving from the slow speed of point-X towards the fast speed of point-O, there is a point at which human vision loses the ability to perceive the shape of a marking on the moving object.\u00a0<br><br>In photography terms, it would be similar to if one were photographing a moving object, and at each pass using a longer and longer exposure duration, starting first with very rapid durations and then increasing the time. There comes a point in the progression where the rendered image changes from depicting the moving object as if it is &quot;frozen&quot; in motion, to showing &quot;motion blur&quot;, to eventually reaching a point at which the moving object cannot even render its form onto the captured scene. In this regard it&#39;s probably truer to keep the shutter duration constant, but to increase the speed of the hypothetical moving object.<br><br>My question is therefore, does human vision work similarly to that of motion cameras which capture a series of chronological frames? And at which point does our human vision lose the ability to perceive this movement?<br><br>We&#39;ve all seen video footage of how the propeller of an aeroplane, when starting up, seems to spin one way, then momentarily appear static (albeit blurred), then reverse direction. This is because of where the propeller blade is in each successive frame, and due to the fact that the accelerating spin rate eventually &quot;synchronises&quot; with the camera&#39;s frame rate, to create the static effect, and then accelerates further to break that effect and create the appearance of the propeller reversing its spin. And depending on the frame rate and the rate of spin of the prop, this can occur more than once. At some point the propeller might become &quot;invisible&quot; to the camera due to it&#39;s high speed - this depends on the shutter duration being used.<br><br>But, unless I&#39;m mistaken, the same thing happens with human vision - just at different rates to those of most cameras, which typically shoot at 24-60 frames per second.\u00a0<br><br>So I guess my real questions are: if this is the case, and human vision does in fact work similarly to motion cameras which make use of a series of captured frames, what is the equivalent &quot;frame rate&quot; and shutter duration of (average) human vision? At what point do humans begin to perceive moving objects as &quot;blurred&quot;, and at which point do we loose the ability to see them moving?\u00a0<br><br>Thanks for the lesson.

Now, the camera&#39;s sensor automatically increases shutter speed to compensate for increased light when you point the camera towards the sky. When you point the camera toward the ground, it is not as bright and it selects a slower shutter speed. Slower shutter speed shows you the X, higher shutter speed shows you the O. If Derek switched to manual shutter speed, he can force the shutter speed to show X instead of O when filming from below the glass.

When the front side is viewed, which we will call the &quot;front side view&quot;, notice how 9 o&#39;clock is to the left and 3 o&#39;clock is to the right.<br><br>Now imagine that the tube initially had its tubular spin axis aligned with the connect between 12 o&#39;clock and 6 o&#39;clock. Following the axial spin of this tube, we will call the &quot;back side view&quot; the view where the relative positions of 3 o&#39;clock and 9 o&#39;clock are swapped, while 12 o&#39;clock and 6 o&#39;clock are unswapped. Now that we defined both the front and back views of the clock, we note that if the tubular axis spin causes the labels to move from left to right on the front side, continuing the tubular axis spin will cause the labels to move from left to right on the back side as well. The results:<br><br>1) The label at 12 o&#39;clock (call it Label X) is still moved in a clockwise direction by the tubular axis spin, regardless of which side we look from, and<br>2) The label at 6 o&#39;clock (call it Label O) is still moved in a counter-clockwise direction by the tubular axis spin, regardless of which side we look from.<br><br>The rotational effect on each label caused by tubular axis spin is unaffected by what side we are looking at, but the effects for each label are opposite of each other (clockwise for Label X and counter-clockwise for Label O).<br><br>The rotational effect on each label caused by principal axis spin are both the same (clockwise), but when we look on the other side, we see that this effect has reversed (counter-clockwise).<br><br>If we take the scenario of the principal axis spin causing the tube to tilt the same way as the hands of a clock, then the combined result is that:<br><br>1) From the front side view, Label O (6 o&#39;clock) is more visible than X (12 o&#39;clock), as from this view the tubular axis spin makes Label O move from left to right, causing counter-clockwise motion with respect to the clockwise-tilting tube (retrograde motion).<br>2) From the back side view, Label X (12 o&#39;clock) is more visible than O (6 o&#39;clock), as from this view the tubular axis spin makes Label X move from left to right, causing clockwise motion with respect to the counter-clockwise-tilting tube (retrograde motion).<br><br>Now why then would the label that you put your finger on be the one that you can see better during the spin (i.e. the one with apparent retrograde motion)? The reason is that you are applying a torque which generates the both the tubular axis spin and the tube&#39;s principal axis spin simultaneously. When you push your finger on one end while retracting your finger, your push causes the end to slide against the surface of the table, while your retracting finger induces a roll which appears retrograde from the sliding motion that you are initiating. However, the movement of that label is only &quot;retrograde&quot; from that side, because, on the other side, the movement of the label on that same end you pushed on would instead be seen moving &quot;prograde&quot; with the principal spin and thus will be harder to see when you look from that side.", "comment_date": "2013-12-21T07:45:11Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Paul", "comment_text": "Makes perfect sense....
