It is so much simpler and different than this claim! &gt;&gt;&gt; Simply correct your body pH and you can avoid their bites.

Potential hydrogen = Your body&#39;s &quot;electrical currency&quot; - (Being too high or low matters) When you are out of proper pH range you will literally attract the bugs that bite. When your body pH is in proper range the electrical currency will deflect them. This can be EASILY proven in crops, humans and animals alike.  A body that is commonly out of proper pH range will not assimilate nutrition thus, leaving the body weaker &amp; more susceptible to both bugs and disease. However, when our bodies are in proper range? We assimilate like the machines we were designed to be.

He called me directly and said this in Korean.<br><br>you have to go there The time has come for the world to close, and my sons and daughters still don&#39;t know me.<br><br>Since then, for about 18 years, God has been with me and showed me a lot of visions through dreams.<br><br>I had no idea at the time what the word of God meant. However, since 2009, God poured out the Holy Spirit like a waterfall, showing all the signs of Yeshua&#39;s coming, what is happening around the world.<br><br>Yahweh the Creator focused on me the rapture from beginning to end.<br><br>Do you know this facts?<br><br>1. The clouds in the sky around the world are gradually coming down to the ground.<br><br>2. Every day we see a super moon, a super sun.<br><br>3. Looking at the pink sky.<br><br>4. Chemtrails are being sprayed in the sky around the world 24/7 like crazy.<br><br>5. The moon is spinning round and round.<br><br>Unless you are not blind, this fact can now be seen with your eyes in the sky.<br><br>From 2017, 2018, 2019, 2020, 2021, and 2022, God showed me the vision that Nibiru is coming continuously.<br><br>Nibiru is a being of light like the sun, and God showed me that Nibiru is a small system. There are several planets in Nibiru, one the white planet and the other the red planet.<br><br>Now you are looking at the pink sky. This pink sky will, in time, appear very thick in skies around the world. When that time comes, even the air in the sky around the world will appear purple. At that point, the axes of the north and south poles are change. At that point, the Earth around the world will be completely twisted and crushed. A cataclysm will occur on this earth, and that point will be when the clouds have come down to the very surface, and that it is just one step before the coming of Yeshua.<br><br>Yeshua is the real God.<br><br>He is the creator of all things and is the eternal God.<br><br>Yeshua is coming very soon. God showed me vision that Yeshua God has received a letter of permission from Yahweh to bring your brides from the earth. Now, in the closet in heaven, God showed me that the linen clothes for the brides of Yeshua have been taken out of the closet.<br><br>You will now see two suns rising and setting here and there very soon, you will see two moons in the sky, and you will see a very large white planet floating in the sky. God showed me the vision that when we see with our eyes a very large white planet in the sky, we enter Rosh Hashana (The Wedding of Yeshua).<br><br>There is going to be a rapture very soon.<br><br>Satan knows everything, and both Satan and evil spirits know that there will be a rapture very soon. They are now administering the Viper Snake Injection, which is part of Satan&#39;s mark, fighting for one second, and now they are administering it very urgently to children under the age of five.<br><br>Fighting for a second, the world is in a great spiritual warfare, and Satan and the evil spirits have become even more urgent now because the rapture is coming very soon.<br><br>Because all souls that can be captured must be captured.<br><br>I heard the direct voice of Satan. In Korean, Satan said:<br><br>Yahweh! All the souls we wanted are all left on this earth. Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha~.<br><br>Those on the plane of the rapture and the ship of the rapture in Yeshua Coming, under any circumstance and environment, do not eat, do not inject, do not receive. I recommend that you keep your human identity to the end in any situation and environment.<br><br>God show me the vision that Yeshua God treats the brides of Yeshua who will be raptured, the sons and daughters of God recorded in the book of life, as kings and queens.<br><br>I encourage you to keep your faith in Yeshua until the end.

As is my experience with mosquitos. About 5 years ago, I moved to a friend&#39;s property just inside the inner loop a couple of miles from the center of Houston, Texas. While waiting for the building of a Container home, I lived in tents in the backyard. Eager to visit, my friend&#39;s dogs would tear holes in the sides. The available bathroom was in a building across the yard. Not compulsive about clothes and alone on the property, I wore little more than speedos. For an occasional bug repellent, I used a self-formulated spray based on Red Cedar oil, the same wood used for wool storage boxes. At night as I would go to the bathroom, I was a walking 6-foot mosquito salad bar. I just put up with the bites. I did learn as their wings would beat against my skin that mosquitos are a bit clumsy at landing. The itching was expected. But strangely, after a couple of weeks, the itching went away. I had become immune to the three or four mosquito varieties in the yard. But that surprise was eclipsed by what happened within a couple of weeks. While watching TV, my left forearm felt a little fuzzy so I took my right hand to wipe away whatever the fuzz was. To my surprise, my left arm was fuzzy from the elbow to the wrist. Pausing to look, I discovered that I was brushing away a dozen dead mosquitos. Looking closely, I saw another half dozen still stuck to my arm. They were held in place by their Proboscis still planted in my skin. The only explanation that I have for this is that some part of the immunity I developed to their saliva became a rapid deadly poison to them. As I told this story to friends, one who spent much of her time outside replied that she experiences the same thing.", "comment_date": "2021-12-27T15:29:00Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "\u00dcbermensch", "comment_text": "Nice to know the only thing that will be attracted to me is a mosquito", "comment_date": "2021-12-27T15:22:26Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Useless Artist", "comment_text": "So that&#39;s why I get bitten like once a year!", "comment_date": "2021-12-27T15:21:35Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Paraone Butler", "comment_text": "Anyone hear his voice crack at :19", "comment_date": "2021-12-27T15:19:54Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Apex Ghatak", "comment_text": "Mosquito don&#39;t bite me more", "comment_date": "2021-12-27T15:19:46Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "PaRaDoX AgonY", "comment_text": "Cause my blood good af", "comment_date": "2021-12-27T15:15:44Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Charles Twigg", "comment_text": "Imagine the government making these into bots so they can kill off people.

What&#39;s the difference?  Also, I am a mosquito beacon...  if I am there, they will come. Like a moth to a flame. However, I do wonder, how much of &quot;are you a mosquito attractant&quot; is subjective. I mean you are asking people to report that. There are many factors that would make one more prone to feeling like they are bitten by mosquitoes more often than others. For example, allergy. Some people who are bitten may not feel the bite at all, others may feel them, but aren&#39;t overly bothered by them so they dismiss the event. Still others like myself, may have some allergy to them, and being bitten is painful, and causes massive local redness and swelling. The bites puff up and swell to the point they become open sores. Borrowing some data from other videos,  the more significant an event, the longer the event feels in your head. The more you subjectively suffer from being bitten by a mosquito, the more likely you are going to remember the event. Similarly, if someone believes themselves to be an &quot;attractor&quot; then any amount of mosquito activity would give them confirmation bias. Sorta like seeing a yellow car, when you&#39;re thinking of a yellow car. <br><br>These factors may make a person more or less likely to report being an &quot;attractant&quot; while the number of actual mosquito bites may be exactly the same as someone who reports NOT being an attractant. That and the question is subjective. When you are out in the woods what is &quot;a lot&quot; of mosquito bites? One? Two? A hundred? You also need to consider environmental factors with these reports, such as, do you live in the city, the country? Is the gene being examined one that makes someone more likely to enjoy the out doors and therefore they get bitten more often? Is it more likely to make them &quot;successful&quot; and therefore live in a city where the mosquito population is controlled, either directly or indirectly. Does it make them prone to liking water sports and therefore live near bodies of water that mosquitoes breed in? I mean the list is legitimately infinite.

I was raised predominantly right on the edge of the English forest. We had lakes and miles of endless forestry. I never got bitten by any mosquitoes. After which over the years I lived in various regions of England. I enjoyed many camping and caravanning &#39;RV&#39; holidays all over the UK and never suffered from mosquito bites. Over the years I became a globe trotter and have travelled to most parts of Europe many times, even to Russia and never had a mosquito bite. I have also been to regions of Brazil, and also several other South American countries mostly cities or coastal regions and never got bitten by mosquitoes. I have been to 13 States in America from NY to CA across to FL and all across most Southern States, and even in Florida which is known for mosquitoes, I never once got bitten. But, since coming to TX for some crazy reason I have become a magnet to the mosquitoes here so much so that, I can no-longer enjoy enjoy the luxury of even sitting out in the garden without being smothered in terrible mosquito bites that each Spring/Summer is now a living hell! Our entire lives now revolve around mosquitoes that we cannot open a window, even with bug screens the smaller mosquitoes get through. To even open the front or back door we have to do this fast otherwise they will get into the house. We have large fans blowing each time we open the garage door. To have to spend your summers which is supposed to be enjoyable, covered in clothing from neck to toe, unable to wear a summer dress, or shorts and a crop top, not unless I cover myself in repellent which I hate, is just a horrible way to have to live. Gone are the days when over in the UK we all use to have the patio doors open and all the windows open during summer, enjoying the garden with friends and family and never having to deal with anything like mosquitoes. We even had a large pond and water fountains. So imagine trying to sunbathe in our garden here in TX would be a living hell with these mosquitoes, it just couldn&#39;t be done. We have planted herbs, citronella, regularly get the grounds sprayed, used foggers, burned oils lamps, ensured there is no foliage or sitting water,, but nothing seems to work! We cannot even grow the flowers we wanted.

I remember, gathering with around a dozen other people for a scuba diving trip.  We all waited in a big circle, talking and shooting the breeze.  It was about 7AM and just getting light.  Then we noticed that everyone in the group was going crazy slapping themselves, slapping their arms, legs, neck, chest, anywhere their skin was exposed.  And they all started complaining about being chomped on but the pesky things.  But we stood there and never received a single bite!   We were both vegetarians and not the least enticing to those ravenous mosquitoes!   I go years and years without ever being bitten by mosquitoes.   Maybe in five or six years, I might get one mosquito bite, a very rare event for sure!    Eating meat causes your body odor to become extremely enticing to those little vampires, and we vegetarians are living examples of what I&#39;m talking about.  We go everywhere outside, with no mosquito repellent ever, because our vegetarian bodies are a natural mosquito repellent.  So if you have serious mosquito biting issues, consider skipping the animal products...plus you will feel and look much better!   When I became a vegetarian, over 40 years ago, I weighed 155 pounds.  I&#39;m 5&#39;2&quot; and that was way too much!   It took about 8 or 9 months to come down to 105 pounds, which I&#39;ve maintained all these years.   Diets don&#39;t work, because after the diet, people return to their old eating habits and end up gaining it all back, plus some...and I know that personally!   It must be a life-change or else you will end up always being overweight and unhappy.   There are thousands of delicious veggie meals to discover on the net, plus a plethora of books at the library and book store.  Being a vegetarian does not mean only eating bowls of vegetables.   Say, if you went to a Thanksgiving dinner, and there were 25 dishes on the table, you can have everything except the turkey...and even the dressing if it&#39;s prepared without turkey.  Do you think you&#39;d walk away from that dinner hungry?   Of course not!   Plus, almost all restaurants now serve very delicious vegetarian dishes, and you can have Italian, Mexican and Chinese, etc., etc. so there is no excuse to feel deprived by giving up the flesh pots!   So, anyway, after all the lab testing, trying to figure out who gets mosquito bitten, it all boils down to your diet.  And as long as you eat meat, you will remain a banquet for those hungry biting, little monsters.   BTW...if you do go vegetarian, it will take a few months before you become repulsive to mosquitoes, as it takes while for all the meat odors to leave your body.  So do be patient, and you will eventually be able to stay outside in perfect peace, while others are being driven crazy and eaten alive...it&#39;s your choice!

No exaggeration, 100&#39;s of bites per day. Now, for the last thirty years  or so I am completely immune, not just to mosquitos, but deer flies, black flies, Bee&#39;s and spiders. I am still the main guy they attack to the point where people notice and ask me how I stand it; I tell them they still get in my nose and eyes due to the massive swarm that is always focused on me more than others, and how that can be a pain, but then I show them that I have no visible bites or itches.

It is an incredible design! You seemed very fascinated by the various factors included in this research. I agree it was interesting thank you for sharing the information. I just wanted to point out a few more interesting facts, mosquitoes are NOT in the  &quot;animal&quot; category. They are insects, which unlike animals, they don&#39;t have lungs and they breath through their skin. Also, I believe in science, real science that is, which can be observed and tested. The Theory of Evolution, is a religion, consisting of a bunch of guessing that is not backed by facts. Have you ever seen a monkey give birth to a non-monkey? Or a fish give birth to a bird? Lol of course not, sounds odd don&#39;t you think? So why would you believe you came from a monkey? Evolution describes, a mass explosion of rocks that somehow formed a single monkey and somehow it found food, and a mate and all other animals and humans formed that way? Huh? And for some reason it just doesn&#39;t happen anymore?? Also the Earth is actually much closer to a few THOUSAND years vs MILLIONS. There is much evidence to support that also. The population growth is great evidence. If the earth was really millions of years old, then there would be way more people and animals right now in the world..  Also, a BIG fact, that many, including myself are deceived of as children is; dinosaurs/dragons did NOT go extinct before humans were created, they lived with people, Mayans drew them on their clay pots with the texture of their skin visible. They wouldn&#39;t have known what type of skin something had, just by finding some bones in the ground. The Chinese calender does not have 11 real animals and one fake (dragon) it was a real animal and lived with people just like the rest of the animals. The word, &quot;dinosaur&quot; wasn&#39;t even invented until the 1800s before then, they have always been referred to as dragons. Who says they are extinct? Reptiles, never stop growing, so basically they were just, old giant lizard&#39;s. Or some cultures called them terrible lizards...  Vikings, put fake dragons on their ships to try and scare away the real ones living in the oceans. Kent Hovind points out these and much more of the scientific evidence to prove the facts surrounding dinosaurs and humans living with each other and the missing pieces that don&#39;t add up to prove evolution is true! If you really believe in science or want to see evidence to prove things I mentioned, I encourage you to check him out. It will blow your mind how much evidence is out there!

I couldn&#39;t even bring my kids to the playground in the evenings because the mosquitoes would attack me immediately;  I would literally go back home with 5-10 bites.  As soon as I started eating the garlic the mosquitoes bites STOPPED !!! Literally.  2 summers ago  I went to the park around 11pm and sat on the bench,  reading from my cell phone. I immediately noticed there were so many mosquitoes swarming around the front of my phone ( due to the light ),  that I had difficulty reading from my phone. I then realized I wasn&#39;t even getting bitten,  not once. They would land on me,  and immediately fly away without biting me. Mosquitoes are repulsed by Garlic,  this is why they won&#39;t bite you. \r<br>\r<br>This is what to do:\r<br>\r<br>1) Cut of 1 clove of garlic very finely. \r<br>2) Let it sit for 15 minutes ( this allows the chemicals in the garlic to mix )\r<br>3) Scoop up the garlic with a spoon and swallow it with a glass of water.\r<br>4) Do this 4-5 days a week. \r<br>\r<br>Note:  Don&#39;t chew the garlic or your breath will smell.

God is the creator of everything . Evolution has been disproved and a lot of biblical proof has been hidden and covered up by evolutionists. I will always believe in the almighty God. I have seen proof of God in my own life and others. I don\u2019t have time to list all that God has done for me and how much He loves me. Satan has blinded and lied to so many ppl. That\u2019s what he does. He hates us, he is so jealous that God created us in His image and loves us so very much. He thinks \u201cwho are these nothings to be made more important than I, the most beautiful angel\u201d? Just as in humans, pride has ruined many angels as well. A third of all the angels in heaven followed Satan when he left and are now demons causing a lot of problems in our lives. The sin of pride has got to be the worst sin. It leads to so much worse and destroys our lives. And it\u2019s pride that makes these evolutionists believe in a huge lie. All u have to do is look around you and see proof everywhere of a great creator. Only a brainless idiot believes a Big Bang just happened. And we all evolved from fish. How idiotic is that? Someone made all this. The entire universe didn\u2019t just \u201chappen\u201d. Everything in life is created. If the Big Bang was true, we wouldn\u2019t be made so perfect. It\u2019s just all too much to get into here. Before you get suckered into believing a lie, do your own research. You\u2019ll come to the same conclusion i did. A wonderful and loving holy God made all of this . And He loves us so very much . Even after all we have done and the atrocities humans have done over time , He still loves us. This love is from God, not evolution. We wouldn\u2019t be able to love if evolutionists were right and we would have kept evolving. We obviously are not evolving. To me, because i have the Holy Spirit living in me, I can see the truth so clearly. But you are blind. Ask God to open your eyes and heart, ask Him to come into your heart and watch what happens. But ask with love and not mocking. God knows your heart and you better than u know yourself.

Isn\u2019t all evolution a mistake that was favorable to the individual? For example, a mutation where a fish lays way more eggs than another fish of the same species. That was a mistake, there was no intentionality behind it, but it was favorable to that individual. More of the offspring of that individual survive and are likely to have inherited that egg mutation and lay a lot more eggs too. That leads to more of these fish with that mutation so that mutation spreads more.<br><br>The same can be said of this attractiveness mutation. It was highly likely to be a mistake (I can\u2019t see how a mutation would be intentional but do explain if I\u2019m missing something) but a highly favorable mutation because you are less likely to contract malaria and die and since you live longer, you have a higher chance of producing offspring who inherit that mutation.

Ive observed in my own social/familial circles a class of folks who experience frequent sensations of being bitten by mosquitoes, and/or prolonged intense itching, and even uncommonly intense swelling, who coincidentally perceive a high personal level of attractiveness to mosquitoes...while at the same time observing peoples in same party equally beset by, slapping, &amp; smashing swarming mosquitoes (and thus likely feeding the mosquitoes in similar amounts) who experience relatively minimal sensation of being bitten/minimal itching/barely noticeable swelling. They tend to classify themselves as less attractive to mosquitoes, when empirical observation seems to point to the conclusion they are equally as attractive. Takeaway: The physiology of the reaction to the bight may significantly influence the perception of one\u2019s attractiveness to mosquitoes, even though the level of attraction from the mosquitos\u2019 perspectives may potentially not vary at all.", "comment_date": "2019-09-28T07:00:33Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Science Builds", "comment_text": "I get bitten so much", "comment_date": "2019-09-28T00:00:17Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Giovanni P", "comment_text": "Remember when we leave Earth we are not fkn taking mosquitos with us lol", "comment_date": "2019-09-26T19:39:34Z", "likes_count": 2}, {"comment_by": "Helperbot 2000", "comment_text": "&quot;mosquitoe man&quot; XD", "comment_date": "2019-09-26T16:08:06Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Hitesh Patel", "comment_text": "thanks...", "comment_date": "2019-09-26T12:43:09Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "John Palmer", "comment_text": "Why Are Mosquitoes Attracted To You?!,,,,BECAUSE THEY&#39;RE BLOOD SUCKERS!!!", "comment_date": "2019-09-25T06:07:03Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Paul Neilson", "comment_text": "They don&#39;t like cinnamon.

But hey, at least we&#39;re not grasshoppers - they have that nasty parasitic worm which invades their brain and makes them seek out water and drown themselves, becoming food for the offspring.<br><br>I spent 8 years in the tropics and almost never got bitten by mosquitos even when others were spectacularly riddled with bites.  Interesting, I also clot VERY quickly - so I&#39;ve always wondered whether my skin/blood smell indicates that I&#39;m a little too &#39;clotty&#39; to be a safe meal.<br><br>It would be interesting to know whether any of the 7 DNA markers also correlate with clotting or clotting disorders... indicating the possible evolution of the mosquito to that particular trait, rather than the other way around.<br><br>My best friend was a heavy smoker and when he&#39;d come visit he&#39;d rarely get bitten too.  He visited after being smoke-free for several months and got eaten alive ; )  So, it seems that skin changes in smokers might deter mosquitos too... or at least, may help mask certain smells.<br><br>I&#39;d love to see a video on the interesting work being done with genetically modified females.  Apparently they are breeding and releasing genetically infertile females in huge numbers and this has been fairly effective in reducing populations in a way that is difficult for mosquitoes to adapt to.  Because the GM females are non-viable it&#39;s considered a safe application of GM.

In the case of their proof of DNA being the basis using twins as their example, redox potential would likely be around the same as well for twins and as such could still very likely be the real basis. Higher redox potential translates to a lower chance to be bitten and lower redox potential equates to a higher bite chance. Low redox potential also translates to a lot of other problems and health risks too, so it seems reasonable that mosquitoes could be a byproduct of that as well.<br>I know from experience that Native Americans are not as prone to being bitten by mosquitoes. I used to have some friends that were Native Americans and they never got bit while I got eaten alive. That could be argued as being a genetic DNA based trait passed on to them, but it could also still be redox potential as that gets passed on through the mother by way of the mitochondrial DNA. So, in a sense, I am saying it isn&#39;t DNA based and is instead based on redox potential while at the same time that too has a basis in the DNA so it&#39;s kind of both :)<br>The main difference though is that redox potential isn&#39;t as fixed as DNA is. It is possible to increase ones redox potential. It is also possible to lower it too, so that could explain some people phasing back and forth on their attractiveness to mosquitoes. The absolute worst thing for redox potential is Fluoride. This is a fact known in chemistry and has nothing to do with any other claims anyone may make about fluoride, though it&#39;s likely those claims are true too. It&#39;s bad stuff.

Random DNA changes made some people less attractive to mosquitoes. Those people are less likely to die from things like malaria, hence less likely to be taken out of the gene pool. Can&#39;t pass on your DNA if you&#39;re dead. Hence, people who are bitten less are more likely to propagate those genes in areas where mosquitoes are a mortality risk.<br><br>In climates where mosquitoes are less common I&#39;m sure you&#39;d find the native population is far less likely to have those mosquito repellent SNPs because the environment didn&#39;t select for those genes.<br><br>What&#39;s more interesting to me personally is that I&#39;ve recently realised I no longer hear mosquitoes.

It is more likely that some random set of malaria parasites were initially having some mutation that made humans produce more mosquito-attracting-odor. So these humans got bitten more times than the others, and this specific set of parasites eventually spread much more and much faster than all other sets of parasites. Which eventually died.<br><br>I wouldn&#39;t see a malicious action from the parasite, more the natural randomness of natural selection. Same with viruses and bacteria. They&#39;re not really bad, they&#39;re just there and happen to have had mutations in their past that made them survive longer than other less effective organisms that didn&#39;t make it until today.

The way in which the question was framed was as if to suggest that either A) Humans willfully evolved this trait as a response to the dangers that mosquitoes represent, or B) that it was merely a happy accident. This represents a fundamental lack of understanding regarding how evolution works. The answer to the question is most likely &quot;both are true&quot;, at least partially with regards to the first option. <br><br>The way it works is that the &quot;happy accidents&quot; occur in some portion of the population naturally and at random. Over time as children that are more and more appealing to mosquitoes are infected and ultimately fail to achieve breeding age, fewer and fewer of those traits are passed on to subsequent generations and thus, those that are unappealing to mosquitoes gain a distinct advantage in terms of successfully breeding and passing along the genes. <br><br>The question should never be posed as if to suggest that an adaptation was a response to a threat, as it almost certainly never works that way. Some adaptations can grant advantages to one creature over another in a given environment which then gives them a greater advantage in mate selection, and ultimately reproducing. To ask &quot;Did we evolve this trait in response to this event&quot; implies that at some level in our biology resides an intelligence that recognizes a threat and decides &quot;Right! Something needs to be done about this!&quot;.

Women often bath more, wear perfume, use hair care products, there are so many variables that would appear to seriously compromise the speculation that specific genes are responsible. That&#39;s like saying having a Y chromosome makes you more attractive to mosquitoes when in fact it might just be that men, who are historically (and evolutionarily) more: out doors, found slaughtered in battle fields, the ones out hunting in the tropics, further from fire, smellier, etc, are preferred to females or certain phenotypes. Seems like there are myriad variables that could discredit or support this conjecture. Were there any experiments run with animal subjects removing or mutating those genes?

While humans define(mentally) someone particularly more attractive mostly as that someone&#39;s level of fitness and that could serve as a marker for good candidate to pass down genes. If we could take is into analogy, maybe mosquitoes has these particular fickle meal choice could be a part of their evolutionary advantage as some meals can grant more protein and other nutrients amply before going full and waiting for another blood run. Near the end, you mentioned that the Plasmodium malariae(and its brethren species) parasites are able to biologically influence the dynamics of their host&#39;s body to actually appear more attractive towards mosquitoes(basically playing a major part in they symbiosis).

More people die from falling out of bed or from vending machines falling on them than from shark attacks.  Yet you never see a movie or documentary or TV news segment about how dangerous beds or vending machines are!
