So I was amazed all the time I heard that from him, so I did everything he said only to see that at the very day which he said I will be cured and should go for a test to confirm my status, I went to hospital for the final test and the doctor after running the test said I&#39;m HIV Negative wow. I&#39;m very amazed and happy about this cure i have really gone through so much pain and tears for this Dr.Harvey cured me with the help of his natural Herbs.If you have anybody going through this same situation or any kind of cancers or Diseases at all contact Dr Harvey today he cures them all save a life today.

It may seem that these could be the results of day-to-day stress and busyness, but there may be another culprit. All of these are symptoms of electro-sensitivity, which is something more and more people are finding themselves affected by. Studies done in 1997 have found \u201cless than a few cases (of electro-sensitivity) per million\u201d, however now as much as 2.5% of the population find themselves affected by electro-sensitivity. Even by most moderate calculations, electro-sensitivity is 1,000 times more common now than it was 20 years ago. Why could this be?<br><br>Electro-sensitivity and its symptoms seem to be triggered by certain microwave frequencies of electromagnetic radiation. Microwaves are frequently used in electronics for the purposes of communication between devices. Due to their high frequency, microwaves allow for higher transmission rates and small antenna sizes, which is perfect for high-tech devices that are constantly getting smaller and faster.

He first brings up &quot;how can cell phones cause cancer if it&#39;s non-ionizing radiation&quot; then proceeded to debunk his own argument by simply introducing the brain tumor argument. I would like to point out the difference of chances raising and rates. While the chances of you getting the tumor remain low, the rates at which these glioma tumors are appearing is increasing. Next is the studies. There have been many studies on rats using DAILY exposure levels. These studies lasted for allot less longer than what we are exposed to and the rats where found to show damage from as low as .1mw. Next is the case studies. While I don&#39;t know how the studies he sourced found their data, other studies that have found &quot;no links&quot; cut out the biggest chunk of glioma patients, elderly. Multiple other independent studies that have found causation would have found this negative resault if they too cut out old people. I feel this point was very Cherry picked. Another thing he brings up is OVERALL brain cancer rates. This is where the devil is hiding. Yes overall brain cancer is going down, however glioma is actually on the rise, hidden in the lowering trend of the statistic. That&#39;s like saying you shouldn&#39;t be worried about obesity killing you because humans overall lifespan has been increasing.<br>A few more points I would like to add that are more misc than anything<br>The microwave radiation causes damage to the blood brain barrier which leads to many problems. Not only do we get exposure from our phones, but everything else that emits this radiation. Your tablet, smart TV, wireless router, game system ect. It&#39;s not only the phones and towers that produce these signals. In the U.S and many other countries, there are regulations to how much radiation the public can be exposed to. And the biggest points against this video is... Go into your phone settings, go to the legal info, then click RF information and take a good look through there. Notice that it recommends you don&#39;t hold your phone close to your head. Next is that some health insurance companies don&#39;t provide coverage for tumors caused by RF radiation.<br><br>Edit: The Australian study that he referenced was the same one I was talking about.

Also as many know EMR is a constant factor especially for urban areas so I think the probability of someone getting cancer from EMR exposure, from sources that are suppose to be non-ionising is more dependant on their biology and any weaknesses they may have. This is only my opinion and I have no evidence \ud83d\ude02.

The latency argument is based on the fact that people usually dont get skin cancer until they are in their 50, 30 years after their teen years when they are in the sun a lot,  but that ignores the fact that skin cancer from the sun is based on genetic susceptibility, and the damage isn&#39;t done from the first time you go out into the sun but when your DNA develops damage which can takes decades, but once that damage occurs cancer grows very quickly.  Your a hundred times more likely to get cell damage from the sun&#39;s radiation than from cell phone radiation.", "comment_date": "2019-02-26T22:24:46Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "River Trash", "comment_text": "We rarely have the phone by our ear nowadays due to texting, FaceTime and the many other things people use to communicate.<br><br>However most of us have a phone in our pocket or lap for the majority of the time we&#39;re awake, so what about testicular and/or ovarian cancer?", "comment_date": "2019-02-24T08:24:31Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Twobarpsi", "comment_text": "What language are they speaking in this video?", "comment_date": "2019-02-22T05:42:24Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Saswat Sarangi", "comment_text": "<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wU5XkhUGzBs&amp;t=3m34s\">3:34</a> who&#39;s the girl", "comment_date": "2019-02-19T14:45:31Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Saswat Sarangi", "comment_text": "But still if wavelength is same as a microwave that means same frequency, frequency leads to energy , the energy that boils in oven , boils brain???

The human body is a complex system with countless apparently random and unpredictable interactions that we haven&#39;t even begun to understand, because there are so many variables and we can&#39;t do controlled experiments on the general population. So to suggest that we know definitively all the effects on the human body of exposure to a given thing is disingenuous. There&#39;s not a single thing we are exposed to that we know, for sure, is completely without risk; just look at the ever-changing headlines about which foods will give you cancer or extend your life if you don&#39;t believe me. It&#39;s possible to isolate a specific thing as being definitely toxic or carcinogenic, if the signal is strong enough, but a lack of a detectable signal doesn&#39;t rule out a possible detrimental effect that is simply not frequent enough - or not immediate enough - to definitively pin on the thing being investigated. This is especially true for carcinogens, which appear harmless in the short term only to result in inexplicable tumors decades into the future, obscuring any obvious chain of causation. In fact, independent (ie not funded by the wireless industry) research, based on actual experiments exposing rats to cell phone radiation, DOES strongly suggest that it causes cancer (at least in rats). Now we can scratch our heads and wonder how it does that, because we always thought that non-ionizing radiation wasn&#39;t strong enough to cause cell damage. But we would be fools to dismiss the findings as irrelevant simply because we already know them to be impossible.<br><br>Second, the very question of whether cell phones cause brain cancer is a red herring. Cell phones do not emit radiation only when you&#39;re holding them next to your head. Today&#39;s smart phones, especially, are constantly talking to nearby cell towers (not to mention GPS satellites) unless they are turned off or in airplane mode. Most of that time, your phone is not against your head - it&#39;s in your pocket, or in your lap, or in your hands in front of you. So what makes people think that brain cancer is the main thing you need to worry about a cell phone causing? I&#39;ve thought for years that the most likely effect these phones are having on people is reproductive, since most people carry them in their pants pockets, meaning your genital region is absorbing the brunt of any radiation leaking off your phone during the 10+ hours a day you&#39;re carrying it around. And don&#39;t forget about the hours you&#39;re asleep. How many people put their phone in airplane mode for the night? Versus the number who sleep with it next to their bed, just inches away from their body? <br><br>One thing Derek is right about - it&#39;s nearly impossible to do a real controlled study on the general population, because cell phones are so ubiquitous. Even if you don&#39;t own one, you likely spend a good portion of your day near other people&#39;s phones, either at work, or on public transportation, or when socializing with friends and family. (Just try asking someone you&#39;re with if they woudln&#39;t mind moving their phone so that it&#39;s not inches away from you (or your child) and watch the blank looks they give you; it&#39;s as if you&#39;re speaking a different language. I wonder if this is the reaction you would have gotten in the 50s if you&#39;d asked someone to take their cigarette outside.) But you can still do studies on lab animals. Now you can argue that causing cancer in rats don&#39;t necessarily translate to causing cancer in humans, and in general that&#39;s true. But I go by the precautionary principle. Absence of proof isn&#39;t proof of absence - especially when <b>evidence</b> is in such abundance.<br><br>While I&#39;m glad some people are finally starting to speak out against the wireless industry&#39;s whitewashing spokesmen, who follow in the footsteps of Big Tobacco and Big Oil in sowing doubt about the growing evidence of the disastrous side effects (cancer and climate change, respectively) of their industries, I&#39;m always astounded by the willingness of otherwise intelligent people, including scientists, to dismiss seemingly rational concerns about the health effects of untested new products as fear mongering and hysteria, when there is such an obvious financial incentive behind the reassurances of safety by those selling the product. Do we really love our phones that much, that we&#39;re willing to cover our own eyes and tell ourselves everything <b>must</b> be ok? Or are we terrified of admitting to ourselves that we might have already done irreparable damage to our bodies and our children&#39;s bodies? Or do we just need to have faith in our institutions, to believe that our government is protecting us, and that regulatory agencies are doing their jobs and haven&#39;t been captured by the industries on the other side of that revolving door?<br><br>I would love to hear an update on this, given that old research is finally seeing the light of day. As always, the hallmark of science is being able to reassess one&#39;s previously held assumptions in the light of new evidence and admit that one might have been wrong.", "comment_date": "2018-05-02T04:44:52Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "jonard jallorina", "comment_text": "w8 so does cellphone cause brain cancer?", "comment_date": "2018-04-20T01:27:22Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Otaku Boi", "comment_text": "You can turn your Phone onto Airplane Mode to prevent any serious radiation \ud83d\ude00Hopefully this helped someone!", "comment_date": "2018-03-22T21:48:59Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Jack Handy", "comment_text": "Okay, think about this...we are told not to put metal in the microwave due to the metal reflecting the microwaves back.

One possibility to prove this point definitively is to use animals that have intermediate lifespans (10 to 15 years) and expose them regularly to cell phone-like radiation looking for possible side effects.

The study essentially finds that electromagnetic fields (both RF and EMF) have tumor-promoting effects caused by metabolic changes due to exposure. This paper was replication of a previous study done on mices, and confirms that those effect are visible also at exposure levels well below the limits enforced by the FCC for mobile phones.

Or ignore the fact, that there are no superficial category &quot;mobile phones&quot;, they are all different using different kind of technology emitting different amounts of radiation on different wavelenghts, like there is GSM, 3g, 4g.<br>I bet everyone knows the sound coming out of your speakers just the moment before you recieve a call or SMS. Its your mobile phone inducing current in the circuits of your speakers by the short burst of radiation needed to establish the connection for data transmission. Its that simple, EM Field change result in charged particles set in motion in the wire of the speaker. But wait. There are charged particles in our brains. In fact, its how our brain functions. There are charged particles moving from one side of membrane to another causing a chain reaction which transmits the signal forward. This is by the way what induces our brains EM field, which we can measure. It goes both ways: charged particles moving create EM field, EM field change, causes charged particles to move.<br>So answer me the question and tell me what you think. Could living in an enviroment with dozens of wifi hotspots, telecom masts and mobile phones around you cause changes in our brains after a long term exposure? Could 4g be the reason the western world (russia also have 4g standart) went nuts in the past 2-3 years with cold war happening again? Could this be the reason for more people than ever suffering from depressions, inability to concentrate, mood swings and being chronicaly tired? Dont forget, we live in a world, you can power a light bulb just from the energy wifi hotspots are emitting. If this radiation can make a bulb glow, it may affect our brains.
