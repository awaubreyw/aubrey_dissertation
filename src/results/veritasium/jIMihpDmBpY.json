Thunderf00t didn&#39;t actually prove Derek wrong, most of his experiments do not contradict the induction explanation. His first explicit contradictive argument (around 11.30) does not actually contradict (I left a long comment on that at Thunderf00t&#39;s video). Using distilled water does not contradict, since even ultra pure water is still a tiny bit conductive, which is actually already enough for the minuscule charges to be moved around to get electrostatic equilibrium (so higher conductivity does not even help). The most compelling effect (and most difficult to explain with induction) is that with the capillary at the end, but that still can be explained by induction. The part of the few centimeters long water column nearer to the charged plastic container gets more opposite charges attracted within that water column due to induction, ions of same charge are repelled to the other end, and then you get attraction for the near end.<br><br>More interesting: Some of Thunderf00t&#39;s experiments even actually disprove his own explanation:<br>Why is the continuous beam attracted and the droplets are not (17.40)? You have polar water in both cases, and if polarization is the cause, both should be attracted. So what&#39;s the difference between the continuous stream and the separated droplets? The continuous stream can conduct electricity along the stream; as soon as the water is separated into drops, it can&#39;t. Thus conductivity along the stream makes the difference between the effect working or not. Polarization is not affected by that. Electrostatic induction is. Thus electromagnetic induction is the main cause for water bending. <br>Funny enough, Thunderf00t even shows Derek&#39;s reply to Thunderf00t&#39;s previous video (0.45), where Derek uses that same argument, which Thunderf00t completely seems to ignore.", "comment_date": "2022-02-06T21:49:39Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "safetydown", "comment_text": "@Thunderf00t video brought me here 2022", "comment_date": "2022-02-06T18:58:29Z", "likes_count": 6}, {"comment_by": "FX", "comment_text": "thunderf00t busted this video again, but this time he went full on, he didn&#39;t hold back this time and brought his weapons too lmaoo", "comment_date": "2022-02-06T17:57:25Z", "likes_count": 5}, {"comment_by": "Bogdan Shevchenko", "comment_text": "Watch recent thunderlbolt video on water.

A conductor shields out electrostatic fields from its interior by carrying currents that set up surface charges,  so there&#39;ll be an opposite charge layer on the near side of the water facing the cup, attracting it. Current doesn&#39;t actually need to flow all the way back to the faucet, though if it can, the net force can be increased.  Only very small currents are needed to set up these net charge layers.  Remember that the Coulomb is a very big unit of charge, and resulting force!!  <br>Water is also strongly dielectric,  with a dielectric constant of around 80 at low frequencies (below 100MHz or so).  At the water surface a polarization charge layer appears, again attractive on the near surface and repulsive on the far surface, so with the field gradient across the entire droplet a net attractive force arises. (This indeed results from the polarization of the the individual molecules.  In the interior of a droplet there is no net charge, negative and positive sides of the polarized molecules are next to each other, while on the surface there is an unbalanced charge layer of the outermost polarized molecules.) <br>So both mechanisms can operate.  It is not obvious which may dominate in a given situation, it depends on how conductive the water is.  Probably with tap water conductive shielding dominates, while with very highly deionized water, or other highly non-conductive and strongly dielectric liquids, the dielectric surface charge may dominate.", "comment_date": "2020-10-29T18:06:22Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "OmgIT\u2019s Skie", "comment_text": "So next week I\u2019m setting a tea bag on fire", "comment_date": "2020-10-26T22:42:19Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Subhankar Palit", "comment_text": "Thanks", "comment_date": "2020-10-26T12:44:22Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Megadextrious", "comment_text": "Oh whoa what cereal is that?

The way that I believe this works is that, through water&#39;s inter molecular forces via hydrogen bonding, large water &quot;droplets&quot; (relatively large they are still very very small) form together where, just like a magnet, each side is either positive or negatively charged, due to the dipoles of all the water molecules combining. So, with this droplet of water, the positive end would be attracted to the negative cup more than the negative side would be propelled because the positive side is closer; this is the same way the &quot;positive&quot; side of a magnet moves towards the positive side of another magnet, since the attraction of the magnet&#39;s negative side is stronger than the magnets repulsion.

I place an uncharged cylinder on a flat surface.  Then I charge up one of my objects and place it close to the cylinder.  The cylinder is always attracted to the charged object.  This works for an aluminum can, which suggests that the charge shifts in the conducting aluminum.  But a charged object also attracts a non conducting cylinder like a wooden spool or a cork.  <br><br><br>I explain this as the charged object slightly polarizing the atoms nearest the charge and the charge that is repeled from the object is diminished compared to the opposite charge that is attracted to the charged on the object. In other words, the part of the polarized neutral object that is pushed away from the like charge on the charged object has less effect due to increased distance.  The part of the polarized charge that is attracted to the charged object dominates because it is slightly closer and hence greater force.  I hope that is correct.  If not please do a video to explain how a neutral nonconducting object can be attracted to a second object that is highly charged.  I claim this is also why a balloon that is charged by rubbing it on hair or cloth will stick to a neutral wall.

Heat, electricity, magnetism is all from the same markup. Every atom has electrons. Electricity can be created by magnetism, electricity can create magnetism (electromagnetism), electricity can create heat. Heat can create electricity. Magnetism are released by heat. And by the way there are no evidence of any gravity. That an object is falling is due gravity, is false, it is due to magnetism. &quot;A magnet forms when the magnetic dipoles in a material orient in the same general direction.&quot; - How to demagnetize a magnet written by Anne Marie Hlemenstine, Ph.D. The magnetic dipoles are directional, and everything has it. The more one way direction the magnetic dipoles are, the more magnetic it gets. In everything the magnetic dipoles are scrambled and locked into place, but this can be changed. Take a nail, and use a hammer, then hammer the nail directionally it will get magnetic. Heating past the curie point, applying a strong magnetic field, preassure or AC current will re-scramble the magnetic dipoles and it will lose the magnetic state. Since they are teaching it is heat in the center of the Earth, then it can&#39;t be magnetic and cause any &quot;gravity&quot;. Then the magnetic source must be somewhere else than the center of the Earth, and it must be massive. And if it is not in the center of the Earth, the Earth can not be the globe we are taught to belive.<br><br>When it comes to the stick. You are balancing it on both fingers till you get the weight center. So if you measure the distance form you finger to both ends it would differ. When you are just taking hold of the center of the stick, you are just focusing on the length of the stick and disregarding that the object may have higher weight on some of the sides from your finger, so it falls due to it is more heavy on one of the sides.", "comment_date": "2018-05-29T18:39:59Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Nitish Makkar", "comment_text": "Does the distilled water will also show deflection.

Surface tension creates an organized molecular structure on the surface that can present a more positive environment to the air side and is attracted to the ballon even if the net charge of the stream is zero. The polarity of water is dominated by the electronegativity of oxygen and since air is non-polar the dipole movement presents more positive charges to the surface.  Electric conductivity and grounding makes is so the charge of the stream is neutral but if a droplet forms it can hold a charge and is accelerated towards the ballon to a larger extent that the stream. All of these concepts are difficult to grasp because water has such a low molecular weight and such a large dipole movement and this makes it have extreme properties like being a liquid at 25C.

I&#39;m not convinced that the levitation is due simply to buoyancy/convection. Yes, the buoyancy and convection is definitely what sets up the flow, and the density of the teabag ash needs to get low enough so that the fluid dynamic forces can overcome the force of gravity, but I think entrainment plays a large role here too. After all the tea bag (ash) isn&#39;t really encasing any hot air, and the bag/ash itself isn&#39;t any less dense than the surrounding air. Rather, the combustion of the teabag sets up a buoyant jet. This jet builds momentum traveling upwards, and air on the surface of the plate/table get&#39;s drawn towards the flame to replace the buoyant air thats rising away from it. Once the bag has mostly combusted and turned to ash it has a large enough surface area and low enough weight that the rising buoyant jet  can entrain it in the flow. This flow will persist even for a short while after the fire has gone out due to momentum of the buoyant jet.

I believe that your explanation for the deflection of water is misleading. It&#39;s certainly true that a charged cup will repel one kind of ion and attract the other, leading to a net attractive force, but this is not necessary for the attraction to occur. Even if the water were completely deionized, the cup&#39;s surface charges (say they&#39;re negative) will repel the electron clouds in the water molecules and attract the atomic nuclei, polarizing the water molecules. This polarization will occur until all of the forces are in equilibrium , but the net effect is still an uneven charge distribution that will be attracted to the cup. It doesn&#39;t matter whether the water molecules were polar before, and even though this induced dipole is much greater than the preexisting one,the bottom line is that this phenomenon will be observed regardless of the molecules&#39; polarity or the presence of ions in solution.", "comment_date": "2015-05-07T15:56:32Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Phan Trash", "comment_text": "I actually knew the cereal one right away.

Here it goes.<br><br>1) Consider Derek and the stick as the system. There are three things in the system whose motion is to be described, they are, the left and the right hands and the stick. The initial momentum of the system of elements is zero. Everything is at rest initially. Since no external forces act on the system, momentum is conserved. This implies, the final momentum of the system of elements is zero. At the final configuration, the momentum of the left and the right hands is zero because they stop at the point where they meet. This leaves us with the stick, whose momentum has to be zero. The stick may possess both translational momentum and rotational momentum. Since the two momenta cannot be added( due to the absence of dimensional homogeneity ), both should equal to zero. Coming to rotational momentum or angular momentum, which is zero, there is no flipping or rotational motion. Since it continues to stay in that configuration( constant angular velocity that is equal to zero ), we say that the net torque about the pivot( Derek&#39;s fingers ) is zero. By definition, the net torque about the center of mass of an isolated element is always zero and in this case, the system as mentioned above is isolated. This implies that the center of mass of the stick rests on Derek&#39;s fingers.<br><br>3) The electric field created by the charged insulating cup is not uniform. To be clear, take a cylindrical cup( almost identical to the one in the video ) with its bottom surface missing and let it have a uniform surface charge density. On calculating the electric field intensity at any point in space( using Gauss&#39;s law for this special symmetric situation ), one will observe that the electric field intensity follows an inverse &#39;r&#39; relationship where &#39;r&#39; is the distance from the central axis of the cylinder. As a consequence, the net force on the water molecule will not be zero. The net force on the molecule causes it to deflect from its initial flow direction. So, in this case even pure water deflects.

The center of gravity (cg) is were the weight is expressed. Using statics the sum of all the y components and the sum of the moments about a certain point must equal zero. The sum of all the y components cannot be solved without the sum of the moments, there are two unknowns and two equations. Thus, the solution to the cane problem is solved with the moments about a certain point. A moment is force x moment arm or length from the cg. At any point the moment arm is a known factor thus the moments about the cg must be equal to maintain equilibrium. The finger that is closest to the cg has to have more force on it because the moment arm is shorter (force x moment). The more force the more friction and thus the finger furthest away from the cg will slide. ~Cheers, love your videos!", "comment_date": "2014-08-14T00:25:43Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "dragnevar", "comment_text": "All i see is anal bead magnet", "comment_date": "2014-08-14T00:21:34Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "illdie", "comment_text": "I got the cane one right, and i didn&#39;t even try with the others", "comment_date": "2014-08-14T00:21:31Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Stephen Yamber", "comment_text": "Anyone who got them all right is a liar,and anyone who didn&#39;t is an idiot", "comment_date": "2014-08-14T00:15:45Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "SonnyChenova", "comment_text": "can you please explain the RIT&#39;s Escherian Staiwell? how is it possible?", "comment_date": "2014-08-14T00:09:33Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "felipe feitosa", "comment_text": "Seek for flying chimney in some IYPT articles ", "comment_date": "2014-08-14T00:07:32Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "felipe feitosa", "comment_text": "Seek for flying chimney in some IYPT articles ", "comment_date": "2014-08-14T00:07:31Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Stevenx01", "comment_text": "I think that the problem with the xPhone (added an &quot;x&quot; to prevent hidden advertising) is that its internal parts (I suppose) are not equally distributed.

Even small weights (in the scale of grams) can do much difference.<br><br>But that&#39;s just my two cents.", "comment_date": "2014-08-13T21:01:59Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Gregory McElhinney", "comment_text": "This is great!

So the simplest answer was correct - cereal contains iron. Also, I did not know that water is diamagnetic... But I somewhat pointed out that the surface of water might be &quot;dented&quot;, but I thought about it for the wrong reason. I should have done the experiment myself...<br>\u00a0<br>The cane was clear, i just wrote it unnecessary complicated and confusing, yet thinking exactly the same as was explained in this video. I could explain it easy in my native tongue though. :-P<br>\u00a0<br>I was wrong about the rotation of the phone. Simply wrong. I admit it.<br>\u00a0<br>I was (sort of) right about the deflecting water - static electricity (electrostatic induction) based on conductivity of water. But I forgot to mention that what makes water conductive are those free ions and impurities, I know that pure was is isolating. And I also did not fully realize the movement of the ions, I certainly did not think about them as &quot;go back up&quot; (like Derek said in the video) against the flow, I thought of them just as being &quot;stuck&quot; at some point, building up and causing the build-up of the electrostatic charge in the rest of the stream. So I got an answer that is closer to reality but with an incomplete and inaccurate explanation. Btw. I never heard that the deflection should be caused because water is a polar molecule. I first heard in in your video. At the same time I find this explanation wrong for the same reasons that were explained here.<br>\u00a0<br>The rising teabag was clear. Yes, hot air rises because it has a lower density, or higher energy - higher &quot;jiggling&quot; motion&quot;.<br>\u00a0<br>So, how many points did I get (out of max. 5)? Zero for the rotating phone.
