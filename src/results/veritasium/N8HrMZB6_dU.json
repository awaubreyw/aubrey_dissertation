Question.  <br><br>How long does the block have to be to make the off-center shot make it overcome the vertical force?  <br><br>The reason it goes up the same height is simple...  It&#39;s still close enough to center of mass that the energy is still able to NOT be redirected significantly into rotating the block.  The amount of force necessary to ROTATE a light wooden block around a nicely centered and squared up rotational fulcrum is MUUUUUCH smaller than the amount of force necessary to lift the whole block into the air.  I&#39;d bet good moneh that the rotating block is going up into the air a bare FRACTION of a millimeter, perhaps, less than the center-shot block.  If the block were significantly longer, then the rotation would be more pronounced and the jump into the air would be significantly lessened, depending on where you shot the block.", "comment_date": "2021-10-27T17:08:35Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "QSAnimazione", "comment_text": "this is a coincidence given by the materials chosen", "comment_date": "2021-10-27T16:42:33Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "sviccc", "comment_text": "Magnus effect helping?", "comment_date": "2021-10-27T15:16:52Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "InteliJencia Rara", "comment_text": "Maybe it&#39;s a Magnus effect going on?", "comment_date": "2021-10-27T15:13:32Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "bradrnstyle", "comment_text": "You discovered how aliens do it, by spinning their flying saucer.

The plexiglass structure sits on solid ground, so as the nail pushes downward against it, the effective result is the nail is helping to launch the block upward (just as anything that gives the earth a downward shove will itself experience an upward acceleration).  To prove my theory, you can do the experiment again, removing the plexiglass stand at the exact moment of bullet contact (I&#39;m not sure how this could be done).

Since I&#39;ve taken plenty of physics courses and studied engineering in college I knew this was not a problem at all, but someone decided to come try and chew me out because of that claiming that if my weapon was to fire accidentally the round (bullet) would fall somewhere and it could kill someone. <br><br>Here is my claim: There is no possible way that round could kill someone. The round itself weighs 68 grains. That&#39;s .155 oz. The equivalent of a pebble. You know, the things kids threw at each other on the playground in elementary school. <br>The round travels upward at 2700 ft/sec upon leaving the barrel. Gravity then begins to work on the round until all that velocity is shaved off and it reaches 0 ft/sec. The round begins to fall back to the earth but because of air resistance the round will not reach 2700 ft/sec again. It will reach what is called &quot;terminal velocity&quot;. It has no propulsion behind it anymore. just gravity pulling it down and air keeping it from continually increasing in velocity. The only way it could pass terminal velocity would be if the round rotated to point downward and the aerodynamics of the round allowed it to gain more velocity as a result. Still, there would be a terminal velocity because there is still air resistance despite aerodynamics. And that&#39;s assuming any kind of wind in the atmosphere on the way back down does not cause the round to rotate such that it is no longer pointing down. <br><br>A 5.56x45mm round from an M4 or M16 is not all that aerodynamic anyway. It is not a sniper round. It&#39;s maximum effective range is between 500-600 meters. The maximum range it will reach is 3600 meters. <br>considering the fact that it would take at least 600-800 feet per second to break skin and a round that size could not inflict enough kinect energy to cause a concussion or even a headache, there is no way (in my opinion) that round could kill when falling out of the sky. Unless the round is fired at an angle, then it has x velocity and has the potential to kill on impact. but when fired straight up into the air it will not have that x velocity. so all the velocity will bleed off as gravity pulls the round back down and it will reach terminal velocity on the way back down that is not enough to break skin and the mass of the round will not impact with enough kinetic energy to cause death. <br>So my claim remains that a round that size with not kill.

The force is off centre of mass that is suspended on a loose fulcrum and so when the identical force to block 1 is applied upwards 2 things happen. 1 ever so briefly the nlock spins on the nail resting through it&#39;s centre (almost instantly loses contact, but it occurs). 2. The major cause if spin; yhe force is applied off centre to mass and it pushes 1 dide higher than the other, this causes 1 side to accelerate faster as surpass the other side. Since they&#39;re connected, the top spins up and around the slower side(same as a car spinning out on a slippery corner). The force though doesn&#39;t just end there though. It continues it&#39;s course around the slower side that too is also has accelerated upwards but just at a slower rate. As the faster side comes back around again it&#39;s momentum throws it again higher. One may assume that this would be cancelled ad it comes back around the otherside and throws itself downward again.

Point a. 2 crests of momentum  amplifying movement upwards and point b. Of a node, wave a up and wave b down, close to canceling each other out.   ... and so as the block spins upwards, gravily accelerates each side as they spin on it&#39;s downward stroke and slows both as it spins again as they spin upward again, acting on the entire block as a whole, the entire time.

That means that some of the energy is lost to deformation and destruction of the wood fibers and the bullet, ultimately becoming heat. Since the off center block can respond to the collision by rotating away from the bullet&#39;s force, the bullet penetrates less deeply, and less energy is lost to inelastic heat. That energy difference goes into rotation.<br><br>Unlike kinetic and potential energy, which are <b>not</b> conserved when collisions are inelastic, (Think of dropping a ball of putty. All the energy goes into deforming the object.), momentum (the product of mass and velocity) is always conserved.

This means the energy from the bullet is absorbed and transferred through both the left and the right parts of the block equally. In the second experiment, when the bullet hits the right of the block, the right edge has more energy from the bullet and less absorption from the centre and less from the left , BUT suffers more resistence from the non penetrated centre, and twice the resistence from the left of the block. This means the mass that is NOT effected evenly from a central hit \u00a0effectively dulls the impact from the bullet on the right in a manner that is EQUALY \u00a0effecting the resistence from the positive force from the right.

If you apply the same force on the same block, you put the same energy. But when you hit it below the center, you make it spin real slowly because you put more torque in it. So the first block had this energy: translation energy which leads it to the maximal height, big torque and little rotation speed. When you multiply \u00a0the torque by the rotation speed it gives you power, and when you multiply it by \u00a0the little time it has been exposed to the pushing force from the bullet, you have the extra energy you&#39;re talking about. So basically you have spinning energy with big torque and little rotationnal speed, and translation energy with the maximal height for the first block.

So our second block has spinning energy with little torque and high rotationnal speed, and translation energy with the maximal height. The conclusion is: They have the same energy, but they it&#39;s transformed in a different way.
