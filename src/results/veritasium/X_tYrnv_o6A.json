I think it&#39;s phenomenal that scientists could work all this out in the last couple of decades but the most exciting thing is surely the knowledge how these living cells came about in the first place.  Random mechanisms, if there is such a thing, seem hardly sufficient to explain that. I cannot think of a single instant where sand on the oceans&#39; beaches has ever turned into anything even remotely resembling something  functional at the lowest imaginable level. Now that we get to understand the workings of the cell, we must ask ourselves how this came about and what the most compelling evidence is for any theory of its origin. Ignoring the question and simply going on describing the ever more complex cellular details and dependencies without raising the origins question is scientifically inadequate.", "comment_date": "2022-09-21T05:30:03Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Lloyd B", "comment_text": "It&#39;s telling that you didn&#39;t say anything about your belief that the information to build these perfect little machines came from random natural processes.

The longer they survive, the more chance they have to reproduce and pass on the genes that equipped them with slightly better eyesight. Some of their offspring might, in turn, have better eyesight than their parents, making it likelier that they, too, will reproduce. And so on. Generation by generation, over unfathomably long periods of time, tiny advantages add up. Eventually, after a few hundred million years, you have creatures who can see as well as humans, or cats, or owls. <br><br>This is the basic story of evolution, as recounted in countless textbooks and pop-science bestsellers. The problem, according to a growing number of scientists, is that it is absurdly crude and misleading. <br><br>The issue is with mere materialism, it doesn&#39;t address how it all came about,\u00a0 Instead seeks ridicule and the silencing of those that simply say GOD, avoiding of history and the Marxists agenda of scientism leading to totalitarianism that would inevitably\u00a0 force kids to denounce God publicly if they wanted to further their education. .\u00a0 Sounds like the same framework of todays America;<br>Just like the propaganda of the Iron Curtain, German Democratic Republic, and the People&#39;s Republic of China, Tianaman Square, the gulag, the killing fields of Cuba, silencing those that seek further than the natural, (human value) because the natural can&#39;t explain human value, consciousness, self awareness, reasoning, rationality, purpose, the pursuit of knowledge and overall LOVE. <br>These things the survivors of those countries came to America for.

Striking me as being a flagrant denial of common sense to swallow that all these things were built up by accumulative small random changes. This is simply a nonsensical claim, especially for the great majority of cases, where nobody can think of any credible explanation of how it came about. And this is a very profound question that everyone skirts, everybody brushes over, everybody tries to sweep under the carpet. The fact is that the majority of these complex adaptations in nature can&#39;t be adequately explained by a series of intermediate forms. And this is a fundamental problem. Common sense tells me that something is actually very wrong.&quot; <br><br>Bioinformatics indicate that someone/something added a TON of information to the Biospheres Genome during the Cambrian Explosion (a brief five-hundred-million-year-period when almost all known animal forms appeared suddenly) also according to fossil records.<br>Evolution as origin and speciation is an absolute joke, mathematically &quot;dozens of orders of magnitude too weak&quot; even using severely conservative assumptions.<br>James Webb is showing us new things that bring into question the theories of big bang; Like, other galaxies being far younger, ALL maintaining these incredibly smooth surfaces, structures, shapes, yet they expected to see other galaxies marred and mangled.

The fact that our own cells are so advanced we don&#39;t look at it as technology is proof that some people are not even sentient enough to understand they are created. Much like our most advanced AI that doesn&#39;t quite fully aware or conscience of it&#39;s true self.  The last part really frustrates me that we arrogantly think that one day we can design something that can heal the body better than the body itself? Do you really think that GOD couldn&#39;t make a design far more superior if that was GOD&#39;s intention? All created things have a finite purpose and  design for a specific job or mission. If we were to have immortal bodies in this life, GOD the CREATOR could have easily made it so. The fact is, we are only given bodies for a short life span (relatively speaking) sufficient for our souls to learn about FREE will and love, and other very important things which surpass the necessity to live on. Being that immortality can be endowed as a gift by none other than the creator when one is worthy to continue their LIFE which is carefully planned and directed by GOD.

But it has been predicted in the Bible long ago. Just see Rom 1, &quot;20For since the creation of the world God\u2019s invisible qualities\u2014his eternal power and divine nature\u2014have been clearly seen, being understood from what has been made, so that people are without excuse.\r<br>\r<br>21 For although they knew God, they neither glorified him as God nor gave thanks to him, but their thinking became futile and their foolish hearts were darkened.&quot;\r<br>At least the true scientists and heroes of the past centuries, like Sir Isaac Newton and Johannes Kepler, who were some of the greatest scientists that ever lived, understood this. Johannes Kepler said, &quot;I was merely thinking God&#39;s thoughts after him&quot;. Sir Isaac Newton said, &quot;This most beautiful system of the sun, planets, and comets, could only proceed from the counsel and dominion of an intelligent Being&quot;\r<br>And amazingly, even the current hero of evolution, Richard Dawkins, at least acknowledge that he willingly deny God, just as Rom 1 says. In \u201cThe God Delusion Debate\u201d at the university of Alabama with dr Lennox, at 1 : 40 : 45 Dawkins states, \u201cWhen we go into a garden and we see how beautiful it is, and we see the coloured flowers and we see the butterflies and the bees, of course it is natural to think there must be a gardener. Any fool is likely to think there must be a gardener. The huge achievement of Darwin was to show that that didn\u2019t have to be true\u2026 It seems so obvious that if you have a garden there must be a gardener who created it and all that goes with that. What Darwin did was to show the staggeringly counter-intuitive fact that this not only can be explained by an undirected process \u2026  \u201d - so he clearly states that &quot;it seems so obvious that there must be a Gardener who created it&quot;, and that it is &quot;staggeringly counter-intuitive to explain it by an undirected evolutionary process&quot;. And yet he excludes the most obvious solution and tries to explain it with evolutionary fairy-tales.\r<br>However the evolutionary fairy-tales is a very poor argument. By excluding the most probable explanation from consideration he is committing a fatal error. Imagine if mathematicians go about maths that way, excluding the most intuitive solution and then trying to solve the problem. Obviously if the correct solution is excluded before you try to solve it, you will never get the problem solved.\r<br>This thought was excellently expressed in the comment section of an article I\u2019ve read, \u201cIt is both perfectly logical and wholly scientific to conclude that, when design is clearly in evidence, then there must be a designer.

It has built additional ground stations and has received permission from the Federal Communications Commission to operate (so far) 40 ground stations, scattered throughout the United States. It has signed up customers to begin \u201cbeta testing\u201d of the satellites that are already in orbit. Beta testing will occur initially, says SpaceX, with customers who live between 44 and 52 degrees latitude in the northern U.S. and southern Canada. SpaceX plans to begin the testing sometime in September.<br><br>As I reported in a previous newsletter, SpaceX\u2019s launch of April 22, which brought the number of its satellites up to 420, was accompanied by reports of heart palpitations from far and wide, including from yours truly. I again felt strong heart palpitations that began early in the morning on August 7. Actually I began to experience a feeling of oppression Thursday night about two hours before the launch time. Please contact me if you have been having heart palpitations since Friday\u2019s launch.<br><br>OneWeb<br><br>OneWeb, which is based in the UK, and which had declared bankruptcy in March, has been bailed out to the tune of one billion dollars by the UK government and Indian telecommunications company Bharti Global. And on May 26, 2020, OneWeb applied to the FCC for permission to compete on an equal footing with SpaceX by launching 47,844 satellites into the ionosphere.<br><br>Although OneWeb\u2019s offices are in the UK, none of its Directors live there. Its CEO, Adri\u00e1n Steckel, is Mexican, and the rest of its Directors live in the U.S., Germany, Israel and Mexico. Its major stockholders are Qualcomm (Singapore), SoftBank Group (Japan), and 1110 Ventures (U.S.).<br><br>Amazon<br><br>On July 29, 2020, the FCC granted Amazon\u2019s application to launch 3,236 satellites into the ionosphere. Like the satellites of SpaceX and OneWeb, Amazon\u2019s satellites will operate at millimeter wave frequencies and use phased array technology to cover the Earth with focused beams of radiation enabling customers to access the Internet from anywhere on Earth, on land or ocean.<br><br>The satellites of SpaceX, OneWeb and Amazon alone, if they are all launched, will total, together, about 92,000 satellites. If you add in Iridium and Globalstar, which are already operating small constellations, and the plans of Facebook, Link, Canadian companies Kepler and Telesat, the China Aerospace Science and Industry Corporation, Russia\u2019s Roscosmos, and other competitors, there could soon be 100,000 satellites orbiting in the ionosphere.<br><br>\u201cBut will you wake for pity\u2019s sake\u201d*<br><br>The out-of-control satellite industry is one of the stupidest things humankind has ever created. It treats the life-giving envelope of our atmosphere as if we don\u2019t depend on it. It poses an immediate threat to life on Earth, in so many ways.<br><br>The 100,000 planned 5G satellites, each with a designed lifespan of 5 to 10 years, must be constantly de-orbited and replaced. This means that at least 10,000 satellites will have to be launched every year, forever into the future. If an average of 50 satellites can be launched on each rocket, that\u2019s 200 rocket launches per year, just to maintain the satellites used for cell phones and Internet. And it means the de-orbiting of 10,000 worn out satellites per year, burning them up in the atmosphere and turning them into toxic dust and smoke. And that\u2019s not counting the ever-increasing numbers of weather, research, tracking, monitoring, surveillance, military, and other kinds of satellites and missiles being launched in what will soon be a parade of rockets burning prodigious quantities of fossil fuels, punching holes in our atmosphere on a daily basis, and treating the source of all life as Earth\u2019s largest garbage pit.<br><br>More in next Message", "comment_date": "2020-08-23T06:58:42Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "WaschyNumber1", "comment_text": "And this days we have evil gates DNA manipulateing Vaccines forced on mankind with military force.<br>The new kind version of gates Vaccines is mankind doomsday no joke, a real Dr is speaking<br><a href=\"https://youtu.be/vdAYU9Xhx58\">https://youtu.be/vdAYU9Xhx58</a><br><br>The what a cashless society would be<br><a href=\"https://youtu.be/_bBK_wStu7c\">https://youtu.be/_bBK_wStu7c</a><br><br>Trumps military forced vaccinations<br><a href=\"https://youtu.be/M5O4bZ842qU\">https://youtu.be/M5O4bZ842qU</a><br><br>The storm is coming says trump with military force<br><a href=\"https://youtu.be/OKCbvlK3V9U\">https://youtu.be/OKCbvlK3V9U</a><br><br>It&#39;s all a money scam too, covid they make with this tests on one day in USA over 21000000$ payed with tax money.<br><a href=\"https://youtu.be/x3YOmKEhIsE\">https://youtu.be/x3YOmKEhIsE</a>", "comment_date": "2020-08-23T06:58:01Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Tyler Prendiz", "comment_text": "The Lord is amazing, he is the creator of all of this", "comment_date": "2020-08-22T07:27:39Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Josh Palmer", "comment_text": "It\u2019s all because of The Almighty God our bodies are so orderly and constant.

These amazing \u201cfunctional proteins\u201d, usually referred to as \u201cmachines\u201d, are extremely specific long chains of 20 amino acids, with typically over 150 amino acids per protein molecule. There are over 10^77th power non-functional combinations for every functional protein.<br>What makes it far more mind boggling is that every amino acid in the chain must have the same optical polarity (chirality). Every amino acid except glycine can have two polarities (like mirror images), and only one of the forms, the \u201cL-configuration\u201d, can be used in a functional protein. If a single amino acid has the wrong polarity, the protein does not function. We have no idea how protein molecules form with all the amino acids having only one polarity. It\u2019s one of the greatest mysteries of life. And it\u2019s true for every living cell on earth.<br> <br>In order for the simplest cell to exist, it  takes hundreds of different types of these extremely rare functional proteins (machines), each in large quantities, to come together at the exact same time and microscopic point in space, along with the functional cell membrane and many other components. The mathematical odds against the first living cells appearing by random chemical reactions in a pool of \u201cpre-biotic soup\u201d are overwhelming. <br>No chemist or biologist in the world has any idea how this could have happened by non-intelligent materialistic processes. It\u2019s so unlikely it would be virtually impossible, even in an eternal universe.<br><br>The more we know about life, the greater these mysteries become. This is only one of many examples. We now have far less scientific evidence than ever to support an atheistic world view of the origin of life.

With little difficulty you can see the seals of the Single, Eternally Besought One on the page of the earth, so raise your head, open your eyes, and look too at the great book of the universe. You will see that on it as a whole a stamp of unity is read out which is as clear as it is big. For like the components of a factory or members of a palace or town, these beings support one another, stretch out their hands to assist one another, and answer the needs and requests of one another, saying: &quot;Here I am, at your service!&quot; Assisting one another, they work together in order. Joining efforts, they serve animate beings. Co-operating and turned a single goal, they obey an All-Wise Disposer. They conform to a rule of mutual assistance which is in force from the sun and moon, night and day, and winter and summer, to plants coming to the assistance of hungry and needy animals, and animals hastening to the assistance of weak, noble men, and even nutritious substances flying to assist delicate, weak infants and fruits, and particles of food passing to the assistance of the cells of the body. They show to anyone who is not altogether blind that they are acting through the strength of a single, most generous Nurturer, and at the command of a single most wise Disposer.<br>   Thus, on the one hand this mutual support and assistance, this answering one another&#39;s needs, this mutual embracing, this subjugation, this order, testify decisively that beings are administered and organized by a single Disposer and are being impelled and directed by a single Nurturer. And on the other hand, this perfect grace within the universal wisdom to be seen plainly in the art of things; and the all-embracing mercy which shines within the providence; and the sustenance spread over that mercy and scattered so as to answer the needs of all living beings needy for sustenance; -these form a stamp of Divine unity so brilliant that anyone whose mind is not altogether extinguished will understand it and anyone who is not altogether blind will see it.<br>   Yes, a veil of wisdom demonstrating intention, consciousness, and will, has covered the whole universe, and upon that veil of wisdom has been spread a veil of grace and favour exhibiting beneficence, adornment, embellishment, and benevolence; and over that adorned veil of favour a garment of mercy displaying flashes of making known and loved, of bestowal and the granting of gifts has enveloped the universe; and spread over that illuminated veil of universal mercy is a table of general provisions showing kindness and bestowal and benevolence and perfect compassion and fine nurturing and dominical favour.<br>   Yes, all beings from particles to suns, whether individuals or species, or large or small, have been clothed in a magnificent shirt of wisdom embroidered with fruits and aims, benefits and purposes. And over the wisdom-displaying shirt, a garment of favour embroidered with flowers of grace and beneficence has been cut out in accordance with the stature of things; and over that ornamented garment of favour, a general table of sustenance has been set up, lit up with flashes of love, bestowal, affection, and the granting of gifts, to which the decorations of mercy have been attached, and which, together with bestowing those illuminated and jewel-encrusted decorations, is sufficient for all the groups of living beings on the face of the earth, and meets all their needs. Thus, this matter points to an All-Glorious Provider Who is All-Wise, All-Generous, and All-Compassionate, and shows Him as clearly as the sun.<br>   Is that so? Is everything in need of sustenance?<br>   Yes, like individual beings are in need of sustenance and all the necessities to continue their lives, we see that all the beings in the world, and especially living beings, whether universal or particular, wholes or parts, have many desires and needs, material and otherwise, for their existence, their lives, and the continuation of their lives. But their wants and needs are for such things that their hands cannot reach the least of them and their power is insufficient for the smallest of them. Yet, we see that all their wishes and material and immaterial sustenance is given to them From where he could not imagine, {[*]: Qur&#39;an, 65:3.} from unhoped for places, with perfect order, at the appropriate time, in a suitable fashion, with perfect wisdom. And so, does this want and need of creatures and this manner of unseen help and assistance not show an All-Wise and Glorious Nurturer, an All-Compassionate Beauteous Disposer?<br>Risale-i Nur Collection Words - 309 Bedi\u00fczzaman Said Nursi (R.

For as is proved briefly in the First Indication of the Tenth Word and in detail in the Twenty-Second Word, if every particle is not an official of God acting with His permission and under His authority, and if it is not undergoing change within His knowledge and power, then every particle must have infinite knowledge and limitless power; it must have eyes that see everything, a face that looks to all things, and authority over all things. For every particle of the elements acts, or can act, in an orderly fashion in all animate beings. But the order within things and laws according to which they are formed differ from one thing to the next. If their order was not known to the particles, the particles could not act, or even if they could act, they could not act without error. In which case, the particles which are performing their duties in beings are either acting with the permission and at the command, and within the knowledge and at the will, of the owner of an all-encompassing knowledge, or they themselves must have such an all-encompassing knowledge and power.<br>   Yes, all particles of air can enter the bodies of all animate beings, the fruits of all flowers, and the structures of all leaves. They can act within them, although the way the beings are formed is all different and their order and systems quite distinct. As though the factory of a fig was a loom for weaving cloth and the factory of a pomegranate, a machine for producing sugar, and so on; the programmes of their structures and bodies all differ from each other. A particle of air, then, enters or can enter all of them. It takes up its position and acts in a wise and masterly fashion without error. And on completion of its duty it departs. A mobile particle of mobile air, therefore, either must know the forms, shapes, measures, and formations with which plants and animals, and even fruits and flowers, are clothed, or else it must be an official acting under the command and will of one who does know.<br>   Similarly with a stationary particle of stationary earth: since it has the ability to be the means and place of cultivation for all the seeds of all flowering plants and fruit-bearing trees, either there must be in the particle itself or in the handful of soil that is its little house immaterial machinery and factories in good working order to the number of the varieties of the trees and plants, and flowers and fruits <del>in fact, it is in every single particle that there must be a factory peculiar to it and all the equipment and machinery necessary for the running of the factory</del> or else it must have a miraculous knowledge that knows all things about all things and a miracle-working power that creates everything from nothing; or, those duties are performed at the command and with the permission of One Who is Knowing of All Things, and through the power and might of One Who is Absolutely Powerful over All Things.<br>   If an untrained and inexperienced, common, ordinary, and blind man was to go to Europe and in all the factories there to work at all the trades and crafts in perfect and masterly fashion, and if he was to display a wise and artistic skill to such a degree that it left everyone speechless with amazement, anyone with a grain of consciousness would know that the man was not acting on his own initiative, but that a master of all trades was teaching him and causing him to work.<br>   And if there was a blind and impotent man who lived in a simple little house and was unable even to rise from his place, and if small fragments of stone, and bits and pieces of material like bone and cotton were to enter his little house and then sacks of sugar, bales of cloth, crates of jewelry, finely-made clothes encrusted with jewels, and delicious foods were to emerge, would anyone with a grain of intelligence not say: &quot;That man is a wretched doorkeeper or merely a latch on the door of the factory of a wondrous miracle-working being, which is the source of his miracles&quot;?<br>   In exactly the same way, the motion and duties of particles of air in plants and trees, and blossom and fruit, all of which are missives of the Eternally Besought One, antique dominical works of art, miracles of power, and wonders of wisdom, indicate that the particles are acting under the command and at the will of an All-Wise and Glorious Maker, an All-Generous and Beauteous Creator.<br>   Particles of earth, also, since they are the source and means for the shoots and plants produced by seeds, each of which is a different factory and workbench, a different printing-press, treasury, and antique, a different manifesto proclaiming the Glorious Maker&#39;s Names and ode hymning His perfections, it is as definite as two plus two equalling four that the particles of earth are acting at the command, with the permission, and through the will and power of an All-Glorious Maker Who is Lord of the command of &quot;Be!&quot; and it is, {[*]: Qur&#39;an, 36:82, etc.} and to Whose command everything is subjugated.

One need to have &quot;chlorofil&quot; to transform it. Evil did not have one, so created some machines, doing the job for him.<br>They broke down. He give them the capacity to repair themselves. He had to limit it, for after time the reparation does not pay. <br><br>So, he had to invent reproduction. Also, he had to go down with the size. It is better to have billions of little ones than one big one. These cells had to eat. They ate all they found and started dying from starvation.<br>So, he had to invent diversity. Different cells, feeding differently and eat each other&#39;s garbage or dead body.<br>*<br>Now, funny thing happened. The cells, receiving the conscious life energy, transform it (and loosing) to &quot;non Godly&quot; energy, started changing, tuning to consciousness. They started working together and creating mutual consciousness. Organism came to being. On the long way human is developed, who has a choice : turning to God consciousness or serving Evil.<br>*<br>Why to serve Evil? Evil is a bit yellow, for God stealing his show. Now, he still has the upper hands, for the organism are his domain, energy transformers. He has the POWER. Why?<br>For his system is created on cellular level and cells do work well (and feel &quot;happy&quot;) when the energy is drained from them by Evil. If he rejects it, the energy flow stops, and the cell suffers as a cow which is not milked. He probably invented the force system earlier, in order to better function. The cell forcing it, creates more useful energy, will have priority in &quot;milking&quot;. For he has a centre, where the energy collected and he need a steady flow. He gives priority for the better. It can explain, why evil people have so much energy and why is a fight for survival at all.<br>*<br>The beauty of this theory, that God doesn&#39;t know sh**it about you.

In other words, it\u2019s a sound vibration that is the essence of all of existence and non-existence, the ultimate creative force behind planets, stars, nebulae, people, animals, trees, fish, birds, and all phenomena, manifest or latent. All matter and intelligence are simply waves or ripples manifesting to and from this core source.  Consciousness (enlightenment) is itself the true creator of everything that is, ever was and ever will be, right down to the minutest particles of dust, each being an individual ripple or wave. The big difference between chanting Nam-myoho-renge-kyo and most other conventional prayers is that instead of depending on a \u2018middleman\u2019 to connect us to our state of enlightenment, we\u2019re able to do it ourselves by tapping directly into it by way of self-produced sound vibration.\r<br>\r<br>  On the subject of \u2018Who or What Is God?\u2019, when we compare the concept of \u2018God\u2019, as a separate entity that is forever watching down on us, to Nichiren\u2019s teachings, the true omnipotence, omniscience and omnipresence of what most people call \u2018God\u2019 is our enlightenment, which exists nowhere else but within us.\r<br>\r<br>   When the disciples asked Jesus where the Kingdom of God is, didn\u2019t he tell them that it was within them?\r<br>\r<br>   Some say that \u2018God\u2019 is an entity that can never be seen. I think that the vast amount of information that is constantly being conveyed via electromagnetic waves gives us proof of how an invisible state of \u2018God\u2019 could actually exist. It\u2019s widely known that certain data being relayed by way of electromagnetic waves has the potential to help bring about extraordinary and powerful effects, including instant global awareness of something or mass emotional reaction. As well as many other things, it\u2019s also common knowledge that these waves can easily be used to detonate a bomb or to even enable NASA to control the movements of a robot as far away as the Moon or Mars. However, none of this is possible without a receiver to decode the information that is being transmitted. Without the receiver, the information would remain impotent.\r<br>\r<br>   In a very similar way, it\u2019s important for us to have our \u2018receiver\u2019 switched on so that we can activate a clear and precise understanding of our life, all other life and what we and all else that exists truly is. Chanting Nam-myoho-renge-kyo helps us to achieve this because it allows us to reach into the core of our enlightenment and switch it on. That\u2019s because the sound vibration of myoho-renge-kyo represents the combination of the three major laws that underlie all existence.\r<br>\r<br>   Myoho represents the Law of latency and manifestation (Nature) and consists of two alternating states. One state of myo is where everything in life that\u2019s not obvious to us exists. This includes our stored memories when we\u2019re not thinking about them, our hidden potential and inner emotions whenever they\u2019re not being expressed, our desires, our fears, our wisdom, happiness, karma, and more importantly, our enlightenment. The other state, ho, is where everything in Life exists whenever it becomes obvious to us, such as when a thought pops up from within our memory, whenever we experience or express our emotions, or whenever a good or bad effect manifests from our karma. When anything becomes apparent, it simply means that it has come out of the state of \u2018myo\u2019 (dormancy/latency) and into a state of ho (manifestation). It\u2019s simply the difference between consciousness and unconsciousness, being awake or asleep, or knowing and not knowing something. \r<br>\r<br>  The second law, renge, governs and controls the functions of myoho, ren meaning cause and ge meaning effect. The two laws of myoho and renge, both functions together simultaneously, as well as underlies all spiritual and physical existence.\r<br>\r<br>   The final and third part of the tri-combination, kyo, is what allows the law myoho to be able to integrate with the law renge. It\u2019s the great, invisible thread of energy that fuses and connects together all Life and matter, as well as the past, present and future. It is often termed the Universal Law of Communication. Perhaps it could even be compared to the string theory that some scientists now suspect exists.\r<br>\r<br>   Just as our body cells, thoughts, feelings and all else are constantly fluctuating within us, everything in the world around us and beyond is also in a constant state of flux, in accordance with these three laws. In fact, more things are going back and forth between the two states of myo and ho in a single moment than it would ever be possible for us to calculate or describe. And it doesn&#39;t matter how big or small, important or trivial that anything may appear to be, everything that\u2019s ever existed in the past exists now or will exist in the future, exists only because of the workings of myoho-renge-kyo.\r<br>\r<br>  These three laws are also the basis of the four fundamental forces and if they didn&#39;t function, neither we nor anything else could go on existing. Simply put, all forms of existence, including the seasons, day and night, birth, death and so on, are all moving forward in an ongoing flow of continuation, rhythmically reverting back and forth between the two universal states of myo and ho in absolute accordance with renge and by way of kyo. Even stars are dying and being reborn in accordance with the workings of what the combination myoho-renge-kyo represents.\r<br>\r<br>   Nam, or Namu, on the other hand, is a password or a key; it allows us to reach deep into our life and fuse with or become one with myoho-renge-kyo. On a more personal basis, nothing ever happens by chance or coincidence, it\u2019s the causes that we\u2019ve made in our past, or are presently making, that determine how these laws function uniquely in each of our lives from moment to moment, as well in our environment. By facing east, in harmony with the direction that the Earth is turning, and rhythmically chanting Nam-myoho-renge-kyo for a minimum of ten minutes daily, anyone can experience actual proof of its positive effects in their life.\r<br>\r<br>  In so doing, we can pierce through even the thickest layers of our karma and activate our Buddha Nature (the enlightened state). We\u2019re then able to summon forth the wisdom needed to challenge, overcome and change our negative circumstances into positive ones. It brings forth the wisdom that can free us from the ignorance and stupidity that is preventing us from accepting and being proud of the person that we truly are, regardless of our race, colour, gender or sexual preference. We are also able to see and understand our circumstances and an environment more clearly, as well as attract and connect with any needed external beneficial forces and situations.\r<br>\r<br>  Actual proof soon becomes apparent to anyone who chants the words Nam-myoho-renge-kyo on a regular daily basis. Everything is subject to the law of Cause and Effect, so the strength of the result from chanting depends on dedication, sincerity and determination. To explain it more simply, the difference could be compared to making a sound on a piano, creating a melody, or producing a song and so on.\r<br>\r<br>NB: There are frightening, disturbing sounds and there are tranquil and relaxing sounds. It&#39;s the emotional result from any sound that can trigger off a mood or even instantly change one. When chanting Nam-Myoho-Renge-Kyo each day you are producing a sound vibration that is the password to your true inner-self - this soon becomes apparent when you start reassessing your views on various things, such as your fears and desires etc. The important way to get the best result when chanting is not to see things in a conventional way (difficult to achieve but can be done), rather than reaching out to an external source, you need to reach into your own life and bring your needs and desires to fruition from within, including any help that you may need. Think of it as a seed within you that you are bringing sunshine and water to in order for it to grow, blossom and bring forth fruit or flowers. It\u2019s important to understand that everything that we need in life, all the answers and potential to achieve our dreams, already exist within us.\r<br>\r<br><br><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6CZ0XJqWRr4\">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6CZ0XJqWRr4</a>         OLIVIA NEWTON-JOHN   sings about Nam-myoho-renge-kyo", "comment_date": "2019-06-29T03:31:55Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "A R", "comment_text": "Isn\u2019t it weird these molecular structures are doing this without knowing it while watching this video and learning about themselves?", "comment_date": "2019-06-29T02:39:15Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Pele shr", "comment_text": "so this is what everyone sees when on DMT", "comment_date": "2019-06-28T21:18:08Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Jonny Vincent", "comment_text": "How can you know this stuff and still not say there was a designer?

There will still be some element of BLIND FAITH involved but it is also based on the INCONTROVERTIBLE, UNDENIABLE and IRREFUTABLE FACTS that we do see;<br><br>Here is what I mean;<br><br>I examined the EVIDENCE of the complexity of our magnificent DESIGN OF LIFE, and I see a machine with unlimited capacity for self repair and maintenance and with numerous back-up and  FAIL SAFE systems. From there, and borrowing an expression from my thirty years as a trial lawyer, I came to the conclusion that;<br><br>Based on the PREPONDERANCE OF EVIDENCE  and on the BALANCE OF PROBABILITIES, it is much more LOGICAL to conclude that our DESIGN OF LIFE is the work of a CREATOR GOD or an INTELLIGENT DESIGNER rather then just the result of RANDOM chance and the mere passage of time.<br><br>For example, when you examine our INNATE IMMUNE SYSTEM, one of TWO such systems that we have, the other being the ADAPTIVE immune system,  you learn that it takes on average twenty (20 ) separate, distinct  chronological steps, executed in perfect SEQUENCE, to illicit even one immune response. If a major system, like the LYMPH system FOR EXAMPLE, fails to eliminate lymph fluid in its normal way, it is backed up by a hidden fail-safe system which we are not even aware of and which will kick in and allow LYMPH to excrete through the skin.<br><br>It makes no sense that such a complex  DESIGN OF LIFE is merely the result of  RANDOM CHANCE. <br><br>What do the \u2018evolutionist\u2019 theorists want us to believe ? That a bolt of lightening hit a pile of doo-doo four billion years ago\u2026and BINGO\u2026here we are ? This is patent NONSENSE and violates plain COMMON SENSE. The MAIN arguments in the theory of EVOLUTION are so fragile that they can be dismissed with this simple argument; <br><br>If EVOLUTION alone explains our existence then how come APES are still swinging in the trees ?Thee is no valid or convincing answer for this FLAGRANT CONTRADICTION within that \u2018 theory\u2019. President Johnson once said; \u2018 you cannot SUCK and BLOW at the same time\u2019 . Either we \u2018 evolved\u2019  from the more primitive APES or we did not. The fact that APES still exist or that they did not build skyscrapers before we did\u2026cannot be explained by this theory unless they come up with another tortured and convoluted \u00ab  exception \u00ab . There are MANY more examples of FLAWS in this theory or caveats but this is one alone is  enough to discredit it.<br><br>Another way to make this conclusion is to take a more enlightened view of the Universe as a whole and by saying;  We are no longer primitive camel drivers and sheep herders. We can accept the concept that the GOD who created us or the INTELLIGENT DESIGNER is a real and physical being, possibly the leader of a very advanced civilization who did genetically create us in his OWN IMAGE\u2026as it says. This means that our CREATOR GOD probably is a real, physical and tangible being and not some mystical, imaginary or intangible entity. <br><br>I hope that this line of reasoning helps some of you to resolve this issue and to accept the  idea that it is much more LOGICAL to conclude for the existence of a REAL and tangible  CREATOR GOD then to think we are just an \u00ab accident \u00bb of time.", "comment_date": "2019-03-09T00:20:21Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Jimmy Shrimbe", "comment_text": "This is horrifying!", "comment_date": "2019-03-08T18:53:46Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "The Wanderer", "comment_text": "I have a gift for you.

The biggest turn off to the Christian view point is that they always say - \u201cYOU WILL BE JUDGED!\u201d Why do they lead with that? It\u2019s so negative and off putting. <br><br>It\u2019s obvious and statistically true that we were probably designed by something, someone, or some group with much greater power, intelligence, and/or more knowledge than we currently have.<br><br>But to say with impunity that others are going to suffer through an eternal hell because they did not make the right choice while on earth...is ludicrous. If a designer created us and designed us to operate on free will, this designer would not judge a person by the limited amount of time they have on earth, while full well knowing that most are heavily influenced by the society and family they grow up in. So if you were raised by atheist parents and taught to respect reason your while life, you will probably surround yourself by like minded people, and thus go your whole life without really thinking or pondering if there is an after life or if we were created or designed. A designer would not put a non believer through the most horror ever felt by anyone for an eternity - to do so would be direct evidence that their intelligence is limited and not capable of creating or designing people to begin with.<br><br>Last point, some have suggested that we are simulations living out our perceived life in a computer and unaware of its substrate or operating program. That over time we ourselves might develop the computing power to create our own mini-universes with simulations in a computer and those simulated people will be unaware of us. There is no way to dispute this theory, the same as their is no way to dispute the Christian Narrative. The only theory that is actually disputable is that all intelligent life arose from random chance evolution. There is simply not enough time for this to happen. The knowledge and information that is built into our bodies is simply too complex to come about via random chance. Mathematics, information theory, probability theory bears this out.<br><br>So in the end, what you choose to believe will be in large part pre-programmed into your head, by your parents, your culture and government. But if you choose to free your mind from bias, look at everything rationally, you can discover many wonderful facts about life.<br><br>My personally discovery lead me to this worldview - I am a Voluntaryist (anarcho-capitalist, anarchist, free market believer, libertarian), intelligent design believer, and lastly a belief in Deism, where I favor the morality that Christ put forth in that you should \u201cLove your neighbor as you love yourself.\u201d That is so important to a life that makes you feel good on the inside (mentally) and in your gut. I do not believe everything in the canonized bible, I choose to follow the \u201cGolden Rule\u201d aka the non-aggression principle, and I do not believe in Hell. There is no way to prove there is an afterlife, that a God is overseeing this creation or that we are part of some Matrix. <br><br>  But...I do choose to believe in an afterlife, where you have a chance to learn more, be more, and live more. Anything else is dismal and depressing. And if I\u2019m wrong and there is nothing after death, I lived with more hope and excited expectation while on Earth. To the judgmental Christian, if I find myself in Hell, after having living a life in where I literally did all I could to better myself and others, and am in hell because I did not say or commit to the correct belief, I will be angry, and will look for a way to overthrow this tyranny I find myself in. I would choose to believe that this is not a being I would ever submit to. To the matrix believer, if there is an afterlife system in the matrix, I would seek to continue to better myself and others, while further trying discover the truth of my world and the world that houses the the program.<br><br>What do you believe? <br><br>Forgive me for any typos, as I did this quickly on my iPhone.", "comment_date": "2019-02-17T18:01:25Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Indic Imbecile", "comment_text": "Looks like a cyriak animation", "comment_date": "2019-02-17T06:44:34Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Angie Is the best of the best", "comment_text": "Once the heart and the brain stops it&#39;s game over for all those working  molecular mechanics.", "comment_date": "2019-02-17T03:38:03Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Lenin mcfarlane", "comment_text": "true intelligence humans dumb", "comment_date": "2019-02-16T21:09:02Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Sonia T", "comment_text": "You are peering into what we call the complex artwork of an intelligent designer....", "comment_date": "2019-02-16T17:18:06Z", "likes_count": 3}, {"comment_by": "king David", "comment_text": "This is Fake people are body don&#39;t have letters or numbers how funny he it created by man lol yup fake about are DNA the reason they know your blood type is could they got your blood in the government dated bass since you was born no man know what blood is made of but god does  poeple god hiden that from mankind becuz they evil", "comment_date": "2019-02-16T08:09:04Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Barny The Preacher", "comment_text": "and all of this is supposed to have happened by chance?

Phase transition transformed non-life matter into life and human consciousness, similarly the quantum field (Feynman) self-simulated intelligent conscious ;observer&#39; collapsing the field into fine tuned particles, implying the Anthropic Principle. And we discovered how how everything and every process in the universe is quantum mechanical and is governed by a SINGLE probability wave function.

Some physicists even claim that the whole universe is a quantum computer. The mathematics of QC enables us to understand superposition of the quantum states 0 and 1, called qubits, which gives us an insight into what multi-dimension means  and how they playout (very difficult to formulate and represent, making QC at room temperature a distant goal).

It&#39;s as if the commentor was already thinking about God as they watched the video. And who could blame them? The intricacies of life are so startlingly complex that only a fool would not recognize an intelligent design. I studied neuroscience in college and was profoundly impressed by the impossibly complex chemistry of life. You think vids like this are amazing? This vid does not even begin to scratch the surface of how much is going on inside even the simplest of cells. <br>I know that religion has a mixed history and that for that reason many people have chosen to eschew it entirely, but a true scientist does not discard any idea out-of-hand. Rather, they examine, study, and immerse themselves in every possible viewpoint until they discover the truth.<br> I also know that most people assume that such truth is subjective and therefore illogical, but I disagree; I believe that there is an objective truth beyond our feeble senses and that every religion is ultimately trying to uncover it through a mix of philosophy and revelation. If there is a God, it stands to reason that He would create some way for us to find Him, else why should we believe in him? We can witness his handiwork as we study His creations, but to reach out and contact Him directly transcends science, since a just God would not leave it to our differing scientific abilities to decide who can find Him and who cannot. No, a truly just God would make the path back to Him equally accessible to everyone, regardless of how much scientific training they have. Hence, science is not the answer to this question. It may serve as a confirmation to those who already believe, but it does not spark that belief by itself. <br>The answer lies in dedicating oneself to open-minded study and personal experimentation to see what merits or assistance religious faith may offer. Most people are too lazy to start that journey, but ultimately it is the only journey that matters since we are all just a few decades away from death anyways.

Why do you not ask yourself - for what reason would an inanimate object develop such a perfect system of encoding/decoding, and also a system to divide and pass this info on to another cell, so it also could build these machines?

I don&#39;t mind people disagreeing and presenting their point of view but please just don&#39;t troll or be hurtful. Feel free to correct me if I&#39;m wrong but natural selection is when the copying of DNA during reproduction randomly causes changes or mutations in the DNA. These mutations can lead to the organism to having unique features that could either give the organism an advantage, a disadvantage or simply have no effect at all. The organisms with the advantage are more likely to survive and reproduce than organisms without the advantage or a disadvantage. This means that more organisms are born with this advantage. Over millions of years, all these random changes can lead to a new species forming. It is well known in science that all living things started of as single celled organisms. Some of these molecular machines are vital for the division of microbes and therefore could not have been formed from natural selection. For example, without the machine that copies DNA and spins as fast as a jet engine natural selection and division would simply not exist. It is the machine itself that fuels natural selection because it copies the DNA. I believe that something of such complexity as the microbe could not have formed from a bunch of molecules that happened to just randomly bond together in a very specific and complex way. Surely there is something more.

When a population of life forms reproduces, a generation containing both imperfect (mutant) and perfect (non-mutant) life forms is produced.  These various mutant and non-mutant life forms are then exposed to the survival environment.  The heritable variations in these life forms affect the statistical likelihood of their success in creating their own mutant, further-mutant, and non-mutant offspring, which are, in turn, exposed to the survival environment where their heritable variations again may impact the likelihood that a third generation of mutant, further-mutant, and non-mutant offspring will happen, and so on.  The somewhat haphazard accumulation of traits in a population as a result of this process (&quot;evolution&quot;) is NOT &quot;random,&quot; though it involves a great deal of chance.<br><br>THE PROBLEM IS that all evolution requires the imperfect self-replication of life forms.  Thus, you need imperfectly self-replicating life forms to begin evolution.  Where do you get these from?  All such life forms known to us use DNA or RNA strands, ATP Synthase, little protonic batteries, and all the sophisticated panoply of micromachines to duplicate their defining molecules.  Even if you strip it down to a creature using ambient energy directly and the most primitive nucleic acids to record some set of traits, you still need micromachines to replicate and apply those acids.

Where did they acquire that knowledge? Did they go to the International School of Molecular Machines? Or did they make countless trial and error attempts until they got it right? And how did they know they got it right? Is there some sort of feedback mechanism from the top-level organism which lets them know they got it right? And if they don&#39;t get it right, the overall organism dies and they have to start the process all over again, countless times, until the whole process eventually works, in uniformity, among the hundreds of thousands of different types of tiny machines which could not survive independently, but requires all the other nano-machines to interface and communicate perfectly with each other in a complex network of precise operations. And then, the top-level organism would have to know what types of nutrients these tiny machines require and in what quantities and then make sure they receive what they need at the right time. How would it know that information? Do the nano-bots pass that information back up to the overall organism in some manner? So what we are left with is a top-level organism that could not survive unless all those nano-machine are doing exactly the right thing, exactly at the right time, without error, and do it over and over, relentlessly, with incredible precision, and then, pass that acquired information on to succeeding generations of nano-bots so they could continue the process for billions of years.

He has designed many different engines since, even including a molecular \u20184-wheel drive\u2019 car . By fixating the engine molecules to a surface, Feringa developed a nano \u2018mill park\u2019 in which the mills rotate when exposed to light. And last year he described the world\u2019s first symmetrical molecular engine .

What you are seeing are cyclic processors in operation at the cellular level. Life means cyclic processors exist in the system. This applies to all scales in an organism, not just the chemical nano-machines at the lowest levels. So, you don\u2019t need an alien ecosystem to compare biology to, because our technology already supplies just such a contrasting family of systems. Being alive in biology, being alive in technology, or being alive anywhere else, means exactly the same thing - cyclic processors in operation.<br><br>Conceptually, you can think of a cyclic processor as a loop or repeating process. Cyclic processors are machines that take lots of energy to keep the cycle going, so you need a sizable power supply (and be able to dissipate the generated heat). Processors have a lifespan, which is how long the processor is going. To be alive, any system must have at least one cyclic processor operating. Suspension means the processor has stopped its cycle. Death means the processor cycle can\u2019t be restarted. It doesn\u2019t matter what the processor is made of, what its contained function is, or whether it\u2019s replicating.<br><br>Let\u2019s use an air vortex example. Air can blow down the street as wind, from high to low potential \u2013 this is not life. If a dust devil forms and moves down the street you have a simple lifeform. The difference is that a processor has formed. It takes energy, it keeps on going, it has a lifespan, and it repeats the same basic process again and again. You can kill it by either removing its power supply, or interfering with its processor structure. Simple life forms of all types are always coming into and out of existence. Complex biological life has a cyclic processor based factory to allow them replicate, and evolve over time.<br><br>All factories (from ribosomes to universal assemblers) are alive because they contain (or are) cyclic processors, not because they can manufacture or replicate something. Viruses are not alive because they have no processors \u2013 they use a living factory in a cell to copy themselves. A lot of the active machinery in cells is alive (simple life). The same is true of the [cyclic] electronic information processors in computers, [cyclic] software processes, or [cyclic] electro-mechanical motors. Most of the activity in technological systems revolves around various flavors of processors, which serve to animate the system (frequently ill-defined, but much easier to understand than biology).<br><br>For humans, cyclic processors define life and death \u2013 things like lungs, circulatory systems, and brains, need to be \u201ckept going\u201d. In other words \u2013 air processors, fluid processors, and information processors need to be kept cycling. This is a large part of what physicians are measuring with their equipment, and how they determine life and death. Robots (artificial animals) have their own set of processors you can start and stop, so life and death apply to them as well.<br><br>Thanks for listening. ;)", "comment_date": "2017-11-21T11:46:08Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "vall 77", "comment_text": "maybe this race was engineered in the lab  eons ago", "comment_date": "2017-11-21T11:38:13Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "77SPAM", "comment_text": "And by the way ....

God needs not be extolled. God Himself would be trolling the unbeliever solely via the continuing (and never-ending) discoveries that have been provided in our universe (from the very big to the very small) --- if He didn&#39;t love him/her so much. No matter your intelligence (or your reliance on the intelligence of others), if you examine the universe and reach any conclusion that excludes a supreme being, you are a mooncalf by definition. Suggesting the universe itself spontaneously appeared without assistance from less than nothing is sufficient idiocy in and of itself. To further assert that this universe then slowly and faithfully &quot;evolved&quot; over time to a point in time where you miraculously arrived escaping from your mother&#39;s womb just in time to reject the very breath of God that gave you life is equally moronic. Finally, after being educated to a point where you can communicate with others, your sole purpose in life is to inform everyone that there is no God (ergo: no Creator, no Helper, no Sacrifice, no Salvation, no Hope) only solidifies your abject uselessness in the very universe you find so mundane.<br><br>For all of those finding so much fascination in the known - and even more unknown - of the universe while trumpeting the lack of an omnipotent ruler, it&#39;s time to repent. You&#39;re doing the work of satan exactly as he has hoped and making it easier for him. Why join the losing side when the battle is already over? And again, if you don&#39;t believe in God, satan, heaven, and the lake of fire, how can you marvel at the universe in the first place? The more remarkable the universe is, the easier it is to believe there is a purpose for our existence; and that purpose could only be to worship the very Creator of it all. Anythings else between birth and death is nothing more than a complete waste of time. What will you take with you to the grave? A suit? A money clip? A barbie doll? Your hat? Or hope, faith, and certainty of your soul&#39;s final destination? How easy it must have been for Jesus&#39; mother to know that He was the Son of God sent to save the world. Looking at the vast universe that was created solely for us, it only takes but a little more faith for us to believe as well.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br>Or...just keep fornicating and drinking yourself to oblivion, fools.

The RNA world hypothesis has major problems.<br><br>And finally, this video does not talk about the information contained within the molecule, and the specific sequence of the ATCG bases required for proteins, as opposed to just non-functional polypeptides, to be created. The information and sequence is an independent and abstract thing from the molecule itself, as its sequence is not determined by the backbone of the molecule. Think &quot;computer hard drive&quot; as the backbone, and an mp4 video file stored on the hard drive as the &quot;information&quot;. They are independent things, as the hard drive has no bearing on the order of the bits that make up the video file, because any type of information can be stored on the hard drive. DNA and its information is similar. Its bits are the ATCG bases, and its sequence plays an essential part in function. <br><br>Regarding origins, we have never found complex, sequence specific, functional information to have been created by chance. From our uniform and repeated experience, this type of information always originates from an intelligence. <br><br>Finally, claiming that things like mutations and cancer and errors imply there is no creator or the creator is bad/evil only shows one&#39;s preconceived notion of what he/she believes such a creator SHOULD be like. But said person is not in a position to know the mind or intentions of such a creator. What if this universe is not the only reality, and death is one of a planned part? If that is a possibility, then claiming there is no creator or the creator is bad/evil would be making a claim too soon. <br><br>I&#39;m glad Derek created a video like this.
