In a way, that just seems to make the probability belief subjective of the frame of reference as you introduce the probability of having the disease following a 2nd opinion.<br><br>With that said, Bay&#39;s theorem only applies in perceived probability, similar to someone who believes that following a series of coin tosses that have ended in tails, would incorrectly believe that the heads landing was due for a win simply because they&#39;re under the impression that with previous outcomes ending in tails winning, then considering that there&#39;s a 50% chance of the coin flip resulting in heads, the upcoming tosses should be more likely to land on heads, as if the preceding tail-landing wins somehow has an effect on the next coin toss which, probability-wise occurs independently of the previous coin toss, and wouldn&#39;t have any higher a chance of probability of landing on heads rather than tails. <br>By this logic, your realistic probability of having the disease is deterministic of which conditions you bring in as you&#39;re now factoring in the circumstances that came about to determine that probability: a pool of 1000 people, a pool of people who have been tested by the same machine that were reported as being positive for having the disease, or consideration of both pools in addition to the consideration of another opinion/test. So really the theorem just adds conditions for determining a perceived probability factor. At least by my guess, that seems like a valid/reasonable assumption or explanation as to why he didn&#39;t think or bother to publish it because it is purely subjective.

We internalize our beliefs to the point of certainty. In many societies we internalize not seeing certain groups (women, racial minorities, etc...) in certain positions or living in certain conditions to the point of certainty. Many unrepresented groups then think &quot;I can never do this or I can never live there&quot; until they see someone like them do it or live there. That is why it is important to provide the &quot;proofs of existence&quot; to those groups. If you have a minority faculty member in your department, make them visible, do not hide them, so that other minorities or under-represented groups can have that moment where their prior beliefs can be positively changed and have them realize that, they too, can achieve certain goals. So, that, they too, can feel that they can become a doctor, a Ph.D. or what have you. Why is it, for instance, that so many black boys here, in the US, believe that they can become a professional football player or basketball player? Because by constantly seeing black professional players, their belief system is updated to believe that they have a high probability (perhaps, even 100%) of becoming a  football player, when in fact, only 0.08% of high school football players will eventually hear their name called in the NFL Draft! <br>There is a need to show more unicorns (Women CEO&#39;s, Male nurses, women truck drivers, Black ballerinas,  women surgeon, Asian teachers, etc...). We can control what is shown and therefore what people learn. If you think about it and are old enough to remember, in the 70&#39;s only certain life experiences were shown on TV and this was, in a sense, a way to program the population to let them think (with certainty) that certain people lived in a certain way. Many people back then were &quot;certain&quot; that blacks only lived in ghettos, but the show &quot;The Jeffersons&quot; changed the views of many. &quot;The Jeffersons&quot; was also the first show to have an interracial couple, something many Americans frowned upon in those days. Nowadays (2021) you will notice that many commercials feature interracial or same-sex couples (or both) with their families.

You might say 90%\u2026 but not per Bayesian theory.  What\u2019s the ratio of P(A|E) to the much less preferred theory P(B|E)? <br>[P(E|A)x P(A)] over [P(E|A) x P(A)].  Or [0.1 x 0.98] divided by [0.9 x 0.02] = 5.44.  Meaning you would find Theory B to be 5 times more likely to be true than theory A, EVEN IF that piece of evidence is nine times less likely to be found if Theory A were true.  <br>Bayesian analysis, especially subjective Bayesianism, is actually likely what causes cognitive bias.

To make matters even worse, the subconscious is unable to tell if the pause in itself was due to you pausing or it pausing for an incongruency and by adding the pauses it has on the words you said, it becomes: the test correctly identifies 99% of people, who have the disease, and wrongly identifies 1% of the people, that don&#39;t have the disease.

It starts with the awkwardly worded input numbers: &quot;it correctly identifies 99% of the people who have the disease, and incorrectly identifies 1% of the people who do not&quot; (Slightly paraphrasing the syntax, but all of the important words are directly quoted). I guess the first thing to realize here is that &quot;identifies&quot; means that the test shows positive, which is weird, but that does seem to be what the hypothetical doctor means. The next confusing part is that since the numbers are 99% and 1%, which tidily add up to 100%, it&#39;s natural to assume, if you&#39;re only given a couple of seconds to think about it, that these numbers are for diametrically opposed situations, i.e in a given scenario one thing is true 99% of the time and is false the other 1% of the time. Combining this with the fact that the doctor was asked about what the chances were that the patient actually had the disease and then came back with these numbers, I think it&#39;s quite natural to assume that the numbers actually were &quot;99% of the time when you test positive you have it, and the other 1% of the time you don&#39;t&quot;, which is why 9% seems surprisingly. But actually, that&#39;s not what the numbers the doctor gave were. The doctor said that 99% of people that have the disease will test positive, and additionally 1% of the people that do not have it will test positive. Firstly, these numbers are not diametrically opposed, it could conceivably be the case that a test will test positive to 99% of people when they actually have it, and it could still be that 15% of the population without the disease also tests positive. There&#39;s no reason those need to add to 100%, but the fact that they do in the example leads you farther toward misunderstanding. The other thing is there&#39;s no reason these would be the numbers the doctor would give you, because there absolutely would be statistics available about the number of people who tested positive and then later either turned out to have it or not have it, and those are clearly the numbers you want when you ask that question. Those numbers definitely would add to 100% as the ones in the example do, so it&#39;s easy to assume those are the numbers you&#39;re given unless you&#39;re paying very close attention. If the numbers are given to you in a way that clearly explains which numbers you&#39;re getting, then 9% won&#39;t seem so surprising to you, because you&#39;d know that you weren&#39;t given any information that actually applies directly to your situation, only tangential stuff about the likelihood of getting certain test results when you already know whether or not you have the disease.

Just having symptoms should increase the probability. To find the actual probability, it should require the information regarding how many people are tested for it and have it come back negative, because you are taking a sample specifically of those tested for it, and a &#39;random sampling&#39; should be only among those who have been tested. If it&#39;s actually that rare, the number of negative tests should still be notable, but the probability of having it should be much higher than the odds of a random person from the general population having it. If even 1 out of 100 people tested had it, that&#39;s still a much higher chance. <br>Of course, a lot of this comes down to the concept of how probability can actually change. Like the odds of flipping a coin 10 times and getting heads every time is like 0.1%, so you could say that 10th flip, provided all previous 9 were heads, is 0.1%, but it&#39;s also 50%. (technically, it is 50%, but if it happened it would also fulfill a requirement to reach 0.1% at the same time).

The 9% chance is absolutely wrong because it\u2019s going off the wrong premises, is it not? The premise that 100% of people get tested, but only .001% of people have it. But 99% of people who test positive for it end up having it\u2026and you received a positive test, therefore IF they test everyone, and 1% of all tests produce the wrong result, which isn\u2019t even what the initial conditions are. The initial conditions say only out of those who test POSITIVE, 1% of only those positive results will be in fact not accurate. It doesn\u2019t have a 1% false positive rate over all tests, and all of those positives, at a 1% of all tested are wrong.

It\u2019s not counter intuitive at all, you just applied it incorrectly, it seems. Where am I wrong? Are the conditions that 1 out of every 100 tests performed provide and inaccurate result? Why are the tests being administered to people who likely do not have the disease, or are not suspected to have it? Why is only 1 out of every 1000 people TESTED getting a positive result, or why are 11 people getting a positive result if only 1% of all positive tests are a false positive, and only 1 out of every thousand gets a positive test result.

Our experience with COVID has actually brought the nuances of conditional probability to the manstream, which is an interesting observation given your concluding remarks.<br><br>Your hypothetical scenario states that the subject felt sick, and hence why they got tested in the first place. This piece of information is absoultely crucial and MUST be coupled to the Bayesian math. The 0.1% prior probability (that a randomly selected sample from the population has the disease) is only true as a random measurement, i.e., is only true if that sample is truly randomly selected. If the person feels sick (demonstrates symptoms) the chance the prior probability of having the disease increases dramatically. We&#39;ve learned this from COVID testing and positivity rates. Let&#39;s say that demonstrating any kind of sickly symptoms increases the prior from 0.1% to 1%, this changes the posterior probability of having the disease after having tested positive from 9% to 90%--a huge difference in probability (though not quite the 99% that people may intuitively think when first hearing the problem).<br><br>Now if the scenario you originally outlined were &quot;You participate in a random medical study aiming to validating the efficacy of a test for a disease that affects 0.1% of the population.

Essentially, Bayes is an average of an average. The thinking is that the average of the average will weed out all the outliers, but that doesn&#39;t work if the datasets that the original average were derived from were faulty. Bayes might work relatively well with diseases that have clear cut outcomes like terminal diseases, but the best example of Bayes NOT working is the 2016 Election. All of the polls that showed Hillary Clinton winning were wrong because their datasets were fundamentally flawed, thus taking an average of them yielded an incorrect result.  Want to know one of the major flaws of COVID policy? Double counting. We were told that we were short tens of thousands of hospital beds and ventilators because we were going to have the regular flu season patients PLUS COVID patients. Do you see the double counting error? COVID patients are often the old frail patients who would have needed that bed or ventilator anyway because they are the ones more likely to get the flu. We were never short ventilators or hospital beds. COVID and flu patients, which are often one and the same, were double counted. Using Bayes for COVID potential morbidity is actually ridiculous because there is no clear cut outcome. Asymptomatic people never get tested because they don&#39;t even know they have a disease. People who die WITH COVID are often tabulated as dying FROM COVID. (millions of people die WITH  warts every year, but they don&#39;t die FROM the warts). Again,  averaging averages with Bayes is useless if the datasets are faulty to begin with.

Bayes&#39; theorem still applies, but as noted, that probability in the numerator is a bit tricky. I also wonder if the way the results are read isn&#39;t different between a wide-spread test where the technician isn&#39;t expecting positive results often (because most people won&#39;t have it) and when they&#39;re testing people who they assume are getting tested for a reason.

People who give one false positive are likely to do it again because there&#39;s often something in their blood that causes it.

Bayesian formalism of probability is almost certainly the best we have in practical cases. However, people tend to not be able to objectively evaluate and/or accept the results. Since you quoted Nate Silver, I will mention that Silver&#39;s last update (November 8, 2016) on 538 gave Hillary Clinton a 71.4% chance of winning the election. Although this gave Trump a better chance than most models, it was still drastically influenced by something other than reality. Most likely, this was some combination of poor polling practices and incorporation of personal wishes into the prior probabilities used by Silver&#39;s model. More recently, 538&#39;s predictions of the California and Wisconsin special elections were off by a decent amount. Yet, he still seems to maintain his prior belief that there will be a blue wave in the Fall; we&#39;ll have to wait and see if he&#39;s correct on this one. This does not take away from Bayesian analysis in any way. It does, however, highlight a fallacy in how the formalism is used, especially in contentious fields where people have strong opinions.

And because of that we resort to simpler ideals and simpler methods of calculating what&#39;s acceptable and what&#39;s normal what&#39;s going on in the world around us we feel like we have so little impact as individuals and as towns etc that we forget that it&#39;s the sum of quite a few parts not all not a lot sometimes a very very vocal minority gets their ideas in front of everyone because they put in lots of hard work and effort so we kind of failed to see that most things are marginal and that you have to not take giant leaps or big strides but you have to take noticeable steps as communities as organizations as developers of anything that it&#39;s step by step and we can calculate those steps nowadays so we could be better faster and teaching how we get success and how we make things successful in general. We could be significantly improving each other&#39;s time by simply helping each other more but we don&#39;t see the effects of us helping so we don&#39;t feel like we&#39;re helping anyone at all ever. Because those are feel like baby steps unless we get some sort of feedback saying look what you did did make a difference you went from 12% to 20% and it&#39;s something that we can tangibly see or feel otherwise we will ignore it. I think the core the problem is that we don&#39;t have any kind of reward system or incentive to be what we consider altruistic but by the numbers. If everyone did everything they could without sacrificing their own you know wants and needs free time they still relax as the evening and whatever time is comfortable for them and their brain etc. if we spent more time just looking around going oh that person needs help and I go help them The probability of me being helped when I need help with something skyrockets we&#39;re talking right now the likelihood of somebody stopping and helping you is probably less than 50%, probably like 407% depending on where you live a whole bunch of factors about what you look like there&#39;s always your biases behind whether or not somebody would help you if your car broke down for instance. but if you just literally walk out the front door see somebody needs help with whatever and just immediately don&#39;t think about it and help them The likelihood of that happening again in the area that you live in literally goes up by like 50%. So now every person you meet has a 50/50 chance of helping you out. Because half the people that were walking by saw that and saw that good act and then most people see that stuff like the reciprocated and be good people too so then they pay for the coffee for the guy in the car behind it then somebody sees them doing that but the probability of everything again regressed to the mean. about 50/50 but if everybody does that and you start noticing it and doing it yourself right you if you do it a lot and you know somebody next you does a lot well now the chances are 75% and the whole community just by two people walking around always helping other people. and you can very quickly see how a lot of diminishing returns you keep any more people then it&#39;s like 82%, so on and so forth until everybody&#39;s just always helping each other buy the numbers the reason people help each other is because it&#39;s the best and most effective way to get help whenever you need it yourself. This is why we live in a society because it&#39;s faster smarter and ultimately it accelerates our growth. But there&#39;s always the law of diminishing returns.

The first reasoning is very very dangerous for the following reason: it encourages patients to believe that if a doctor prescribes them to make a test which fails with 1% probability and if the disease that it tests is rare, then even if the test returns a positive result, you still have low chance to have the disease. This is PLAIN WRONG !! The reasoning is correct if you were chosing somebody at random in the population and subject that person to the test. But if you went and saw a doctor and if the doctor prescribed you the test it actually means that you are not a random person in the population, and that the doctor has some concern that you could actually have that rare disease. In Bayesian terms this means that the posterior probability that the doctor would assign to the possibility that you would have the disease is much higher than in the general population, even though the doctor is not able to give you a number, and that unknown posterior should be the prior that you should use to do the proposed calculation. So you don&#39;t have a good measure of your prior and you can&#39;t compute a posterior... bad luck !! This means that you should certainly not use the overall probability of that disease in the population and apply the calculation proposed here ! The only thing that you should consider is that if this test is done on 100 people it fails only 1 percent of the time... This video is dangerous because it can lead somebody who goes and get tested for HIV in the US to think that since there is only 0.3% of Americans that have HIV, even if they take a test that has an error chance of 1% there is only 0.99*0.003/(0.99*0.003+0.01*0.997)=0.25 so 25% chance that they have HIV,<br>but this 25% is wrong, because if you got tested it is probably because you thought you could have been at risk, which already increases a lot the prior probability from 0.3%. Second incorrect point is that Spam filters use what is called the Naive Bayes classifier which is actually not a Bayesian algorithm: like many people who only understand statistics superficially the presenter is confusing &quot;applying Bayes rule&quot; which is an elementary rule from the calculus of probability (no point in calling this a theorem), with being a Bayesian statistician and using Bayesian statistics... Finally, the discussion at the end about the posterior becoming more and more of a certainty as life goes by, this make no sense because this is ignoring that the world is changing, and statisticians are not stupid enough to ignore that. Statisticians actually call this non-stationarity and in that case the statistical procedure are different and &quot;forget some of the past certainties&quot;.", "comment_date": "2019-11-01T19:14:35Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Hosein Ghanbari", "comment_text": "I somehow get excited listening to statistical inferences and this was one of the best examples that how we can implement statistical theories in real life...

They find &#39;ST depression&#39; during exercise if you have coronary artery disease.&quot;  Bayesian theorem applies to this problem.  If the man is a 58 year old hard driving executive, who smokes like a chimney, has a cholesterol of 250, never exercises, has hypertension and father who died of a heart attack at age 45, the EKG is probably not necessary.  (He should go directly to a coronary angiogram).  In this setting, he is so likely to have coronary artery narrowing that even a negative treadmill exercise test is probably a false negative.  On the other hand, if the man is a 26 year old athlete, who never smoked, has stayed trim, has a cholesterol of 135, and a blood pressure of 110/65 and has a no family history of heart attacks, even a &quot;positive&quot; treadmill is likely a false positive. (an angiogram is not necessary).   It is the 48 year old man who is a little out of shape, doesn&#39;t smoke but has mildly elevated blood pressure, a cholesterol of 180 and a weak family history (or a similar combination) where a treadmill can help decide if an angiogram is necessary.  This all pertains to people with &quot;atypical&quot; chest pain.  For a convincing history of pressure-like chest pain radiating down the left arm upon strenuous exertion would favor to a greater degree getting an angiogram.    I believe that it is this setting (does this individual with atypical chest pain deserve an exercise stress test or not) is the first recognized setting where Bayesian theorem was applied.

So one will become even less willing to try hard or try a different way.

The problem is &quot;we&quot;. If &quot;we&quot; - &quot;I&quot; from yesterday is really independent from today&#39;s &quot;I&quot; then after 1000 rejections we can really conclude that &quot;I&quot; am always rejected. We falsely assume that yesterday&#39;s result is independent of today&#39;s result. But why would that be? If we are still the same? If we change and we we still get rejected, then that might be the law of universe. That we really cannot get a date. That conclusion is only valid if we changed from yesterday&#39;s we and we still cannot get a date then there are two possibilities : 1) we think we changed but we did not, 2) we cannot get a date. So do we change? If we don&#39;t then no wonder we get the same result. This is the trap. But this is no trap. This is just a trip, the guy is tripping us out with this obvious fact combined with some twisted phylosophy to get some money. Now this is the most clever part in this video. He is doing the 1000 year old trick: here is nothing grab onto it really tight. Confusing us with some crap and making us believe that now our life will change and suddenly we will get a date tomorrow. No. The problem won&#39;t go away. He won&#39;t change us. We will. No, to be honest we won&#39;t. That was a lie. I admit it to you. He does not. You will not change. You better get used to this.  Change is expensive, it&#39;s cheaper to eat sweets, use facebook, watch xxx, get drunk/high than to change. For change you need to pay. He makes it look cheap. That&#39;s a lie. It&#39;s not cheap. Do not blame yourself. If you do not want to pay for change then don&#39;t but you need to be conscious of the fact that it&#39;s not your fault that you don&#39;t progresss, it is the fault of high price and cheaper solutions. Nowadays the weak survive easily. 10000 years ago they died. Staying alive was expensive. Getting a women was expensive. Today we have a choice. We use facebook and stay alive or we learn to fight and stay alive. What is fight nowadays? How do ppl fight? Business. Money. Persuasion. Social skills. Job. Staying alive nowadays is cheap. Satisfying needs is cheap. No wonder we do not chose the hard way. We don&#39;t have to. But we still can. It&#39;s a choice. Not such a difficult choice: watching videos like this and making him rich or starting our startup and making ourselves rich. That&#39;s the real Bayesian trap.

In actuality, he didn&#39;t error. We can construct a 2x2 probability  matrix with actual diagnosis (Y/N) for the rows and predicted diagnosis (Y/N) for the columns. If the test correctly ID&#39;s those who have the disease 99% of the time, the top row would be 0.99 (actual = Y, predicted = Y) and then 0.01 (actual = Y, predicted = N). Then he says the test will only incorrectly ID those who don&#39;t have the disease 1% of the time. This means the bottom row would be 0.01 (actual = N, predicted = Y) and 0.99 (actual = N, predicted = N). Then we multiply the proportions of the population that actually have the disease through the rows. So, since 0.1% of the population has the disease, the (actual = Y) row,  which is the top row, is multiplied by .001. The bottom row is then multiplied by .999 because the sum of the proportions of the rows needs to sum to 1. The result is a 2x2 matrix with a top row of (.00099, .0001) and a bottom row of (.00999, .99001). To find the probability of having the disease (Actual = Y) GIVEN we tested positive (Predicted = Y), we take the value in the (actual = Y, predicted = Y) cell, which is the top-left, and divide it by the sum of the values in the first column where both cases are (predicted = Y).

So, the point I want to bring is, even though this sickness may appear in 0.1% of the population, the P(H) is not 0.1%, since there is a greater chance that the person has it.

I do, however, feel like it&#39;s vitally important to point out what I see as a huge flaw in what you presented re: what the second result tells us. It&#39;s with respect to the posterior probability if you just went to a different doctor and had them run the same test, and sent it to a different lab (as you mentioned around <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R13BD8qKeTg&amp;t=5m18s\">5:18</a>).<br><br>I only bring this up because this example can create a dangerous false impression that could make people believe they&#39;re very, very likely to have the disease just by doing this, when in fact they might instead have very nearly the same 9% chance after doing things like this. People might internalize that idea, and later think they&#39;re almost certainly doomed when they&#39;re almost certainly NOT.  That would be, in my opinion, a very bad misinterpretation to provide, and I&#39;d hope you agree. Less unnecessary panic is better than more. =)<br><br>The way the probability updates on later runs would depend to a very great deal on WHY it is that a given test might show a false positive when it is run on someone who comes in and gets a battery of tests run on them, including this one.  (Others have pointed out that these are not people selected at random, so that has an effect as well, but I&#39;ll ignore that and focus on what I see as the bigger problem.)<br><br>For any given test that can produce a false positive, there are usually multiple reasons why that can happen. A common problem is that the test is triggering &quot;positive&quot; on something that is present, but which is NOT the disease being tested for.  That sometimes (rarely) happens because of things like cross-contamination or lab execution errors and the like, which is part of with why you&#39;d like to get a second test done. But it can also be that some small fraction of the human population has some other benign marker, often genetic, which just so happens to mimic what was being tested for.<br><br>If the person going in initially has one of those markers, they could go to a dozen different doctors using a dozen different labs, and those same tests would likely all come back positive, but using the idea you&#39;ve presented here, repeated application of that same test would make those updated probabilities converge towards your original P(H), while in reality they never had the disease to begin with. Repeated application of a flawed testing methodology doesn&#39;t change the probabilities at all in this case!<br><br>Since tests like this can fail in this way, what is much important to do is to apply a DIFFERENT (and often much more expensive) test which can also detect the disease, but doesn&#39;t suffer from that same genetic-marker-false-positive flaw as the first one.  That makes this sort of test almost fully independent from the first kind of test, and that&#39;s when you can update the probabilities in the way you showed.<br><br>We see something like this in HIV and AIDS testing. There are a variety of relatively cheap, reliable and fast ELISA tests that are use as initial screening tests. Coming back as positive on the first run of one of those is the sort of thing that people shouldn&#39;t misinterpret, which is why they are always run a second time for initial re-checking, and if that repeats, a more expensive and very different sort of test (Western Blot) is run for confirmation.<br><br>The important misconception (in my opinion) is treating the test as something that gives a false positive only due to random chance, and therefore just running it again gives you a independent trial from the first one. That&#39;s the only situation where it&#39;s ever appropriate to re-use the same probability in updates due to repeated trials: when there is no relationship at all between one trial outcome and a second trial outcome. Hopefully I&#39;ve outlined here just one reason (of several) why that may not be the case in something as vital and stressful as test results where &quot;your life is on the line&quot;.", "comment_date": "2018-03-01T19:02:49Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Hard Ware", "comment_text": "I was working on machine learning, then I saw a section of the code is related to Gibbs sampling.

In this case, the prior probability is the same as the prevalence of the disease in the population, simply because we&#39;re treating the test as a screening one, not diagnostic. If you were to do the test on someone who instead has, for example, symptoms of the disease, then the prior probability of them having the disease is higher, and so you&#39;ll come out with a higher post-test probability after performing the test. In this case, the test has been performed for diagnosis, not screening. <br><br>This is exactly what the process of clinical diagnosis involves - a doctor first has a suspicion of the person having the disease (symptoms, signs, and risk factors all play a role in this), i.e. their pretest probability of having the disease is now higher than that of the average random person in the population, and so a diagnostic test is ordered to confirm their suspicions. If that comes back positive, then you can be pretty sure they actually have the disease. It&#39;s really important that in this kind of scenario doctors don&#39;t just order a whole lot of tests in everyone , i.e. those with low pre-test probabilities of many diseases, and hope that something comes back positive, because even if something does come back positive, the chance of that being a false positive is quite high, simply because their pretest probability for that disease was low. Diagnostic tests should be used merely to confirm what the doctor already has a suspicion of - of either someone having a disease (in which case they&#39;d order a SPECIFIC test), or of someone NOT having a disease (in which case they&#39;d order a SENSITIVE test).<br><br>On the other hand, the very definition of screening is to identify a disease in people who otherwise would have no indication that they may have the disease, and so their pretest probability is the same as the prevalence of the disease in the population. That&#39;s why screening tests are more sensitive than specific - which means that if the result comes back as negative, their pretest probability was low as well and so you can be pretty darn sure they don&#39;t have the disease. However, as you can see, if the test comes back positive, the chance that they have the disease is still being quite low (because of the low prevalence in the population), and so that&#39;s why screening tests have to be followed up with more specific (but not as sensitive) tests, such as biopsies.", "comment_date": "2018-01-19T01:47:48Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Paul M", "comment_text": "Very nice!", "comment_date": "2018-01-17T01:08:40Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Sanshray's Music", "comment_text": "Great job!

But then eventually, the man will learn one way or another that the sun isn&#39;t rising at all, but that he simply is rotating towards it each morning. And just like that, this world that he was only starting to become familiar with and sure of, is something completely different than he first thought. No amount of &#39;experimentation&#39; (watching the sun rise) could have led him to find this truth without pushing the extent to which he exerimented. And now he&#39;s left with a choice: become even more curious about this world as a result of what he&#39;s found, or be discouraged by the fact that everything he thought he knew was wrong.

He mentions that people have a sort of Bayesian way of thinking without even realizing it whether it be expecting rejection after many times being rejected, or expecting a low wage at work because that&#39;s just how it&#39;s always been. And when you think about it, the main thing that separates the pioneers in life from the mediocre is what they choose when their world is turned upside down. Do they choose to accept that they were wrong about the sun rising and start to just dejectedly expect to be wrong, and eventually lose motivation to even try to discover things in the world around them? Or are they motivated by the fact that there&#39;s more to learn?

I would bet that most discoveries in science in the past had a pretty abysmal chance of discovering something new until somebody realized that the application space just wasn&#39;t specified wide enough. A good example is Newton&#39;s gravity. Applied to big stuff it all was fine, and Bayesian would basically have told a 1900 researcher that there&#39;s absolutely nothing wrong with it, based on all the applications until then. But applying it to small stuff created the problems, and the motivation to expand gravity. So, in summary, I&#39;d say Bayesian theorem is pretty useful, but possibly not useful for arguing if there&#39;s something to discover, because the definition space or application space will control how certain the outcomes are.

People are not very good at telling when they feel sick and in what way. In addition, the presumption here is that the person &quot;doesn&#39;t feel 100%,&quot; which is a very vague symptom that could easily be contributed to your own mental state. Put simply, people can cause a reverse placebo effect, or that people make mistakes. Felt Symptom =/= Actual Symptom.<br>b.) Even if this person didn&#39;t make a mistake, the other big thing is that almost every symptom can be caused by multiple actual physical problems with your body. This is why, when you try to diagnose your own problems online, you often find yourself self-diagnosing yourself multiple high-risk diseases and problems. Doctors have to sift through all these symptoms to find the most likely one based on current activities, past health issues, and most common health problems.<br>c.) Finally, if you understand how science works, you might recognize that the &quot;rare disease&quot; they speak of might not even be a real thing. The problem is that, in the community of science, people will label a series of similar occurrences as something, and might even learn enough to put it into a box of a disease. However, later research might reveal the &quot;rare disease&quot; to actually be a facet of a common one, or a combination of a genetic predisposition and another health problem, etc... The idea of multiple personality disorder was once thought to be it&#39;s own separate phenomena, but these days it&#39;s a form of schizophrenia.<br><br>These problems, plus the existence of probably other problems, mean that you can&#39;t easily just say that &quot;I felt I had symptoms, therefore it helps confirm the disease&quot;.

Its not even inside the def. of a rare disease (1/1500). <br><br>secondly and more importantly, if a doc tested for a disease that has a 0.1% prevalence, he already had a clinical suspicion because of symptoms and/or other tests, meaning that the starting probability is much higher than 0.1%. An exact number is almost impossible to get to in real life, however the theoretical possibility will be the number of patients that have the disease when that doctor gets suspicious enough to test for it, thus the end probability after one and two tests will be much higher than the disease prevalence which is the number you used,<br><br>thirdly the way you present inverse specificity is wrong. You define it as identifying a certain amount of the population who do not have a disease. If this was true then specificity would be dependant on the number of people that dont have the disease. A silly idea. No. Specificity is the chance that those who do not have the disease but are tested for it are correctly identified as not having it (and the inverse sensitivity will be the chance that a person who is tested and does not have the disease gets a false positive).<br><br>:D", "comment_date": "2017-04-22T19:13:32Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "wirechair", "comment_text": "Bayesian probability is amazing.

A couple of days ago I learned about an optical phenomena I had never seen before. The person talking about the phenomena described it as &quot;light from your eyes in foggy mirrors&quot;. There are a lot of references to this on the net but mostly on non scientific forums where explanations include things such as &quot;this is proof of the soul&quot; or &quot;inner energy&quot;. Apparently the phenomena is more common in hotel mirrors than at home. So this Friday when I stayed in a Hotel  and came out of the shower and saw that the mirror had steamed up I decided to look for the phenomena. At first I noticed next to nothing, but after staring into the mirror for a while, whilst shifting my position in the bathroom I noticed that the higher in the room and the further away from the mirror I got my head the more clearly there was light shining from my eyes. I performed a simple experiment and switched off the light in the bathroom and the light in my eyes disappeared ( as expected). I turned the light on again and took note that there was a single down light above the mirror, very close to the mirror.  The &quot;light from my eyes&quot; only occurred when my reflection was in the light cone from the down light. Do you have any idea what causes this Derek? My hypothesis is that the steam droplets on the mirror combined with the mirror acts in a similar way as a retro-reflector or something like that.", "comment_date": "2017-04-09T12:29:35Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Nox", "comment_text": "wow cool.

So why not doubt &#39;Logic&#39; itself? Say we doubt it, the moment we apply the methodic doubt, we cannot make any deduction whatsoever.

I come out of the rabbit hole after in free fall for about two years and drag in you with me:<br><br>1. non-informative priors are a thing, but one still must choose it. This introduces an element of subjectivity into the methodology. Any and all science based on Bayesian methodology is inherently subjective. That doesn&#39;t mean it&#39;s useless; it&#39;s clearly useful. I&#39;m just pointing out a scientist&#39;s worst nightmare: your work is subjective.<br><br>2. Assuming you know the correlations between all probabilities, one of three things will occur by adding in new information: the probability will instantly become 0 (contradiction), not change (irrelevant information), or increase. However, in the absence of knowledge (i.e. in reality), you don&#39;t know the correlations. Hence, it is completely logical and consistent to say that the probability of a given person dying in a car crash is 10^-4 while maintaining that the probability that <i>you</i> die in a car crash as being 10^-18. This is because you don&#39;t know anything about a given person but you know a lot about you.<br><br>3. Conditional probabilities are based on perspective and knowledge. The more you know, the more you account for. We all know something. There is no such thing as a true marginal probability.<br><br>4. You are in fact wrong in your assertion about the dogmatic person&#39;s argument. If the probability of A given I is 1 but Ac is true, then the probability of A given I and Ac is 0. Thus, one must either conclude that the initial condition was incorrect or that Ac is in fact false. But this is irrelevant because debates are adversarial systems of arguments. If you&#39;re trying to convince your opponent, you&#39;re doing it wrong or you&#39;re not debating. The whole point of a debate is to convince the third party who is watching that you are right. With this information, the third party can then look at the information to determine the correct course of action.<br><br>5. There is a murder. Three suspects are apprehended at the scene but only one set of prints is on the murder weapon. The prosecution shows that the probability that the suspect on trial&#39;s prints are on the weapon given that the prints match is statistically significant (i.e. he is the murderer). The defense shows that because there were three individuals, the probability of a match for at least one of the suspects given that three were present is not statistically significant (i.e. reasonable doubt is present). This example illustrates the importance of prior distributions.<br><br>6. The test itself is a conditional probability; an expanded form would be &quot;what is the probability I have the disease given that I have a positive test result and the test result was done with such and such methodology and the initial framework study was based on so-and-so methodology?&quot; From your perspective in life, you can come to a vastly different estimate that is in fact logically consistent simply because of your subjective reality.<br><br>7.

For example, if estimating a population mean from data, you might specify a t-distribution (because you are not sure if the population is really normal, or perhaps you have outliers in your data set) with a mean, std dev, and normality parameter. For each of those, a distribution is specified for how you think the parameter could distributed.

For instance, Derek&#39;s prior of just taking the incidence in the general population is probably already invalid. Why? Well, you show the symptoms of the disease, that means you are already far more likely to have the disease than joe everyman next to you.<br>Why is this an issue? Well, Bayes&#39; theorem is really good at showing you the highly counterintuitive odds of something being true, you just need to know the priors. And that is a huge wild card, everything stands and falls with the prior. You can use highly biased priors to &quot;prove&quot; your point, you just need to convince your audience that these priors are valid (and to some extent, Derek already did this by convincingly endorsing a likely inaccurate prior).<br><br>You could argue, for instance, that human made climate change is a myth even though we have strong evidence to suggest so. You could just say, well what are the odds that us tiny puny humans can have an impact on the global scale evironment? It&#39;s infinitesimal! Just look at the size of our planet! It&#39;s HUGE! So let&#39;s just input prior p=10^-13 or something (weight of all humans / weight of the earth).
