I run an open source electronics company and I have been trying to tell people of all the great stuff we can do with 3D printers and open source hardware. I like the humanist/noncapitalist vibe they have of providing free arms. This tech is so positive it is a great example of something we can decouple from the capitalist system using a donation-funded model. If they register as a nonprofit, wealthy people looking to do good can also benefit from a tax break on the money they contribute to the cause. Plus it&#39;s just an amazing thing to do for young children who can&#39;t necessarily afford custom engineered robot arms. We have the tech to make people whole again and providing it for free is really the best way, so everyone who needs one can get their life back. So yeah... these people are great. What&#39;s really disappointing, however, is how microsoft seems to have completely co-opted these people&#39;s message to sell some lame software. As an engineer I wanted to get in touch with these people and help contribute to their efforts, but I seem to have encountered a wall of microsoft advertisements that completely obsure any links to these people&#39;s good work. Neither the end of the video nor the links in the description include any direct link to these great people&#39;s work, seemingly because microsoft has bought their name for a handful of cash. It&#39;s great for a wealthy organization to connect with people who can benefit from the cash, but they&#39;re actually interfering with this group&#39;s main goal by obscuring their contact info for people like myself who want to help. I don&#39;t use microsoft products, and I&#39;m not interested in their ads. I just want to help. Can you please include a link to these amazing people&#39;s work directly in this video? Even a quick google search is leading me back to articles that only applaud Microsoft&#39;s involvement, but do not focus on these engineers. Please link to their work in this video&#39;s description, they deserve it. I will keep looking, but people shouldn&#39;t need to.
