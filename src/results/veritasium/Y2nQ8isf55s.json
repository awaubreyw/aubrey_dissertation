My background is metallurgy, I\u2019ve worked in steel and aluminum sheet rolling mills.  Some examples:<br>- When we roll a metal coil from ingot, new surface is created as it is elongated.  In manufacture of clad products, two slabs are rolled together in a hot mill.  As the oxide in between is broken during hot rolling, the two metal alloys adhere to one another due to the vacuum between the pieces.  This same process has been shown to work with cold rolling as well.  The University of Michigan has a lab scale unit for demonstration.<br>- During stamping of sheet metal, galling may occur when the oxide of the softer metal splits and comes into contact with the metal of the die in the absence of air.  Air/oxygen is absent because of high pressure and the presence of lube. Metal sticking may be called adhesion, and small amounts of metal on the die increase the local pressure there during stamping of the next part, leading to more galling and buildup on the die.<br><br>In summary, metals bond to one another in a vacuum and you don\u2019t need to go to space to observe it.  This phenomenon is used intentionally in manufacturing, and using dissimilar metals does not necessarily decrease the likelihood of bonding.  Metal-to-metal bonding can also be unwelcome, and requires die maintenance and intentional planning to control, such as the use of dry film lubes versus wet lubes.<br><br>Keep up the great videos!", "comment_date": "2021-09-16T06:11:55Z", "likes_count": 45}, {"comment_by": "I LIKE BEANS!!", "comment_text": "Jesus loves u all so much", "comment_date": "2021-09-16T06:02:39Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "It's Henry", "comment_text": "That&#39;s really interesting.

Although the metal being oxide free is a requirement of cold welding the real reasons that we don&#39;t see metals on Earth cold welding is that only soft metals are capable of cold welding and (outside a vacuum) you need to press very hard on metals to get them to cold weld (to the point that you are going to be generating quite a lot of heat and probably deforming the metal) in order to drive the atmosphere gasses out of the joint. There are a few exceptions like indium that will cold weld outside a vacuum but the weld isn&#39;t very impressive without a lot of force. Cold welding is also related to another process called galling. Galling is when two metals weld together due to the friction of them sliding against each other. You can get much better results when cold welding if you also slide the pieces together because this creates grooves that give much better contact. Because spacecraft are made on Earth the parts will generally never cold weld (even in a vacuum) because they are already oxidized before they go up. The only way to make most parts cold weld is to slide them against each other and scrape off the oxidation layer and (at the same time) form symmetrical cavities in the two pieces. Then they will cold weld\\gall.", "comment_date": "2021-08-24T16:24:40Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "ClosestNearUtopia", "comment_text": "Its possible here on earth to, use mercury to dissolve gold or some gallium to dissolve some alluminium.", "comment_date": "2021-08-24T14:03:10Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Restoring Reality", "comment_text": "I&#39;m as astounded at how full of $hi+ some people are as I am baffled at how stupid others are?

He couldn&#39;t explain exactly why it was happening but he was confident the solution would work. So I replaced the steel drive nut with a bronze one - never had another problem.

They just had to get the surfaces atomically clean. They did that by using ultra-violent light and spraying pure clean oxygen on the surfaces just before bonding. For the space program though NASA had DuPont develop perfluorocarbon oils and greases. Some of those greases have a vapor pressure around 10E-14 Torr.<br><br><br>I think we need to be able to weld in space using robots so structures larger than what we can launch can be built. Cold welding will not suffice for this because of the cleanness and smoothness required. As for using plastics instead of metals, I guess it will be fine for short missions. But the Long Duration Space Environment Experiment on materials in the 1980s easily showed that plastics degraded more quickly than anticipated.

I&#39;ve been a welder for many years and the explanation just doesn&#39;t add up to me. On the surface of Earth we are at an average of 1 atmosphere, in space there are 0 atmospheres obviously (Vacuum of space also makes no since, there are not negative atmospheres, its an environment without pressure. That&#39;s why pressurized environments are equalized to 0.) so why would that make a difference? I don&#39;t think it does. The ISS&#39;s average outside temp can reach plus or minus 250F which isn&#39;t sufficient enough to conjoin steel. However, with the lack of an atmosphere comes a lack of protection from solar and cosmic radiation which is very present in space. My two sense is telling me that after enough exposure to radiation (steel is a great conductor) the radiation is causing a reaction in the gaps between two steel surfaces, conjoining them. This bond isn&#39;t very strong considering one or two men in space suits managed to brake that bond in the hinges and shut the hatch. Picture this. ] [ &lt;-- those two lines represent the two steel surfaces. They would be tightly fit but there is still a gap between them allowing for movement. Now radiation waves move a lot like sound waves, they would be bouncing and passing through the structure rapidly, but what happens when there is a small space between two surfaces and some radiation waves become &quot;trapped&quot; between. They would bounce off each surface at a rapid rate ]z[ causing heat in turn conjoining the two materials. Of course it wouldn&#39;t be hot to the astronauts, the would be very localized to those specific areas away from the handle and by the time the astronauts would be able to remove their suits (an atmosphere would have to be produced in the shuttle) the heat would be removed from the steel into the now atmosphere remaining virtually undetected.

Modern science currently recognizes four forces of nature: The strong nuclear force, the weak nuclear force, gravity, and electromagnetism.<br>2. In school we are taught that with magnetism, opposite polarities attract and like polarities repel. But inside the arc of a large horseshoe magnet it&#39;s the other way around, like polarities attract and opposite polarities repel. (I have proved this to myself with magnets and anybody with a large horseshoe magnet and two smaller bar magnets can easily prove this to yourself too).<br>3. Charged particles have an associated magnetic field with them.<br>4. Protons and electrons are charged particles and have their associated magnetic fields with them.<br>5. Photons also have both an electric and a magnetic component to them.<br><br>FOUR FORCES OF NATURE DOWN INTO TWO:<br>6. When an electron is in close proximity to the nucleus, it would basically generate a 360 degree spherical magnetic field.<br>7. Like charged protons would stick together inside of this magnetic field, while simultaneously repelling opposite charged electrons inside this magnetic field, while simultaneously attracting the opposite charged electrons across the inner portion of the electron&#39;s moving magnetic field.<br>8. There are probably no such thing as &quot;gluons&quot; in actual reality.<br>9. The strong nuclear force and the weak nuclear force are probably derivatives of the electro-magnetic field interactions between electrons and protons.<br>10. The nucleus is probably an electro-magnetic field boundary.<br>11. Quarks also supposedly have a charge to them and then would also most likely have electro-magnetic fields associated with them, possibly a different arrangement for each of the six different type of quarks.<br>12. The interactions between the quarks EM forces are how and why protons and neutrons formulate as well as how and why protons and neutrons stay inside of the nucleus and do not just pass through as neutrinos do.<br><br>THE GEM FORCE INTERACTIONS AND QUANTA:<br>13. Personally, I currently believe that the directional force in photons is &quot;gravity&quot;.<br>14. I also believe that a pulsating singularity (which is basically a pulsating photon) is the pure energy unit.<br>15. When these pulsating pure energy units interact with other pure energy units, they tangle together. Various shapes (strings, spheres, whatever) might be formed, which then create sub-atomic material, atoms, molecules, and everything in existence in this universe.<br>16. When the pure energy units unite together they would tend to stabilize and vibrate.<br>17. I believe there is probably a Photonic Theory Of The Atomic Structure.<br>18. Everything is basically &quot;light&quot; (photons) in a universe entirely filled with &quot;light&quot; (photons).<br><br>THE MAGNETIC FORCE SPECIFICALLY:<br>19. When the electron with it&#39;s associated magnetic field goes around the proton with it&#39;s associated magnetic field, internal and external energy oscillations are set up.<br>20. When more than one atom is involved, and these energy frequencies align, they add together, specifically the magnetic field frequency.<br>21. I currently believe that this is where a line of flux originates from, aligned magnetic field frequencies.<br><br>NOTES:<br>22. The Earth can be looked at as being a massive singular interacting photon with it&#39;s magnetic field, electrical surface field, and gravity, all three photonic forces all being 90 degrees from each other.<br>23. The flat spiral galaxy can be looked at as being a massive singular interacting photon with it&#39;s magnetic fields on each side of the plane of matter, the electrical field along the plane of matter, and gravity being directed towards the galactic center&#39;s black hole where the gravitational forces would meet, all three photonic forces all being 90 degrees from each other.<br>24. As below in the singularity, as above in the galaxy and probably universe as well.<br>25. I believe there are only two forces of nature, Gravity and EM, (GEM). Due to the stability of the GEM with the pure energy unit, this is also why the forces of nature haven&#39;t evolved by now. Of which with the current theory of understanding, how come the forces of nature haven&#39;t evolved by now since the original conditions acting upon the singularity aren&#39;t acting upon them like they originally were, billions of years have supposedly elapsed, in a universe that continues to expand and cool, with energy that could not be created nor destroyed would be getting less and less dense? My theory would seem to make more sense if in fact it is really true. I really wonder if it is in fact really true.<br>26. And the universe would be expanding due to these pulsating and interacting pure energy units and would also allow galaxies to collide, of which, how could galaxies ever collide if they are all speeding away from each other like is currently taught?<br><br>DISCLAIMER:<br>27. As I as well as all of humanity truly do not know what we do not know, the above certainly could be wrong.
