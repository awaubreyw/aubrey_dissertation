E.g. factual - real places, real characteristics of the place, geography, weather, conditions, danger, wildlife, reasons people even bother to go there, etc.) all real except for the characters and their deeds, though wholly within the realm of plausible. <br><br>This place is VERY inhospitable to humans.    Polar bears are much more comfortable.   Now the Russians and Chinese are spending inordinate amounts of time there with the Chinese trying to find the best location for a Air, Sea base in order to take over the new shipping lanes expected to open over the next 10 to 50 years with melting ice, such that ice breakers and commercial and merchant vessels able to navigate the routes.  I&#39;ve read that the Chinese are keen to exploit the resources of the arctic ocean and, of course, will very likely over fish the natural wealth of sea life in the region, as soon as they can get their giant commercial fishing vessels into the region.   China is, as usual, making ridiculous claims of sovereignty over nearby land masses in order to &#39;justify&#39; their presence and to claim ownership.<br><br>So, the US and NATO better get serious about maintaining our own presence in order to preserve freedom of navigation and to prevent the chinese and others from depleting, nay wasting, the natural resources present there.<br><br>Lots of folks are attacked by Polar Bears out there and at times the only to prevent being eaten is to shoot them, as it turns out that bear spray is too ineffectual with these predators.  Polar bears are truly beautiful, but they stalk incredibly effectively and noises, of all kinds, will simply not scare them off the scent.  Unlike all other bears, only Polar Bears will routinely see humans as a source of food, naturally.   All other bears will either avoid humans entirely or, like the Alaskan Brown Bears (bigger than the Grizzley) will share the resources provided one maintains a very respectful distance from them.   <br><br>Anyway, too cold for anything there except Polar Bears and seals and artic fox and certain rodents.   Svalbard&#39;s weather routinely sees massive storms with winds of hurricane strength, together with temperature extremes.   Climate change does not mean man-made global warming.   The climate on earth has always been cyclical.   Volcano eruptions release so-called greenhouse gasses in volume that is many, many times the amount of the same gasses that human behavior is capable of releasing.", "comment_date": "2021-10-18T20:50:45Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Johnny Sigma", "comment_text": "Good videography.", "comment_date": "2021-10-18T18:55:09Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Rishav Kumar Singh", "comment_text": "YouTube recommended me this after 5 years", "comment_date": "2021-10-18T09:18:50Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "gianluca piatta", "comment_text": "Yeah looking an happy  town", "comment_date": "2021-10-18T05:15:36Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Joshua Patrick", "comment_text": "Ah yes polar Bears..the only land animal<br>That activity Hunts humans.", "comment_date": "2021-10-18T01:44:06Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "D.B.

What I really liked MOST about your video is every few seconds you stop talking you pause so that allows me to see what you&#39;re filming. To enjoy the landscape that surrounds you. Thank you! Your music choice was excellent throughout your video. I live in Texas the odds of my wife and I travel north to Longyearbyen is slim to none. I just hope that humans don&#39;t destroy Longyearbyen.

We took a trip on snowmobiles to a nearby settlement called Barentsburg, 30 minutes away. Barentsburg is a Russian settlement and ghost town that was abounded after the price of coal went down. It was really surreal. My dad was a miner in mine number 7 and my mother a cleaning lady in mine number 3, and they and my older brother and sister spend a huge chunk of their lives there. My mum and dad still comes back every now and then to visit old neighbours and friends. Spitsbergen is one of those places you just can&#39;t look at pictures of, you have to see it for yourself. The town is located at the end of a glacier (which you can go under), and the most fun you will ever have is when you rent a snowmobile and drive down the glacier. The nature around the town is the most interesting part of it all. <br><br>Fun fact:<br><br>Since milk has a short expiration date, it has to be sent by air to the local shop, instead of the cheaper method of boat.
