The current model of QM is flawed. Readjust the model and you don&#39;t need insane things like dark matter. What is one of the adjustment you ask? For starters, the idea that subatomic particles, like electrons, have a magnetic field in the shape of a dipole, like a bar magnet, it wrong. The shape of the magnetic N and S poles are actually a type of paraboloid. You can see the shapes all over the place in space. Take a look at the Sun&#39;s solar flares, what shape do they make? A paraboloid type shape. Take a look at the shape of various energy sublevels of electrons, i.e. s, p, d and f,  you see the paraboloid shape all over the place. If you readjust the bar magnet style of magnetic fields to the paraboloid shape, it shows how dark matter isn&#39;t needed at all.", "comment_date": "2022-09-12T13:37:52Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Nestor Silva", "comment_text": "Muon detectors use comic sans.", "comment_date": "2022-09-12T05:56:36Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Lux et Mathematica", "comment_text": "If virtually no stars collide when galaxies collide, why would the majority of the gas of two clusters collide such that they actually slow down?

Honestly that might be the bigger goal needed atm as well it&#39;s slowly being destroyed by us. Insect populations are decreasing by 40% and they&#39;re part of the building blocks that sustain most life.

I think we&#39;ve advanced heavily over the past century and are still advancing in astronomy and astrophysics even. Actually I think we&#39;ve been been advancing in many areas. We now know of more hominid groups and have better accuracy of when modern humans started to roam and when we truly made the great migration. Our technology is getting faster and more advanced that some of our old sci-fi themes in movies have become a reality even closer to it more and more. Virtual Reality, flying cars, Hover boards (even tested by Tony Hawks), and even robotics. A lot of these advances still aren&#39;t common practice but with more time they may become common place. In essence advances 20 to 40 years ago we&#39;d call science fiction is becoming more a reality. We&#39;ve even taken pictures of a black hole. I have faith that one day they&#39;ll solve the mysteries of dark matter. Maybe we can&#39;t see it because it&#39;s so small or very few or maybe we can&#39;t see it out their because light does reflect off of it which we actually need light to see anything. This means that measuring temperature was a reasonable way to see what we can&#39;t with our eyes alone. In terms though could Super massive black holes hold galaxies together themselves like our sun holds our solar system together and in our heliosphere.

Sooner or later science will come to the conclusion that photons actually DO have mass, and that the &#39;dark matter&#39; is actually photons. Perhaps ironically, photons are dark, invisible. You can only see the SOURCE of photons, or things they illuminate. I suspect that one day scientists will agree that when photons are first emitted from stars and other sources, they&#39;re pure energy, but over long periods of time they &#39;condense&#39; into particles that have mass. This way the universe renews from energy to mass. There are a LOT of photons emitted by a galaxy. By the time these photons reach a couple hundred light years from each star, they have condensed to have some mass, and this &#39;wave&#39; in the mass-profile of the photon-stream becomes extremely massive, exerting a gravitational effect on the outer parts of the galaxy, exactly where we see apparent anomalies in the motion of stars. That photon-wave, being far enough from the galaxy to have had time to form mass, but close enough to exert gravitational influence, forms a kind of invisible envelope of mass around the galaxy. When you see &#39;gravitational lensing&#39;, it&#39;s not because photons are tracking around the entirely conceptual &#39;curved fabric of space time&#39;, it&#39;s because their mass is attracted to massive objects by the very well-known force of gravity. Light &#39;bends&#39; around massive objects because it is subject to gravity, because it has mass - it&#39;s not complicated.

This spinning room makes you feel as though as giant invisible hand is pressing on your chest and limbs. This creates forces of up to 3G but the direction you are pushed is not to the side but straight bac from the centre. Think of this in reverse for the earth, where, unlike our faces that want to slide off, electrons are pulled back to the centre of their atom at a greater force, thus creating a directional force.<br><br>If you can imagine this centrifugal attractive force gains greater strength the more billions of trillions of atoms all moving in the same direction all pulling each other and maintaining a stable momentum would be many times stronger or weaker depending on the mass of a massive, spinning spatial body. This could be what gravity is, many atoms trying to maintain equilibrium while being flung at high speed through a frictionless universe. The denser the mass, the stronger the pull as more electrons travel to stay with their nucleus. The further away the electrons are flung, the stronger the force to pull them back, and of course the larger the diametre of the mass, the faster the surface spins, the denser the mass, the greater the exponential power of the directional pull towards the centre of mass.<br><br>I don&#39;t know how much gravity this theory holds, but it&#39;s my way of understanding gravity and the science on it is still grey so it&#39;s still anyone&#39;s guess.", "comment_date": "2022-07-28T21:10:55Z", "likes_count": 3}, {"comment_by": "Scott Shaffer", "comment_text": "Would you discuss Milgromian Dynamics (MOND)?", "comment_date": "2022-07-28T20:50:44Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Paul Miller", "comment_text": "When the classical equations didn&#39;t fit the observations why didn&#39;t they write equations that do describe what they saw?.", "comment_date": "2022-07-28T20:32:09Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "TheTruth About Science and God", "comment_text": "Please share with other people my two brief videos.

(Maybe we need a new aged Antikythera Mechanism). Compounded, how fast are we really going anyways? What if the Universe is moving too, Could we not extrapolate what we know from what we don&#39;t in order to determine the &#39;Speed Of The Universe&#39;? Maybe that&#39;s what gives light it&#39;s speed limit. Surely we must then be traveling fast enough to cause some form of &#39;Time Dilation&#39;?

In relatively high mass regions of spacetime, which is a thing familiar to us humans, living inside of a solar system, within a galaxy, as we do, things are relatively flat and well grounded, with dips corresponding to intense gravitational concentrations (planets, stars, black holes, etc.), with the steepest dips belonging to the most gravitationally intense objects. What about areas of spacetime not nailed down by gravitational objects of sufficient size and quantity? We might assume it would be the same there also, but maybe not. Perhaps spacetime leavens or billows upwards, ever so slightly, in areas of low mass, with larger expanses of low mass spacetime seeing a correspondingly more pronounced effect. What would this positively curved spacetime do? Well, at slighter curvatures, it could cause a gravitationally repulsive effect all along the curve, pushing together things like galaxies, which exist on the edges of such positively curved spacetime, thus accounting for the effects we attribute to dark matter. In deeper voids, such the the spaces between galaxy clusters, the positive curvature could create sufficient repulsive effect, that new spacetime is diffusely created over the intervening parsecs. This would be like a white hole, but extremely diffuse, albeit still very noticeable on the vast scales of the universe. This could account for what we see in dark energy. So there you have it. Both dark energy and dark matter explained by the ever-so-slightly positive curvature of spacetime in regions of low mass, where it billows outwards like a sail, with no points of mass to nail it down. This could also explain the inflation of the early Universe and the trigger for the big bang itself, as not so much an explosion, but a rapid entropic dissipation into newly formed spacetime brought into existence by positive curvature (low mass) outside of the initial concentration of matter-energy.", "comment_date": "2022-07-22T19:28:50Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Steven Verrall", "comment_text": "Ghosts and spirits may also exist and be undetectable with scientific intruments.

That\u2019s just one example.

Instead of inventing a matter, I believe it\u2019s far more plausible that supermassive black holes are responsible for why galaxies don\u2019t fly apart and conducting much more intensive studies of supermassive black holes may help us better understand the phenomena. <br><br>Clearly I am no physicist, nor do I study astronomy or cosmology.

The fact they have to keep changing their def of what dark matter is to explain why they don&#39;t ever find it and how impossibly ridiculous it is reminds me of a discussion I once saw about how religions had to keep changing the idea of god as human discoveries changed. First it was gods lived in a cave, but when humans went into caves and didn&#39;t see any gods the gods were moved to a top of a hill. When humans climbed the hill and saw no gods the gods were moved to the top of a mountain. When humans climbed the mountain and found no gods the gods were moved into the sky. When humans invented airplanes and even spaceships gods were moved outside of space and time. Looks exactly like dark matter.

But it doesn&#39;t matter what type of galaxy it is. It doesn&#39;t matter if it is big or small, what the shape of the spirals are, the distribution of stars, what galaxies are next to it, whether it is in a big cluster or more isolated, absolutely nothing makes a difference - the galaxy always has the <b>exact</b> right amount of Dark Matter with the <b>exact</b> right distribution to perfectly have enough to prevent the stars from flying away and perfectly have not so much that they spiral inwards.

If dark matter only interacts gravitationally, that means it interacts gravitationally with itself too, no? If so then it would collapse into its equivalent of black holes and stars. Since there&#39;s so much more of it, it would make black holes at a much faster rate than regular matter. In fact, regular matter would pool into the spacetime holes made by dark matter like water into a puddle.<br> <br>2. All spherical celestial bodies (black holes, neutron stars, stars, planets, moons) would lie at the center of a dark matter blob since that is where the regular matter is being pooled. Meaning that our own planet is experiencing the gravity of dark matter right now. So the strength of gravity from regular matter would be a lot less than we think it is and would need to be subtracted from the dark matter blob.<br> <br>3. But that just puts us back to square one, since the original estimates for distant galaxies were made by what we thought the gravitational strength of regular matter was. We just went in a circle.<br> <br>I think the more likely possibility is that there is a mistake in what we are perceiving and measuring.

Perhaps a lower angle of incidence gives a higher detection rate as the muons are travelling through more of the detector plate material. Therefore less muons would sneak past detection in winter when the incidence angle with the sun is lower, therefore more muons from the sun are accounted for, therefore more detection clashes with the DM detector, therefore less &quot;other particle&quot; detections in winter. This would only account for daytime detection though, however in winter there is also more of the Earths surface for muons from the sun to travel through to hit the rear of the experiment at night time.

Of course matter and anti matter annihilate upon contact, so this would need to be on a galactic scale,  or even clusters of galaxies... the point being, this interaction of different matter types would really never be seen in nature since not only do they annihilate, but they also repel. <br><br>a way to visualize this would be the standard stretched cloth experiment, except instead, the anti-matter in the system would be represented by a ball with vastly increased buoyancy (it floats upwards) which is placed under the sheet. of course in a normal stretched cloth experiment the gravity &quot;well&quot; is formed by placing a large mass in the middle of the sheet, thus repelling this &quot;antimatter&quot; <br><br>this would for the most part, behave exactly as normal, however in areas where antimatter exists, the sheet would be deformed inversely pushing up on the cloth, creating a kind of &#39;negative&#39; gravity, repelling the regular matter (or at least trying to, the visualization is imperfect in many ways) this &quot;antimatter&quot; would eventually roll &quot;upwards&quot; towards the outside of the sheet.<br><br>HOWEVER in an antimatter based gravity well (which in the cloth experiment, could be represented by sticking a pole under the sheet causing a spike pointing upwards. this would allow antimatter to work just like regular matter would in the original version, only &quot;upside down&quot;, instead with objects interacting with the cloth on the underside. they would be attracted to the gravity of an antimatter gravitational system...<br><br><br>I think the interactions between these hypothetical &quot;positive and negative galaxies&quot; would be incredibly difficult to spot, since the distance, size and mass of galaxies are incomprehensible to me at least. and all of the &quot;good stuff&quot; would have happened billions of years ago, leaving a universe of segregated antimatter and matter galaxies gradually drifting apart.<br><br>I also understand that the stretched cloth experiment is an incredibly basic three dimensional visualisation of what is really four dimensional curved spacetime. And I understand this is the wildest speculation based on nothing but a random idea. <br><br>I also am aware humans can create (incredibly small amounts of) anti-protons, But am fairly sure its nowhere near enough to detect any kind of gravitational attraction or repulsion to confirm or deny this idea.<br><br>is there a way the interaction between galaxies could confirm or refute this? maybe its already been refuted decades ago by people far far smarter than I could ever hope to be. Perhaps these are the wild ramblings of an uneducated lout. <br><br>I think if this was even remotely a &quot;thing&quot; it might go some way towards explaining some oddness in the way galaxies interact in the universe... but again I&#39;m just an uneducated lout with a mediocre high school education.<br><br>PS, I&#39;m not sure how light would interact with this kind of system I thunked up off the top of my head, perhaps photons don&#39;t work in the same way because anti-photons are just photons? so the photons emitted or gravitationally &quot;bent&quot; are affected the same whether its a +galaxy or a -galaxy<br><br>please don&#39;t &quot;come @ me bro&quot;...

It is the primordial material of the universe and it flows into the center of galaxies which happen to have supermassive blackholes, each and every one of them. Galaxies are formed when this invisible matter interacts with black holes to create protons which are visible matter. Voila! So actually this is a process of galaxy creation which ultimately reduces the black hole, effectively reducing the interaction with dark matter. So some galaxies will &#39;appear&#39; to have less dark matter than others but actually it is always ambient just interacting less. As for what particle is dark matter made of, I say simply electron-positron pairs. That&#39;s the primordial mesh/matrix that defines our universe. Ever wondered why electrons seem to be everywhere all the time? So easy to invoke in our electronic world. We have to realize that we don&#39;t really comprehend basic concepts such as gravity, charge and light. Our assumptions is what is making dark matter elusive. But our observations assembled that is; gravitational lensing, the fact that there are black holes at centers of galaxies, the fact that positive charge is mostly stationary while negative charge is easily mobile in our universe all come into play. That is to say that black holes are the only true vacuums while the rest of the universe attempts to fill them causing &#39;gravity&#39; and also any true vacuum is a positive charge because it represents immovable charge and vice versa. So, a positron, a proton, a positive ion, all these are or contain miniature black holes. Making the electron the only true particle of our universe. And lastly, dark matter(which I also call Aether) seems &#39;invisible&#39; because it is actually transparent and is the medium that carries/transmits light (electromagnetic waves), magnetic lines, gravitational waves and blackbody radiation.

Just one grating error that I caught and didn&#39;t see anyone else catch at <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6etTERFUlUI&amp;t=1m42s\">1:42</a>. The pie chart with the dark matter and ordinary matter shows &quot;5x&quot; beneath it and you say that there&#39;s 5x more dark matter than ordinary matter when you showed the chart. However your chart actually shows a smaller ratio of dark matter to ordinary matter. Because of the particular ratio and the fact that you&#39;ve represented it as a pie chart it&#39;s actually pretty obvious the ratio is wrong if you know what to look for in the visual (I won&#39;t get into the details now but there are some easy techniques you can use to see that it&#39;s not right without having to measure anything). The angle on the slice representing Ordinary Matter should be 60\u00b0, meaning the pie chart could be broken up into 6 equal-sized pieces where 5 of them are Dark Matter and 1 is Ordinary Matter giving a 5:1 ratio Dark to Ordinary Matter. I measured the angle in GeoGebra and found it to be 72\u00b0, meaning your pie chart shows a 4x ratio instead of a 5x ratio.<br><br>Pie charts are designed to show parts of a whole. This is either the result of a simple mistake (forgetting that your pie chart should represent a whole equal to 6 identical pieces to make a 5:1 ratio) or it&#39;s a misuse of a pie chart. The total area of the circle is 5x the size of the piece of Ordinary Matter and if the slice of Ordinary Matter had been shown side-by-side with the circle representing all Dark Matter it would be fair because there would be no mistaking the visual ratio. But a pie chart, by design, represents the total of all of its parts and so you are presenting a visual with a 4:1 ratio (with 5 equal sized slices, one representing Ordinary Matter and four representing Dark Matter).<br><br>In all fairness the auditory and visual clues saying 5x should be enough to have avoided misinforming viewers of the ratio, but the visual&#39;s impact was diminished by the misrepresentation of the ratio which is unfortunate.<br><br>---<br><br>I&#39;m sure the other commentors aren&#39;t going to be thrilled with what may sound like a pedantic whine on my part, but I will mention that I am a huge fan of the channel and this is the first time in several years of watching that I have caught an error like this. I have long been thoroughly impressed with the work done by Derek and Veritasium both and I also appreciate that they are also prepared to admit when they&#39;re wrong as Derek has mentioned in previous videos. Nobody&#39;s perfect, and this one small error really reflects our imperfections as humans. No I&#39;m not whining, the scientific community thrives on tremendous work that is refined through peer review where errors, big and small, are caught and brought to the attention of the reviewees.

A doctrine through which one can look at the universe. It is no more or less factual than any other perspective, but it is just that. A way of thinking about the universe. Not a static reality of the universe.

There is a significant amount of stars in the galactic rim that would cause other stars to be pulled towards them. The ridiculous massiveness of galaxies mean that we cannot assume that it is a singular gravitational object to those inside of the galaxy. As the stars travel they would also be pulling the stars behind them in a gravitational slingshot. An example star can be making it&#39;s way towards the galactic rim.

The importance of this is significant to our base understanding of the Universe, obviously. As the current science stands, the realization that temporal flow gives the appearance of gravitic forces, is the keystone of my point. The flexure, stretching and condensing of time would neatly account for many of the behaviors seen in galaxies, such as their rotational congruence.

As matter was forming it is helpful to think that it just didn&#39;t form randomly with no precursor but rather formed where there was a &#39;forming agent&#39; such as a slight dip in the energy of space at that point. So it formed in a mini gravity well that was inherent in space in the very early stages of the Universe. As the Universe began to age these mini gravity wells containing fundamental particles combined into larger gravity wells containing more fundamental particles. To an entity like us who see using visible light it would appear that the particles are creating gravity, whereas what I&#39;m saying is that space energy wells is the source of gravity. Taking this a lot further it would seem reasonable to expect a lot more space energy wells or mini gravity wells that would outnumber particles by some factor. This would look like dark matter. To summarise this would mean that gravity wells would combine into larger and larger gravity wells of space, some containing matter and some not. This would lead to the formation of galaxies we see today. In other words it is not matter that was the cause of galaxies but the combining of space gravity wells that took matter with them and the excess of space gravity wells containing no matter over space gravity wells containing matter would represent dark matter.", "comment_date": "2022-06-05T21:32:03Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Norbs Silva", "comment_text": "Se a mat\u00e9ria escura for perceptiva pelos olhar humano, por exemplo !?.<br>Em uma condi\u00e7\u00e3o, absolutamente pessoal.

I&#39;d like to share a model that could provide a workable explanation. No pretension on my part. Here&#39;s some postulates: 1. &quot;Local&quot; gravity seems to be an expression of dark matter; it is a force. 2. imagine gravity as a &quot;push&quot; toward the center of Earth, instead of a &quot;pull&quot;. 3. This push is akin to fluid (air or water) pressure; it&#39;s omnipresent, but it is invisible and rather intangible. 4. this dark matter is everywhere in the universe, and only permeate matter to some degree - the deeper underground you get, the less is the effect of dark matter&#39;s pressure.*Run a vectorial analysis of classic  gravitational force, at the surface of Earth, with lessening grav force as you move down a tunnel towards Earth&#39;s centre and both models work just the same. Dead center and you have zero resultant forces; either push or pull. 5. At t(0) big bang, the pressure (like an exploding balloon) was immense, radially diminishing as time goes, but it is  still (nowadays) putting pressure outward on each galaxies; and that accounts for Doppler-effect confirmed accelerations. 6. That pressure is caused by something that&#39;s non-matter (massless) against all matter, would seem to account also for why galaxies &quot;hold together&quot; - oddities. Also considering angular momentum and centrifugal forces that won&#39;t ad up to the canon of physics. See, it is not a &quot;missing mass&quot; in the calculations, but the presence of an omnipresent, unseen, unperceived pressure against all matter, that does the trick. Take a large rubber red weather balloon (like I happily used to send off), fill it out with blue died air, and strobe-photograph its bursting. Plot the velocity of the blue gas expansion (in a true vacuum) versus time and you will see the same effect we see in the expansion of our universe. Every tiny aggregates of blue die liquid is pushed together by air pressure (not gravity), in very tiny clusters (galaxies). These &quot;galaxies&quot; move away from each other following something very much like a &quot;biological growth curve&quot; or an &quot;S&quot; shaped curve, reaching a top constant velocity - but the universe has not leveled off yet! 7. We have an inkling of this &quot;dark pressure&quot; with the Casimir force.<br>8.  Aside from &quot;flavored&quot; neutrinos (those endowed with mass) the vast majority of them are massless. All photons are massless, but funny enough they behave like they have mass when energized as light and travels in the proximity of a large mass (light bending around a planet). Yeah I believe these critters (muons and/or photons) have a close relationship to dark pressure or, most likely, they compose dark matter - dark pressure. Eh my friend, I do research in renewable energy (electro-magnetics), but are we having fun yet? I&#39;d be honored to have your input on that. Yes, feel free to say I&#39;m completely off the mark.

Time should run slightly faster in intergalactic space, so expansion should happen faster there, which in turn should further increase the rate of timeflow. It\u2019s a positive feedback effect, and it explains the huge bubble-like voids that show up in deep-space surveys, with galaxies concentrated as walls and strands between adjacent pairs and clusters of voids. Under this explanation, these structures happen not because galaxies have some freaky property that causes them to form walls and strands, but because the faster-expanding bubbles leave galaxies behind, concentrated in the denser geometrical features that form between the expanding voids.<br>\r<br><br>Nonlinearity makes the inertial properties of a galaxy&#39;s masses behave in a more self-contained manner, with external references having a reduced effect. The outer edges of a rotating galaxy then don\u2019t feel themselves to be rotating as quickly as we reason they must be with respect to outside systems, and there\u2019s a reduced centrifugal effect trying to fling that matter outwards. We then also expect increased lensing effects for galaxies, with an increased field-differential caused not by the gravitational flux-density being increased inside the lensing objects, but being decreased outside. \r<br><br><br><br>The advantage of invoking nonlinearity is that it explains what we see, from first principles, without having to invent new invisible entities that have different rules.<br>The advantage of invoking dark matter is that hypothesising something &quot;new&quot; to explain the gap between what current theory predicts and what we actually measure is often psychologically easier than saying, &quot;Hey, maybe the evidence is simply telling us that our current theory is wrong and needs some changes!&quot;.   <br><br>In theory, theoretical physicists love to be proved wrong. <br>In practice, some of them are too culturally and emotionally committed to whatever version of physics theory was dominant when they took their degrees to be able to even consider the idea that what they were taught might not be entirely correct.", "comment_date": "2022-06-04T18:16:09Z", "likes_count": 4}, {"comment_by": "Hostel Cooking", "comment_text": "What&#39;s the actual signal they are measuring?", "comment_date": "2022-06-04T18:14:50Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Pierre Bour", "comment_text": "Very interesting!

On the contrary, the multiverse is the infinite sum of all discrete info(bits) aka possibilities, but again it&#39;s all discrete and at equilibrium, sorta like an memory or an idea.  The kinetic world via the literal force of life and conciousness has transference with this multiverse in equilibrium .  The transference is that life brings discrete info of its own set for it to &quot;react&quot; in our kinetic world.   The transference in the other direction tho only serves to expand the discrete info in the multiverse because it cannot react there it is all at equilibrium even as it expands. This makes our kinetic universe seemingly unpredictable yet probably 100% predictable save for it&#39;s too complealx, like a lorenze attractor built from fractal functions not differential equations.  This is because the transference between discrete life in the kinetic universe creates time simply because iterations of new life dictates time exist because the set of info in the kinetic world is always limited in the moment and it&#39;s ever changing, thus also infinite because the changes never repeat exactly.  In our kinetic universe there is only an assurance nothing stays exactly the same.  Lastly, the only force that exists is life.  The life force is the unified force.  Everything we see including gravity is simply a result of or a manifestation of life.  An analogy I can use to relay this idea is matter states.  Think of H2O as life-force and think of the other forces as just the various states of H20.  Gravity is vapor, electromagnetic force is liquid water, the weak nuclear force is a solid state of matter.    FYI, this is metaphor for the idea of life as the single force in the universe,.I am not equating these other forces literally with states of H2O or matter in general.<br><br>Lastly, the reason this is happening is because of the infinite nature of the multiverse that exists in equilibrium.  Whilst it&#39;s in equilibrium it also expands.  It expands because it&#39;s a library of discrete info that life gathers in the kinetic universe.  As discrete life interacts and changes it&#39;s environment and then new iterations of life must interelact with said new environment so the info they gather is different.  As this progresses both the kinetic and equilibrium universes expand.  We create the info the multiverse verse archives it.  Now again, why?  EXACTLY!!!!! The combination of the multiverse and the kinetic universe amounts to an algorithm trying to figure out what is going on and why.  All discrete life in the kinetic universe is a &quot;limited&quot; instance of said algorthim that is tasked to iiterate thru the ever changing substrate created its own transference with itself.  This gives new discrete info to the multiverse so it expands giving new info for new iterations in the kinetic world....all to figure out what is going on.   It&#39;s like it all exists as a thought in the mind of God but God is a newborn baby thrown into an unknown reality it needs to figure out.  In the end this is a sissyphean task for both god and us and hopefully we will recognize that one day based off the fact humans one day conclude something similar to what im saying.", "comment_date": "2022-06-04T11:32:29Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "kirby march barcena", "comment_text": "I am not lost, yet you continuously search for me out of curiousity.<br><br>-Dark Matter", "comment_date": "2022-06-04T11:32:06Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Sly Sly", "comment_text": "Great video as usual.

The ether sits wholly as Electron Orbital Shells which surround everything in universe and beyond. Electron Valance Shells are more or less same as Electron Orbital Shells so they will be called EOSs too. EOSs are pressure gradients; 2 8 18 32 50..and so forth. These numbers are pressures of the EOS layers and are measured in Volts. Volts are ether pressure measurements. These pressure gradients generate force of buoyancy which then push things within from higher pressure towards the centers of EOSs where pressure is lowest. This is gravity. <br><br>The Electron Orbital Shells are made of 2 things: ether pressure layers and magnetic field skins which separate the ether layers. MF Shells also keep the inside ether in and outside ether out. This is why Michelson and Morley couldnt find ether flowing over earth. Magnetic fields have the same shape except the MF Shells are moving unidirectionally where as regular EOSs move omnidirectionally. <br><br>So the space time diagram would look like a 3D topological map. You can draw in arrows indicating the direction of buoyancy, i.e. direction of gravity which moves from higher pressure ether layer to lower, like a meteorological map, and you would have what you seek. \ud83d\ude09", "comment_date": "2022-06-04T08:12:55Z", "likes_count": 2}, {"comment_by": "Loreee_", "comment_text": "Gran Sasso is not a mountain in the Alps, is in the Appennine.

Nothing more than space-time pushing back to its purposeful position as matter forces the space-time mesh apart in various amounts depending on density and size of said matter.  This force of stretching the space-time mesh does not only effect the immediate space around the matter, but instead pushes space-time into other space far beyond the source of mass in a domino effect proportionate to the density and size of the matter.  The chain of effect is far, FAR greater than you seem to imagine, and can not be compared to any Earthly model outside of theoretical physics.  Nothing like waves of liquid, gas, or invisible waves of any spectrum.  Space-time mesh has its own physics where every single other part of physics is merely complimentary and simply allowed by the base physics of space-time.  Therefore, I say, there is no such thing as dark matter.  Only widely misunderstood variables everyone keeps assuming are factual enough to build theories from.  Nothing else is needed when you come to understand the physics of space-time\u2019s effects on it\u2019s self more factually and clear.

What if: the whole universe is empty fabric of space with no physics/time called Neutral balanced Gravity. Physics only exist when matter is present in space/time.  AntiGravity is Dark matter. Let me explain. Let say we have an area of space with matter. Lets say the matter produces 9.81 units of gravity. Remember, there is a Neutral balance gravity in all of space. Neutral balanced Gravity = gravity + antimatter. They say that for every unit of gravity, there is x5 times more antigravity. With our example Neutral balanced Gravity = 9.81+ (9.81x5)= 58.86. So antigravity is 58.86 - 9.81= 49.05. Why cant we measure antigravity? Space time creates antigravity/darkmatter to keep a  Neutral balanced Gravity. Why would the universe want anything to interact with antimatter, when it does not need to. If antimatter were to interact with matter than gravity would not be stable. It always look to balance out to Neutral Balance Gravity. In a super nova, in the center of the explosion, all of matter scatters out, no matter. No matter creates a black hole or a patch of nothing. So no physics exist in that patch. when regular matter touches that patch, it is balanced out to become Neutral gravity. It transforms gravity back to antigravity thus Neutral balanced Gravity.

It is more like 50-100 billion years.  This removes the need for an unprovable inflation theory.  It also allows for several generations of stars needed to create all the heavy elements.  If the early universe was much smaller and denser, there would have been many large stars that went super nova.  If only 60% of the mass goes on to reform the next generation of stars then 40% of each generation becomes cold dark ordinary matter.  After three or four generations of star formation only about 15% of the original mass of the universe would still be luminous. The rest is cold, dark ordinary matter which would be invisible to our telescopes but could be detected by the gravity it exerts.  So there is no need for exotic dark matter or dark energy theories, just a longer timeline.  Current observations are also complicated by gravitational lensing which would have been extreme in the early universe. Most of what we observe probably doesn&#39;t even exist now nor is it anywhere near where it was. <br>My second theory is that the universe is much younger and exists in at least three dimensions which all coexist in the same space and affect each other.

If the galaxy is a disc like you show here the dark matter would not be in a sphere around us like this shows. Due to gravity, which is the only thing we know interacts with dark matter, the dark matter shape around us would reflect the shape of the disc, not be around it like a cloud evenly. We do not think there is 5x dark matter compared to matter, we think 68.3 % is dark energy the stuff making the galaxy expand aka dark energy and 26.8% is dark matter that holds our around galaxy causing galaxies to spin faster then they should. These two functions are extremely different, dark energy causes the expansion of the universe, while dark matter actually prevents dark energy from taking over holds galaxy together and prevents them from expanding in local areas. Even your measurement of how fast the star is moving is a guess humans haven&#39;t had telescopes and means to measure our movement long enough to make a good measurement saying it is 220km/s is the best guess right now but that error bar is huge.

So I can imagine you can identify. The irony is that the thing in your mind that allows you to entertain bad science. Is also the thing that allows you to recognize extraordinary science. What you have demonstrated on multiple occasions. But that no one seems to have noticed. Because they seem like they&#39;re just a normal video. But what you&#39;re demonstrating are the literal secrets of the universe. And I think they don&#39;t know. Because you don&#39;t actually know. You just know it as a common effect. Not why it&#39;s actually happening.\r<br>\r<br>The thing is. I think your subconscious does pick that up. Because the way you&#39;re interested in an narrowly mundane feature of the universe. Without exactly knowing why. Tells me your subconscious is at least aware of it.\r<br>\r<br>Which means you have at some point come to the correct realization and dismissed it. Which is truly unfortunate. Because your voice is so much louder than most.\r<br>\r<br>Now you might think well. I&#39;m just some crazy person. And to be honest I&#39;m not sure. You might be right. But if there was only one sane person in a crazy world. How many people would it take to screw in a lightbulb..\r<br>\r<br>But to be honest. I&#39;m not hating on this bad science. Like the fact that it is bad science. Yes of course. But it has the opportunity to be good and real science. But as you can see. The LHC scrood the pooch on that one. Giving all further science discoveries a total bad name. Now how can any scientific discoveries be trusted. Or thought of as legit.\r<br>\r<br>And now the same thing will happen to any high-profile scientific experiment. And are nowgoing to have the same problem. Where no one will believe them. Is this real science.? Or is this some s*** people are saying to justify the cost.!\r<br>\r<br>But that&#39;s not even the real problem.!\r<br>\r<br>The real problem is now stupid people will think that there is an actual higgs particle. Which is utilized as a force carrier. \ud83d\ude02\r<br>\r<br>I mean. Make up whatever we want I gess. Lol\r<br>\r<br>That&#39;s going to be a real problem when it comes time for the higgs particle or mechanism to be utilized.\r<br>\r<br>And I&#39;m sure that&#39;s something they thought of before thinking to pretend they found something. But I&#39;m sure they were like. &quot;Well it&#39;ll probably be like a couple hundred years before the technology comes around to prove that we are totally LYING are f*<b>*</b> asses off.&quot;\r<br>\r<br>So I&#39;m sure they feel safe. But if &quot;they&quot; (whoever &quot;they&quot; are.) Knew what I know. I guarantee they would have come up with a different lie.\r<br>\r<br>But it&#39;s already too late. They can&#39;t unbake that cake. And now we are stuck with bad science. Thanks LHC.!!!!\r<br>\r<br>I mean eventually when we get orbit sized colliders. With some real mind-boggling energy levels. The truth will finally be revealed. \r<br>\r<br>But damn to wait hundreds of years to be vindicated. Well I guess I&#39;m in good company.\r<br>\r<br>I just keep thinking about the dark ages. How much further could we be ahead. If humanity hadn&#39;t been held back or set back so many times in human history.\r<br>\r<br>And here we are still making the same mistakes. Dude if I have to wait a couple hundred years. That&#39;s going to f*<b>*</b> suck.\r<br>\r<br>Come on guys it&#39;s really pretty simple. I given you All the answers..\r<br>\r<br>Just be aware that whatever this thing detect&#39;s. If it detects anything at all. It&#39;s not dark matter.!!!\r<br>\r<br>I mean for one thing. If you were trying to detect dark matter where do you think you would put it. You think underground would be the best place.? Lol obviously if you were answer is yes. Then you&#39;re not using your brain.\r<br>\r<br>That&#39;s what I&#39;m saying. All the answers are here. You just have to figure them out. I mean I&#39;m not going to tell you the answer is 4. But if you know the facts are 2+2. I think you should be able to pick the ball up and run right.?\r<br>\r<br>Let&#39;s just take what we know about dark matter for a moment.. it interacts with other matter through gravity. With just that fact alone. Where would you imagine the most gravity to exist near earth is.\r<br>\r<br>My first thought would be the sun. My second thought would be jupiter. My third thought would be earth itself.\r<br>\r<br>Now obviously as far as I&#39;m aware. We haven&#39;t sent any detectors to either of those two locations. So Earth is the only acceptable option.\r<br>\r<br>Which means that if you were going to put a dark matter detector on Earth. Where&#39;s the place you might want to go to detect the most dark matter.\r<br>\r<br>Would it be in the center of the planet. Would it be just underground. Would it be on the surface of the planet. Or would it be in orbit.?\r<br>\r<br>Lol got ya that&#39;s a trick question.\r<br>\r<br>Obviously we&#39;ve already deduced that we&#39;re trying to put this on the planet. However dark matter will accumulate at point of highest gravitational influence. And that is at the l1 LaGrange point. Which contains a large fraction of the gravity well from both planetary bodies. The earth and the moon.\r<br>\r<br>But as I said earlier it&#39;s only going to be on the earth. So. What is the highest gravitational influence location on the planet Earth. I would go ahead and speculate it is the very top of Mount everest.\r<br>\r<br>It could be somewhere else. But that actually seems unlikely. Simply due to the fact that Mount Everest is one of the heaviest objects floating on the planet size ocean of magma. Which means there is even more mass of Rock that you are not seeing. Support the height that Mount Everest reaches. As an iceberg. The bigger or higher an iceberg is out of the water. The bigger it is under the water.\r<br>\r<br>For the same reason. You can think of Mount Everest as being that largest iceberg. Containing more mass. Which would then generate more gravity.\r<br>\r<br>Number one. The most gravity on the planet Earth is on the surface of the planet. And nowhere else. Not underground. Not up in the atmosphere. Right at the surface of the planet. #2. If you&#39;re going to try to detect a dark matter on the surface of the planet you should go where there is the most gravity. Which should be at Mount everest.\r<br>\r<br>So as soon as they were talking about placing the detector anywhere but where I&#39;ve just described. They were already wrong.\r<br>\r<br>But they&#39;re still not going to detect anything because what they&#39;re looking for is incorrect. And does not actually exist. And I&#39;m not talking about virtual particle type existence. Where they might as well not exist. It&#39;s a figment of their imagination. And does not actually exist at all in any time or point in reality. Except for in their own imagination.\r<br>\r<br>And yes I see the irony in that statement. But I assure you dark matter does exist. But it is mostly not in the place you are looking. And you&#39;re looking for the wrong thing.\r<br>\r<br>And see right there that&#39;s real good science. Even if the result was negative and they found nothing at all. At which point. They then they gained information. And that is the existence of science. That is its whole purpose and reason of science being a concept in the humanities zeitgeist. It is just a mechanism designed to answer questions about existence. And that&#39;s really all Science is. &quot;The pursuit Of Truth&quot;\r<br>\r<br>So whether the answer is good or bad. As long as the answer is real. It is still good science.\r<br>\r<br>And that was what was so tragic about the LHC. All the resources that were put in to that project. Simply could not allow for a real result to be published. Purely for monetary reasons. And now no science can be trusted.\r<br>\r<br>And all of the laser interferometers seem to be having a very real similar problem. The people working on them are like are we being hacked. Because there is literally no reason this should be working now when it wasn&#39;t working before.\r<br>\r<br>And while it is true they could not detect any kind of malfunction or tampering. It doesn&#39;t mean there wasn&#39;t any. As far as I know there&#39;s still more evidence to support the conclusion that the results are incorrect then evidence to suggest that they are legitimate. So all laser interferometers detections are just as suspect as the higgs.\r<br>\r<br>Do you see the problem here.. I mean I&#39;m pretty sure everyone knows the story of the boy who cried wolf. I understand why they&#39;re doing it. Yes I know that more good science can continue with more good funding. Which could only occur with positive results from the LHC.\r<br>\r<br>But I don&#39;t care. Bad science is bad science. Somehow someone thought you have to go back in order to go forward. But besmerching the good name of science is outside of the scope of acceptability. If real Science is the goal.\r<br>\r<br>But whatever. I&#39;m sure no one will read this or care even if they do. But don&#39;t say I didn&#39;t say anything. I&#39;ve been yelling from the top of the Tower of Babel for the last 25 years now. And all I have is a sore throat.\r<br>\r<br>So good luck to us all.

Modify the theory of gravity to fit observations. It&#39;s an extremely small amount. I got an increase in the rate of acceleration that occurs only to stars and galaxies of about 0.0000002007 in/s. (9.86550000254889 m/s\u00b2. When measuring the motion of stars and galaxies, at large scales over long periods of time this small acceleration grows to a rapid velocity. Take note that with the solar system it is orbiting the barycenter of the galaxy at about 240 km/s. If you multiply the acceleration of about 0.0000002007 in/s in 5 billion years the solar system would have gained an extra 500,000 mi/h. It comes out to be an increase in velocity of about a 1 mi/h increase every 10,000 years. The exact amount is required to explain the amount of missing mass to cause the solar system to be traveling 239.6 km/s. General relativity is able to explain about 40,000 mi/h according to the amount of mass the galaxy contains to the inverse squared distance the solar system is to the center of the galaxy. Just by adding a slow acceleration occurring to the motion of stars on top of the motion produced by gravity explains everything. Which translates to about 536,000 mi/h (862,608 km/h). A 1 mi/h increase in velocity every 10,000 years. <br>It even applies to the motion of the Milky Way galaxy and all the other galaxies in our local group of galaxies. <br>The Milky Way is said to be traveling about 1.37 million miles per hour (2,204,801 km/h) towards what called the Great Attractor. That comes out to be a 1 mile per hour increase in velocity every 10,000 years too. The Milky Way is 13.7 billion years old, divide by 1.37 million mi/h and you get a slow acceleration of 1 mile (1.61 km) increase every 10,000 years.<br>If it was missing mass causing the motion of the stars and the galaxy and the rapid motion of the Milky Way then why does the extra motion occurring the sun, which has about 0.037% of the mass of the Milky Way have the same exact slow acceleration as the Milky Way? The common factor in the unexplained motion occurring to the solar system and the Milky Way is time, not mass.  Their mass is not common.

Bad science at worst.  They theorize that there&#39;s a particle with mass and gravity that occupies 5x the mass of the universe but cannot be detected in any other way.   I&#39;m thinking if such a particle existed they would have been hoovered up by the sun just like all that hydrogen that created the sun and the planets in the first place.  The sun would have attracted them and there would be a massive amount of them in the core of the sun.  And if they do in fact create a stronger pull then that would have been observable in the orbits of the planets in our solar system.  Far more likely is that we simple don&#39;t fully understand the model of the universe, that there are other factors we haven&#39;t considered.  Additionally we&#39;ve been searching for years, at great expense, and have nothing to show for it.  At what point do we admit that Dark Matter is not real.   Or is the point of Dark matter to keep our scientific community funded and occupied using a pretext.  I hope its the later as the former would indicate humans are getting more stupid.   Do we add Dark matter to the list of expensive theories we&#39;ve pursued without avail, like string theory. I would also add the search for the Higgs Boson to that list.  Billions spent and decades wasted and then just as the Peter Higgs is weeks away from retiring a &quot;discovery&quot; is made and the Higgs Boson is declared as found.  A rather controversial and much criticized discovery at that. Does that not seem suspicious to anyone else?  My point being is that we can&#39;t always trust the announcements of these research labs.

So I can imagine you can identify. The irony is that the thing in your mind that allows you to entertain bad science. Is also the thing that allows you to recognize extraordinary science. What you have demonstrated on multiple occasions. But that no one seems to have noticed. Because they seem like they&#39;re just a normal video. But what you&#39;re demonstrating are the literal secrets of the universe. And I think they don&#39;t know. Because you don&#39;t actually know. You just know it as a common effect. Not why it&#39;s actually happening.<br><br>The thing is. I think your subconscious does pick that up. Because the way you&#39;re interested in an narrowly mundane feature of the universe. Without exactly knowing why. Tells me your subconscious is at least aware of it.<br><br>Which means you have at some point come to the correct realization and dismissed it. Which is truly unfortunate. Because your voice is so much louder than most.<br><br>Now you might think well. I&#39;m just some crazy person. And to be honest I&#39;m not sure. You might be right. But if there was only one sane person in a crazy world. How many people would it take to screw in a lightbulb..<br><br>But to be honest. I&#39;m not hating on this bad science. Like the fact that it is bad science. Yes of course. But it has the opportunity to be good and real science. But as you can see. The LHC scrood the pooch on that one. Giving all further science discoveries a total bad name. Now how can any scientific discoveries be trusted. Or thought of as legit.<br><br>And now the same thing will happen to any high-profile scientific experiment. And are nowgoing to have the same problem. Where no one will believe them. Is this real science.? Or is this some s*** people are saying to justify the cost.!<br><br>But that&#39;s not even the real problem.!<br><br>The real problem is now stupid people will think that there is an actual higgs particle. Which is utilized as a force carrier. \ud83d\ude02<br><br>I mean. Make up whatever we want I gess. Lol<br><br>That&#39;s going to be a real problem when it comes time for the higgs particle or mechanism to be utilized.<br><br>And I&#39;m sure that&#39;s something they thought of before thinking to pretend they found something. But I&#39;m sure they were like. &quot;Well it&#39;ll probably be like a couple hundred years before the technology comes around to prove that we are totally LYING are f*<b>***</b> asses off.&quot;<br><br>So I&#39;m sure they feel safe. But if &quot;they&quot; (whoever &quot;they&quot; are.) Knew what I know. I guarantee they would have come up with a different lie.<br><br>But it&#39;s already too late. They can&#39;t unbake that cake. And now we are stuck with bad science. Thanks LHC.!!!!<br><br>I mean eventually when we get orbit sized colliders. With some real mind-boggling energy levels. The truth will finally be revealed. <br><br>But damn to wait hundreds of years to be vindicated. Well I guess I&#39;m in good company.<br><br>I just keep thinking about the dark ages. How much further could we be ahead. If humanity hadn&#39;t been held back or set back so many times in human history.<br><br>And here we are still making the same mistakes. Dude if I have to wait a couple hundred years. That&#39;s going to f*<b>***</b> suck.<br><br>Come on guys it&#39;s really pretty simple. I given you All the answers..<br><br>Just be aware that whatever this thing detect&#39;s. If it detects anything at all. It&#39;s not dark matter.!!!<br><br>I mean for one thing. If you were trying to detect dark matter where do you think you would put it. You think underground would be the best place.? Lol obviously if you were answer is yes. Then you&#39;re not using your brain.<br><br>That&#39;s what I&#39;m saying. All the answers are here. You just have to figure them out. I mean I&#39;m not going to tell you the answer is 4. But if you know the facts are 2+2. I think you should be able to pick the ball up and run right.?<br><br>Let&#39;s just take what we know about dark matter for a moment.. it interacts with other matter through gravity. With just that fact alone. Where would you imagine the most gravity to exist near earth is.<br><br>My first thought would be the sun. My second thought would be jupiter. My third thought would be earth itself.<br><br>Now obviously as far as I&#39;m aware. We haven&#39;t sent any detectors to either of those two locations. So Earth is the only acceptable option.<br><br>Which means that if you were going to put a dark matter detector on Earth. Where&#39;s the place you might want to go to detect the most dark matter.<br><br>Would it be in the center of the planet. Would it be just underground. Would it be on the surface of the planet. Or would it be in orbit.?<br><br>Lol got ya that&#39;s a trick question.<br><br>Obviously we&#39;ve already deduced that we&#39;re trying to put this on the planet. However dark matter will accumulate at point of highest gravitational influence. And that is at the l1 LaGrange point. Which contains a large fraction of the gravity well from both planetary bodies. The earth and the moon.<br><br>But as I said earlier it&#39;s only going to be on the earth. So. What is the highest gravitational influence location on the planet Earth. I would go ahead and speculate it is the very top of Mount everest.<br><br>It could be somewhere else. But that actually seems unlikely. Simply due to the fact that Mount Everest is one of the heaviest objects floating on the planet size ocean of magma. Which means there is even more mass of Rock that you are not seeing. Support the height that Mount Everest reaches. As an iceberg. The bigger or higher an iceberg is out of the water. The bigger it is under the water.<br><br>For the same reason. You can think of Mount Everest as being that largest iceberg. Containing more mass. Which would then generate more gravity.<br><br>Number one. The most gravity on the planet Earth is on the surface of the planet. And nowhere else. Not underground. Not up in the atmosphere. Right at the surface of the planet. #2. If you&#39;re going to try to detect a dark matter on the surface of the planet you should go where there is the most gravity. Which should be at Mount everest.<br><br>So as soon as they were talking about placing the detector anywhere but where I&#39;ve just described. They were already wrong.<br><br>But they&#39;re still not going to detect anything because what they&#39;re looking for is incorrect. And does not actually exist. And I&#39;m not talking about virtual particle type existence. Where they might as well not exist. It&#39;s a figment of their imagination. And does not actually exist at all in any time or point in reality. Except for in their own imagination.<br><br>And yes I see the irony in that statement. But I assure you dark matter does exist. But it is mostly not in the place you are looking. And you&#39;re looking for the wrong thing.<br><br>And see right there that&#39;s real good science. Even if the result was negative and they found nothing at all. At which point. They then they gained information. And that is the existence of science. That is its whole purpose and reason of science being a concept in the humanities zeitgeist. It is just a mechanism designed to answer questions about existence. And that&#39;s really all Science is. &quot;The pursuit Of Truth&quot;<br><br>So whether the answer is good or bad. As long as the answer is real. It is still good science.<br><br>And that was what was so tragic about the LHC. All the resources that were put in to that project. Simply could not allow for a real result to be published. Purely for monetary reasons. And now no science can be trusted.<br><br>And all of the laser interferometers seem to be having a very real similar problem. The people working on them are like are we being hacked. Because there is literally no reason this should be working now when it wasn&#39;t working before.<br><br>And while it is true they could not detect any kind of malfunction or tampering. It doesn&#39;t mean there wasn&#39;t any. As far as I know there&#39;s still more evidence to support the conclusion that the results are incorrect then evidence to suggest that they are legitimate. So all laser interferometers detections are just as suspect as the higgs.<br><br>Do you see the problem here.. I mean I&#39;m pretty sure everyone knows the story of the boy who cried wolf. I understand why they&#39;re doing it. Yes I know that more good science can continue with more good funding. Which could only occur with positive results from the LHC.<br><br>But I don&#39;t care. Bad science is bad science. Somehow someone thought you have to go back in order to go forward. But besmerching the good name of science is outside of the scope of acceptability. If real Science is the goal.<br><br>But whatever. I&#39;m sure no one will read this or care even if they do. But don&#39;t say I didn&#39;t say anything. I&#39;ve been yelling from the top of the Tower of Babel for the last 25 years now. And all I have is a sore throat.<br><br>So good luck to us all.

There&#39;s a simple concept that&#39;s been overlooked, I call it electromagnetic star migration. It is based on the idea that a big factor in a star&#39;s migration is its own emissions within its environment. If its emissions back up (producing a sort of pressure) in one direction, then it will migrate in the other direction where its emissions more freely escape. This could also partially explain how different galaxies form, which could be based on an area of space where stars either emit more or less freely. From our limited perspective in time and space, and our inability to detect these kinds of directional pressure from emissions, it would be impossible to detect. <br><br>But there was a more recent scientific event that gives some credence to the theory. It was the faux headlines saying &quot;a parallel universe was detected&quot; by ANITA when radio waves were found moving in the opposite direction of Earth&#39;s magnetic field. A more obvious explanation, to me, was that the rate at which the particle waves were flowing caused a traffic jam and forced some backward without changing the particles&#39; polarization. This would show at least that the rate of flow can create a sort of force.<br><br>Regarding the gravitation lensing observed in the absence of matter (considered to be proof of dark matter), I also think would be explained by the ability of electromagnetism to produce a lensing effect. It&#39;s known this can occur, but the question not explored is if an enormous amount of these microscopic lensing effects from unseeable tiny charged particles across a vast distance could produce the massive lensing we&#39;re seeing.", "comment_date": "2022-06-02T22:50:42Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Dunkitay", "comment_text": "ive talked to some professors in the field and they say hopefully we will be able to have a signal sometime this or next year with the SABRE experiment!", "comment_date": "2022-06-02T22:49:28Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "HobbesJunior", "comment_text": "except with the rotation speed demoed on earth, a light object is being pulled down, not inwards, by gravity, ... this drastically reduces amount of g force needed, for the pulldown (pull in), effect. ,,, a heavy object has more rotational (g force) energy, compared to the center point, which is not in the center, but now down 60 degress, so the pull inwards is (5? times) less? ,,,", "comment_date": "2022-06-02T22:49:11Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Hugh Mungus Bungus Fungus", "comment_text": "How do we know that dark matter isn&#39;t just normal matter that&#39;s too cold for us to see?", "comment_date": "2022-06-02T22:49:06Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Jesse Anderson", "comment_text": "Everyone has heard of dark matter, but this is the first I&#39;d heard about it that clearly explained what it actually might be.

In truth it varies with the sidereal day. It is caused by the rising and falling of the x-ray sources in the Milky Way visible to the Earths surface where the detector resides. <br><br>There are a huge number of parameters that vary on an annual cycle. You mentioned a few. There are countless more. I suspect that the chances are high that the Australian experiment will show results 180 degrees out of phase with the Italian results - or - no phase variance at all.

Largely these ideas were driven in the 1970s by the problem that the rotational velocities of galaxies did not match Keplerian based expectations. This is from both the flat radial velocities curves at large sizes relative to the galactic diameter (which you described), and the far more complex problem of the mismatch between Keplerian expectations and observed reality at the smaller scale of the radial velocity curves for distances less that the observed radius of visible stars in galaxies. <br><br>At the small radial distances the curves for Andromeda and the Milky Way show a fast core with a roughly linear increase in velocity with distance to the size of the galactic core. Beyond that lies a messy zone we\u2019re radial velocity reverses. Outside that radial velocities rapidly increase then change to roughly a linear velocity increase with distance out to the visible radial size of the galaxy. From that point outward the radial velocity remains constant. <br><br>The curves look like a fast rotating solid central section surrounded by a messy reverse velocity zone, that then transitions to an outer zone that rotates like a flat solid plate - except that the inner portion is moving too fast - like Keplerian expectations added to the disk like behavior. <br><br>This is not at all what was expected. And trying to force Keplerian expectations on the measured radial velocity curves largely generated the need for dark matter AND dark energy. Nebulae and other observations added to this. This ad hoc approach absolutely is not science. Yet it happened. <br><br>What is really at work?  That remains unknown. It almost certainly is not dark matter or dark energy or some unknown fifth force. <br><br>MOND provides a much simpler - a vastly simpler - explanation. It does not however have an underlying theoretical foundation. But then neither does Cold Dark Matter (CDM) and Dark Energy. <br><br>More recent ideas perhaps explain everything. <br><br>Consider that gravity isn\u2019t a force - that in point of fact, gravity doesn\u2019t exist at all. <br><br>Consider that what we call gravity is an artifact of the distortion of space-time by mass. And that mass isn\u2019t what we imagine either. But for the moment, consider that mass distorts the shape of space-time. Now apply Newtonian motion (at low speeds), and Einsteinian motion at high speeds. The motions remain linear as seen in the distorted space-time. Undistort that to Euclidean space and the motions are complex curves. <br><br>Similatly, in distorted space-time the velocities remain constant with motion - barring interactions. Undistort and the motions are anything but linear. Conservation of angular momentum and various moments of inertia; both for object rotations, and for object rotation \u2018around\u2019 a center of mass add to this complexity. So too nay electromagnetic conservations and interactions. <br><br>These still don\u2019t match observations. Well, not until we add in the expansion of the Universe. Imagine that in Euclidean view as a stretching in all directions. It is more complex than that however as it is a linear change in dimensional size in space-time with time. This is not insignificant at the scale of galaxies and beyond. It is insignificant, I.e. non-observable, at the scale of solar systems. <br><br>Now put these all together. Everything fits. <br><br>Well, except for that high radial velocity zone in the core of Andromeda and the Milky Way, and likely by extension to all galaxies. What causes that? Why is it distinctly different from the rest of the galaxy?  Who knows? That is the realm for new theories and new science. <br><br>For now our problem is in getting the old wrong ideas like CDM and Dark Energy to die. If the history of science tells us anything, it is that the time frame for that is the lifetime of the researchers believing these wrong ideas. Only when most of them have grown old and die will the more correct (though often still wrong ideas) prevail. This is the inertia of resistance to discovery. <br><br>And given the rate of change of catastrophic climate change, we may well not make it to a truer understanding before the collapse of civilization occurs and perhaps even the end of man as Earth shifts rapidly to an equable climate regime where agriculture as we have known it is impossible. That is unfortunate, as we are I believe on the cusp of a fundamental shift in science.

I don&#39;t think dark matter exists. To understand this you need to understand how gravity is created. The answer lies in the fact that at the quantum level, the speed of quantum particles is faster than light, resulting in partial equalization in several places. This also means that on the one hand speed in space can form an anti-force, a simplified explanation would be a gravitational vacuum due to speed / time / movement / =&gt; subspace =&gt; space-time =&gt; gravity, a new dimension on the self. Gravity is not considered a force in science, but here lies the flaw. it&#39;s a negative force/or some kind of vacuum force. In concrete terms, this means that you generally have to view matter in a different way adapted to sublevels. So there is a direct relationship between the subatomic and attraction.

If that is the case, I wonder if there would be a way to set up the crystal structure in such a way that from a single direction it would actually be impossible to get through without hitting some nucleus... it would probably be impossible seeing as how much empty space there is in an atom... perhaps there is an atom with a larger nucleus that would increase the chances of interaction?", "comment_date": "2022-06-02T15:24:29Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Davit.G Dukart.M", "comment_text": "The way of thinking of science has to be changed, it can be measured, yes, of course, but it is time to interact, we need a type of meter but in the form of a signal that travels and returns in that same signal if we want to find something, we must interact with the environment that surrounds us, we have to stop seeing only numbers.

In fact there&#39;s a vast amount of evidence that it is ordinary matter. Also the claim that there&#39;s a spherical halo doesn&#39;t match the rotation curve. Consequences that can be calculated from the theory that it&#39;s ordinary mater match observations over a broad range of consequences. The shapes of galaxies can be calculated from the rotation curve. That consequence matches all galaxies from spherical to disk shaped. Simply put a steep rotation curve calculates to a sphere, a flat curve is a well populated disk, a Keplerian curve matches all in the center, and little in the disk of the ecliptic. Since the rotation curve describes a disk for disk galaxies then it is normal interacting matter. Our own solar system has more matter than the estimate average of distribution density that can be calculated from the &quot;missing&quot; matter. That is a density of about 400 Jupiter size planets in the space between Sol, and Alpha Centauri. If it was a more or less uniform distribution of Jupiter size planets we would calculate the nearest to be on average 3 light months away. We wouldn&#39;t see it. But we do see Jupiter size planets in our own solar system We have a higher than average number nearby. That matches the theory as ordinary matter. Far from mass concentrations mass moves more slowly than near concentrations like stars, and therefore accretion is slower between the stars. We wouldn&#39;t get star accretion out there as fast as near star mass concentrations accretion into stars. The visible halos around galaxies are illusions same as they are on earth. It is suggested that if the halos were caused the sam as on earth like a street light on a foggy night there should be increasing halo density with distance. That assumes the &quot;fog&quot; is uniform between galaxies. But it isn&#39;t It is in threads as part of the threads that galaxies structure into at large scales. When seeing into a thread to a galactic halo from the side of a thread there is no increase with distance. But in those rare instances where a thread is aligned with our line of sight there is an increase over that distance. I strongly suspect the dark matter theory isn&#39;t out of ignorance because it can be disposed of so easily, and broadly. But is a dishonest technobabble swindle for funding. That is my theory of what dark matter is. The rotation curve is ordinary matter.

Einstein explained it in the 1939 journal &quot;Annals of mathematics&quot;. Wherever you have an astronomical quantity of mass &quot;dilation&quot; (sometimes called gamma or y) will occur. Mass that is dilated is smeared through spacetime relative to an outside observer. If you look at a common relativity graph, with velocity on the horizontal line and dilation on the vertical, the phenomenon is clear, even mass that exists at 75% light speed is partially dilated.<br>  There is no place in the universe where mass is more concentrated than at the center of a galaxy. 99.8% of the mass in our solar system is in the sun. 99.9% of the mass in an atom is in the nucleus. If these norms are true for galaxies than we can infer that there is 100&#39;s of trillions of solar masses at the center of common spiral galaxies. There is no way to know through observation, there is far too much interference, dilation and gravitational lensing. High mass means high momentum. If we attribute a radius to these numbers than we can calculate that relativistic velocities exist in these regions.<br>   The mass at the center of our own galaxy is dilated, in some sublime way that mass is all around us because as the graph shows we are still connected to it. The recent discovery that low mass galaxies (like NGC 1052-DF2) have normal star rotation rates is confirmation that dilation is the governing phenomenon at galactic centers. This is what relativity would predict because there is an insufficient quantity of mass to achieve relativistic velocities.<br>   The fact that mass will dilate when it approaches the speed of light is something we all learned in high school at it perfectly explains the greatest mystery in science. There is no &quot;mystery&quot; mass, there is just mass at differing degrees of dilation.", "comment_date": "2022-06-02T14:44:01Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Ole Dicks", "comment_text": "These videos make me lowkey wanna study astrophysics", "comment_date": "2022-06-02T14:43:57Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Jim Seagoe", "comment_text": "It&#39;s phlogiston!", "comment_date": "2022-06-02T14:43:48Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Shake'N'Bake", "comment_text": "So dark matter is kinda like invisible space goop holding stuff together?", "comment_date": "2022-06-02T14:43:36Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Julia Red", "comment_text": "hmm, I was expecting them to show a neutrino detector in that cave? wasn&#39;t neutrino once thought as dark matter candidate? oh or maybe in this experiment the neutrinos wouldn&#39;t affect anything there?", "comment_date": "2022-06-02T14:43:28Z", "likes_count": 107}, {"comment_by": "XtROLLINGSTONES BBomber", "comment_text": "Damn and i thought that the alps were in the north", "comment_date": "2022-06-02T14:43:20Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Yes But You Then", "comment_text": "Insane!", "comment_date": "2022-06-02T14:43:14Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "T J", "comment_text": "The universe is electromagnetic.

Magnetic fields cycling patterns of thermodynamics in quantum gravitational fields of forced cycling patterns holding mass together. Resistance is in all mass repelling outward pressure as weight. Occupied space is the weakest point of resistance. Mass travels to the weakest point of resistance repelled by cold resistance of space. Two forces combine to make mass in entanglement. Gravitational fields of forced motion hold mass together cycling in equalization. If gravitational fields break down because of increasing Thermodynamics then masses gravitational fields increase or blow out like a fuse or light bulb. Thermodynamics is the variant.

There is no universal coordinate system. Each system is connected to neighbour systems like the phase boundaries in a superfluid. We see the effect of swirls existing around subsystems that has a near uniform rotation and speed relative to our system, and with their own emergent general relativity - due to their locally emerged uniform coordinate systems, held together (made rigid) by existance of the local interactions there.<br>2. There are four orthogonal equally probable &quot;time&quot; directions for any 4D structure that has a quantized translational invariance. Since we are built from such particles, we have one of them. But there are three others that cannot interact with us except through gravity if general relativity is perfectly uniform. <br><br>If we measure exactly 25% &quot;real matter&quot;, it follows then that there can be only one universal general relativity. But we don&#39;t. So there must be a dispersion of subsystems with different GR rotation and speed relative to us, and/or each system is not perfectly rigid so the four &quot;time&quot; directions in each system are not perfectly orthogonal everywhere and on all scales that matter for a particle. <br><br>Since we see both dark matter and dark energy as almost independent phenomena, the correct word is not or but and on the and/or above. They are about two almost independent dispersion phenomena.

It used to be that the point of science was to make dispassionate observations, from which we could draw very limited conclusions, and eventually more general theories. But now we take our existing theories as the starting point, and the role of the scientist is to find observations that confirm the theories. If the observations stubbornly refuse to confirm the theories, then, instead of taking this as evidence of weaknesses in the theories, we instead take it as evidence of the existence of random stuff that we can&#39;t detect.<br><br>If we were talking minor discrepancies, then reasoning along these lines might be justifiable, kind of how they discovered Pluto by observing discrepancies in Neptune&#39;s orbit. (But I may have the planets wrong here). But if you need to say that 85% of the matter in the universe is undetectable in order to make your theories work, I think it is far more likely that your theory is just plain wrong.

Like there could be the layer we know, then a large scale layer that&#39;s on the scale of entire galaxies and nebula&#39;s and other complex and diverse grand massive objects that have all sorts of behaviors interacting with in each other that I&#39;m sure needs to be factored in to get this layer of grand scale gravity correctly. Then there could be sub atomic gravity or micro gravity or atomic gravity layer. That can essentially be the strong force and the weak force but it&#39;s just a different version of gravity on the smallest scale. So right now I&#39;m just theorizing 3 layers of gravity, as an improved concept of the nature of gravity withing the natural world. The smaller layer, the normal layer we have understood very well that relates to our solar system type scale. Then there is the 3rd layer, the massive layer. Dealing with things that are light years across, vast temperature differences, density&#39;s, velocity&#39;s and diversity. Intense pressures, electro static charges, electromagnetism, plasma clouds, black holes, pulsar, quasars, neutron star&#39;s, super Nova explosions, gas clouds, solar winds, radiation, tons of interwoven orbital interactions and angular momentum velocities, multiple galaxies interacting upon other galaxies. Just so many things that probably all have to be accounted for when we are dealing with scales with such vast massive intracity, and scales as vast layers of complexity that the 3rd layer of gravity hypothetically could be covering? This is just a gut feeling, and I&#39;m just doing a thought experiment with and I&#39;d love it if someone else wants to improve onto it.
