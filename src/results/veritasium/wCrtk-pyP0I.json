But one thing was wrong, that the amplification of the waves varies with the electromagnetic absorption extent. This absorption extent depends on the bulk of the substance and not the surface area, as the internal as well as external absorption happens within the grape. Also, there is a continuous absorption and deflection of the microwaves within the grape, which does not allow the waves to escape out, somewhat similar to an optical medium in which light gets trapped as a result of total internal reflection. That&#39;s why the amplification, and therefore the concentration of the electromagnetic waves is maximum at the centre of the grape, and hence the two fields of electromagnetism interact with each other because of ionisation of periarieal air.<br>Credit - Satvik Lahiry Bhattacharya", "comment_date": "2022-05-04T02:43:14Z", "likes_count": 12}, {"comment_by": "Paul Balogh", "comment_text": "Take microwave outside, fill with light bulbs\u2026.. 10 minutes, great party starter\u2026.", "comment_date": "2022-05-04T01:38:42Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Paul Balogh", "comment_text": "Use microwave outside\u2026.", "comment_date": "2022-05-04T01:36:06Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Cruger Gallaudet", "comment_text": "I like the product placement of Cheerios.

For many will come in my name, saying, \u2018I am the Christ,\u2019 and they will lead many astray. And you will hear of wars and rumors of wars. See that you are not alarmed, for this must take place, but the end is not yet. For nation will rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom, and there will be famines and earthquakes in various places. All these are but the beginning of the birth pains. \u201cThen they will deliver you up to tribulation and put you to death, and you will be hated by all nations for my name\u2019s sake. And then many will fall away and betray one another and hate one another. And many false prophets will arise and lead many astray. And because lawlessness will be increased, the love of many will grow cold. But the one who endures to the end will be saved. And this gospel of the kingdom will be proclaimed throughout the whole world as a testimony to all nations, and then the end will come.</i></b> <br><br><b><i>\u201cSo when you see the abomination of desolation spoken of by the prophet Daniel, standing in the holy place ( let the reader understand), then let those who are in Judea flee to the mountains. Let the one who is on the housetop not go down to take what is in his house, and let the one who is in the field not turn back to take his cloak. And alas for women who are pregnant and for those who are nursing infants in those days! Pray that your flight may not be in winter or on a Sabbath. For then there will be great tribulation, such as has not been from the beginning of the world until now, no, and never will be. And if those days had not been cut short, no human being would be saved. But for the sake of the elect those days will be cut short. Then if anyone says to you, \u2018Look, here is the Christ!\u2019 or \u2018There he is!\u2019 do not believe it. For false christs and false prophets will arise and perform great signs and wonders, so as to lead astray, if possible, even the elect. See, I have told you beforehand. So, if they say to you, \u2018Look, he is in the wilderness,\u2019 do not go out. If they say, \u2018Look, he is in the inner rooms,\u2019 do not believe it. For as the lightning comes from the east and shines as far as the west, so will be the coming of the Son of Man. Wherever the corpse is, there the vultures will gather.</i></b> <br><br><b><i>\u201cImmediately after the tribulation of those days the sun will be darkened, and the moon will not give its light, and the stars will fall from heaven, and the powers of the heavens will be shaken. Then will appear in heaven the sign of the Son of Man, and then all the tribes of the earth will mourn, and they will see the Son of Man coming on the clouds of heaven with power and great glory. And he will send out his angels with a loud trumpet call, and they will gather his elect from the four winds, from one end of heaven to the other.</i></b> <br><br><b><i>\u201cFrom the fig tree learn its lesson: as soon as its branch becomes tender and puts out its leaves, you know that summer is near. So also, when you see all these things, you know that he is near, at the very gates. Truly, I say to you, this generation will not pass away until all these things take place. Heaven and earth will pass away, but my words will not pass away.</i></b> <br><br><b><i>\u201cBut concerning that day and hour no one knows, not even the angels of heaven, nor the Son, but the Father only. For as were the days of Noah, so will be the coming of the Son of Man. For as in those days before the flood they were eating and drinking, marrying and giving in marriage, until the day when Noah entered the ark, and they were unaware until the flood came and swept them all away, so will be the coming of the Son of Man. Then two men will be in the field; one will be taken and one left. Two women will be grinding at the mill; one will be taken and one left. Therefore, stay awake, for you do not know on what day your Lord is coming. But know this, that if the master of the house had known in what part of the night the thief was coming, he would have stayed awake and would not have let his house be broken into. Therefore you also must be ready, for the Son of Man is coming at an hour you do not expect. \u201cWho then is the faithful and wise servant, whom his master has set over his household, to give them their food at the proper time? Blessed is that servant whom his master will find so doing when he comes. Truly, I say to you, he will set him over all his possessions. But if that wicked servant says to himself, \u2018My master is delayed,\u2019 and begins to beat his fellow servants and eats and drinks with drunkards, the master of that servant will come on a day when he does not expect him and at an hour he does not know and will cut him in pieces and put him with the hypocrites. In that place there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth.</i></b>\r<br><i>Matthew 24:3-\u202c51</i><br><br><br><b><i>\u201cFor God so loved the world, that he gave his only Son, that whoever believes in him should not perish but have eternal life. For God did not send his Son into the world to condemn the world, but in order that the world might be saved through him. Whoever believes in him is not condemned, but whoever does not believe is condemned already, because he has not believed in the name of the only Son of God. And this is the judgment: the light has come into the world, and people loved the darkness rather than the light because their works were evil. For everyone who does wicked things hates the light and does not come to the light, lest his works should be exposed. But whoever does what is true comes to the light, so that it may be clearly seen that his works have been carried out in God.\u201d</i></b><br><i>John 3:16\u202d-\u202c21</i><br><br>He, the First Born, the Alpha and the Omega, the Word, the Verb from the beginning of time, the Son of man, the Lamb, the Lord of lords, the King of kings, the only begotten Son of <b><i>I Am,</i></b> the Savior, the Messiah, the Christ, is Jesus of Nazareth! <br>All glory and honor and thanksgiving and love and praise to the Most High, the Holy One, for He created all things, and by His will they existed and were created.

Its called &quot;watergen&quot;. I wonder why this isnt everywhere. Guess cuz its harder to rip off people like when they buy water and pay the water bill.<br><br>I wonder if this cheapo plasma generator could be improved to harvest its energy and save it to a battery or sth.

I am the co-author of two peer-reviewed papers on the 4th state of water (i.e. TOSH) with an electro-chemist, Klaus Oehr. While I understand why the explanation offered herein is an intuitively appealing one, it may not be the one and only explanation of this phenomenon. Without reading the paper cited yet, here is my early take: Microwaving grapes do not &quot;create plasma&quot; as such. What microwaves do is release the plasma (i.e. photons) that is/are already present and stored in various molecules within, which absorbed during the photosynthesis process as virtual electrons. One could say they excite the z-axis pi-electrons in ring molecules so as to re-release those photons that were absorbed through photosynthesis during the growing process. All living beings that have contact with the sun&#39;s light or that inhale/repirate photon rich oxygen and nitrogen from the atmosphere would do no less. However, the focusing aspect of the microwave proposition is likely correct.

The skin on the grape acts as an isulator. When the microwaves travel across the grapes a voltage is generated to a level where the &quot;insulation&quot; breaks down causing an arc flash.

The arc temperature should be 35k f or 4 times hotter than the sun but this only last for a few ms as the arc is initiated before separation of the grapes.

I have seen other video where a guy claimed that 2 frequencies focused on a sample would kill only the cancer cells and not the normal cells!  I wish the medical community wll have better luck in the future to help others survive the damages that tumors do to them but also to survive the treatments that I can say I could feel the energy that was being focused at my tumors!  Each treatment would seem painless for the first 8 - 12 hours after exposure, but then the next 2-3 days I just had to endure the pain or sleep those days away!  We really need to find better ways to treat people that do not use radiation which DOES kill healthy cells and the cancerous ones....  Might as well just bore a hole to a tumor and scoop it out of a person and force the body to regenerate all the muscle,  skin, blood, that had to be removed from the bore hole to get to the tumor!   Just think about the amount of dudes that play stupid video games for hours and hours!!!  that time they spent wasting their youth cold have been better spent educating themselves and then helping others in the real world!  I have little hope of surviving any longer than another year, but if I could have furthered medical research by giving my waited youth time spent playing stupid video games!   Or if i am able to survive this cancer &quot;infection&quot; I would like to be able to become a lawyer and be the change that I am very disappointed that those &quot; agents in the  / employees of the state &quot;  justice system have seemed to have forgotten /  lost / never learned what the purpose the justice system should be able to exist for....

Change in impedance is often expressed at higher frequencies as index of refraction, but in lower frequencies its epsilon relative (change in electric permitivity). This is because at higher frequencies the area that is effected by diffraction is much smaller, and thus its simplified to index of refraction. If you applied the same maxwell&#39;s equations to higher frequencies you&#39;d get the same results as doing the math with index of refraction, its just a lot more work. <br><br>Thus that&#39;s why the grape acts like an internal reflector. The change in impedance causes the reflection coefficient to be so large that much of the energy is reflected back inside the grape rather than transmitted back into the air. <br><br>The same thing happens with a mirror, it has a massive reflection coefficient, across a decent range of frequencies (something not easy to always do). And this is how you create materials that are non reflective, you design the material to have a very small reflection coefficient. Doing that over broad frequencies often requires multiple layers of materials as well as trying to deal with angle of incidents, which also changes the effective impedance because the path length in the material changes. Then throw in the polarization of the waves and things get even funner. <br><br>Welcome to masters level or higher electrical engineering.", "comment_date": "2019-09-27T21:04:12Z", "likes_count": 3}, {"comment_by": "Sarah Wardley", "comment_text": "Eats the grapes to gain super human abilities.", "comment_date": "2019-09-27T16:40:47Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "hi there", "comment_text": "no one<br><br>not even a single soul<br><br><br>grapes in the thumbnail:*Godly* <b>Balls</b>", "comment_date": "2019-09-27T14:27:59Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "\ud558\ub098", "comment_text": "This is fireegg", "comment_date": "2019-09-27T08:54:11Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "NoWits", "comment_text": "Can we make a gun with this?", "comment_date": "2019-09-26T22:14:51Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "DesingitTime", "comment_text": "I kinda wanna try this at home, BUT I have a question.

Second pro tip, correct wattage information for recipes, for most micowaves the wattage shown on the sticker inside the microwave just shows the &quot;input&quot; wattage of the microwave (but you might be lucky and have a sticker that says input and output). Usually this sticker will say 1500 watts or 1.5 kw or close too that. This is NOT your microwave wattage for use in recipes. This is just the amount of electricity your micowave draws from the power outlet, what you want for your food recipes is the output wattage. This can be harder to find in some cases especially if you don&#39;t have the owners manual of your microwave. An easy way to find this is to find the model number of your microwave (usually on one of the stickers on or inside your microwave) and google that model number and the word &quot;specs&quot;. Then click one of the first links and it should tell you what your correct microwave wattage is. You may be shocked at what your actual wattage is, my microwave sticker says 1.5 kw (1500 watts) and the website showed the spec sheet for my microwave and it shows it as a 950 watt microwave. Now once you have the correct wattage of your microwave you want to lookup a conversion chart for microwave times so say if your hot pocket says the cook time is for 1100 watt microwaves and you have a 950 watt one like me then you can adjust the cook time correctly. <a href=\"https://www.microwavecookingforone.com/Charts/\">https://www.microwavecookingforone.com/Charts/</a>", "comment_date": "2019-05-09T16:30:45Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Timothy Sullivan", "comment_text": "<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCrtk-pyP0I&amp;t=3m20s\">3:20</a><br>\u201cIt never occurred to me to think of space as the thing that\u2019s moving\u201d<br><br><br>Like if you understand.", "comment_date": "2019-05-09T03:17:29Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Chris Ilias", "comment_text": "I&#39;m so jealous of you..", "comment_date": "2019-05-09T01:59:45Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "I Bill", "comment_text": "Great video to make you sleep!!", "comment_date": "2019-05-08T01:58:35Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "The Mountain", "comment_text": "Wow that is amazing", "comment_date": "2019-05-07T15:47:25Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "rat bastard", "comment_text": "and now Im eating grapes BAY BEE", "comment_date": "2019-05-07T05:10:23Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "MON", "comment_text": "Has anyone inveterate the walk in microwave oven yet", "comment_date": "2019-05-06T23:18:35Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "ThePostal67", "comment_text": "GAD!\u00a0 Looked at one and did not like a narcissist telling me something that\u00a0 I WANT TO WATCH", "comment_date": "2019-05-06T14:02:25Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "barry mcdougal", "comment_text": "THANK GOD WE KNOW THIS ---- SCIENTISTS CAN NOW RETIRE AS THE BIG QUESTION HAS BEEN ANSWERED.", "comment_date": "2019-05-06T01:08:52Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Slow 6six", "comment_text": "If I microwave the grape will i be able to eat it ?", "comment_date": "2019-05-06T00:57:59Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "I love 5G and the aliens that are coming back.", "comment_text": "This must have something to do with dmt angels and pyramid building, right?", "comment_date": "2019-05-05T22:40:44Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Rainy R&R & R&R", "comment_text": "Plasma isn&#39;t  that blood?", "comment_date": "2019-05-05T20:57:28Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Mofzzy", "comment_text": "Microwaves heat\u00a0food like the sun heats your face\u2014by radiation.

It was daylight on a summer afternoon, when a large storm front was approaching.  There was no rain yet.  I was standing in an adjacent parking lot talking to some friends and suddenly a shower of sparks came off nearby (like 70 foot) power lines.   A plasma ball (about the size of a beach ball) floated slowly across the street from left to right and over a parked vehicle in my driveway.  I walked up to that driveway and back to my house with one friend and another ball came right behind us.  It dissipated in a bright flash, maybe 12 feet from where we were standing.  The other folks still at the parking lot all saw it but were ignorant of its rarity and significance so didn&#39;t yank out their cellphones.  One observer guessed the diameter of the second ball around 5 feet right  before it died.

Wow it&#39;s amazing how people freak out when they see something that they just don&#39;t understand or know anything about. <br>It&#39;s not rocket science, the energy from a microwave is just like any other transmitter it is RF (Radio Frequency) AC (Alternating Current), it just happens to be at a very short way length, that short wavelength is what causes the plasma to sustain once created, with any antenna of 1/4 wavelength the antenna radiates both an electrostatic and and electromagnetic field, the electromagnetic radiation occurs near the feed point of the antenna and is perpendicular to the antenna while the electrostatic radiation is parallel to the antenna and radiated mostly from the top of the antenna furthest from the feed point, this is because near the feed point the current is very high, but as you move toward the top of the antenna, the current is gradually exchanged with voltage or potential, 1/4 wave antennas have a limit as to how much power you can feed them with before the voltage becomes so high that it breaks down the dielectric of air, causing it to become ionized, which means that it is no longer and insulator and it now begins to conduct current this causes it to become superheated to many thousands of degrees Fahrenheit until it starts to emit photons which we see as visible light, that is what we see radiated from the top of a Tesla coil, you notice that in many cases the discharge from a Tesla coil is radiated from a single terminal into the air and does not strike any thing except the air. Tesla coils operate at very low frequency as compared with a microwave, to put it in prospective for you  the AC in a wall  outlet changes its polarity 60 times per second or 60hz, therefore the 1/4 wavelength is about 750 miles, Tesla coils operate at frequencies of between 100 and 500khz or 100,000 to  500,000 times per second, so a 1/4 wavelength at these frequencies is much shorter, usually a few hundred feet, but in the case of the microwave it&#39;s much faster at 2.54Ghz that&#39;s a whopping 2,540,000,000 times per second so the wavelength is much much shorter, well for some reason it did not copy all of, or it did not past all of it, so let&#39;s see if I can copy and paste the rest of it in edit mode.", "comment_date": "2019-03-04T04:18:42Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Richard_ Slavik", "comment_text": "Next thing after this is \u201care grapes the missing link towards creating plasma guns?\u201d I want to see that", "comment_date": "2019-03-04T04:11:15Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "fcknhb", "comment_text": "frickin&#39; nerds.", "comment_date": "2019-03-04T03:47:14Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Brian Kaiser", "comment_text": "I was just waiting to be Rickrolled the whole time :)", "comment_date": "2019-03-04T03:46:20Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Frankatlake", "comment_text": "I wonder what the effect of a spherical, in phase, isochronical, array might be; a sort of a microwave implosion.

The world is a simulation and we\u2019re all essentially the property/characters for beings in a different/higher dimension than us. What we think is our reality is essentially a toy world for another civilization. We\u2019re all controlled via what I call a Sensory Manipulation Cloud (SMC) The symptoms of schizophrenia and dissociative identity disorder THE SAME as consciously experiencing the SMC (something we&#39;re not supposed to be able to do, but can do by thinking through your actions always choosing the best/most moral action, strengthening our 5 senses, being loving, working hard and staying lighthearted). For these reasons (and luck) I\u2019m more conscious or experiencing consciousness on a higher level than the rest of society. I meditate a lot, I don\u2019t smoke weed or do any hallucinogens (I do smoke cigarettes). I&#39;m guessing whatever civilization owns us, the ratio their to our existences is Human to Petri Dish or Human to Animal; meaning they&#39;re viewing us through completely different paradigm, probably like owning property. Schizophrenia and certain mental disorders are a preemptive crippling of people who they know have a higher chance of having high awareness/ being conscious/being aware of the simulation and the peculiarities that reveal we&#39;re in a simulation (Autistic Savants? Highly Empathetic Intelligent people with mental disorders?).<br><br>Schizophrenia<br><br>Delusions. These are false beliefs that are not based in reality. For example, you think that you&#39;re being harmed or harassed; certain gestures or comments are directed at you; you have exceptional ability or fame; another person is in love with you; or a major catastrophe is about to occur. Delusions occur in most people with schizophrenia.<br><br>Hallucinations. These usually involve seeing or hearing things that don&#39;t exist. Yet for the person with schizophrenia, they have the full force and impact of a normal experience. Hallucinations can be in any of the senses, but hearing voices is the most common hallucination.<br><br>Disorganized thinking (speech). Disorganized thinking is inferred from disorganized speech. Effective communication can be impaired, and answers to questions may be partially or completely unrelated. Rarely, speech may include putting together meaningless words that can&#39;t be understood, sometimes known as word salad.<br><br>Extremely disorganized or abnormal motor behavior. This may show in a number of ways, from childlike silliness to unpredictable agitation. Behavior isn&#39;t focused on a goal, so it&#39;s hard to do tasks. Behavior can include resistance to instructions, inappropriate or bizarre posture, a complete lack of response, or useless and excessive movement.<br><br>Negative symptoms. This refers to reduced or lack of ability to function normally. For example, the person may neglect personal hygiene or appear to lack emotion (doesn&#39;t make eye contact, doesn&#39;t change facial expressions or speaks in a monotone). Also, the person may have lose interest in everyday activities, socially withdraw or lack the ability to experience pleasure.<br><br>Schizophrenia/ Dissociative - Delusion Grandeur, Seeing patterns, Highlighted Coincidence, Hearing Voices, Word Salad, Persecution, Inability to Distinguish Internal External Forces.

Manages our personality in two ways, a thicker membrane that\u2019s closer to the face, and I think it thins out into a cloud further away from the body. The membrane on the face manipulates and shapes our face/emotions/lips movements. The outer cloud alters how we perceive the world. The entire cloud is invisible to all of us for some reason but I\u2019ve started becoming aware of mine a few years ago. This cloud is adjusted by degrees smaller than a pin point to affect our perception ( make the world seem bigger, smaller, affect motor skills by toying with our visual perception, can be adjusted to make the world appear scary/moody, beautiful, cinematic/movie like/slower/faster/ more open/ more claustrophobic, make it look like you have four arms, can subtly highlight certain things to make you form certain patterns/superstitious like beliefs like noticing a certain color everywhere suddenly, make a person look bigger than you [a person looks than bigger than you if you admire or are intimidated by them], subtly/suddenly changing your perception mid-thought so you forget suddenly what you&#39;re thinking/brain fart, highlight people or thinking, subtly make the cloud denser in certain places so you don&#39;t focus on an object or information. Pay attention to when you read, you&#39;ll notice you skip over certain words [this is done to control our paradigms, and what we absorb, I&#39;m guessing after a lifetime of being manipulated this way a person&#39;s personality can be guided ]) I\u2019m assuming every human&#39;s SMC cloud is unique like an IP address. The SMC densities can be altered to recreate different sensations, Everyone has emotions and each of those emotions have corresponding feelings . The SMC can be fine tuned over and over to mimic feelings and their corresponding sensations, until we&#39;re controlled in a pavlovian/reward-response/manipulable way. I don&#39;t know why the SMC can&#39;t be detected by the typical eye or even scientific equipment.<br><br>OUR GAMER can show us images in this cloud, usually based on what you&#39;re thinking, so it&#39;s easier for you to accept the images. You can form a conversation/theme/dialogue with someone you think is in your head but your gamer just uses something the mind naturally does . When you think a question or statement, your brain thinks of expected responses . Gamers use a self-perpetuated feedback technique based off this brain function where it seems like you&#39;re talking to someone but the responses are from YOUR GAMER JUST CONTINUALLY LETTING YOU HEAR RESPONSES THAT YOU NATURALLY EXPECT.

Just a minute while I go and scramble my hair to get some credibility before I go on.\r<br> Firstly the refractive index of a material decreases with increasing wave length. An example of this is (blue bends best rule) in a prism dispersion spectrum. Blue has the higher frequency and smaller wave length than red at the other end of the visible spectrum.  So blue has a wave length about 0.00005cms and red about double that. So the shorter wave length blue bends more, slows more and has a higher refractive index than red.\r<br>A microwave oven has about a 12cm wave length. This is a much longer wave length than visible spectrum red. Therefore oven microwaves have a much lower refractive index than any frequency in the visible spectrum. Therefore a microwave hitting a ball of water or lens surface in an oven will refract far less than if visible light hit the same lens surface.\r<br>The refractive index of water in the microwave spectrum is actually I am guessing about 0.00001X that in the visible spectrum. Not 10X as stated in this video.\r<br>So the microwaves are hardly bending or refracting at all when they hit the curved lens surface be it a grape or a ball of water in a bead. There is definitely no internal reflection within the ball of water amplifying or focusing the power of the microwaves.\r<br>This refractive, internal reflection, index theory does not explain how in the first experiment the flat surface of the grape was presented to the microwaves and yet the effect occurred. It also makes the assumption that the microwaves are linear in direction in an oven when they are not. Microwaves actually bounce around the walls of the oven loosing energy until they are absorbed by matter like water.\r<br> What is actually happening is the water molecules are heating up in the grape and at the point of greatest pressure encapsulation it is boiling and then those gaseous water molecules charged hydrogen arms are less restricted by neighbouring water molecules so they absorb and store more energy, then resonating and increasing in energy to such a level that the plasma effect can occur. So this superheated gas turning into plasma.\r<br>The surface of the water spheres (or grapes) are also electrically charged by the microwaves and the point at which they touch has the least negative charge. At that point is where the encapsulated plasma negative electrons head to burst out of the sphere. In its own heat the plasma rises in the microwave air eventually fading out while it makes the air probably around it glow.\r<br>So water in the grape is turned to steam at that point where there is the greatest encapsulation of mass or around the grape centre. That steam is super heated because the water molecules are less restricted thus amplifying their stored energy allowing them to reach the plasma state or phase. So the plasma already exists inside the grape and is also glowing if you look. The electrons in that plasma head towards the area of least negative charge which is the area where the grapes touch. It is the like negative surface charge on the grapes which is making the grapes move apart initially. As gravity forces them together again the negative charge on the surfaces moves away from the point of contact. This allows the point where the internal negative plasma wants to escape to.\r<br>Take care Mark\r<br>mark0417994412@<a href=\"http://gmail.com/\">gmail.com</a>", "comment_date": "2019-02-26T05:42:24Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Inacio Tasse", "comment_text": "I doubt anyone will read this but if you want it to get read by others give it a like.

You are still in sin and you are going hell. <br>The Goodnews (Gospel) is here, justice has come to this world!! All evil has ended. Jesus has come to save the world and coming back to judge this world, as all authority has been given to him by God. 15 All that the Father has is mine; therefore I said that he will take what is mine and declare it to you. (\u202dJohn\u202c \u202d16\u202c:\u202d15\u202c ESV)<br><br>Jesus Christ sacrificed his life on the cross and rose from the dead, he took the eternal and everlasting wrath of God, dying for you. Being punished for every sin you committed. If you humble yourself and believe in his work on the cross, you will be in a right relationship with God and get the gift of heaven. For we are all saved by faith. Not by good works, like all other false religions teach. These only one way to heaven and that&#39;s only through Jesus Christ! Fact! So believe now, while you still have the chance, for you never know when the end will come and you will have answer for all your sins. It only takes one sin go to hell, so let Jesus&#39;s righteous cover your sins forever, for he has paid for them. A you have to do is have faith in this message.<br><br>16 &quot;For God so loved the world, that he gave his only Son, that whoever believes in him should not perish but have eternal life. 17 For God did not send his Son into the world to condemn the world, but in order that the world might be saved through him. 18 Whoever believes in him is not condemned, but whoever does not believe is condemned already, because he has not believed in the name of the only Son of God. 19 And this is the judgment: the light has come into the world, and people loved the darkness rather than the light because their works were evil. 20 For everyone who does wicked things hates the light and does not come to the light, lest his works should be exposed. 21 But whoever does what is true comes to the light, so that it may be clearly seen that his works have been carried out in God.&quot; (\u202dJohn\u202c \u202d3\u202c:\u202d16-21\u202c ESV)<br><br>The end is here, as soon in God&#39;s prophecy of the soon future.<br>1 But understand this, that in the last days there will come times of difficulty. 2 For people will be lovers of self, lovers of money, proud, arrogant, abusive, disobedient to their parents, ungrateful, unholy, 3 heartless, unappeasable, slanderous, without self-control, brutal, not loving good, 4 treacherous, reckless, swollen with conceit, lovers of pleasure rather than lovers of God, 5 having the appearance of godliness, but denying its power. Avoid such people. 6 For among them are those who creep into households and capture weak women, burdened with sins and led astray by various passions, 7 always learning and never able to arrive at a knowledge of the truth.

Here&#39;s what I see: the grape- or water gel bead- is functioning as a meta-material (and you should look up the Bell Labs work of Shively, who made artificial dielectric microwave lenses); the grapes are essentially both antennas and cavity resonators and because of their shape are also functioning as refractive lenses,  just like the Bell microwave lenses but using the cavity effect rather than a passing microwave front. IOWs, the microwave energy is coming from the inside out rather than being supplied from outside the &quot;lense&quot;. (What I mean is,  the plasma is from <b>concentrated</b> microwave energy,  which the microwaves inside the oven aren&#39;t normally able to do. But when the resonance inside the cavity takes place,  THAT concentrated and focused energy is what is making the plasma generation possible.) In fact,  like Anton van Leuwenhouk&#39;s(sp?)  glass bead microscopes,  the focal point is almost on the surface of the sphere,  which helps explain why when two of them are touching it becomes essentially focused on the point of contact and able to swap back and forth between the two grapes...<br><br>For me,  it means I may start experimenting with 2.4 GHz solid dielectric antennas- omni-directional radiators of a size dictated by the dielectric constant of the material with a piece of coax terminated at the center of a sphere. It doesn&#39;t have to be water inside- it could be plastic or glass,  as long as the diameter  and dielectric constant gave a one wavelength cavity resonator.

This would be at par with laser cutting technologies used in diamond cutting by just using common non-amplified light from a common source (such as the sun) to get through hard surfaces. I&#39;m saying this because the nano-applications could be quite obvious and straight-forward. When we need to scale-up, these quantum effects get lost and need to be better controlled, contained and carried forward.

And I don&#39;t remember that my science teachers discussed such thing, what I remember is that they only said we have a core, its in the center, its very hot blah blah blah, or maybe they&#39;ve mention it but I was kind of  busy chatting with my seatmate at the time). And like we also have moon that although not in same size of the earth but affects the concentration of heat , so it is not always in the center meaning the heat concentration goes in the position where the moon is at its closest distance on earth, which explains factors like climates and season, because when heat concentration goes to eastern part of the earth, the western part will be cold and this means ancient calendars are indeed more beneficial to humans, because ancient civilization based their calendars on the behavior and positions of the moon. And this also explains why gravitational forces in different pats of the world are not the same.

If not, then how large can the contact point be to still show the effect?  Would it happen if the interiors of the grapes were in actual physical contact, or must the &quot;skin&quot; be present to separate them?  Would it happen with two objects that did not have a &quot;skin&quot; or other separating layer?  Must that layer be at least partially conductive or will it happen with insulating materials such as plastic or glass?  How thick can the layer be before the effect no longer happens and it behaves like two separate objects?  How was the index of refraction calculated?

The small path will have a higher electric resistance which will result in more heat beeing generated which can lead to plasma. The interesting thing is that this dipole can be made from many different materials. From small metal pieces to meat or wet toothpicks (it didn&#39;t work..

The grape is not really important here, if you can design a tuned spherical cavity resonator with an outlet and tune the microwave emitter wavelength and position to focus the microwaves in the center of the resonator, with a single outlet, and produce massive amplification, you can produce thrust in a vacuum from only microwaves! You could even boost this by adding a valve on the outlet, and an injector where you can put in tiny amounts of hydrogen or xenon or argon in the chamber, which gives you basically a pulse detonation microwave plasma engine! Microwaves heat up the gas, cause it to expand and raise pressure in the chamber, at which point the valve opens exhausting the plasma and the microwaves in one massive pulse of thrust. You can run the engine with no propellant, valve open, for essentially infinite ISP and constant trickle acceleration (so long as you can generate electricity) AND boost it with hydrogen, xenon or argon if you need more momentary thrust, such as for deceleration! Also, this implies that you can pretty much build these engines at any scale, provided you can accommodate the resonator size and emitter wavelength and power.", "comment_date": "2019-02-18T23:11:49Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Shane Flett", "comment_text": "When you hold the camera, It makes me feel as if im talking to you in person, just standing there. when vsauce does his videos, it feels like a show. your style i like, more information intake, more focused and concentrated on the video and learning. just a thing i thought you&#39;d like to know.", "comment_date": "2019-02-18T23:10:47Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "-_-naab-_-", "comment_text": "Eats grapes before.
