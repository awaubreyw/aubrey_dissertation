When we sweep or wipe up dust we are observing a volume of dust, which is affected by electrostatic interactions and volume of the particles themselves. I suspect that dead skin cells make up a very small portion of the volume of a given amount of dust, as the keratin will act to mediate electrostatic charge, allowing them to occupy a smaller space. Instead, dead skin will act like a glue, allowing higher densities of positive charged particles and settling them out. I believe the actual volume of skin cells in a sample of dust is a fraction of a percent, by virtue of the square cube law and looking at the quantity of larger particles.

Didn&#39;t you ever notice that Coca-Cola still spends millions in advertising every year, despite the fact that you don&#39;t know of a single person who hasn&#39;t at least tried Coke at some point in their lives?<br><br>The answer is: Most advertising is not about selling a specific product; it&#39;s about keeping a positive brand image. Brand is so, so important for big companies that want to last. Sure, you use Google for search now. But what if another competitor springs up? The more you trust the brand, the less likely you are to even <b>consider</b> switching to another service. And then there&#39;s all their non-search products that you may be using. Maybe you&#39;ll choose an Android phone over an iPhone, because Google &quot;feels&quot; like a less evil corporation than Apple. Maybe you&#39;ll get a Chromebook? <br><br>And then there&#39;s potential future developments. Imagine you&#39;re a company that is developing future technologies that might be controversial, say, I don&#39;t know, driverless cars, or artificial intelligence. Then you&#39;d want to maintain a high degree of public trust in your brand so you will have some advantage over your competitors when you launch those technologies. So you might try, for example, to present your company as trustworthy, one that takes truth and openness very seriously.

You briefly mention conservation of mass, but given your videos on weight gain and loss, you know it&#39;s more complicated than that.  For example, if I eat a pound of donuts, is it true that I can&#39;t gain more than a pound from eating them?  I don&#39;t know the details, but I imagine it involves considering how calories are stored as fat, fat contains water, and so the carbs from the donuts are converted to cells that contain water that could weigh more than the donuts I ate.  Couldn&#39;t the dust mites gain more weigh than the skin cells they eat?  They must intake moisture too.

The answer it appears is from the air. Dust mite populations and their ability to grow and reproduce is governed by the relative humidity. Once the RH goes above a critical value they can thrive.

That in it&#39;s self surprised me!<br>Old man story:  back in 2011, I was interviewed for an IT job.  The manager was unavailable and the program manager pulled his lead malware analyst to do my technical interview.  Literally as we passed his desk.  I am in no way a malware analyst.  And he really didn&#39;t know what was involved in the job I was applying for.  So he asked a lot of deep Windows questions that in retrospect, I&#39;m proud I was able to answer as well as I did.  But most of the answers I gave were &quot;I&#39;d Google it&quot;.  And interestingly, that was the right answer.  I didn&#39;t try to BS my way through, but explained that I knew how to find out what I needed to know quickly.<br>When I&#39;ve interviewed applicants myself, I discuss searching with them.  I ask them how they search and often give them examples to show me how they would go about getting the appropriate answer.  Like you mention, asking what you think the answer is isn&#39;t always the correct approach.   Sometimes asking a broader question gives you a better discussion.  Of course asking too broad a question often gives you such an unfocused result, you never find your answer.  Also, understanding the problem is required.  I&#39;ve seen so many people having a superficial understanding of the problem and spending days on the internet trying to find an answer.<br>Anyway...  I don&#39;t work for Google.  I&#39;m an IT security guy with 35 years experience and have used a lot of search engines over the years.

When I reminded her of this fact, and that what they were reciting was partially my creation, albeit a highly derivative one.  They didn&#39;t want to believe me.  And so off to google we went, to find that indeed the answer was nowhere to be seen on the internet.  And so the full version, as I taught it my niece goes thusly:<br><br>How much wood, would a woodchuck, chuck, if a woodchuck could chuck wood?<br>A woodchuck, would chuck, as much wood, as a woodchuck could, if a woodchuck, could chuck wood.<br><br>Silly I know, but apparently many of the students found it amusing enough that it was being sung around campus all the time.  Which really goes to show, that we can never really know how far our words reach out into the world.  And as such, so too should we endeavor to make them words of which we can be proud.
