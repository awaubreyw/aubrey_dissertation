Nice video, but I wanted to point out your imprecise statement about what is actually a very common misconception. When asked about the topology of our universe (its shape, in the word of the kid in the video), you respond speaking about curvature. While it is true that, given a topology of spacetime, not all curvatures are compatible with it (or, viceversa, fixing some properties of the curvature, not all topologies are allowed), it is by no means true that flat implies diffeomerphic to R^n. You know, for instance you can put a flat metric on a torus. So zero curvature, bt you do hit the back of your head when you fire a gun forward. So even though all observations seem to point to zero curvature of spacetime, This does not mean that the universe is just R^4.", "comment_date": "2018-01-16T00:58:39Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "vedicKar", "comment_text": "You both are awesome!!", "comment_date": "2017-12-16T05:01:38Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Fer NaN Do", "comment_text": "Guy! 500 Thousand subs on this video.

I mean, it&#39;s not new information to me that galaxies are growing increasingly farther apart, but I don&#39;t necessarily understand why they are, and why they aren&#39;t just sorta hanging out with the rest of the galaxies instead. (Over a lottt of time, anyways.) Also, considering space is infinite, why wouldn&#39;t we consider to assume that this is one of those random chance things, and that in the future it&#39;d be unlikely that every existing galaxy is isolated, because they&#39;re bound to be floatin&#39; towards some new galaxies? <br><br>edit (<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ro2MmmdARrs&amp;t=4m59s\">4:59</a>): Oh.. ha okay well I guess my question is still kinda standing?

Logically, randomness makes no sense anyway, in a system that functions purely on direct interactions between fields.  The &quot;uncertainty principle&quot; is a dangerous misunderstanding in QM in regards to the difficulty in measuring the effects of the atomic realm when approaching it from particle logic.  The uncertainty principle is the issue where your observational tool interferes with the experiment itself - this was perpetuated via the double slit experiment, which is actually incorrectly reviewed.  I, and many others have reproduced the laser experiments, to discover it can have the interference pattern with a single slit, or even around a sewing needle.  When elaborating the experiment and using the erasers, you can bypass the supposed &quot;neutralization of interference&quot; which made people believe in particle-wave duality, and gain a result that&#39;s not only predictable, but measurable and has no randomness.<br><br>Laser light is coherent light, and known from holography art, that when split is can create a fractal effect in which every part of the image contains the whole image: this is called incommensurability.

Light does not travel in straight line as so many scientists are willing to state, It is affected in many ways by gravity from planets, suns and various massive bodies and clusters, each doing it&#39;s utmost to deflect the straight path of the photons. So yes the light traveling away from the earth could, and I say could not does, return to bite your bum, metaphorically speaking.<br>Regards to all.

During the travel period of most photons they are able to pick up and lose energy (check up on gravity lensing). In doing this they shift their spectral signature due to the increase of photonic energy. In other words the red and blue shift of photonic energy associated with light cannot be used as a guide to the speed of any cosmological body, be it a planet or a galactic mass. Due to interaction with planets, stars and even black holes, the photons can and do increase energy levels which will cause a spectral shift towards the blue. As the photons move away from planets, stars and even black holes, they move away under the gravity effect of the body&#39;s and will subsequently exhibit a shift towards the red because the photons are under the gravity effect and use up more of their energy than when they are being attracted by gravity. This effect is ignored by most cosmologists and causes problems like insufficient calculated matter in the cosmos to cause closure. Excessive expansion of the cosmos and lastly the need for dark matter and dark energy, which in actuality do not exist, except as a reason for the scientists to believe that they haven&#39;t made a colossal error. Imagine the cosmos with all it&#39;s matter expanding at the speed of light. Imagine also making a calculation of the total amount of matter in the universe and achieving a 95% error and attributing that error to the existence of DARK MATTER and DARK ENERGY. I ask you! Believe what you will, but please not everything the scientists tell you.

Zoom in on this motion picture to its fundamental building blocks.

(For instance, science tells us Bee&#39;s shouldn&#39;t be able to fly, yet they do.) Having said that, would you say that intelligent design would be a possible solution for the things Science can&#39;t explain? For example, though I agree with allot of the THEORIES that science presents about the shape of our universe and the speed of light, It could also be argued that these details are not proven and possibly incorrect. For example how can we honestly say that nothing can accelerate beyond the speed of light? We haven&#39;t even come close to reaching that speed, so how on earth would we know? Or who surveyed the universe and came to the conclusion that it was flat? Granted math and physics both present convincing data and believeable arguments about the why our universe is the way it is but you have to agree, the majority of what we &quot;KNOW&quot; about our universe is highly intelligent and well thought out... theory. Therefore you could argue that what is unexplainable was probably designed to be, well unexplainable. By whom or what and why? To protect us from our own curiosity which could lead to our own destruction?

Viewing it at a slow pace, it would almost look like the opposite of redshifting, as the first rays of light to hit the person once back beyond that dreadful point of no return, would scatter the light back to the viewer, with the red light taking the longest to reach him/her. Blueshifting, perhaps? It&#39;s also quite possible that light, coming so close to that point of a black hole which can stop it in it&#39;s track, would be quite slow in reaching the viewer, in which case the effects described would be compounded, and there&#39;s likely to be some blurring, which would decrease\u00a0as the person gets further out of the black hole.<br><br>Anyway, from the view of the person escaping that point in the gravity well, I can&#39;t exactly say.
