I don&#39;t know the future like that.<br><br>One thing that I have also learned from the Old Testament especially by how this YouTube channel called &quot;Bibleproject&quot; explained is that Jehovah is not so merciless as we make him out to be.<br><br>The cities that he destroyed in the Old Testament is EXACTLY how he destroyed evil.<br><br>It&#39;s not about his wrath, it&#39;s about the people that made him have to put his wrath on them.<br><br>There is a verse on Babylonians about how horrible these people are that made God &quot;regret&quot; making man (Translation: I wish humans would make wiser decisions)<br><br>Just because we humans are able to do evil, does not mean that&#39;s how He intended for us to be. We were supposed to be sinless like Adam and Eve before they ate the apple.<br><br>People have also misunderstood the innocence of Adam and Eve&#39;s like &quot;If they were pure in heart then they can&#39;t help then to eat the apple&quot; the Innocence that the Bible was talking about is when Adam and Eve were naked in front of each other and not ashamed.<br><br>When God told them not to eat the tree of knowledge they now know what they&#39;re not supposed to do. <br><br>And because they know what they&#39;re not supposed to do, they have a choice not to eat the tree of knowledge but they CHOSE to rebel against God anyway.<br><br>God put that tree of knowledge in the garden of Eden because it is a TEST.<br><br>The reason why God would test them even though he knew they would fail, is because he sees more than one future he sees one where they will NOT sin against Him and that everybody will be sinless and living in the garden of Eden.<br><br>Everybody has more then one future it all depends on the path that they take.<br><br>The tree of knowledge is his way of giving them a choice. If it wasn&#39;t for sin God wouldn&#39;t have to show his mercy.<br><br>The mercy is the fact that God allowed them to live as a way of giving them a second chance to return to Him before things got really bad.<br><br>God is gentle himself, that&#39;s why we have the free will to rebel against him whenever we want, cuz he does not want us to be obligated into being Christian.<br> I&#39;m Christian and I can leave God whenever I want to but I have DECIDED ON MY OWN not to.<br><br>&quot;You don&#39;t know how disrespectful kids can be until you really have them&quot; - Daquan Wiltshire<br><br>People always feel the need to see to believe but Jesus has performed miracles RIGHT IN FRONT OF THE NON-BELIEVERS and they STILL didn&#39;t believe it.<br><br>This is why we say &quot;Walk by faith and not by sight&quot;.<br><br>So whether you want to get to know Jesus or not that&#39;s your choice.<br><br>People also be talking about how prayer didn&#39;t work but it&#39;s really about your mindset with the prayer.<br><br>1. When you pray did you pray with CONFIDENCE or did you pray with DOUBT? When you pray with doubt God is going to delay your prayer. When you pray with confidence it will happen. Maybe not today, maybe not tomorrow, but it will happen.<br><br>2. Were you patient?<br><br>3. Did you pray for what you NEED or did you pray for what you WANT?<br>God gives you whatever you want WITHOUT prayer, but when it comes to what you NEED, pray to him.<br>But when it comes to certain things that you want (Hoes, drugs, etc.) it doesn&#39;t always mean that God actually gave it to you.<br><br>4. Did you WORK to get your prayers answered?<br><br>Jesus is like That One Roommate you have who be all like: &quot;Oh don&#39;t worry about this, I got what you need, don&#39;t worry about that, I&#39;ll provide this, that, the other just relax!&quot;, but once you get TOO comfortable, he/she starts being like &quot;So what you doing for me besides slugging around? I&#39;m sitting here paying the rent, you should be doing SOMETHING! Why aren&#39;t you cleaning? Why aren&#39;t you washing the dishes? We&#39;re supposed to be a TEAM in this. This is not just your house this is OUR house&quot;<br><br>Jesus is not like that one roommate He IS that one roommate!<br><br>Christianity (A.K.A., Jews in denial) does not equal perfection it&#39;s about sinners working to get better with themselves and to get better in Jesus.<br><br>Jesus died for us cuz NOBODY is perfect.<br><br>And when God answers your prayers when it comes to illnesses sometimes he uses doctors to help you with that.<br><br>But when he performs that miracle by himself you got to talk that miracle into life. You got to speak life into yourself.<br><br>Any other supernatural thing besides the miracles, you got to admit that you are a sinner, Believe that Jesus is God who died for our sins, Repent and Invite him into your life to see for yourself.<br><br>And once you do allow God into your life to guide you to doing better, NOT BEING PERFECT! Doing better, you will see things in a different perspective.<br><br>And if you ever decide to convert to Judaism you WILL be VERY UNPOPULAR no matter how peaceful, how nice, or how respectful you are to people&#39;s decisions not to be Jewish. Saying the word &quot;God&quot; in general is enough to trigger everybody.<br><br>&quot;Everybody hates Jews&quot; Christians ARE Jews, they just in denial like &quot;There is NO way I am a Jew, I haven&#39;t even experienced this that or the other&quot;<br><br>Miracles, supernatural things in general, they don&#39;t always HAVE to be big and obvious, they can be small and clever.<br><br>So either or, if you are able to experience these things in any way because you BELIEVE that Jesus is God, you ARE a Jew.<br><br>If you are a Child of God, you ARE a Jew.<br><br>The people in Jerusalem would only count as Jews if they were born and raised in the Old testament since they&#39;re stuck on the Old Testament.<br><br>Now ever since the New Testament, we have to go TO JESUS in order to be a TRUE Jew.

Explain this phenomenon.&quot; The answer they wanted to hear of course was that they were Klinefelter Cats with the genetic formula XXY. But I immediately protested saying that if the deactivation of an X chromosome is totally random, that would work out in a mixed color, not distinct spots. My teacher didn&#39;t know how to respond and ended up saying that the question was probably wrong. That was more than 20 years ago.

You&#39;re not entirely wrong, but you&#39;re also not right. The color RED is determined by sex chromosomes, all other colors are on other genes. Since male cats can only have a single X, that X will either be Red or Not Red, meaning you&#39;ll either end up with an all red male, or a male of a non-red color. But in females, since they have two X&#39;s, they can either have two Reds, meaning a red female cat, two Not Reds, meaning a non-red cat, or a Red and a Non Red, which results in a calico pattern for the reasons you described. Colors that you can have that aren&#39;t red are Black, Chocolate, or Cinnamon, and you can get other colors when those base colors are diluted either by the dilution gene, pointed gene, or any kind of tabby gene.

The deeper it goes underwater, the more it pushes back aginst the crushing forces around it. <br><br>This crushing force is fed through the rubber walls into the rubber pipes and struts inside the submarine and is continuously shifting, changing density and changing volume. <br>Even when completely still, the potential force stored in the elastic tissue is significant.<br><br>Any oscillations caused by sonic / seismic type energy the submarine encounters due to environmental noise AND internaly generated sound /pressure waves are altered by this potential force because density changes pitch, tone and volume. <br><br>The curved surfaces angle of the elastic membrane tissue changes as it is compressed and relaxed but even while still, acts as a parabolic sonic mirror to any internal vibrations,<br>curved egg shaped parabolic surfaces being the only efficient shape to deal with pressure differentials and bouyancy requirement. <br><br>Here for the rubber sub analogy to continue we have to fill the submarine with water and lift it onto the air, let&#39;s call it &quot;H.M.S. human body&quot; an anti submarine, whose job is to protect the water inside being evaporated off in all directions, and the sailors called kidneys, liver, spleen from being too dry or roughly treated.<br><br>The parabolic mirror shape of the fascia and skin type outer layer of the H.M.S. human body means that any regular sonic activity inside the submarine, eg.sailor heart playing his drums, will bounce around the watery internal cavities for a long time as water conducts sound brilliantly. <br> <br>As the sound waves bounce off the satelite dish shaped outer shell, in certain places in the &quot;human body&quot; the sound waves form standing waves and nodal lines of extra volume and relative silence , especially if someone left the sound system on and it is generating feedback in very tight high pitched ultrasonic frequencies, and very low throbbing infrasonic frequencies. <br><br>Air behaves like a fluid and creates 1.03kg of force per square centimeter at sea level, the human body has on average nealry 2 square metres of skin. <br>That is two tonnes of crushing force being generated at seal level relative to being on a planet such as Mars. <br>If one stand inside a large enough bell jar and releases the potential energy, ie create a vaccuum the body expands as the potetial energy is released.<br><br>Does that mean that through diligent practice one could gain the ability to dilate the central nervous system in it&#39;s entirety and release this potential energy in tiny, invisble ranges of movement?<br>Hell yes! you just have to learn to NOT think for long periods of time as thinking contracts the nerves.

For instance, lets say one patch of your brain that has your artistic ability has the X chromosome active that say increases your artistic ability somehow. You are an artist and that is part of your identity. But you get a new body, but somehow your new body has the brain part for artistic ability with the <i>other</i> X chromosome active, and that one has no special ability. So you lose your artistic ability. This could happen with anything, like personality, whatever.

I could just not watch the video, but I like learning just as much as any other person, and I enjoy Veritasium content.

But our own behaviour and environment further affects epigenetics when we grow up, and therefore, the affirmation is only valid (under this premise) for cases such as X-chromosome inactivation in women, because it&#39;s only in our earliest stages in life (as an embryo or a fetus) that our ancestors&#39; markers are still more relevant than those imposed by our own environment.\u00a0<br><br>Nevertheless, there&#39;s something deeper to take into account here. Recent trends in research point that epigenetic marking may sometimes modify recombination likelihood and patterns, as well as change the activity of repeating sequences in the DNA. That is, epigenetic marking can cause modifications in the original sequence, thus becoming a permanent (fixed) modification in the genetic information, rather than it being just an expression pattern.

If you keep the X chromosome coming from your dad mute, then every cell will express the X chromosome from your mom (which is not silenced). Therefore, women are not stripey.<br><br>Anyway, about the cats: I don&#39;t really know which chemical epigenetic methods they use (I think they are the same as in humans), but the fascinating thing about it is that their genes behave like the Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome does: by expressing both alleles randomly chosen in the embryonic state. Maybe they express both because their &quot;hair colour&quot; alleles behave like they have an extreme &quot;expression power&quot; so they don&#39;t even work with Mendelian laws or they even can&#39;t be metilated (silenced).<br><br>TL;DR: The title is a lie, pls explain more.", "comment_date": "2014-06-21T15:32:31Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Daniel Page", "comment_text": "Great subject....

Like how you can make dogs smaller by only breeding the small ones.<br><br>I wrote a paper in High School about how there must be an epigenetic mechanism\u00a0that\u00a0aids evolutionary changes.\u00a0I was talking about epigenetics, but didn&#39;t know what to call it at the time. My teacher insisted that I was wrong, and that the only way a genome could change was through random mutations to the coding.<br>I believe that the chemistry of DNA could have evolved to become more pliable to changes with a bottle neck in the population that favours certain traits; setting off a\u00a0reaction to make future generations more likely to exhibit phenotypic traits outside of the\u00a0previous population.\u00a0<br>It was my postulation that there was ample evidence to suggest that the chemistry of DNA has evolved to produce a mechanism that can favour certain genetic changes over others. One example\u00a0I gave was the selective breeding of corn crops in the USA during the\u00a0early 20th century\u00a0to produce corn with higher levels of oil than was previously seen in the genome of the corn they were working with. I postulated that by creating a bottle-neck effect in the population that \u00a0selected for individuals with higher oil content, after a few generations, the genetics had been changed by an epigenetic process that created genes now switched on for higher oil content. This example took a mere 5 years from what I remember.<br><br>A traditional genetic understanding would say that the selection had favoured higher oil content and random mutation had created the change that made oil content higher than in the previous population.<br><br>I have always believed that continued selective forces, like for higher oil content or smaller dogs, could create a tag on certain genes to make them more pliable to more change in that direction. This is an easy explanation for how these changes can come about in such a short number of generations.<br><br>Maybe I&#39;m way off with this; I&#39;m just not really sure because I don&#39;t know if this question has been addressed yet by the scientific community.<br><br>Thanks, I love your videos!", "comment_date": "2014-06-08T20:59:24Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Tesser Act", "comment_text": "Makes a lot of sense.

The calico male cat either has two Y chromosomes or a second X chromosome. So their chromosomes would look something like this XXY, XYY. The cat with XXY can have five colors and will almost always be female and the cat with XYY will have four colors and almost always be male.

Somthing feasible, somthing in theory if we knew enough about we could manipulate.... My problem however is that this theory is mostly based on experiments with space time.... Atomic clocks under low gravity in space and high velocity run slower then clocks on atomic clocks on earth. With these observations it has been concluded that time itself has slowed for the clocks in space and the astronauts in the space shuttle with it are theoretically younger then those people still on earth. So if this was true then if someone where to be put on a bus traveling the speed of light (something you proved to be impossible) a week could pass for the traveler as everyone else in existence would experience 100 years.... They would age much slower... I however believe that time is not a dimention but somthing that us humans have made up to Define the segments of waiting between events, a second is the duration of 9192631770 periods of the radiation corresponding to the transition between the two hyperfine levels of the ground state of the caesium 133 atom. At high velocity and low gravity the durations of radiation slow! Would this not only be an effect the velocity and gravity have on the atom and not that at high velocity and gravity time itself has slowed? For someone traveling at intense speed would it only FEEL like time is moving slower? Please, if you can or need a video topic, share your thoughts! Are we hypothetically able to time travel, or is it just somthing we as humans made up as a measurement.
