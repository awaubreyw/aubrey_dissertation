But because they interact the most with matter, they are shortest lived.<br><b>Beta particles</b> (fast Electrons) are less ionizing and less damaging than alpha. And because they interact less with matter than Alpha, they live longer and travel farther.<br><b>Gamma rays</b> (including X-rays and UV) are the least ionizing and damaging. And because Gamma interacts the least with matter, it penetrates the deepest.<br>The correlation is that the less time radiation spends interacting with matter, the farther it travels and the less damage it does (per unit of matter).<br>There are other forms of radiation too, beyond just Alpha, Beta and Gamma.<br><br>Seldom talked about is <b>Neutron radiation.</b><br>There are three types of sources of Neutron radiation.<br>Neutrons can be produced when Alpha particles bombard foils of Aluminum or other metals; this is called a <b>Neutron Gun.</b><br>Neutrons can also be produced when unstable atoms split, in a process called <b>Nuclear Fission.</b><br>Neutrons can also be produced through high-energy collision events involving particle accelerators or <b>Cosmic rays.</b><br>There are two categories of Neutron radiation, they are <b>Fast Neutrons</b> and <b>Slow Neutrons</b> (A.K.A. Thermal Neutrons or Moderated Neutrons).<br>There is a common misconception about Neutrons and nuclear chain reactions.<br>It is commonly believed that fast neutrons split atoms by bombarding them.<br>The truth is that fast neutrons interact very little with matter, thus are unlikely to split atoms.<br>Slow neutrons (or thermal neutrons) are the types of neutrons primarily responsible for nuclear chain reactions.<br>It is a misconception that water in a nuclear reactor is used to suppress (or &quot;moderate&quot;) the nuclear reaction.<br><b>Control Rods</b> made of Boron or Boron compounds which easily absorb neutrons are used to suppress the reaction; the control rods are not the moderators.<br>In a <b>Light-Water Reactor,</b> the water is the <b>Moderator</b> (not the Rods), which absorbs the kinetic energy of fast neutrons through bombardment.<br>The water molecules that absorb the kinetic energy of fast neutrons become hot (regulated to a temperature of about 400\u00b0C) and serve to spin turbines for electricity.<br>As a result, the fast neutrons lose kinetic energy and become slow neutrons.<br>The slow neutrons that come in contact with nuclear fuel interact more with the fuel, promoting the nuclear reaction.<br>Thus, exposing more water to reacting fissile material promotes the reaction.<br><br>Yet another type of radiation is <b>Proton radiation.</b><br><b>Proton flux</b> primarily comes from the Sun as a component of <b>Cosmic radiation.</b> It also comes from other stars too, but the Sun is chief.<br>Unlike Alpha particles which are short-lived, Protons penetrate deep into the Earth&#39;s atmosphere and reach the ground.<br>When you fly high on an airplane, you get exposed to many more protons than what you experience on the ground or even in a nuclear power plant.<br>The energy of some cosmic protons is higher than what is producible by CERN.<br>If CERN is really making micro black holes, then we should have many black holes raining on us every second of the day.<br>Protons that strike the Atmosphere shatter atoms in the air.<br>The sheer kinetic energy of cosmic protons alone forces fission on light atoms through bombardment, unlike the neutrons that split heavy unstable atoms.<br>When atoms in the atmosphere are shattered, they release a plethora of other types of radiation, including neutrons, protons and in some cases <b>Muons.</b><br>The neutrons released by the shattered atoms get absorbed by Nitrogen-14 atoms which release more [slower] protons and decay into Carbon-14.<br>Carbon-14 combines with Oxygen to form slightly radioactive Carbon dioxide which gets absorbed by plants and eaten by animals and humans.<br><br><b>Muon radiation</b> which is emitted during the shattering of atoms are particles similar to electrons but much heavier and can be produced by CERN.<br>Protons capable of producing Muons in the atmosphere only come from Exploding stars, not the Sun.<br>The Muons from shattered atoms are also such high energy that their half-life is extended through <b>Special Relativity;</b> this means that cosmic muons decay slower than the muons produced by CERN.<br>Since cosmic muons are so fast, they interact very little with matter.<br>Since cosmic muons also have extended half-life, they penetrate deeper than other known natural forms of radiation.<br>Cosmic muons can penetrate solid granite several thousand feet.<br>In recent times, Cosmic Muons have been used to photograph hidden chambers inside the Pyramids and are further being developed to photograph the hidden chambers inside of volcanoes.<br>The technology that utilizes Muons to take photographs is called <b>Muography.</b>", "comment_date": "2018-07-12T04:36:36Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Nabin Devkota", "comment_text": "Awesome!

But, in fact, they can&#39;t. Not the way an atomic bomb or war head would, at least. <br><br>If you don&#39;t understand the process of nuclear fission, then my explanation probably won&#39;t make sense. <br><br>In order for a nuclear explosion to happen, you need to have a certain amount of the right element to cause a large enough chain reaction. To get that sized chain reaction, it takes roughly 101 lbs of Uranium 235 (235U) and I&#39;m not sure of the amount of Plutonium 238 required. This is called critical mass. Power plants have less than critical mass and, therefore, can not explode like a nuke would explode. The cooling system can fail, though, causing the plant to have a &quot;melt down&quot; where the reactor gets so hot that it melts everything around it. I am not aware of any pressure cooker type system that could explode, however, I could be mistaken on that.<br><br>Nuclear fission works like this: Say you have slab 235U. This is made up of millions of atoms. One of those atoms bets hit by a neutron, causing it to split. When the uranium splits, it splits, normally, into two different elements, krypton and barium. These are called fission products. When it splits, it also releases a few more neutrons, which collide into other uranium atoms continuing the reaction, initiating the chain reaction. If you were to take the uranium atom and the fission products and place them on a scale, you would see that the whole atom weighed more than all of the products following the splitting of it. During the fission process, mass is lost from the original atom and is not in the fission products. <br><br>According to the equation E=mc2, all mass has and can be converted into energy. In this equation, E is energy, m is mass and c2 is the speed of light squared. To you could say that energy is equal to the mass of an object times the speed of light squared. If you were to take some kind of mass and destroy it completely so it no longer exists at all, it would be completely turned into energy. How much energy? The mass of the object times c2, or the speed of light squared. The speed of light is about 186,000 m/sec. Squaring that and then multiplying it by the mass of the object creates and enormous number. So a little mass can produce a lot of energy. <br><br>As I said, mass was lost in the fission process. Lost, destroyed, gone. Poof! Basing that off the Einstein&#39;s law E=mc2, even that small amount of mass turns into a lot of energy. And, it turns out, Dr. Crazy Hair was right on. That is exactly what happens! The mass is lost and energy is created in the form of heat. <br><br>Now, the chain reaction is growing exponentially, so mass is being lost exponentially which means that energy in the form of heat is being created exponentially. With the release of all this energy, it begins to pile up on itself and over lap. When enough element is under fission, or the critical mass as it is called, the energy will pile up enough to explode. This is how the first A-Bombs worked and still work today. However, power plants do not have the critical mass of the element used to cause an explosion.<br><br>I hope that I was clear and not confusing, as well as helpful.
