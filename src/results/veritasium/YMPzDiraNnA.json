I&#39;m currently 25, fresh out of college with a girlfriend who&#39;s wrapping up her master&#39;s degree... we have our whole lives ahead of us. We&#39;ve understood that we both want to try and break through the lower-middle class upbringing we have (both going to college is more than most in our families have done) but watching this video (among some others from you) made us realize that we have to step outside of our comfort zone and expose ourselves to really accomplish something and/or be acknowledged for it. We grew up being told that going to college would &quot;guarantee&quot; our lives would be better than those before us. I&#39;ve always appreciated somebody who can step away from the norm to talk about how real life works because sticking to whats expected of you may not always help people reach their potential. Youve been a phenominal channel to watch because youre educational when it comes to science and facts, but also when it comes to general life advice. Sometimes you have to question things, or try harder, or make yourself uncomfortable in order to accomplish even the simplest of tasks, let alone having something significant haooen. We not only watch for learning little facts or science &quot;know how&quot;, but we watch because you seem to have grown as a person. Keep up the amazing work! A life isn&#39;t made by sitting idle and waiting for accomplishments to find you, but you&#39;ve also made us understand that working as hard as we can while only communicating with two or three people doesn&#39;t allow for growth. We both look forward to, what is hopefully, our long lives together... meeting people, learning, helping others learn, and never stopping to accept that we&#39;ve &quot;found the final solution&quot; to anything. There&#39;s always room for improvement, and sometimes it isn&#39;t how you&#39;d like to go about it. Thank you for all the education you&#39;ve given us. I truly hope that you see this comment amongst the flurry of daily comments you get, and it gives you just a little bit of drive to do what you&#39;ve been doing one day longer. Sometimes one video, or one sentence even, can be the push to make somebody else realize their own potential. I hope one day I can be that catalyst in somebody else&#39;s life.

For context: my school had in the lockdown purposefully cut down on school hours, bc they didn&#39;t want us to sit behind our computer for the whole day (but i guess in a chair in a classroom is completely different?). I had in the meantime really gotten used to this shortened school day and it really worked well with me mentally, so when we went back to normal hours I succummed over the long  days (and not only the long days, but also suddenly there was constant noise of everyone talking and I constantly had to move from one place to another and I couldnt focus on one subject for a long period of time bc suddenly i had to move again) when I got home I didn&#39;t have the time or energy to work on any homework. <br><br>So I became very angry at the school system and all that. One day we had to fill in this &quot;growth paper&quot; or something, which basically asked how I had been doing and what I could be doing differently next year and what the school could do to help me. Out of pure frustration I filled in &quot;have less school hours&quot;, not thinking it would do anything. But then I had a conversation with my mentor (idk if you guys have this on America, but it&#39;s basically a teacher you can contact if you need help or anything is wrong. They in general hava a better bond with their class (every mentor has their own mentor class)) and just when the conversation was about to end, she leaned over the table and said: &quot;if next year gets really tough, you can come talk to me and I&#39;ll see what I can do.&quot; <br><br>The next year rolls around I talk to her and now I don&#39;t have to follow all school hours and I feel much better, a lot more relaxed and my grades are doing a lot better.

I was never able to do studying without someone telling me what to do and it took me around a year to get over it and I just realised it was learned helplessness. It was definitely damaging and I am glad I know what it was now. After that, I became a lot more independent and studying was a lot easier for me, it was also easier for me to deal with a lot of different real-life situations as I had to do things on my own quite a lot. I think one thing about school as said in this video is that you learn to follow, not to lead and that is probably the greatest flaw in the education system. People are growing up not knowing how to deal with things and are probably struggling with things that would be so much easier if we learnt better.

Now what im getting ready to say or ask may seem racist but i dint mean it to be. Im just asking the question. Could it be that some black children raised in an environment that their parents always blame their situation on racism against them and there isnt anything that can be dine about it. But \u00e0 black child raised in another country and always hearing that if they were in the united states they would have more opportunities. So when they get here they take advantage of all the things available and tend to elevate themselves to a better existence? Because it seems to me that some of the people yelling the loudest are the same ones that do nothing to better their environment. Could the reason for this be learned helplessness? Why someone raised in america doesn&#39;t achieve the same level of successes as an immigrant that comes here with only the notion that if you work hard enough you can achieve greatness in america? I personally know some of my black friends have not tried to do certain things because they think that it is a white thing and they wouldnt be able to get that job....or live in that place ....or go to the school. They grew up with parents that lived in the 60s and are told that there is no reason to try because black people cant do that because a white person wont let them. I know racism does exist but i wonder how many black kids are discouraged by their parents to even try to do something because racism wont allow them. Could some of that type of thinking be considered learned helplessness?

Even though we only had 400 students in my high school, we also had advanced placement (Freshman college level) math and history classes, and a professional internship program during summers to get experience with local professionals. <br><br>I guess it just matters which school you go to. I agree it also matters what your parents teach you.

I truly appreciate it and believe society as a large majority has sadly gone in this direction inadvertently.<br><br>I am a service plumber in Chicago. What that means is, I am the individual who comes out to troubleshoot the problem the occupants are experiencing. When I first began, I was literally hand the keys to a truck a told &quot;Go figure it out&quot;. At first I was terrified of screwing up anything and everything. I found myself to have an extremely high disregard for my own initial impression of executing the job process. Calling on my manager and fellow plumbers I found they were quite often only confirming what I already knew. After all they weren&#39;t the ones on site to see the issue first hand. <br><br>Occasionally I&#39;m paired with an apprentice. I love these days. I&#39;ve a great joy sharing my knowledge with incoming &quot;kids&quot;.

I purposefully give them a task to do on their own with minimal explanation to basically follow in Edison&#39;s path of &quot;I&#39;ve just found 10,000 ways that won&#39;t work&quot;. If they give up or to say &quot;it can&#39;t be done&quot;. This is when they will most pay attention to you solving the problem. They want to be &quot;so right&quot; in their conclusion, they want to see their instructor fail. They will focus on every moment. When done, they tend to forever remember that frustrated event to recall and utilize in the future. <br><br>There are 1,000s of ways to do plumbing as long as the same result is acquired in the end (Hot&#39;s on the left, water goes down and it doesn&#39;t smell). <br><br>We all need to think for ourselves more.

I&#39;m just finishing a Bachelors in IT (Google it and all you&#39;ll see are articles raving about how many opportunities are in IT, how much it&#39;s growing per year etc) and despite 5 years in school and a pile of debt I&#39;m realizing my classes haven&#39;t taught me a darn thing I can actually use. I&#39;m more tech smart from experience learning, but that&#39;s it.<br><br>Now take the job market for these careers. Entry level requires almost always at least two or three years of experience, which used to be gained from internships. Now I find myself getting almost daily declination emails for these internships due to a *lack of experience*. People used to say &quot;Oh, just go get some certifications, they prove that someone with no exp knows what they&#39;re doing enough to pass a test&quot; but if you Google about certifications you also find a pile of stories saying how it&#39;s a coin flip whether the hiring manager respects your cert, or whether they say &quot;A+ Certified?

He must be a complete moron!&quot;.<br><br>From there you think &quot;Well, what if I just teach myself how to do it and make a porfolio?&quot;.

Most of these things are not feasible to even practice or self-teach in a non-professional environment.<br><br>Networking has become a four-letter word to me, because it went from a nice extra thing you could do to make finding a job a little easier to basically a huge and singular requirement to getting a job in a technical field. What I&#39;ve been able to see of IT is mostly brown-nosing and IT managers who impress me by being able to tie their shoes without assistance, yet I walk in with more than a passing knowledge of the field and the ability and willingness to learn, and I&#39;m shunted aside for someone who has a mean golf game and made friends with the hiring agents..<br><br>I&#39;m sure I can apply this to a lot of things, but sometimes the issue really has nothing to do with learned helplessness.", "comment_date": "2021-05-30T15:09:54Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "ab cd", "comment_text": "Very true Derek, very true.", "comment_date": "2021-05-30T14:56:35Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Edward Villa", "comment_text": "I really needed this.

Many times, not just me, but within others (I studied psychology and deeply fascinated with it, as well as science), is that internal problem solving tends to be different than external. Many times people need what is referred to as a &quot;sounding board&quot;; someone they can vocalize the problem they are stumped on. Many times it is actually better to use someone as a &quot;sounding board&quot; that has very limited knowledge of that subject, because they you are having to simplify all the jargon for them to at least follow somewhat. And that simplification, as well as vocalization, makes your brain view the problem from a different perspective, and the answer becomes rather obvious.<br>Also, later on about children learning in school, and that becoming Learned Helplessness. Not sure I agree completely, though maybe just another viewpoint. Part of the idea of school is social interaction, not just learning the basic subjects. Teachers (good ones at least) encourage students to ask for help. Group projects are meant to help them work together, share ideas, and expand their viewpoints. Something I&#39;ve constantly repeated to our son ever since he was little was that any problem, school, personal, relationship, etc, it&#39;s pretty much a guaranty that many people have had the same problem of some sort and know the answer. He should never feel like he has a problem he doesn&#39;t know the answer to, and be afraid to ask.", "comment_date": "2021-03-07T13:09:31Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "harshit negi", "comment_text": "thank you", "comment_date": "2021-03-07T11:47:54Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Spyziy", "comment_text": "looks like a minecraft sculpture of a whale in the thumbnail lmaoo", "comment_date": "2021-03-06T23:23:01Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "MASTER nobody", "comment_text": "become one percent better everyday", "comment_date": "2021-03-06T18:44:16Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "\u064b", "comment_text": "He&#39;s almost 40 now, wow", "comment_date": "2021-03-06T18:04:22Z", "likes_count": 15}, {"comment_by": "UnderCasual", "comment_text": "Yes thank you", "comment_date": "2021-03-06T06:26:53Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "fireroum", "comment_text": "<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YMPzDiraNnA&amp;t=5m43s\">5:43</a>... starting to tear up.", "comment_date": "2021-03-04T21:46:42Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Ricardo Simion", "comment_text": "Thanks!", "comment_date": "2021-03-04T18:50:04Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Live Voxel", "comment_text": "I keep going back to this video to remind myself i have control over myself.

Instead of going to school and following the traditional pattern, only to come out of college as ignorant as everyone else, I could blaze a new trail.

We shoudn&#39;t live the past and let the present fly by, i get furious at myself sometimes by my stupidity when i say everything that has ever happened to me was a disaster, the moment i say that i fail every single good memory i have of my life, every laugh i had with my friends, every good memory i have of my family, everything i may have forgot about myself. <br>Maybe i am doing the right thing, but instead of acknowledging it, all i keep doing is say &quot;What if i was that?&quot;. Imagine being something only you can be, and yet you wish to be something else, while you are iluded by the fact that you think it would make you feel better, when, in fact, it would only make you miss what you were. Change the world around you, but don&#39;t change yourself when the world stops and demands it from you. Don&#39;t accept it. <br><br>&quot;The two most important days of your life are the day you are born, and the day you find out why.&quot; -Mark Twain.", "comment_date": "2020-08-31T10:53:18Z", "likes_count": 2}, {"comment_by": "\u0416\u0438\u0437\u043d\u044c \u0413\u043b\u0443\u0445\u0438\u0445", "comment_text": "\u0432\u043e\u0442 \u0438\u043c\u0435\u043d\u043d\u043e \u043d\u0435\u0447\u043e \u0442\u0435\u0440\u043f\u0438\u043b\u0430\u043c\u0438 \u0431\u044b\u0442\u044c", "comment_date": "2020-08-31T10:20:36Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "David Graham", "comment_text": "Thank you for great, heart-felt video.

What do you think happens to someone after they die?<br>2. Do you think there is an afterlife? <br>3. If heaven exists, how do you get there? <br>4. Would you be good enough to get into heaven?<br> <br>Here are a few questions to see if you are a good person: <br> <br>1. How many lies have you told in your whole life? <br>2. Have you ever stolen? <br>3. Have you ever used God&#39;s name in vain?<br>4. Jesus said that &quot;whoever looks at a woman to lust for her has already committed adultery with her in his heart&quot; (Matthew <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YMPzDiraNnA&amp;t=5m28s\">5:28</a>). Have you ever looked with lust? <br>5. If you have broken any of these commandments, would you be innocent or guilty on Judgment Day? <br>6. Would you go to Heaven or Hell?<br> <br>The Bible says that &quot;all liars shall have their part in the lake which burns with fire and brimstone&quot; (Revelation 21:8) and &quot;Those who indulge in sexual sin, or who worship idols, or commit adultery, or are male prostitutes, or practice homosexuality, or are thieves, or greedy people, or drunkards, or are abusive, or cheat people \u2014 none of these will inherit the Kingdom of God&quot; (1 Corinthians 6:9-10). So, if you are guilty of any of the ten commandments, then you are in trouble when Judgment Day comes! Do you know what God did for guilty sinners so that we wouldn&#39;t have to go to Hell? <br> <br>2,000 years ago, God became a human being, Jesus of Nazareth, who suffered and died on the cross for our sins and rose from the dead on the third day, defeating death. The punishment that we deserve for breaking God&#39;s law, Jesus took in our place. He paid the fine that we could never pay so that God can legally set us free by forgiving our sins. He is just, by punishing evil through Jesus\u2019 death on the cross, while being rich in mercy towards us. <br> <br>What you have to do is repent, or confess and forsake your sins, and trust alone in Jesus Christ. Don&#39;t trust your own goodness, because, as Jesus said, \u201cNo one is good \u2014 except God alone\u201d (Mark <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YMPzDiraNnA&amp;t=10m18s\">10:18</a>). Trust alone in the savior. The moment you do that, God will forgive every sin you have ever committed and grant you eternal life, and He will give you a new heart with new desires, so that you will love to do what is right. You will be born again. But you must repent and trust in Jesus. <br> <br>When are you going to do that?<br> <br>Here is a short Christian movie on this subject and depression: <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fcqxzXMRGoc\">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fcqxzXMRGoc</a>", "comment_date": "2020-08-01T12:34:17Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Tim V", "comment_text": "Awesome video!", "comment_date": "2020-08-01T08:29:26Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Larvie Raindough", "comment_text": "<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YMPzDiraNnA&amp;t=5m56s\">5:56</a><br><br><br>Thank You", "comment_date": "2020-08-01T01:37:31Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "\ua9c1 Abraham \ua9c2", "comment_text": "Derek: &#39;&#39;You want to be an academic, You have to get a Phd&quot;<br>freemen Dyson: &quot;Say Sike right now &quot;", "comment_date": "2020-07-31T05:22:26Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Lauritz Scholz", "comment_text": "my dad always says: If you knew what u could do if u wanted to", "comment_date": "2020-07-30T23:36:20Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Yodasoda", "comment_text": "i live in vancouver", "comment_date": "2020-07-29T23:32:05Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "El del lunar \ud83d\udfe3", "comment_text": "learned helplessness is the phenomenon by which dogs stop responding to shocks", "comment_date": "2020-07-29T17:56:57Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "BeautifulPotatoGod", "comment_text": "He looks like my biology teacher.", "comment_date": "2020-07-28T21:55:30Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Hunter Masters", "comment_text": "Nice, thanks for sharing your experience.

I have the mentality that I&#39;ll push myself as much as I can despite low pay, the more competent companies realised that and gave me and increase, also tried to keep me by motivating(by increase) when I wanted to leave but incompetent companies don&#39;t notice this so I just left for a better company. I say that it&#39;s the same with relationships, you have to have experience with different ones, if your company totally sucks despite your trying your hardest (and be honest, are you always trying to optimize things, workout and exercise so you&#39;re in better condition for work, are you trying to find as many mistakes as possible that you can improve on?), your colleagues are trying to drag you down to their level because they don&#39;t want anyone better than them because that&#39;d make thme look bad(like, employer: look, despite minimum wage, this guy works a lot harder than the rest, the rest is lazy) and managers don&#39;t even recognise it? You should find a better one if you want to make more money with the same hours, but maybe the new one will require you to be a very hard worker and not let you take rests whenever you want, so many people just choose to stay where they are instead where it&#39;s more comfortable and become lazier over time because that&#39;s what their pay is enough for, minimum wage-minimum work or high pay-high skill.

The implied message is: &quot;That kid over there got a perfect grade, why can&#39;t you do the same thing?&quot; Of course you also might realize that the task you&#39;re assigned is in fact almost entirely pointless, so you&#39;re torturing yourself if you waste the time to do the task perfectly (because every moment you&#39;re on that pointless task you&#39;re thinking about better things to do with your time), <b>and</b> you&#39;re tortured by the disapproval and other punishments of teachers and parents if you don&#39;t work hard on it and get a bad grade. So <b>no matter what you do</b> you&#39;re tormented by the school system. Just like the dogs who were repeatedly electrocuted.<br><br>Brainwashing prisoners works exactly the same way. Torture them over and over, without reason and without respite, until the mere act of <b>not torturing them</b> seems like amazing mercy and generosity. Then it becomes possible to &quot;reeducate&quot; the prisoner with a new doctrine and explain away the torture as &quot;necessary&quot; to break them from their old ways of thinking. The school system operates the same way, albeit much more slowly. The strict supervision at low grades gives way to more freedom by the time one graduates from college, but the system has still indoctrinated the students into the notion that <b>this is the only way it can be</b> and *the torture is for your own good*.<br><br>The only other organization where the <b>time you spend</b> in the system is what matters, rather than *what you achieve*, is prison. And that other system is also designed to affect the mind (albeit it also does a really bad job of it, since they don&#39;t get to play with the pliable minds of children).<br><br>By the time a child graduates from school, they&#39;re taught that even their private bodily functions like using the toilet, are subject to someone else&#39;s control. That they need to ask permission to do <b>anything</b> because that which is not explicitly mandated is forbidden.<br><br>How convenient for those who really like to control other people!<br><br>Furthermore, the school system is composed of people who <b>liked</b> the authoritarian nature of the system as it was, and returned to it so that they could *make it even more like it was*. This is why what is taught in school lags behind society by half a generation or so.<br><br>One last note. Never conflate school with education.

I personally know one of the 2 people who won the trip, and they had never learned any more japanese than how to count to 99, how to say hello, and that was basically it. If i applied, I would&#39;ve had a roughly 2/7 chance of going to japan all expenses paid, and I missed the opportunity because I thought I was doomed to fail. now, this is a less hidden version of learned helplessness,  but I think it is still relevant.

This has the caveat that I had taught myself PHP and a couple of other programming languages, but had no portfolio to back it up or a degree to prove I knew what I was speaking about. Eventually I said screw it, I&#39;ll apply for any job I think I would want without the experience they are asking for on the job application. After only about 4 weeks, I landed an interview with a company that said if you can come in for a coding interview, we can talk. I went in scared as hell, having no idea what to expect and with an extreme anxiety caused by impostor syndrome, and in the very first test: I finished and showed the lead developer who looked at my code and said... &quot;I didn&#39;t even know that was possible&quot;. I was offered a job that day. I know not everyone can have that experience, but my point is, you have no idea what is possible until you step out on that limb and see if it holds up. You may fall, but damn its worth it. Just TRY, I know its scary and I know there may be rejection, but you&#39;ll never know until you step out and see if that limb holds your weight.", "comment_date": "2019-12-15T22:05:04Z", "likes_count": 2}, {"comment_by": "Reanna", "comment_text": "Wow", "comment_date": "2019-12-15T21:42:19Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Ishan Arya", "comment_text": "This seems like the type of video you would make to pep yourself up in the future.", "comment_date": "2019-12-15T21:36:42Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Sammy Williams", "comment_text": "This inspired me to do my homework.", "comment_date": "2019-12-15T20:49:54Z", "likes_count": 12}, {"comment_by": "David Belen", "comment_text": "Wait dose this mean i can fly.

Now, before somebody claims that I&#39;m just trying to justify being a bad student well, I&#39;m not a bad student. I receive straight A&#39;s. Especially in mathematics. I know that might sound pretentious but math is my best subject and it&#39;s something that I really enjoy doing. The reason I do well in math is not because the subject was taught effectively. They do a better job at teaching math in universoty than they ever did when I was in grade school though. The reason I do well is because as a result of self studying I&#39;ve built a really good mathematical intuition for some of these subjects.<br><br>When I was younger, after we learned basic arithmetic math was taught in a way where it was as if they just wanted the students to mindlessly follow the steps that they were told to do. They were asked to just memorize a bunch of information without really building proper mathematical intuition. That is not the proper way to teach mathematics in my opinion. A lot of teachers would give their students a week to memorize the Unit Circle. But if the teacher explained to the students what a radian is and how half of a rotation around the Unit Circle is equal to \u03c0 radians then the students would see that you don&#39;t really need to memorize very much of anything because you can just work out the rest. Now, of course there are some things that you might have to memorize but the more you learn the less you have to memorize. I hear a lot of people say &quot;I&#39;m just not a math person.&quot; I believe this might be a direct result of how math is taught in some schools. We as humans are very abstract.

A waste of time standing around for the actual bell to ring to walk to the other side of the school in the next 5 minutes for the first period class.<br>Now the school <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YMPzDiraNnA&amp;t=7m35s\">7:35</a> bell was actually set for about <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YMPzDiraNnA&amp;t=7m32s\">7:32</a> or <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YMPzDiraNnA&amp;t=7m33s\">7:33</a>. <br>I had a 25 minute drive to school and would get there almost at <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YMPzDiraNnA&amp;t=7m33s\">7:33</a> everytime. Of course with the bell being early the front doors would lock. The secretary had a window to see who they were about to unlock the door for and would never look up until the bell rang. <br>I&#39;d walk and they would say what is your excuse<br>I didnt have a license so i&#39;d say I have no choice when i get here because I rely on my parents to drive me I get here when they get me here. Of course trying to act professsional the laid off english teacher who somehow became the principal would say ITS My responsibility to make sure I get to school on time. The same principal that had several gramatical errors in my college recommendation letter. Double standard here. Their bell is 2-3 minutes early and 250 highschoolers are supposed to accommodate that as if everyone lives by that schools clock that is unprofessionally maintained and the principal is so anal up until the very second of everyones arrival.<br>And a reminder that class does not start for the next 15 minutes and the teachers also take attendence. <br>The principal would tell her secretary to lie that she was not in if a parent she did not want to deal with called in advance for a meeting or even to talk on the phone. <br>You had to walk in unannounced to speak with her. Even then the secretary lied to my mother saying the principal was not in that day. My mother was angry and said she would wait. They put her in the conference room to speak with someone to take notes on what she had to say. Minutes later the principal peaked in to see what was happening to which my mother replied with <br>&quot;What a pleasant surprise!&quot; &quot;Your secretary didn&#39;t know you were in today, you may want to let her know.&quot; &quot;Now why dont you sit down here so we can have a little chat.&quot;", "comment_date": "2019-06-18T22:16:03Z", "likes_count": 2}, {"comment_by": "Carsy", "comment_text": "Ok I&#39;m going to call NASA again", "comment_date": "2019-06-18T21:34:31Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "MoistBreakfast", "comment_text": "This is vsause on a budget.", "comment_date": "2019-06-18T20:00:15Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Adam Y", "comment_text": "Great video man", "comment_date": "2019-06-18T19:28:08Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Omar Guerra", "comment_text": "This is all on purpose the government wants robots and robots they are creating.

Teslien. The book, \u201cThe Evolutionary Success of Failure\u201d explores the way in which the \u201coptimism bias\u201d (visible in humans and closely related primates) increases costly behaviors and negative outcomes in various population subsets. Despite decreasing the fitness level of the given subset, irrational aspiration and a predisposition toward risk taking increased the likelihood of the population survival through time. <br><br>Goal acquisition generally depends on optimistic outlook and optimism is an evolutionary adaptation which rewards a minuscule subset of aspiring individuals by favoring only a small subset of people who remain willingly ignorant to the odds of their success, despite harboring the potential skill and awareness to accurately calculate the probability of achieving their goal(s).<br><br> Einstein\u2019s introduction ends much as does the book itself\u2014with a surprisingly dark conclusion that runs counter to the typical \u201cfollow your dreams\u201d slogans of positive influencers. <br><br>The conclusion is this: encouraging the young and naive to make irrational attempts at exceedingly unlikely payoffs is a feature of the optimism bias which co evolved in continuity with and by reason of the necessity for this bias to reproduced in subsequent populations/generations. <br><br>Humans are socialized to be optimistic and ignorant and while we think this is good for people to hear, it\u2019s actually quite costly for the majority of individuals as it is irrational. But long term, it increases diversity of attempt, improves theory of mind, problem solving, short term prediction skills and collaborative competition.<br><br>Counter intuitively, role models are essential in reproducing a culture of failure typified by increases in overall incidents of self-identified losses, risk taking and irreversible damage due to trial/error, inasmuch as the increase in the number of irrationally optimistic individuals remains proportional to the increase in population density. <br><br>That is, optimism can be thought of as Mother Nature\u2019s way of getting her children to do the very things she taught us better than...because unlike the mortal human, humanity has (at least up until now) has time on its side and evolution favors diversity and duration over the maximization of benefit over the fixed  lifespans of the individual.", "comment_date": "2019-06-12T08:00:52Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "YoshTG", "comment_text": "some people just never learn to think for themselves, i wonder to what extent im able to think for myself. maybe i just think that i think for myself but in reality im not \ud83e\udd14 hmmm..", "comment_date": "2019-06-12T06:45:46Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "aman jain", "comment_text": "Wow this is really helpful nice work keep going", "comment_date": "2019-06-12T05:15:29Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Subscribe For No Reason", "comment_text": "They gave electric shocks to dogs!<br><br><br><b>John Wick wants to know your location</b>", "comment_date": "2019-06-12T04:33:12Z", "likes_count": 2738}, {"comment_by": "Nefertiti Montoya", "comment_text": "I had no clue he was from north van \ud83d\ude2e", "comment_date": "2019-06-12T04:18:34Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Sbs Nate", "comment_text": "Derek: &quot;They shocked dogs in an experiment.&quot;<br>Me: <b>John Wick mode</b>", "comment_date": "2019-06-12T01:41:15Z", "likes_count": 42}, {"comment_by": "BorisGrishenco", "comment_text": "This video is a Strong motivation to finish my master degree work in three days ;)))", "comment_date": "2019-06-12T01:01:08Z", "likes_count": 49}, {"comment_by": "MetricZero", "comment_text": "By golly I think he cracked the algorithm.", "comment_date": "2019-06-11T21:13:53Z", "likes_count": 765}, {"comment_by": "Leinard Esteves", "comment_text": "I have no idea how youtube found out I\u2019m having issues with my career path but this video really helped me on how to change my mind set.

I don&#39;t think they were dumb (this was an ap class) but they didn&#39;t seem to consider looking the issue up or just debugging it.

Being set up to repeatedly try something you can&#39;t do is actually the way you learn the &quot;learned helplessness&quot;. And the best way to overcome it is by asking for help. <br><br>There&#39;s NOTHING wrong with asking for help. Not trying everything on your own, can and will actually help you accomplish a lot more, a lot faster. It&#39;s a question of how you ask, and whom you ask. Not surprisingly, if you consider it a defeat every-time you ask for help, it will make you unhappy and less productive. Actually one of the most important skills of any successful CEO is ---&gt; delegating. <br>Do the things your good at, the things u have to do, and the things you like ---&gt; delegate the rest. There are some things you might have to do on your own, but usually it&#39;s a lot less then CEOs believe.<br>We may not like it, but there&#39;s pretty solid evidence that most positions aren&#39;t filled with people of the highest competence, but with those who &quot;know somebody&quot; and those who socialize well.<br><br>I&#39;m pretty sure, in the western and asian world, a lot more people get stuck, trying to solve delegatable problems on their own than in &quot;leanred helplessness&quot;. However, the problem is neither their incompetence nor &quot;learned helplessness&quot; but ---&gt;  they&#39;re doing something they don&#39;t really wanna do. They&#39;ve been raised into the typcial western and asian blind-ambition, where the most important thing is &quot;be strong, accomplish things, do something&quot; instead of asking yourself &quot;why am i doing this&quot; or &quot;what do i even wanna do&quot; or &quot;is there somebody else who would be happy to do it for me, to our mutual benefit&quot;?<br><br>Wasting time on a problem that somebody else would be way more competent to solve is actually a form of &quot;learned helplessness&quot;. ---&gt; It&#39;s being stuck in inwardly focused ambition. &quot;I have to prove to myself (and prolly my parents that won&#39;t even see it) that I can do this.&quot; Why do you need to prove it? ---&gt; Because u lack self esteem and waste time and energy on proving things to yourself when others just say &quot;yeah i can do this, but i don&#39;t wan&#39;t to&quot;.<br><br>That&#39;s the reason narcissistic people like Donald Trump can roll over everybody so easily. They&#39;re not smart, they&#39;re not educated --&gt; they&#39;re only real skill is manipulating others, and using they&#39;re ambition and lack of self esteem while having little to no conscience about it. But it&#39;s enough. They don&#39;t care that everybody else is doing the actual work, they just attribute it to themselves anyways, thus never wasting time.<br><br>&quot;divide et impera&quot; - to turn people against each other you need to make them believe that admitting defeat or asking for help is something weak or bad. Yes you prolly can do a lot more then u think ---&gt; the question is does it make sense to do it?", "comment_date": "2018-10-28T11:38:46Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Thomas Ford", "comment_text": "I really want to learn more about that orca statue.", "comment_date": "2018-10-26T20:26:21Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "C.R.

But, because of learned helplessness, I&#39;ve frozen in my tracks in working to mend the fences that I&#39;ve trampled on, in working to tear down the walls that I&#39;ve built between us, in just simply apologizing for my neglectful acts.  This has put a wonderful woman (and our equally wonderful children) through unnecessary pain and hardship, and led to a life of regrets for us all.<br><br>I&#39;ve been blessed with the raw talents and the opportunities to make a good living in a field that I generally enjoy.  But, because of learned helplessness, I&#39;ve fallen prey far too easy to abusive &quot;leaders&quot; who sought to discourage me for their own career benefits, while refusing to accept the honest mentorship of those who only sought to build me up to my potential.  My career is now in a perpetual rut, and because of learned helplessness, I am discouraged from even trying to find a good fit at my age.<br><br>Please, anyone who&#39;s bother to read this far, do NOT give up on your desires to get the things you want.

There are too many adults in the school system who willingly falsify student data, give answers to tests, and otherwise do not hold kids accountable for their own education. If you&#39;re asking why they do this, that&#39;s another can of worms. This is allowing the students to learn helplessness. As long as they know that there will be a way out that is easier than actually doing the work they need to do, what do you think they do? The same thing we all do. We take the easy road most of the time. So these students feign helplessness, and in time even come to believe that they actually are in fact helpless, because they know that at some point a &quot;caring&quot; adult will step in and not allow them to actually fail.  This is incredibly unfortunate, because those of us who are responsible adults understand that for the most part the world outside of school doesn&#39;t work this way.

Her husband had a health issue that killed him like a stroke or heart attack. When he did he drove the car over some rocks and that is when he passed. The woman moved his body out of the way and then tried driving the car off the rocks. She couldn&#39;t get it to move so she resigned herself to dying in the desert. She was only saved by luck as someone happened to be passing by 2 days later. SO the article saying how lucky she was was online on a news outlet. In the article there was a picture of the car, hung up on the rocks. Upon seeing the pic it became clearly apparent that if she had simple got the jack out of the car, jacked the car up and moved some of the rocks to make a ramp, she easily could have lived and drove away on her own. She simply looked at the situation and sai I can&#39;t do this so I guess I will die.<br><br>This story is a perfect example of learned helplessness.

Well I tell you once you&#39;ve been beaten down so hard and so low by everyone you loved and your colleagues, you begin to accept it as your own hell filled truth. Oh my gosh!

So for one of these two professions, I start now to study at university  - but yeah, somehow I could do that in another way without University , but I think the university is at the moment the best way I can think of ( I don&#39;t have to pay anything for the university and even get a free scholarship - no payback needed. ) <br><br>Am I asking for someone else to make this possible for me?", "comment_date": "2017-07-08T18:43:44Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "jenthemusician", "comment_text": "I&#39;m really enjoying the scenery.

I am now 58.  Earlier in my life I was one of those who would make a decision, rather than going to &quot;the boss&quot; for guidance.  All in all it worked out.  I tended to move upward in managerial position; however, I was just as likely to be reprimanded for exceeding my authority.  There is a risk-benefit analysis to do when you take initiative.  For me, when I was single and had few responsibilities and minimal economic needs the risk was small and the rewards probably exceeded the risks.  I&#39;m not sure that most &#39;employees&#39; today could take the same risks.  For Mr. Mueller a 1% chance at $1,000,000 is twice as good as $5,000 in the hand, because losing $5K will not affect him.  He could take that risk; most of us could not.  For most people the risk of losing $5k is far greater than a 1% potential of gaining $1M.  This is the fundamental problem that &quot;successful&quot; (read rich) people can not comprehend.  They see it as &quot;helplessness&quot; or an aversion to risk.

Practically, why would you do the work yourself when there&#39;s a knowledgable person who can already tell you all the answers with less effort on your part? ( I know that, logically, doing it yourself is a much better way of learning in the long-term, but I&#39;m referring to short-term gain).

As the train enters the tunnel, you manage to close both sides of the tunnel by the doors. The train begins to slow down therefore expanding. What would happen?&quot; My question is would the tunnel doors be smashed open? And if so where would the energy come from? Anyone with any possible and rational answers please reply to my comment.

And then you finished it off with Mandela&#39;s quote. Structurally it&#39;s not too dissimilar a problem from your comments about kids in school- both government and schools as institutions were created in a very different world (100/200years ago) from the one we live in, particularly with regard to the focus of the individual, dissemination of information, and social media.  If there was a scientific approach used to research how to reestablish such bodies, their results would probably indicate a suitable system being extremely different to what we see existing now.  Most likely both government systems and schools would become significantly less beuracratic, and more efficient.

The humans could have done worse on test simply because they were annoyed that they had no control, thusly occupying some of their cognitive actions.  <br><br>Employees should ask their supervisor if they are unsure, because often moving forward in an improper direction can lead to loss of money due to time loss or breakage, and adding more wasted time for others down the road.

I don&#39;t want to get too into talking about myself, as I think there are many more people out there with much larger mountains in their path, than I have in mine. But I know me and my situation best.<br><br>I did go to film school. Attracted to it by my first love music (the film department contained all the Audio Production courses). I&#39;ve been out of school since 2000 and have as of yet only had 2 jobs that relate to my degree. One of these jobs was teaching video production to kids in middle school and high school. This job actually made me feel good instead of feeling awful as I do at retail jobs. Anyway the point is, I only got that job because someone I went to school with knew I was looking for work.<br><br>So, to say &quot;no one can help you,&quot; is silly. I didn&#39;t make that job happen through sheer will. It had to be available and I had to know the right person. That&#39;s how the world works, you know the right people and you&#39;re in the right place at the right time.<br><br>I mean you even say, &quot;You have to demonstrate that you can do what you wanna do.&quot; I ask, to whom? To the person or people who can help make that possible. In your case, I&#39;m guessing it was us, the viewers out here in youtube land.<br><br>5. Control is an illusion. No one has any control over anything at all. I think you&#39;re in a lot of trouble if you think you&#39;re the master of your future.

Really what makes the best outcome for everyone is working together, helping each other. Someone helped you, whether you acknowledge this or not. No one does anything in a vacuum (except die), there are always other people involved.<br><br>That&#39;s why I try my best to encourage and help as I can, and why part of the reason I wish for success is all the people I care about that I for whom I could clear some road blocks out of the way.<br><br>7. I think this feels like a response to someone who wanted a leg up from you.<br><br>8. I think humans are smart enough to devise a society where there aren&#39;t roadblocks, where people can pursue there talents. A culture where ones limits are only the ones from within. Sadly, no one wants to work toward that, they all believe that society IS what it is and has been, that it&#39;s immutable.<br><br>Hm.

School was made to teach kids the things they needed to work the factory job of the industrial age.. In a factory your questions and thoughts are meaningless, you simply hafto do the same thing over and over again, until you go home.. The educational system has not changed since then, and still teaches kids to be obediant workers, who dont think for themselves but rather learns to do a task in their sleep.\u00a0<br>For people who know how things work behind the task, or understand how thinks are as they are, but suffer on doing the task or find it boring, school is torment, because the teachers dont know anything besides the content of a book they are quoting. And nothing else than what is expected of answers to a question gives points.\u00a0<br><br>As a programmer, you go to a good programming school, where you learn the basics, like the language and general thought process of making software. but when you are done with the school you know just enough to make a &quot;hello world&quot; website or app, not anywhere near enough to make complex software, games or websites. The rest is up to you.. I learned by making a clone of an old Warlords game from the 90&#39;s. This lead to bigger projects and finally i found a job, where i was confronted with even more challenging tasks, that required me to learn 5 new programming languages and tools to perform daily tasks.. With enough effort i am now a vital part of this company.. But i started out as a novice, after 6 years of programming school and a bathelor degree in computer science.. :) the annoying thing is that a collegue dropped out of school 2 years earlier, never visited a programming school, but instead self learned it all, and he has equal if not slightly better skills than i do..\u00a0<br>School is not worth spending all your life on.. Find out what you love to do, early, find out what minimal school time you need to reach a stage of understanding and &quot;papers&quot; to do what you want to do, and then self experience the rest of the way.. the internet makes this much easier, with the help of veritasium and similar youtube channels that teach things on a &quot;why does it work like this&quot; basis, rather than &quot;To finish this task, do these 5 steps&quot; :)", "comment_date": "2015-04-28T10:11:03Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Lizard Wizard", "comment_text": "<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YMPzDiraNnA&amp;t=5m56s\">5:56</a> your world hasn&#39;t fully loaded yet, that orca is still low res", "comment_date": "2015-04-28T10:09:16Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Gaycob", "comment_text": "I can&#39;t be the only one who clicked because of the lego orca", "comment_date": "2015-04-28T10:07:14Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Gigaheart", "comment_text": "I feel like it does not just stop at schools!", "comment_date": "2015-04-28T10:03:00Z", "likes_count": 4}, {"comment_by": "Rahul Srivastava", "comment_text": "Loved your video mate.

I just wanted to thank you so much for this video! You see I have Learned Helplessness, I just didn&#39;t know it until now. When I was 3 years old I was diagnosed with JRA, or Juvenile Rheumatoid Idiopathic Systemic Arthritis ( I know its a mouthful) At the time there was no direct treatment for my illness, they could only prescribe me Prednisone, also known as Steroids (not the ones that make you buff xD ) because doctors hadn&#39;t created any bio drugs yet for my illness. I was forced to take massive doses of these &quot;Steroids&quot; to keep my illness at bay. But the side-effects were much worse. Not only did I retain water and become super chubby, but the medicine had a hidden side effect, which when taking massive doses like I was, led to you developing Osteoporosis/Necrosis. Basically the veins and capillaries feeding the bones in my joins began to die off, meaning my bones were dieing, and crumbling. My hip ball joint was the first to go, it crumbled and resulted in me becoming wheelchair bound. I was told to do physical therapy to keep my Arthritis at bay during this time, but at that young age of 6 I wasn&#39;t strong enough to push myself past the pain. It ended up that my hips had healed and I was ready to walk again thanks to a new drug just developed called &quot;Enbrel&quot; taking my off the horrid Prednisone. The only problem was after about 3 years of being in a wheelchair, without much physical therapy, my legs and ankles were permanently frozen in a sitting position, and my hands were stuck in almost permanent fists (due to the way I slept at night with my hands closed). Meaning that even though I could now walk, my legs were locked up, not allowing me to. Many doctors over the years have told me that it is irreparable, and I will be stuck in a wheelchair my entire life. (heck, the first doctor that diagnosed me and put me in a wheelchair a few days after my birthday said &quot;Well kid... sell the bike you got for your birthday... you&#39;re never walking again...&quot;) After years of my mother and my family pushing me to try anyway, and actually gaining some progress including assisted walking for a few steps, I gave up. I accepted it as unchangeable, inevitability in my life,\u00a0 I would never be able to walk, to play soccer, to run outside with my little sisters, anything like that ever again. And because of this mentality I have been stuck. With the wheelchair I have needed endless help to do anything, get drinks, go to the bathroom, bath, eat, everything. And due to this I began relying on other people to get me what I needed, and where I wanted to go. For years I have had dreams and aspirations to do great things, but they have gone nowhere due to the way I approached them, I would find someone doing said dream, and beg them to get me in on it, to allow me to skip the work to get there, to pity me and my situation. I am turning 21 in 2 days. I will be a full blown adult, and I have nothing to show for it. No job, no schooling, no home of my own, no girlfriend or fiance like my older sister, nothing. And on top of everything my illness slowed down my aging somewhat, so I look and sound about 12~13 years old. I always told myself &quot;Who would hire (or love) a kid in a wheelchair, who cannot do anything but draw art, can not lift heavy things, can not do anything for himself, and looks and sounds like a child.&quot; But your video has really helped me realise this mindset. I wanted to thank you, because on my 21st birthday I&#39;m going to try again, on everything. I&#39;m going to try therapy, and see if I can walk, I&#39;m going to try and find something I love, and make my way to it without help, I&#39;m going to change my life for the better, without reliance on others to do the heavy lifting for me! Thank you so much for opening my eyes and giving me a second chance. I love your channel and everything you do on it. You are amazing!

I drew diagrams, created logic problems in my head, and began to find an understanding of the universe, but what I didn&#39;t know was that science is a world of proving not listening, and anytime I had an idea of what the world might be, I needed the math or no one would listen, the math that I wouldn&#39;t be able to express with out years of work and effort, even though I understood the grand concepts of it, so I gave up on it. Now I won&#39;t admit I knew exactly how all the laws worked like I was a child prodigy, because if I did, someone here would of probably heard of me and I probably would of kept at it, but all I wanted at that time was someone to help support me, and help me understand and explain my ideas. What I would want now looking back at it, was someone to express to me that I was in control of my own life, and that sometimes all these AP classes that I couldn&#39;t handle wouldn&#39;t be the end of my life if I didn&#39;t take them and didn&#39;t get into a good college, to tell me the path isn&#39;t so ridged and that my life wouldn&#39;t turn to complete waste if I fell off it.\u00a0<br><br>Funny thing though, like you, I taken the route to become a filmer (not a word, but cinematographer sounded like a bit much as a title).

You said yourself that the dogs could indeed be trained out of learned helplessness, even if only very specific methods of treatment worked. But then to advocate that there is no helping people other than them helping themselves out of their own situation is an unfortunately confusing and in-congruent message. (We recognize you yourself are trying to help by making this video.) More likely, an effective method for treating people out of learned helplessness has not yet been understood, but probably worse is to conclude that there is no method, or that because it is a journey everyone must do on their own that no assistance is possible. As with the dogs, we need to find the way to move people out of the shocks, so people can do it for themselves later.<br><br>But to clarify and agree with you insofar, what I mean is not that we should be doing more to help people get into acting or directing school directly, but to help people believe that they can find a way to make their goals reality, rather than not try. There should be a way to help, but this is about helping people more fundamentally with their outlook, rather than their goals directly.

This is essentially the American cultural illusion that if you can only work hard enough, and reach for the stars, you&#39;ll transcend your current situation.

Yes, kids need to know how to read, write and do basic math. But kids also need to learn life skills; we need to train specifically to grow kids initiative and give them more agency in their world. Very often in the classroom, you find that kids shut down when they&#39;re given a challenge, when they&#39;re forced to think. We must resist the urge to simplify, and resist the urge to swoop in and save the day as teachers. Help eventually, but let them struggle through things first.

If we really wanted to change things we could, but it is much more beneficial, especially to the people at the top to have a submissive and helpless workforce that they can exploit. Capitalism is one of the only systems that seems to work well, but it creates such a gap between people that most feel they can never reach the top, so why bother. It is true most will not reach billionaire status, but many more people could do things substantial with their lives. You are doing good work with these videos.
