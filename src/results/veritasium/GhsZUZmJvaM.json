Then they send him to an Island...and the Mambo Jambo theory of evolution was created.<br>- 1955- Operation deep freeze - Richard Byrd return from his excursion to Antarctica and found out that there was more land the size of the USA continent and untouched. Fertil land, without ice.<br>- 1958 - NASA was created - President Eisenhower approves Mind Control Tool. Then they brought in Walt Disney to begin the process of controlling humans with images and stories of fables (Hollywood). And with that the fraudulent US Tax Scam Division.<br>- 1959 - 12 nations create and signed the Antarctica Treaty - followed by 42 more nations. The treaty enforces that no one can explore, visit, or travel to Antarctica. - What do you think they are hiding from us?<br>- All Nasa&#39;s roquets launched from Florida... - they go up, then flatting out and land in the Bermuda triangle, and sometimes they explode them in the air because there are lots of people following the rockets, and it is getting worst for them because we are now following the rockets with dromes, and when they find that out, they have to blow them in the air, with or without people inside. All pictures from NASA are CGIs paid by you... TRILLIONS AND UPON TRILLIONS OF DOLLARS TAKEN FROM YOU, THE TAXPAYERS - THEY CALL US THE &quot;CATTLE&quot;.<br>- All the so-called &quot;satellites&quot; are launched and are flying with helium balloons, attached to them and they consistently crash on someone else&#39;s country. There are no satellites orbiting the earth. IT IS ALL LIES.

Anything you tell them, they will believe.<br>- No other nation spends a cent on inter-planetarium voyages, they know is a lie, and they all know that WE CAN&#39;T GET OUT OF HERE.<br>- BELIEVE IN GOD THE CREATOR ONLY...<br>- IF YOU ADD  A &quot;T&quot; IN BETWEEN THE FIRST AND SECOND SYLLABLES OF THE WORD NASA, YOU will GET - NATSA =  witch is SATAN.<br>- THE HEBREW TRANSLATION FOR NASA =  is TO DECEIVE.<br><br>- The great reset is upon us, it is up to you to wake up and see... or you will be left behind...", "comment_date": "2021-10-26T01:38:45Z", "likes_count": 2}, {"comment_by": "Ys Metero", "comment_text": "Nice.", "comment_date": "2021-10-24T04:09:07Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "M Talha Ihsan", "comment_text": "The Laugh at <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GhsZUZmJvaM&amp;t=2m57s\">2:57</a>", "comment_date": "2021-10-21T12:55:21Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Jed Stefanowicz", "comment_text": "Scientist: We built a wall of 960 computer fans<br><br><b>Corsair has entered the chat</b>", "comment_date": "2021-10-21T02:15:45Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Niklas Diercks", "comment_text": "<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GhsZUZmJvaM&amp;t=2m59s\">2:59</a> What was that??", "comment_date": "2021-10-09T13:09:53Z", "likes_count": 2}, {"comment_by": "Odd-Arne Dahle", "comment_text": "&quot;We keep the batty warm&quot;.

What are some of the future directions that this technology may be taken?

The heating problem seems like an obvious new direction to explore - two thirds of the battery needed for heating seems like a big price to pay. With less battery required one might consider flying a more sophisticated payload (hyperspectral, lidar, or other exotic sensors). A rover with the task of keeping drones warm seems like it belongs in the trade space.<br>2. Even though there is a 20 minute control delay, what are some strategies to overcome this obstacle? Having multiple autonomous flights with each successive flight using information from previous flights seems like one obvious strategy. Having a fully autonomous &quot;explore mode&quot; that attempts to see terrain from multiple angles so that high fidelity 3D reconstruction can be done and used for detailed analyses and successive flights.

It is indeed a very intuitive thing to say that Ingenuity flies in the thin atmosphere of Mars <i>&quot;because its blades spin crazy fast&quot;</i> but the reality is much more subtle.<br><br>The helicopters on Earth spin their blades in a very wide range of rpm, depending on the size of the helicopter -- from below 200 rpm for the large full size helicopters, to 8000 rpm for DJI drones. If we compare Ingenuity to the RC helicopters of equal size, we would see much more similar rpm. RC helicopters with the rotors of the same 1.2 meter diameter as ingenuity (550 or 570 class) spin their blades at 2000-2500 rpm and even faster for some aerobatic flying.<br><br>This does not, of course mean that Ingenuity is just another off-the shelf RC helicopter -- or course it is different in many parameters! But even though it seems counter-intuitive, the rpm is not one of these differences that make it fly on Mars.<br><br>It would be more meaningful to say that the very wide and specialized rotor blades of Ingenuity could lift it on Earth with just 500 rpm (if it had sufficient torque, strength etc).

It must rely on gravity to change direction once it has left the outer layer of earths atmosphere for the most part. So it confounds me how a drone such as this is going to fly up there. There must be enough atmosphere around Mars to allow this. I haven&#39;t followed or studied what is happening out there so I don&#39;t know much other than what I read not long ago about the planet actually having a very thin atmosphere of something. The only way a conventional rocket will function is if there is something for the engine to propel against, such as expanded gases or solid objects, the solid object as in the surface of the Moon during the Lunar missions.

D., Computer and Systems Engineering, Rensselaer, 1985) speaks, he is SO conversant with the topic, the engineering specifics,  the background Science and the planetary characteristics that he never falters, never searches for a word, he just lays out the info bam bam bam. Also, notice, when he was talking about the function of a helicopter&#39;s collective and cyclic, a layman would have said it provides &#39;tilt&#39; ,  BUT which is a RESULT.  <br>Dr. Balaram uses the term &#39;asymmetric torque&#39; , which is what the cyclic actually creates. THIS then CAUSES the helicopter to tilt and thus the &#39;copter experiences lateral movement (result). <br>   I used to tell my students how important accuracy of language was when speaking of technical matters, especially cause/effect situations, and this was an excellent example. Had I not recently retired, I would be sure to use this vid, as I have many other Veritasium vids, in my class. <br>   I also would have pointed out that Project MANAGER  Mimi Aung proves once again that GIRLS CAN DO SCIENCE!! In my classroom, I had a print made of a screenshot from the fantastic (and very moving)  video &quot;Margaret by Moonlight&quot; and a blowup of a photo of her (Margaret Hamilton) standing next to the STACK of software which was written by the team which SHE LED, back in the 60s.

Noise = inefficiency.  Also, it looked like the lower blade profile matched the upper one, this is not optimal, the lower blade needs a bigger leading edge attack angle since it meets a flow established by the upper props.  Also, the blades should have a skewed (curved, non-linear) top view profile which will smooth out vibrations since for a straight blade, the entire length of the lower blade smacks into the primary flow coming off the trailing edge of the upper prop blade (this is the main source of the buzzing noise they heard).  Also, the prop tips need tiplets like you see on airplane wings.  The tiplets significantly reduce the spilling over the tip edge as the high pressure side tries to get to the low pressure side which helps prevent the creation of the vortex coming off the trailing edge of a no-tiplet blade.

Myself, I would not have thought it feasible.<br><br>A quibble: Dr. Balaram mentions a &quot;compactified flow&quot; produced of the tandem arrangement of the upper helicopter blade. This is simply not so. The lower blade is made significantly more efficient in the flow field produced by the upper blade because it &quot;de-swirls&quot; the flow. Lowered pressure induced of velocity increase, induced swirl, and centrifugal force will do just the opposite of &quot;concentrating&quot; it.<br><br>There is a mystery here. If two-thirds of its available power is used for heating, as you say, why were the two motors not integrated into the suspended battery and electronics pack? Dr. Aung&#39;s implied statement that &quot;Aerogel is too heavy&quot; is utterly silly, especially in this context. A cubic decimeter, weighing only 20 g, would have been more than sufficient to serve as insulation to keep in the heat emitted from two operating internally-mounted motors, and combined with preheating from the Perseverance itself, would have allowed <i>all</i> battery power to be dedicated to flight, increasing its flight time by thrice <i>and/or</i> providing a significantly increased margin of safety to account for battery aging. Only 40 Whr seems to be &quot;uncomfortably&quot; minimal when taking into account battery aging and decreased performance when exposed to the harsh ongoing environmental conditions -- both during and between flights.<br><br>There is no redesigning the craft now, but I am doubly curious to know what the engineering rationale is for its current design.<br><br>I sure hope that Perseverance is programmed to store (and deploy) Ingenuity from its <i>base</i> -- just in case Intrepid&#39;s power runs out, it can land, and Perseverance can theoretically travel to it and recover (and recharge) it.<br><br>The above, or else a hook or other grappling mount, that having landed, will allow Perseverance&#39;s arm to easily pick it up. I don&#39;t spot one. Is it actually expected that it <i>necessarily</i> land atop Perseverance to be recovered?<br><br>Is there provision to clean and/or keep clean the aerodynamic surfaces when the inevitable dust storm will coat them in Martian dust? A dirty surface will significantly decrease aerodynamic efficiency, and therefore thrust and/or duration of flight. Electrostatic attraction will not allow mere rotation to blow the dust off completely. A thin coating of Teflon would, I think, not have increased weight unduly....<br><br>I&#39;m having trouble making an educated &quot;guesstimate&quot; of the applicable Reynolds Number. Are you aware that under a certain value, a <i>roughened</i> wing surface is more aerodynamically efficient than a smooth one? Those wings look to have a gloss finish....<br><br>Also, Martian surface radiation was responsible for making effectively inoperative one of the two onboard hardened motherboards aboard Curiosity -- costing a <i>quarter of a million dollars.</i> I sure hope that not only is this rectified on Perseverance, but also on its drone which is &quot;all but unflyable by a human pilot.&quot;<br><br>You know, merely mounting the (two) motherboards about Curiosity/Perseverance vertically, not horizontally, will significantly decrease exposure from solar radiation. Is this indeed applicable?<br><br>Oh, Veritasium: 85kft is the maximum altitude of horizontal, controlled powered flight, but zoom climbs of military jets have easily much exceeded 100kft.", "comment_date": "2020-07-27T19:41:50Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "chlar", "comment_text": "Indians are the best", "comment_date": "2020-07-27T19:38:47Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Gold Fever", "comment_text": "What a scam.", "comment_date": "2020-07-27T19:23:17Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Jay esS", "comment_text": "Lemme guess...

Too much technology and the lack of endurance is what I\u2019m basing my option on.\r<br> I may not be a \u201crocket engineer\u201d but I have worked in the world of mechanical engineering over many, many years.\r<br> NASA\u2019s little helicopter is the size of softball This &quot;marscopter&quot; weighs about four pounds and is fitted with two sets of rotor blades, which can spin at 3000 rotations a minute and as a drone will have to land no matter what batteries or power supplies it has. Yes I did see that NASA/JPL  did  design a rotor blade assembly incorporating the use of photovoltaics The possibility of damage to either rotor blades is of high risk. If the rotor or motor should fail because of the abrasion of fine particulates in the Martian atmosphere it will become immobile. Also there is one more point that makes this impractical is wind. (Gravity still works just as well on Mars as it does on Earth) \r<br>Given that Mars has only 0.7% of atmospheric pressure of the Earth, the rotor blades would be of such a size it would be an impractical design (Most helicopters can fly up to 25000ft at its maximum. A black hawk can fly up to 10000ft. Indian Chetak Helis can fly up to 20000ft but remember your dealing with Earth not Mars.)\r<br>Now I would use an older technology and that is a powered airship. Yes a lighter than aircraft!  It will carry a heaver payload than any helicopter you could ever launch from the surface of Mars. \r<br>If the motor failed on it would not crash and its payload will keep functioning. Although it would be at the mercy of the winds on Mars. (The wind speeds that Viking observed at its site in summer is 2 to 7 m/s (5 to 16 mph) The wind speeds at Viking site in fall is 5 to 10 m/s (11 to 22 mph) and the wind speeds at Viking site in a dust storm 17 to 30 m/s (38 to 67 mph). At higher altitudes, the movement of dust was measured at 250-300 mph. This may sound fast but you have to realize that weather balloons on Earth frequently traverse the jet streams without harm.)\r<br>A lighter than airship can be made buoyant neutral and gather samples from a wide range without difficulty and return to its base following a homing beacon and dock. This base could also be used as a return vehicle and return samples to Earth if needed. The docking station could use an electromagnet on a swivel as to face into any winds when docked It could also use the  photovoltaics on the top of this airship to supplement power at the docking base for running tests on any samples retrieved and download photos or videos for transmission back to Earth.", "comment_date": "2020-07-24T02:07:42Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Gary Ha", "comment_text": "Please don&#39;t let this helicopter die like Spirit did: &quot;... froze to death&quot;", "comment_date": "2020-07-24T00:36:24Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Gary Ha", "comment_text": "Their testing is not testing Mars conditions properly, the fishing line keeps it from tipping, crashing and burning.

The helicopter is a technology demonstration, not an integral part of the mission. However, it could pave the way for future flying endeavors on Mars. The team has already confirmed that the helicopter should be able to fly in the thin Martian atmosphere thanks to its ultra-light design and the planet\u2019s lower gravity.\u00a0<br><br>The last flight test took place\u00a0about a year ago\u00a0(see below), and the helicopter still hasn\u2019t lifted off again \u2014 it\u2019s tuned for the Martian atmosphere, so any flights on Earth require extensive preparation to avoid damaging the machinery. However, the team did conduct one more vital test of the rotors last week in the Payload Hazardous Servicing Facility.\u00a0<br><br>Engineers ran the Mars Helicopter rotors at 50 RPM on a static test stand, which is much slower than they\u2019ll rotate on Mars. The planet\u2019s thin atmosphere means even a light craft like the four-pound helicopter needs a very high rate of rotation to generate lift. The design allows for up to 2,800 revolutions per minute, but it should be able to lift off at around 1,900 RPM. The JPL test confirms the motor is working as intended, and the helicopter is ready to be mounted on the underside of the Perseverance rover.\u00a0<br><br>Despite the ongoing coronavirus pandemic, NASA has worked to keep the Mars 2020 mission on-schedule. Work has stopped on the James Webb Space Telescope for now, but the clock is ticking for the rover. If it doesn\u2019t launch as planned this summer, NASA will have to wait another two years for Earth and Mars to be aligned again.\u00a0<br><br>If all goes as planned, Perseverance will launch July 17 and touch down on Mars in February 2021. It will deploy the helicopter, which has its own solar power system and camera. It will communicate with Perseverance wirelessly via the ZigBee radio protocol. Image data from the helicopter might help Perseverance navigate the challenging terrain of Mars, but future flying drones could be much more integral to exploring Mars.&quot;<br><br><a href=\"https://www.extremetech.com/extreme/308542-nasa-conducts-final-test-on-mars-helicopter-before-launch\">https://www.extremetech.com/extreme/308542-nasa-conducts-final-test-on-mars-helicopter-before-launch</a>", "comment_date": "2020-05-17T17:45:01Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Christian Flateb\u00f8", "comment_text": "Why not a mars blimp instead?", "comment_date": "2020-05-16T15:38:00Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Jan Peterka", "comment_text": "Can someone please explain why it is nessesary to put helicopter on string to simulate low gravity, instead of putting more weight to it?

Being hydrogen filled it would already have a degree of lift and could be powered the same way that i thought of for the ballon, i.e. two fans set in a funnel shaped tube to compress the atmosphere to blow out the back which according to what we have been told about the atmosphere would be enough to propell the unit forward, the climb could be  derived from the usual flying surfaces found on aircraft.<br>All this aside, why did NASA  go for the very first thing considered unsuitable because of the energy required, the idea that light is right seems to be the answer for mars, or that is the way common sense seems to point.", "comment_date": "2020-04-23T17:58:06Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Basement Lab Productions", "comment_text": "I&#39;m astonished that they can fly a drone in 1% of earth&#39;s atmosphere.

Unlike standard propellers that turn at subsonic speeds, the outer 24\u201330 inches (61\u201376 cm) of the blades on the XF-84H&#39;s propeller traveled faster than the speed of sound even at idle thrust, producing a continuous visible sonic boom that radiated laterally from the propellers for hundreds of yards. The shock wave was actually powerful enough to knock a man down; an unfortunate crew chief who was inside a nearby C-47 was severely incapacitated during a 30-minute ground run. Coupled with the already considerable noise from the subsonic aspect of the propeller and the T40&#39;s dual turbine sections, the aircraft was notorious for inducing severe nausea and headaches among ground crews.

For years china has been putting the art of war in full effect.  They owned our government since the 80&#39;s maybe longer.<br><br>They have been slowly studying us after the post take over.  Now they will be our lawyers, judges, police officers, and eventually when they become strong enough politically they will become our leaders.  Which isn&#39;t far away. Every town, or city big or small in the U.S. already has a china town of some sort.  <br><br>They have secret soldiers here in the U.S. too. They study our way of doing business then they relay the information to their country men.  Being that they already control our government,  they use our educational and the legal system to stop us from passing on proper and relevant knowledge of business and marketing to our children.<br><br> They use the legal and educational to create confusion ( racism, LGBT, gender war, immigration, materialism, outdated information, fear and anxiety of what should be normal  like getting a job and running a household) and to pass foolish laws (IRS income tax, minimum wage, rediculous child support payments, gay rights,  metoo, etc, ridiculous fines and detention.) to fleece the pockets of the American people. <br><br>Our nation has become our enemy because the Chinese realize our politicians have a weakness for opioids and money. They pay the important influencers they back, created and support to influence our laws and our policies along with or media. They then use the media and talking points to reinforce and normalize their ridiculous and out blatantly useless and harmful ideologies and enforce their take over agenda through chaos and misery. <br><br>Our past infrastructure and systems before china took over was amazing.  We had room to dream the American dream.  We had one job per household and that was good enough.  Now in a household with 4 people working 3 jobs is barely paying the rent.  George bush went to war with Saddam to bring us wealth and more power but china is the world power now.<br><br> Our IRS Dollars are going towards terrorizing and killing Americans and our dreams.  The GDP increase, we make more millionaires and billionaires and have created hundreds and thousands of new innovations and new jobs yet the country is cutting social and financial support systems more and more along with crucial necessities for survival (housing, food, transportation, food, utilities,  food) are now way more expensive than ever.  Even when things were hand made and materials were difficult to make things weren&#39;t so expensive and stingy.  <br><br>Now with all the new found wealth, technology, innovations, successes and resources weather raw or recycled we have increased poverty and dispear. <br><br>This is serious.  We have become domesticated, spoiled animals going at each other&#39;s throats.  America has changed from a melting pot of people coming together and working with each other to a state a fear and hate for each other.  This is not by accident.   The art of war is real! <br><br>We were once a kind loving prosperous nation.  But because of greed racism and corruption we are becoming a losing nation.  Now Any corporation can buy justice and influence our quality of life buy creating and enforcing wicked policies. <br><br>Our educational system is a joke. Private public, charter schools you pay, pay, pay with no guarantees and might even do more harm or incur major debt.  We go to public schools to learn enough to buy from the Chinese and how to work to make them richer.<br><br>The Chinese educate their off springs with all the knowledge of business, technology and trade. Things the U.S. focused on before the take over.  Then the chines slowly creep into disciplines and markets like a snake coiling around the neck of a sleeping prey.  Then they over take it, strangle it then they consume it. (California, Canal street).<br><br>Our country once made sense.   We had goals we had dreams, now it&#39;s a horror film. One conspiracy, disaster and crap after the next. No rest, no family time nothing that promotes health or life.  Even our foods are artificial and poisonous. <br><br>But through the midst of it all the creators always sends us the answers to our problems before it&#39;s too late. <br><br>The black people in America have a movement for reparations.   We the people has lost control of our government.   We need to come together black and white under one cause and get this money back so we can start taking back our government. <br><br>White people you need to be smart.  The money is not coming from your pockets.  Plus this bailout will be the first time in history the public will benefit from a dispersal of government funds on a whole.  If business are failing in the U.S. it&#39;s because China has attacked our consumer base (locked them up, killed them, financially assassinated them or turn them off of being a great consumer) what we need to do is demand the problem be fixed as a nationt to get the country running again.  If I was a white man with a failing business about to go broke I would more than welcome 20 to 30 consistent steady paying black customers per location than 20 chinese competitors circling like vultures.   <br><br>As a smart white man, a white man that understands business I would understand business 101 with no consumers no business.  So instead of supporting laws and policies that kill my consumers and alienate I would support laws and policies that make them prosper so I can flourish. <br><br>If I was a white man and negros wanted reparations by golly let them have what is owed so we can get what we deserve which is money back in the hands of the American people circulating getting stronger. <br><br>I think with all the brain washing and influences it&#39;s easy to be caught up in the hate machine.  Just don&#39;t cut off your own nose or you children&#39;s legs in the process because things that look sweet today might be sour tomorrow.   <br><br><a href=\"https://store.cdbaby.com/cd/fitzieniceness12\">https://store.cdbaby.com/cd/fitzieniceness12</a><br><br>White people open your eyes. Imagine millions of black people with free money lined up to spend money at your business. <br>I repeat. Let&#39;s sit back and vision together, 800,000,000 black people with free money, reparations money, any money lined up in front of your business.  <br>Just think about it.  Less need to spend money or time on marketing and promoting.  Less hassles in life.  Not having to worry much about crime, or your place of employment being robbed because there just isn&#39;t enough money or opportunities to make money.

It&#39;s not scalable.  Again, using the materials we have available today, if you want a longer flight, you need more battery charge capacity.  In order to have the same vehicle fly for 3 minutes, you would need twice the batteries.  Twice the batteries means twice the weight and twice the interior volume of the fuselage.  More weight equals more disk surface (longer rotor blades).  Basically, the usable payload will remain what it is for the smaller craft.  Or am I missing something?

While I&#39;m all for a demonstration of flight on mars as a mental flex, I do think that a rover that actually moves with actual instruments can be the superior explorer. If able to move at 10-15km/h autonomously and fast sensors able to scratch the dirt and do instant composition, you can explore vast distances on mars over a year or two. In the first afternoon it will vastly eclipse the pathetic rovers that came before and over a year it could reasonably cover all near surface aspects of mars. A decently engineered rover could also have the capability for the occasional 2 meter drilling into the ground.
