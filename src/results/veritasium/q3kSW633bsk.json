to notice that\r<br>institutionally science is\r<br>indoctrination\r<br>pretty much like religion\r<br>children are in fact this is a factual\r<br>statement children are in fact\r<br>indoctrinated into science for 12 years\r<br>and then even\r<br>more if they go to universit\r<br>why do i say indoctrinated is this a\r<br>slur no this is an accurate factual\r<br>statement\r<br>because in fact\r<br>children are not taught epistemology or\r<br>metaphysics or alternative worldviews or\r<br>alternative methodologies\r<br>in school\r<br>for the first 12 years that they&#39;re\r<br>growing up they&#39;re not taught this at\r<br>all they&#39;re not taught philosophy\r<br>they&#39;re not taught different ways of\r<br>looking at the world\r<br>none of these none of these things are\r<br>ever mentioned science is learned by\r<br>children through brute wrote\r<br>memorization\r<br>do you remember science tests chemistry\r<br>biology physics\r<br>whatever other science you took all of\r<br>it was just blind memorization you\r<br>didn&#39;t derive a single biological fact\r<br>you didn&#39;t drive a single physical fact\r<br>you didn&#39;t derive a single chemical fact\r<br>and even those few uh [ __ ]\r<br>experiments that your\r<br>chemistry teacher might have forced you\r<br>to do\r<br>while you were just you know probably\r<br>laughing with your friends and and\r<br>[ __ ] around you you were just like\r<br>writing numbers down you know making\r<br>numbers out of your ass while you&#39;re\r<br>doing the doing those experiments you\r<br>weren&#39;t actually thinking about anything\r<br>while you were doing those experiments\r<br>you didn&#39;t actually do any real science\r<br>there you didn&#39;t actually validate\r<br>anything or invalidate anything you\r<br>didn&#39;t test anything you were just\r<br>following instructions even when the\r<br>chemistry teacher told you to do the\r<br>experiment he or she gave you a list of\r<br>steps to follow an exact method and you\r<br>just followed it like a blind [ __ ]\r<br>monkey that&#39;s what you did and you\r<br>generated exactly the kind of results\r<br>that he wanted you to generate\r<br>you weren&#39;t seriously testing anything\r<br>so\r<br>truly you were indoctrinated into\r<br>science exactly like a muslim is\r<br>indoctrinated into islam in a islamic\r<br>madrasa\r<br>religious school\r<br>you know they will beat muslim children\r<br>with sticks in madrasas\r<br>forcing them to memorize the quran word\r<br>for word the entire [ __ ] quran\r<br>well that&#39;s essentially what happened to\r<br>you\r<br>in the west\r<br>when you were learning science in school\r<br>they did this to you for 12 years and\r<br>you don&#39;t even know that they did this\r<br>to you you just assumed that this is how\r<br>it is and you took it for reality this\r<br>is highly significant you might say leo\r<br>but why does this matter this is not\r<br>important\r<br>isn&#39;t education good\r<br>it&#39;s highly significant to the point\r<br>that i&#39;m making because your first 12\r<br>years of development you know from age 6\r<br>to let&#39;s say\r<br>18 these are the most formative years of\r<br>your mind your entire sense-making\r<br>apparatus of your ego mind is formed\r<br>during this time if you give me 12 years\r<br>to indoctrinate a child into anything i\r<br>want i can make that child believe\r<br>anything for the rest of his life\r<br>he&#39;ll believe that it&#39;s real and true\r<br>this is imprinting of the mind\r<br>do not underestimate the significance of\r<br>this indoctrination it&#39;s\r<br>it&#39;s\r<br>utterly radically profound\r<br>your entire world you are shaped by this\r<br>you are virtually incapable of thinking\r<br>outside of this worldview you were\r<br>indoctrinated with materialism\r<br>realism\r<br>objectivism\r<br>uh rationalism\r<br>skepticism whatever else\r<br>other isms\r<br>and you&#39;re not smart enough to think\r<br>outside of this\r<br>this is the operating system that you\r<br>are now using to make sense of the\r<br>things that i&#39;m telling you every word\r<br>coming out of my mouth is being run\r<br>through that operating system and being\r<br>corrupted by all of the faulty\r<br>assumptions metaphysical and epistemic\r<br>and mythological within that system that\r<br>you were indoctrinated with that you\r<br>never questioned\r<br>and if you don&#39;t think that&#39;s a\r<br>significant problem\r<br>you&#39;re kidding yourself\r<br>as you were learning science you have\r<br>never ever validated the scientific\r<br>method itself you never\r<br>it never even crossed your mind to test\r<br>it\r<br>never\r<br>never\r<br>and as you went to university it never\r<br>even crossed your mind to test it\r<br>because you were too busy cramming for\r<br>tests\r<br>drinking beer with your buddies smoking\r<br>weed\r<br>going to parties\r<br>and just barely struggling to maintain\r<br>your grades\r<br>that&#39;s what you were doing\r<br>you weren&#39;t doing a serious\r<br>investigation of anything\r<br>true or real\r<br>you never gave a [ __ ] about reality or\r<br>truth ever in your entire educational\r<br>career\r<br>it was all\r<br>memorization and belief and of course now you have to hope it was all true because as soon as you start to realize that some of it wasn&#39;t true. <br>well that\r<br>sows little seeds of doubt which\r<br>are going to grow and grow and grow\r<br>until the whole thing collapses.\r<br>see if you allow me i can easily design\r<br>a school curriculum that will teach students false science.\r<br>i can invent a systemequivalent to science which is completely false and i can teach it to children for 12 years and they will become so convinced of it.\r<br>by the end of those 12 years that they\r<br>will be utterly irredeemable for the\r<br>rest of their lives. the majority of them\r<br>you will never be able to convince them\r<br>of an alternative system\r<br>that&#39;s the power of imprinting\r<br>on a young mind and guess what.\r<br>it&#39;s happened to you.\r<br>see all this time you were laughing\r<br>thinking it happened to somebody else to those crazy religious people to those\r<br>mormons to those scientologists to those\r<br>muslims to those evangelicals.\r<br>it happened to you.\r<br>it just happened in a scientific way.\r<br>that doesn&#39;t mean it&#39;s true.\r<br>that&#39;s just an alternative worldview.", "comment_date": "2022-01-13T00:20:55Z", "likes_count": 0},

I request all people of Indian origin to to unite and form a committee comprising of senior academics and engineers that can challenge Indian govt&#39;s policies on technical education. Since they are outside observers backed by top institutions, they can bring a change in a country that will always be theirs. Rote learning methodology must be abolished for a methodology that drives innovation. India lacks natural resources and instead of begging western countries for technology transfer with intellectual property rights, we have to develop technology ourselves. I hope Indian engineers and scientists that study in the top institutions prefer to stay in their respective industries instead of being swayed by big money management jobs abroad. Russia is the best example of how to do this. Even after so many sanctions by western block, they are still neck to neck if not ahead in all fields of technology.

Period- the reason is that the it can only help people with myopia or presbyopia and not people with astigmatism which is actually very common and I\u2019m not even talking about other complex cases (only regarding the curvature of the cornea or defects with the lenses) like Keratoconus. Not to mention we already a have a machine like this called AutoRef which I use widely. Finally, a professional is definitely required for and is other data like intra ocular pressure, disc, retina check etc before we come to any conclusions.<br>The second one: swear to god I  was actually impressed and I wanted her to win. She used a simple formula formula and a simple graph. I studied that in 10th grade but her research was amazing and she was really confident during the interview. I felt like she had a goal and was keen to learn more.<br>The third one: again a good project but I\u2019d rather say that a good chemical analysis should be done by professionals in case of natural water bodies and since most of the people drink RO water these days, it\u2019d be a futile product however that is indeed a good instrument for basic analysis and research or fo countries where people drink water directly from the natural source (idk why there\u2019d be As in a natural water body that I secluded).

Unfortunately, that sort of thing permeates the field and causes a lot of bright students who could come up with revolutionary ideas to never be able to apply any of them because they simply don&#39;t have the funding to explore their ideas fully. And a lot of highly scientific minds don&#39;t have the best social skills to &#39;network&#39; and match up with those who do have the means, or the boldness to push their concepts out to teachers and events such as this (after all, haven&#39;t many of us grown up in schools where showing too much abnormal intelligence results in bullying, or outright beatings by the dumber kids?). I&#39;m always depressed to understand how many people grow up with knowledge and ideas that could revolutionize the world, but that live and die in obscurity for various reasons. For every one that overcomes severe adversity, there are probably a hundred who aren&#39;t able to. But there is no way to uniformly identify all children with potential and properly nurture them all, so it often is a crap shoot as to which kids really make it. <br>As for who i expected, i really thought it was the kid who developed the eye test. When i went to an optometrist last year, he said they had purchased an entirely new machine and it made their lives so much easier, and i noticed it wasn&#39;t the same multi-lens system as usual-so this kid probably got a patent and has made a fortune off of it.

I am sure that there is an industrial production of stuff like she suggests and people that produce it know what they are doing much better than this girl. Also, it is not clear what is here contribution to the final product. She wrote a program that identifies the color from the camera?<br><br>So,  I am voting for the first guy.<br><br>PS: In any case, it is clear, that all three had substantial support from senior people: they were explained what to do and taught what to say. This is not how a good scientist, independent by definition, should work. To me it is more of a freak show, for children of parents with failed ambitions. <br><br>PPS: Having watched the video and finding out what was the choice of the referees, I watched the presentation of Ana once again. As I understand, the point is as follows. Assume, we observed two planets with known masses and radii of orbiting (I am not sure that one can get this info by measuring a dip in brightness). Then, the question is: what are the radius of the orbit and the mass of the planet that one can put in between the observed two planets without destroying stability of their orbits. My main problem is that I do not understand where the plot on <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q3kSW633bsk&amp;t=5m25s\">5:25</a> comes from. I assume, this is a previously obtained result. In any case, I do not see how it can be obtained knowing only the school physics. It requires good understanding of how the four-body physics works. Only two-body systems can be solved analytically and many of high school seniors are struggling to understand even this simple problem. Four-body systems can be either simulated on computers, or one can use some sort of perturbation theory analytically to get approximate results. In any case, this is far beyond what students know how to do in school. So, I am wondering, what is the actual Ana&#39;s contribution. Speaking of utility (and omitting the fact that observations of dips, most likely, are not sufficient to identify masses and radii of orbits), possibility of presence of additional planets does not imply that they are, indeed, present there. <br><br>I also looked up the web and found stuff like &quot;Ana Humphrey created her first environmental education project at age ten after learning how mountaintop removal coal mining devastated mountain ecosystems and community health&quot;. Does anyone really take this crap seriously? And 250 000 is the quarter of the Nobel price, btw, for which serious people are working their asses off the whole life.

The way she tested her program was to use public data bases on the locations of space junk, take a few of the objects in the data base, and using her AI, see how many objects it could predict that also happened to be in the data base.

Here I look for unpacked spaces in Kepler multi-candidate systems that should, according to a PPS corollary, contain planets. In doing so, a &quot;roadmap&quot; was created to find potential unidentified planets. Previous research suggests that a system&#39;s dynamical packing can be quantified using the dynamical spacing \u0394: the number of mutual Hill radii between adjacent planets (a &quot;planet pair&quot;). Using previously proposed values for minimum \u0394 (10, 12.3, and 21.7) required for planet pair orbital stability, I determine whether planet pairs in Kepler multi-candidate systems could host an intermediate body (an &quot;unpacked pair&quot;). For each Kepler unpacked pair, the maximum mass of an intermediate body that the pair could host while remaining in stable orbits (&quot;mass capacity&quot;) and the semimajor axis at which this mass could be hosted were calculated. Next, the probable masses were determined. Known packed planet triplets were surveyed to determine the mass capacity each middle planet uses. It was found that 95% of middle planets have a semimajor axis that fall within a 12.45% semimajor axis deviation of the ideal semimajor axis. Furthermore, the results suggest that Kepler multicandidate systems have space for as many as 559 unidentified intermediate planets assuming a minimum \u0394 = 12.3. Median mass efficiencies suggest that of these planets exist, 28% could be Earth or Super Earth-sized. If the unpacked pairs are due to missing planets as suggested by PPS, the predicted mass and semimajor axis for these potential planets may facilitate detection by characterizing expected transit and radial velocity signals. However, the large number of unpacked pairs might also be explained by variations of PPS (for example, systems that start packed and become unstable over time) or alternate system architecture hypotheses.", "comment_date": "2019-04-20T02:21:43Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Infernal Chainsaw Puppy", "comment_text": "And I&#39;m just sitting here watching the video, wondering what tf these geniuses are saying.

The problem is you can&#39;t force someone with no friends to make friends because I didn&#39;t have no friends by choice and all the lectures and beatings in the world aren&#39;t going to make people like me all the sudden. so doing homework was naturally discouraged in fact if I was at my house I was only allowed to do exactly what my parents said and nothing else which usually entailed normal chores cleaning laundry raking the yard cutting grass etc I was not allowed to argue so if I wanted to do homework I would have to do it at night when I was allowed to go to bed. now if I were like my brother and sister the easy solution was to not come home and just hang out at friends houses until night time and on weekends. but when even they were at home they could do whatever they wanted (they still had to work but not nearly as much) partly because my parents were way more used to ordering me around so when they wanted something done they naturally just told me to do it and partly because they considered it punishment or as they called it &quot;incentive&quot; to make friends. so that meant if I wanted to make good grades I would have to stay up at night every night and do it. it was like having a full-time job on top of 8 hours a day 5 days a week of school. so I just didn&#39;t do the homework. my teachers didn&#39;t care and the school system down here is set up to pass even the stupidest of kids. tests were worth only 40% of the total grade and the exam wasn&#39;t a percentage of the whole grade just 30% of the testing average so even though got an A on every test I was still barely passing (even the stupidest person could copy the homework from their friends and pass) all my classes. so even though I was the only person ever at my high school to make a 5 on an ap exam (i got a 5 on the ap physics exam and also the ap chemistry) I ended up with a 2.2 weighted GPA 1.9 unweighted. So now I am 19 and I can&#39;t get in any decent colleges so my only real option was to accept the insurance adjusting job from my dad. so now I just hate my life and still have no friends and I just want more than anything to go to a good college where I can meet people like me who actually enjoy theoretical physics and higher math. life just isn&#39;t fair", "comment_date": "2019-04-19T17:51:25Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "experience", "comment_text": "Out of these three project, the water testing or eyesight measuring device could have much bigger immediate impact.
