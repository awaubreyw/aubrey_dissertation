Has the user put effort in and reinforces correct responses.<br><br>I don&#39;t really think the assumption Khan Academy&#39;s audience is the same as a random population is beneficial.  Not to mention conceptual understanding versus a computational understanding both have their advantages.  If you were to just graze over Khan Academy&#39;s videos to gain a conceptual understanding, or maybe just other YT videos, I think there&#39;s a good chance that that bias effect you describe sticks around.  But I think it&#39;d have different results when you teach people how, why, and when to quantify something and compute something. <br><br>In the end of the day, you should have both tools under your belt, computation and conceptual.  Without computation it is easy to make quick judgements, bad assumptions, and have biases.  Without conceptual it&#39;s easy to be loss on the how, why, and motivation behind a computation, you&#39;re effectively an actual computer (surprise).  But with both you have the ability to understand why you achieve a result, and assert and verify that that result is correct.  <del>Insert some sponsorship about Brilliance here</del>", "comment_date": "2021-04-23T22:19:43Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Priyadarshini Prasad", "comment_text": "Absolutely amazing video Derek.

It seems to me that there is an issue with the way people teach themselves something. For electromagnetism for example, I&#39;ll be reading 2-3 pages on the subject and slowly taking notes, disregarding anything I previously knew. This helps because it can override ignorant information that was previously known as my working knowledge in the subject. Then again I&#39;ve been teaching myself since 3rd grade so it isn&#39;t difficult for me. I don&#39;t know if anyone can do this day one but it is interesting to analyse conceptually. I can completely blank my mind and create a brand new infrastructure when learning something. If I know something properly, it shows, as I will be not only getting better grades, I&#39;m more confident generally, but I also do all the notes in a day, this allows me to learn more topics per week and achieve faster.

Another is the discovery that the cell&#39;s structural design is not generated by genetic information, but is instead passed on by reproduction form the reproductive cells of the parents (Cortical Inheritance) which traces back to the original created organism. Evolutionism is a philosophy which is contradicted by science. Over 100 yrs ago, Evolution Theory was plausible for naturalists because of their rejection of God. Biological science was rudimentary and archaic, and provided no information about the operations of the cell. Modern biology has very greatly changed what is known of genetics and biology. It has been discovered that life is based upon information which is digitally encoded and stored in a more compressed form than man&#39;s best computer compression schemes.<br><br>Evolutionism arose from a rejection of Christian values in the 18th century, leading to a rise in secular humanism which required a materialistic explanation for man&#39;s existance free of God. This rise in humanism was fueled by a lack of adequate effort of Christians to defend the truth against new false ideas that were nothing more than replacements for one truth or another, as well as the outsourcing academic and scientific control to those who are non-believers. Rejection of truths for imaginary ideas has caused many to fall into believing that philosophical ideas from the secular world are scientific because secular men of science said it was so. Today the tables are turning, and there is increasing support in both the scientific community and the general public for Special Creation and Intelligent Design among scientists of all fields. The threat is so great to secular control over academia that secular scientists are resorting more than ever to harsh treatment of evolution doubters or disbelievers of evolutionism. The priests of evolutionism are now typically afraid to debate the subject of evolution and creation on college campuses because of the history of them being so clearly refuted in such debates, and so now they severely fear being refuted in front of their own students and the media.<br><br>DNA is a material medium encoded with information which is organized to conform to linguistics, possesses algorithmic information processing operations, and the human language properties of phonetics, semantics, punctuation, syntax, grammar, and aprobatics. The information input and output processing of DNA includes the analytical operations of proofreading, information comparison, cut, insert, copy-and-past, backup, and restore, all of which operate by algorithmic operations. There is no potential for the material actions of chemistry to produce information, algorithms, and linguistics. They are non-physical fundamental entities that can only be produced by intelligence. This fact is proof that all life was designed by a mind of supreme intelligence. Because of this and many other biological discoveries, it has been overwhelmingly demonstrated that evolution is impossible and creation is a scientific fact.<br><br>DNA is a 4-dimentional (3 dimentions + time) operating system which is far more complex than man&#39;s computer software technology, posessing many thousands of information hierarchies and pathways in the cell. When the DNA molecule is supercoiled as chromatin, some of it&#39;s information is available to the cell which is not available when the molecule is uncoiled, and when it is not supercoiled, some of it&#39;s information is available to the cell which is not available when it is supercoiled. DNA is a dual-directional information package, providing different information depending upon which strand and direction the transcription machinery of the cell is traveling. Man does not know how to to write computer software that can be read both forward and backwards to provide separate information processes and functionality. It is beyond our ability. DNA&#39;s individual information sequences are overlapping and nested sharing nucleotides between sequences, and information in different locations of the molecule are interdependent with each other, even when separated by hundreds or thousands of base pairs in distance from each other - a feature which exemplifies why chemical processes cannot design DNA.<br><br>DNA possesses codes built upon codes which regulate the use of each other, even when they are distant from each other in the molecule. Genetic algorithms and information possess forward-thinking properties, which nature is incapable of producing because molecules are not sentient. During an organism&#39;s development, the genetic information instructs the cell on how to turn on and off, like chemical switches, many sequences of information of the DNA in a supremely complex and yet to be understood orchestral arrangement of various groupings and orders so as to build the structures of the organism over time. These patterns of genes being switched on and off is so complex that man will likely never be able to decipher it.<br><br>If you want to believe in evolution because you refuse to acknowledge the existence of our creator, nobody can stop you. But doing so is to be a denialists of the discoveries of modern science because the truth is uncomfortable, and to continue to believe things which the outdated concept of Charles Darwin over 150 yrs ago could not have predicted. Believing in evolution today is as antiquated as it was to believe that flies arose from meat, or that frogs arose from mud a century prior to Darwin. <br><br>Eugenie Scott, the popular militant defender of evolutionism has stated, &quot;If your local campus Christian fellowship asks you to &quot;defend evolution,&quot; please decline. Public debates rarely change many minds; creationists stage them mainly in the hope of drawing large sympathetic audiences. Have you ever watched the Harlem Globetrotters play the Washington Federals? The Federals get off some good shots, but who remembers them? The purpose of the game is to see the Globetrotters beat the other team. And you probably will get beaten.&quot;<br><br>Atheists in fact hate the Scientific Method and refuse to employ it. Example: 100 years of random genetic mutation experimentation, over one million studies, has provided consistent results demonstrating that random mutations are destructive and negative to organisms, both biochemically and anatomically, and do not add anything useful to the physiology of any organism, not even incrementally. Conclusion? Mutation cannot be a mechanism for accruing change that results in macroevolution. But what does the atheist conclude despite such a massive body of evidence? They continue believing that random mutation IS a mechanism for accruing change that results in mind-bending complexity, microscopic interdependent machinery, and macroevolution, not because of science, but because their worldview requires it to be, since if evolution were true, random mutation would have to be the base mechanism for evolution because genetic information defines organisms. In this way, they refuse to come to the correct conclusion because of their paradigm, tossing out the Scientific Method and the conclusion it would require them to accept.<br><br>Examples of how atheists refuse to comply with the Scientific Method are nearly countless, and found in all fields of science. I would say that based upon this fact, atheists are incapable of being objective, responsible scientists in any field which relates to the universe, organic life, or history. Atheists should be kept away from academia of any field like small children should be kept away from matches.<br><br>Anthony Flew, once the word&#39;s foremost atheist academic who&#39;s former arguments are some of the posters upheld by atheists to this day, converted to a theist and creationist because of the biological evidence.

I have two objections, though.<br><br>1. You essentially warn that too smooth an explanation in a ten-minute educational video does not constitute a sufficient intelectual stimulation hence it does not lead to deep learning. The correct explanation being consumed passively by students often fails to help them identify their misconceptions and, as a result, unjustified self-confidence is developed instead of solid understanding. That&#39;s roughly what you say, correct? These objections are perfectly legitimate but I am just wondering why do you aim this criticism just at Khan Academy videos or educational videos in general? Are not these objections valid for a classical lecture given by a teacher standing in front of a few dozen students, giving a story while drawing diagrams and equations on a black board (or worse, running computer presentation)? Both traditioal lecture and video-lecture can suffer from the deficiency you describe, can&#39;t they? Both have tools to minimize the danger of a student falling into this trap. Instead, you present it as a weakness/threat special just to educational videos.<br><br>2. It appears to me that the particular trap you describe is mainly relevant for teaching subjects in which the students already have some apriori knowledge or at least an intuition. Physics and in particular mechanics from which you choose your example is a primary instance. Almost everybody is ready to argue fiercely about their views of centrifugal force they KNOW WELL from Merry-go-round (the more so if they are not aware it is actually a fictitious force). But how about subjects/courses in which students encouter some material/concepts/ideas for the very first time? Sticking to physics in the primary/elementary education, my personal experience is that the kids/students have hardly any idea about electric charge, current, voltage and relations among them before they encouter it at school (besides the vague awareness of existence of something called electricity). But if electricity is not a convincing example, consider whichever even less popular &amp; intuitive topic. Introducing the notations, definitions and basic principles to students through a short video just in order to save time in the real/physical class for experiments, examples, questions &amp; answers makes perfect sense then. Watching videos is certainly not intended as the only component of learning, not even according to Khan.

The video afterwards with the Australian lady is even more confusing because she says &quot; now consider a case the gravitional force is the only force acting on an object&quot;; based on what I know if that were the case the ball would never leave his hand unless to roll off and fall to the ground. Gravity does not cause balls to fly upwards. So that brings me back to what I was initially thinking. Like why is the ball going up if no force other than gravity is acting on it? is it inertia? so the initial force isn&#39;t being applied, but that force is still the cause for it&#39;s upward flight path. Technically the initially force is not &quot;acting on&quot; the ball...but it&#39;s really not surprising that anyone would get that question wrong.

They&#39;re doing it for academic purposes which forces them to either understand the lessons or fail the exercises and go back to rewatch the videos to understand where they went wrong. <br><br>More over, while watching Khan Academy videos, you&#39;re encouraged to do the lesson examples before you proceed into the lesson, which is when you&#39;re exposed to your own misconceptions. You will then compare both the procedure and the answer with Khan. <br><br>Also, Khan very commonly starts a new concept that you might have a misconception in with &quot;well, at first you might think... Or otherwise try this... But as we can see...&quot;. How is that different to you going around in the streets asking people what they think.

Sometimes attitude matters more than any of the factors.<br><br>And there is another thing. When teaching younger students clarity must be there. My mom told me a story about one of her science faculty professors back in the &#39;90s writing almost unreadable notes on the board. My mother and other students were actually practicing to be teachers, so naturally one of the students asked the professor how he dares teach them to teach with such unreadable notes. The professor&#39;s reply was almost the same you mention here in this video about clarity and stuff. So mostly not being clear crushes pre-ideas of mature students, <i>not inexperienced immature students</i> as per that professor. <br><br>So my idea is the method of teaching depends on many other factors. The traditional methods still work in places like Japan where discipline is highly admired. More unconventional methods will be needed for countries where freedom is admired most. Even your kind of videos may come to a place where they may be no longer inspiring for some. Some may watch your videos just for the sake of watching and may get nothing at all. One may attract to the fact of being wrong rather than figuring out where they were wrong and why. <br><br>In Sinhalese, there&#39;s a saying, &quot;whatever they say just listen carefully.&quot; (\u0d9a\u0dd2\u0dba\u0db1\u0dca\u0db1\u0dcf \u0d9a\u0dd9\u0dc3\u0dda \u0d9a\u0dd3\u0dc0\u0dad\u0dca \u0d85\u0dc3\u0db1\u0dca\u0db1\u0dcf \u0dc3\u0dd2\u0dc4\u0dd2\u0db6\u0dd4\u0daf\u0dca\u0db0\u0dd2\u0dba\u0dd9\u0db1\u0dca \u0d87\u0dc3\u0dd2\u0dba \u0dba\u0dd4\u0dad\u0dd4\u0dba.)

If the video is in disagreement with older technology, why is the video in disagreement. I do not want to hear that a lot of colleges say so. I want to here why the person doing the video feels that it is so. Over ninety eight percent of the videos today about science, progress wrong basics, using very cool experiments but with wrong explanations. <br><br>The people that are doing the videos are too emotional, they are obviously not sure of themselves. It seems like they are just trying to get through the video and sell their point rather then bring hard basics, that unlock the universe. Science is not so emotional, it is a horrid task of facing battlefields created by poor science. <br><br>Misunderstandings in science the only language, the only way to communicate and prove truth, is corrupt at a basic level. That is a murderous act. But we are going to somehow make a fun video and get people interested, interested in what? Confusion. <br><br>If we had been taught marshmallows were what matter is made from, and we believed it completely. Then you were to make a video demonstrating the making and detonating of an atomic bomb, how silly would that video be? As you explained the tiny marshmallows toasting and swelling up causing the blast? What do you think people that really understand the universe see when we watch these current videos? I love to see the experiments but the underlying principles are not there. It is almost totally irresponsible.<br><br>I am always clear that Benjamin Franklin is the founder of science on earth. Only his courage and commitment allowed him to voice what other men had found, but were to afraid to state as truth. He had to create a country to talk about science. My only goal is to see everyman on earth have the courage to demand truth. <br><br>Because not many others were willing to stand up for science, Benjamin Franklin&#39;s work was corrupted. We no longer learn the basics found almost 300 years ago. Was he the only one that could face real science?<br><br>Today because the foundation of science is incorrect no video about science can do much but open a can of worms. So most people are not quick to get caught by what seems like an interesting or authoritative video without full disclosure of the state of science. So you have a bunch of kids just making comments with no purpose other than to get attention in a sea of failed science. The class clown will win against poor science. Because poor science needs to be axed out of existence, or buried alive. <br><br>We have seen time travel come and go, the speed of light constant not so constant, forces of attraction disappear along with the neutron that relied upon them. Things that are very dangerous not properly labeled and handled, so we know there are problems with the basics. If the video does not address these points it is just some dorky guy trying to make a name for himself rather than tackling the real problems of life, which might be overcrowding, in need of a real space program. A real space program which we already have the technology for. If we could highlight the incorrect basics that are being taught as real basics. <br><br>Do people even know that an electrical differential is created when there is a high pressure differential created through a Venturi and discharged. This electrical power can be harvested and used to power a plasma system that creates the pressure differential. So we can go anywhere very quickly if we cared to. <br><br>Most people do not know that the reason scientists, and businessmen in the fifties and sixties could not go into space on their own. Was because there were discrepancies in the substances that men inhaled and exhaled to sustain life. So you could not with a good conscious just send men into space, while weighty books told of their doom. Yet by actual experiment what caused men to live in die was incorrectly recorded in those books. That is what helped stop men from just going into space.  There were outrageous battles against ignorance that young people just do not know about. Unfortunately people are slow to stand for anything, having no real science to base their actions on. <br><br><br><br>Sincerely, <br><br>William McCormick", "comment_date": "2017-03-03T02:56:41Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Renan Alves", "comment_text": "It\u00b4s verry cool when the guy realize that tha earth doesnt take a day to revolve around the sun!!!", "comment_date": "2017-03-02T06:36:35Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Saketh Saravu", "comment_text": "Derek. fantastic as usual.", "comment_date": "2017-03-01T21:06:47Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Luis Brudna", "comment_text": "Sometimes I am afraid to learn the misconceptions.", "comment_date": "2017-02-13T18:45:48Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "HECKproductions", "comment_text": "i believe that knowing about this greately improves the effectiveness of science videos<br>because i dare say that now that i am aware of this i pay more attention and are more likely to doubt my own preconcieved notions<br>i watched the <br>&quot;Best Film on Newton&#39;s Third Law.

Where as Veritasium&#39;s intent is to &quot;teach.&quot; From a student&#39;s perspective, the intended use of the videos plays a big part in determining their effectiveness as educational tools. 2) Clearing up misconceptions is obviously an important thing to do; but showing misconceptions by quizzing people on the spot is something that should ONLY be used in videos, NOT in an actual classroom. Quizzing a class before teaching a topic can be detrimental. What happens is students that already know the answer, or have a preconception, participate in answering pre-lesson &quot;quizzing&quot; questions. All of the other students are alienated; from their perspective the students who attempted an answer have some &quot;natural smartness,&quot; or extra ability. Leaving the ones with zero preconceived knowledge on the topic feeling like they are &quot;naturally incapable,&quot; or dumb. This is often what turns off students from the maths and sciences in the first place.  My question to Derek is: How does his research translate to person to person teaching?

The argument seems to be that <br>science videos do not work for first time learners unless they tackle common misconceptions alongside key concepts in physics.

This of would of course suggest, at first sight, that Khan academies videos don&#39;t work. This, however, seems too harsh, since the study doesn&#39;t really imply that science videos &quot;don&#39;t work&quot;. It only seems to suggest that, based on the study, science videos that do not tackle common misconceptions alongside scientific concepts are less effective than those that do. Without trying to defend Khan academy in anyway, it seem that this knowledge is related to khan academies physics videos only by suggesting that they would be more effective and better suited for first time learners, if they dealt with common misconceptions. This, however, doesn&#39;t imply anything for videos in other sections, such as maths, history etc..

When in modern educational games you find that you are awnsering questions and challenges, just so you can tcik them off and not have to do them again.. they also give more detailed information on  how to solve the questions, leaving less of the thinking for yourself.

Campbell himself says this about other material (other authors) and it should be said of his own work. \u00a0I can offer quotes of the &quot;punch line&quot;, how even atheists are mostly wrong, but that doesn&#39;t convey the understanding of why and show deep the problem goes in human socities.<br><br>How can atheists be wrong? \u00a0Because they don&#39;t equate Shakespeare and Mohammad. The fiction vs. non-fiction debate puts everyone in the wrong thinking... and people don&#39;t recognize that in fact Mohammad is the more popular and influential artist. \u00a0Atheists are often reacting to the &quot;wrongs of religion&quot; and seem unwilling to actually recognize the Quran as life-altering poetry. \u00a0The same can be said for all other religious books, and even non-religious fiction (films, art, etc).<br><br>\u201cHalf the people in the world think that the metaphors of their religious traditions, for example, are facts. And the other half contends that they are not facts at all. As a result we have people who consider themselves believers because they accept metaphors as facts, and we have others who classify themselves as atheists because they think religious metaphors are lies.\u201d \u2015 Joseph Campbell, Thou Art That: Transforming Religious Metaphor<br><br>Like your video is showing about learning, Campbell is saying that 100% of people (half + half), are bad learners. \u00a0I also think it was worth nothing that he was a professor at a university where the students were outright encouraged to stand up and confront their teachers... and to challenge their viewpoints. Also of note is that he includes science as the modern form of learning. \u00a0See his lecture I.1.4, with this quote: &quot;But now when one says truth as a scientist one is being sentimental, because really the wonderful thing and the great challenge of the scientific revelation is that science itself does not pretend to be true. It does not pretend to be final. // It is simply an organization of working hypotheses\u2014hypotheses that seem to take account of the facts, as we now know them. But is there any intention to stay with these facts? No. There is a continuous quest for more, as though one were eager to grow as though the life of man, and of society here, were to be based on new things, on change, on transformation, rather than on petrifaction and rigidity. And so we don\u2019t know anything. And even science itself is not the truth; it is only, so to say, an eagerness for the truth no matter where it may lead. // And so here again we have a still greater revelation than that of anything the old texts have to say; the old texts comfort us with horizons.&quot;<br><br>But really, if I had to put a number on it, I would say this type of material takes 3 years to learn and fully comprehend... and re-reading is essential. \u00a0We are not dealing with topics that our mind listens to easily. \u00a0Learning about learning itself is one of the problematic areas. \u00a0Thanks.", "comment_date": "2015-06-04T12:13:12Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Haider Rehman Butt", "comment_text": "Downwards and constant, obviously.", "comment_date": "2015-05-31T22:16:30Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Island ForestPlains", "comment_text": "The findings of this PhD thesis should not be unquestioningly generalized - as happens so often in education matters, There are times it is better to learn a fact with stating possible misconceptions first, as Veritasium suggests, and there are times, when &quot;errorless learning&quot; is better or even the only way to go, The latter especially when correct association is asked for and not understanding, like learning people&#39;s names, or the shape of letters or letter-sound associations while learning to read. You would not want people introduced, &quot;oh, this is not Anna or Berta, this is Clara&quot;, wouldn&#39;t you? Stating misconceptions gives people wrong ideas they might not have had in the first place, and sometimes makes them remember both facts or just the wrong fact and thus makes it hard to discriminate between what was correct and what not. It all depends on the people watching, their previous knowledge, their attitude and own questions about the matter while watching.
