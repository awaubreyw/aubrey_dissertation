Some information raised a few doubts in my mind. So I thought of asking you...<br>1) I have learnt from other sources that ice freezes in a hexagonal lattice which has got more space than the lattice of water state. So water tend to expand because of the Hydrogen bonding.. My doubt is when ice gets formed from the outer surfaces, it must so be like it creates a larger lattice space, &amp; so water must have been tending to expand into that comparatively large lattice space.. than coming out.<br>2) Secondly, It was known that water at 4 C (degree), has got maximum density and so ice bergs float.. It shows that ice, which is at 0 C will have less density..So having a dense fluid inside a low densed ice block, so why should it only tend to raise up only in that spiky direction, but not like oil coming out of a cylinder tank, (i mean, just spilling out \u00a0way)<br>3) The last one, as i&#39;ve a few figures, there were some spikes formed in a shape that it is thinner at the starting and thicker at the top .. why is it happening..?<br>Please explain", "comment_date": "2015-06-23T15:14:17Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Stephen Worrall", "comment_text": "I rarely comment on YouTube and this is that first time I have watched your videos...
