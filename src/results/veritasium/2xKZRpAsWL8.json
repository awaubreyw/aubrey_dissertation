Higher saturation of photons on free electrons enable them to skip from atom to atom due to their higher momentum. This is suggesting that photons are particles where arresting dynamic photons will increase their momentum. Einstein&#39;s famous equation, E=mc^2 is wrong otherwise garbage also can be used to make nuclear bombs as long as it is matter or it has mass. Energy and matter can&#39;t interchange one another according to Einstein&#39;s famous equation. One must have photons before one can emit out photons. Photons are particles and they have mass. All forms of EMWs including light and heat are dynamic photons per volume per time in different saturations. Photons are negatively charged particles. With higher saturation of photons onto free electrons will make them\u00a0 perceived to be more negatively charged. Since higher potential free electrons are saturated with more stationary photons therefore higher potential free electrons from\u00a0 cathode will encounter stronger suction for them by the anode. In conclusion, photons have mass and they are negatively charged particles. Therefore charge per mass ratio of electrons is not a constant since free electrons of different potential differences will have different saturation of stationary photons. If you are interested in real discoveries, I would recommend you to read my book, The Unification Theory - Volume One and you will be amazed with lots of new, interesting discoveries.

It&#39;s called the wave-particle duality. And not just some particles because then it would be called the some-paricle-wave duality. No, every particle can ( note the can ) behave like a wave and every wave can behave like a particle. Tho it is true that some particles are more often behaving like particles ( that&#39;s why we call them particles ) example: UV-light (or rays) are waves made up of fotons which are particles.", "comment_date": "2012-12-31T19:42:50Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Burnt Hombre", "comment_text": "derek&#39;s got a great cowlick in this vid", "comment_date": "2012-11-03T04:19:54Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Suhas Sharma", "comment_text": "You never know.", "comment_date": "2012-10-04T16:44:41Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "0zero0360", "comment_text": "Good eye balls!", "comment_date": "2012-06-04T17:53:56Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "jbocca70", "comment_text": "no condescending wonka= no learning", "comment_date": "2012-05-31T15:42:04Z", "likes_count": 2}, {"comment_by": "mydecembermydecember", "comment_text": "GUYS, LOOK OUT!\nTHERE&#39;S A SHARK ON THE TABLE!", "comment_date": "2012-05-29T12:35:18Z", "likes_count": 6}, {"comment_by": "LRFLEW", "comment_text": "&quot;One thought it was waves, and another thought it was particles.&quot; Funny how both turned out to be right :P", "comment_date": "2012-04-29T03:43:03Z", "likes_count": 4}, {"comment_by": "Hannes Storme", "comment_text": "i think it wil finaly run out of negatively charged particles but there are so many of them that it takes a huge amount of time. not sure though", "comment_date": "2012-04-07T16:42:35Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Jon Espinosa", "comment_text": "P.s.
