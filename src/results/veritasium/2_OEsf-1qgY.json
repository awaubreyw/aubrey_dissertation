Overpopulation places a great demand on resources and land, which may be the reason for widespread environmental issues in addition to impacting global economies and standards of living.<br>Poverty is to be believed as the major cause of overpopulation. High mortality rate and lack of educational resources, leads to high birth rates, resulting in a large population.<br>If overpopulation grows, this effect is said to be so widespread that the United Nations has predicted that the 48 poorest countries of the world contribute to the largest population growth. They estimate that the combined population of these countries is expected to be 1.7 billion in 2050 from 850 million in 2010.<br><br>The effects of the overpopulation are quite severe. One of these is the lack of natural resources. Earth has the capacity to only produce a limited amount of food and water, falling short of current needs of the people which are increasing day by day.<br><br>Rapid population growth makes the choice between high consumption and investment needed to bring more consumption in the future more scarce. Economic development depends on investment. Therefore, rapid population growth repels the investment needed for higher future consumption.<br><br>With a rapidly growing population, the adjustment becomes difficult to manage with economic and social change. Urbanization in UDC creates problems like housing, electricity, water, transport etc. In addition, the growing population is at risk of permanent environmental damage through urbanization in some rural areas.<br><br>The rapidly growing population transforms the economy into mass unemployment and low employment. As the population increases, the ratio of workers to the total population increases. The result is that with an increase in the labour force, unemployment and low employment increases. Rapid increment of the population reduces savings and investment.<br><br>Domestic consumption of exportable goods also increases with rapid population growth. As a result, there is a decline in the exportable surplus. On the other hand just to meet the demand of the rapidly growing population, more food and other consumer goods are needed so that demand can be fulfilled.", "comment_date": "2022-04-25T23:44:48Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "64plants", "comment_text": "Thanks for bringing me back lol", "comment_date": "2022-04-25T03:23:03Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Mathew Francis", "comment_text": "Why wasn&#39;t his breath condensing? i checked the dew point in Svalbaard....  -5 deg C...", "comment_date": "2022-04-21T15:54:53Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "M Walker", "comment_text": "And when we destroy the planet again and have no food, nobody will be able to access the seed vault.

Not only that but ANY seeds possible and same with genetic material of any plants animals and fungi bacteria ya look just all genetic material should be stored in such a vault as safe as that one! Why you may ask well let me give you this message and information for now I will ignore animals genetic material focus on plants and fungi as I don\u2019t know if storing it would help with preventing extinction or help with de extinction (the de extinction of animals we are making extinct now not animals that are already extinct though it could help I think I don\u2019t know as well) it\u2019s a bit more completed with animals the whole gender (some animals gender is dependent on the temperature of the egg) thing and the whole giving birth or laying the egg or whatever I\u2019m not talking about that because although I think it\u2019s a good thing we do that I don\u2019t know enough to form a argument about it. I\u2019m just here to talk about fungi spores and plant seeds and spores my opinion is that the extinction of any species whatsoever is a bad thing no matter what but here what I can say about this. Let me give you a example the American chestnut tree was a species of tree made extinct because of a fungal infection. What if before as a safeguard or during its decline as a last hope we saved seeds of that species in a vault much the same as this one? What if we did that? Well then we could bring the seeds of that species back making it not extinct because we saved it seeds before it went extinct in the wild now we may still have to get rid of the species of fungi that made it extinct in the wild I don\u2019t know but if we\u2019re not able to do that and save the current wild population what if we\u2019re able to do that after the current wild population is gone? Because the seeds were saved in a seed vault then we are able to bring them back but that never happened so we can\u2019t do that there gone forever because we never saved there seeds! That can work for any seeds or spores. What about a country thats destroying a forest and we can\u2019t plant any of the tree species that live in that forest anywhere else we also can\u2019t convince them to stop destroying the forest but we can convince them to save the seeds then years later that country wants to undo the extinction of the trees in wild or whatever and so they try to with the help of those preserved seeds bring back the trees that were lost from that forest or we find a way to without destroying the environment of somewhere else plant those trees somewhere else because we saved the seeds all those years ago we can bring them back! I don\u2019t know about animals but everything I said should work for all plants and fungi at the very least so although I do believe in saving all genetic material at the very least all fungi and plants should be saved food crops or not also are the mushrooms that are used as food crops being saved?", "comment_date": "2021-09-09T00:29:51Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Todd Kimball", "comment_text": "Question: How do they protect the population of fruit trees and vines that require grafting to produce the proper fruit?

I think this may be thermodynamic effects preventing the ball from bouncing ever smaller and smaller distances upwards. It may also be related to the shockwave distributing energy inside the ball as it bounces. Maybe it even has some quantum effects stopping this as well. Not sure if the other forces would stop it before it came down to the quantum level. It would be cool if you came up with an explanation.
