The Earth is FLAT! And there\u2019s no such thing as gravity!! Scientist can\u2019t even explain what gravity is!!

Fill up a balloon with half helium and half air and tell us what happens!!! The balloon will not rise or fall\u2026 it will maintain its perfect balance because it is not heavier or lighter than the air around it!! Facts! Also, if the earth was a sphere, how does the sun stay visible for 24 hours straight day after day during the summer solstice at the North Pole?? If the earth is spinning and changes its axis, how does the North Star Polaris manage to remain stationary in the same spot for millions of years if we\u2019re flying through space?? How does water stick to the bottom of the earth without completely falling off?? How strong must so called gravity be to hold the oceans, building, houses, people, etc onto the bottom of the earth?? Now once you get this gravity pull strength number, I want to know how can this answer be applied to the oceans, building and people that are on top of the earth?? My answer is that it\u2019s totally IMPOSSIBLE for gravity to operate in this way as if it had decision making abilities!! Scientist don\u2019t believing in GOD\u2026 right?

We don&#39;t live in 4 spatial dimensions, yet we use 4-dimensional numbers to rotate objects in 3-D space: the 4th spatial dimension doesn&#39;t exist, as far as we know, yet we can use it, just like multiplying arbitrary numbers together to form a Newton is still useful.<br><br>I wish my teacher had told us something similar instead of just telling us the definition of a Newton, which just seemed very arbitrary.", "comment_date": "2020-12-09T16:38:26Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Dominic V", "comment_text": "Imagine trying to spin earth...", "comment_date": "2020-12-07T15:02:55Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Sandy Ross", "comment_text": "I wonder how that kid&#39;s doing at 17", "comment_date": "2020-12-05T13:22:27Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Lynx of Light", "comment_text": "Dammit i wish i would get the chance to show my knowledge of physics to derek. <br><br>Come to germany to interview people pls ;_;", "comment_date": "2020-12-05T10:19:29Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Contessa Adella", "comment_text": "The deeper question is.....Why does Mass have inertia, and What IS Mass? <br>It\u2019s a toughie....but rooted in the energy of matter\u2019s constituent Quarks.....which kinda means there is only energy huh!!!
