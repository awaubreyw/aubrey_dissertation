Organic life a form is inPluto... yes they live inside Pluto. I will add more research results on my fb page, No assumptions only Formal photos from NASA and, surely no one believes until NASA say, btw the reason no visits is the same reason I don&#39;t play with snakes. we are too violent and aggressive, they don&#39;t accept it anymore, they have no crime nor punishment system, the see violence and punish as very primitive, very Buddhist like.. so they do not know how to deal with us. We can visit but we should consider the fact that whatever found is not our. deserted still belongs to owners. just started to put up, check in a few weeks. <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/Adam-and-the-Martian-friends-Art-collaboration-across-dimensions-314835632773691/\">https://www.facebook.com/Adam-and-the-Martian-friends-Art-collaboration-across-dimensions-314835632773691/</a>", "comment_date": "2019-06-19T03:42:06Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "floyd nelson", "comment_text": "who makes the policy that we can&#39;t land near water on mars? or other ethics policies applied to science", "comment_date": "2019-06-18T22:55:24Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "LightStreak567", "comment_text": "Ironically, it&#39;s because of The Martian (the film and novel) I find myself interested in videos like this.", "comment_date": "2019-06-18T19:50:15Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Gary Morrison", "comment_text": "In so many ways, Titan is a much more \u201cspitting image\u201d of the early Earth than is Mars:  Thick, nitrogen atmosphere and even a methane/ethane-based (rather than water-based) quasi-hydro-cycle, with pooling liquids, clouds, rain, erosion...

A manned mission to Mars would cost Trillions of U.S. dollars, and nobody in their right mind is going to spend that kind of money just for the sake of going there, so we can say we went there. Nobody is going to Mars for a long time. It&#39;s just not worth it. It&#39;s a product of economics. If NASA wants to continue to waste tax payers money on pointless rover missions to probe Mars, touch rocks, and drill little holes, then that is NASA&#39;s business, but in reality, we already know all there is to know about Mars. That is not the question. The question is, can we build a colony on Mars. Hell no. Mars is an extremely difficult place. In daytime, the temperature easily rises to 130 Fahrenheit; at night time, the temperature dips below 0. Not to mention the wind storms which can reach in excess of 200 mph. Also, the radiation.

The massive amounts of money that keep them doing cool stuff - and paying the bills. In other words, it&#39;s little more than a fraud.

That is, actually, not entirely true, the primordial material coming from asteroids and comets which aggregated in the early stage of the formation of Earth is believed to be pretty much the same material we are seeing on asteroids and comets today and while the Stardust mission collected some of the micrometeorites coming from those celestial bodies in 2006, we can actually find these kind of micrometeorites here on Earth. Obviously we can only find such micrometeorites in the most isolated places of our planet but it&#39;s doable and it is absolutely done. I actually work (as an intern, I&#39;m still a student) with the &quot;Laboratoire d&#39;Astrophysique du Solide&quot; in Orsay, France which is actively  gathering such micrometeorites in Antarctica and The Arctic and then studying them with Focused Ion Beam in Orsay.

For the ceremony, the Smithsonian had been given (or loaned not sure which, but eventually given) one of the testing duplicates of the Viking Mars lander. They had set it up on the front entrance area of the building and someone had fitted the sampling arm with a pair of scissors  on the end. As the speeches began, some official pushed a button which sent a signal (through Nasa&#39;s network) to the Viking lander which had just landed on the surface of Mars.
