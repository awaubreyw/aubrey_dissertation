If there is no contraction, that would deny einstein&#39;s belief. And if light is truly capped at a maximum possible speed, does that mean the faster you travel while projecting a beam of light forward would mean your light is travelling much slower than an equal beam of light projected by a stationary object? (example, if they develop impulse drive and get a starship going at one quarter the speed of light, and they fired a laser forward, would it be travelling at only 3/4s the speed of light relative to it&#39;s projection device, because it can&#39;t go faster than the maximum speed of light, and the projection device was already going 1/4 the max speed.

If you take the E=MCx2 equation but assume for the moment that M doesn&#39;t change then the only variable is t in the C squared, which does make sense. When you then re-equate the equation you find that time changes not Mass and this conforms with Einstein&#39;s time dilation. Therefor when speed increases,  then the time envelope of the action (AND THE PHOTON TIME FRAME) not the observer changes.

The problem wouldn&#39;t be the weight increase, it would the energy required.  Think about it this way, the only thing scientists know can travel at the speed of light currently, is light itself.  Er, rather, photons of light.  Photons are actually little packets of light energy that do not have mass.  They do have momentum, however, which allows the photons to interact with mass.  But that&#39;s a different lesson.  Anyways, since it has a mass of 0, if we plug it into the equation, E=0c^2.   So factoring it out, using proper order of operations, would leave us with E=0.   Meaning 0 energy is needed to move that light photon.   Now to figure out how much energy we would need to move a person, we just plug in the mass of that person into the equation.  Now the average mass of a person is 62 kg. (about 137 pounds)  So then the energy needed equals to 62 times the speed of light, 1.079e+9 km/h (about 670459517 mph) times itself which equates to 1.164241e+18 (4.4951596e+17).   Now the equation looks something like this E= 62 *  (1.164241e+18).  This means the energy needed to move a 62 kg person move at the speed of light is 7.2182942e+19 joules of energy.  That&#39;s the same energy as 17252137200 metric tons of TNT.  That&#39;s more than double the total global arsenal of nuclear warheads.

Who guarantees that there are not different types of light\u00a0?\u00a0If the light has\u00a0speed 300.000,\u00a0 Most scientists agree that gravity is applied instantly that&#39;s much faster than light.

The problem is how to do so. black holes either create a vacuum that makes the space around it go towards it, or the massive gravity sucks everything into it. Either way there is mass inside of the event horizon, which may slow down the light, thus trapping it. Also time moves faster than light, this is proven because if light moved as fast as time, then light&#39;s speed would be instant, literally un-measurable in a vacuum. So this presents the problem of how to go faster than light. One technique would be to create a black hole and have it propell you forward by sucking everything in front of you into it, the problem being making materials strong enough to withstand, hold, and nullify the black hole, which would have to be essentially indestructible.

Most likely that has already been observed quite deeply but when you think about it... It is said that when you go enough near a black hole not even a light can&#39;t escape it. That means there&#39;s so much energy which even overcomes the speed of light or in other words the speed of massless photons and it is also said that to outside observer it looks like the time stops when something goes close enough to a black hole.<br><br>So there it is. Black holes allow us to go faster than speed of light in our frame of reference outside the black hole even though in reality we are just going faster and faster closer we get to black holes while at the same time the speed of light &quot;runs away from us&quot; at the same rate as we speed up past the outside viewer&#39;s frame of reference&#39;s speed of light. For example. Imagine this. You sit in a car. Car goes like 100 km/h forwards. You throw a bag of peas forwards inside the car and at that moment the bag of peas is actually going at 120 km/h speed or so. Repeat this thing in a jet fighter flying 500 km/h in the air. The bag of peas goes now 520 km/h in the air. Repeat this inside a space shuttle flying through a black hole. The bag of peas now goes faster than the speed of light. However, to us the bag of peas still is going 20 km/h in all these situations even though to an observer outside the black hole the bag of peas is going faster than the speed of light.<br><br>Only problem here is the fact that how we make the acceleration so gentle and smooth that it actually wouldn&#39;t tear us apart as human beings when we go closer and closer to a black hole and maybe even enter it or go past it or whatever in order to actually confirm and test this theory. Also another problem would be the time and how it would act or bend or twist when we go to a black hole and when we come out of it, if we even ever get out of it. How could we make sure we still are in the same time frame when we exit the black hole as we entered it in order to relay information about our trip inside the black hole and then outside of it. The problem is that we most likely couldn&#39;t because time twists as we get closer and closer to a black hole.<br><br>Also another question arises to which I don&#39;t have an answer now. But the question is, how our size would actually behave when we approach a black hole. It is commonly viewed so that to someone outside viewing the black hole, as we enter it, to them we actually stretch indefinitely but at the same time this video tells us that to us the situation should look like so that we actually shorten indefinitely until our length aka size is actually 0. So how there can be 2 different extreme ends of sizes at the same time of the same object even though there&#39;s only one object?<br><br>Is that related to quantum physics and time itself as a dimension which we twist?

I&#39;ve been chasing this stuff all over the internet and especially youtube vids and this is the only one i&#39;ve found that explains this mirror thing. though the concept is so simple and follows exactly from what we&#39;ve been told - length contracts, time slows, mass increases, that I should have figured it out for myself.\u00a0 I think the convenience of the web is making me much more inclined to seek ready made answers rather than think for myself. it&#39;s turning me into a vast database of facts with no calculating power.<br>:)<br><br>now to continue looking for the answer to what happens when you look backwards in these &#39;near speed of light&#39; circumstances... I can&#39;t figure that one out for myself, either.<br><br>Well I still can&#39;t understand or find an explanation.\u00a0 And now I don&#39;t even know why I was so impressed by this video.\u00a0 Now it seems to me it explains very little. Perhaps that&#39;s just a measure of how confused I was before.<br><br>Right now I see very clearly that time and/or space must contract for someone moving close to the speed of light relative to me.<br><br>The concept is simple enough.<br><br>If they are moving at 0.9 c,\u00a0 nine tenths of the speed of light,\u00a0 then light beams sent forward from them will only travel at 0.1c relative to them.<br><br>That&#39;s so we, observing, can see them moving at 0.9c and light moving at c, as it must.<br><br>BUT, this is the &#39;tricky&#39; thing: THEY measure the speed of their light as c, despite the fact that it is only moving ahead of them at 0.1c.<br><br>How come?\u00a0 How to change the Speed = Distance/Time equation from the figures they&#39;ve got to figures that give a result of &#39;c&#39; ?<br><br>\u00a0Because they&#39;ve got:\u00a0 Distance:\u00a0 0.1 light second ( a measure of distance) / Time: 1 second\u00a0 and that should = 0.1c.<br><br>Obviously we have to change either Time or Distance or both.<br><br>\u00a0Slow down Time for them and it could be 0.1/0.1 = 1.\u00a0 That would do it.<br><br>\u00a0Or contract his distance measuring sticks (always quoted as &#39;meter sticks&#39; in the videos I&#39;ve been seeing, and apparently thought of as being laid end to end)\u00a0 so&#39;s the number of them he gets in thee makes him think the distance is 1 light second\u00a0 and so it could be 1 light second / 1 sec = 1 and that would do it.\u00a0<br><br>\u00a0So it&#39;s conceptually no\u00a0 problem.\u00a0 I think. Seems to me.<br><br>\u00a0Light doesn&#39;t vary it&#39;s speed but we always THINK it does because we THINK it goes at c PLUS whatever speed we&#39;re doing.<br><br>i.e. whatever speed we&#39;re doing we measure light and it is doing c.<br><br>So that&#39;s okay.<br><br>BUT:\u00a0<br><br>what happens to a light beam shining backwards from them?<br><br>It goes backwards at light speed. It must.\u00a0 And they go forward at 0.9c so the total must b e 1.9c.<br><br>We can see this. The observer can see this.\u00a0 In this thought experiment the observer sees the 0.1 thing clearly enough.\u00a0 Sees the wave front advancing before the space craft as a relative speed of 0.1c.<br>So surely it&#39;s equally valid for the observer to see the backward moving wavefront receding at 1.9c?<br><br>No.\u00a0 Somehow not valid.\u00a0 In this direction the observer is not allowed to see the truth. Or the truth is not as clear cut and simple.<br><br>The observer can only see 1c.\u00a0\u00a0 Regardless of the speed of recession, the speed with which the space ship recedes from the backward moving wavefront, an observer will only see a relative motion of 1c.<br><br>Hence the observer can only see a backward moving wavefront going at\u00a0 1c and a forward moving wavefront advancing at 1c.\u00a0\u00a0 A speed of 2c between them. I don&#39;t know how this is accounted for.\u00a0 Not relevant, I guess.\u00a0 The speed is measured from the point of origin, not from this wavefront to that wavefront.<br><br>I guess it is something like that.<br><br>Anyway:<br><br>So our traveller will measure 1.9 lightseconds distance in 1 second.<br><br>And he should come up with 1.9/1 = 1.9<br><br>But we can be confident it will come up with 1c so what&#39;s going to change?<br><br>Same as before. Time and/or Distance.<br><br>Time is easiest:\u00a0 1.9/1.9 = 1\u00a0 He must think nearly 2 seconds have passed when only 1 has passed.<br><br>Or if Distance is considered to have changed then he&#39;ll put 1/1 = 1 and he&#39;ll have shortened the 1.9 to only1. How&#39;d he do that?\u00a0 His fabled &#39;meter sticks&#39; must have nearly doubled in length.<br><br>So it looks like - to simple old me, waiting to be put straight - all the figuring that applies in one direction applies equally in the other direction and the effects in one direction are cancelled by the effects in the other direction.<br><br>And that&#39;s got to be wrong.<br><br>How?

I&#39;m no genius physicist, and I don&#39;t have a perfect understanding of Light&#39;s Particle-Wave Duality, but shouldn&#39;t an object that has a base velocity when it is propelled have a higher final velocity than its stationary counterpart? Back to the blue shift/ Doppler effect, imagine 2 identical machine guns, both with a firing rate of 10 rounds/second, pointed at a stationary target of x distance. However, one is on a stationary platform while the other is on a track connected to the target. When the stationary one fires, ten rounds will hit the target in exactly 1 second (assuming it is a perfect world). The second one will accelerate towards the target when firing, causing an increase in the base velocity of the rounds as it fires, causing ten rounds to hit the target in less than one second. As the process of firing ten rounds continues, the rounds will have a gradually higher base velocity relative to their preceding round. If we were to visualize the 10 rounds as being points on a line, the acceleration essentially causes the second line to be compressed, much like the compression of sound waves produced by a moving source. Is the same not true for light particles? Would the particles not have a higher velocity relative to their preceding counterparts? At base velocity=0, the velocity of the light particles=c. At base velocity=vsubn, shouldn&#39;t the velocity of the light particles=c+vsubn?
