One that is bursting. Its a very easy formula:<br>Internet advertising skyrocketed into interest with Google, Myspace, Facebook and Youtube. It was a genuine value as they were &quot;smart&quot; and &quot;targeted&quot; ads, vs the previous carpet bombing of the consumers vying for attention. This increased the value of ads over the traditional method. <br>Then came the abuses of the ad system. Buying engagement as a way to increase your value to platforms, and in turn, to advertisers. But the engagement is fake so your increase in value is only contingent on you being in the minority, among creators that provide actual value. So &quot;slipping through the cracks&quot; so to speak. This falsely increased the value of platforms to advertisers. Further driving up the perceived value of Facebook, google, youtube, etc.  <br>Then, the situation further escalated with full on &quot;internet celebrities&quot; appearing over night. Youtubers who were marginally popular on TikTok or other platforms, suddenly appearing into existence with millions of subscribers (clearly bought accounts). <br>And the biggest bombshell is the &quot;advertising companies&quot; themselves. They obscure and distill the real impact that their advertising real-estate has to a business. <br><br>Ultimately ads are only valuable if people buy the product. A friendly of mine owns his own company that installs window blinds. He used to pay for advertising on Facebook, google, and youtube. He has millions of hits on each platform with close to 0 real life customers resulting from that advertising. This may be statistically insignificant, but I believe its a much larger trend in the advertising space. <br><br>Facebook saw this and rebranded to Meta (rather poorly). But I believe that any company that relies on ad revenue for a main income method is in danger. The next 5-10 years are going to be very interesting.", "comment_date": "2022-08-11T14:01:44Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Rudy Saint", "comment_text": "It&#39;s because I just watch your videos not like share or comment", "comment_date": "2022-08-11T10:57:47Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "waqar ahmed", "comment_text": "Real Fan from Pakistan here \ud83d\ude00", "comment_date": "2022-08-09T12:42:34Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Mohammad Hefny", "comment_text": "I am from Egypt and one of your true real big fan.", "comment_date": "2022-08-08T18:20:16Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Nunofyour Business", "comment_text": "&quot;neo liberalism&quot;:<br>the descent of capitalism into quasi legal thieving, with the loot distributed among shareholders.", "comment_date": "2022-08-08T11:31:37Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Sven Lima", "comment_text": "I know somebody very well who likes every single video she watched, even if she didn&#39;t like it - just as a mark that she already watched this video.", "comment_date": "2022-08-07T10:02:36Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Fenn ViktorVich", "comment_text": "Most avid David Beckham enjoyer.", "comment_date": "2022-08-06T16:08:32Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "R McGraw", "comment_text": "var clickFarmThread=new Thread(new ThreadStartup()));", "comment_date": "2022-08-04T11:35:41Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "R McGraw", "comment_text": "LMAO, you use FB; what do you expect?

When I tried to share this video on WhatsApp from my android phone it didn&#39;t caption it  (WhatsApp automatically lists the video title next to the video thumbnail)  just above the typing area. I tried to confirm if this was some glitch with my phone or Internet or WhatsApp server so I tried to share some other video from YouTube immediately. Surprisingly WhatsApp captioned these videos. I tried sharing this video again and another video and repeated this multiple times but the results were still the same. So what does this tell us?<br><br>1. WhatsApp owned by Facebook which always argued for the cause of true and reliable information dissemination secretly takes a back foot when it is not in their interests.<br>2.

But in our country it is so easy to popularize your channel. all those people are not working as the click farm. they are using our sweet innocence to advertise one channel. they target the people who has a very good number of friends and active in that so called social media. And they offer them some money to reach at their goal. it is like your channel is been advertised by another person.S/he likes that and also through the algorithm is became spreading to another to like it. and people really do not know in which page they are liking. they just see that o&#39; s/he is liking the page i may like it. by this process your channel becomes popular by &#39;likes&#39; but not with true fan who are interested to you. they makes the facebook free here. a process they are also advertising their so called sympathy actually their business. but in last we must agree that by their BASIC FREE PROGRAM[where you can browse necessary sites{wikipedia,facebook,local e-paper etc} for free through this] is such  a great program as it helps many one to have the light of internet in their life. it is certainly like a blessing to many people and also for us. this is only my personal opinion. But in last i want to say it is our fault as we became greedy and sometimes we run after for fame so badly that we become fooled very easily. i think the credit goes to those guys who makes the best use you plus us and make their own profit like real businessman. it is just their strategy. this was only my personal opinion. i don&#39;t want to hurt anyone. <br><br>thank u .. <br>and keep doing your work sir .....", "comment_date": "2016-12-22T14:09:41Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Broken Road Media", "comment_text": "So that&#39;s why I see, &quot;Face Book is limiting our posts!&quot; posts.", "comment_date": "2016-12-22T08:25:52Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Haralabospap", "comment_text": "<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oVfHeWTKjag&amp;t=1m35s\">1:35</a> this is greek letters under his name , but why ?", "comment_date": "2016-12-21T15:49:14Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Ramen Azul", "comment_text": "I like anything", "comment_date": "2016-12-21T06:40:42Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "adam fleisch", "comment_text": "I liked and engaged", "comment_date": "2016-12-21T00:38:41Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Take a Break", "comment_text": "can you link the virtual cat page so we can like it", "comment_date": "2016-12-19T18:24:34Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Saransh Parimoo", "comment_text": "How did Facebook gets twice the money, from <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oVfHeWTKjag&amp;t=4m24s\">4:24</a> to <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oVfHeWTKjag&amp;t=4m58s\">4:58</a>, I didn&#39;t understand.", "comment_date": "2016-12-19T15:19:03Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Khaled AlYoussef", "comment_text": "I really like going to social media and YouTube and I rarely do  any engagement", "comment_date": "2016-12-19T12:52:16Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Carey A", "comment_text": "Great video.

We are advertising for a few years and building a significant amount of experience. We have discussed campaigns with other advertisers and compared &#39;call-to-action&#39; metrics. The consensus is that advertising on Facebook does not get results in terms of any call to action besides &quot;Likes&quot; which we suspect Facebook manipulates.<br><br>We have run a few experiments by abruptly ceasing advertising, placing our own tracker on the page and noticed that we accumulated a greater number of &quot;unlikes&quot; than visits to the page. As soon as we restarted the advertising campaigns, even small ones, the bleeding of likes stopped. The likes increased, even greater than hits to the page if we surged the advertising. We just recently made a decision to place our advertising dollars elsewhere.<br><br>We are a genuine NGO non-profit and are always strapped for cash as the cost of medicine and health care instruments climb through the roof.<br><br>We know Facebook ripped us off and cannot afford to have that happen; concomitantly we have a a fiduciary responsibility to our stakeholders not to deal with corporations that apply unscrupulous practices to their money-making antics.<br><br>The Facebook promises of &quot;reach&quot; are absolute nonsense. Compared to TV, Radio and Print there is no governing authority and no board of measurement that has any credibility to verify advertising cost per thousands. It&#39;s smoke and mirrors.<br><br>Facebook is extremely restrictive about advertising content because it has only contributor content as an asset. But sometimes the restrictions are absurd. There is no functioning redress for any problem.<br><br>We contemplate seeking out class-mates and bringing a class action suit against these rogue gangsters who have absolutely no conscience and no commitment to customer care. Our goal would be to recover all funds expended or those for which Facebook cannot offer a proof-of-performance.<br><br>There are other facets of our experience with Facebook which have been documented in Wikipedia with respect to Face book\u2019s&#39; &quot;rape pages \u201cand child exploitation policies.

NOW it gets interesting.  I didn&#39;t really give a crap about facebook boost post campaigns, having a following and don&#39;t really care about facebook.  But I would every now and then try to boost a post for $5.  Soon Facebook began allowing me to boost, but the budget options were much greater.  $20 then $40, $63, $90....I&#39;ve spent $10 or $20 here and there a few times,  but I thought it interesting they would reject my posts for the content, but then if I spent considerably higher budget on a campaign they would allow that.

To me it seems that liking something on Facebook doesn&#39;t matter much, if at all in their eyes.

What if you are a die hard Apple fanboy but still want to know what&#39;s up with Microsoft?<br><br>On another note, most of the people here accept friend requests from entirely unknown people. This is actually a pretty common thing, resulting most of the Facebook accounts here having friends from 400 to 4000. Not all these accounts are fake, mind it. I am studying at a reputed private university, and I have classmates from who have thousands of friends and followers on Facebook. I myself have roughly 1000 friends on Facebook, but I have worked in different organizations for the last few years, so I can say most of the friends are genuine people wanting to connect with me, and vice versa. How is this information related to unbelievable amount of likes in pages?<br><br>The more friend you have on Facebook, the more random page suggestions and posts you get in your news feed. And since people here are usually curious to keep connection with varied range of stuff, most of them end up hitting the like buttons of those pages. This can never indicate they honestly like the pages. Facebook doesn&#39;t have any problem with this trend though, because this mechanism only gets them more and more views of posts and pages.<br><br>I felt compelled to provide an explanation, if you can call my comment one, because I have never met a single person who actually does this $1 per 1k like sort of business. It&#39;s true sometimes these people spam on public groups, and I even got spam messages from unknown Bangladeshi people to like some page. But I never met anyone from my social sphere who actually does this sort of business.

You are not wrong or wasting your time. In fact back in India there are certain political parties that claim to have huge popularity based on Facebook likes. It creates a certain paranoia among the rest of the public which holds different opinions and are lead to believe that they are in the &quot;minority&quot; because their comments and posts don&#39;t get the same number of likes. Infact face book is not the only medium to adopt this strategy news papers have online comment section which get riddled with totally \u00a0stupid comments that seem to have more following aka likes. This leads newspapers to publish ...well nonsense to cater this audience. In fact the reality is so warped here that a young person who earns an average of 20-30k per month(which is a reasonable salary here) would be completely disconnected from reality if he/she spends 4 or more hours in front of a computer.

Typically, a larger percentage of views are also likes, and the ratio of likes to dislikes is around 100:1, for a &quot;like me&quot; video. On the other hand, a tiny percentage of views are likes for the others, with more like a 50:1 like to dislike ratio (assuming a decent video). The reason for this is simple; the &quot;sheeple&quot; are being asked to do something, and obeying.<br><br>The same holds true for facebook; I can&#39;t tell you how sick I am of seeing the words &quot;Like us on facebook!&quot; everywhere I turn.

Basically most marketing on Facebook involves some level of fraudulent likes. I firmly believe that Facebook is behind mess and encourages it. The ironic thing is that we were trapped in this as well. About three years ago we embarked on a paid Facebook campaign to increase our likes. Within a very short period of time we went from 14,000 legitimate likes to over 49,000 lights. We had no idea at the time that a large portion of those likes were from Third World countries with no clear reason to like our page. It did not make sense to us why those people we go out of their way to like her page. There was clearly no financial motivation for them or so we thought. We hired someone to do this for us who apparently was unaware of this issue. Unfortunately, to this day, we are hunted by this. we have even asked FaceBook specifically to help us remove the clearly fraudulent likes, those from Third World countries that have never engage with our website or our Facebook page. However, Facebook refuses to remove these fraudulent likes even upon our request.

Also interesting to see that.. &quot;Unlikes&quot; decrease if you pay for ads and increase a lot if you stop paying for ads - maybe some psychological influence by Mr. Zuckerberg? Delivering &quot;fake accounts&quot; which FB can make them &quot;unlike&quot; your page very easy again if you stop promotion!??? I think so.. Second thing.. its true.. I had so many times the case.. ads target to european countries, paid a lot of money for the ads and what i received.. were Likes from asia (Bangkog) and Egypt. Sure.. there are also poeple how like to take pics but.. as my main buis is in europe, Thailand and Egypt accounts/people will not create buis for me in europe. Finaly.. i fully agree that FB decreases organic reach and wants/needs to earn money. But.. the system isnt working the right way.. also becoming to expensive for middle class business. Ads are &quot;faking&quot; a lot but.. you need to pay... Support?? No, theres no support. Also.. how does Mr. Zuckerberg explain the huge decrease of reach to those admins who paid a lot of money all the years before to built up their Fanbase?? NOW you need to pay again a lot of moeny to reach them, so thats a huge rip-off, especially as organic reach on Pages +100K Fans is under 1%. Vicious circle.. You pay to grow but growing means less organic reach.. So, hopefully this questions of &quot;sense behind, why to pay for growing as its getting more expensive to reach your fans again&quot; will be announced by Big Players, sometime (for example Coca Cola or Nike). Last but not least.. based on this system, facebook is turning into fakebook. Pages with tons of fakes likes are\u00a0sprouting from the soil and also &quot;porn&quot; pages - so FB already lost the control. If facebook wont change their system and trie to become more clean and coming back from FAKEbook to facebook... its going to die within the next years!!!

First, I understand that Veritasium focuses on science videos. Well, the first thing I learned in each of my science classes was that in order for an experiment to have merit there must be a control group - clearly absent here.\u00a0<br><br>Secondly, why target countries like India then complain that a bunch of likes came from India? If you don&#39;t want likes from India, etc. then don&#39;t select those countries. But more importantly, when Mr. Muller shows us his likes he received graphed against engagement amongst his fans, he\u00a0seems to misunderstand is the purpose of the News Feed Algorithm.\u00a0<br><br>Mr. Muller only briefly explains how the algorithm works, but he doesn&#39;t explain why it is a function of FB. Engagement at times has very little to do with the amount of fans a page has. Because unlike most marketing platforms, FB reach doesn&#39;t come from the quantity of your followers, (opposite of an email distribution list). Instead FB reach is derived from the quality of what you are posting. Content is the distribution that is driven by the context of the conversation; A post in America will be received/viewed differently from a post in India because the context is different. That is the most important thing to understand when marketing on Facebook.\u00a0<br><br>Further, regarding the status he posted on the cat page he created: no wonder he didn&#39;t get any engagement -- the post wasn&#39;t very engaging!! I see this all the time. Posts that compel engagement ask questions, include multi-media, are thought provoking, and draw emotions so that people want to share it with their friends (thus expanding reach beyond the fans of the page). All of this is overlooked in the video.\u00a0<br><br>No disrespect to Mr. Muller - his YouTube presence is impressive, but he his making big conclusions based on a limited scope of understanding. Full disclosure: I work in social media marketing.

We work hard to maintain an ads experience focused on driving results against real business objectives \u2014 results which would not be possible from fake likes.<br><br>For additional context, I&#39;m happy to address some of the claims stated in the video:<br><br>\u2022 The example of the Veritasium Page is nearly two years old. We&#39;ve always focused on maintaining the integrity of our site, and have continued to place increasing focus on abuse from fake accounts. We&#39;ve built a combination of automated and manual systems to block accounts used for fraudulent purposes and Like button clicks. We also take action against sellers of fake clicks and help shut them down.<br><br>\u2022 The video makes assumptions about people from international countries who have liked the Veritasium Page. We have seen that many people in many developing countries like a lot of things on Facebook. There are numerous cultural reasons why this may be, but it does not mean that they are fake accounts. As we continue to iterate, we encourage you to use our robust targeting capabilities to reach the right people who matter to your business. Our ads interfaces allow you to target the right audience for your business based on country, interests, and other demographic or behavioral factors and we never recommend that you target the entire world if it doesn\u2019t makes sense for your business.<br><br>\u2022 We encourage you to post high quality, engaging content that correlates with your business objectives, targeted to the most relevant audience. While we also provide the option to pay for reach if relevant to your business objectives, earned and owned media is only part of the overall marketing opportunity for your business on Facebook.<br><br>We are constantly improving our systems for the benefit of people and marketing alike, and believe that we offer a powerful platform that drives significant business results \u2013 today more than ever before \u2013 and know this is possible through the power of authentic people who are active on Facebook daily.

Not only that, but if you include any 3rd world countries for targeting in the same ad you include 1st world countries, almost all of the budget will be spent on the 3rd world countries, not the 1st world. If the Bagel company had separated the countries to target USA and UK only, they would have gotten better results. This is just a great example of what happens when someone tries to run ads and doesn&#39;t know what they are doing. Your last example of the cat page was also bogus cause once again, you don&#39;t understand how facebook ads work. This is coming from someone (me) who has spent over $20K on Facebok ads in the last year and I&#39;ve gotten amazing results. If you don&#39;t know how to target your ads right, you will get crappy results, not because of facebook but because you don&#39;t know what the heck you&#39;re doing.

Spam is a massive industry that generates insane amounts of money polluting our experience every day. <br><br>As for Facebook there are valid points you made in this video however to condemn the entire platform and brand it as &quot;fraudulent&quot; is just plain wrong. I speak from experience when I say Facebook advertising is extremely effective, when done properly, with the right tools. Using the native ad manager on the fb platform I can understand why you feel this way. Think about it like this, a mechanic working on a race car would have specialty tools for every nut and bolt he turned. Ever one of those bolts all torqued to spec down to the most granular metric. That mechanic defiantly would not use an adjustable wrench and a hammer to perform his precision work. Then when the engine blew up coming off the starting line condemn the parts he used in the engine.  The same philosophy holds true here. <br><br>You need the right tools and the right strategy to effectively leverage Facebooks awesome potential. I have personally run campaigns on Facebook and delivered amazing results and when I say results I am referring to website traffic, leads, and sales! Yes sales actual $$$$<br><br>Is Facebook perfect ? Nope!  is anything man made ? Nope ! Are there professionals that do this everyday that know how to leverage results on Facebook and other channels that can track back to real ROI ? Yep absolutely. <br><br>Your video was well made and you are an excellent speaker with a platform of follower to stand on your soap box. We all have those moments. I am not saying you did anything wrong but your theory is far from iron clad.  You made some valid points but they are kinda 2011 -2012 for those of us that have been close to the industry and deal with the &quot;gamers&quot; every day. <br><br>The real value of Facebook is not likes and post engagement. It&#39;s knowing how to leverage Facebook to create a custom dynamic &quot; in stream&quot; experience for your target audience. The targeting available is amazing (it&#39;s not available on the native fb tool found at Facebook.com/advertising)<br> <br>Forgive any typos and spelling I&#39;m on my phone and didn&#39;t really plan to write that much. <br><br>Take care everyone, <br>G.<br><br>", "comment_date": "2014-02-11T04:40:18Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "TALLOWSmusic", "comment_text": "seriously though thank you for that video.", "comment_date": "2014-02-11T04:36:38Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Delwar Jahan", "comment_text": "I am from Bangladesh, I do not comment or engage with your video or page.

First you have to determine if an account is false, which is easier said than done when you have 1 billion+ users. Use a machine learning algorithm that&#39;s too lenient, and the problem you have discovered appears. Use too strict of an algorithm, and you could risk deleting legitimate user accounts and thus angering legitimate users.\u00a0<br><br>Also, to some of the viewers: I don&#39;t think Facebook is paying click-farms to do this. From what the video theorizes, click-farms try to get around Facebook&#39;s click-farm detection software and hide their activity by just liking everything under the sun, thus making it harder for FB to detect what are spam likes and what aren&#39;t.<br><br>So unless you can find transactions between FB and click-farms, I doubt you will win any sort of court case for fraud :)", "comment_date": "2014-02-11T02:10:02Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Bonnie Davis", "comment_text": "I lost my connection and could not share to my F/B page.

Real identity, for both users and brands on Facebook, is important to not only Facebook\u2019s mission of helping the world share, but also the need for people and customers to authentically connect to the Pages they care about. When a Page and fan connect on Facebook, we want to ensure that connection involves a real person interested in hearing from a specific Page and engaging with that brand\u2019s content. As such, we have recently increased our automated efforts to remove Likes on Pages that may have been gained by means that violate our Terms.<br>\u00a0<br>On average, less than 1% of Likes on any given Page will be removed, providing they and their affiliates have been abiding by our terms. These newly improved automated efforts will remove those Likes gained by malware, compromised accounts, deceived users, or purchased bulk Likes. While we have always had dedicated protections against each of these threats on Facebook, these improved systems have been specifically configured to identify and take action against suspicious Likes.<br>\u00a0<br>To be clear, we do not and have never permitted the purchase or sale of Facebook Likes as we only want people connecting to the Pages and brands with whom they have chosen to connect. Beyond the need to maintain authentic relationships on Facebook, these third-party vendors often attempt to use malware or other forms of deception to generate fraudulent Likes, which is harmful to all users and the internet as a whole.<br>\u00a0<br>These improvements to our site integrity systems benefit both users and brands alike. Users will continue to connect to the Pages and Profiles they authentically want to subscribe to, and Pages will have a more accurate measurement of fan count and demographics. This improvement will allow Pages to produce ever more relevant and interesting content, and brands will see an increase in the true engagement around their content.<br>\u00a0<br>To help protect yourself in the future, please be aware of suspicious links and visit <a href=\"http://www.facebook.com/hacked\">www.facebook.com/hacked</a> if you have any reason to believe that your account may be compromised. We also highly recommend that Page owners vet any business that offers marketing services to build your Facebook presence, to make sure that these companies are using only legitimate practices, which do not violate the Facebook Terms.<br>\u00a0<br>Facebook was built on the principle of real identity and we want this same authenticity to extend to Pages. We undoubtedly expect that this will be a positive change for anyone using Facebook, and we look forward to helping even more people share and connect with the friends and brands they care about.", "comment_date": "2014-02-10T20:31:10Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "digger4400", "comment_text": "This is why I don&#39;t engage in social media.", "comment_date": "2014-02-10T20:31:08Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "SuperCool Art Kit", "comment_text": "Class-Action lawsuit?
