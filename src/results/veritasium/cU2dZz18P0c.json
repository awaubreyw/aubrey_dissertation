But just know that somewhere out  there a 14 year old is thinking about his existence. His brain is stimulating thought, and sending electricity to the muscles in his hands and arms to be able to type on a keyboard. The keyboard is made up of pieces of plastic that are attached to sensors that convert information about which sensor is being pressed into electric bursts of energy through a copper wire which is plugged into a computer processor, which is translating those bursts of energy into 0s and 1s. Those 0s and 1s are being processed by that computer&#39;s motherboard, where the data is then transferred out of an HDMI port, through and HDMI cable where his monitor is converting more 0s and 1s into a picture that flashes on the screen at over 75 times per second. All at 186,282.397 miles per second. Pretty crazy right?

For instance, while trying to knock Buster out of his socks they resorted to a much heavier pendulum traveling at a lower velocity to simulate being struck by something traveling at a greater velocity. It would seem that Buster can only be accelerated to an average velocity compared to the object that strikes him. For instance if the object striking him\u00a0 has a mass of 200 Kg while buster has a mass of 50Kg (warning, arbitrary numbers, I know that Buster does not have a Mass of 50 Kg nor did the object striking him have a mass of 200 Kg) then Buster would accelerate the pendulum in a negative relation equivalent to the force that the pendulum accelerates him positively. (In relation to their initial velocities) So if the pendulum was traveling at 25m/s before it strikes him then after the impact BOTH Buster and the pendulum would be traveling at 20m/s in the same direction. Therefore only 1/5 or 20% of the TOTAL energy of the pendulum would be transferred to buster.<br><br>This is assuming that there is no flexing involved which could absorb energy at impact and then rebound after the objects are moving at the same velocity to accelerate Buster to a GREATER velocity than the pendulum is traveling at after striking buster. This is actually an interesting phenomenon.<br><br>Actually, I would LOVE to see a video by Veritasium explaining &quot;How can Golf clubs cause a Golf Ball to travel FASTER (a.k.a. at a higher velocity) after being struck than the initial velocity of the club face&quot;?", "comment_date": "2015-06-05T05:28:25Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Gabriel Bruneau-Langlois", "comment_text": "Spidey looks a bit tipsy.", "comment_date": "2015-05-21T04:32:12Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "funnychilli123", "comment_text": "I&#39;v giving up all hope on humanity", "comment_date": "2015-05-19T05:17:37Z", "likes_count": 41}, {"comment_by": "jurpo100", "comment_text": "well it depends.
