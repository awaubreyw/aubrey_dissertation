I think the fire will still create patterns with the holes. Please try it and if I&#39;m right video the results and post them. I&#39;m interested in what the patterns would look like because if you put frequency to a flat metal plate with salt or very fine sand on it different frequencies send the salt or sand into distinct patterns for each different hertz and I&#39;m pretty certain you will get the same results with your fire. You can see the salt on the metal plate videos here on YouTube. The patterns are very interesting to watch develop. I think it would be just as interesting, if not more interesting, to see them in fire so I would appreciate it if you would try that out to see if I&#39;m right.

I understand that motion alters the rate of time duration and also affects distances. The way i was explained this was if for example one person was traveling in one direction faster than another person. Then a beam of light was fired in the same direction as the person moving faster. Since the speed of light is constant for all inertial frames of reference, the person moving with the light must adjust time to travel slower and distances to become shorter so the light can cover more distance in less time and result in the same perceived speed. But what if for example, a beam of light was fired from the other direction, the person is now traveling against the light, which means that the light would look faster. But since light travels at the same speed, time must go by faster and distances must become longer so that the light can cover less distance in more time, giving the same speed for light. But how is this possible? How can the person moving faster than the other person have both slower time and faster time, both shorter distances and longer distances. What happens when a beam of light is fired both from ahead and behind?", "comment_date": "2014-05-01T09:46:43Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Mr La", "comment_text": "Cool.

It is important to make a distinction between pressure nodes and displacement nodes. As you know, a node is where the variation in the relevant quantity is zero (zero pressure variation or zero gas particle vibrational motion, respectively), but the location of pressure nodes and displacement nodes are out of phase (in 1D, pressure nodes occur at displacement antinodes, and vice versa).  At <a href=\"http://youtu.be/2awbKQ2DLRE?t=1m40s\">1:40</a>, we see the fundamental standing wave in the box, and observe stronger flames at the sides of the box where the gas molecules cannot move perpendicular to the container walls. At these points, the pressure variation is maximized, so we conclude that maximum flames occur at PRESSURE antinodes. By this reasoning, the animation shown at <a href=\"http://youtu.be/2awbKQ2DLRE?t=0m33s\">0:33</a> is incorrect because is shows maximum gas particle motion where the flames are largest.", "comment_date": "2014-04-19T11:23:49Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Nicolaas Strecker", "comment_text": "I can see SOUND!!!", "comment_date": "2014-04-19T11:21:50Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Emilio Kazanova", "comment_text": "sheme pls!!!!", "comment_date": "2014-04-19T11:18:11Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Tyler Whieler", "comment_text": "2D rubens tube \u00a0x 100 times + tommorowland mainstage would be amaaaziinggg", "comment_date": "2014-04-19T11:12:23Z", "likes_count": 2}, {"comment_by": "Klem Michard", "comment_text": "What are the frequencies we are looking at ?", "comment_date": "2014-04-19T11:09:44Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Alessia Zhou", "comment_text": "That&#39; s hypnotic .", "comment_date": "2014-04-19T10:52:56Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Stefan Hemmes", "comment_text": "Sick!
