Nonsense ! The problem lies in the fact that the host confuses length for number of points in a line. ( The first subject is developed by Calculus while the second topic is covered by Cantor Set Theory.) The coast of Australia has an infinite number of points but a finite length.<br>To understand this fact, consider a circle of radius r. Its circumference is equal to  2*Pi*r, a finite irrational number,  while the number of points in the circle is infinite. ( This happens to equal the number of points in a line segment)<br>Furthermore, you can draw a circle entirely inside the Australian border of say, radius a and draw a circle outside of the Australian border of radius b which entirely contains it. This would make the length of the border greater than or equal to 2*Pi*a and less than or equal to 2*Pi*b. Both of these numbers are real irrational numbers, so the border&#39;s length is finite. Thus, the distance of the Australian border cannot be infinite.<br>This situation is different from the Koch    snowflake because with each iteration of the fractal loop, you are making the circumference of the snowflake longer as well as its size larger, thusly increasing the area within the snowflake. This means that the Koch snowflake is not a finite area enclosed by an infinite border.<br>I hope this helps clear up any confusion.

You cannot keep cutting up something in half or thirds or whatever forever. Eventually there must be a distance that cannot be halved any further. Think about it, if you could keep halving something forever, you could literally never move. Let&#39;s say you move your arm a meter. Well, if you could half distances to infinity, there&#39;s literally an infinite amount of space between your arms starting position and the end of the meter. So your arm could never reach the meter. As soon as it started moving, it would just keep halving the distance. You wouldn&#39;t even be able to move more than a Planck length. It&#39;s strange to think of it that way, but essentially you would be moving but you also wouldn&#39;t be. The mere fact that you are able to move shows that you cannot divide space infinitely. There must be a distance that cannot be divided any further. And I know about supertasks by the way, and I don&#39;t really think they&#39;re possible.

Since the shortest distance between two points is a straight line, taking a particular curve segment and approximating with a line will give you the minimum distance estimate on that segment. Pick a point on the segment and now use two lines to approximate the curve. By triangle inequality, this is at least as big as the single line (it&#39;s only equal if the original segment is a line already). So, as you continue to increase the number of points in your approximation, you get a non-decreasing sequence which converges to the true length of the curve. For relatively tame curves (all derivatives are sufficiently small), this convergence happens quickly and so increasing the amount of lines yields a smaller and smaller increase in the measured length. However, for something like a coastline, we have large derivatives and so the convergence is very slow. This gives the appearance of no upper bound. <br><br>In reality, it&#39;s very difficult to calculate any lengths very accurately at all, since even a seemingly straight edge like the end of a ruler can have thousands of tiny dents, plus the texture of the material, and then the structure of the molecules and atoms. So, in order to measure any length (or surface area), we have to decide what shape it most closely represents and calculate that.
