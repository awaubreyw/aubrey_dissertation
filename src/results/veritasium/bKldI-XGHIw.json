Inheriting his father\u2019s enthusiasm for machines, young Buteyko studied at the Kiev Polytechnic Institute until World War II started and he left to join his country\u2019s armed forces. After his experiences during the war, Buteyko felt compelled to study what he called \u201cthe most complicated piece of machinery of all\u201d \u2013 the human organism.<br><br>Doctor Konstantin Pavlovich Buteyko received his medical degree from the First Medical Institute in Moscow, where he studied from 1946 to 1952. During this period he had a medical practice attending and dealing with severely sick and critically ill patients. A series of events helped him to realize the connection between the respiration and health of patients with hypertension, angina pectoris, asthma, and some other serious diseases. He noticed that with approaching death, patients\u2019 respiration got heavier. By visual observation of patients\u2019 breathing in the hospital, he could predict how many days or hours of life were left. Later he discovered that deliberate acute hyperventilation quickly worsened the health of patients while breathing less caused the elimination of their symptoms.<br>Buteyko also confirmed these findings in his own problem, hypertension. He then decided to devote his life to studying respiration, in general; and CO2 properties, in particular.<br><br>After graduation with Honors, in 1952, he joined the Department of Clinical Therapy of the same institute, working as the manager of the Laboratory of Functional Diagnostics in Moscow. Among his concerns were a lack of qualified personnel, inadequate equipment, and financial problems. He then had more time to study western publications about breathing. During these years the Soviet state was developing the unique program of outer space exploration for the first space missions. It was of exceptional importance to know and study the effects of air parameters (air pressure and its composition) on human health.<br>Hence, Soviet officials were looking for bright young scientists who could lead such projects in physiology and medicine. At the end of the 1950\u2019s, he was chosen to head such a project in Novosibirsk. Due to the importance attached to the project, his laboratory was provided with the best available equipment and best-qualified support.<br><br>Obviously, in this research, as, for example, in any similar NASA research, its people and facilities were heavily guarded by Soviet state officials, including KGB agents. The aims of this research included:<br><br>\u2013 finding optimum air parameters for human functioning during space missions depending on the stage of the flight and initial parameters of astronauts;<br>\u2013 breathing of healthy and sick people and interactions between various diseases and respiration;<br>\u2013 effects of various environmental factors (sleep, sleeping postures, exercise, posture, meals, diets, daily activities, temperature, thermoregulation, emotions, etc.) on breathing, oxygenation, and health.<br><br>Thus, in 1960 Buteyko became the manager of another Laboratory of Functional Diagnostics organized at the Institute of Experimental Biology and Medicine in Novosibirsk. Buteyko created in his laboratory a unique diagnostic complex, which included several physiological devices to measure 40 important health parameters in real-time (or with each breath). According to Buteyko and Dyomin, \u201cOne such investigation, lasting about 1 hour, produces about 2,000 recordings of 40 main parameters of respiratory and cardiovascular processes, resulting in about 100,000 numbers\u2026\u201d (Buteyko &amp; Dyomin, 1963). These parameters included pulse, EKG, blood pressure, tidal volume, respiratory rate, minute ventilation, arterial and venous blood gases and chemical analysis of the expired air. The complex produced many thousands of measurements per hour, analyzed by a computer. The unique features of this complex were described in the Soviet magazine \u201cIzobretatel\u2019 i ratsionalizator\u201d (Inventor and Efficiency Expert, 1961; Buteyko 1961; Buteyko, 1962). Some characteristics and abilities of this machine were also reported in more than 20 scientific articles written by Buteyko with his colleagues and published in medical, physiological and diagnostic magazines and conference proceedings.<br><br>Research with the use of this complex was done from 1960 to 1968. That allowed Buteyko to receive information about physiology and respiration of the human organism in health and disease and relationships between respiration and different factors, including sleep, sleeping postures, exercise, posture, meals, diets, daily activities, temperature, thermoregulation, emotions, etc.<br><br>Not only did he brilliantly conduct and complete these studies funded and initiated by the USSR\u2019s Ministry of Aviation and Space Exploration, but he also discovered and practically confirmed the fundamental role of breathing in the development and treatment of various health conditions, including asthma, bronchitis and heart disease. Given the confidential nature of the project, it was normal that many results remained classified for years. (Compare Buteyko situation with the situation of the famous Oxford Professor John Haldane, who was hired in 1920-1930s by British Navy to study air in submarines and whose name then disappeared from the world scientific community.) This, however, was not the case with Buteyko and his colleagues. They had dozens of publications in the open Soviet literature (in Russian) about their research in the 1960s. Moreover, in the 1990s Buteyko and his numerous pupils were able to travel to Western countries and share the word about the Buteyko method and his discoveries.<br><br>Doctor Buteyko died peacefully, at the age of 80, in Moscow on Friday, 2 May 2003.<br><br>For more information about the Buteyko method you can read the following 2 articles:<br><br>- Kazarinov V.A.

We resonate one with existence which is the unified field/matrix or what people call God. God is a gestalt of electrical/magnetic energy field vibrations. We are, so God must be. Some physicists call God a holodeck. How else are we images? Barbara Brennan wrote that we are holograms. We are not solid. Would you call electricity solid? We are highly concentrated frequencies and coils. There are 7,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000 atoms of spinning and vibrating energy we consist of. Apparently, atom is a name of a mathematical expression that is run through a computer. I thought that when something was named, then it could be seen.<br>SO........does electricity die or age? NO. It would immediately stop if the motor or generator was turned off. But we are connected to some kind of self generating holodeck where what we think becomes images. In this dimension our thoughts/images sometimes take days, weeks or years to pop up. But when we leave these bodies, what we image pops up immediately every time. Read the Seth books. Seth is an electrical being existing in another dimension. I read these books because I had a NDE as a child. These beings I felt and heard loudly. The book &quot;Seth Speaks: The Eternal Validity of the Soul&quot; is wild for your imagination. You will be accelerated, shocked and bewildered that we are not taught this in this dimension. These electrical energy beings formed my childhood and continue to form my existence with their constant focus. When you read this book you will realize that you are not alone. All of us are personalities of our souls. That means we are one with our souls. Through resonance we are able to gain knowledge of amazing proportions. I learned to heal myself and others super fast in my 20&#39;s by reading books. There are a lot of books that teach we are imagery itself. Electrical imagery. There is the book &quot;Healing Yourself&quot; by Rossman M.D. and &quot;Hands of Light&quot; by the physicist Barbara Brennan. There is &quot;The Quantum World&quot; by the physicist Kenneth Ford. And if you want to  know why we are not taught we are electrical/holographic beings, then the book &quot;War Against the Weak&quot; by Black will inform you. But there are many others.<br>I received this email recently from the site Ask a Mathematician, Ask a Physicist:<br><br>What are &quot;actual pictures&quot; of atoms actually pictures of?.<br><br>Physicist:<br>Actual pictures of atoms aren\u2019t actually pictures at all.<br>There are a few good rules of thumb in physics.  Among the best is:<br>light acts like you\u2019d expect on scales well above its wavelength and<br>acts weird on scales below.  In order to take a picture of a thing you<br>need light to bounce \u2026<br><br>The only thing physicists have actually seen is basically a computer<br>image, not the real image, and second, they observe electric fields,<br>not the particle itself. They do not observe particles themselves;<br>they are able to observe only the field. However this alone does not<br>prove anything, but that the electric energy field exists and that\u2019s<br>about it---no atoms, no photons, no electrons, no quarks. no nothing.<br>So no, particles do not exist. Particles exist only inside<br>mathematical abstractions and nothing more and nothing else. We don\u2019t<br>know what actually exists in the real world, except that there are<br>energy fields---electric, magnetic and all other forms and all other<br>kinds of energy fields.<br><br>I forgot to add what exactly is visualized with all these microscopes<br>including STM--the scanning tunneling microscope. What is visualized<br> is the charge density of the electric field.<br>Basically you observe vibrations---electric vibrations.<br>You haven\u2019t seen an atom either. You\u2019ve seen an image you assume to be<br>an atom, but it is simply an instrument\u2019s representation of the atom.<br>It is not the atom itself.<br><br>These techniques aren\u2019t actually \u201cvisual\u201d like microscopes we work<br>with in biology classes. Microscopes use lenses and light to help zoom<br>and focus on small objects. Electron microscopes, on the other hand,<br>use quantum scattering theory to construct the shape of small objects,<br>then the data is transferred to a computer to create a model. The<br>wavelengths of visible light ranges on the order of ~370nm to 750nm.<br>These are all MUCH larger than many particles of interest (and way too<br>large to view atoms, which are on the order of Angstroms\u20130.1nm).<br>Scientists need to be creative to be able to \u201csee\u201d atoms.<br><br>So, no, scanning tunneling microscopes and atomic force microscopes<br>did not prove the existence of atoms.", "comment_date": "2018-06-19T12:53:43Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Sun Shine", "comment_text": "Photons are made up.

An atom with a full electron shell has it&#39;s outer electrons feel attraction strong enough so that no other atom can steal it, or share it. That&#39;s why noble gasses don&#39;t interact with other elements much.<br> But when you jump to the next element, you have to go to the next electron shell. And while you have one more proton to attract the electrons, the distance grows as well. And the distance has more influence in this case. <br><br>As for why the electrons pass to other atoms, that&#39;s becasue an atom with the same shell number, but more protons, attracts those electrons with more force. enough to partialy rip them from their original atom.", "comment_date": "2017-09-26T13:55:42Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Faladrin", "comment_text": "A zero size object scaled up by infinity would still be a zero sized object.

Still not as interested, I did what any other confused kid would do; I went on YouTube looking for &quot;scientific videos&quot; and found your channel. I began watching your videos and couldn&#39;t stop. I feel pretentious watching them due to the lack of my knowledge, but it has been inspirational.
