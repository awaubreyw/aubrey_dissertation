This explanation accounts for why the water freezes from top to bottom also. Secondly,  why do you say that you need very pure water for this? The trick works for soda too. Although it does turn into slush and not a solid mass. Lastly, my father does this trick all the time at work and will have the liquid sitting in there for no specific amount of time, and the liquid does not freeze on its own.

That was when Dasani was new to the mass market. Since then the bottle and probably the water itself has changed and now it&#39;s much more difficult to recreate. It seemed to me at the time that a few factors were responsible. The bottle was thick (rigid plastic) and well sealed, which kept the water under pressure and ice crystals from forming. Water is naturally denser at 4 C than when frozen, but keeping the bottle under pressure extends this dense state to temperatures below freezing. A freezing point a few degrees below 0 is then required to exert enough pressure on the casing to form ice crystals. To test this, simply open or gently puncture the super-cooled pressured bottle and it will turn to an ice crystal. There are probably other methods, such as using monopolar ions or electrical currents, but I would venture to guess that in the common super-cooled water bottle trick, pressure plays a significant part.", "comment_date": "2013-11-20T06:51:11Z", "likes_count": 3}, {"comment_by": "James A.", "comment_text": "I have had that kind of thing happen to me grabbing a Gatorade or snapple mango madness out of the freezer", "comment_date": "2013-11-20T06:31:00Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Lewis Bloomer", "comment_text": "so what if you started to drink it before it formed into a crystal, would it freeze your tongue?", "comment_date": "2013-11-18T23:53:14Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Scott Ste Marie", "comment_text": "why is my computer slow?\u00a0", "comment_date": "2013-11-18T19:23:34Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "timl2k11", "comment_text": "Fiji water is anything but pure, it says so right on the bottle.
