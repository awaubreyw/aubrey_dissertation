It knows this because it knows where it isn&#39;t. By subtracting where it is from where it isn&#39;t, or where it isn&#39;t from where it is - whichever is greater - it obtains a difference or deviation. The guidance subsystem uses deviations to generate corrective commands to drive the missile from a position where it is to a position where it isn&#39;t, and arriving at a position that it wasn&#39;t, it now is. Consequently, the position where it is is now the position that it wasn&#39;t, and if follows that the position that it was is now the position that it isn&#39;t. In the event that the position that it is in is not the position that it wasn&#39;t, the system has acquired a variation. The variation being the difference between where the missile is and where it wasn&#39;t. If variation is considered to be a significant factor, it too may be corrected by the GEA. However, the missile must also know where it was. The missile guidance computer scenario works as follows: Because a variation has modified some of the information that the missile has obtained, it is not sure just where it is. However, it is sure where it isn&#39;t, within reason, and it know where it was. It now subtracts where it should be from where it wasn&#39;t, or vice versa. And by differentiating this from the algebraic sum of where it shouldn&#39;t be and where it was, it is able to obtain the deviation and its variation, which is called error.", "comment_date": "2022-04-17T15:43:36Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Matthew Lettin", "comment_text": "Thank you <br>I was looking for a tutorial on how to launch my nuclear missile", "comment_date": "2022-04-17T13:11:59Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "MrJdog1987", "comment_text": "The USA peacekeeper LGM-118 ICBM was the largest in a matter of size and had the capabilities of deploying the most warheads it was retired in 2005 for a few reasons 1 cost of maintenance and a few other like treaty agreements with Russia", "comment_date": "2022-04-17T12:05:10Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Wesley Chebabi", "comment_text": "We have never been so closer to that situation since the 24th of Februray \ud83e\udd7a", "comment_date": "2022-04-16T18:13:07Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Lars", "comment_text": "Thanks for the information, it really helped me out :D", "comment_date": "2022-04-16T16:15:41Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "R Rar", "comment_text": "well...I think when you push Russia, by surrounding with NATO countries, pushing, pushing and pushing, they might think...you know what.... let us all die together.

You NATO and Russia must be united in the true truths that your religious and political systems of beliefs are stupid and troublemaking. Why? \r<br>Here is why:\r<br> PART 72\r<br>The Main Causes and Wise Solutions for the Problems of World Peace and Order, Hungers and Wants, \r<br>Stupid Wars and Terrorisms \r<br>1The Arabs\u2019, Israelis\u2019 and all other nations\u2019 wars against each other are/were actually primarily caused by: \r<br>\u2022\tTheir stubborn and unwise rejection of the wise commonization or making all the lands or natural resources of our world as the commonwealth or common possession of all human beings where there will be NO need to kill or die for in land, sea or air disputes; \r<br>\u2022\tTheir freedoms of believing, following, praying and worshiping their false Almighty Allah, El, Elohiym, Yahweh, Jehovah, Hashem (Deuteronomy 10:17 and Genesis 49:24) Nam, Brahma, Vishnu, Krishna, Shiva, Theos or Theoc or Deus (that is, Zeus), Lord, God et cetera.\r<br>2Therefore, to stop their warrings in our world so that we may have true lasting happiness, love, unity, security, prosperity, justice, peace, and order in our world: \r<br>\u2022\tIt must be to make our entire world our commonwealth or common possession in a legal way by the True Truths and True Wisdoms; \r<br>\u2022\tIt must be to stop giving to them such religious unwise freedoms in a legal way by the True Truths and True Wisdoms. \r<br>PART 73 \r<br>The True Wisdoms Are the ONLY Wise Solutions for the Problems of World Peace and Order That Caused \r<br>Hungers and Wants, Stupid Wars and Terrorisms \r<br>1It is a true truth that true wisdoms are more precious than all the diamonds, golds and moneys, and are the best defense and offense and are more powerful and better than all the martial arts and all the weapons of wars (Ecclesiastes <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knDIENvBTgw&amp;t=9m18s\">9:18</a>). \r<br>2One of the causes, why the true wisdoms are such precious and important, is the true truth that by cause of the stupidities, psychopathic lies and deceptions, wrong judgments or false wisdoms: \r<br>\u2022 You will surely NEVER know what one or first is; \r<br>\u2022 You will surely NEVER know what good or evil, right or left, correct or wrong and true or false are; \r<br>\u2022 You will surely become a troublemaking crazy fool whom the truly wise government must put to death; \r<br>\u2022 You will surely suffer or die from COVID 19 or from some other deadly diseases; \r<br>\u2022 You and your loved ones will surely lose all the precious stones or metals, diamonds, gold bars, moneys and all your other desirable things you may have now tomorrow in the religious and political thermonuclear wars, which will surely be caused by the psychopathic lies and deceptions, stupidities, wrong judgments or false wisdoms. \r<br>3In the following paragraphs are some of the true wisdoms of the one and only true Rabbi USA ta Mondomuni. \r<br>4According to Deuteronomy 10:17 and Genesis 49:24 of the so-called Bible, each of them, Theos or Deus, Lord, God, El or Allah and Jehovah Elohim, is merely \u201cmighty\u201d, NOT \u201cAll-Mighty\u201d. \r<br>5Therefore, NONE of them all (Theos or Deus, Lord, God, El or Allah and Jehovah Elohim) is the true All-Mighty Supreme Being. \r<br>6The true All-Mighty Supreme Being, who must be the First Being and Origin of all beings, good and evil, must be NO other than the First Matter (Mother), First Space and First Time whom the late peacemaking renowned scientist Stephen Hawking described as the Singularity (Oneness or Tawhid), a point or being of almost no size (Invisible but NOT spirit or breath) but of infinite mass and energy (Almighty) with whom the Universe (Unity) started to exist; \r<br>7The word \u201cAlmighty\u201d correctly means \u201cAll-Self-Sufficient\u201d; and \u201cAll-Self-Sufficient\u201d correctly means wanting, requiring, or needing and accepting NO help, NO service, NO ministry of any minister, NO servant angel Michael, Gabriel or Lucifer, NO help or service of any servant or abdul prophet Muhammad, Moses, Jesus, Nanak, Zoroaster or USA ta Mondomuni, NO zakats, NO tithes, NO ransom money for the souls, NO payments of vows, NO thanksgiving, NO worships, NO praises, NO sacrifices, NO sin offerings, NO atonements, NO religions\u2014yes, NOTHING from outside of Her own self in order to exist and to be satisfied, sufficient and happy (Psalms of David 40: 6 K JV). \r<br>Therefore, the true Supreme Being must be the only Self-Caused, Self- Evolved or Self-Created; \r<br>8Therefore, it must be a true truth that the true Supreme Being caused the birth (nature), existence and creation of the material (that is, mother-from) worlds NOT for Her own wants or needs and possessions, but rather for the wants or needs and common possessions of ALL Her non-all-mighty Natural Communist Creatures, Israelis or non-Israelis, good or evil. \r<br>9Note that to control and punish the evil ones, like those who comment or teach contradicting those true truths and true wisdoms I have revealed, must be the task or responsibility of all humans, including YouTube, but NOT to the true Supreme Being who has given to all of us the freedom of choosing and freedom of doing whatever we are able to choose and do, good or evil\u2014besides our natural everlasting life, it is an exchange for Her bringing us here into existence without our consent or agreement. \r<br>10Those true wisdoms of USA ta Mondomuni must be the bases of ALL the economic, political and social laws in our world to have true lasting love, happiness, unity, harmony, security, prosperity, justice, peace and order in our world. \r<br>11For more true wisdoms, Google also the true Holy Book; entitled:\r<br>\u2022\tSophiocracy [Wisdom-Government] Is the Highest Form of Democracy That Must Be Reached: The True Truths That Will Set You Free \r<br>of USA ta Mondomuni, and sing the song \u201cImagine\u201d of my fellow brilliant artist singer John Lennon. \r<br>\r<br>PART 74\r<br>The Miracles and Mental Problems in the Way to the True Truths and True Wisdoms for the True Lasting \r<br>World Peace and Order\r<br>1It is a true truth that there are NO shortcuts (such as miracles, healing, resurrection, splitting the sea or moon, ascending to heaven, dreams, hearing voices, seeing visions and God&#39;s revelations) in the way to the true truths unless the correct reasoning that is based on correct knowledge certifies them, as in 1+1=2.. \r<br>2Those people, who experienced auditory and visual hallucinations, like hearing or seeing Muhammad, Moses, Jesus, God or angel, firmly believed that they did not have mental disorders. It is by cause what they experienced were \u201cjust as real as if someone were standing next to them speaking\u201d and were \u201cexactly the same as if someone really were\u201d, according to The Everything Psychology Book written by Lynda L. Warrick, Ph. D. and Lesley Bolton published in 2004 by Adams Media, Avon, Massachusetts, USA. \r<br>3Just like Moses\u2019 and Muhammad\u2019s religion, atonements or sacrifices, Jesus\u2019 sacrifice, atonement or religion, where he used and abused his flesh and blood as a sin sacrifice or a sin offering, was surely NOT required, NOT needed NOR accepted by true Supreme Being who must be all-self-sufficient, that is, needing or accepting NOTHING from other\u2019s self in order to live an everlasting satisfied, sufficient and pleasant life. \r<br>4Even the supposed grandfather, King David Christ, of Jesus Christ, said about their supposed supreme being El or Jehovah Elohim or Theos: \r<br>\u2022 \u201cSacrifice and offering thou didst not desire [will]; mine ears has thou opened: burnt offering and sin offering hast thou not required.\u201d (Psalms 40:6 KJV.) \r<br>5Therefore, the inescapable truthful wise conclusion must be: \r<br>\u2022 That, like Muhammad, Moses was a fictitious and false and fools\u2019 servant prophet of an equally fictitious and false or fools\u2019 Supreme Being El or Allah, Yehovah Elohiym or Hashem; \r<br>\u2022 That even if we make true Jesus\u2019 false and fools\u2019 resurrection and ascension to heaven, they can NEVER certify his atonement or religion as good, required, needed and accepted by the true Supreme Being; \r<br>\u2022 That Jesus\u2019 false and fools\u2019 resurrection and ascension to heaven were merely used or abused to make his useless and evil religion (Christianity) appear good and necessary in the minds of mental patients; \r<br>\u2022 That I must be the troublemaker, true crazy fool, psychopathic liar and deceiver, like the Muhammadan imams, Jewish rabbis, Christian priests, pastors and ministers, if I will not tell you the true truth that, like Muhammad, Moses and Jesus were the troublemakers, true crazy fools, psychopathic liars and deceivers; \r<br>\u2022 That even seeing or hearing Muhammad, Moses and Jesus in person or in reality must be NOT beneficial to you or to humankind\u2014it must even be punishable by death by cause of the worst severity of Muhammad\u2019s, Moses\u2019 and Jesus\u2019 troublemaking communicable psychotropic lies and deceptions that can make the childish people crazy fools and terrorists.

How plain! Where is your rocket intelligence? Don\u2019t ever be deceived by the false (deceived) Ballot. Be Smarter than Smartmathic\u2014that is why I don&#39;t vote to use the wrong ballot and to be abused in stupid political system that is mainly and meanly based on troublemaking or on NOT peacemaking religious and political psychopathic lies and deceptions.\r<br>4Thus, plainly, the false Ballots in all Democratic Elections must be intended to deceive, \u201cscam, mislead, spam, or defraud\u201d their users, the political voters and candidates, the troublemaking criminal acts that are NOT \u201callowed on YouTube\u201d and must NOT also be allowed anywhere in our world for the sake of our true lasting love, happiness, unity, security, prosperity, justice, peace and order in this world. \r<br>5I tell you truly, if the True Ballots would be used to elect or select our political leaders in USA or in all over the world, there would be peace on Earth. \r<br>6Of course, it is just one of the wise things that we must do to change our troubled world into an untroubled world. \r<br>7For more true truths that will set you free from the dungeons of politics and dunghills of religions, Google one of USA ta Mondomuni&#39;s true Holy Books, entitled:\r<br>\u2022\tSophiocracy [Wisdom-Rule] Is the Highest Form of Democracy That Must Be Reached: The True Truths That Will Set You Free \r<br>to Light Up or Make Bright, your minds like mine, a former Jewish Christian mind, so that we could have Peace and Order in the noosphere of our world that can be easily kindled or set on fire to explode like a giant hydrogen bomb in a religious and political thermonuclear war. \r<br>PART 217\r<br>The Communist Economic-Social \r<br>Justice Must Be the Wise Solution of the Problems of Hungers and Wants, Peace and Order, Wars and Terrorisms: \r<br>Were the Earliest Christian \r<br>Communities Communist?\r<br> \t1Yea si, my beloved brethren and sisters! The earliest Christian communities were Communist, and the basis of their good morality was what you can read in Ecclesiastes chapter 5: verse 9 KJV, \u201cThe profit of the earth is for all.\u201d \r<br>2Read also the King James Version of the so-called Bible in the chapter entitled \u201cThe Community of the Believers [Christians]\u201d in The Acts of the Apostles chapter 2. \r<br>3In there we can read in verses 41 to 47 that \u201cthey [the earliest Christians] continued steadfastly in the apostles\u2019 [Communist] doctrine [that was, of course, the Communist doctrine of their Supremo Jesus Christ] . . . all that believed [in Jesus Christ or those who converted to Christianity] were together, and had all things COMMON.\u201d \r<br>4In chapter 4 of the same The Acts of the Apostles: verses 32 to 37, we can read that the earliest Christians \u201cwere of one heart and of one soul: neither said any of them that aught of the things which he possessed was his own; but they had all things COMMON. . . Neither was there among them that lacked.\u201d \r<br> \t5Can\u2019t you see what we, brilliant Karl Marx, Mao Tse-tung, Vladimir Lenn/Putin, Plato, Pythagoras and  USA ta Mondomuni, have long clearly seen? That was the good result of the Communism of the earliest Christians\u2014\u201cThere were no needy persons among them.\u201d(New International Version of the Bible) \r<br>6But look at now the Christians: \u201cThere are NO tithes-and-money-offering Christian persons among them who are not needy except their neighbors, robbery extortionist pastors, ministers, rabbis or leaders and founders who are false or not truly Christians.\u201d \r<br>7That is by cause, through psychopathic lies and deceptions, ignorance and stupidity, they became anti-Communists and they don\u2019t truly have communities: they only have yours-is-yours and mine-is-mine irrational selfishness. (But sadly \u201cyours-is-yours and mine-is-mine irrational selfishness\u201d is the \u201crational\u201d under the dome [doom] of Capitalism.)\r<br>8Etymologically, the words \u201ccommon\u201d and \u201ccommunity\u201d are from the Latin word \u201ccommunus\u201d, that is, \u201cwith task or duty\u201d. \r<br>9The very word \u201ccommunity\u201d literally means \u201ccommon or joint possession, liability, goal et cetera\u201d. \r<br>10\u201cCommunity\u201d is the \u201ccommon, joint or united states (itas) of possessions\u201d, that is, common or joint possessions of all lands or all natural recourses, which are the very Providence of our true all-loving Supreme Mother for the legitimate needs of all of us humans, good-looking or not good-looking. \r<br>11By those true truths we can clearly see that the anti-Communists have long been shamelessly robbing from us our foods and drinks or our natural commonwealth by which we can have normal, good, happy and peaceful lives. \r<br>12Thus, the anti-Communists or anti-Commonwealth stupid people have long been committing heinous and atrocious crimes against us poor people, the 97.5 percent of the world population, which have long been causing us hungers, wants, hardships, diseases and deaths and which, for the sake of justice, peace and order, they must also be punished with the 97.5 percent increased intensity of our hungers, wants, hardships, diseases and deaths.    \r<br>PART 218\r<br>USA\u2019s Atheism and Communism Based on Correct Reasons and Sciences Are the Best Solutions for the Problems of Peace and Order, Hungers and Wants, \r<br> Wars and Terrorisms\r<br>1One past midnight I, a non-vicious vegetarian since childhood, was eating bananas like an old monkey at a fruit market along EDSA after I did a singing performance in a pub house when I personally witnessed a dirty mad man who was sitting in front of a garbage basket, reasoning and arguing angrily with someone, who was invisible to my own non-hallucinating eyes, that he was not a mad man. \r<br>2It even confirmed my theory as a science that, by their mental disorders and wrong reasons, the fools don\u2019t know they are fools. \r<br>3There are so many kinds of fools or mad men and women in our world. All of them have thought disorders that are the common mental problems of all the conceited psychopaths and sociopaths. \r<br>4Ignorance is the chief cause of their thought disorders that is more psychotropic than the drugs, such as alcohol, marijuana and the opium of the people. \r<br>5The worst of those fools have been even revered as the wisest, righteous, gods, prophets, apostles, imams; rabbis, pastors, priests, popes, fathers et cetera. \r<br>6For the privatization of toothbrushes and toothpicks, there are so many reasons. \r<br>7For the privatization of lands or natural resources, there are also so many reasons. But what we normal people like are the correct reasons that are based on correct knowledges or sciences, like those used to reach the true truth or true wisdom that 1+1=2, NOT 1+1=1 (John 10:30). \r<br>8Indeed, it is correct knowledges or sciences: \r<br>\u2022 That we are all created equal . . . equal in possession of the whole world; \r<br>\u2022 That \u201cthe profit of the earth is for all\u201d. (Ecclesiastes 5:9 KJV\u2014it is a book of the Bible, containing thoughts about the wealth or riches of the earth, life and its meaning.) \r<br>\u2022 That every human being has the birthright to the full benefit of the Providence, that is, ALL the lands or natural resources, that are the Foreseeing love and care of our true All-Loving Supreme Mother over ALL of us Her beloved Children, Chinese or not Chinese, good or not good. (The Supreme Mother is the First Matter, First Space and First Time, the true Supreme Being, who is NOT the Dyaus (Theos) Pitar, that is, Sky Father, NOR God, NOR any of the supposed father supreme beings in any religion.)\r<br>\u2022 That in every second a human being is born in our world. \r<br>9It is the mental order and correct reasons, therefore: \r<br>\u2022 That even the perfectly equal partition and privatization of all lands or natural resources to all of us will only be wise and good in one second; \r<br>\u2022 That the privatization of lands or natural resources must be against our human nature and/or against the natural laws; \r<br>\u2022 That the privatization of lands or natural resources must be against the true wisdoms, wise ethics and correct reasons that are based on correct knowledges, or against logic, the science of sciences; \r<br>\u2022 That the privatization of lands or natural resources must be the stupidity that has been causing to most, if not to all of us, so much sufferings, hungers, hardships, poverties, terrorisms, wars and other disorders, including the mental and physical disorders; \r<br>\u2022 That, by international revolution, if not by international law, all the lands or natural resources must be declared the commonwealths and possessions of all of us humans\u2014it must be the true wisdom or wise ethics that can effectively solve the physical and mental disorders and other disorders, such as wars, terrorisms, poverties, hardships, hungers and so much sufferings. \r<br>10For more true truths about Communism and Capitalism, Google one of the true Holy Books of USA ta Mondomuni, entitled:\r<br>\u2022\tSophiocracy Is the Highest Form of \r<br>Democracy That Must Be Reached: The True Truths That Will Set You Free", "comment_date": "2022-02-22T02:03:02Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Not_LostYT", "comment_text": "Directions misunderstood; invaded norway", "comment_date": "2022-02-20T14:49:41Z", "likes_count": 2}, {"comment_by": "Mc kenly Hill", "comment_text": "can you example send to russia", "comment_date": "2022-02-20T06:21:34Z", "likes_count": 2}, {"comment_by": "Thesnakerox", "comment_text": "I visited the Titan Missile Museum, which is where this video was filmed, myself some time after watching it.

Same can be said of the Soviets, the French, English, Chinese, Indians, Pakistanis, and Isrealis..   Why would any government be so full of itself to create a doomsday machine to protect its version of how human society should exist? Why?  We need to stop treating nuclear dooms day machines as if they were interesting engineering constructs.  We need to start treating them for what they are: Doomsday machines that reflect the psychotic nature of temporary forms of human power.  That is it.  To take all the brilliance of science and engineering and build a doomsday machine that will end life for all people, across the whole world because the US or the Soviets think their governments are more important than human life is the definition of madness.

The butterfly valve lock. As far as I&#39;m concerned, that&#39;s the most important safety feature on the whole site to prevent unauthorized or unintentional launches. \r<br>\r<br>The first stage engine has two thrust chambers, and both thrust chambers have two feed lines. One feed line is for fuel, and the other feed line is for the oxidizer. All four of those lines are equipped with butterfly valves, and all four of those butterfly valves need to be open for that missile to fly. \r<br>\r<br>The first thrust chamber&#39;s oxidizer feed line butterfly valve has a lock on it.\r<br>\r<br>In order to unlock it, you need to enter a secret code that came in with the 35-character coded launch order that you received. It&#39;s the first and only time that you EVER knew what that code was. There&#39;s six thumbwheels, and sixteen characters on each one. So that&#39;s 16^6, which means there are slightly less than 16 million 800 thousand possible combinations, and only one works. Now those sound like pretty good odds, right? \r<br>\r<br>Well, the Air Force didn&#39;t like taking any chances, evidenced by the fact that they put in a tries counter.\r<br>\r<br>In order to prevent any kind of tampering, they put in a lifetime-spanning tries counter. You could only get the combination wrong six times. This tries counter NEVER reset. On the seventh attempt, even if you got it right, the entire computer system was programmed to commit an electronic suicide. After that, it would take at least two hours with many technicians to bring the computer system back to an active status, and they would have to reset the mechanically-operating tries counter manually.\r<br>\r<br>If that ever happened while you were on duty as commander?

Those of us old enough to remember paper punch cards well they used a paper punch tape for those early computers.

Land based ICBM&#39;s are low on the triad, just like B-52, B-1B, and B-2 nuclear bomber bases. The problem is, their location is known. The Soviets/Russians had/have them targeted. Bombers take a little time for crews to get their gear, run to the planes, start up, taxi to the active, take off, then accelerate, and climb fast, so they can increase their distance from the base, so when it&#39;s hit, the blast wave won&#39;t knock them out of the sky. And who knows how many warheads will rain down around the airbases. It&#39;s bad enough that bomber pilots have to pull their curtains, or dark helmet visors, so as to not be blinded by nearby bursts, in the presence of commercial, and general, air traffic. Air traffic who&#39;s pilots will be blinded. Then they become unguided air hazzards. Land ICBM&#39;s have to be launched quickly if a first strike is incoming. Russia&#39;s new nuclear rocket powered missiles, that may include stealth material, that can approach the US from the less protected south, could possibly hit Minuteman silo&#39;s, or USAF nuclear bases, before they can get all, or any, of their assets off the ground. Now nuclear subs are iffy, they can hide, but even some of them have, or are, being tracked by fast attack subs, with faster torpedoes, especially when the boomers approach an enemy&#39;s coasts for a 10-15 minute missile flight time to target. Advantage, counter advantage, one of war&#39;s most basic concepts. The Russians know this which is why they&#39;re developing those missiles. The US needs to worry less about placing THAAD, and EWR, systems in Poland, and S Korea, and start placing them in the southern regions of Florida, Louisiana, Texas, Arizona, New Mexico, California, maybe even Puerto Rico. Maybe the USG could work an agreement with Mexico, but security with the cartels would be difficult, unless we arrange to buy a lot more coke, etc, from them... Whoops, that&#39;s a secret.

Those 7 megatons were needed to ensure the warhead could be used as a counter-weapon asset, to knock out soviet nuclear silos. As the warheads couldn&#39;t be guaranteed to land near enough the targetted silo, they needed to be ourageously powerful to compensate for it, so a hit landing farther than expected would still guarantee a 100% chance of knocking out the target.<br><br>And that&#39;s because Titan II wasn&#39;t a deterrent for MAD.  It wasn&#39;t the US strategic weapon of choice to counter-attack after the enemy had delivered a first strike. Those would&#39;ve been SAC&#39;s strategic bomber fleet and short/medium range ballistic missiles (such as Jupiter first, then Pershing, etc) and (later on) the US Navy first generation of SSBN and SLBMs (Poseidon). But not Titan II.<br><br>Titan II was a true first-strike capable delivery vehicle and it&#39;s job was that of a first-strike delivery vector. Not deterrance. First strike. It was the weapon that would be used to attack first, and it&#39;s job was to destroy as many soviet silos as they could to, precisely, deny the soviets the ability to strike back in the very way the man in the video says Titan would do if the US was attacked.<br><br>And Titan II&#39;s warhead was so powerful because of the job it had to do. Later advancements on inertial navigation, missile guidance, and MIRV technology ensured circular error probabilities of less than a couple hundred meters, more than close enough to guarantee silo destructions with far less nominal yields. <br>At that stage multi-megaton warheads were not needed anymore and instead were substituted in the next generation of ICBMs (the Minuteman missile and later on the MX) by payloads with several independent reentry warheads with yields in the area of 500kt (14 times lower than the 7MT in Titan II) - and they still were not only more efficient at their job of counter-weapon (thanks to their larger precission) but allowed for each missile to attack several targets, thus multiplying the number of soviet silos that could be struck on a first attack. Meanwhile the very same advancements in guidance, navigation and accuracy turned the SSBN fleet in yet another first-strike capable force once the Trident missile was deployed.<br><br>As a further note, those missiles were NOT reprogrammable. At least not during an emergency. One of the specific purposes and targets of the MX program was to give the US a missile fleet which targets could be reprogrammed easily (we&#39;re talking that with MX they were aiming to achieve in the range of maybe half a day to reprogram the whole missile fleet target selection, and that was in the 80s. Titan II was 60s tech). Titan II could take days (if not weeks) to be rewired for a different target. You couldn&#39;t send it to any other place than it&#39;s intended target on the fly on a whim. Certainly not once enemy ICBMs had been detected incoming. At that point you just launched them at their designated targets, nd their targets weren&#39;t soviet cities. They were soviet silos. Furthening the proof that Titan II was a first strike vector, not a &quot;deterrance&quot; asset.<br><br>Later on Minuteman allowed for each missile to have a hard-wired selection of maybe half a dozen several targets. You could swap from one to another much faster, but still couldn&#39;t be done &quot;on the fly&quot; (meaning, once an incoming attack was detected, at which point you only had maybe 30 minutes to launch back before being struck). Still not enough to be used as deterrant: the whole US Minuteman ICBM force was targetted at soviet silos, not cities, and was as much a first strike asset as Titan had been before it.<br> <br>That missile wasn&#39;t a counterattack asset. The US ICBM force was, by design, a first strike asset. Deterrance was left for other weapons and branches of the military. I pass no judgement on it, the US needed a nuclear arsenal for that particular job and deployed that missile, the same the soviet depoyed their own first-strike nuclear delivery forces. It&#39;s an abject role as being the agressor in a nuclear war is morally repugnant...but still it was a role that needed filling at the time. The Cold War was real, the possibility of a nuclear war was VERY real, and the US needed first strike capability to remain in the race and not be left behind. Titan did fill it, as later on Minuteman, MX and Trident went on to fill it. They were necessary evils, but were evil weapons with an evil role nonetheless, not the &quot;morally acceptable&quot; counterstrike &quot;we would&#39;ve only used it had we been struck first&quot; fairy tale we&#39;re told in this video. That&#39;s a plain, bold, and dirty lie.<br><br>And I don&#39;t like it.

My understanding is that each group of Titan II silos had several launch control centers.

During this delay, all of the control centers would receive an alarm indicating that a launch was initiated by one of the centers. During those few minutes, any of the launch control centers could abort the launch sequence. The idea was that a normal launch would require unanimous agreement across all the launch control centers. If any of the centers were destroyed or the 2-man crew inside incapacitated, then the launch would still proceed but with a short delay. However, any surviving center could abort a launch in progress during the delay.", "comment_date": "2019-03-28T23:15:26Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "animi bml ninja", "comment_text": "\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u00bb", "comment_date": "2019-03-27T22:14:41Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Flippy", "comment_text": "this is a nuke: i this is the explosion OOOO<br>R.i.p world", "comment_date": "2019-03-26T19:07:05Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "F.B.I", "comment_text": "Bears driving a plane over an area and hoping the blast zone doesn\u2019t reach you", "comment_date": "2019-03-26T07:53:20Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "M\u00f4rs\u00edne", "comment_text": "We&#39;re from Iran, thank you so much, we may launch our missile using your tutorial now. have a nice day", "comment_date": "2019-03-24T19:48:15Z", "likes_count": 4}, {"comment_by": "ZXBLIZZARD", "comment_text": "i guess i gotto fetch my friend for this job", "comment_date": "2019-03-24T18:10:10Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Doctor Bronze", "comment_text": "welcome to october 23 2077", "comment_date": "2019-03-24T15:38:41Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "stocchinet", "comment_text": "Instructions unclear, just started WW3", "comment_date": "2019-03-24T12:09:05Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "DE7AULT", "comment_text": "*Kim Jong Un wants to know your  location.<br><br>Allow<br><br>Deny*", "comment_date": "2019-03-24T01:06:48Z", "likes_count": 8}, {"comment_by": "hulaluuyaa", "comment_text": "it&#39;s all creepy...", "comment_date": "2019-03-23T19:14:26Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Matthew Chin", "comment_text": "Hiroshima was the little boi, this one&#39;s the big boi", "comment_date": "2019-03-23T17:07:30Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "DeadPan", "comment_text": "<b>Kim Jong Un wants to know your location</b>", "comment_date": "2019-03-23T10:22:28Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "michael fox", "comment_text": "<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knDIENvBTgw&amp;t=1m27s\">1:27</a> &quot;Sure&quot; it&#39;s no longer there!", "comment_date": "2019-03-22T23:12:47Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "michael fox", "comment_text": "This is a cool as video!", "comment_date": "2019-03-22T23:11:30Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "michael fox", "comment_text": "Stupid me<br>..<br>Now I know why mine didn&#39;t live up to its expectations!", "comment_date": "2019-03-22T23:10:23Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Watty", "comment_text": "thank you now I can launch my spare nuclear missile in my backyard", "comment_date": "2019-03-22T16:49:09Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "ethan chen", "comment_text": "How to deliver democracy", "comment_date": "2019-03-22T13:16:25Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Multorum Unum", "comment_text": "Where are we waiting for?", "comment_date": "2019-03-22T11:21:45Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Jason Gallant", "comment_text": "Yeah and everyone has these things now", "comment_date": "2019-03-22T04:23:57Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "ryan Mosey", "comment_text": "Damn am I glad that nukes have never been used after WWII", "comment_date": "2019-03-21T18:19:49Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "the abecedarian", "comment_text": "abu hajaar is rolling in Arizona desert.", "comment_date": "2019-03-21T15:35:56Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "LeOndaz", "comment_text": "I&#39;m supposed to be studying", "comment_date": "2019-03-21T04:28:45Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "chip67art", "comment_text": "I didn&#39;t know they used hippies to launch missiles.", "comment_date": "2019-03-20T10:33:18Z", "likes_count": 81}, {"comment_by": "breakfast", "comment_text": "Al Qaeda says thanks", "comment_date": "2019-03-20T00:13:30Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "the Legit", "comment_text": "how do they select targets?

I&#39;m aware of one near DIA in Colorado that might be a candidate. The batteries to power the on-board missile system was particularly ingenious. They used gravity fed electrolytics that would be poured into the anode case when the bags holding them would be punctured. In seconds you had a charged battery ready for use - that would never leak or degrade indefinitely - keeping the battery viable - forever (because it was assembled at time-of-use). My father worked on a variant of the Titan II (he worked on 3 nuclear missile systems altogether, including a defensive interceptor or AMM). The Titan II was a single-warhead design. Later missiles including the MX were MIRV capable launching a platform that would park in orbit and scan targets for multiple secondary warhead deliveries. Megatons of fun. Finally, early astronauts riding on re-purposed nuclear missiles found their GEICOs would at orbit be &#39;hunting&#39; for targets. The pilot of the spacecraft would have to override the  desire to nose-down for re-entry (until purpose-built rockets were developed for future spacecraft).", "comment_date": "2019-01-27T12:44:15Z", "likes_count": 47}, {"comment_by": "Anthony Bush", "comment_text": "If your watching this the fbi will be visiting you very soon", "comment_date": "2019-01-27T09:35:39Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "durianhead", "comment_text": "god this video is terrifying", "comment_date": "2019-01-27T08:09:57Z", "likes_count": 2}, {"comment_by": "Jhon Smith", "comment_text": "If you launch the nuke without authorization you&#39;ll have to awnser to the coca cola corporation", "comment_date": "2019-01-27T00:58:49Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Arpit Chhabra", "comment_text": "Thanks,got much information in that.", "comment_date": "2019-01-26T18:33:57Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "blue Mac 1", "comment_text": "We call it mutual destruction!

NATO force are making their forces close to russia border their aim is clear to invade russia and to control it during nuclear war but russia has more than 20 million reserved forces so those forces should keep their country on the border during nuclear war. i also propose that russia must prepare small scale guided nuclear missile that can launch from air to strike air craft carriers.and to make air defense system using submarines to strike military transport planes,and fighters in the sea (atlantic ocean) .since the period of nuclear war is short every body must be as fast as possible.", "comment_date": "2017-01-06T19:12:27Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "YoungHetero", "comment_text": "This video should be called &quot;how to get on the FBI watch list&quot;", "comment_date": "2017-01-06T18:56:34Z", "likes_count": 2}, {"comment_by": "Augustus", "comment_text": "But wouldn&#39;t you have to select the target?", "comment_date": "2017-01-04T18:14:17Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "vortech ysi", "comment_text": "Once you start a nuclear war there is  no way to stop and go back.

It just shows the very last action. For a start you cannot have a fully fueled ICBM just sat in the silo 24/7. The fuel is way too volatile for that, and various factors, such as temperature, corrosion, and degradation means it is impossible. Just as it would be impossible to have a fully fueled Apollo mission sat permanently at Kennedy Space Station. The missile needs to be fueled first, which would only happen across the board in a DEFCON 1, or maybe DEFCON 2. Other than that, nearly all the continental based nuclear weapons sit unfueled. That is why a pre-emptive strike is considered a possibility, and why air launched, and submarine launched systems exist. Air launched can simply be dropped, and submarines get much closer to the target, which means rocket delivery systems are not necessary, but they use delivery systems similar to cruise missiles. So relatively few ICBM&#39;s can be launched immediately in normal day to day times. Secondly, and for similar reasons, all nuclear missiles cannot be permanently ready because of the warhead. The material required for a nuclear weapon is both unstable, and highly explosive.  There is a whole industry, a subsidiary of the nuclear energy industry, that is continuously, preparing warheads. The assembly and fitting procedure is all done last minute. Another reason why in peace time relatively few ICBM&#39;s are operational at any one time. And the reason nuclear energy industries in some countries upsets the major powers. This necesitated a huge nuclear arsenal, which alongside interception calculations, lead to a situation called overkill. Maintaining that arsenal, given the problems I have explained is also prohibitively expensive. Counter measures are a lot cheaper.

So much hype over nuclear bombs being associated with fission reactors, and how fusion will be the way of the clean future, but nobody seemingly ever points out that virtually every nuclear weapon ever deployed was a fusion weapon.<br>It is also interesting so little is made of why we chose thermal neutron reactors over fast neutron reactors too - its very clear that the fast neutron projects were shut down because they just dont produce material for nuclear weapons, if that hadnt been a concern we would have had dozens of times less waste that was dangerous for hundreds of times shorter time.<br>It is very sad that thermal neutron tech and nuclear weapons (and some incredibly poor designs) have poisoned public thinking against nuclear technology at a time when we desperately need it. We should be doing all we can now to get fast neutron reactors up and running re-using existing waster to power our transition over long term to renewables.

This changes depending on the power cycle of the country you&#39;re in and when in Europe a lot of the current is 50hz there so you&#39;d have to change your shutter speed to 1/50 or a divisible fraction of it.

I think that the bigger influence had the Soviet declaration of War and the immense pressure they put on the japanese forces in China (Manchuria) and the impending invasion of japanese homeland. As the japanese emperor back in the day was still like a demigod for the people and the military they tried until the very end to bring themselves into a better position to negotiate terms of surrender as the unconditional surrender the U.S.A. had issued included that the removal of their emperor which for japan was hardly acceptable and tried to the very end (unknowing that the soviet union which had not renewed the neutrality pact) actually agreed to enter war against japan)<br>As they faced the fact that they would probably not get any better conditions they faced an invasion of two forces on their homeland probably leading to a split of the homeland.
