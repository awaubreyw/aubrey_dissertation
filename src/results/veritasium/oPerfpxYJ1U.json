I&#39;m pretty sure that would b more acceptable idea to those with pets already paralysed, been given a chance to advance medical tech &amp; getting a loved pet to walk again, I know that&#39;s said more from a human point of view &amp; thinking but many animal lovers would leap at the chance to help a paralysed pet, advancing med tech is a bonus!

The solution seemed similar, an injection with a mix of stem cells, some other proteins, some other agents, and the body would by itself regenerate, creating that new \u00abconnections\u00bb and the brain would just be needed to rewire all the new information from the new stimulus with the place where now the brain was understanding them. Like for example, before if you would touch a leg and the brain would recognize it it a back side, now, with the new wiring it would understand it with the front opposite side (just an example), but, even though recognizing it with new places in the brain, it would perform the same stuff, after therapy, like to relearn to walk again, but with a fully function machine, or connection, in the spinal cord.<br><br>Which show was that? Anyone else watched it? I believe they also mentioned the technology to grow a human ear in mice, same technology, different end result, with the mix in the injection pointing to grow cartilage instead of neurons...<br><br>For quite some years I&#39;m trying to discover that show.

What does this say about the new morality of our zeitgeist.

Intentionally severing healthy rats&#39; spinal cords? That&#39;s truly disgusting! Do you know so little of rats that you are you unaware that many male elderly rats are naturally susceptible to hind leg paralysis? Why not use these rats for your studies? That would be both humane &amp; practical, but this is just gross. Everyone is so excited at this &quot;amazing&quot; discovery but no one is the least bit disturbed about the animal, whose spine has been severed, is strapped in a harness, has an electrode stimulant directly attached to its brain, &amp; is forced to (albeit involuntarily) walk, run &amp; stand in an upright position on a treadmill.

It not like inducing motivation has to happen in a lab. If they can support the weight of a paralyzed person, they could start right away. <br>But I imagine that it would be difficult to motivate so strongly a person, and that is why we cannot yet consistently test this. <br>(*Added later. But then again, there are cases where doctors thought recovery, the ability to walk, or to talk, impossible based off physical data and observance, and yet a person makes a recovery though sheer will and effort. Motivated drive and making a decision (to not give up).)<br>Its easier to motivate a rat (with chocolate though instincts) but how to motivate so strongly a human? <br>But because they can synthesize hormones, smells, tastes, brain chemicals, its not like they can&#39;t simulate something desirable. Perhaps that &quot;chocolate&quot; may not physically exist, only a mere representation of it, but they can make the person believe that it is real through smells, tastes, or chemicals that induce something desirable, or something worth motivating oneself for. Perhaps, 4D virtual reality, or AR will have a place for this. To simulate (however artificially) something desirable. <br>A Rat&#39;s motivation or decision to want to walk is due to instinctual drives (no choice but to follow instinct).<br>Whereas Humans have instinctual drives too, but &quot;chocolate&quot; wouldn&#39;t necessary cut it. Because humans have instincts but by choice, humans have the ability to not follow instincts. Where perhaps the difficulty and complexity arises. The motivating factor, unless not induced by chemicals to stimulate specific areas of the brain as desirable and feel-good, what motivates a person will differ in form. However the chemicals involved will be the same in varying degrees. <br>If then, the problem really becomes.... Not everyone has what motivates them to the extent of complete exertion of ones being so much so as to decide to move ones legs even if physically, we think that we can&#39;t move them. In other words, choosing and deciding supra-rationally. Making a decision against what we see or think. <br><br>For a Rat, &quot;chocolate&quot; is the best thing that it has ever tasted or most likely can taste in its life. <br>Chocolate contains phenylethylamine which can raise levels of endorphins, the pleasure-giving substances, in the brain. Therefore, this may be what is causing a Rat to desire chocolate. Stimulating the strong motivation. <br>Chocolate may not necessarily work for a human, but possibly if it were these phenylethylamines or something for that person, subjectively or objectively raises endorphins in the brain for a human being that could be the object that a human can strongly aspire to reach. <br>Though I think that the same parts of the brain no matter who, would be stimulated in varying degrees, (this being an objective response, and how the human is created ) but the form that stimulates those responses in the brain will be relative to each individual person.<br><br>The natural way for a human would be for that person to find what he is wiling to supera-rationally exert himself for. Or even the search itself can be the supra-rational motivating factor. <br>An artificial way to going about this, would be by inducing via the things that cause those responses in the brain through simulation. However, unless that person themselves supra-rationally decides to, no amount of brain inducing chemicals, or stimulating specific regions in the brain would be able to influence their decision.<br><br>But, as this Rat needs an outside influence, or be stimulated, help to motivate what is within [making ones own decision, either to walk or not walk] , so can we hugely benefit, better yet the world would be such a better place if we as humans were to encourage and help motivate one another, exactly (albeit for a human) as this person is exerting effort in trying any thing they possibly can to motivate that Rat to move forward. <br>We desperately need to.", "comment_date": "2019-03-23T14:55:46Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Tan Vorn", "comment_text": "Who else\u2019s spine hurts after watching this?", "comment_date": "2019-03-23T06:20:11Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Bof", "comment_text": "Women holds choclate infront of paralyzed rat to get it to walk again.", "comment_date": "2019-03-22T23:16:45Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "June Sept", "comment_text": "In the future, the rats will be walking with its  two legs.", "comment_date": "2019-03-22T12:49:13Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "not sure what to put here yet", "comment_text": "I&#39;m clicking off now cuz you are severing the rats&#39; spinal cords... that&#39;s just terrible. would you want someone to sever your spinal cord for research", "comment_date": "2019-03-19T05:54:15Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "YamiZee", "comment_text": "Paralyzing a rat is morally wrong.", "comment_date": "2019-03-19T01:11:44Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Unknown Truth", "comment_text": "7 years later , what happened?", "comment_date": "2019-03-19T00:54:19Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Biomika", "comment_text": "If we have to hurt a sentient being to discover something new, means we are far from being good scientists.", "comment_date": "2019-03-18T20:13:38Z", "likes_count": 4}, {"comment_by": "GyroMurphy", "comment_text": "I knew this would have massive down votes before watching..

I do think as a whole that the animals should be treated better &amp; there are ways that can be done inexpensively.  &amp; should be implemented. Yes it bothered me watching this knowing that poor rat was purposely paralyzed,but if humans really ( No open ended funding for no progress experiments or ones that are questionalble or that do the same experiment when the result is a known thing ) benefit &amp; labs improve the subjects treatment then I cant complain. The rats I got were sold as FEEDERS, so they&#39;ve been rescued from becoming reptile food &amp; I treat them like royalty &amp; show them limitess effection,even to the 1 who just refuses to try to stop biting me,as I realize she had to live in a tiny fish tank @ the store &amp; watched 2 litters of babies all get taken away, then she got sold to me pregnant &amp; I had to give away a bunch, I had 7 of them though, they do die of old age but I take care of her regardless that she&#39;s had to learn humans are shitty( thank god all her kids I raised are affectionate as all hell ) &amp; labs should do the same for test animals. I admit that when its no longer neccessary to use these beings in tests Ill be happy. So unless youre saving same creature from the fate of being food or a test subject &amp; really takig care of it yourself, stop demandingthe labs stop ( they wont ) &amp; start demanding better treatment for the animals that do have to be tested on.

MICE. They talked about how this could POTENTIALLY be a HUGE STEP forward in the treatment of humans, and so on, only to conclude the segment by saying that it is uncertain if this method will ever make it into medical TRIAL.

Remeber, it is sad that they do this to rats, but it is not for fun, it is for the good of all humanity, curing paralysis, cancer, understanding animals, learning about our own mind and body, etc, and if we can help ourselves survive, then that in return will help us, help rats, and every animal on earth. I LOVE animals, and hate animal abuse, but lets all be honest, the existence and survival of the entire human race is more important than the suffering of a few rats. The outcome and result is what matters, lets not be shallow and react instantly to what others do , we must take the time to think about the result of what happens, think about if it will be beneficial or reasonable.

For example, just to make a point, it would, although morally difficult, be worth it to conduct research involving animal cruelty in order to make medical advances that could potentially save thousands of human lives.<br><br>You could of course argue that humans could consent to taking part in experiments with medical purposes, but in some cases nobody would consent, but the result (saving thousands of people) would still be worth the animal cruelty in question. On a side note, humans have since the dawn of intelligence and technology been, to some degree involuntary, testing out medicine (in the form of plants, animal extracts, etc.) to find out what works and what doesn&#39;t, often resulting in the ones not working (and the ones working, but with side effects) causing pain, death and other negative effects that instead animals are subject to today.<br><br>As a thought experiment; you are in a room with a rat and not much else, and in a cage next to the room, there are 1000 people that are going to die unless you perform various experiments on the rat, some of them causing large amounts of pain. I believe that most people would do as instructed in order to save the humans in the cage.<br><br>Then, imagine the experiment, but with a restrained human in addition to the rat, and with the same instructions except that you could choose whether to perform the tasks on the rat or on the human. This would be a lot more complicated, since the human for example could consent to the cruelty you were forced to subject to either of the subjects, but I still think that the rat would be the option many people would go for in either case, with or without the human consenting to the cruelty.<br><br>This is a very simple comparison to how animal testing works. It&#39;s bad and it&#39;s cruel, but it&#39;s still necessary and worth it.<br><br>Also, just so people remember; animals in nature don&#39;t have very good lives. They are subject to starvation, fear, sickness, injuries, and a lot of other horrible experiences, and virtually no wild animlas die from natural causes, especially not after living happy lives. There is also the question of how aware they actually are of pain etc., as we don&#39;t know much about the conciousness of animals. Perhaps they don&#39;t experience pain the same way we do, since their primary reason for not wanting to experience pain (which potentially leads to them dying) is the fear of not being able to further their own genetic material. If their conciousness allowed them to decide, I think that being subjected to cruelty similar to the one they would find in nature anyway, but while having access to food and water, could be a tempting option for many animals, even though it seems horrible when you first think about it.", "comment_date": "2016-09-08T22:26:52Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "natalie Ditsel", "comment_text": "You are bad people", "comment_date": "2016-09-08T19:49:21Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Zoken", "comment_text": "mdr le fran\u00e7ais qui parle anglais", "comment_date": "2016-09-04T17:57:29Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "chakra", "comment_text": "People who feel sorry for rats should know that this helps in advancing medicine.

It is also quite clear that the level of consciousness of a rat is nowhere near that of a human. So in my ethics, torture of an animal is wrong, but killing it without making it hurt isn&#39;t that bad, because in my ethics you need consciousness to have a right to life.<br><br>When you decide to be a vegan or a vegetarian or be against animal experimentation, don&#39;t do it just out of empathy.

It just goes to show the &quot;dumbing down&quot; of society and skewing of priorities is rife these days. Any person leaving a comment in protest who eats meat is of the idiotic self righteous feeble minded type.  Mammalian  studies for medicine yield invaluable data for scientists and have, through the course of history improved the lives of countless people. Tell the 30 year old paralyzed father  of two and  his wife that there will be no further developments toward the eradication of paralysis because the rat, that will live an average of two years and that is often exterminated as a disease carrying  pest  is more important than his quality of life and family. Also start a movement to end all pest control for the rights of the rats so that we can see break outs of mass plagues and contaminated food supplies and living quarters in urban areas again from history These people totally ignore the implications of this amazing development in medicine to express their self righteousness. The important thing is that the rat was treated humanly and with care. A rat being exterminated for pest control would not have been given such considerations so if your really passionate about the well being of the rats and not the people that this research can help, start your campaign there , find rat invested areas and  adopt them into your homes before they are subjected to pest control measures. All life is precious and deserves respect but to see so many people totally ignore such an  amazing breakthrough  and new hope for their fellow man just to focus on a rat is an insult to all the people suffering from these injuries and afflictions.", "comment_date": "2016-07-02T15:33:22Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "jenna johnston", "comment_text": ":)  i am so glad they are helping the rats", "comment_date": "2016-07-01T15:32:45Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Jeanvier Goveia", "comment_text": "I support testing on animals to improve animals&#39; and humans&#39; health.", "comment_date": "2016-06-30T15:48:32Z", "likes_count": 17}, {"comment_by": "Erik Carter", "comment_text": "In the end there will be cake", "comment_date": "2016-06-30T06:57:28Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Just another rat lover", "comment_text": "This is horrific... that poor rat.... :O :(", "comment_date": "2016-06-28T07:22:58Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Sawan Challani", "comment_text": "why am i watching this", "comment_date": "2016-06-27T12:05:55Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "S.
