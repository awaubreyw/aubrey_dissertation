I was amazed how little most people know about how a sailboat works. Maybe other people want to jump in on my explanation but I explain it simply my saying that a sailboat can do more than just go downwind because it has a keel. With a keel the boat is like it is on railroad tracks and does not move sideways. The sail can be used to blow the boat down wind and obviously more and more degrees off of directly downwind because it has a keel. As the wind is 90 degrees off one side the sail can be used as a wing and make lift 90 degrees off the wing surface and move the boat forward and the keel prevents the boat from sliding sideways. Now you could see that this technique could be used to go a few degrees upwind and may a few more degrees and a few more degrees... You can keep doing this to about roughly 45 degrees into the wind. You can not go directly up wind. I hope this helps and is a very simplified explanation of how a sailboat works.", "comment_date": "2022-04-28T15:57:56Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Daan Bos", "comment_text": "Whit the wind is actually one of the slowest<br>Because the sail is only pushing the boat forward instead of pulling it forward", "comment_date": "2022-04-20T18:58:09Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "ShootSmarter", "comment_text": "Your first video that makes no sense.

But the linked video talking about how a wing works helps to some extent.<br>There are a number of papers on how sails work, but the one I like explain sailing like air being forced in a direction combined with the Coand\u0103 effect.<br>The paper describes how low air pressure is not what moves the boat forward, the explanation against low air pressure centers on the fact that there is nothing stopping the air in front of the boat from filling in the supposed low air pressure. The paper explains that the shape of the sails and the angle the air hits the leading edge plays the biggest role.  <br>The real reason I like the paper mentioned above is it explains the motion of the boat like its a rocket, okay that&#39;s my interpretation, but the paper describes the deflection of the air to the back of the boat like it is throwing mass behind like a rocket. The Coand\u0103 effect only enhances the effect because the air that sticks to the front side of the sails also swings through the sail&#39;s curve to be ejected behind the boat. When I started seeing the sails as mass diverters as opposed to wings I started to notice that the front sail on boat is normally setup to push air behind the main sail. It made me think of air entrained like one of the circular Dyson fans. The air on a front sail catches air and deflects it into a gap about 3 feet wide increasing the ejected mass of air behind the boat. The paper explained that the Newtonian and Coand\u0103 effect followed experience and it gave me a different view on why sail shape and &quot;triming&quot; was such an art.", "comment_date": "2021-03-05T05:58:05Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Poly Hexamethyl", "comment_text": "So the conclusion from this video seems to be that the fastest point of sailing is close hauled into the wind.

As the wind provides a pressure gradient between both sides of the sail, the force exerted generated by the lift is somewhat parallel to the of the boats boom. Why does this not cause the boat to drift off in that direction? The center board that protrudes the bottom of the hull causes an opposite effect to take place. The force with the wind opposes the force in the water, which is stationary. The two forces can be visualized as vectors on a vector diagram. These two forces create a resultant vector, in the direction in which the boat moves, which is a single component representing the effect of all other present vectors. For those of you who know sailing, you might know now why a broad reach (135\u00b0 from oncoming wind) is the fastest point of sail, not because of the wind behind generally behind the sail, but because the vectors point nearer to the direction of motion (increasing the value of the resultant) than at any other point of sail.", "comment_date": "2020-04-06T21:20:43Z", "likes_count": 17}, {"comment_by": "Ani Asofiei", "comment_text": "He is teasing the dumb", "comment_date": "2020-03-23T17:03:34Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Lord Habitaxe of Prydonia", "comment_text": "Would bale more sense when the boat is like them caravels or smth", "comment_date": "2020-02-26T13:35:46Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "ReviewGuy", "comment_text": "this is all incorrect. people in the past have no idea how sailing works you just do it with feel. sailing in a way is like magic nobody knows how it works so you pray to neptune everything goes well on the high seas.", "comment_date": "2020-01-31T19:07:12Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "radwizard", "comment_text": "Normal Force the Unsung Hero.", "comment_date": "2020-01-23T23:50:22Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Graham Charles", "comment_text": "This is a promising start (love the vox pops) but ultimately not very good explanation.

(relative to the sail). A sailboat takes advantage of the difference in the speed of the wind versus the speed of the water, which assuming a steady wind, is independent of the sail boat&#39;s speed. <br><br>The key component of the sails diversion of flow is that it diverts a relative crosswind (relative to the sail boat) backwards,  which coexists with a forwards force exerted onto the sail (which in turn exerts a forward force to the sail boat).  For a given true wind speed relative to the water, then the crosswind relative to a sail boat is the sin of the angle  between the path of the sail boat and the path of the true wind,  and this crosswind is independent of the sailboats speed. <br><br>For sailing upwind, the more efficient the sail boat, the smaller the angle between the boats path and the wind&#39;s  path, and the smallest angle for a specific sail boat is called &quot;beta&quot;. The fastest speed (with respect to the water) occurs when the sail boat travels at 90 degrees across the wind and &quot;beta&quot; degrees downwind.  Remember the crosswind (relative to the boat) is independent of the sail boats speed and only depends on the sail boat&#39;s heading with respect to the wind.<br><br>Very efficient sail boats like catamarans can &quot;outrun&quot; the wind, meaning their net downwind component of speed can be faster than the true wind speed. The Americas cup catamarans can achieve net downwind speed faster than 1.5 x true wind speed both downwind and upwind. Although the sail boat &quot;outruns&quot; the wind it&#39;s currently in, the wind ahead of the boat has a head start and the boat continues to sail into a continuous supply of crosswind, again regardless of the sail boats speed.<br><br>Somewhat related, what is known as a directly downwind faster than the wind (DDWFTTW) land craft, drives a propeller with it&#39;s wheels and can go faster than the wind that propels it.

Anyone can see that sails aren&#39;t shaped like wings, and there&#39;s no significant difference in distance the air needs to go on each side (they&#39;re just sheets of canvas!).  The sails work simply because the wind hitting them is deflected by a certain amount.  This means the wind experiences a force, and so the sails get the same force by Newton&#39;s third law.  Because the sail is effectively a &#39;reflector&#39; of wind, the net force on the sail is normal to the sail (ignoring drag; drag brings the direction of the net force backwards a bit).  The normal to the sail always points at least slightly forwards so there is always a component of force from the sails that points forwards.  The keel and rudder are there to react to as much of the sideways component as possible.  The difference in pressure is an equivalent explanation, but it makes no attempt to explain the origin of the pressure difference.<br><br>Which direction is fastest is actually is far more nuanced than just a single number.  For an average cruising boat, the best angle is probably around 110-130 degrees to the wind, but for a racing boat this angle is larger.  For an ice yacht (these experience almost no forwards drag from the ground, but don&#39;t slip sideways like boats do on water), this angle will approach 180 degrees.  This is because any wind the boat makes (called apparent wind) will tend to decrease the relative wind angle, because any apparent wind must come from 0 degrees.  The most efficient relative wind angle (including apparent wind) is probably around 90 degrees, but the exact number is unimportant.  If you start sailing from stationary with the wind at 90 degrees, you&#39;ll pick up speed, but now because of your apparent wind, the wind angle is probably closer to 70 degrees now, so you should turn away from the wind again to bring the apparent wind angle back to 90 degrees.  But now because your efficiency has increased you&#39;ll accelerate, meaning the apparent wind will decrease the wind angle again, so you must turn away from the wind again.  This is obviously a positive feedback loop that in principle will allow you to accelerate indefinitely.  The limiting factor is obviously drag, but if drag is small enough, one can sail faster than the wind.  Normal cruisers have a lot of drag so their most efficient angle is relatively low, whereas an ice yacht will have an ideal angle of around 170 degrees once they&#39;re up to speed.", "comment_date": "2017-07-01T16:47:42Z", "likes_count": 30}, {"comment_by": "Akram Safirul", "comment_text": "you should do a collab with the guy wearing canada&#39;s shirt", "comment_date": "2017-07-01T14:03:03Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Tomeu Rossell\u00f3 Pons", "comment_text": "Hi Derek,<br>I think you got the last one wrong.

If you are going down wind (with the wind) you must sheet out the main sail and jib slightly to create the vessel to go faster, and more aerodynamic. If you are going against or into the wind, you must use a method called tacking. Tacking is the method where you go in a zig zag pattern to catch as much wind as possible, as safe and fast as possible. This is basically the same for all types of vessels, square rigged, schooners, brigs, ketches, brigantines, sloops etc. now for sail theory, sail theory is the theory in which where the wind pushes the sails and ship forward. When the wind has the high pressure pushing into the sail, the low pressure ricochets the bends of the sail so it pushes the force back creating less friction at the front creating low pressure at the front of the sails. The term on which the ship is slowest is &quot;in irons&quot; the ship is faced into the wind and the sails are sheeted in so they are horizontal to the boat, this will create luffing, the sails will begin to wave all over and you will go nowhere, the fastest state is called &quot;running free&quot; this means the ship is going with the wind and the sails are slightly sheeted out. This not only creates aerodynamics but also creates a faster ability to sail.", "comment_date": "2014-02-18T23:47:04Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Daniel Park", "comment_text": "<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M4CQ4T_K8Hw&amp;t=1m34s\">1:34</a> Is that Nerdcubed&#39;s Dad??", "comment_date": "2014-01-03T03:53:35Z", "likes_count": 3}, {"comment_by": "C B Hubbs", "comment_text": "Classmates and I learned about this in Physics class, and we watched videos about the sailboats used in American Cup sailboat races.", "comment_date": "2013-11-28T05:59:42Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Suki Hyman", "comment_text": "true, also the fastest point of sail would be closer to a broad reach assuming you came down to it from close hauled, or up from running.\n\nbut good video otherwise, I enjoyed it :)", "comment_date": "2013-11-04T20:25:03Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "atomgonuclear", "comment_text": "They left out an important explanation of the actual forces that occur on the boat while sailing up wind.

And the reason I made that vid was so there would be backup for this vid because I knew we didn&#39;t have time to go into lift in detail in this vid.", "comment_date": "2012-08-06T03:20:38Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "m r", "comment_text": "\\.=. lawn mower", "comment_date": "2012-08-06T03:18:19Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "m r", "comment_text": "skeet  skeet skeet", "comment_date": "2012-08-06T03:18:05Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "snower13", "comment_text": "So you release a video &quot;How A Wing Actually Works&quot; which says Bernoulli doesn&#39;t fully explain why it generates lift and then in this video, you have a guy basically say that Bernoulli is the reason why the sail (wing) generates force (lift).
