But this point is moving around the wheel, so the side of the wheel that the top rotates towards gets pushed out. In the same way, the bottom of the wheel is trying to travel inwards, so the other side of the wheel gets pushed inward. So if you think about it, it&#39;s just like applying an outward force to the left of the wheel, and an inward force to the right of the wheel, or vise versa. That&#39;s what causes the horizontal rotation instead of the vertical rotation.", "comment_date": "2021-11-18T13:27:28Z", "likes_count": 4}, {"comment_by": "Swastik a banerjee", "comment_text": "Walter lewin sir...", "comment_date": "2021-11-17T05:37:45Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Suthari.

This kind of explanation GUARANTEES the student will NOT understand the concept in any meaningful way. First of all I challenge anyone, after watching this video, to explain angular momentum. Further, vectors don&#39;t push vectors, they are mathematical constructs not physical bodies subject to force. The same is true of the so-called torque vector.<br><br>I am a retired physics instructor with 33 years experience teaching physics at about every level conceivable, from entry level survey classes to freshman physics with calculus. I have NEVER introduced this concept this way, and certainly not to an audience of non-scientists such as those watching YouTube. Yes, once the students understand the REAL physics of what is happening, then I introduce angular momentum and torque.<br><br>Honestly, how many of you REALLY understand what is actually happening at a level where you could explain it to someone else?<br><br>Based on my experience, and the critique above, I had to give this video a thumbs down. I am disappointed, I thought he would do a better job teaching this at a level where the average person could come away saying, &quot;NOW, I understand!&quot;<br><br>First, I am going to make a bold controversial statement. The angular momentum and torque vectors do not exist in reality, they are mathematical constructs. Prove it you say! Okay, that is very easy. You saw him using his right hand, curling his fingers and pointing to show the two vectors. But I can do exactly the same thing with my left hand and get exactly the same results. The choice of hands is arbitrary. So what? If the vectors represented real quantities, we could not reverse them and get the same result. If you apply a force in a given direction the force vector represent that force, which points in the direction of the force. Angular momentum and torque are real, but the vectors we use to represent them are mathematical constructs.<br><br>So why do we teach concepts using constructs that are not real? Because they work, and make it easy to analyze real world scenarios, but they sacrifice understanding. So here is a simple explanation of what is happening using simple Newtonian concepts that a fifth grader could understand.<br><br>Let&#39;s use his demonstration for the lesson.<br><br>1)  When the orange section is at the top of the wheel it is moving toward him, it has momentum. The wheel is suspended so that it experiences a force at the orange spot directed to his right, as a result of the torque. In other words, if he lets go of the stationary wheel the top will fall to his right toward you the viewer, or clockwise from his perspective. If the orange section is moving toward him and a force pushes toward his right it will turn to the right, turning the entire wheel. This will happen all along the top half of the wheel.<br><br>Try this. Hold your right hand in front of your face with your thumb up and your fingers pointing toward your face. Now slowly move your hand toward your face like the top of the wheel. Use your left hand to push your moving hand to the right and it will rotate toward the right. If this were the wheel it would rotate so the side closer to you moved toward the right while the opposite side moved to the left., or counterclockwise looking down on it from the top.<br><br>2) Now let&#39;s analyze the bottom half of the wheel where the orange section is moving away from him. In this case the force on the orange section will be toward his left. The orange section moving away from him turns to the left so the section closer to him once again rotates toward his right or counterclockwise as viewed from above.<br><br>This time hold your left hand about belly button level and point your fingers away from you. Slowly move you hand away from you and push it toward the left with your right hand. Of course, it turns left. If this were the wheel the side closer to you would rotate to the right while the opposite side rotated left, exactly the same rotation as before.<br><br>The combined forces would rotate the wheel so the side closer to him rotates right, while the opposite side rotate left, or counterclockwise as viewed downward from above.<br><br>This is what is actually happening physically, a simple case of force changing the direction of moving mass. While this is a simple explanation of what is happening, it would require calculations for a huge number of sections, and the results would then have to be added together.  It is easier to define and use the mathematical constructs, angular momentum vector, and torque vector to do the calculations even though you sacrifice an understanding of the underlying physical process.<br><br>Wayne Y.

It helps to imagine that atoms in the rim of the wheel are like a bunch of small, visible metal balls, placed in a tube of a shape of the wheel&#39;s rim. Each little ball while rotating with the rim wants to stay in it&#39;s rotation plane, which coincides with the wheel. But wheel  under it&#39;s own weight slowly moves downwards and changes the rotation plane angle going from vertical relative to floor to horizontal. Since small metal balls do not want to leave the rotation plane ( low of God or nature or self evident truth while we live on our Earth\ud83d\ude33 , that does not need a proof\ud83e\udd14\ud83d\ude0a) and cteats by their momentum the opposite torq to the torq that is caused by the wheel&#39;s weight, and creates a torq that makes wheel rotate around vertical axis. If vectors showing dynamic forces ( as the result of changing rotational plane by the weight of the wheel)of little balls are drawn it becomes visible that rim&#39;s matter that finds itself horizontally opposit the wheel&#39;s axle creates procession torq, and matter that finds itself on top an bottom of the rotating rim creates resisting torq to the torq created by wheel&#39;s weight.<br>I hope it is possible to relate to what I am trying to explain here\ud83d\ude1f\ud83d\ude0d!

What do you remember about perpendicular vectors?  I CANNOT understand why people would rather believe in mnemonic devices like laws and rules rather than actually understanding the mechanism of CAUSE.  Currently, angular momentum ONLY works AFTER the right-hand rule, not the left-hand rule.  It has floored me for 20 years.  I cannot get it published, because math followers cannot see it, and I have math DESCRIBING THE ACTUAL CAUSE (without laws and rules),,,still, no joy.  Paradigms are STUPID, and you should second-guess something now and then.  I have a video with a link to the paper at SSRN.<br>A tilting plane creates a tilting velocity condition at the ends with a tilt axis through the diameter.  These tilt velocities at the ends of the plane are opposing axially parallel to the spin axis and completely reverse in each half of a rotation.  That acceleration is focused at the tilt axis on each half.  The rate for this velocity exchange is the ONLY participant taken from the spin axis, IT&#39;S PERPENDICULAR!  The tilt axis creates a motion in the disk, and then it continues to follow that motion like a car axle producing a normal acceleration force to the disk THE WHOLE TIME.  There are supplemental effects, but this is 100% at level precession.  This is what cause looks like.  Modern science is really scaring me, because people are blind to cause when it contradicts the math.  THIS IS STUPID.<br>Imagine if medicine described symptoms with math and ignored the causal disease.

I&#39;ve been slowly learning more and more about gyroscopic procession and angular momentum, and my mind of course has constantly been asking the question, &quot;How?&quot; and with each and every new revelation, &quot;How?&quot; and &quot;Why?&quot;  I remember my technology teacher in highschool who was teaching us what we needed to earn CompTIA certifications telling us that we shouldn&#39;t have our CD/DVD drives sitting sideways because it would stress the drive more over time and reduce its lifespan. I thought then that she had to be wrong because theoretically a solid disc has equal mass on all sides, right? I realize now I was wrong, but I think I&#39;ve also realized something else.  So I have a hypothesis on this, and that is that the acceleration of gravity is affecting the wheel at all times, and so when it&#39;s not spinning it simply falls.  I hope I can explain this next part clearly:  So again the wheel has a mass and the acceleration of gravity is affecting that mass at all times, but acceleration is applied over time.  So if you imagine one point on the wheel and imagine it&#39;s mass that&#39;s spinning at  X rpm&#39;s it will still have had the force of gravity applied to it over time, but the vector of the force of gravity will change because of the wheel&#39;s spin. At different points in time it will either be working with or fighting against the acceleration of gravity.  That&#39;s about as much as I&#39;ve got and again it&#39;s a hypothesis.

Though I do appreciate the use of scientific terminology, however, when it comes to a field of unfamiliarity, those terminologies do very little to help one garner an actual understanding, rendering this explanation unintuitive, (though I understand intuition is subjective)<br><br>For example, you re-introduce the concept of vectors when explaining the forces of angular momentum on the wheel, and clearly showed how the resultant force created an outward torque perpendicular to the object. However, it is still unclear how the centripetal motion of an object correlates with an outward movement at all, -to me, that leads to the spurious notion that if you spin a top fast enough, it&#39;ll create an upward &quot;torque&quot; allowing it to generate a force contrary to gravitational force, and a lift off the ground. Now I know this misunderstanding is largely due to my own ignorance, and that this in no ways is what he&#39;s trying to convey, and he does make a distinction between the force and torque vector, fair enough; however, an explanation or elaboration on the concept on torque itself is much to be desired, at least for me.<br><br>In the end, I am aware of the concept of vectors, and how they are measured or ascribe, but I am still left yearning for a true understanding of the exact phenomena that is taking place here; what exactly is keeping this object from toppling over under the weight of gravity while in motion, why does pivoting a spinning object fixed to rotating segment cause it to rise and fall? <br><br>Clearly this man is quite brilliant, And this video has helped millions in understanding, he clearly took his time to make this video which I would not watch if I had perceived it to have little merit in that regard, it&#39;s just this answer was not as intuitive as I had hoped it would be.
