Or have We given them a Book from which they (can derive) clear (evidence)?- Nay, the wrong-doers promise each other nothing but delusions.<br><br><br><br>The angels and the spirit ascend unto him in a Day the measure whereof is (as) fifty thousand years. <br><br>He rules (all) affairs from the heavens to the earth: in the end will (all affairs) go up to Him, on a Day, the space whereof will be (as) a thousand years of your reckoning.<br><br>Verily, all things have We created in proportion and measure<br><br><br><br>Allah is the Light of the heavens and the earth. The Parable of His Light is as if there were a Niche and within it a Lamp: the Lamp enclosed in Glass: the glass as it were a brilliant star: Lit from a blessed Tree, an Olive, neither of the east nor of the west, whose oil is well-nigh luminous, though fire scarce touched it: Light upon Light! Allah doth guide whom He will to His Light: Allah doth set forth Parables for men: and Allah doth know all things<br><br><br><br>It is He Who created the Night and the Day, and the sun and the moon: all (the celestial bodies) swim along, each in its rounded course.<br><br><br>And if ye are in doubt as to what We have revealed from time to time to Our servant, then produce a Sura like thereunto; and call your witnesses or helpers (If there are any) besides Allah, if your (doubts) are true.<br><br>Do they not consider the Qur&#39;an (with care)? Had it been from other Than Allah, they would surely have found therein Much discrepancy.<br><br><br>O men! Here is a parable set forth! listen to it! Those on whom, besides Allah, ye call, cannot create (even) a fly, if they all met together for the purpose! and if the fly should snatch away anything from them, they would have no power to release it from the fly. Feeble are those who petition and those whom they petition!When Our Clear Signs are rehearsed to them, thou wilt notice a denial on the faces of the Unbelievers! they nearly attack with violence those who rehearse Our Signs to them. Say, &quot;Shall I tell you of something (far) worse than these Signs? It is the Fire (of Hell)! Allah has promised it to the Unbelievers! and evil is that destination!&quot;<br><br><br>Man We did create from a quintessence (of clay);<br>Then We placed him as (a drop of) sperm in a place of rest, firmly fixed;Then We made the sperm into a clot of congealed blood; then of that clot We made a (foetus) lump; then we made out of that lump bones and clothed the bones with flesh; then we developed out of it another creature. So blessed be Allah, the best to create!<br>After that, at length ye will dieAgain, on the Day of Judgment, will ye be raised up.<br><br><br><br>Say: &quot;O men!

Much has happened in the past Milky Way galactic year just past as we rotated around that black hole we now have an image of as never before. The future is bright, the future is galactic. Now let&#39;s zoom down on google earth to our localities and begin to planetize ourselves. Globalization has been the process of discovering ourselves to be inhabiting a planet globe. And planets exist in galactic time scales that, as humans, one can only intellectually comprehend, humans only live about a hundred orbits of their star, two hundred thirty million years for a human mind to comprehend is not actually possible. But I think it&#39;s pretty certain another two hundred million years will pass as we orbit that black hole, how shall we begin planning the future? Hmm I know, let&#39;s start with establishing a smartphone game called Planet Sovereignty where all those with a smartphone think the planet has Sovereignty. And Planet Sovereignty has sovereignty over national sovereignty, over all nations, because it includes all nations and includes everyone&#39;s smartphone, all of everything being the planet orbiting a black hole every two hundred thirty million Earth years. In this smartphone game even one&#39;s smartphone is under Planet Sovereignty above national sovereignty. Billions of humans, over half the planet population, have access to the internet, world-wide web, youtube and short clear documentaries explaining our place in the universe, let&#39;s begin the next galactic year optimistically.

So imagine you are scuba diving and staying at a depth of 20m. You don\u2019t change your depth during this experiment. There are about 3bars of pressure down there so the air you breath has a density about 3 times as high as on sea level. The amount of air you breath in is thus about three times of that on the sea level. Volume stays the same but density is higher. <br><br>Why can\u2018t you hold your breath longer if there are 3 times as many molecules in your lung? <br><br>I have asked a couple of scuba dive instructors about this but no one could answer the question.

But he circumvented a little bit the actual problem, which is overinterpretation of data. <br>If we would also see the surroundings of this image, if it weren&#39;t conveniently cropped, we would see a lot of more bright structures.  They just picked one area for convenience, because the data fitted the model.<br>If we look closer at the image, we see actually three bright spots that form the alleged halo of the Black Hole. This does not fit the description of a Black Hole. What we possibly see there are three hot areas that create the image of a ring because of the low resolution. But it seems to be an optical illusion rather than a ring.<br>They claim that the diameter of the ring fits the calculation of the shadow of the Black Hole. But fact is that they cannot measure the mass other than calculating it based on the diameter of this ring. Since it is calculated and not measured, they used circular logic, and the conclusion became the premise.<br><br>What we have here is sensationalism in order to justify further funding, it&#39;s not actual scientific observation. If there is a super-massive Black Hole in the center of the galaxy the surrounding conditions would not allow us to produce an image of it. Keep in mind that our solar system is exactly located on the plane of our galaxy and all its matter is between us and the alleged Black Hole. We are not looking from the top. The idea that any radiation would penetrate all the matter between the center of the galaxy and us is absurd. So whatever we see on that image is unclear. It could be anything. A connection with a Black Hole in the center of the galaxy is speculative and highly unlikely.

Does anyone doubt that the MRI is a photo of the brain? No. But no human can see the light used to make these photos. These photos of black holes are no different. They gather image data using radio frequency light. Then just like x-ray, or MRI, a computer program processes the data into an image our eyes can see. And this image of a black hole is just as real as the image of a bone or brain. A photo of Pluto taken by the New Horizons space probe also depends utterly on computers. These four imaging systems use four wavelength bands of electromagnetic radiation: x-ray from 10 picometers to 10 nanometers, visible from 400 nanometers to 700 nanometers, the Event Horizon Telescope from 1.3 millimeters, and the MRI from 10 meters to 100 meters. (MRI does not actually produce electromagnetic radiation, nor broadcast it. The M in MRI stands for Magnetic, and the instrument produces almost only the magnetic part of the electromagnetic radiation.

The Michelson-Morley experiment proved the existence of an inertial ether. One fortieth part of the shift of the interference fringes of the Michelson-Morley interferometer, from the calculated value according to the hypothesis of imbeciles, is the superposition contribution of the substance of the inertial ether of the Sun to the field of the inertial ether on the Earth&#39;s surface with an accuracy of 2.8% (according to existing estimates of sizes and masses). Each point of space is unique in its physical essence, since it has its own unique superposition contribution coefficients from all celestial bodies, and &quot;general relativity&quot; is idiocy, like &quot;quantum theory&quot;, &quot;Bohr&#39;s idiocy&quot; and much more. The ratio of the sizes of luminosities from the &quot;black holes&quot; M87 and MW does not correspond to the ratio of their masses. The size of the luminosity of the &quot;black hole&quot; MW is 180 times less than the dispersion radius of the near foci of the orbits of the nearest stars, therefore, the size of the superstar MW is 200-300 times larger than the orbit of Mercury and the superstar has a rod structure of crystalline neutrons protected by shells of inertial substance of two polarities with zero albedo, explaining the twinkling of nearby stars. The same structure takes place in all the cores of stars, planets, satellites of planets and many asteroids. This structure Humanity defined 46 kBC in modern Arizona and called gravity - &quot;The law of four branches connecting celestial bodies&quot;; only four rods from the center of the earth in the equatorial plane were clearly identified. But the plagiarist-pederast Newton used this term for inertial phenomena, according to the well-known technology of the genocide of Mankind, to which Newton himself does not belong. These images are the result of fluctuations of ionized gas encircling coherent neutron beams emanating from the crystalline neutron rods of galaxies in the direction of highest density towards the observer, with the contribution of other nearby rods of a different direction. Galaxy M87 is in the phase of rebirths. Therefore, its linear dimensions of the cross section of a coherent neutron beam are 1400 times larger. An MW-sized galaxy has a rebirths cycle of at least 7.5 billion years. Behind the MW galaxy there is a trace of at least four previous rebirths participating in new rebirths. The nonsense of the &quot;big bang&quot; was necessary for a veiled physical and mathematical search for a solution to the concept of the father of all atomic bombs Fridman Alexander Alexandrovich, to spin neutrons so that they do not form a coherent neutron pulse, as in the Kaiser-Hitler bombs, the Chernobyl nuclear power plant, Fukushima-1, &quot;Chelyabinsk meteorite&quot;, in the bombs-cataclysmic of Hitler from Netanyahu.", "comment_date": "2022-05-15T14:59:28Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "DP BBC", "comment_text": "I love b hole", "comment_date": "2022-05-15T14:56:43Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "David van de Water", "comment_text": "Interpretation as scientists do, thats the problem.

The speakers included a parliament member, a medical professor, a journalist, and human rights advocates.\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>Six online forums were held during the World Summit on Combating and Preventing Forced Organ Harvesting, an online event over two weekends from September 17 to 26. Thirty-eight speakers from 19 countries participated. \r<br>\r<br>One of the speakers, Elisabetta Zamparutti, is a lawyer and member of the Committee for the Prevention of Torture, Council of Europe, Italy. As a former member of the Italian Parliament, Ms. Zamparutti is also a board member of \u201cPrison Insider,\u201d an NGO for worldwide information on prison conditions. She is considered an expert in monitoring prison conditions and treatment of detainees.\r<br>\r<br>In her speech, Zamparutti called on international organizations such as the United Nations and the Council of the European Union, as well as the general public, to take action against the CCP\u2019s crime of forced organ harvesting. \r<br>\r<br>\u201cFundamental rights, inviolable principles such as the right to life, to physical integrity, to mental integrity, to freedom are systematically violated by this totalitarian regime,\u201d she explained. As a result, people are wronged, government officials commit wrongdoings, and torture is prevalent across China, not to mention the unimaginable brutality of forced organ harvesting. While a government is supposed to protect its people, the CCP detains citizens based on their belief and kills them for their organs. \r<br>\r<br>Zamparutti said she was shocked to learn that the main victims of the atrocity are practitioners of Falun Gong, a meditation system practiced by nearly 100 million people in China. In fact, the rate of organ harvesting in China has reached an industrial scale and is carried out for profit. Ironically, medical professionals, including doctors, surgeons, anesthetists, and nurses, who are supposed to save lives, have unfortunately become part of this killing machine. The very existence of such a machine is perplexing; meanwhile, Ms. Zamparutti noted that it begs a feeling of shame \u2013 we know that the crime is continuing, and yet many of us are maintaining a closer and closer relationship with the CCP. \r<br>\r<br>That is why we need intervention from the international community, commented Zamparutti. She believes that \u201ccrimes against humanity\u201d is the most accurate description of the forced organ harvesting, as defined by the China Tribunal established in London in 2018. The tribunal found that the CCP had conducted systematic physical examinations of Falun Gong practitioners in preparation for organ extraction. Evidence has also shown that Falun Gong practitioners had their organs harvested even before they were confirmed as brain dead. \r<br>\r<br>\u201cNow this is a truly hellish scenario that must lead us to mobilize as organizations committed to the protection of human rights, as individuals, and also as institutions. I think that there should be an appeal to everyone, to citizens but also to supranational bodies,\u201d stated Zamparutti. \r<br>\r<br>She added, \u201cThe UN has intervened, but we must also address the World Health Organization, the Council of Europe, the European Parliament, all those bodies that can intervene and that can especially give indications so that there is no cooperation [on this issue] with China.\u201d \r<br>\r<br>She suggested placing forced organ harvesting as a priority issue in any bilateral or multilateral discussion with the Chinese regime. \u201cIn the face of this shame of humanity, we must also ask ourselves what we can do to change the situation,\u201d she said.

The antimatter particles are exactly equal in mass and number to the matter particles and the result is no net residual of matter left over. \r<br>\r<br>Running the universe back in time is not the same for energy and matter as assumed in all these models! Think of a candle burning (like star we see today) the ENERGY can go back to a very small point BUT the MATTER does not! The candle gets bigger until it reaches a maximum mass and then STOPS! Stars must by the second law do the same they can only go back to the point of maximum hydrogen and that is their minimum entropy state! \r<br>\r<br>That means the real Big Bang was first an expansion of space and energy with no mass to very nearly the size we observe today then the creation of stars in their lowest entropy state or maximum hydrogen fuel state. Which actually matches what the bible says God did in the opening chapter of Genesis! \r<br>\r<br>Day 1 God said &quot;let there be light&quot; expansion of space and photon energy giving us the very smooth CMBR \r<br>Day 4 God said &quot;he made the stars also&quot; after the expansion by collapsing the wave energy into atoms of hydrogen. \r<br>\r<br>We know from Young&#39;s double slit experiment that a MIND can collapse a wave to produce a particle and <b>the particle&#39;s history is written retrospectively</b> back from the moment of measurement. This solves the starlight time problem if that event took place about 6000 years ago on day 4 of the creation after God had stretched forth the heavens and filled it with wave energy. It means the history of the stars we observe is real and does go back billions of years calculated by the distance but it could all have been created 6000 years ago. \r<br>\r<br>This is why Adam could see the stars on the sixth day. With the discovery of gravity waves we also know space is elastic and this could explain the apparent acceleration of space as an elastic medium expanding like a spring. Thus the Genesis account stands alone as meeting all the laws of physics without any special pleading only that God is exactly who he says he is and did what he said he did in the bible.", "comment_date": "2022-05-14T06:31:39Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Tamal Mahato", "comment_text": "It was like a dream.i wanna dive into your explanation", "comment_date": "2022-05-14T06:28:33Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Liza_Official", "comment_text": "I&#39;ve gotta say that your &quot;what does a black hole look like?&quot; explanation is by far the best.

Wilson Vitelio Hidalgo Suarez<br>Author.<br>I can check mathematically and apply it to real life!<br>I can describe that a black hole when compressed will increase<br>The intensity would gravitate to the contrary, when a black hole grows, the gravitational intensity decreases! Well, many scientists are publishing that there are black holes of 1 - 100 - 1000 million solar masses, which can swallow entire planets and stars! That is very FALSE! I&#39;ll check it with simple calculations!<br>EXAMPLE: Imagine that the sun is compressed into a<br>radius equal to that of the earth 6.378 x I0e6 m. Calculate the<br>strength of the sun&#39;s gravitational field at this<br>condition.<br>Eg = M / 4\u03c0\ud835\udc5f^2\ud835\udc3a<br>Eg = 2.0 x 10^30 \ud835\udc3e\ud835\udc54. / 4 x 3.15 x (6.78 x 10^6)^2 \ud835\udc65<br>6.63 \ud835\udc65 10\u221211\ud835\udc41\ud835\udc5a2/\ud835\udc3e\ud835\udc542<br>Eg = 2.0 x \ud835\udfcf\ud835\udfcee\ud835\udfd1\ud835\udfce\ud835\udc72\ud835\udc88. / 3.84 x \ud835\udfcf\ud835\udfcee\ud835\udfd2 = 5.2 x \ud835\udfcf\ud835\udfcee\ud835\udfd0\ud835\udfd3 N/m<br>Thus, as the radius of a massive star decreases, it increases.<br>The intensity of the gravitational field, because its mass increases, but its size must decrease, so that its gravity is really intense! If the black hole is giant, its density decreases, its mass is equal to the initial one, before the star becomes a black hole, we imagine a super giant star of thousands of solar masses! A super giant black hole the strength of its gravitational field would be less! But if we compress it, the intensity of the gravitational field increases ACCORDING TO<br>Predict my equation that was designed by me in 1992 and published in my<br>Book, The Enigmas of the Universe and the Particles in 2007", "comment_date": "2022-05-14T05:01:51Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "AndroidGameplays4Every1", "comment_text": "Looks like an 80&#39;s videogame explosion animation frame.", "comment_date": "2022-05-14T05:01:26Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Chael MacDonald", "comment_text": "Love the video, pretty annoyed by the thumbnail\u2026", "comment_date": "2022-05-14T04:59:50Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Yeet boy", "comment_text": "&quot;it&#39;s our b hole&quot;<br>Butt hole...?", "comment_date": "2022-05-14T04:57:03Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Liza_Official", "comment_text": "This is an excellent explanation of the actual visible images we&#39;ve been seeing!

Each object has their own gravity, it being either weak or strong.  Black Holes are just super massive compact objects that their gravity even affects light.<br><br>Technically speaking, with our current technology we cannot &quot;see black holes&quot;, but &quot;observe&quot; the effect these have what is nearby.  It is explained pretty well!<br><br>Now, comparing Black Holes to planet Earth.  The &quot;event horizon&quot; is thought to be the &quot;black curtain&quot; that could be compare to an &quot;atmosphere&quot;.  At some point, when you get too close to Earth you would start falling into it.  Same thing with Black Holes.  Now say you are orbiting around it at the right angle/velocity, you would just be going around like a moon, satellite.<br><br>The &quot;singularity&quot; is not the event horizon.  It is theory that can exist logically by Einstein&#39;s Theory of relativity.  With enough force you can breakdown space and time.<br><br>Black holes spin, this can be proven by how they affect nearby objects and &quot;jets&quot; that actually escape the event horizon.  We don&#39;t know if these were ever inside, but it&#39;s very unlikely.<br><br>As of today, it is impossible to know what happens inside a black hole, since information is lost due to the event horizon.  Maybe in the future we can or in a way using quantum physics&#39; string theory.<br><br>Also also also!!!  These &quot;images&quot; we see anything that&#39;s super far away, it&#39;s what they looked like many years ago.  It is thought that Sagittarius A* is 26,000 light-years away, so we see it how it was 26k ago, and we will never know how it looks now...until 26k more years pass by.

Therefore it can reasonably be assumed that a Black Hole is Quantum in nature and likely the idea that we explain the Physics of a Black Hole as a function of gravity and the so called event horizon is fundamentally incorrect. Gravity as a force is a curious expression best defined by relativity, yet we do not know, how the nature of gravity properly expresses itself at a local level, rather that we observe and measure it&#39;s effects according to nothing more than an inverse square law principal observed and validated largely through Newtonian physics.. Now this is a principle at work in electro/magnetic theory and is well understood, but currently the observable reality of a black hole being an object about which entire galaxies rotate is not consistent with an inverse square law argument. In fact the escape velocity of most objects in the milky way could not be sustained by even an object of infinite mass if such an object were subject to the inverse square law nature of gravity.", "comment_date": "2022-05-13T08:27:07Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "SAYTEN", "comment_text": "\ud83e\udd14", "comment_date": "2022-05-13T08:25:00Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Sleeperdog", "comment_text": "Hey Veritasium, love your videos.

Wherever you have an astronomical quantity of mass &quot;dilation&quot; (sometimes called gamma or y) will occur. Mass that is dilated is smeared through spacetime relative to an outside observer. General relativity does not predict singularities when you factor in dilation, Einstein wrote about this in the 1939 journal &quot;Annals of Mathematics&quot;. Nobody believed in black holes when he was alive for this reason. There is no place in the universe where mass is more concentrated than at the center of a galaxy. 99.8% of the mass in our solar system is in the sun. 99.9% of the mass of an atom is in the nucleus. If these norms are true for galaxies than we can infer that there is 100&#39;s of trillions of solar masses at the center of high mass galaxies. There is no way to know through observation, there is far too much interference, dilation and gravitational lensing. High mass means high momentum. If we attribute a radius to these numbers than we can calculate that relativistic velocities exist in these regions.<br>    The mass at the center of our own galaxy is dilated, in some sublime way that mass is all around us, there is no direction you can point your finger that you are not pointing to it. This is the explanation for the abnormally high rotation rates of stars in high mass galaxies (the reason for the theory of dark matter). Low mass galaxies have normal star rotation rates, this is what relativity would predict because there is an insufficient quantity of mass to achieve relativistic velocities. This to me is clear proof that Einstein was correct, there can be no other realistic explanation for this fact.<br>   If you pose the question &quot;why cant we see light from the galactic center&quot; the modern answer would be because gravitational forces there are so strong that not even light can escape (even though the mass of the photon is zero). Einstein&#39;s answer would be because the mass there is dilated relative to an Earth bound observer. Einstein&#39;s answer perfectly explains the greatest mystery in science (the rotation rates of stars in spiral galaxies).<br>   The belief in black holes gradually came about after television and magazines put that counterintuitive image in peoples minds.

Not perfect looking at it now, but there are some crazy ideas that are thought invoking. <br><br>It is believed, that black holes are formed in the aftermath of a supernova with the collapse of a star\u2019s core, when, in actuality, the answer could be much more simple and less general. Particularly, it is believed that when a very massive star ends its life in a supernova, the remaining matter collapses in upon itself. Then, if there is enough mass in this collapsed star, a black hole is formed. Although this seems to answer the question, we have to put faith in the idea that a black hole is, in fact, formed this way because we have no means of proving this. Conversely, if we take what we know about physics and reality by observing what is apparent, we can potentially arrive at more sensible conclusions. First, we must establish that when we use the speed of light (c) as the ultimate means of measurement and observation of the universe at vast distances, we lose the ability to accurately observe phenomenon that could exist beyond that threshold. Considering this, we can describe black hole formation by atoms that exceed c and, in turn, propagate at that inherent velocity. Notably, when an atom exceeds c, its comprising subatomic particles achieve the same potential. For example, imagine a bug net and two insects that fly at separate speeds. When both bugs are trapped in a bug net, they both equal its speed and each others as well. As a result they are no longer able to separate themselves. Comparatively, when an atom loses its structure and its apparent field, it results in a total collapse. Specifically, the effect of an atom which contains roughly 99% empty space collapsing is such that its subatomic particles will group tightly together and the resulting formation will reach a 99% greater density. Furthermore, when the new formation of subatomic particles collides with atoms of lesser potential, those atoms will reach the faster potential of the formation, collapse and add to the concentrated and growing mass of subatomic particles. Ultimately, the compounding effect of the growing collection of tightly packed subatomic particles traveling beyond c will result in the formation of a black hole.<br><br>\tIt\u2019s a popular scientific belief that light appears warped near a black hole due to its immense gravity bending it, but that could be a limit of our perception. For example, when we use a camera to take a picture of a fast moving object and use a slower shutter speed, the object appears to be blurred. With the same logic, when you envision c as the shutter speed of the camera, everything slower than it will appear clearly and everything faster will seem blurred. Therefore, if we can accept that a black hole actually travels faster than c, then we can argue that it only appears to bend light as a result of the contrast of speed.<br><br>\tConstantly unexplained fluctuating energy levels in the universe are explained by modern science, (and science fiction,) to be a result of energy transfer between parallel dimensions however, a more realistic explanation exists. This anomaly could actually be explained by the formation of black holes and their ultimate disjointing. First, when an atom is broken down into its basic components and those components are tightly compressed, they cease to emit measurable energy. Eventually, a black hole slows to a point below that of c by colliding with enough atoms to equal the potential that caused its initial particles to exceed c. Subsequently, the subatomic particles will no longer be at equivalent potentials and the result will be the instantaneous formation of new atoms and their associated fields. As a result a rapid simultaneous expansion of atoms in all directions will occur, which will introduce a considerable amount of measurable energy into the universe.<br><br>According to the Big Bang theory, the universe was once in an extremely hot and dense state which expanded rapidly, but how could scientists have ever come to this conclusion without explaining why and how it arrived at that state in the first place? By applying the previously mentioned concepts, we can rationalize that the Big Bang was actually created by the disjointing of a black hole that had consumed the entire universe. To illustrate, a black hole moving at a velocity faster than c grew fast and to a point far beyond super massive. Furthermore, the superior speed accomplished by the black hole allowed it to reach the end of space expansion in all directions, enabling it to consume the universe in its entirety. When this occurred, the entire universe equaled the potential of the beyond super massive black hole and brought it to a point immediately below c. Consequently, the instantaneous formation of all atoms in the universe and their associated fields, as a result of every subatomic particle ceasing to exist at an equivalent potential, resulted in the massive, simultaneous expansion that we call the Big Bang.  This resulted in the outermost particles having the pressure of all inner particles exerted upon them. The subsequent outermost particles had the same minus one inner particles exerted upon them. This is why the expansion of the universe is not constant, but rather that resembling the fibonacci sequence. <br><br>  Black holes are just one example of a way the science community could be answering questions by using means that can\u2019t be realistically comprehended. We live in a universe perceived by our senses and when we try to describe it by using inexplicable subject matter not observed this way, we arrive at unfulfilling answers.

CERN was made to verify or denounce its very existence and they thought the Standard Model would be &quot;complete&quot; after its discovery. Boy were they wrong. They have amped up the voltage and are venturing into uncharted territory and they are beginning to understand that the SM isn&#39;t exactly wrong, but yet again only part of a bigger picture.<br><br>Neither General Relativity or Quantum Mechanics or our understanding of supposed quantum gravity can never even begin to be unified with the current SM alone. Next couple of years will be very exciting in particle physics and astronomy, which in reality is part of the same field. LIGO+LHC+EHT+JWST is one heck of a combo and will in conjunction revolutionize our understanding of natural science and the cosmos. <br><br>Once Webb is fully operational we&#39;ll see some stunning pictures, but the science we&#39;ll get from them will be even more mindblowing., <br><br>I&#39;m in the field and know many incredible people working with truly groundbreaking stuff. The public understanding on how the universe works is just so out of touch.<br><br>There is plenty of knowledge that really have no purpose passing to mainstream, because it would only lead to confusion. Many of the causal effects we&#39;ve documented are too complex to be understood either way, so the best course of action is by practical applications and technology. Information is slowly dripping into mainstream, but if we released what we now know directly to the general population it would only lead to chaos, so we have to make it a smoother transition.<br><br>People really have no clue how advanced technology humanity have. Military technology is at any given time at least 15-20 years ahead of what the public even know of.<br><br>But there is way more advanced technology in the civilian fields and the separation of military and civil sciences is crucial. Technology and practical applications driven manufacturing weapons HAVE to morally and ethically be separated from advanced studies of quantum field research. We can&#39;t have anyone weaponizing the deepest knowledge of particle physics and its implications. Not only would the research be ethically wrong, but potentially hazardous. But there are always extremely stringent security around the cutting edge science and we&#39;ve moved to Photon Encryption and no entity can tap in. It is physically impossible to decipher PE, because you&#39;d have to break the laws of physics to read the information. You have to physically download from the mainframe without security clearance and as far as I know Tom Cruise is busy atm. \ud83d\ude0e\ud83d\ude0f<br><br>But the next years will be incredibly exciting.

Vastly greater field of view would both be very interesting to see but also add great credibility to them being true images.

There is one thing I would like to add to the explanation of the combination of the radio telescopes. The picture you showed is perfectly correct and may be viewed as resolving the ambiguity of the different antenna pairs. But if you were to zoom out to obtain a picture of a wider portion of the sky, you would see periodic repetitions of the picture (or rather the maximum of the field of the array formed by the antennas). Therefore, the procedure can only work since objects in the sky are sparesly distributed, since any light coming from a direction of one of these secondary beams would also be mapped onton the resulting picture. <br>This phenonemon is called Grating Lobes and it will always appear if the distance between the antennas in a multi-antenna array are further apart than half a wavelength. By the way there is a really cool link of this to a discrete fourier transform with undersampling. <br>Thanks for all the effort put in your videos :)", "comment_date": "2022-05-12T18:37:16Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Matt Hendricks", "comment_text": "Cool.

Or it could just be this one universe, is it just this one growing evolving changing universe?

A black hole is a simple object, described by its mass, angular momentum, and electrical charge. Supermassive black holes are typically electrically neutral, so their mass and angular momentum parameters determine their gravitational fields. The gravitational field of a black hole determines how the black hole bend light rays inwards and thus how they appear to an observer on Earth. Light passing near the black hole is deflected by the strong gravitational field, producing a black hole shadow, a dark region that is often encircled by a bright light ring\u2014whose size and shape correlate directly from the black hole\u2019s mass and angular momentum.<br><br>The 3 orange regions in the accretion disk around the black hole is light from hot glowing gas. The reason why these regions are glowing more bright, is because you are <b>looking at the side where material is moving towards us.</b> It appears fainter on the side where it is moving away from us.

How about this idea: we have 1-car train, 2 observers (1 on station - Stef, 1 on train - Tracy), and a small light bulb in the centre of the 1-car train that will produce for simplicity 1 short flash of light with the brightness of a candle at the exact moment when one observer passes another.<br><br>On the ends of the moving 1-car train we&#39;ll have regular photo cameras so it captures the flash and by captured image (angular size and brightness) Tracy can eventually roughly estimate the distance from the camera to the lamp, which would be close to 1/2 of the car length.<br><br>Now let&#39;s run the train a few times with a constant speed each time closer and closer to the speed of light. Obviously with no acceleration between the flash and light reaching both cameras - no matter how fast the train goes the result images captured by 2 cameras will be pretty much the same across all experiments (camera on the front will give almost exact same images whether train goes at different speeds or simply stays in one place. The rear camera would produce a very similar set of almost identical images throughout different experiments since distance to the light source is the same and &quot;The laws of physics are the same in all inertial frames of reference&quot;). And yes - as we know: the simultaneous events in one frame of reference would not be simultaneous in another and vice versa, also the train will shrink more and more the faster it goes from Stef point of view and similarly the flying-by station will shrink for Tracy, but it is not the point here.<br><br>Let&#39;s concentrate on the front camera (facing backwards), which flash of light has to catch up (from stationary Stef point of view). <br><br>We will take Stef&#39;s perspective on it now.Stef can see the exact place where the light finally catches the front camera, which can be far from the station. The faster the train goes the further away from the station this point will be! We can choose the train speed so that the light reaches the front camera 98K light years away (near Ursa Major II Dwarf) from the station!<br>Now if we imagine Stef travel 98K light years away to assume another stationary position (not moving relatively to the original train station on Earth) and hangs in his fancy rocket ship with exact same regular camera in hands and waits for another flash of light coming from our ongoing periodic experiments, if he manages to speed-up his camera inside his stationary ship-lab so that camera sensor is flying away from the original light source at the exact same speed as the camera on the train, then his camera would produce exact same result as the camera on the train, which is regular image of small lamp only few meters away from the lense(!), bright enough to see all it&#39;s details!!! Basically you need to move the camera fast enough from the observed object to squeeze the space (up to the whole universe going almost as flat as a sheet of paper!)<br><br>And this is mind blowing! If Stef sitting far-far away and trying to take a picture with his camera without moving it (regular way), then only 1 or 2 photons per years will hit is lense, while if he moves camera fast enough away from the observed light source then suddenly billions of photons end up inside his lense (as if he&#39;s standing 1/2 train car length away from the source).<br><br>What if he now turns this upgraded &quot;fast-moving-sensor-camera&quot; FMSC towards the Sun while standing on Earth and calculates sensor move speed so that it takes a picture as if 1 mile away from the Sun surface? Will it suddenly completely burn the camera (one can think of fancy lighter which allows you to smoke from the Sun no matter how far)?<br><br>Also we don&#39;t have to actually move real camera inside our &quot;stationary&quot; lab, instead our &quot;fancy sensor&quot; can be implemented as a simple stream of ionized particles accelerated to the desired constant speed traveling away from the observed object at any desired speed, we only need to make them excited (or to loose pre-excited state) if photons from the observed object hit our stream of particles and then detect it somehow in the stationary lab.<br><br>Also for the stationary remote observed objects we don&#39;t have to try to invent the whole &quot;moving away sensor&quot;. We have constant stream of photons from the remote object (not just 1 flash), for example some star or some galaxy. Thus we can &quot;scan&quot; our view field pixel by pixel slowly using one fast particle moving in a loop with controlled speed and somewhat controlled position. Btw, due to uncertainty principle (which says: we cannot know both the position and speed of a particle) we can use lenses in our &quot;camera&quot; and we can make our &quot;sensor area&quot; as large as we want (for example instead of trying to make a sensor area around 1 square centimeter as inside our eye, we can blow up the sensor screen area to few meters by meters) , so we can get any desired &quot;resolution&quot;, thus the uncertainty principle is not a problem.<br><br>Cheers,<br>Dmitry Shevkoplyas", "comment_date": "2022-05-12T15:38:26Z", "likes_count": 9}, {"comment_by": "Kerry Russell", "comment_text": "Can this send the Great Pacific Garbage Patch into Sagittarius A*?
