[{"comment_by": "James Reedy", "comment_text": "Speak simply, Heat travels well through metals, better through aluminum than through copper, better through aluminum than iron, with the same in mind the thing you have not done is use the weighted wire in a below freezing environment. Because at each end of the wire it is conducting heat, at the block of ice it is cooling the wire, this is an active process. The active process in this case includes a constituent that has a temperature above 32f, = test fail &quot;Ice under pressure, must be tested by &quot;RRESSURE&quot; alone.&quot; So now you have to test it in a freezing vacuum. Oh wait, you can&#39;t. In a proper vacuum there would be no gravity and so this test is dependent and subjective. You could put a couple stepper motors on a really slow pull to see if it melts the ice. But you will need ultra close up high speed to see that it&#39;s not microscopic flakes breaking off and melting.

The melting point of ice decreases by about 1C for each 133 ATM of pressure, which is a colossal amount for just a one degree change in melting point.<br><br>The wire trick works since at room temperature the block of ice is essentially 0C (rapidly melting!) and the tiny delta afforded by the &quot;pressure&quot; on the wire does decrease the melting point enough for it to melt through the ice. For example, two 2kg weights on a copper wire lower the melting point by about 0.12C!  Try the same experiment in a freezer and it would fail completely without colossal mass applied to the wire.  Ergo, any example that tries to explain skater&#39;s blade pressure on ice as the reason when the ice is below 0C is utterly incorrect. The &quot;compressing snow in your hands&quot; example is completely ridiculous since you cannot apply the tiniest fraction of the required pressure to lower the melting point in any significant way....<br><br>Basically, at almost any temperature, ice has a very strange property where the surface is in a near-liquid state and that is by far the largest influence on surface friction.", "comment_date": "2021-09-19T18:26:02Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "inbooktechno", "comment_text": "It will melt due to heat going through easier in copper wire but fishing line seems for ages but the fastest heat conductor goes in 0.36 seconds thanks", "comment_date": "2021-09-05T13:14:16Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Bryan Jones", "comment_text": "It so old, but both the same, since pressure is the same.", "comment_date": "2021-07-19T04:57:02Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Akhil Agrawal", "comment_text": "i think fishing line", "comment_date": "2021-06-06T15:26:17Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Politics - RealityTV", "comment_text": "only 331 comments", "comment_date": "2021-04-08T05:11:55Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Sharcc", "comment_text": "If I had a nickle for every time a different 9 year old Veritasium video about Regelation appeared in my recommended I&#39;d have 2 nickles, which isn&#39;t a lot but it&#39;s strange it happened twice.", "comment_date": "2021-04-07T20:48:58Z", "likes_count": 229}, {"comment_by": "wise wise", "comment_text": "both", "comment_date": "2021-04-02T11:18:48Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Chandrabhushan Singh", "comment_text": "I time traveling to 9 years ago", "comment_date": "2021-03-29T06:28:45Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Buttered Timbers", "comment_text": "Haven&#39;t seen many older Veritasium videos, its nice to know they were so high quality even 10 years ago", "comment_date": "2021-03-14T22:30:16Z", "likes_count": 2}, {"comment_by": "Altie-axe", "comment_text": "Copper", "comment_date": "2021-03-05T13:53:38Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Zayn Khan", "comment_text": "Fishing", "comment_date": "2021-02-28T15:02:01Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Kosz Gaming", "comment_text": "Fishing line", "comment_date": "2021-02-26T12:51:02Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Mohamad Alrashed", "comment_text": "He had a heavier Aussie accent at the time", "comment_date": "2021-02-25T09:06:26Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Nazar Hnid", "comment_text": "Old but gold, you did it in 2011 :-)", "comment_date": "2021-02-11T16:29:07Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "EspaDo", "comment_text": "Youtube just likes Old vids", "comment_date": "2021-01-29T23:11:26Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Buri13", "comment_text": "RIP annotations", "comment_date": "2021-01-25T21:20:42Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Diogo Pinheiro", "comment_text": "Copper", "comment_date": "2021-01-25T01:27:16Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Shred Epic Gnar", "comment_text": "Humble beginnings dude.
