And if you&#39;re saying that we can find 50% of the matter up till now and because of the lightning technique we are now able to detect the other 50% of the matter, which is in between galaxies (the so-called WHIM) this adds to the total sum of the matter from the Big Bang and now we can account for 100% of the matter! - this leaves me to believe that there are no galaxies that have already escaped our vision reach to the point we can no longer see them.

Like spokes on a wheel, with the earth being the central point. If the stars and light sources were homogenously scattered in a perfect sphere around the earth such that a beam of light passed through all matter in the universe before it reached you, then this would be a good measurement, but it isn&#39;t, and thus, there may be no light sources that pass through some of the matter that exist out there, especially if there is matter beyond the farthest light source that exist on the fringes of this sphere; an outer sphere of matter with no light source behind it, so to speak. Accounting for the curving of light by gravity, it seems possible that light could even bend around certain matter such that an incident ray of light never reaches us.  Lastly, the edge of the universe that we can see depends is dependent on the speed of light and the amount of time that has passed since that light was emitted. If the universe is 14 something billions years old, we can only see light from a distance equal to the distance the speed of light can travel in those 14 billion years; anything 15 billion light years away would not have reached us until another billion years from now, and thus your calculations of the total matter in the universe will continue to grow each year.  If the edge of the universe is truly 14 billion light years away, we are only seeing the light from the very beginning of it&#39;s existence (it will be another 14 billion yrs before we see the what exists on that edge in 2021 Earth time), and won&#39;t know until at least several more thousand or million years go by to confirm nothing exists further out.", "comment_date": "2021-03-01T04:35:14Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "GodmyX", "comment_text": "Thanks!", "comment_date": "2021-02-27T20:14:45Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Trippin on febreeze", "comment_text": "<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kp_kqamkYpw&amp;t=8m23s\">8:23</a> Great skiing there", "comment_date": "2021-02-27T00:30:50Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Bas", "comment_text": "dark energy makes up 68% of the universe<br><br>disappointed!!!", "comment_date": "2021-02-26T22:31:31Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "xyz", "comment_text": "This is bouncer", "comment_date": "2021-02-26T17:47:53Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Premanshu Singh", "comment_text": "<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kp_kqamkYpw&amp;t=2m07s\">2:07</a><br>I watched in a Ted talk about the formation and history of universe ...<br><br>It said First few maloom years only Forces formed and then after that formed the first Matter...<br><br>And as it challenged my fundamental Knowledge about the Existence of Force alone ...<br><br>But that was it so...

My take as a Christian is that there&#39;s a lot of really good learning to be done, and we&#39;ve only scratched the surface of the universe God created. I&#39;m looking forward to wondering and learning how He put it together. I suspect that the inability to imagine alternate models for the cosmos comes from hubris, not humility.

That is on them to feel that way but you could have left that comment of division out and just praised the scientific community on being right without putting anyone down. But hey you got it now!

These seeds will then produce the kinds of plants and trees from which they came.\u201d And that is what happened. 12 The land produced vegetation\u2014all sorts of seed-bearing plants, and trees with seed-bearing fruit. Their seeds produced plants and trees of the same kind. And God saw that it was good.<br><br>13 And evening passed and morning came, marking the third day.<br><br>14 Then God said, \u201cLet lights appear in the sky to separate the day from the night.

He also made the stars. 17 God set these lights in the sky to light the earth, 18 to govern the day and night, and to separate the light from the darkness.

Let the skies be filled with birds of every kind.\u201d 21 So God created great sea creatures and every living thing that scurries and swarms in the water, and every sort of bird\u2014each producing offspring of the same kind.

The equation for finding gravity on a celestial planet is to calculate its Mass , the Magnetic field, and Atmospheric pressure which should equal Gravity or MBPa = G for short. I would also like to add that my theory includes that black holes are giant magnetic pulse fields that have imploded into existence after the magnetic field of a star have collapsed in itself.

These instruments have detected light from events that occurred only 150 million years after the Big Bang. I get that.<br><br>So we arrive here, in this part of the universe and we point a telescope in some direction and collect that light. If matter moves slower than light, how did we get here, to this point in the universe, BEFORE the light from the big bang got here?  We gathered this very old light in telescopes and analysed that data to come to the conclusion that we are witnessing the light from events that occurred when the very first galaxies were beginning to form from the primordial clouds of hydrogen released very near to the beginning of time and space. But how did we get here, to this point in space, first? <br><br>I understand collecting light from events millions of years ago. Light takes a long time to travel across the vast distances of interstellar space. But collecting the light from billions of years ago? 14.55 billion years ago to be more precise?<br><br>It took 14.7 billion years for us to get here, in this part of our expanding universe. Did not the light from the big bang precede us? And if we know where to point a telescope to peer into the distant past, are we looking towards the center of the expanding universe, or out to the edge? If we can gather the light coming to us from the center of the universe (which is light that is 14.7B minus 150M years old) that means we got here BEFORE the light. And there must be, at some point in that direction, only DARKNESS, no light coming to us, because the light on the other side of the center of the universe has to travel FARTHER than 14.7 billion light years to where we are, and is spreading outward from that central point, travelling for the last 14.7 billion years. How does it get here after we do? And, at what point do we find the darkness, that area farther away from us than the center of the universe, where light must take more than the age of the universe to reach us? <br><br>Our universe is expanding at the speed of light. Has been for 14.7 billion years. The width of the universe then, is the speed of light * 14.7 billion years * 2 = 2.78139535 \u00d7 10^26 meters.<br><br>That is approximately 2,781,395,350,000,000,000,000 Kilometers from one side of the Universe to the other side.

I mean, the goal of a scientist is largely to discover and understand, right? In order to know they&#39;re on the right track, they often need to test their understanding. Either by doing some math or performing some experiment, they sometimes want to check their work, and do something from which they think they can accurately predict the result. While those particular tests can be intriguing or illuminating if the results were unexpected (especially since an incorrect assertion can often result in pointing one in the right direction), if those results are always not what was expected, then it probably means they&#39;re not learning anything about what they&#39;re studying. So I think you&#39;re partially right, but I don&#39;t know by how much, haha. Because scientists can&#39;t really know when an unexpected result is more valuable than an expected one, it might be more accurate to say that scientists typically try to suspend their sense of value in being right or wrong, while non-scientists are specifically seeking expected outcomes or being right, in order to prove what they assume they already know.", "comment_date": "2020-08-04T19:19:48Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "johntp2", "comment_text": "This is a &quot;triumph&quot; to the very few individuals who have careers dependent on this type of research.

Take one line and make a square. It would have sides 1 inch long so that 1 x 1 = 1 square inch. Now take the other 4 inch line and make a circle. It would have the circumference of 4 inches .calculate the area and you get 1.273 .so even though the circle circumfrance is equal too the squares perimeter , the circle comtains 27% more area. Any relation? Which brings me to another i know off limits allready been proven im unworthy i know i know but but Einstein E=mc2 and the part where he multiplys the speed of light by itself is the same as multiplying 1 x 1 equales 1.273 if your a circle and the way i see it light radiates in all directions at the speed of light and even if you block all that light so that only one photon escapes .after one second that photon is a point on a radius equal to the velocity of one second of light not a square..  infact you cant even get the speed of light to fill the square no matter what amount of time you chose or what size you make the <a href=\"http://square.you/\">square.you</a> cant square a circle. One last thing that might drive the nail in and bring this to the front where serious thinking takes place but do this make a circle and fill that circle with the velocity of light .pretend the circle is 1 second of time. It fills the circle perfect .simple.  now draw a box around that circle so that the circle is touching the middle of the sides of the square in 4 places. Now fill the box with one second of light.

Has anyone stopped to think that maybe there isn&#39;t some kind of exotic form of matter that can&#39;t be seen, touched, or detected? Maybe it&#39;s something MUCH simpler than that. If energy is the same thing as matter (that is what Einstein proved with E=mc2) then maybe we should be looking for other forms of energy, like ELECTRICITY. I NEVER heard astronomers talk about the electric currents in the universe. I have them instantly dismiss the idea of an electric universe tho. But maybe their idea of the electric universe is wrong. We KNOW that magnetic and electronic forces go hand in hand, that is exactly how we make all electricity on this planet. And since most of the bodies we find in our own solar system are involved with magnetic fields, then why wouldn&#39;t they also have electrical fields? The Earth has a &#39;magneto-sphere&#39; correct? Then why can&#39;t it have an &#39;electro-sphere&#39;? (I am WAY over simplifying this of course) If i can take a few magnets and run them through coils of wire i get electricity, but the magnetic field of Earth doesn&#39;t create electricity? If it did then this energy would have mass, correct? (i&#39;m guessing everyone will say no) Well maybe there is enough electrical current/charge throughout the universe to make up for all this &#39;missing&#39; mass.... and what about plasma? That reacts to magnetic fields, right? Well maybe all this electrical current is containing plasma around the galaxies. It&#39;s just not the super energetic/hot plasma we usually think of (and it&#39;s not emitting light) and it could be surrounding the galaxies like a cocoon, causing it to spin the way we see (the way astronomers say &#39;dark matter&#39; surround them) - this could fix the whole dark matter problem the way I see it - but what do I know right?

If we consider the hypothesis that the CMB is what we assume it to be, and then test that hypothesis, and find it does not predict the amount of baryons that we would expect, then ideally that hypothesis would have just been falsified. Instead, the hypothesis is held to be true, and the failure to detect what it predicts isn&#39;t treated as an instance of falsification, but instead an as an instance of something missing that should be there (this is largely the same reason that dark matter and dark energy have been predicted). Of course, this is a perfect example of the fact that the idealised notion of scientific falsifiability isn&#39;t actually how science works. Theories are falsified all the time, and kept around regardless. A more accurate description of how science works is that there is some kind of selection procedure that selects from available theories to see which one is the &quot;best&quot;; if a theory is falsified, it doesn&#39;t matter if there isn&#39;t another theory around that is then considered &quot;better&quot;. Of course, the problem of what makes something better can be quite unscientific. For example, with the missing baryon problem, there was another hypothesis that accurately predicted the observed energy density of the CMB, without introducing a missing baryon problem, by arguing that the CMB was the result of a specific class of aged star output, rather than the result of the Epoch of last scattering from the big bang. Unfortunately, a significant reason why some theories aren&#39;t considered &quot;better&quot; is due simply to fashion and group think.<br><br>It&#39;s important to note that warm-hot models of the universe are not hugely accepted, so detecting so called &quot;missing matter&quot; on the basis of such a model isn&#39;t exactly strong evidence. I haven&#39;t read the paper, but I would bet that the data can only be interpreted to cover the missing baryon problem if the warm-hot model is assumed to be true, as this is the way most of cosmology works right now (too many free variables that can&#39;t be controlled in a direct fashion).<br><br>Here&#39;s a very interesting fact: the entire basis of modern cosmology, of which all observational measurements are unavoidably tainted by, due to the necessity of strong data interpretation in cosmology, are based on the notion that distance correlated redshift is due to a Doppler shift like effect (i.e. things are redshifted because they are expanding away from us. This is another instance where it&#39;s sort of just been maintained because it&#39;s the &quot;best&quot; explanation we had at the time; but the actual  direct evidence that conforms to this explanation is in reality closely matched by direct evidence that falsifies this explanation. And in general, considering the fact that the entirety of modern cosmology rests on this relationship being true, there has been relatively little work done to actually to directly test it, which can be done using relativity tests.<br><br>It&#39;s all well and good to say that scientists love being wrong; but the inability for professions like cosmology to entertain opposing theories, such as static or steady state models, means that opposing theories are simply never developed well enough, and instead of failed predictions being considered &quot;falsifications&quot;, they are just considered &quot;missing stuff&quot;, in light of the fact that the profession doesn&#39;t entertain other theories enough for them to be developed enough to compete.<br><br>I encourage you to cover some issues with modern cosmology, and underdeveloped opposing theories that don&#39;t produce problems of &quot;missing&quot; stuff. Because if there&#39;s never any competing theories, then a theory by definition can not ever be wrong, simply because of the large interpretation bias in cosmology that doesn&#39;t exist in other sciences that can perform more controlled experiments.<br><br>Scientists shouldn&#39;t be lionised any more than any other group; they&#39;re still flawed people that are susceptible to group think and fashion as with anyone else. The reality is that direct tests of expansion don&#39;t appear to prefer static theories any less than they prefer expansion theories. For example, tolman surface brightness and angular size tests tests only match with expansion if very aggressive and fined tuned galaxy evolution is introduced to account for discrepancies; meanwhile, a static universe fits these test with no need for fine tuning of galaxy evolution.", "comment_date": "2020-08-02T09:05:00Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Infest19", "comment_text": "If the fast radio burst only lasts 1 ms, how can we detect them?

The &quot;Cosmic Background Radiation&quot; seems to disappear if your &quot;detector&quot; is shielded from the oceans by being far enough inland and surrounded by mountains.  Ref: Herouni Radio-Optical Telescope, Yerevan, Armenia. . . no CMBR. . . anywhere.    <br>====================================================================<br>2. Red Shift can not be used for expanding universe arguments. . .  Halton Arp. . . 250 exceptions to the argument. . . the kinds of exemptions that astronomers could not deal with. . . &quot;Red shift&quot; on one side of a galaxy and &quot;Blue Shift&quot; on the the other side of that same galaxy. . .  not physically possible.<br>====================================================================<br>3. There is NO explanation allowing for the compression of any form of Hydrogen gas or any form of Helium gas to the near-metalic levels of compression to create academically acceptable stars. . . they like to spread out but they do NOT like to be compressed.    Try it in any lab and you will come to the same conclusion. There is also NO POSSIBLE EXPLANATION for how the &quot;supposed theoretical process&quot; could have been accomplished isothermically.  IF the theoretic compression process was not &quot;processed&quot; isothermically, you would cross the &quot;trigger temperature&quot; that would light up the Hydrogen as a Hydrogen Bomb. . . exeunt every star that might try an adiabatic compression process.  They would light up as Hydrogen Bombs every time. . . no exceptions. <br>====================================================================<br>4. IF there was a &quot;Big Bang&quot;. . . and that&#39;s a BIG IF. . . the only other candidate for potential star formation would have to be Lithium.  Lithium is solid enough to be something that could be gathered as a core for a first generation star.  But the gasses, Hydrogen or Helium, not possible. <br>===================================================================== <br>5.  Dark Matter is a mathematical construct. . . basically a glorified &quot;fudge factor&quot;.  It doesn&#39;t actually exist.  The math works out just fine.  But that doesn&#39;t mean that an imagined substance is actually there. <br>=====================================================================<br>6. Dark Energy is also a mathematical construct. . . also a glorified &quot;fudge factor&quot;. . . for an &quot;expanding universe&quot; that isn&#39;t actually &quot;expanding&quot;.  <br>=====================================================================<br>7. The matter-antimatter question considered in this video assumes a &quot;Big Bang&quot; in which matter exploded in the Eastern direction and antimatter exploded in the Western direction. . . basically &quot;away&quot; from each other.  IF the Big Bang had not happened as assumed, for purposes of this discussion, the protons and antiprotons would have &quot;eaten&quot; each other. . . ie. . . Big Bang + Big Boing = Big ZERO. . . no universe created.  So if the Big Bang actually did happen, they would have to avoid each other somehow.

Astronomical science has finally started to evolve from this pit full of assumptions built upon fudge factors like their theoretical versions of black holes, dark matter and dark energy, the pendulum has finally started to swing back towards where we were almost 100 years ago before we got off track with this nonsense....<br><br>Gravitational theory has been proven wrong. The universe is made up of and from electro magnetism. Gravity is the weakest force in the universe, the electric force is 100 billion trillion times stronger. Dark Matter and Dark Energy are the glaring scientific flaws that disprove gravitrational theory. In the Electric Universe there is no need for silly made up forces or objects. In the Electric Universe theory it explains there is no such thing as an infinite mass object like a black hole, rather these objects are more accurately described plasmoids and act as the Electro Magnetic heart of a galaxy and explains why no matter where we look in the galaxy stars that are 100s of millions of light years from their galactic centers rotate evenly with the stars that are light years form the center. Which is IMPOSSIBLE if your basis is Gravitational theory because there is no gravitational lag observed! It also explains why we have discovered stars forming within a couple light years of our &quot;Super Massive Black Hole&quot; which is another supposed impossibility by Grav theory. Due to this huge error in modern day astronomy, they have invented some more make believe physics in dark energy and dark matter. <br><br>EU explains why there are big electro magnetic beams from the Sun directly to the poles of each major planet in our solar system. EU laughs at theory of gravtiational collapse and proves the sun is not just I big ball of gas that has an outer shell hotter than any other part of it. <br><br>It is time for scientists holding onto last centuries false beliefs for dear life to stop with the hypotheticals and come to a theory in which every single aspect of our universe has been proven over and over again with groundbreaking studies at labs in colleges and research firms alike. The truth is the universe is Plasma based, and that Electro Magnetic forces are what cause EVERYTHING we observe in space. <br><br>Electric Universe Theory shows that the universe and everything in it is connected just like the neurons in a brain. Gravitational theory claims we are just a bunch of lumps if dust that were accidentally created and happen to be spinning while floating through empty nothingness. Which again completely ignores the fact that Gravity is an attractive force and that is all. Nothing about Gravity explains why objects in space spin. Unless you realize the fact that what is interpreted as Gravity is nothing more then an electrical magnetic effect. <br><br>ThunderboltsProject posts the latest breakthroughs in real Astronomical Science: <a href=\"https://youtu.be/rZspAmawIpc\">https://youtu.be/rZspAmawIpc</a>", "comment_date": "2020-08-01T18:44:48Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Maneater 901749", "comment_text": "Did I understand the video?

So, if God gave you justice right away, would you be innocent or guilty? Obviously guilty. Heaven or hell? Obviously hell because you are a criminal in God\u2019s eyes. Don\u2019t ask for forgiveness, try it in court: Judge, I raped a woman and killed her, but I\u2019m so sorry and I won\u2019t do it again. You would still go to jail because you shouldn\u2019t do it again and you should be sorry. So is there any hope? Yes, there is! Out of love and mercy, God became a human being, Jesus Christ.Jesus lived a sinless life and finally died on the cross to bear the punishment we deserve. His resurrection proved that His death was enough to pay our penalty, the penalty for our sins. When someone pays your fine, the judge can leave you, dismiss your case, it\u2019s the same with God. Jesus paid our penalty and in order to accept the free gift of salvation from God, we must believe (have faith in Jesus for our salvation, His finished work on the Cross). That&#39;s it!

Then he mentions when shortly after the big bang and the first particles were forming and mentions the cmb or Cosmic Microwave Background. Lots of scientists use this in their fields of study.
