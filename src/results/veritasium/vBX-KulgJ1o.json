A random guess at the answer would be 50/50 and the extra-credit payoff is 2:1, so I&#39;m offering them a good bet. They can also look as some cards from each deck in order to improve their chances of getting the correct answer. However, there is a points-cost for every card they look at. Thus looking at cards reduces their potential winnings if they are correct and increases their loss if they are wrong. Strategy is completely up to students who choose to take the bet. In my experience, students who apply the statistical principles from class can be correct about 90% of the time and still make some profit. A few brave souls just recognize that it&#39;s a good bet and take a guess without doing any analysis.  It&#39;s been fascinating to see different approaches.

Of course, as long as you know it&#39;s legit, you&#39;re gonna end up with roughly 500 houses by the end of it.", "comment_date": "2022-07-27T18:01:17Z", "likes_count": 17}, {"comment_by": "Zirizo", "comment_text": "I think a bit more than half a million saw it", "comment_date": "2022-07-27T16:12:02Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "jarno", "comment_text": "These People not taking the bet are just idiots \ud83d\ude02", "comment_date": "2022-07-27T14:32:43Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Potatounyum_2", "comment_text": "I would do it", "comment_date": "2022-07-27T14:24:09Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Curedboiii", "comment_text": "Why is He in  australia?", "comment_date": "2022-07-27T13:49:18Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "sergeyivanovish85", "comment_text": "Am i the only one who would just do the bet at 10/10 :D", "comment_date": "2022-07-27T13:18:43Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "marGO", "comment_text": "CHATSWOOD", "comment_date": "2022-07-27T12:45:13Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Lubomir Radev", "comment_text": "Idiots...", "comment_date": "2022-07-27T12:38:26Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Enoch Lui", "comment_text": "Well the bigger experiment in this video is perhaps when he mentioned how he would only profit off this video if there is over 500k views.<br>Looking Now that it has over 6.5m views, he proved that his risk paid off.", "comment_date": "2022-07-27T11:58:54Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "PogsterPlays", "comment_text": "It&#39;s probably because humans focus more on negative information than positive information.", "comment_date": "2022-07-27T11:46:21Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Aayan Mohammad", "comment_text": "cool he is in Austraila", "comment_date": "2022-07-27T11:13:29Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Alfred Wong", "comment_text": "My brain would tell me it&#39;s rigged because nobody would be offering more money on a bet than what they could receive in the bet if it was up to a even chance of 50 50.", "comment_date": "2022-07-27T10:29:37Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Ramzataz", "comment_text": "Now, time people learnt that financial asset trading is NOT gambling because the same concept is applied.

First, let&#39;s generalize the problem by assuming the loss is fixed and equal to 10 dollars and the gain is some X amount of dollars. The mathematical expectation of the gain in one game is (X-10)/2, so there is no purpose of the game when X&lt;10. When X is just somewhat greater than 10, many people deny the game because they are more afraid of losses rater than the small expected gain. At some point everyone will accept the game, for example, if X is a million. Thus, the first branch of research is to find the distribution of the people who agreed depending on X. Here comes the other issue that there is a hidden parameter of the game which is an averaged salary of people. Indeed, 10 dollars have any prescribed meaning only compared to other amount, like monthly salary, price of a sandwich or Uber ride or whatever. If people are offered to win 100 dollars or lose 10 it is not identically equal to win 100 thousand and lose 10, simply because many people don&#39;t have 10 thousand to bet. Finally, the game completely changes when a set of many coins flips is considered. Since the mathematical expectation grows linearly while the standard deviation grows as square root, there will be always favorable to play, as the number of flips grows, even if one needs to bet non-existing million dollars they don&#39;t have.", "comment_date": "2021-12-21T22:24:41Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Kernel", "comment_text": "This is just risk aversion.", "comment_date": "2021-12-21T00:50:27Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Hawk of the North", "comment_text": "I was jumping on the 10$ bet and I coulda got you to go to 50$ See there I lost out on a 50$.. lmao", "comment_date": "2021-12-20T19:28:24Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Andrew Bugbee", "comment_text": "For 2-1 odds, I would easily take that bet, but being suspicious, I would want to use my coin and I get to flip it.", "comment_date": "2021-12-20T17:15:40Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Michael Mwesigwa", "comment_text": "300", "comment_date": "2021-12-20T14:45:16Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "jayessemar", "comment_text": "id just take the bet $10 for $10 coin flip", "comment_date": "2021-12-20T01:31:01Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "e", "comment_text": "Thats Australian money", "comment_date": "2021-12-19T01:53:18Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Cobus Belterman", "comment_text": "&quot;The moon landing hoax&quot; ???", "comment_date": "2021-12-18T17:32:06Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Don T.

See that you are not alarmed, for this must take place, but the end is not yet. For nation will rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom, and there will be famines and earthquakes in various places. All these are but the beginning of the birth pains. \u201cThen they will deliver you up to tribulation and put you to death, and you will be hated by all nations for my name\u2019s sake. And then many will fall away and betray one another and hate one another. And many false prophets will arise and lead many astray. And because lawlessness will be increased, the love of many will grow cold. But the one who endures to the end will be saved. And this gospel of the kingdom will be proclaimed throughout the whole world as a testimony to all nations, and then the end will come.</i></b> <br><br><b><i>\u201cSo when you see the abomination of desolation spoken of by the prophet Daniel, standing in the holy place ( let the reader understand), then let those who are in Judea flee to the mountains. Let the one who is on the housetop not go down to take what is in his house, and let the one who is in the field not turn back to take his cloak. And alas for women who are pregnant and for those who are nursing infants in those days! Pray that your flight may not be in winter or on a Sabbath. For then there will be great tribulation, such as has not been from the beginning of the world until now, no, and never will be. And if those days had not been cut short, no human being would be saved. But for the sake of the elect those days will be cut short. Then if anyone says to you, \u2018Look, here is the Christ!\u2019 or \u2018There he is!\u2019 do not believe it. For false christs and false prophets will arise and perform great signs and wonders, so as to lead astray, if possible, even the elect. See, I have told you beforehand. So, if they say to you, \u2018Look, he is in the wilderness,\u2019 do not go out. If they say, \u2018Look, he is in the inner rooms,\u2019 do not believe it. For as the lightning comes from the east and shines as far as the west, so will be the coming of the Son of Man. Wherever the corpse is, there the vultures will gather.</i></b> <br><br><b><i>\u201cImmediately after the tribulation of those days the sun will be darkened, and the moon will not give its light, and the stars will fall from heaven, and the powers of the heavens will be shaken. Then will appear in heaven the sign of the Son of Man, and then all the tribes of the earth will mourn, and they will see the Son of Man coming on the clouds of heaven with power and great glory. And he will send out his angels with a loud trumpet call, and they will gather his elect from the four winds, from one end of heaven to the other.</i></b> <br><br><b><i>\u201cFrom the fig tree learn its lesson: as soon as its branch becomes tender and puts out its leaves, you know that summer is near.

Heaven and earth will pass away, but my words will not pass away.</i></b> <br><br><b><i>\u201cBut concerning that day and hour no one knows, not even the angels of heaven, nor the Son, but the Father only. For as were the days of Noah, so will be the coming of the Son of Man. For as in those days before the flood they were eating and drinking, marrying and giving in marriage, until the day when Noah entered the ark, and they were unaware until the flood came and swept them all away, so will be the coming of the Son of Man. Then two men will be in the field; one will be taken and one left. Two women will be grinding at the mill; one will be taken and one left. Therefore, stay awake, for you do not know on what day your Lord is coming. But know this, that if the master of the house had known in what part of the night the thief was coming, he would have stayed awake and would not have let his house be broken into. Therefore you also must be ready, for the Son of Man is coming at an hour you do not expect. \u201cWho then is the faithful and wise servant, whom his master has set over his household, to give them their food at the proper time? Blessed is that servant whom his master will find so doing when he comes. Truly, I say to you, he will set him over all his possessions. But if that wicked servant says to himself, \u2018My master is delayed,\u2019 and begins to beat his fellow servants and eats and drinks with drunkards, the master of that servant will come on a day when he does not expect him and at an hour he does not know and will cut him in pieces and put him with the hypocrites.

Whoever believes in him is not condemned, but whoever does not believe is condemned already, because he has not believed in the name of the only Son of God. And this is the judgment: the light has come into the world, and people loved the darkness rather than the light because their works were evil.

For a 20/80 proposition, you want at least a expected value of &gt; 1.15.

If it comes up tails more than heads, you pay him the same. There are no hidden tricks. It\u2019s a fair bet \u2014 safe to take, if you\u2019re looking for a 50/50 chance.<br><br>Now, imagine the same offer, except that instead of flipping the coin, the other patron tells you he\u2019s going to spin it. In fact, he\u2019ll even let you provide the penny, just to guarantee there is no funny business. Twenty-five spins and if it comes up heads more often than tails, he\u2019ll give you $20 again. But if tails comes up more often, you owe him $20.<br><br>Fair bet? Not if Persi Diaconis is right.<br><br>Diaconis is a professor of mathematics and statistics at Stanford University and, formerly, a professional magician. While his claim to fame is determining how many times a deck of cards must be shuffled in order to give a mathematically random result (it\u2019s either five or seven, depending on your criteria), he\u2019s also dabbled in the world of coin games. What he and his fellow researchers discovered (here\u2019s a PDF of their paper) is that most games of chance involving coins aren\u2019t as even as you\u2019d think. For example, even the 50/50 coin toss really isn\u2019t 50/50 \u2014 it\u2019s closer to 51/49, biased toward whatever side was up when the coin was thrown into the air.<br><br>But more incredibly, as reported by Science News, spinning a penny, in this case one with the Lincoln Memorial on the back, gives even more pronounced odds \u2014 the penny will land tails side up roughly 80 percent of the time. The reason: the side with Lincoln\u2019s head on it is a bit heavier than the flip side, causing the coin\u2019s center of mass to lie slightly toward heads. The spinning coin tends to fall toward the heavier side more often, leading to a pronounced number of extra \u201ctails\u201d results when it finally comes to rest.<br><br>Because the coins typically pick up dirt and oils over time, trying the experiment at home may not yield such a large percentage of \u201ctails\u201d over \u201cheads\u201d \u2014 but a relatively new coin should still give you noticeable results.<br><br>Written by Dan Lewis", "comment_date": "2021-06-20T13:21:05Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Bart De Bie", "comment_text": "If there\u2019s one thing that we know for sure, it\u2019s that a series of coin tosses will come out half heads and half tails. Wrong. Coin flips aren\u2019t completely independent. True, the coin doesn\u2019t know what side it landed on last time, so if you got five heads in a row, you aren\u2019t overdue a tails. But the side that faces upwards when you make the flip influences the side it\u2019ll land on. Researchers from Stanford University and University of California, Santa Cruz watched coin flips with a high-speed camera. They found that if you flip a coin head-side up you have a 51 per cent chance of catching it head-side up. And, for some people, the chance can be as high as 60 per cent depending on exactly how they flip the coin. What\u2019s more, if you spin the coin, the lightest side will face up more often than the heaviest. This tends to be tails, but it depends on the exact coin you use.

The only other company that I guess beats it is Food (and even that might be newer than Math if you buy from a company that was established in the 1800s or newer like most companies). Spending your $10 on anything means you will only get your $10 back no matter what you spend it on with the risk of it breaking as soon as you get it or it not being as good as you thought it would be. It could also be outdated by the time you purchase it resulting in your loss and because it didn\u2019t malfunction you cannot get your refund (because the company you purchased it from is very strict). While fear is a logical response to the unknown it is also backed by an illogical reasoning. When he made the odds in the person\u2019s favor by bumping up the chances to 100 at $20 for the max prize he even said that your chances of even losing money after 100 coin tosses is less than 1% and people let their fear consume them.", "comment_date": "2021-05-16T16:28:49Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "S.

If you&#39;re being offered better odds than the TRUE odds, then it&#39;s a bet, if you&#39;re not, then you leave it.

Simplistically this is what bookies call their margins and why over the long haul they will VERY rarely lose.<br><br>If however they offered ANYTHING over even money, then the simple answer is you take the bet, when the guy is offering you 2/1 (his 20 for your 10) you snap his hand off and this is what my years of playing cards has taught me, if you choose wrong and lose your 10 quid, you&#39;ve 100% still made the right decision. This is a good lesson, not just in gambling but in life. A pro poker player will tell you that cards is mostly a maths game and not to be results orientated, which means that although you made the right decision and got the wrong outcome, don&#39;t let it distract you from doing the exact same thing the next time the same situation arises. This also applies in reverse, again cards/gambling mirroring life, You can make terrible decisions and get good results, it doesn&#39;t mean you&#39;ve made the right choice and in the long run those bad choices will have an adverse effect on your life or on the case of cards, your bankroll.<br><br>In short, play the odds (every one of these people should have taken the bet over even money) and don&#39;t be result orientated.", "comment_date": "2021-04-06T22:13:18Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "leafster", "comment_text": "haha stonks", "comment_date": "2021-04-06T17:44:03Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Pandaboss500 pummer", "comment_text": "10k", "comment_date": "2021-04-06T08:50:29Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Rayne Michelle", "comment_text": "You&#39;ve had more than 10 times the half a million people you needed to watch this video.

Recognizing when something has a positive expected value isn&#39;t actually that easy.  People overestimate the odds of stock buys, startups, etc...<br>- Someone offering you something with a positive expected value (and a sufficiently high chance that the expected value is actually reasonable) always sounds like a scam because why offer it to us when you could just do it yourself?<br>- The expected value shouldn&#39;t be looked at purely from a dollar perspective but from a utility perspective.  $20 often is not double the utility of $10.  Similarly, as someone in the video pointed out, if you are bankrupt/can&#39;t afford to cover running this multiple times then if you do lose you can&#39;t keep participating... so it&#39;s not necessarily an option of running it 0 or 100 times.  If you can only afford one net failure you have a greater than 50% chance of losing money (as opposed to the &lt;1/2000 mentioned in video)<br><br>- Remember that positive expected value isn&#39;t sufficient.

This helps explain the welfare trap. The only counter argument is that in some circumstances poorer people are more materialistic due to feeling low in the social hierarchy and so may spend money of extravagant items. However, even for this to be the case they must least have enough money for items they deem to be necessities first. Maybe people climb in their wealth while maintaining this conservative attitude. This is why asking poorer people to take more risks to become richer is a bad concept. In addition something to note about the people in this experiment. They may not have a clear shortage of money. However they may only feel comfortable walking around in the streets if they have a dozen or so $ to potentially spend. So when you ask them to risk $10 you may actually be asking for almost 100% of their money at that given moment and therefore they would not like to risk feeling vulnerable and cashless which is a scaled down but true example of that I explained earlier with peoples lives on the line.", "comment_date": "2020-06-18T11:28:58Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Tiny Ford", "comment_text": "And yet if people can win millions with a 0.00000001% chance they will give the 10 dollars up", "comment_date": "2020-06-18T10:18:05Z", "likes_count": 5}, {"comment_by": "Tiny Ford", "comment_text": "I think the girl with the \u201cI don\u2019t have 10 bucks\u201d sums it up.

However if the roles are reversed you might consider the gain as a mitigator to your current state of perpetual loss. Hence making the gain offset the loss by making the future loss feel less like a loss. This is one of the reasons to why we have gambling adictions as one might feel that they have to recuperate their previous losses before they can stop gambling. And if they actually DO recuperate their loss they are even more likely to bet that &quot;final time&quot; again due to the adrenaline and endorphine release coming from their previous wins creating a false sense of certainty regarding their future &quot;win&quot;.<br><br>This plays a role in the social structure surrounding the person in question as the enviroment may have a similar effect as the gambling issue.

When evaluating the expected value of a bet, you need to take the geometric mean, not the arithmetic mean, of the outcomes. Consider the ten dollars that the bettor stands to lose as the &quot;stake&quot; of the bet. The bettor can then either a.) Recoup their stake plus some profit, or b.) Lose their stake. This means that the two outcomes are some positive number (let&#39;s say 20 dollars) or zero dollars. The geometric mean would then be sqrt(0 * 20) or 0 dollars. Thus, in general a person can expect to receive zero dollars from this bet, <b>after</b> their ten dollar stake. In other words, the expected value of the bet is to lose ten dollars.<br><br>The law of large numbers invocation in the video is also flawed because at some point one party will run out of cash. If, after a streak of ten losses, I run out of money, then I can no longer afford to continue betting, and therefore cannot recoup my losses. This is the same principle as why Martingale betting doesn&#39;t work; people do not have infinite cash stacks.<br><br>Finally, the video does not address the relative utility of the bet value. Ten dollars is probably a not-insignificant amount of money for these people. However, if you were to propose the same bet with the same odds, except the values were 10 cents vs 20 cents, I would expect most people to take the bet. Similarly, a very rich person would probably take the ten dollar bet, simply because ten dollars is much less important to the rich person, relatively speaking, than ten dollars is to an average person.", "comment_date": "2017-05-24T16:44:38Z", "likes_count": 2}, {"comment_by": "Johnboy3641", "comment_text": "I would take that bet right out, you stand to lose as much as me in the first place.", "comment_date": "2017-05-24T15:25:55Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "shadow genius", "comment_text": "A simple way to factor the risk is the take the range of how much is to be won or lost, ( in the case of ten flips at $20 to your $10, the range being $300) and dividing it by the number of events ( ten flips).

The reason I say this is because people know that it&#39;s a 50/50 chance, and after seeing the coin flip twice, they get a feeling like they have a better idea of where it&#39;s going to go: a better than 50/50 chance (i. e. &quot;oh, well it&#39;s landed on tails twice already-- I choose heads&quot; or &quot;oh, well it was heads, then tails-- I&#39;ll choose heads again&quot;). There&#39;s something there that makes us think we have a leg up (or at least it would for me). I&#39;d call it some sort of instinct that involves the law of large numbers. This relates to the hundred flips thing where even though you risk money, there is a very small chance that there will be any lost (if the money offered is increased like it was when you asked people in the video: of course doing it 100 times 10 against 10 still has expected values of winning and losing 50 times- a net gain of 0).<br>Anyway, thanks for the video and the thoughts.", "comment_date": "2017-04-02T17:24:21Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "SnowToast Pro", "comment_text": "&quot;I only gain money from this video if half a million people see it&quot; welp...", "comment_date": "2017-04-02T12:51:39Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Matthias60", "comment_text": "if u put up 16 and me 10 i&#39;ll do it, if we do it 25+ times ;)", "comment_date": "2017-04-02T12:43:22Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "DarkLight", "comment_text": "lol with my luck i will lose all 100 flips", "comment_date": "2017-04-02T11:07:58Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "NuclearLuke", "comment_text": "25$", "comment_date": "2017-04-02T10:52:57Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Liam Adams", "comment_text": "that guy on <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vBX-KulgJ1o&amp;t=1m54s\">1:54</a> is on Nickelodeon", "comment_date": "2017-04-02T09:39:22Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Ashish Sh", "comment_text": "Wait is he in Australia ??", "comment_date": "2017-04-02T02:12:45Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Joni Nurmela", "comment_text": "I would have taken 20 dollars if I had a lot of money but if I had only 10 dollars I risk losing all my money", "comment_date": "2017-04-01T22:10:50Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "David Vickers", "comment_text": "How many are considering the risk/reward aspect of the bet as opposed to not trusting a stranger offering a too good to be true scenario.

Hence in games where this is possible such as poker, you have professionals who earn millions.", "comment_date": "2017-03-05T20:15:58Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Lamby Corn", "comment_text": "Am I teh only one who took the bet in the first one?", "comment_date": "2017-03-05T15:58:51Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Andy Chung", "comment_text": "chatswood people tsk", "comment_date": "2017-03-05T15:20:43Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Callum T", "comment_text": "I see Australian money!", "comment_date": "2017-03-05T14:46:07Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "pr0skis", "comment_text": "Do the same experiment outside the CME and CBOT in Chicago.

There are a number of distinct differences between the thought-experiment shown and the analogy of risks encountered in everyday life.<br><br>First of all, the benefits of doing the bet multiple times ONLY exists because the gain is larger than the risk. If it was only a 10-10 bet then doing it 10 or 100 or even a million times would not increase your odds of coming out ahead, they would remain an average &quot;winnings&quot; of $0, and you would be just as likely to make a profit as you were to loose money. The larger gain makes it more favorable by allowing each win to cancel out more than 1 loss. (there&#39;s also the factor that the odds of winning each round is 50-50, if the odds were against you it could cancel out the larger gain, and likewise if it was in your favor it could make an even, or even lower gain outweigh the risk) This isn&#39;t something that can necessarily be said about every risk encountered in everyday life.<br><br>Second, the series of bets is uniform, the risk gain and odds are the same every time. How often to you encounter the exact same risk every day in life? They&#39;re often quite different, and all to often we don&#39;t even know what the odds are.<br><br>Lastly, is the scale of the loss. A $10 loss is relatively low, doing that 10 or 100 times you&#39;re not likely to need a great deal of &quot;seed money&quot; to cover your initial losses until your wins start to sustain you. But in life, risks are often quite a bit heftier, and it&#39;s a lot less realistic to be able to eat several &quot;losses&quot; until your luck evens out.", "comment_date": "2016-05-08T13:25:15Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "candiduscorvus", "comment_text": "I would take the bet if you let me flip the coin.

They might be cheating or the situation might be somehow rigged. People may not know this on the conscious level, but they feel that most situations do not involve fair chances.<br><br>Seriously, if someeone on the street offers you a game of chance, there is a good reason to believe he might be cheating in some way. That&#39;s what people actually DO in games that seem random or skill-based - some people do that for a living. And the average person either knows, or has grounds to suspect, that.<br><br>I suspect loss aversion in GENERAL might exist for similar reasons - when you take a risk, you might be miscalculating your chances. In most situations in life, expected returns are not 100% or more. When they are, the opportunity may have been already exhausted by other people. There&#39;s a bit of irrationality here, but in many situations in actual life, &quot;too good to be true&quot; opportunities might involve either a mistake, a deception, or both.<br><br>That&#39;s where I see the psychological (and ultimately the evolutionary) reason for playing it safe. In many, many situations you are misled or unaware of circumstances that make the bet unfavourable. I don&#39;t think you incorporated that in your analysis.<br><br>My grandmother used to put it that way: &quot;when two people bet, one is a fool and one is a cheat&quot;. That&#39;s not ALWAYS the case, but that happens, and a good cheat usually is pretty good at disguising the fact (obviously).<br><br>EDIT: there is one more factor in play here, actually. Even assuming fair chances, the benefit (both psychological and in terms of loss/gain calculations) might not be the same as the loss for a number of reasons. Let me take an extreme example. If I bet everything I own on a fair chance of doubling what I have, there are two options. Either I&#39;m broke and I&#39;m in <b>serious</b> trouble, or I become twice as rich. Which is nice, but it is not a change in my life AS drastic as losing everything. In the former situation, my standard of living rapidly drops to the gutter (literally). I might starve to death, be homeless, get sick, any upset in the situation is a REALLY bad thing. In the latter situation, I&#39;m better off, but my life does not change AS drastically by winning as by losing.<br><br>Granted, a 10-dollar bet will not change AS much, so it&#39;s irrational to think of it the same way. But psychologically, a similar principle may apply.<br><br>There is also the issue that we value what we have because we reach a comfortable point of gain and, similarly, we have diminishing results. In theory, betting everything I own on a 51% chance of doubling my belongings and repeating the whole process 50 times is a rational decision [EDIT: make it 30 times. 50 would make for a ridiculous number, and 2^30 would still place it within the limits of world economy]. Mathematically, it makes perfect sense. BUT the best possible outcome is just that I will be super-rich - but I&#39;m not sure if that would be subjectively THAT much better for my life than &quot;just&quot; being a billionaire. Diminishing results, right there. The worst possible outcome is that I will have nothing. And that possibility is very likely - the chance that I will have nothing is 1-(0.51^30), which is pretty much equal to 1. Statistically, I win (I have a small, to the point of being negligible, chance to win, but how MUCH I will win more than offsets that), even though the most probable result is extremely unfavourable.<br><br>What I&#39;m getting at is, the pure mathematical calculation is misleading in that the same (numerically) gain and loss is not essentially equivalent for practical purposes. What we have already gained/accumulated/won/accomplished is, more often than not, to an extent what we had strived for, what we valued and what we felt we needed to be comfortable. A change to depart from that sweet spot might mean a chance to get in a very bad situation vs getting in a situation where we&#39;re happier, but not by much. Such as with my example of &quot;becoming completely broke vs doubling my fortune&quot;. The more you have, and the more you are satisfied with the current situation, the worse that change is.<br><br>Another EDIT: on that note, I would absolutely go for a 50% chance to have 220% return on my ten dollars - but only if I had a reliable way of checking if the chance is truly 50%. For instance, I would insist on using my own coin and being the one to toss it. In <b>that</b> situation, I absolutely agree that turning down the bet is irrational ;)<br><br>Yet another EDIT: and I just noticed the clarification that we&#39;re talking about small gains/losses only. Oh well. The part of my reasoning before the first edit still applies.

Another factor here is that if a stranger comes up to you and offers to bet $20 against $10 at even odds, you strongly suspect that he is up to something, and don&#39;t want to find out the hard way. Still other factors that textbook stats doesn&#39;t take into account: non-monetary rewards such as  he entertainment value or social benefits from playing a game. Another economic factor is the marginal propensity to save, which is behind the multiplier effect. Basically, poor people spend all they earn, because they have no choice. The richer you are, the more you are likely to save - and the present value of savings is greater than the nominal value. So if I pay $1 for a lottery ticket that gives me one chance in  2 million of winning $1 million, I would be much more likely to salt away the $1 million than the $1, and invested safely, it would in time be worth $2 million of more. Still another thing is that winning enough to give you an income for life would give you freedom and security, which are priceless.

If you exhibit diminishing marginal utility of income, then you will not take an even payout bet, because the associated risk of losing 10 is worth more to you than the associated risk of winning 10.  It&#39;s interesting because if we marginally increase the amount of money won and hold the value of money lost constant, like this video, the point where someone actually decides to take the bet demonstrates the degree of relative risk aversion. Another way this question could be phrased is if you have a lottery with 2 outcomes both with even probability, with one outcome being $0 and one outcome $10, how much money would people be willing to take as a substitute for the bet. (risk-averse people should want some number between $0 and $5, risk neutral would want $5, and risk-loving would want more than $5.) Btw, the people in this video are insanely risk-averse.

If a random person was randomly challenged for a bet, i think he won&#39;t have much thought about the math and probability of that bet to be able to make a decision whether to take it or not. But rather, he would first make his decision by the level of trust between him and the challenger (who is a stranger). Therefore, giving him the responsibility of actually executing the game or controlling it (although it&#39;s still 50/50 chance of winning and losing) will actually make him decide to take the risk easier.", "comment_date": "2015-11-17T04:17:58Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Richard Ding", "comment_text": "law of large numbers...", "comment_date": "2015-11-17T03:13:06Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Leo Chang", "comment_text": "Sad I tot this video would be about statistics and distributions in real life", "comment_date": "2015-11-16T14:44:31Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Christian Huang", "comment_text": "CHATSWOOD CONCOURSE!!!!", "comment_date": "2015-11-16T07:10:52Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Matthis Tauritz Bakker", "comment_text": "I am 13 so... kind of crazy I might have done it with only the ten bucks", "comment_date": "2015-11-16T06:09:03Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Brian Martin", "comment_text": "Gamblers don&#39;t remember their loses.", "comment_date": "2015-11-16T02:22:29Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "ZFlyingVLover", "comment_text": "Jesus that girl is stupid", "comment_date": "2015-11-16T00:05:47Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "KiDZ", "comment_text": "What microphone does he use?", "comment_date": "2015-11-15T22:29:13Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "GarketMardener", "comment_text": "Veritasium 42.0<br>blaze it", "comment_date": "2015-11-15T21:47:10Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "James Price", "comment_text": "<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vBX-KulgJ1o&amp;t=3m08s\">3:08</a> Yellow Car", "comment_date": "2015-11-15T15:15:02Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Black Moon", "comment_text": "Yes", "comment_date": "2015-11-15T04:22:32Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Aiden Lavallee", "comment_text": "yes... although I don have 10 dollars", "comment_date": "2015-11-14T21:06:59Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Moses Mora", "comment_text": "$100,000,000", "comment_date": "2015-11-14T16:53:32Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "dan g", "comment_text": "I would have bet you the ten. ...but since you came at me with the bet I would had said under my rules ....my rules would have been heads I win tails you loose", "comment_date": "2015-11-14T16:38:00Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Aaron Lewis", "comment_text": "50", "comment_date": "2015-11-14T14:20:21Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "NoVertAce", "comment_text": "I would need 1 dollar", "comment_date": "2015-11-14T00:23:09Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Khristian Holdcroft", "comment_text": "10 dollars I would have done it for fun", "comment_date": "2015-11-13T22:39:20Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Kaleb Bruwer", "comment_text": "Anyone that even knows how fractions work and has at least $20, will take that bet if you can repeat it.", "comment_date": "2015-11-13T17:08:06Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Maria Coelho", "comment_text": "Yes, 10$", "comment_date": "2015-11-13T16:19:26Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Brian Frangos", "comment_text": "I would take it at like $15... maybe even at the beginning.

If they win the bet they have $10,010 ($10/$10,010 is ~.1% increase) and if they lose they have $9,990 ($10/$9,990 is ~.1% decrease). The larger the participants wallet, the less risk they face when gambling. In this scenario, there&#39;s still no reason for the participant to bet since the gain doesn&#39;t outweigh the loss, it just equals it. (Roughly, the loss is still slightly higher than the gain, but the difference is negligible.)<br><br>As another example, let&#39;s say the participant had $100 and gained $15 when they win and lose $10 when they lose. If they win they have $115 ($15/$115 is ~13% increase) and if they lose they have $90 ($10/$90 is an ~11% decrease). At this point the potential benefit /should/ outweigh the potential risk, and this is where your video kicks in with the psychology of not wanting to risk it.

Taking away someone&#39;s cash adds an element of liquidity risk - there is a risk that they will need that cash to pay for an essential bill in the future and by being unable to pay this bill there may be far bigger impacts than the $10 loss.

It implies that you subjectively just don&#39;t feel like taking a bet even though you\u00a0should.\u00a0As he points out\u00a0toward the end,\u00a0you can think of every bet as\u00a0one in a series throughout your life, and\u00a0in those actual terms, you do\u00a0stand to gain absolutely. To avoid that would be irrational.<br><br>But\u00a0that doesn&#39;t apply to all bets equally. Some bets\u00a0involve much higher stakes,\u00a0so that just one\u00a0bet equals a great number of your smaller bets that you may be used to taking, by the philosophy presented in this video. Those bets really are one-offs, because\u00a0it has one chance to\u00a0go right or wrong and cause a huge swing in your overall losses.\u00a0The fear of this is not irrational loss aversion. It is something else.<br><br>It&#39;s a\u00a0rational fear of uncertainty. If for example, you were risking your life. Then it is all or nothing. Every bet you&#39;ve won up to that point can be cancelled out in one shot. Then it&#39;s back to the original scenario, without its implied context: one isolated bet, with a 50% chance of winning or losing, and no other bets matter. Even if you were just risking your bank account, 20 years of savings, it might not kill you, but you may never make it up either.<br><br>In that case, it isn&#39;t irrational loss aversion that you&#39;re expressing by declining the bet. It&#39;s just a fear of leaving your winnings up to chance. Why would you do that, objectively speaking, why would you put all of your life&#39;s accumulated winnings on the line for a literal coin flip, when you can\u00a0continue your longer series of bets which, due to repetition, will almost certainly average out to provide you with steady gains? Any poker player knows that if you go risking your entire bankroll on one hand, you are a sure loser. But if you take those 55% shots to win again and again, risking a measured amount each time so that you can always afford to repeat it, that&#39;s how you properly pursue the earnings predicted by the statistics.\u00a0Large uncertainty is undesirable, and it is unnecessary but ONLY if you&#39;re mindful of the fact that the more you bet at once, the less often you can repeat it.", "comment_date": "2015-07-19T07:29:39Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Michael M-D", "comment_text": "Wow this is in concourse chatswood", "comment_date": "2015-07-19T05:34:33Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Nautilus Guitars", "comment_text": "This video is a good representation of praxeology.", "comment_date": "2015-07-19T02:42:45Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "michaelanthony151", "comment_text": "I disagree with this video - I would not take the bet unless it was very favorable because I have a high enough opinion of myself that I believe that my ability to make money is better than this one time 50% chance. taking the total aggregate of my life this bet is a bad decision. on the other hand if i had a really low opinion of myself i would take the bet much sooner, perhaps only when its slightly favorable.

Why would I want to take your hard earned money. You need it as much as i do. The harm caused to you might be small, but it exist. The \u00a0gain I would receive would would be so small, that it would not be worth the minor harm it would cause you. I know you believe that a minor harm to you would not effect others, but it does. The same is true when harm comes to others, it cause harm to you, regardless how small. Imagine if when I won the ten dollars from you, you also died. Would you make the bet? Do you think the question is foolish? Every day I make hundreds of choices, and each one could cause harm to me, no matter how small the chance, they exist. Funny thing is, these low probabilities add up. Let say we take a chance that help us both, but we work together. If we fail, darn, if we succeed great. We could both suffer, but not at the cost of the other. Look, when sea birds nest on a island, they go out to sea to catch fish to feed their young, Some seabirds don&#39;t do this, instead they rob the nest of their neighbors. Stealing has much less risk when compared to go out to sea. Why don&#39;t all sea \u00a0birds do this? Well, some birds do do this, and they individually do better, but at a cost to the whole colony. This type of behavior can only exist at most, twenty percent before the colony fails. There is this cool equations to show how this works. This is why you can find different species nesting together on one island. This is why gambling is illegal in sane societies. We can work, and take risk that helps us all, are we can benefit at the cost of others, and have society fail. \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0", "comment_date": "2015-02-12T21:53:56Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Cullen Mills", "comment_text": "I would take the best at a ratio of 1:1.", "comment_date": "2015-02-12T21:40:55Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Recnid", "comment_text": "If you put 40 bucks i would take the bet :)", "comment_date": "2015-02-12T20:19:19Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Daymein Vines", "comment_text": "Learning things from you, numberphile, and VSauce, brings me so much joy.

Add to that that your personal economy is probably budgeted on the money you DO have, a loss would mean cutting back on something potentially very valuable (need to have), whereas a win would only mean a little something extra (nice to have). The logical thing is always to demand higher pay-offs for higher risks.<br>The illogicals of loss aversion are tied to the endowment effect, and there is a neurological basis for this. This is something that has been incorporated into &quot;Prospect theory&quot;, which you should really check out if you liked this video.

Simultaneously, the brain might automatically and subconsciously categorize you (interviewer) as a non-trustworthy person that only gives him or her (interviewee) bad deals even though there is no sufficient data for this conclusion. The result of this test might be different if you started with another number.

Poker is a bit more complicated because there&#39;s imperfect information. So I might know that I have the best hand right now. But I have to make assumptions about your hand. Whereas with the coin flip, I know exactly what your side is and my side is and exactly what the odds are that I&#39;m going to win. But, ultimately a lot of decisions come down to calculating odds and asking what exactly the expected value is.<br><br>In my experience, poker players (for the most part) don&#39;t suffer from loss aversion. In fact, frequently they will call incredibly bad odds offered them. For example, if I have the best hand right now and I think you&#39;re on a flush draw (a hand that beats me), I should bet about half of the pot. That means a call costs you 3:1 (or about 25%). The odds of hitting a flush are about 4:1 (or 20%). So you shouldn&#39;t make this call. Because you&#39;re going to lose your bet 4 times to every 1 time you win. But when you win, you&#39;re only going to win 3x your cost. Over time this is a losing call. Over time, this kind of call has a negative expected value.<br><br>But a lot of poker players don&#39;t do this. You can offer them 2:1 or 1:1 odds and they&#39;ll often still call. This suggests that there are a lot more bad and inexperienced poker players than there are good ones. But it also suggests that loss aversion is not universal.<br><br>(It&#39;s actually quite a bit more complicated than that. Especially in tournament play, where neither winning or losing the hand causes you to win any money.

Perhaps it is due to the fact that some losses have the potential of bringing the game to an end - effectively stopping our ongoing series of bets. The loss of life is the most obvious example.

At each toss, you have a 50-50 chance of winning or losing $1. You can go on playing as long as you like - we assume your opponent will always have more money to lose to you. If you actually do go on and on playing this game, you are certain to lose all your money - even if you were a billionnaire to begin with. This problem is known as the Gambler&#39;s Ruin.<br><br>Even if we tip the scales in your favor (like what you did by offering unbalanced bets, or by using a coin that favors one outcome), you can still run a significant risk of losing everything.<br><br>To give a numerical example, let&#39;s assume you win if it&#39;s heads - and there is a 55% chance of that happening on any toss. Since you bet $1, your expected return on the bet is $0.10. If you have $3 to begin with, and you play on and on and on, the probability that you will end up with nothing is about 55%.<br><br>The greater the odds are in your favor, and the more money you have to begin with, the less your probability of being ruined is.<br>\u00a0<br>It&#39;s good to fail fast and fail often (like Google says) - but be careful not to fail fatally. One should make bets rationally - but the roots of loss aversion also make sense (thanks evolution!).<br><br>Be that as it may, I can clearly see how risk aversion can easily get out of hand and be extremely detrimental to our quality of life.

It&#39;s very rational. If you play 100 bets, then you need to have money to bet on 100 bets. Then each bet you lose just 1% of what you currently have to bet. You can take the risk since it&#39;s insignificant. It&#39;s the same way at casinos, where people gamble in small portions all their money away.<br><br>In life you get presented with opportunities to either win a lot, or lose most things you depend on. This is the reason why most people don&#39;t take risks in life. Those that do, either end up miserable or very successful. I mean, looking at the success story of Bill Gates for example, I couldn&#39;t name one person who would go through what he has done to kick-start his business.<br><br>Now, the most important part of this video: why do people refuse the first bet with 10$? Why is the slap more memorable? Because you don&#39;t look at those 10$, but look at the total amount that person has. Say for example the woman in the dress has 40$ on her, for various reasons, to get around and stuff. She feels safe with 40$. Now, she can lose 10$ and get left with 30$. There is a 50% chance of that. What that will mean to her? She might not have enough cash to eat at her favorite place. That&#39;s a very high cost. What she gets to win? She has a 50% chance to end up with 50$. But she only needs 40$ today. The extra 10$ will be spent on stuff she doesn&#39;t really need, or she will end up going home with that extra 10$, not enjoying the value of it.<br>So, 50% chance to have the day spoiled, and 50% chance to have a piece of paper/plastic in the pocket. So it&#39;s obvious why she didn&#39;t take the bet.<br><br>This is called marginal utility. For every dollar she loses, the marginal utility of her money goes up a lot.

We begin with a pot with zero dollar in it. I will first flip a coin. If it is tail, then the game terminates. You are now on your own, penniless. Otherwise, I will put 2 dollars in the pot, and then I will flip the coin again. If it is tail, then again the game terminates and you get the money in the pot, otherwise I will put 2^2 dollars in the pot and the game continues.<br>In general, on the n&#39;th round, I will flip a coin. If the coin is tail up, you take whatever there is in the pot and leave. Otherwise, I put 2^n dollars into the put and we advance to the n+1&#39;th round.<br><br>What is the expected value of the money gained from this game?<br>It can be easily shown that the expected value is -(a fraction of your finite saving) +\u00a0(1/2^2)(2) + (1/2)(2^2) + ... + (1/2^n)(2^n) + ... = -(a fraction of your finite saving) + 1 + 1 + .... = infinity.<br>Therefore, if we are to fully accept the use of expected value, then no matter how much money we have, the &quot;logical&quot; choice is to give up our lifelong saving to play the game. But intuitively speaking, this should not be the case. I doubt many people (barring the extremely poor) would participate in a game like this.<br><br>The solution to this paradox, I believe, lies in the use of utility.

An example I have come across is many salespeople are given prepaid commission (vs that of commission given out per sale), that is if the salesperson is unable to make the amount of sales to meet their prepaid commission amount, they must give money back. The effect of loss aversion kicks in here, and there suddenly is such a higher degree of motivation for the salesperson to sell more products, as they do not want to lose the money given to them (Money that they now &quot;own&quot;).

So I&#39;m the type to be interested in this sort of risk analysis type thing :) I liked seeing the general public polled, seeing their perspective on the issue. But I also really, really liked how you tried to make the concept more intuitive. Because some people will just do the math and say &quot;this bet favors you so take it stupid&quot; and just be done with it.<br><br>Indeed I think there is something about consistency that us humans tend to like -- I know I do. Something about the comfort of a &quot;true guarantee&quot; that is appealing. Maybe we think we just aren&#39;t really in touch with the idea of a &quot;50 percent chance of winning x money&quot; because it seems so transient, non-tangible. So I like how you then presented the further example where instead of taking one bet, you take 10, 100, etc. It sort of helps a person see the big picture; it helps them see the power of having good odds. And that power can be represented in any amount of trials, even one. Sure the one trial might result in an outright loss, but it carries the same sort of power. That chance of you having that outright loss is a part of a big opportunity to win. You sum it up excellently: we need to find a way, in general, to look at the one trial as if it&#39;s a part of many trials, and base our decisions like that.<br><br>As for the bets I would take; it depends a little. Just because there are a few more possible variables here. It might be that having $0 in some situation is just really bad. Maybe you&#39;re a little kid and that&#39;s all the money you got for a theme park or something. So betting 10 to win 12, well, to get more money in the long run it&#39;s a good idea, even if it&#39;s a single bet, but since the money means a lot at this particular time, maybe it&#39;s a big priority to have at least 10 dollars, that you&#39;re willing to accept a betting decision with a lower overall value, i.e., not betting. Of course, if this kid had $50 available or something, then he or she should just take the bet, since either way he or she will have more than enough money for the theme park and has a favorable opportunity to win more money overall.", "comment_date": "2015-01-06T06:17:54Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Gabriel Pendragon", "comment_text": "Life is a series of risk VS reward calculations.

What is the chance their next flip will be heads?<br>Simple, it is a 50/50 chance their next flip will be heads. While it is true that the chance of flipping 10 heads in a row is very small, but if they already flipped 9 heads in a row, it is simply a 50/50 chance.<br>And this applies to anything that works like a fair coin, always giving the same probability of success.<br>If someone is on a win-streak of 99 bets, the chance that they will win their 100th bet is the same as their chance to win their 1st bet.

As you play the bet more and more times, your average profit per bet converges towards the expected profit ($5 at the $30 vs $10 rate) and the variance goes to 0. At the limit, there is no risk left in the bet.<br><br>It&#39;s not that losses are bad per se, but that resources are usually more valuable when a loss occurs (starving during lunch) than when a gain is realized (you now have 2 burgers).<br><br>A good example for contrast is the market for insurances. When people buy insurances, they essentially make a bet where they LOSE money on average.
