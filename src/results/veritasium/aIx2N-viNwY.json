This is what gets me:  I remember in high school thinking man this is going so slow, I have 4 more years until I graduate?! 6 years have passed since 2016! Thats high school and a half all over again, insane! \r<br>\r<br>In 2016 graduated, went to university right after, dropped down to community due to bombing my SAT/ACT and having to take beginner courses drove me insane, not having a single course related to my major...Those couple years or so at Uni felt somewhat fast but not like what I feel these days. I was underperforming but still experiencing new things. \r<br>\r<br>At community everything was going fine, now this was a bit faster than what high school time was like though. Then boom covid, everything online. Learned almost nothing in class and lost contact with meeting new people. That is when time started blowing by for me personally.  I would believe it if it was still 2020... <br><br>I guess what this means is not actively experiencing new things makes my life more repetitive which makes time speed up. I do not play video games for a fraction as much as I used to but the overall years are somehow faster! Back then even though I spent so much time playing games I was still doing different things, going to friends houses, talking to more people, experiencing the world a bit more. That is all it took to offset 40+ hours of video games a week.

When we are a kid, everything is new as you said - and therefore we have a tremendous amount of information getting in our brain each day making them feel longer.

We know the wall is a wall so our attention is not directed onto that. Same goes for actions and basically everything - we automatise things, driving - routines - dressing - so much things we don&#39;t need to focus on anymore.<br>This is then amplified by other things - we spend more time in our thoughts, because we now have concerns, complex thoughts, memories etc. And time spent in one&#39;s own mind makes the time feel very very fast, it&#39;s an abstraction from the present moment. Same goes for the flow thing you described, focusing a lot and giving it all for something means making abstraction of everything else around to purely focus on one thing, which means abstraction from the present moment again, and times feels faster. And with the high tech and connected society, it&#39;s even increased since time spent in front lf screens create this effect. Therefore, as adults, we are constantly in some sort of abstraction, be it automatisms, focus or thoughts, and that&#39;s why time feels quicker.", "comment_date": "2022-08-12T22:24:19Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Hi", "comment_text": "Jesus loves you\ud83d\ude0a", "comment_date": "2022-08-12T21:09:25Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "bv s", "comment_text": "Last day in school, (Friday for me) and school days are faster in fourth grade than third grade", "comment_date": "2022-08-12T17:03:12Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Roblox mostly or only", "comment_text": "lets all agree this made us all want to stay kid", "comment_date": "2022-08-12T15:24:57Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "ImJustGarbage", "comment_text": "I\u2019m only 13 but I remember a time when I was about 6 years old and I had to wait 4 hours for my friends to show up and it felt like an entire day.

I am pretty sure a lot of you have experienced the &quot;how did i got here so fast&quot;. Another example: When you are leaving the house and you are wondering if you have locked the door. You had been in a routine again. When you are playing games, sports -&gt; muscle memories: these are all routines. During your days you are doing most likely everyday quite similiar things so your brain will enforce routines to simplefy the data processing. So how to escape the circle of routines?

We start taking many things for granted as well, and (especially in our 20s and 30s) have a focused mindset on &quot;success&quot;, and lose our sense of what&#39;s going on around us. As such, we become so focused on our future (as well as our past regrets), that we fail to live &quot;in the moment&quot;.

Two groups are based on the continued experience of novel events.

We\u2019re speaking of the perception of time which is malleable and conditional. If we possessed no ability to remember it seems reasonable to conclude that we\u2019d have no sense of time passing (hence no time).  Our ability to remember is better when we are younger, additionally events we are witnessing for the first time need to be recorded in our brains. We expend energy and focus as we make those new memories making us more in the moment. That \u201cmarks\u201d time making it more memorable.  By the time we\u2019re adults we\u2019ve imprinted many more experiences.  So what role does memory, (or do memories that need to be remembered) play in our perception of time?  After all, we need memory to measure our perception of time.  <br>Experiment- let\u2019s test the effect of memories on perception of time.  Let\u2019s imagine our memories are physical matter, say sand.  If we pour sand into a bag  the more sand stays in the bag, the more the bag will weigh. But if the bag develops holes, less sand is retained, it will weigh less.  Just as the duration of a year seems shorter when so many memories are lost, or so many experiences are no longer as note worthy, hence less memorable, that effects our perception of time. In reality the amount of sand poured never changed, what was retained changed given the impression of less volume.  So one is left with the impression that less sand was poured since much of what should be weighed was lost through the holes.  Just like the amount of time in a year doesn\u2019t change, but it seems to as we lose memories into the ether.

As an adult you understand better that you have a lot less free time. You have to work, there are obligational chunks of time used, say for house chores or maybe getting your car serviced, even just going to work.<br><br>When you are younger you don&#39;t have to worry so much about not having time to do something you want to do, because you have a lot less obligational time. But as you grow older you get more obligational time in your day, and it seems to grow continually as you age. First, it&#39;s due to maturing and the need to satisfy your responsibilities, and then as you reach retirement it&#39;s the knowledge that you don&#39;t have a lot of time left. As you start to face death, either by losing those close to you or just reaching the point where you have so much you want to do and have never done, your conscious mind starts to understand that every minute you have left is numbered. And you start to feel that you are running out of time. Once you begin to understand that everyone does die, you now see time in a bottle, it&#39;s limited. It&#39;s not just a tap you can turn on like you did as a kid, you know eventually the bottle will run out. You start to appreciate time more, you value it far as you age, this leads to time seemingly being so short.<br><br>That aging makes you feel like you&#39;ve missed a lot of time in your life over the mundane, because of all the obligatory time you have had. Vacations are faster, days off blow by, because despite the fact that you have free time now, compared to the obligatory time you have, it&#39;s a much smaller amount.<br><br>An older person who has memory issues, enjoys a slower passing of time. They don&#39;t remember the obligatory time they have had, they don&#39;t remember the time they have &quot;wasted&quot; in their lives, so to them, it&#39;s much like a small child again. This helps to prove that the passage of time is a subconscious view of the time used in your life. When your brain can&#39;t or won&#39;t process in the moment the amount of time you have used, compared to the knowledge that it will run out, time slows down for you. But once you realize more and more that you just don&#39;t have enough time in your day, you&#39;re perception of time seems to speed up.", "comment_date": "2022-05-22T04:16:16Z", "likes_count": 821}, {"comment_by": "Deerheart Studio Arts", "comment_text": "When I\u2019m doing my art, time passes faster than I expected it to.", "comment_date": "2022-05-22T04:15:09Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Robert Black", "comment_text": "It\u2019s the opposite for me", "comment_date": "2022-05-22T04:07:42Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Pixel Puppy", "comment_text": "The pandemic is a great case study of our perception of time: during the two years of isolation, every day felt like it went on forever.

It\u2019s not real. Just something humans came up with. If anyone wants to get real answers. Become a quantum physicist. Or at lest study it. As a hypnotherapist I can say the human perception of time is very skewed. I can also say that this video provides little valuable information. It\u2019s extremely surface level. Which many humans need as many cannot handle the complexities of the universe. Even the scientists have realized that the frequency vibration of earth has been speeding up. Some call it The Schumann resonance.  Earths inhabitants will also raise their internal vibration as a result. However not all have chosen to do so just yet. Past present and future is all happening now. Again. The human brain cannot conceive how they can be watching this video at the same time they are being born. But this is very much the case. <br>    There\u2019s some truths to what is discussed in this video. Based on human perception/deception and that not everyone can process or handle quantum principles as even the most seasoned practitioners can have they mind bent like a pretzel during a session when speaking with high dimensional beings from all over the universe and their explanations of things. <br>   For me what I enjoy most about what I do is when I have an every day average person who has no knowledge of such complex things come out of a session with their mind blown after connecting with extremely intelligent beings talking through the client about principles and concepts they have never ever heard or have been taught. It\u2019s usually life changing for the better. Every now and again there\u2019s one that goes into denial and goes back to their normal perception of life. Which sometimes is for the better. <br>     Everyone can be hypnotized. Unless they are capable of going their entire life without sleeping. To clarify, when we induce the client we bring the client into theta. The 3rd or 4 levels of trance (brain wave activity). Beta is wide awake, alpha is light trance (watch tv more than a min and your in alpha, or sometimes while driving on the highway) then theta (dream state) and delta (no activity, sound asleep) it\u2019s like putting a baby to sleep but instead of letting them fall completely asleep we are able to hold them in theta and remove the conscious part of the mind yet still communicate with them. <br>      We don\u2019t tell the client where to go what to see or anything. The clients higher self takes care of all that. Which we speak with. Which is our true self. Miraculous things happen in these sessions. We are also able to communicate with an intelligence that is far far superior to any conscious human. <br>    Although no amount of information is sufficient for a true skeptic however anyone can practice self hypnosis and have out of body experiences, lucid dreaming etc. Plenty of guided self hypnosis meditations on YouTube. <br>    I encourage everyone to seek answers for themselves and not take my word for it. I\u2019m more of a guide than a messenger. <br>     But since we are creators and beliefs create reality, one experiences what they expect based on their beliefs and perception.

Do you remember every particular day at your job? Every particular morning meeting? No. All the hundreds of meetings unite into one general situation in your memory. If your every day was somehow special, for example being every day on a new different place, you would remember every day and the year would seem really long to you. I remember, when I was going to high school, the years were very short. After high school, during one year I was moving from one job to another job, it was horrible, I was working for around 10 companies during one year, but that year was sooooo long. That year seemed to me like several years. Just because I was changing my life every few weeks, all the time I was experiencing something new. Now, many years later, I have a stable job, doing the same stuff every day, and the time runs so quickly, because all I do is sitting in front of computer and nothing else, and when I try to remember what happened during the last year, I see just one picture, one memory - me, sitting behind the desk.

When time is observed - it slows down! Little kids, when they go to school, they often \u2018count\u2019 hours or minutes, they have many timetables, rosters, they have to live by. So they constantly observe time. Every hour they have different lesson, every lesson lasts 45 minutes, breaks are much shorter.

It\u2019s more like novelty rather than anything else. for instance. I\u2019m married and hav one child.  As I write this, I know what I\u2019m going to do when I go home, I know what\u2019s hampering tomorrow etc. Just left the gym, going home  from an overnight shift, take a shower, relax, eat dinner go to sleep. get up the next day, work (I work 7 days!! \ud83d\ude31\ud83d\ude31\ud83d\ude31) daughter goes to school, wife works, come home eat dinner , take my daughter to taekwando, then piano, then eat sleep repeat all through the weekend!!! Since January,  all I see is Mondays, Fridays and Sundays!! Nothing changes every week. So your brain shuts it out and you\u2019re<br>literally on auto pilot! When I was in my 20s and living with my parents, all I did was work Monday - Friday,  and go out in weekends as a single guy, hoping for what girl I could meet etc, and 95 percent of the time, nothing happened but the weeks lasted longer!! It was the uncertainty of what I was going to do, club, meet a girl, play pool with the boys etc, that made it last!! Now I literally know what\u2019s happening every day hence why it does so quickly!! Here 3 hours goes by and feels like half hour!! When I was over seas and got married in a church, the week I was there with my best man and my sister, I was stunned when I was sitting one day outside with them and thought 3 hours passed and literally half hour passed by! we had nothing ti do but drink coffee and talk in the Phillipines  while we were getting the wedding preparation under way!! every day is a saturday like they say and boy was it true. So in my opinion, it\u2019s novelty vs familiarity thy makes \u201ctime go by quickly\u201d<br>I always say good morning when I go to work on monday, and my coworker says, it\u2019s monday we can do this, and I say\u201d yes and tomorrow will be Friday\u201d just like now it\u2019s almost june and I should be excited about summer and I said to my wife just the other day\u201d it will be Christmas soon!!

The uniqueness of the experience<br>2. The emotional impact of the experience. <br>So to expand on that a little.. our minds are efficiency evolved... Always finding ways to create shortcuts and measure importance... Essentially both 1 and 2 are a lot more intertwined than you realise.. as emotions are impacted more by &quot;new&quot; than they are something they&#39;ve already experienced before.... Let me provide an example.  <br>You&#39;re driving down a road you&#39;ve never driven down before.. the road is 20 miles and takes about 30-40 minutes.  <br>You take in the road as you&#39;re driving as well as the green rolling pastures on either side of the road.<br>About half way along your trip there is a stunning lake that expands off in to horizon, the sun is just in the right spot in the evening to reflect off the water greeting a dazzling display.<br>Your favorite song is playing on the radio as you pass the lake.. reminding you of a special time with a loved one... The whole experience is impactful so much you can&#39;t help tear up for a moment.<br>Now this will impact in your hippocampus.. particularly strengthened by emotional association as well as a &quot;new experience&quot;. <br>See there&#39;s more here... This is the first time you&#39;ve ever driven along this road sure... But you&#39;re driving to a new job at a gas station in the next town over.. it&#39;s a night shift job hence why you&#39;re driving their in the evening... And this is your first shift.<br>You get to work and think to yourself that was a nice drive and all but it certainly felt like a solid 40+ minutes.. really you think to yourself it felt like an hour .. <br>You work your job through the night... And drive home in the morning for a sleep most the day.<br>Your brain works away that night banking the new memories.. it takes particular care of the memory of the lake.... Because it&#39;s important, hence the emotional response.<br>You get up in the evening and drive to work again.<br>This time the drive feels less interesting... And two things happen...<br>A. Your mind uses almost what you&#39;d call a de-duplication process inline with your senses... That is.. the things it&#39;s seen before, it pays &quot;less&quot; attention to.<br>Sort of like saying... &quot;I&#39;ve already seen that I don&#39;t need to process it&quot;<br>And B. you&#39;re less excited.. in fact you&#39;re not really looking forward to work as it&#39;s a mundane job .. so your brain is less stimulated and thus doesn&#39;t process things in as much detail... Which makes time pass perceptibly faster...<br>The combination of both the fact you&#39;ve already done this activity before as well as the fact you&#39;re less excited both work together to make the time pass faster.. or more so... The memories of that time as less detailed so the whole experience passes faster.<br>This applies to the rest of our lives.. with the things we&#39;ve done before having less attention applies and making less an impact emotionally to our memories thus passing quicker .. and quicker and quicker . <br>On top of those things there is also the ratio of time lived over time left.  .your first 10 years is 100% OF your life so far.. but the next 10 are now only 50% of your life so far...<br>When you&#39;re 40.. the next 10 years are now only 25% of your life lived so far... <br>All of these things combine together to make life speed up expedentially...<br>Which really sucks :(", "comment_date": "2022-05-10T06:40:51Z", "likes_count": 12}, {"comment_by": "ItzLostPlayz", "comment_text": "My gaming PC is so old each time i play it it goes so fast.", "comment_date": "2022-05-10T06:23:32Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Danijel Blair", "comment_text": "Timed myself on my phones stopwatch eyes closed, 59.74 seconds! 18yrs", "comment_date": "2022-05-10T00:19:10Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Cool Bro", "comment_text": "My time is the same.

Therefore the original question did not get answered properly in my opinion. My hypothesis is that the overall experienced time is dependent on the amount of significant events in life. Simply increase the amount of significant event and you will notice, the weeks, months and years will be going much slower again.

First off, we have to dispense with the illusion that our time is the same as t  in physics.  It&#39;s not.  Our time, or our perception of time, is based on the second law of thermodynamics.  We feel time moving &quot;forward&quot; because of entropy.  Now that we&#39;ve established that, I will go on to support my original argument.  Since our measure of time is completely relative to how long we have been measuring it, then as we get older the percentage of our life a year takes becomes smaller.  When you are one year old then one year represents 100% of your life.  That&#39;s all of your memories, so when another year passes it feels like you just lived another lifetime.  As you get older and your collective memories grow, that passage represents less and less a percentage of your life.  A year of memories and experiences at 70 years represents 1/70th of your collective memories, so you feel it pass at a pace that is proportional to the inverse of that percentage.

Perception of time is very closely tied to self-awareness as a function of the stimulus feedback loop that creates consciousness.  There&#39;s a reason why adults don&#39;t remember much before the age of 5/6 and why they remember virtually nothing from their toddler years.  It&#39;s because the mechanisms for correlating the passage of time to distinct and descrete memories aren&#39;t fully formed yet, and necessarily so in order for the relative measure of the passage of time to not be unbearably slow for a conscious, self-aware being.  We&#39;re not fully aware of each moment when we are small children, and only pockets of consciousness are present.  Continuous consiousness and self-awareness manifest later on, when each moment can be experienced as a small enough fraction of the overall amount of time we&#39;ve already lived.  Time seems to pass faster as we age because our only metric of how fast time is passing is based on time&#39;s passing being inextricably and exclusively relative only to itself, regardless of how many devices or methods we use to objectively track it.  An isolated minute may feel just as long in the moment at 65 as it did at 15 when actively and consciously aware, but relative to how many minutes have already passed, when being traversed passively, they move at two very different tempos when placed in the context of comparitive duration to overall duration at each point in time.", "comment_date": "2021-12-24T18:45:44Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "FullSizedGaming", "comment_text": "This is flipped backwards.

And axons are surrounded by a &quot;Jacket&quot; of fatty acids mixed with proteins and glycosides known as Schwann cells.  And abnormal thinning of the Schwann jacket thickness or a hole in it can adversely slow down the travel of neural impulse currents just like stripping the coating from the copper wire within adversely effects electrical current traveling via the wire.   We do know that as we age, we lose brain neuron cells and the Schwann cell jackets do thin out leading to &quot;age related&quot; slower neural conduction.

In that case I felt they all equally appeared/disappeared on the screen in terms of time duration or more accurately the blinking car  at the beginning still appeared to be lasting bit longer before it disappeared.

It&#39;s like it gives me some metric to anchor/ground myself with and I can speed the time instead of just floating in a sort of limbo.  This made any time I was told to sit still for 5 minutes go faster, short car trips, etc.  Anything I could count my way through without getting bored or losing count.<br><br>My feelings, as a person a bit shy of 4 decades, is that it&#39;s &quot;all of the above&quot;.  Any given amount of time is a smaller percentage of my whole then when I was 1/5th this age.  But also, I suspect the brain slows down with age such that the temporal distance between &quot;ticks&quot; of my clock are greater.  We measure time as the &quot;temporal distance&quot; between two &quot;events&quot;, so it stands to reason that our internal clock has ticks/CPU cycles.  If we have fewer cycles, we pick up less information.  It&#39;s like taking a picture every second vs taking a picture every 5 seconds and then looking at them together after 2 minutes of doing so.  In the first case, you have 120 pictures while in the second, you have 24.  So in the second case, you catch more data, and perceive less &quot;time&quot; having passed.<br><br>But then there&#39;s also repetition, where things you do often become routine and seem to take less time.  But this is probably ACTUALLY the brain focus argument, as things you repeat a lot you require less brainpower and focus to complete.  So in this way, repetition is more &quot;how easily can you &#39;autopilot&#39; the task?&quot;, which is a brain focus/activity/energy argument.<br><br>Finally, there&#39;s the brain state, such as scared, excited/adrenaline pumping, and/or bored, each of which ALSO chemically alter our brain CPU speed, which (going back to that argument above), means a greater awareness of time since the greater speed your brain is processing, the more instants of time you record (again, the picture every second vs picture every 5 seconds discussion).  Obviously that plays a role as well.  Though ARGUABLY this could mean that the brain state is just an extension of the CPU argument...<br><br>Taken together, I think this explains, on the whole, what&#39;s going on and how our perception of time changes.  Though I think one CAN choose to focus on the moment while they&#39;re living in it, extending enjoyable experiences.  That takes a lot of mental discipline and may diminish enjoyment, though, depending on the person.  So it&#39;s not always a choice between having a long perceived life or a short but enjoyable one.

Life is a sensory exploration experience and we are highly geared to seeking out new experiences which we process in two main ways, the purely emotional non executive sensory flow, and the executive managed selective flow (reading a book, having a conversation, etc). Both of these have different time perceptions, but compounding this is that as we age our brain cycle rate slows down making time seem to pass more quickly. Also as we age the brain transitions from all grey matter to more white matter (connections). I suspect that the brain doesn\u2019t track activity performed by white matter (automatic subconscious) in the same way so have a different time perception. <br>Smaller brains cycle faster and react to sensory information much faster.

So people can see the world at around 60 fps. However, flies can see the world at 250 fps. But what exactly does this look like to the fly? Does the fly just process everything at bizarrely dizzying speeds in its perspective? No, cause then that information wouldn&#39;t make any sense to the fly. I think the fly would rather see the world as if time went slower by about 1/4th the speed of how people see the world. Cause then, the fly would be able to process the world more easily.<br><br>When time &quot;speeds up&quot; and &quot;slows down&quot; in our perception of the world, it would be our internal fps changing. That&#39;s because our perception of time is no longer frames per second, but rather seconds per frame. So lower fps would increase the time it takes to perceive a frame and higher fps would decrease the time it takes to perceive a frame. When we are excited, our time perception shortens as a result of raising fps. When we stagnate, our time perception lengthens as a result of lowering fps.<br><br>To explain why retrospective thought on exciting moments seems longer, that&#39;s because the result of having higher fps means having more frames in memory. Since we would perceive our memories at similar rates for different memories the one with more frames seems longer. Whereas for long lectures, there are less frames of memory which is why thinking back on it seems like it went in one ear and out the other.<br><br>Though why would excitement make it seem as if time is going faster if you want to take it all in? Why would stagnation make you experience that dull time for even longer in that moment? I believe it&#39;s less about the fps at that moment and moreso resource allocation. By pushing yourself to higher fps, you are dedicating more resources to maintaining that high fps. Whereas for stagnation, you are freeing up resources to use for other things. That being said, when you are excited, your internal thoughts don&#39;t have much wiggle room while when you&#39;ve stagnated, your mind is free to wander. I believe it is that difference in mental freedom that creates the difference in time perception.<br><br>When you are excited, you place less emphasis on your inner thoughts in favor for quicker action. When you stagnate, you place more emphasis on thoughts over immediate action. The more free your thoughts are, the more time you have.

Your misuse of a graph to show that &quot;half&quot; is achieved at age 6, is flawed math to say the least. You are summing progressively diminishing PERCENTAGES of static measurements over a set of assumed values with an assumed end point. That is an absolute fail. The first graph is completely valid, showing percentage of life which 1 year represents at each completed year of life. You cannot regress the &quot;area under the curve&quot; of a set created in that fashion and have a useful result. And instead of realizing that you were misusing the technique, you decided that it negated the argument. Again, hilariously bad. The basis of each portion of experienced time to total experienced time is only part of the overall sensation. The next most significant is novelty of experience. As your life gains routine, you are not attaching any import to those repeated moments, and they &quot;vanish&quot; in memory.

I think that&#39;s the same thing as being a child and experiencing time &quot;slower&quot; than when you are older. It has to do with how much energy you put into creating the dream fantasy just like a kid gets to imagine the possibilities of what is going to happen in the upcoming episode of his favourite show or how he will use the toy to play or what is school going to be like. Due to the fact that the adult has experienced more things in life, he chooses to use his memory to associate, compare and anticipate similar situations, whereas the child with little to no experience and only its imagination to guide it will invest more energy into creating possible outcomes of a situation. So pulling a vague memory of the top of your head makes the upcoming experience more predictable and relatable in comparison to making 10 different scenarios in your head. I am no expert by any means. Sometimes i like to day dream while listening to music and i&#39;ve noticed time &quot;feels slower&quot; as in i get to create fantasies out of scratch so much faster than lets say living those scenarios in real life. It is basically an illusion where you fit more (imagined) experiences in the same period of time you would recall a past memory. So my advice to anyone who wants to slow down time, is to use your imagination more often. Even when you are going to eat at a similar restaurant to what you are used to avoid recalling the times you&#39;ve eaten from your regular restaurant and try to imagine what new things you might experience. Even if you&#39;ve seen an action movie before, try to avoid comparing the one you are about to see with it. It&#39;s hard because we&#39;ve all lost the novelty in a lot of things we do but it&#39;s never too late to dream.", "comment_date": "2021-04-15T16:01:33Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "awuuwa", "comment_text": "<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aIx2N-viNwY&amp;t=4m00s\">4:00</a> huh? none.

Using slow critical thinking, I sort of determine that the past did happen and feel like enough time went by to not blindly follow prior thought patterns and do it again from scratch. The ore recent stuff stands out more actually for me. My childhood of my first 10 years of life in fact don&#39;t stand out anymore than the rest of the stuff and maybe even less because it&#39;s longer ago. Using slow critical thinking, I feel like eons of time have passed. My present interpretation of my past is fundamentally different than what I was experiencing at the time. It&#39;s like my past is not real. By brain was doing it&#39;s own thinking and burying my past in the sand all the time with awareness of fewer details of it the longer ago it was and like it better that way. So I was surprized when others on TV said the time they were waiting to see who won the American 2020 election felt like 100 years. So I was thinking &quot;I guess their normal habits were to feel like time was flying and now it wasn&#39;t flying so that&#39;s why they said it.&quot; It&#39;s wierd hearing other people say it&#39;s flying because I don&#39;t feel that way at all. Once in the past year there was a girl who looked about 6 in a driveway with her mother and she drew a picture that had the word thank you in it. At first, I didn&#39;t notice much about it then just after I walked past, I saw and noticed that it said thank you and that it meant thank you for looking at the picture and found it interesting then told them. The mother was glad about that.

Movies with a slow story line bore me no end now and I usually fast forward.

Apart from changing my macros I also add 36 to 48 hours of fasting every two weeks to my routine. That helps to push autophagy which is the internal cell recycling.

If you feel time passes fast then it&#39;s because you&#39;re distracted or in routine or whatever you actually call it. When you are only reacting and not actively processing thoughts, this is when time just flies by because actually you just flow through whatever period of time. And this isn&#39;t directly related to age, it&#39;s related to work and stress.

So, when you are kid , you are still free to explore other mind -wave-lengths you naturaly posess, untill they have been curbed into unified and well designed wave length which you will later call your reality . Those other mind -wave - lengths explorations give you richer experience and therefor might seam longer .

Everybody around me says that time speeds up as you age, but for me, as a 29 years old woman, time passes with the same slow pace as always. I have a quite good sense of rhythm and time, also I never wanted to get back to my younger years. Especially since I grew up with abusive and mentally ill parents, and aging means healing and getting better, stronger and wiser, so I have no reason to cry for the past. On the other hand, I am deeply analytic and creative, I study new languages (my native language is Hungarian), I started to learn to play the guitar, and I love to dance. My basic perception of the world is exactly the same as when I was 3-4 years old, I just have more knowledge and experience, but I never stopped looking at things as an &quot;unformed&quot; child. I always strive for better understanding of the world, so time passes really slowly, but full of interesting things for me, so that&#39;s why it is slow in my perception. The only time I lose my sense of time, if I am sleeping or if I have much sleep deprivation (then time crawls very painfully slowly :D ).<br>So yeah, I am just astonished how I never met anybody with the same perception of time. I know very few people who kept their childhood personalities. Most adults act weirdly in my opinion, they think they are so important and mature, but in reality not. The wisest people I&#39;ve met had childlike, flexible and curious brains, and they were always open to eliminate their hindering beliefs. Most adults seem rigid to me, but I&#39;m trying to be nice with them, because I seem to be the minority in this regard, and I can not change people.", "comment_date": "2020-07-01T11:39:21Z", "likes_count": 2}, {"comment_by": "Kennita Pombar", "comment_text": "<a href=\"http://donaldtrump.live.streaning.scanning.on.com/\">DonaldTrump.live.streaning.scanning.on.com</a>", "comment_date": "2020-07-01T11:22:49Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "R P", "comment_text": "<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aIx2N-viNwY&amp;t=5m17s\">5:17</a> did you hear a girl chuckle", "comment_date": "2020-07-01T11:01:08Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Mr. Rain and Thunder - relaxing ASMR sounds", "comment_text": "<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aIx2N-viNwY&amp;t=0m40s\">0:40</a> - So pleasantly surprised that this wasn&#39;t the point of the video.", "comment_date": "2020-07-01T10:01:18Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Jevilstail", "comment_text": "I am wasting my life away", "comment_date": "2020-07-01T09:23:45Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Matias R\u00f8mer", "comment_text": "so how do we fix this?", "comment_date": "2020-07-01T09:03:50Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Meleeman", "comment_text": "i legit thought the car lasted longer but i think i messed up the directions maybe? mainly because it was on screen for a longer amount of time than the dog was, although it was shown intermittently", "comment_date": "2020-07-01T08:10:04Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Sanyukta", "comment_text": "It feels like this has reversed in quarantine.

I have my own theory of time perception. I went white-water rafting once and I recall how everything slowed down as our raft went down into a deep trough on the river. It was a very exiting experience and as the raft shot up into the crest, the white-water was frothing around me in slow motion for a few very excitable seconds. I attribute this to my brain operating in overdrive as I processed all sensory inputs in a heightened state. An overclocked brain perceives time as going by slower because it processes faster. Have you ever been in an accident where everything seems to go by in slow motion? I think time appears to go faster as we age because our brains process at a slower rate but also because it has far more memory data to consult as we experience current events in our lives and this also takes time. Younger people have fewer experiences (memories) to draw on as they experience current events.

The more milestones you have in any given time period, the SLOWER time appears to transpire.

In any typical live, people will have the greater number of milestones earlier in life, then as we age these happen with less and less frequency.

I remember waiting a week till my birthday felt like a year when I was 9 yet at 47 an entire year can fly by and it feels like 6 months. The sad part is when we&#39;re elderly and supposed to enjoy our twilight years that&#39;s when they go by the quickest. Ever try and talk to your Grandmother or great Grandmother and you feel you have to speak to them in slow motion? Because they can&#39;t process the info as fast as you deliver it. It&#39;s also why there should be an age limit to driving. That major delay in reaction time is deadly on the road. I&#39;ve seen studies with the coloration between being elderly and being deprived of sleep. In the early stages of sleep deprivation the results are almost identical to being elderly.

I think the bigger an animal is, the slower it moves and the faster the perception of time is. It works as an opposite. Take this into account: flies live for a few weeks on average. Big mammals live for half a century on average. The experience a fly perceives in 1 day is a considerable proportion of its lifespan, which takes us back to the beginning: fast animal, slow perception. By the time you start to move your hand to catch a fly, the insect will detect your movements the same way you would detect a digger trying to catch you. The fly believe it or not might even wait to see if you\u2019re decisive to catch it and then will jump and move it\u2019s wings at hundreds of revolutions per second (something inimaginable for us). As the fly sees everything slower (and it\u2019s about perception because in this dimension time runs virtually the same for all of us), it can perform everything faster. So we humans are at the top of the hill and have to wait for thousands of years to adapt and evolve, the flu viruses in our bodies can reproduce so many generations that they evolve every year to infect us again with a disease that is not the same as the one we blocked from their ancestors, but very similar.

As we get older we have more deadlines and more obligations to meet.  While we live at home we never have to worry about when the rent is due or when the car payment is due.  As we move out to college and to a career now we have more deadlines to meet for school, work, and even bills to pay with due dates.   As these responsibilities increase more and more the faster time goes.   Once you are married and have kids now the responsibility is even more because you have meetings at schools you have kids activities to attend and so forth.   So more obligations and deadlines makes time go faster.   But once we reach an age of retirement when kids are grown and moved out and no job to go to and everyday is a weekend and perhaps house and cars are paid off time starts to slow down again.  <br><br>On another interesting note, many years ago when I was about twelve years old I went on a camping trip with my dad and his friends.  On one night I was in such an uncomfortable position that I couldn\u2019t sleep well and the night seemed to last for ever.   When I got to college and medical school when I had to study and had little time to sleep I would fall asleep in an uncomfortable position and even though I may have slept for only 3-4 hours it seemed like I slept for 6-8 hours.

So it still isn&#39;t conclusive why this is, no one knows for sure (not surprising as it&#39;s a very complex matter with the brain and metaphysical notions etc). <br>But most people agree it happens, personally I think our younger brains are just much faster than our older brains and that&#39;s the basic reason. Our old brains are basically not as aware and more vague, you could even be depressing and say they are like 10% asleep or something (as you know under 100% sleep time is instant). And for very old senile person time will also seem to go extremely fast as they may as well be classified as half asleep, lol.<br><br>For myself when I was like 5-6 seemed like the time when a day seemed so packed full and so long. Around age 12-13 the day was still reasonably long, but it seemed to reduce a little. Then by your mid 20&#39;s (which I am in now), You can make a day pass like nothing at all, which is actually depressing to be honest. Though I have no qualms about reality and the degeneration of the human body, I fully accept that my brain simply is slower and less aware than it was when it was young. I am not one of these &quot;age is just a number&quot; people in denial. <br>This is the same reason a young child can master new languages easily, yet an adult brain takes decades to try to master a second language. This is because the adult brain is formed, thus new information (learning) is harder and having a young brain which is open to the magical view of the world isn&#39;t possible anymore, you are basically stuck with however your experiences shaped you and time will then keep flying faster and faster as your brain shifts closer and closer to a state of permanent death.<br><br>The silver lining is that some day in the future they will be able to manipulate chromosome division and the loss of genes and ageing, basically they will be able to maintain people at their 20-30 year old selves without ageing. Thus only accidents will result in death in that age, of course none of us right now will be alive to see this. Though future people will have brain issues though, as the brain cells unlike other body cells are not meant to die and rebuild (otherwise you would forget everything you ever knew quickly). Thus in the time where they can stop the degeneration in the rest of the body from cell division, they also have to figure out how to prolong the degeneration of brain cells which cannot be simply rebuilt. I am sure humans will figure that one out also. <br><br>But to be honest, I think the idea of having to live forever as a human is actually terrifying. I know the natural order is to eventually die, and who knows what happens after that period.

So, if years pass, our lives are still the same through that entire time and we didn&#39;t do much that was very memorable because it was the same as always, then it feels like time passed quickly because there&#39;s not much to measure in our memories. So, I think it&#39;s about doing novel things and also about how much our lives seem to change over the time period. When a person goes from age 5 to age 10, that person changes a lot.

It takes another 10 years to fall 5%.  Then we find our place in society and become complacent drones that take life for granted, as if another year of life is guaranteed.

Amazingly informative and educational.<br><br>I watched another video about how our genetics could be the cause of our sleeping patterns i.e &quot;chromotypes&quot;. As I&#39;m a bit of a night owl thought it was an interesting subject to look further into.<br><br>I was referred to something called the Suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) which contains something called the Circadian Locomotor Output Cycles Kaput gene or &#39;CLOCK&#39; gene for short. Which appears to be responsible for our bodies circadian rhythms as these genes turn on and off throughout the day regulating our sleeping pattern.<br><br>I also read that they took the SCN from one &#39;early riser&#39; hamsters. And replaced them with normal average hamsters SCN. They found that the hamsters still went to sleep at the same time as before. They claim this is because our body has multiple internal clocks which keep the information given from our SCN. So it retained the the pattern from before.<br><br><b>Edit: The above statement is which was dictated to me from material I&#39;ve read but I&#39;m struggling to find the source material to fact check this. Especially since I&#39;ve found two conflicting pieces of dialog. One stating that the hamsters did infact take the traits of the SCN which they inherieted and another one saying they didn&#39;t.

As time passes I feel like the months in which I didn&#39;t do anything out of the routine passed by fast because there&#39;s not much to remember them by. Meanwhile the months in which I did something novel are remembered more strongly, and that gets a plus from the sense of &quot;using well&quot; my time with something different. <br><br>So I believe that old people feel that their time passes faster because they are used to living everyday, years in a row, inside the same routine (be it wake up-work-sleep or wake up-watch TV-take a walk-sleep). It gets repetitive and every day feels like a COPY of the last one. If you live like you&#39;re inside a Groundhog Day life will fly by AND you&#39;ll be bored. In this sense I kind of disagree with the video, but I may be wrong. So, I think that to live &quot;longer&quot; you also have to make the most of your life. Not only you&#39;ll be making the most of it but you will also remember it as if it was longer. It will have the same duration, but it will be longer because it&#39;s not the time that counts, but how you use it. <br><br>If you live 100 years doing the same routine almost every day, your life will seem short compared to someone who lived 50 years but traveled to a new place every week. Also the old argument of 1 year being a lot to a 10-year-old and 1 year being little to a 90-year-old works like that because a 90-year-old probably doesn&#39;t do much other than stay at home and watch the same TV show every night, whereas a 10-year-old finds new, novel things to do and discover every day.<br><br>I want to travel, write books, learn to play instruments, record videos, meet interesting people and exotic places. I&#39;m sure life will &quot;be&quot; much longer that way than if I just followed a cut-out squared routine. And if you&#39;re reading this and you&#39;re stuck in a boring work schedule that drains the time out of your life, escape it before you regret it! Try being an entrepreneur, try mixing what you love to do with something that also makes money to support a living, you only got one life, you don&#39;t have to live it for the expectation of others, make it the most awesome, interesting life you can, instead of fitting in with what others want and wasting your time. <br><br>There are thousands of ways to spend this moment, this day you are presented with - be creative. Many times I myself fail to make the most of my day, but we shouldn&#39;t give up. Be thankful and force yourself to do something new and interesting whenever you can, create projects on the side: want to write a book? Want to explore a cave or some woods? Want to create a YouTube channel to record your good, funny times or to talk about literature, science or just games? Just do it. Make your life more than a burning candle: make it a project about constructing something to be proud of, be it memories or something external.", "comment_date": "2016-03-26T15:09:39Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "\u03b3\u00e9le\u03bfh", "comment_text": "what about sleep", "comment_date": "2016-03-26T07:27:21Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "ninja177771", "comment_text": "The dog and car picture thing didn&#39;t work for me.

The claim was that almost all animals have the same average of heartbeats per lifetime, which means that the difference in actual living years depends on the heart rate or the metabolism. For smaller animals usually the heart rate is fast so they only live a few years while larger animals have slower heart rates and live for several years. The exception being tortoises who although are relatively small they have really slow  metabolisms and can live for hundreds of years.<br>The upshot of this would be that as your metabolism gets faster, you experience time in smaller slices, so you accomplish more or can move and react faster. A small spider is hard to catch because it lives with a different time frame than ours.<br>This got me thinking of our own experiences as children, and as +Veritasium attested, where time seemed to last for ever.<br>So I believe that, among other things, also metabolism plays a part in our time perception. As kids our metabolism and heart rate are faster, slowing down as we get older. Maybe metabolism somehow affects the neuron response times as well.<br>Another affect of this is in a tense or in a state of emergency, we are flooded with adrenaline which increases the heart rate which in turn increases the time perception so you can react faster.", "comment_date": "2016-02-22T11:20:17Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "sachin hanel", "comment_text": "lol the subtitles translator arachnophobes to &#39;iraq new folks&#39; lol", "comment_date": "2016-02-22T09:21:20Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Kangaroo :D", "comment_text": "Who else thought the car was longer?", "comment_date": "2016-02-22T05:50:21Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "PhenomRom", "comment_text": "You ever done planks?

However in a near death experience like say when you narrowly miss a car accident, you react faster because of how your brain routes the signals.

Does current time feel like forever to them since they don\u2019t remember a large part of their past and constantly \u201cre-discover\u201d things ? Of course the amount of memories we have is not infinite, we do forget about meanless things to make space for relevant things, but in this case I wonder how that works. Could it be that they have less \u201cprocessing power\u201d and thus time flys by because it takes more time to process a given number of things. Is time perception related to memories at all ? If it is like so, the best way to get time to fly by is to keep doing new things you\u2019ve never done before. Another thing to consider is how \u201cactive\u201d you are when you perceive time. If you are running you\u2019ll feel like each stride lasts much longer (relatively) than a single step when walking even though your cadence is higher. Could it be connected to your heart rate ?

Smaller organisms have shorter pathways, thus information typically transits throughout the whole more rapidly then a larger organism.

Change is the only real thing that you can measure, whether it is the arrow of the wristwatch or the electron transitions in an atomic clock.

Think about it this way, when you perceive 1 second of elapsed time, you are internally comparing the &quot;count&quot; from a past memory till now.  So if the situation you are in requires a heightened sense of awareness (like being scared of the spider in front of you), your senses record MUCH more information about every second of that time, and thus in memory, more information equates to more time spent (Lasts longer).  On the other hand, if you do something you enjoy, your feeling of enjoyment is fleeting, and time is remembered shorter.  Playing a basketball game takes an hour, with maybe 5 minutes of good feelings scoring the point, making the play or winning at the end.  Those 5 minutes are what you remember, your brain equates that remembered time to the passage of an hour and it appears to just fly along.", "comment_date": "2016-02-10T16:38:39Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "hornetluca", "comment_text": "To me at <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aIx2N-viNwY&amp;t=3m55s\">3:55</a> the image that lasted the longest was the car not the dog.<br>What&#39;s wrong with my perception of time :-O", "comment_date": "2016-02-10T16:38:26Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "swimuniverse", "comment_text": "Look at the rat at <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aIx2N-viNwY&amp;t=2m50s\">2:50</a>.
