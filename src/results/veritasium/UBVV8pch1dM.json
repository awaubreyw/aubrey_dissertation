Similar to adrenaline being pumped at specific times vs all throughout the day.  In this scenario, the pupils dilating seems that the brain believes better eye sight is needed to help the body focus on the target (numbers in front). Probably to be able to intake information more accurately via visual stimulus.  It is similar to when we are driving, when we are trying to read a map, road signs, back up, or figure out which direction to go...we often turn down the radio...not that sound has anything to do with driving, but because we are instinctively eliminating a sense (sound) that is not needed in the calculation of direction enabling greater focus on sight for better perception/spatial recognition.  Modernize the times and add GPS or a navigator (think rally) and now you&#39;re including audio but only for specific cues like &#39;left&#39;, &#39;right&#39;, &#39;bear left&#39;, etc. so more of the senses are being used to perform the tasks.  I would attribute the pupils dilating to that of say a limited slip differential or perhaps a 4 wheel drive car with independent power for each wheel.  As you adjust one sense, or wheel in the example, it adjusts all the others. If you increase one, then you decrease the others...which makes sense because if you are in intense focus/thought, you can be oblivious to your surroundings, like tunnel vision.", "comment_date": "2022-08-08T15:42:50Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Dion Tchokreff", "comment_text": "Ah yes, rezources", "comment_date": "2022-08-08T02:07:25Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Holee JR", "comment_text": "Lol easy questions ever", "comment_date": "2022-08-07T20:33:03Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "lygophile", "comment_text": "so then how does improvisation work?", "comment_date": "2022-08-07T18:25:24Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Tony Hammitt", "comment_text": "Someone once said &quot;confusion is the physical sensation of learning&quot; and I&#39;ve repeated that to my kids quite often.", "comment_date": "2022-08-07T15:08:51Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "cando channel", "comment_text": "i think brain thinking is what your brain knows", "comment_date": "2022-08-07T14:05:17Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Divya Prakash", "comment_text": "Hi Derek.

Unfortunately they didn&#39;t stop the constant decline. But they allowed me to see who I am. Someone who loves maths, programming, physics.

I feel stupid, like my brain needs to work a lot harder than others&#39; because Drew is pretty much always in the driver&#39;s seat. Is there a condition for this? I totally identify with Drew. I have short-term memory (which didn&#39;t used to be the case when I was a kid) and feel like I&#39;m constantly flailing in confusion in every situation. Maybe that&#39;s why I have executive dysfunction? Not so much because I&#39;m trying to avoid using Drew, but because Drew already has his hands full with living. I&#39;m constantly uncomfortable. <br><br>   I think it&#39;s also worth pointing out that, given a time limit and audience, everyone will be reliant on Gun for answers. Otherwise you&#39;d just stand there in silence.

It is that certain types of thought that are uncomfortable to some people sometimes under some conditions. Whether they are any good at it or not, is a different question. Amazingly you have fallen into the very same trap...because for you it is far more comfortable for you to think negatively than positively. You prefer to sow doubt, to undermine assumptions, to be critical, to destroy confidence rather than increase confidence. And so here now you have trapped yourself with the very concept of thought itself. So what do you do, naturally? You turn that high-power brain of yours into a self-destruct mechanism and indeed, attempt to immolate the entire human race right along with yourself. You prefer to have nihilistic thoughts. You are far from the only person like that. But you are also far from exemplary of humanity as a whole. <br><br>What you should have done with this idea was to continue to sample the population until you were able to ask a range of questions to create a mental space in which you could objectively sample the population with those same questions, and then be able to calculate the likelihood of correct answers based on the answers to the setup questions. You always start with something truly simple, easy, even obvious.<br><br>How much time does it take for the earth to revolve around the sun? <br>Sure. Easy. Obviously not easy enough! <br><br>These questions have to require near-zero thought. Because some people are just that stupid, lazy and thoughtless.<br><br>On the topic of astronomy. <br><br>They&#39;re probably not scientists.<br><br>Doesn&#39;t mean that &quot;thinking&quot; is uncomfortable for them. Just thinking about astronomy. <br><br>...and as for you, it&#39;s obviously logical thought that is uncomfortable for you. <br><br>You keep raising doubts and undermining common scientific assumptions because you hate to think logically.<br>You&#39;d much rather think illogically and combine your illogic with a hot-button scientific topic. <br>You prefer to think of the absence of logic than the presence of logic. <br><br>For you, the fact that such answers to such questions are wrong is easy for you to see, because you PREFER to think about errors in logic, discrepancies between &quot;known facts&quot; and &quot;truth&quot;. For the people who gave you such answers, probably the opposite. <br>&quot;Earth revolves around the sun in a day? Yeah, sounds right to me&quot;. <br><br>And there you go. <br>You&#39;re happy, they&#39;re slightly less than happy, but only because they barely care about being wrong about astronomy.<br>Ask them questions about something they actually care about and see what happens to the quality of their answers. <br><br>Just as you love to come up with these corner issues of physics that most mainstream scientists care little to nothing about other than the fact that they are raised about a topic that they do actually care about.

Of course a non graduate wouldn&#39;t be able to save $6,000 that fast. It would have been difficult even for a graduate to get a job that helped him earn that much in a short period of time. So here I am 8 years later finally almost ready to return, both financially and mentally, but I find that my mind has certainly grown lazier. But there is something within me that longs to learn again. I used to be good at it. There&#39;s a certain flow to it.  Working in bars and restaurants was stimulating at first, because I was never that good with people, so learning to get along with others took a lot of effort. Now, however, I once again long for stimulating mental activity.  More than dish washing or serving drinks at a bar can afford.  I hope my mind isn&#39;t too old to grasp new information any more.

The biggest change I did was constantly studying, processing the information, and practicing everything taught every singular day until it was second nature instead of playing the game on autopilot. The other incredibly important shift was watching myself and having a clear-headed mental and learning to be less toxic and tilt less. <br><br>I had more motivation to play the game than study for school, so I remember everything for the game than I do most of the topics I learned in school at the time. In your example, I forced &#39;Drew&#39; to go through everything for LoL every day until &#39;Gun&#39; could process that information much quicker and have it memorized as if I was just going through daily life. School, on the other hand, I do not remember as much of what I learned but I remember the process for applications depending on the class(Mostly engineering). <br><br>At the current moment, I am trying to do the exact same with Valorant because LoL has become unenjoyable and unbalanced. I&#39;m going through many of the same learning difficulties in Valorant that I did for LoL, but it has been much easier because I have already gone through the process of becoming recognizably skilled on a completely different game: League and Osu. It would have been much easier if I was better at an FPS genre game and transferred the skills because the genre of the game is the same; instead, I have to go through the entire learning curve again because MOBAs, FPSs, and a Rhythm game are very different categories but some skills have been able to translate helping my understanding and differences. <br><br>This was an interesting video and I enjoyed watching it and all your other stuff :D", "comment_date": "2021-12-25T17:10:10Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Abhishek Bharti", "comment_text": "He summed up thinking fast and slow book in 10 mins.

He already tells us the cost of the bat. He says it costs a dollar more. In literally all math problems, this would mean what it sounds like, $1 full stop. By being vague with &quot;a dollar more&quot; and not meaning just 1 dollar, it could be that the ball costs 7 cents and the bat costs 1.03. Because 1.05 isn&#39;t just a dollar more, it&#39;s 1.05 more. <br>So the question is worded in a misleading way that could technically have up to 11 answers:<br>1.00 and 10 cents<br>1.01 and 9 cents<br>1.02 and 8 cents<br>1.03 and 7 cents<br>1.04 and 6 cents<br>1.05 and 5 cents<br>1.06 and 4 cents<br>1.07 and 3 cents<br>1.08 and 2 cents<br>1.09 and 1 cent<br>1.10 and 0 cents.<br>So people who gave the first thing that came to their mind (quick math, that follows what is said), don&#39;t feel bad. It&#39;s a trick question that is worded vaguely on purpose. In all other instances, saying &quot;a dollar more&quot; means one dollar more, because the word, &quot;A&quot; means one. A helicopter is one helicopter, not a 1.05 helicopters or 1.07 or 2. A helicopter more means one more helicopter, not a fraction of a helicopter. So it&#39;s not 1.05 necessarily because that would be more than &quot;a dollar more&quot;. <br><br>If he wanted the answer to be solidly 1.05, he should have said &quot;the bat costs its own price minus the ball, and is over 1 dollar&quot;, which would mean it would have to subtract evenly to get 1.10.

Even to consider that there is a concept of repetition is not useful in learning, because no two moments are and never will be the same - there will always be something new to become aware that will be presented to the present person. It\u2019s what we give attention to and how we get different perspectives of the desired, intended action, through genuine curiosity, because we understand the meaning and significance of knowing the information that will allow us to fully embody that knowledge, that will make a difference in the long run, IMO, because we know why we are learning for that specific purpose. Which part/half of our brain is responsible for determining purpose, comes to mind...?<br><br>In terms of personal experience, I found learning to play more non-dominant, left-handed tennis helped my dominant, right-handed tennis improve, because I was activating more of my right brain, Drew, due the brain-cross-body connection. I attributed the improvements due to the right brain having a fuller implicit understanding of the body and movement, which filled in the gaps that my left brain seeked to fill - Gun and Drew were having a continually-evolving, progressive, stimulating, never-boring conversation about the emergence of awareness. :)<br><br>I\u2019m curious to know if the harpist has tried learning to play by switching hands, to mirror her movements, and see if she would learn faster.<br><br>Lastly, collective / inter-generational trauma is a growing awareness and the effects trauma has on brain development is a significant influence, so I think it\u2019s worthwhile to consider how trauma (obvious and non-obvious, or \u201cBig T\u201d vs \u201clittle t\u201d) reduces the engagement of the right brain-left brain communication and to what extent and frequency this lack of engagement takes place, because right brain is associated with connecting to feelings, emotions, and sensations within the body.<br><br>Thanks again for your videos, Derek! :)", "comment_date": "2021-07-10T12:25:01Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Jonathan Krieger", "comment_text": "I read TEA CAT", "comment_date": "2021-07-10T12:18:07Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "cl0udburst", "comment_text": "Excellent video.

We&#39;re not hairy because we wear clothes.  We don&#39;t have claws or sharp fangs because we built clubs and spears.  You get the idea.

A certain level of accomplishment may be fulfilling, but your endless is not fun.  Working too hard to achieve a result is irritating.  It means you&#39;re spending more of your time and energy on a thing you just want done.  We use tools to do things faster because just by hand is long, hard, tedious, and possibly exhausting.  Making better tools gets more work down for less of the effort, but alot of thought had to go into the invention of such things, and it wasn&#39;t just one breakthrough, but generally a long line of smaller breakthroughs just to get to your powerdrill.<br><br>To that end, thinking is really only hard because the problem is complex and a time-saving means to an answer was not readily available.  I am well-educated and physically capable, but I am not against using a calculator or a wrench or something.

Also one of the patterns would regularly recur and we could predictably be asked to remember every box even if the order of recall demanded was usually different. It did take up most of my working memory trying to memorise the recurring pattern at the expense of being able to remember the the more unpredictable patterns that followed it and you couldn&#39;t help but invest because you knew that eventually there would be a higher chance of recalling the entire set and being successful, when the following pattern could only ask you to recall one box and you wouldn&#39;t even know which one it was, so you could have been looking at the completely wrong part of the screen wasting a possible &#39;victory&#39;. Eventually the recurring pattern got committed to longer term memory freeing up my working memory for the more randomised patterns but I feel like I was doing a form of chunking by remembering clusters of colours we already associate with eachother, such as RedGreenBlue or CyanMagentaYellowKey (black) sets.

Rationality is best when it comes AFTER intuitions have made the necessary assumptions,  made relevant impressions, and created distant associations.  - that&#39;s when rationality is most valuable.

The Bible states that no one is good: we have all sinned and fallen short of the glory of God, you have very probably at least once in your life lied, or stolen something even if it was small, probably you have often used God&#39;s name in vain (as in omg) which is called blasphemy, you have for sure had sexual thoughts about someone, so to sum it all up: you would be a lying, thieving blasphemus adulteror at heart, which is only 4 of the 10 commandments and you probably have broken them all. And for this we deserve hell! One single sin is enough to send you to hell.\u00a0 And by doing good deeds, like loving everyone helping people ecc... we can not possibly cancel our previous sins and gain the favour of God. The only way we can get to heaven is through the Lord Jesus! I will explain that better: God has His Holy and just wrath prepared to fall upon all sinners, and we completely deserve that, but in God&#39;s infinite mercy He sent his only begotten Son to live a perfect life on this earth (something we could not possibly do ourselves) and to finally die on the cross bearing our sins and taking upon Himself the wrath of God that was supposed to be for us! True conversion is realizing that we are completely lost and putting our whole trust in the Lord Jesus and we will be cleansed by His blood, because He already bore our sins! In this way The Father will see us as pure through Jesus! As proof of our salvation we will automatically start hating the sin we once were slaves to and we will love God and His commandements! This doesn&#39;t mean that we won&#39;t be tempted by our past sins but if we get overcomed by temptation we will still hate the sin that we fall into. That is the gospel! And that is the only way you get to heaven and a few understand it.

My mother taught me to read, write, add, subtract, multiply, and divide all before i got into kindergarten i was reading dean koontz and Stephen king while my teachers taught my peers to read. As such i learned to read and enjoy reading and learning before i was exposed to them at school where they boringly pound info at you like your some kinda of drum. now for as long as i can remember ive genrally been a thinker if someone askes me something i pause for a moment to think before responding. i tend to enjoy games videos and other media that make you think and stimulate the mind. Now dont get me wrong sometimes gun gets a hold of the wheel and does what it is he does but most of the time i like to think through questions and situations BEFORE proceeding. do you think its possible that beginning the learning process at a younger age in a funner way could cause a person to be more &quot;drew minded&quot; rather than &quot;gun minded&quot; or do you think its more simply that people are &quot;wired&quot; to see things, feel things, and think things in different ways and that some people are just more analytical where are others are more driven to act.", "comment_date": "2019-09-23T16:26:27Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "L.S.

This applies to everything including our priorities and politics. But of course it includes a lot more than memory, and memory is actually no way to describe cognition. The video is sometimes conflating cognition with memory. Even in muscle memory, it&#39;s not the fact that memory is involved that is key, but what is being remembered. We are inappropriately fascinated with memory and data. Those concepts are meaningless. It&#39;s like saying it&#39;s important to have a place to store food. Well no it&#39;s even more important that food is edible and not poison.  It is not raw data that is in our memory that is the important part. It is the stored &#39;subroutine&#39;s of processing.  So the quality of memories and processing is what matters, not the concept of memory and data. The memory games are just not so relevant. Also in addition to &#39;subroutines&#39;. we also store &#39;societal norms&#39; that we are &#39;programmed&#39; to believe in and adhere to, even if they are irrational and actually are bad for us all. But despite these comments the overall message in the video is still valuable. Thinking better does take more effort and also developing better &#39;stored subroutines&#39; and even going back and checking on them and updating them takes even more effort. But our quality of thoughts is directly related to our quality of civilization. So our very survival may depend on our interest in thinking better, especially about things that determine the course of our culture and societies, like how we vote and what sort of improvements we think we need in our educational priorities. But really it&#39;s what we think about most everything that determines our civilization. Only things that are truly opinions make no difference. And that is a set of things much smaller than we currently and mistakenly normalized ourselves to believe. If you want to know if something is an opinion or not look at the consequences of having a different view. If you prefer soccer over baseball that has almost no consequence for us. If you prefer lawlessness or  &#39;freedom to kill whoever you like&#39; to having and enforcing laws, that has consequences for us and it&#39;s not an opinion that lawlessness is worse for us than some order. If you prefer to not being interested in our being accountable to reason, that has consequences, so it&#39;s not an opinion, it&#39;s factually a less desirable view. This quickly gets harder when there are consequences for both of two opposing or different views, but there are often ways of sorting that out too, ways that we generally don&#39;t care about learning or making important. The course of humanity over the centuries are the sum of us all over time. How much of an interest we each take in the quality of our views, the quality of everyone&#39;s views,  seems to be the most important thing there is. That implies not just that you look directly at views and try to sort them out, but that you look directly at what determines the quality of the process by which we form those views and quality with which you look at those views. Metacognition. It should be a whole field itself. Don&#39;t just think about things, more importantly seek to  learn how to think better about things.  You have to actively go and study how to think better, not what to think. And that area is not remotely prioritized the way it must be if we are to progress more and reverse some of the regression we are experiencing. We sometimes wonder if all intelligent life in the universe eventually destroys itself or falls due to poor priorities and not being prepared. We can&#39;t quite answer that question, but we can know that how much we prioritize the quality of our thinking and collective judgment determines how  prepared we are to protect ourselves from ourselves and other threats, and that it directly affects the quality of our lives and the lives of our future selves.

Imagine that Drew, being the first person in the house had a younger brother named Gun. Gun is a genius but sometimes gets too overwhelmed with all of the sensory input. Drew, being very smart tells a very anxious Gun, lets switch places. But instead of handing off the info, Drew allows gun to just make the decisions with confidence, without fear, without logic. He just processes. Now, when they switch back, Gun has no problem handling the work on his own. <br><br><br>Okay. Wunderbar. Now, imagine that Drew wants to learn 5 languages, be a cook, fashion designer, and an opera singer. Well, thinks Drew, that is just too much work for one person. It would take a village... It would take an efficient company. So Drew invites his mother, father, and siblings, and cousins to live with him and delegates one task to each. With every new skill, another family member is invited and so forth until there is an entire ecosystem of people living inside of Drew. This is not an illusion.

There was this building that had elevators, so once I get off the elevator on the correct floor, I would have to either turn right or left for my classroom, but in the beginning, since I didn&#39;t know where it was, I would have to guess. So I guess right, and then realize my mistake (because classrooms were in descending order and I was looking for 405 when the classrooms I was seeing were 406 and onwards), turn around and then proceed to my classroom. After repeating this the first three days, I would find myself making the same mistake over and over, and it became part of my routine, and it took conscious effort to avoid making the mistake.

Diagnosed with autism (ASS) this year, it seems my brain works the same way as anybody else&#39;s. I have a Drew, I have a Gun. It just feels like the personalities of Gun and Drew are more alike, sometimes even reversed. Drew is less lazy and takes on things that other people would leave to Gun, Gun is still the faster one, but Drew is a bit of a control freak and doesn&#39;t like the sloppy bits of Gun&#39;s work. (Which in the long run means Gun is even less accurate, because he doesn&#39;t enough practice and Drew becomes more and more &#39;right&#39; about him). This makes me less prone to errors, makes me able to do things of the bat, that most people would struggle with, but makes me struggle with things nobody worries about and have a very hard time automating skills. I still struggle with things like left and right, but can easily swap them, which most people would struggle with. Also the example you gave of inverting the bike steering (which is easy to do if you cross your arms on the handlebars) made all of my friends fall, while I just adjusted mostly by favoring one hand and reducing the complexity of the problem. I thought that was the trick, but nobody seemed to get it, even when I explained how to do it. Now I am not so sure. It seems that things that are unconscious for most people are conscious processes for me, like body language. I too have unconscious processes, that are completely Gun&#39;s domain, like object-recognition, reading, language etc, but I&#39;m much more aware of them than most people, which is why I like optical illusions. Since I observe my inner workings more than most, this shows me that my brain is actually better at some stuff, which is kind of reassuring if you feel inadequate and socially awkward all the time. The best description of what it feels like to have autism I found was: Alien planet syndrome. Like you are stuck on a planet where everything is illogical. Now I&#39;m not claiming this is what autism is, especially since autism was all lumped together in ASS. But I am not suggesting this is what was used to be known as Asperger&#39;s feels like for everybody, it is just what it feels like for me. Maybe this helps someone, who struggles with being labeled with such a broad term, that has such negative associations for most people, like I did for a long time.<br>Back to your excellent video..<br>Observing myself it feels like there are more layers than just Drew and Gun. I think things like stereoscopic vision or non-logic interpretation and filtering of data are done by someone I&#39;d call the Flash...(Since Gun is already superlative). He can hardly be seen, only by his results can he be known and can we figure out in which order he processes things. And underneath that, there is someone without a name, who can flood the system with emotions and can make decisions, like fight or flight mode, or the snake reflex, before even the Flash can move his feet. I see emotions as the Gas that Drew and Gun breathe. Sometimes these gases are a bit intoxicating, sometimes it&#39;s like there is Helium, nitrous oxide, in there or in the case of depression or mourning it feels like it&#39;s a heavy, sticky fluid. So this would be the part where my Drew tells me, that even though I liked the video and I gained some new insights from it, Drew feel it&#39;s dangerously sloppy and inaccurate as most metaphors are.. It seems to be something Gun would say and I get the urge to check.

There are many differences between Reading vs Studying. My definition of reading: you read the text, you understand the each word and rely on reflex a lot. Studying will be understand the fundamental concept of the statement. You will be able to answer all the question related to the statement.<br><br>Example <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBVV8pch1dM&amp;t=11m23s\">11:23</a> (watching video) is the example of some people will just read Derek&#39;s statement (Guy in the vid) rather than study his statement. How many people will question themselves in the head &quot;what does he mean when he said sensation of understand?&quot; &quot;Why watching video give sensation of understand than learning? did i missed something?&quot;.<br><br>Other example, a simple text like &quot;Lazy is wrong&quot; most people understand it and practise it. But will failed to answer why it is wrong. Typical answer will be &quot;Because you need to work&quot;, &quot;you need to get a job&quot; &quot;because is not good&quot; &quot;because you need to take care of yourselves&quot;. If one would STUDY that statement, he/she will start to question the statement. Example the process of STUDYING will be .....what happen if one become lazy....mmmm...lets scale the population to smaller...let&#39;s say we only have 3 people in earth....HUMAN1: have a chicken farm &amp; selling chicken as source of food. HUMAN2: Create clean and drinkable water. HUMAN3: Not doing anything: lazy. So now i have 3 human that consume but only 2 that produces. Consume &gt; produce...which mean in a long-run food will get lesser and lesser. This is why they said, you need to work.<br>This is now just happening in educational video, it happened in school book too and everywhere, including a person&#39;s speech...&quot;do not run with scissor&quot; &quot;do not curse&quot; &quot;respect your elders&quot; &quot;Go study, exam next week&quot;. How many of us STUDY these simple phrase WHY, WHAT IF, HOW, WHY NOT...<br><br>Not trying to say that everyone should use Drew than Gun. They both have their reason of existence. After you have learnt how to twist a door knob, it have become your reflect so you don&#39;t need to learn every time when you open a door or pronounce a word, using a keyboard. In our world we need some balance, some job required more Drew&gt;Gun (creating new product, designing new ads, research) some jobs need more Gun&gt;Drew (routine job, job that require more physical movement like wrapping a gift, operating a machine).<br><br>Gun vs Drew, is a story-telling way to let audience to have an imagination so that audience wont get bored. There are more to study how thinking work: how data turn into information, how reflex work. You know you&#39;re studying when you question it to its core.<br><br>The video is not trying to offend audience to watch it. But sort of like creating a path or gauge you, opening a topic. In order for you to use drew, you need to use it yourselves rather than given an instruction to use Drew. The journey of using Drew is very important, whether or not Drew&#39;s conclusion is right or wrong. Example how the apple fell on Newton and spark his Drew to think. Newton will not use Drew if apple did not fall. Just like any this video spark you to use Drew.", "comment_date": "2018-06-21T09:06:05Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "TheDirthound", "comment_text": "This still doesn&#39;t explain why I&#39;m a dumbass .", "comment_date": "2018-06-20T04:16:45Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Raul Diaz", "comment_text": "This video helped to be more optimistic about learning very hard things.

We see that thinking can be broadly divided into two systems of thinking, system 1 or gun and system 2 or drew. We can also see gun as intuition and drew as effortful, purposeful and deliberate processing. Gun breaks information into chunks and patterns of comprehension so that the processing is swift and we can act quickly. While at the same time, it is also much more prone. Drew on the other hand, deliberately finds reasoning, makes calculations and reaches a solution through steps. Drew is less prone to error. Drew&#39;s precision can be transferred on to gun for it&#39;s swiftness through practice.

You wouldn&#39;t actually end up switching the lights on or off incorrectly merely due to the directional difference, because what you would actually do is attempt to flip the switch to the direction it was already in, having no effect. For what you describe to happen, you would have to attempt to hit one part of the switch, have nothing happen, then slide to the other part and press it. Now, in my own home, I do sometimes accidentally turn the lights off on myself, or on when I mean to leave, if I previously left the lights in a state I normally don&#39;t. For example, if I left the bathroom light on by accident early in the day, and returned later, I might accidentally turn them off when entering -- even though there&#39;s no confusion about the direction of the switch. Instead, it&#39;s merely the act of flipping the light switch when entering or exiting that&#39;s familiar, and the fact that I&#39;m not taking conscious account of the lights already being on or off when I do it. My point is that it&#39;s not the direction of the switch that&#39;s important, but rather the act of pressing it. If I put my hand up to the switch (because I left the light on earlier and forgot, or in your case because you had directional confusion in Australia) and nothing happens -- even if the lights are already in the state I want them -- I&#39;m probably going to flick it the other way, and then get annoyed because I turned the lights off on myself!", "comment_date": "2017-12-12T22:35:34Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Ignacio Rodr\u00edguez Fern\u00e1ndez", "comment_text": "I disagree.

We have all experienced this automation either by the passing of minutes whilst driving and wondering &quot;where did the last few miles go&quot; when we finally reactivate the conscious mind to wondering why we yelled or got angry at people we love yet when we consciously review it we regret the unconscious actions that were said and done in those compulsive moments. This is a concept that is thousands of years old yet still persists to this day, just modernized, to be honest it gives it even more merit. Mystical traditions suggest attempting to expend the majority of your effort focused on conscious observation of reality whilst observing what the unconscious mind is attempting to influence and then continuously bring about change in perspective as a result of this effort. The ultimate secret is that science postulates the existence of many more dimensions to reality via such theories as string theory, the consequence of these theories on us as beings sharing that same reality is that everything points to perspective being the way in which we navigate these new dimensions, we just have to push against  the (automation) inertia to do so. There&#39;s a part of yourself that is constantly informing you what needs to be done regardless of where you are situated in this life, don&#39;t get into that drunk drivers car, you need to quit drinking so heavily, your addicted to video games and need to pay attention to your significant other, start focusing on healthy eating, move to a quieter location where you can hear your conscious voice better. Once the initial burdens are overcome and we pay attention to this conscious part of ourselves we begin a journey that takes us on a path towards enlightenment, a path of perspective shifting that very few every decide to pursue. This path ultimately leads to encapsulating realities on a scale that are incomprehensible to most people, and i say this not with a smugness but with a calm knowing that the average person will not be able to relate to it.  The unconscious mind will attempt to explain where this leads but only the strong will resist the urge to take comfort in this false narrative. Our perspective is able to extend beyond anything you can imagine, those fighting the inertia will discover this and be lead to destinations outside the grasp of those not pursuing such perspectives and will ultimately find salvation, though i hesitate to use this term due to it&#39;s Christian influence but i am without another term to describe it&#39;s reality.", "comment_date": "2017-09-19T14:22:04Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Marwan Shamsia", "comment_text": "This is just simply a life changing 12 minute video", "comment_date": "2017-09-18T21:18:11Z", "likes_count": 157}, {"comment_by": "Doctor Dankeston", "comment_text": "So is taking Adderall basically the equivalent of overclocking drew?", "comment_date": "2017-09-16T12:15:50Z", "likes_count": 5}, {"comment_by": "Bruce Williams", "comment_text": "Excellent video.

Because it&#39;s a thought has has crossed my mind before, I do know that learning things is a conscious thing and takes effort, and these videos always felt &quot;too fun&quot; to be educational. But then I came to the conclusion that learning something doesn&#39;t <b>always</b> have to incorporate hard work. I fondly remember some physics classes back in school which were interesting to me mostly on the basis that the teacher made it very easy and, dare I say, fun, to digest the information, going over topics at a slow pace and using a lot of real life examples and experiments. I want to say these &quot;effortless&quot; hours of learning were more valuable to me than, say, sitting over math questions after school to not bomb a test, employing a LOT of effort, really putting in work and understanding stuff and frankly, suffering. Because all of that math, I forgot about it again, if I had to guess I&#39;d assume my brain knew full well I only had to know it for that short amount of time and that was it. But for the physics classes, those were memorable, enjoyable experiences - and I could still sketch up a graph and explain how a speaker works, or a doorbell and what have you, that stuff stuck to my mind. And even if it sounds clich\u00e9, I&#39;d go even further and say that some of the things I learned in those physics classes inspired me deeply, giving me a level of insight into how our world works that did a great deal of shaping who I am today. Making me curious to find out more, at some point trying to pursue a carreer in a technical field (which didn&#39;t turn out to be what I wanted to do but hey, it was a try) and maybe, just maaaybe, that is part of the reason why I find myself watching Veritasium videos now.<br><br>I do understand this is entertainment first and foremost. And that the reason people watch it is primarily because of the excellent presentation, not because of a deepfounded interest in the subjects. And I do understand you, Derek Muller, literally made your PhD thesis over what good videos are (or are not) for teaching people. So you may well be the single most qualified guy ever to make that assessment. And still, it&#39;s like, I don&#39;t know, if I don&#39;t learn anything watching this video I want to challenge the notion of what learning means and how valuable it is in the first place, because at the end of the day these videos stick in my head and I&#39;ll tell people about it and they shape my views and make for interesting conversations and make me ponder and isn&#39;t that everything that matters? Even if in the end, all that remains is a &quot;I&#39;ve seen something about that in a video once&quot; in a water cooler quip.

Think about how hard we&#39;re thinking when we&#39;re studying something new. No matter if it&#39;s a new language, algebra, new song on a guitar etc... The brain tricks us, it tricks us a lot.. The brains reward center is actually trying to fight against the whole learning process, making us procrastinate meaning: Doing something that gives us instant reward instead of doing something that would actually give us greater satisfaction in a future to come. Thinking is uncomfortable, learning is uncomfortable and the idiot inside our skulls is telling us to do something else, that rewards us faster. Oh geez... Then there&#39;s also cognitive dissonance, which is basically you have some information stored in your brain relating to some type of matter which is dear to you. Once new information comes pouring in which would actually change the way of your thinking about the same particular matter, the cognitive dissonance starts. It makes you feel uncomfortable and it&#39;s up to you: Do I accept this new information or do I go against it? Example: Flat-earthers still think the world is flat, even thou there&#39;s thousands upon thousands scientific facts and proven thesis&#39;s that say the earth is round... It also applies to media criticism, internet criticism and fact checking.. Take cognitive dissonance add thinking is uncomfortable add learning is uncomfortable and ask again, why people act the way they act? Why do we still have different opinions about climate change, history, religion, politics etc... It&#39;s a clusterpoop and I will always raise my hat and give my deepest respect for people who actually can process new information and change their way of thinking from wrong to right, since that is something that takes balls..", "comment_date": "2017-03-11T13:47:50Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Daniel Kornar", "comment_text": "I&#39;ve got ADD and I just pictured Gun constantly throwing things right into Drew&#39;s face.", "comment_date": "2017-03-11T13:47:38Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Soutrik Chakraborty", "comment_text": "can someone tell me how can I email Derek !??<br>I mean seriously ! <br>if I have some questions or some doubts about what he said , how do I contact him !???", "comment_date": "2017-03-11T13:44:02Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "\ua9c1\u0f12Andy Harris\u0f12\ua9c2", "comment_text": "Another awesome video.

There were a number of problems with this though. First, the lectures still happened at really early in the morning when people are still too sleepy to really do a lot of thinking. Second, rather than having a small class size to have access to the professor for questions and guidance, we were still in a massive lecture hall with a few hundred students. I may as well have been doing homework at home because being at lecture didn&#39;t help at all. In fact, the way they set it up was even worse than just having us do homework because we worked in groups and were timed, so in practice most people still didn&#39;t think about the problems because social and time pressure forced people to just accept the answer of the fastest person in the group.", "comment_date": "2017-03-08T14:36:11Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "jatin sharma", "comment_text": "<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBVV8pch1dM&amp;t=11m24s\">11:24</a> You just roasted my ass.", "comment_date": "2017-03-08T14:06:26Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "dx dt", "comment_text": "Am I the ony one to check if I had Kerbal Space Program running in the background?", "comment_date": "2017-03-08T13:58:21Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "dilly", "comment_text": "I prefer lectures tho", "comment_date": "2017-03-08T13:12:22Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Hesham Elshrkawy", "comment_text": "The moment you started talking about system 1 and system 2 I knew you&#39;ve read Thinking Fast And Slow", "comment_date": "2017-03-08T13:04:46Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "DHRUV CHAUHAN", "comment_text": "super one", "comment_date": "2017-03-08T13:01:48Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Wokis", "comment_text": "I think my Gunn (or Gun?) is partly broken :P.

There is very basic information processing going on the the brain and more complex before you get at the level of processing where Drew takes over. For autistic people, the most simple levels of processing, Guns job, is not being done very well as Gun doesn&#39;t have the same amount of resources to process the information which causes an overflow of info that Gun can&#39;t deal with. Gun passes this information to Drew which will process it to figure out the content but Drew gets easily exhausted. <br><br>However, more is going on. A more simple level of Gun&#39;s operation also passes information to a brother of Drew called Bryan who has the job of experiencing emotions and Gun definitely also doesn&#39;t filter the information for Bryan well which overloads Bryans emotional center and amplifies experiences. <br><br>During social interaction, Bryan is overloaded with info which dials its experience up way too high and Drew is overloaded with tasks to figure out what to do, which makes it difficult for Drew to find out what the hell is going on.<br><br>On an early age depending on the person, Drew discovers that by controlling its life, stimuli can be avoided or at least diminished to a degree where the load on itself and Bryan is sufficiently low. By making life predictable, Gun faces more familiar situations that he is able to handle better. However, because most of the information of Gun is social information, that particular briefcase overloads the easiest and thus, social interaction is the biggest part of life Drew wants to avoid in order to minimize the emotional burden. <br><br>However, due to the lack of social interaction, Gun doesn&#39;t get exposed to enough social situations to properly learn social behavior which limits its ability to function socially. This further intensifies the problem. From an early age, Gun isn&#39;t given the opportunity to practice. <br><br>Later in life, depending on the severity of Gun&#39;s inability to process information, Drew gets so much worked up that he becomes a mental body builder, able to handle so much information that he can slowly start to take over some of Guns workload and engage in more social interaction.<br><br>For the luckiest among us, given the right information and lessons, Drew can learn Bryan how to experience Guns information to produce positive emotions such as happiness and love which causes Bryan to tell Gun and Drew to engage in more social interaction so that it can experience happiness, and so that Gun and Drew both can become better at filtering social information to the point where Bryan is very satisfied with life and social interactions become pleasurable. After a sufficient amount of time, Drew trained the long term memory so that now, Gun delivers just enough of social information to Bryan in order to feel happy and Drew to have plenty of energy left to enjoy live.

It is at the heart of the fundamental flaw in civilization.  Not just OUR civilization, but the concept of civilization itself.  Civilization consists primarily of removing danger from peoples lives.  That danger is precisely what motivates people in visceral, personal ways to defy their intuition (which drives them only to repeat the same tragedy endlessly) and dedicate themselves to the effort of thinking.  So, then, civilization consists primarily of removing all tangible personal benefit to thinking.  <br><br>We construct grand infrastructure (when I say &#39;we&#39;, I mean the thinkers among us, the intellectuals) which keeps people safe and makes them comfortable.  We remove even the dangers which come as consequences of a persons own actions.  We strive for the point where no thought is necessary to live without danger.  As we approach that, however, we reach a tipping point.  A point where following ones intuition, which is effortless, becomes what a society values.  Where they can not see the benefit of expending the effort of thinking.  Mis-steps in thinking of the past are fixated upon and seen as proof that thinking is malign, that it is deception.  Intuition, after all, seeks to categorize all things with binary finality.  A thing is either Good or it is Bad.  Considering nuance takes effort, it takes thinking.<br><br>And as a number of people emerge who guide their lives through intuition rather than reason, they find themselves no worse for it.  They begin to teach their way of living to their children.  They look upon those who expend their energy on thinking with doubt, if not outright derision.  When those people ask things of them, or expect things of them, they see no reason to cooperate.  They stop vaccinating their children.  They seek refuge from food with &#39;chemicals&#39; in it.  When it comes time to approve a tax levy to continue to fund research or expand the infrastructure which has protected them their entire life, they refuse as it seems a total waste to them, if not an active menace.<br><br>They can not be reasoned with.  By definition, they reject reason and decide their beliefs based on trained Pavlovian conditioned responses (trained unintentionally and haphazardly by their life experiences and informed by nothing more).  You can not reason someone into accepting reason.  And if you batter or coerce them or manipulate them emotionally in order to relate to them in the way they prefer, you will have revealed yourself as a total hypocrite and your position will never be adopted.  They will continue in their certainty that the infrastructure is unnecessary or that it holds them back from the natural paradise which they are sure life without it could be.<br><br>And so they seek to remove the infrastructure.  You might think that as the danger re-asserts itself in the absence of the protective infrastructure that they would immediately realize their mistake.  But this is not how the human brain works.  This is not how intuition works.  Intuition is what defines every fallacy of argument and thinking we have ever formulated.  Intuition is ad hominem, is crude assumptions of causation from circumstantial correlation, etc.  And when danger re-asserts itself, the &#39;Sunk Cost fallacy&#39; comes to the fore.  They will believe they have not gone far enough.  With their child dead in their arms from a preventable disease due to not having them vaccinated, they will not realize that the entirety of their worldview is fundamentally wrong.  They will blame some other remaining aspect of the infrastructure.  And they will fight with twice as much vigor to have that other part removed, with a fire of passion that sways many who look for passion first in deciding what to believe.<br><br>So it will go, until humanity returns to their &#39;ground state&#39;, if you will.  The state in which humanity existed for tens of thousands of years before the development and spread of rational thought as an intentional system of evaluating ideas and of deciding how to live and act.  Slogging through mud, disfigured with the scars of disease, stumbling from famine to famine killing one another as tradition or over whose god is strongest.<br><br>This is the most significant problem facing the human species, in my opinion, and I see no ethical solution.  (I say ethical because the only ideas I can come up with are stupendously dark and radically unethical)  It seems fundamental in the definition of civilization and how the human brain works.", "comment_date": "2017-03-03T07:27:34Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "The Archive", "comment_text": "Halo reach music?", "comment_date": "2017-03-03T07:27:27Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Shabarish", "comment_text": "A SERIOUS QUESTION :<br>IS GUN THE ONE WHO GETS TRIGGERED ?", "comment_date": "2017-03-03T07:27:06Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "joe chu", "comment_text": "insurance? or did you mean.. unsurance?", "comment_date": "2017-03-03T07:22:14Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Frandaman84", "comment_text": "god, all that for a like? is there a tip jar i can&#39; toss a couple of bucks into?..", "comment_date": "2017-03-03T07:21:26Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Aryan Khemka", "comment_text": "What?!

It gives the feeling of understanding by handing out answers and claiming to be all knowing so that people don&#39;t have to invest the energy of being uncertain and second guessing themselves and authority figures. But sometimes people are wrong. Sometimes what has been believed for centuries turns out to be wrong. If no one ever goes outside of the &#39;handed down&#39; knowledge, then no one will ever know. They will just react with preprogrammed behaviors. Isn&#39;t that just instinct? If all we have is instinct, then we&#39;re just dumb animals, not intelligent life forms. Right? At the same time, I&#39;ll just point out... it seems to me that instinct is what we are. If we don&#39;t attend to our instincts, then 1. our species will die out 2. we won&#39;t have any attachment or motivation. We won&#39;t know what to do with ourselves. So, I think the more evolved aspect of religion is that it attempts to replace our inherent instincts with a better version, an upgrade. The problem is, it might still be an old rusty version and either way still treats us as brutish beasts, not intelligent beings. And actually, that&#39;s not just religion, but that is what culture in general does. Until you can alienate yourself from some aspect of your culture and consider it in a detached manner, you can&#39;t really ever judge it and can&#39;t know what it&#39;s real value is.

For me it doesn&#39;t matter if I&#39;m studying fluid dynamics or static engineering I almost always enjoy doing so. But I always need a target to learn by myself. I always think about a project to do to learn something. E.g. I want to learn something about aerostatic bearings so I decided to take apart a small engine and started to test how the crankshaft would behave if you use air as lubricant instead of oil. After I did the test I compared results and tried to lern what went well or wrong and tried to improve the testessembly after a few treys I had a working prototyp and a theory how an engine has to look like if you want to run it on air as lubricant. That&#39;s classic trial and error but it keeps the brain busy and is fun and you can write a wonderful classiest/exam or what not if you learn by practical experience rather than normal theoretical class practice. Of course no one needs to buy an engine to get the principals of the engine but you can hardly create what you never got your hands on. If you want to learn engineering engineer something. Don&#39;t get expensive stuff, try to repair e.g. A broken lawnmower or a toy car or a radio. Take it apart (pull the plug first) and try to find the error you can&#39;t brake things twice.

We often &quot;pick a side&quot; and then rather than revisiting our decisions, we instead figure out which side is ours. &quot;Gunn&quot; will bring up justifications for our side, and &quot;Drew&quot; will avoid conflicting information. It&#39;s easier... Gunn files conflicting information under &quot;Misguided opposition&quot; and that&#39;s all the excuse that Drew needs to not think further. We have this innate ability to write off information we&#39;d rather not think about. Drew isn&#39;t just lazy, he controls the garbage can. When Information requires thought, he can instruct Gunn to simply throw it away and devalue that information. Ironically, this is why many on the left see justification in blaming religion for the problems with education or abortion, but will see no irony in defending Islam from being called radical. Likewise the right can criticize immigration for a lack of jobs, but see no irony in lowering taxes of companies that hire foreign workers. Drew is very talented at short handing information. The chunks that help us remember stuff makes it so we can also assign quick values to information regardless of truth. When Obama said that women make 78% of what men make doing the same job. Many in my generation gave it value despite being a mischaracterization of the data. Given the &quot;Same job&quot; line, it was just simply not true. But those same people will criticize Trump for saying that he had a large crowd at his inauguration... despite the fact that the inauguration lie wasn&#39;t an attempt to pass legislation and had far less weight.

The  parallel refers to the serial whenever it realizes it doesn&#39;t have an immediate answer and requires help. So the more the parallel side refers to the serial side, say about playing the piano for example, the synapses between the two sides grows stronger and the information is grouped as big ass neurons in the serial side. And because the synapses become stronger(myelin), information is able to transmit almost immediately between the two sides, and the parallel side is able to send information to the rest of our body and cause motion. That&#39;s how muscle memory in athletics, music, etc is formed. I find it really interesting because that&#39;s how like theoretical physicists or computer scientists are able to solve these foreign-ass impossible-looking equations- they just store the simpler ones in giant neurons in the serial and are able to refer to them and the underlying concepts automatically and build easily on top of that.", "comment_date": "2017-03-02T18:24:48Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Monody", "comment_text": "I couldn&#39;t do the numbers thing, because I can only hold numbers in my memory as sound.<br>I read them aloud, then play the audio back in my head.

It&#39;s not that they don&#39;t want to put the effort in to think about it, they&#39;re just anxious. Likewise with the counting to the beat test, tests always put people under pressure and performing tasks to a timer is also stressful. It&#39;s not that the effort of adding is causing you to breathe faster and your pupils to dilate, it&#39;s that the situation is stressful and these are natural stress responses. When you&#39;re put into a situation like that, you do what every other frightened animal does: literally anything other than thinking.<br><br>So how this pertains to teaching, it all depends on the kind of question and how it&#39;s asked. If I ask you, &quot;Name the capital of Peru&quot;, there&#39;s a definite answer, it&#39;s a short answer delivered as if you should know it and I&#39;ve put you on the spot to answer it right now. If you&#39;re relaxed, you might pause and mull your way through various capital cities and countries, narrowing down the possibilities. If you&#39;re in a class, you&#39;re being watched by two dozen other people and you don&#39;t have time, so you won&#39;t think about it, you&#39;ll blurt an answer out. To actually get people involved and using their brains, you&#39;ve got to approach with an untargetted, open-ended question, so people start to think about what answer they could give, maybe even tell them specifically to pause for a moment and reflect on it. That&#39;s got to be more effective since you&#39;re putting people into their comfort zone while simultaneously getting them to think.<br><br>Consider when you do your best thinking. For me, it&#39;s absolutely always when I&#39;m alone in my room, no pressure on me, just sating my curiosity and taking my time to consider various answers to a problem that has been issued as something with no clear conclusion. That&#39;s how a good classroom should feel: you&#39;ve got time to think, there&#39;s no pointedly wrong answers, your reasoning is significant and maybe more interesting than your answer, so the focus is on the journey of thought and not so much the destination.<br><br><br>Geez that&#39;s a lot of text.
