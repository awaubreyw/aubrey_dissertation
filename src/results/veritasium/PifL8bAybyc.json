I mean, it is a huge difference from 3x10^-4 to fractions of 3x10^8, something less than 10^12 but around that, which represent the difference between graphene and a standard copper wire in terms of electron drift velocity. I believe the electric impulse is indeed that fast, but electric impulse and electron drift velocity are two different things. Not understanding that difference makes us believe that when we turn the light on, a single electron from the wire on the switch travels through the wire to the light bulb in a fraction of second, when truly what happens is that the electrons are &quot;pushing&quot; each other forward in a stream due to a difference in potential, so the electron that really turns the light on is the one in the wire right next to the light bulb.", "comment_date": "2014-11-02T14:12:00Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "G U S T T O X", "comment_text": "How do you even draw that perfect circle on that piece of sheet.

Every way that it is arranged is wonderful and amazing, partly on its own account and partly on its differentiation from other ways it is arranged. How are a pencil and a diamond similar? They are both carbon based. So are we. So are trees. So is the food we eat. We exhale the stuff. We grill steaks on it. It is in some of our lighting. It is abundant and cheap but also precious and rare (when arranged).<br><br>Sunlight, wind and carbon are where we should be looking for sustainability. Currently we exploit the rarest materials: Gold, copper, water, fossil fuels, titanium, trapped gasses... while the most abundant are under-exploited. The one abundant fuel that we have exploited but in the wrong way is nuclear power. We&#39;ve used fission instead of fusion. Fusion and graphene deserve much more research. We currently subsidize Big Oil to hunt for more oil in ever more sacred spaces (the ocean, the arctic, our national parks, etc) when we should put the billions into the research that holds the promise of quality of life (and life itself) for our children, not that which is destroying all we hold dear (or should hold dear).<br><br>Scientists... thank you for your labor of love, working to improve the future. Hacks, who serve corporate interests at the expense of the commons, regardless of the quality of your research you are no better than the demons.<br><br>And educators like Veritasium, thank you as well.", "comment_date": "2013-12-28T17:50:03Z", "likes_count": 81}, {"comment_by": "Vince B", "comment_text": "Why did he even have to say that a pencil does not contain lead?
