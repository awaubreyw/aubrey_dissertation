My beef is with the video of the spark.    It was probably done for better visual effects but the arc was high voltage AC current and not DC.   It is obvious from the wider and sustained plasma channel.   Of course the special effects of the humming of the arc also corresponds to 60 Hz AC.     Maybe I am being too much of a purist since it is a Hollywood production but since you went through all of the trouble to build the contraption, you could have at least showed the momentary jagged sparks that would fire intermittently between the discharge spheres.
