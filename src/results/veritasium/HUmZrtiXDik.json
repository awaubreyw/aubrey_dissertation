I made couple of calculations and here&#39;s what i got.\r<br>So let&#39;s say the fluid is water. From now on I am gonna use SI units of measure only because I am european, sorry if that bothers you lol. Anyways, to calculate the max height we can use the generalized version of Bernoulli equation: p1+0.5(density)*v1^2+(specific weight)*h1= p2+0.5(density)*v2^2+(specific weight)*h2+(specif weight)*hl, where hl is the head loss due to viscous effects. Let&#39;s say that water is moving with constant speed at 0,6 m/s (in the video the guy has made the fluid reach him after 10 seconds with a 6m long tube, so seems like a reasonable assumption). We can express the hl in terms of the friction factor: hl= f*0.5*V^2*h*(1/g*D), where D is the diameter (I used D=5mm). Now if we consider that initially the fluid has 0 velocity, 0 height and 0  gauge pressure, we can easily apply Bernoulli with losses. First we need to calculate f. I used the Colebrook correlation considering plastic as hydraulically smooth, to find f = 0.05. Last thing we need to set a minimum preassure, which would be the one at which cavitation occurs. For 25C, pmin= 3170 Pa so a gauge preassure of  -98130 Pa. Now we can solve Bernoulli and find hmax=9m.\r<br>Hope you enjoyed and let me know if you think something&#39;s wrong!!!", "comment_date": "2020-06-18T07:22:17Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Ankit Ravi", "comment_text": "Paradox <br>You failed to suck it mean u sucks at sucking and now u rock \ud83d\udcaa.

The means a perfect vacuum is impossible so the pressure difference will be less than assumed in this video. Water has a vapor pressure of 2.4kPa so its theoretical maximum height would be a function of (atmospheric pressure - max(vapor pressure,  applied pressure))*g*h.<br>It only makes a few % of difference with water but for some liquids it&#39;s a pretty massive limiting factor.<br>So fun video though!", "comment_date": "2019-03-15T15:03:16Z", "likes_count": 425}, {"comment_by": "I love burritos Mexicano", "comment_text": "They don\u2019t hold this record", "comment_date": "2019-03-15T05:18:05Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Choapse", "comment_text": "<b>S U C C</b>", "comment_date": "2019-03-15T03:38:09Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Asureshwar", "comment_text": "U make me horny and Nigel makes me go kinky", "comment_date": "2019-03-15T00:49:31Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "LiangLiang Xu", "comment_text": "They both looked high af", "comment_date": "2019-03-14T22:19:34Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Kellen", "comment_text": "Who else got that strange feeling in their mouth", "comment_date": "2019-03-14T17:24:21Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "SaiKouNEXO", "comment_text": "What a good sucker!", "comment_date": "2019-03-14T12:56:04Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Electraboss", "comment_text": "2019 anyone?", "comment_date": "2019-03-14T11:47:18Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "AINUN", "comment_text": "And so the tennis games were left alone...", "comment_date": "2019-03-14T10:59:59Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Leo Halford", "comment_text": "Who tf drinks Coke from a bottle with a straw??", "comment_date": "2019-03-14T07:33:19Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "pingu", "comment_text": "Nigel is trying to suck", "comment_date": "2019-03-14T06:36:29Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Bruh", "comment_text": "S u c c", "comment_date": "2019-03-14T05:24:38Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Michigan Mitten", "comment_text": "Ban this video plastic straws are no longer legal", "comment_date": "2019-03-14T04:36:55Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Uncleogee", "comment_text": "Just some dudes succing on some straws", "comment_date": "2019-03-14T04:30:13Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Kay '", "comment_text": "Succ", "comment_date": "2019-03-14T02:29:36Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "DusTyBoi", "comment_text": "<b>length straw</b>", "comment_date": "2019-03-14T02:09:30Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "#Amateur-Madman", "comment_text": "Tell Nigel that I\u2019m also Nigel", "comment_date": "2019-03-14T00:20:39Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "ivan pena", "comment_text": "I thought yall just wanted to suckanyways  from downstair godamn why are yall drinking  cokes with  straws \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02", "comment_date": "2019-03-13T19:35:40Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Hema Hingorani", "comment_text": "This is so much work", "comment_date": "2019-03-13T18:42:04Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Bohica", "comment_text": "A guy def did a mile long straw a while back", "comment_date": "2019-03-13T17:44:04Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Dienzer", "comment_text": "All these ppl in the comments making short puns on sucking", "comment_date": "2019-03-13T16:27:11Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Sukirat Singh Grewal", "comment_text": "This sucks.

The speed and intensity at which this negative pressure is kept, and it&#39;s magnitude, determine how quickly the liquid will go up the straw. That&#39;s how a straw works. It&#39;s the same physics used to understand the lungs, because basically that&#39;s how our lungs also work. We create a negative pressure in our lungs when we inhale (expanding the lungs), which causes air on the outside, which is at atmospheric pressure, to get sucked into your lungs.

The smaller the inside diameter of the tube the easier and higher you can pull it with the same amount of vacuum. Water flows 900 times faster through a nano-tube than it will through your kitchen plumbing(ted talk-the weirdness of water may be the answer).  In a garden hose the capillary action will cause the water to rise up the wall of the hose, about a millimeter or two at normal atmospheric pressure. But in a wine vinometer ( about a 1 mm diameter tube) the water will rise about 10-15 mm. In a redwood tree the capillaries are about a molecule in diameter and water will rise over 300&#39; up, but that in part may be due to the restructuring of water as well.  That is hundreds of feet higher than the theoretical maximum height a vacuum  can raise a liquid.

I&#39;m not too hot on physics, but I just wanted to point out that sucking through a normal size/length straw doesn&#39;t use your lungs or diaphragm, but instead relies on the air pressure in the length of the straw being decreased by increasing the volume of space in your mouth alone. You start with a relatively closed space with your lips creating a seal around the straw at the front of your mouth and the body of your tongue pushed to the roof of your mouth, cheeks close. Sucking begins when the tongue draws down from the roof of the mouth, making the oral space slightly bigger, (a larger volume to fill which lowers the pressure and causes a pressure gradient which the liquid moves to fill? - correct me if I&#39;m wrong). You can test this by sucking liquid up a normal straw whilst breathing through your nose still. If you were creating the pressure gradient with your lungs by moving your diaphragm down, you wouldn&#39;t be able to breathe through your nose because your throat would have blocked the airway to allow for a pressure gradient to build. Also, you would very quickly have fluid in your lungs - once the air runs out you&#39;d just be breathing in water! With your plastic tubing, I don&#39;t know if you were doing differently and taking full breaths with your diaphragm because you had considerably more air to shift in the tube and considerably less chance of filling your lungs with water!", "comment_date": "2015-06-18T07:10:51Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Daniel Lowe", "comment_text": "Its not a fair test.

There are manyy places on earth that humans regularly are found that are below sea level.\u00a0 Tau Tona gold mine in South Africa is 3.9 kilometers deep and provides a good example of why 10.3 meters is probably a little short of the maximum theoretical as well as practical limit to drinking from a straw.\u00a0\u00a0 Atmospheric pressure there should be well above 150 KPa.\u00a0<br>.<br>The third thing that seems worth mentioning is that the calculations of height attainable assume steady state.\u00a0 Drinking from a straw is not a matter of holding liquid at a given level.\u00a0 If a very low pressure is drawn initially and held, when the water reaches the point it would eventually settle at in steady state, it will not simply stop there.\u00a0 It will overshoot, and depending on things like how long the straw is, the shape and smoothness, how quickly the pressure difference was created and how large the pressure difference is, as well as the density and viscosity of the water or water mixture is, the overshoot could lead to liquid reaching a much greater height than what calculation that neglect the dynamic qualities suggest would be the maximum.<br>.<br>Capillary action\u00a0 would be another consideration, but I&#39;m not certain if this would be able to assist drinking or not.", "comment_date": "2014-06-28T04:48:55Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Martin Solberg", "comment_text": "But this would be the maximum a human could do right?<br><br>Instead of using a mouth and lungs.

Capillary action is what allows trees and plants to grow taller than 10.3m. the equation for capillary action is h=2*gamma*cosTheta/(rho*g*r) where h is the height difference between the cup water level, and the straw water level. Obviously as the radius gets smaller, the h gets larger. Theoretically Nigel could suck to an infinite height, with an infinitely small diameter straw.
