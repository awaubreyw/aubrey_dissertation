Objects lower in altitude accelerate toward the ground at a greater rate than those higher up by the ratio of the squares of their distances from the center of the attracting mass. So wouldn\u2019t someone in a very long windowless elevator falling toward the ground of an atmosphere-less planet see a free floating object that is closer to the floor of the elevator than the observer (and thus at an incrementally lesser altitude) see that object drift away from him toward the floor of the elevator since it is accelerating downward at a greater rate than he is?

People were thinking of &quot;the force of gravity&quot; which can be seen as interacting with atoms or baryons not with &quot;balls&quot;. A heavier ball doesn&#39;t accelerate slower because it has more inertia from this perspective. If you vaporized both balls into their constituent molecules, all of those molecules would accelerate at 9.8m/s/s at the geoid gravitational isosurface, whether they&#39;re all in a lump, or in a cloud. Gravity is acting on both balls in exactly the same way, and it is acting simply on &quot;mass&quot;, not on an aggregate with more or less mass, more or less inertia. <br><br>If you have a group of 10 runners on a starting line, and a group of 100 runners on another starting line, both masses will accelerate about the same when the gun goes off. The hundred runners will certainly produce more force considered en masse, but their acceleration rate can&#39;t be attributed to &quot;greater inertia&quot;. Each runner is accelerating at his own unit force/acceleration rate and the average inertia of the group isn&#39;t relevant.<br><br>Gravity can be considered as a point force acting on an object, like a spring-driven piston.

People were confused, because it&#39;s a confusing, albeit useful and practical, model. If you simply asked &quot;If both balls accelerate at the same rate when pushed across the ground, which will require the greater force?&quot; and of course everyone will nail it. But when you phrase it in terms of &quot;gravitational force&quot; it isn&#39;t actually quite the same thing. People fell into the hole between the approximation useful for calculation, and the more obscure reality. They knew that gravity was a constant, but they didn&#39;t know quite how to consider the force produced by the interaction of &quot;a mass&quot; - which is a notional entity - and the acceleration of gravity. <br><br>&quot;The force is greater, but so is the inertia&quot; can be rattled off fairly smugly.

Typically this experiment is done with objects that have a contrast in weight with one another such as an orange and a rock. And we see the quite noticeable proportionality of force acting on an object in respect to the object&#39;s mass, making things accelerate at a constant rate. Now it doesn&#39;t take a physics major to acknowledge that things like wind resistance can cause different objects to have unique terminal velocities. But even in a vacuum, can we still say for sure that both objects are actually hitting at the same time, or for all intensive purposes, accelerating towards earth at the same rate? One thing I noticed is that, although the experiment always considers two objects of differing masses to one another, they are in retrospect all insignificantly tiny in comparison to the earth itself. This may not seem very startling, but consider a different set of objects in the same experiment. What if we used something MUCH bigger, like the moon and an orange for example? Suppose, that we have an earth, vacant of atmosphere so we aren&#39;t worrying ourselves about friction, and we can for all intensive purposes, spontaneously create both an orange and a moon, both equal distance from the center of the earth, and record the results. Now besides the moon and earth colliding with one another, causing untold catastrophes that I&#39;m sure could be described in great detail for hours, would the two objects actually fall towards the earth at the same acceleration and velocities? Remember that all physical bodies have a gravitational force which, from our current understanding of physics, reaches infinitely to all other mass in the universe. Even the smallest and lightest objects still have a gravitational pull, they are simply so insignificantly tiny that they are quite literally unmeasurable with our given level of technology. But does that truly make them non-existent? We know that the moon does in fact pull on the earth a noticeable amount, causing tides to rise and fall, and our orbit to actually wobble. So if they were to in fact be in free fall towards one another, would there be the same level of acceleration for that set period of time? the magnitude of the acceleration that one body causes on another is the mass of the gravitating body divided by the distance between those two centers of mass squared (g = M/d^2). So acceleration caused by an object has nothing to do with the mass of the object its pulling on. However, since the other object is also causing an acceleration of its own, then the two objects accelerating towards one another give one greater net acceleration. And typically, this discrepancy would be unmeasurable since, we can&#39;t measure the acceleration of gravity caused by rocks and oranges on planetary bodies. But again, does this make it non-existent? So if the moon and orange were dropped at the same time, would they actually collide at the same time? Assuming they were dropped on the same side, or at least as close as possible considering how wide the moon is in relation, the fact that their respective vectors would be quite similar, they would both be causing the earth to accelerate towards them in one summation. But if we dropped them at opposite sides of the earth, I think it would be quite easy to see why they may not in fact collide at the same time. So as impractical as it may be to consider, the idea that acceleration on two objects dropped from the same height towards a gravity well will be the same, is as I stated before, a mere mechanical practicality, and not an absolute truth. Yes the acceleration caused by earth will be the same, but the net acceleration between the two bodies will most definitely be different.", "comment_date": "2015-02-19T11:46:57Z", "likes_count": 3}, {"comment_by": "anna", "comment_text": "This helped a lot, thanks haha", "comment_date": "2015-02-16T07:52:11Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Dragan Cosic", "comment_text": "for me that means all about gravity is BS(Beyond Sense) theres no gravity force at all just inertia", "comment_date": "2015-02-06T14:49:30Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Symbiotic Coherence", "comment_text": "ahh, why haven&#39;t they asked me??<br>well i know it is because i wasn&#39;t there, but still i kind of feel ashamed for that low level of education<br>and by the way, isn&#39;t it obvious, that that heavier ball needs more force to hold it up against gravitation?", "comment_date": "2015-02-05T21:13:43Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "TheGuardian163", "comment_text": "Why am I at an advantage when running downhill against a light opponent (even though I am larger) and at a disadvantage running uphill against a light opponent?<br><br>I&#39;m sleepy so I probably just missed something and asked something dumb because of it, but I&#39;m still asking.
