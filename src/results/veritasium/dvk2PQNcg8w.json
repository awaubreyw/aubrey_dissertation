This was followed by a strong drop in the quality of knowledge, both in physics and in everything in general, especially in political sciences. All this was due to the economic growth that started in the late 18th century, which in the 19th century, moved to the growth of global economies. Then, all this collapsed at the beginning of the 20th century, after which, until the 70s, it began to rise again both in physics and in general. After the 80s, global economic growth started again, driven by financial expansions and corresponding incentives. This was followed by the invention of computers, then the Internet, and the rapid growth of information flows. Quite naturally, the quality of knowledge fell again both in physics and in everything in general, including, especially, in political sciences. This phenomenon has its own regularities, which can be illustrated by the following simple example: let&#39;s say we have two groups of 100 people who have no communication with each other and are approximately at the same stage of development. Each group will be structured into smart people, people with average data, and people with less than average data. A certain life balance will be established in the society of both groups, in which these three types of people balance each other. If we combine these two groups into one common globalized group, very soon it will turn out that the number of fools will be more than what should be produced by simple assembly, and this will happen at the expense of people with average data, because twice as many &quot;fakes&quot; can produce three times as many people as this. It was done in separate groups. If you add hundreds more to these 200 people, the situation becomes even worse, and although the number of smart people increases proportionally, their influence in society will decrease. Accordingly, a new equilibrium is formed, which led to two world wars in the first half of the 20th century.

Great video. You mentioned confirmation bias, and that is a kind of filter system that you could say prevents us from ever hearing the &#39;alternative view&#39;. When we do see the alternative view, another human trait is our discomfort and rejection response to those alternative views. Cognitive dissonance and the backfire effect. I&#39;m not a psychologist, although I learned about these phenomena in my studies in aviation safety, and I understand that these are powerful responses to overcome. Like your response to car manufacturing emissions. It would be great to see a video by you about this, as I think it is more important now than almost any other topic out there. Even the climate crisis is dependent on mass agreement and collaboration (and facts, not feelings and opinions). Also, on the topic of bridging the divide, there&#39;s a great video by Dr Craig Malkin where he talks about whether Donald Trump is narcissistic / has NPD. In it he talks about what he thinks is key to overcoming divides between, as he put it, the red hats and the pinks hats. His answer is for us all to look under the hat at the individual person, as we&#39;re not so different in most cases. A simple and, to some people, a romantic idea, but I think he&#39;s right. All we need now is to find a way to integrate these ideas into social media algorithms, communications regulations, and to decouple media and social media from the major news agencies, such as those owned by Rupert Murdoch, who rely on our human reactions to populist news to make money.

I have fact-checked the &quot;fact checkers&quot; in a few occasions, and it turned out that their facts actually aren&#39;t facts at all. One of the most impressive was them denying a video of a University professor directly involved in a matter that he discusses about in the video. He was presented in the video with his name, his title, and the University he works for. Fact checkers denied what he was saying about a matter he is obviously an expert in, and also directly involved, recalling on a news report from a news agency that stated something opposite was told by &quot;university scientists&quot;. Now, the big problem here is that they never named a single scientist or the university he or she works for (neither the news agency, or the &quot;fact checkers&quot;). So Facebook simply takes their &quot;fact checkers&quot; for granted even though they don&#39;t have any relevant facts, or at least their &quot;facts&quot; aren&#39;t supported in any way and with practically no background, while the &quot;fake&quot; article shows the person, the name, and the institution. So, if you ask me, Facebook trying to improve the quality of the content, they actually managed to mess it up and make it worse than ever before. It seems to me that they&#39;re doing this on purpose, they take sides and now promote their side as always right, covering/hiding behind the &quot;war on fake news&quot;.

I think the root of the described problem is much more fundamental. Being determines consciousness. Society is only a derivative of the economy. Our economy is capitalist, and all processes are dictated by capitalist relations. We can unwind the tangle from the end. You said that the Internet is controlled by algorithms. Who came up with these algorithms? All major information portals, social networks, and services are in private hands. They are run by companies and corporations. Why did they come up with such algorithms? Because companies and corporations are aimed at making a profit, or rather at maximizing profits. All their decisions are aimed at achieving this goal, and few people care about all the other consequences. Very often these consequences are deplorable. For example, everyone knows that there is an abnormally high amount of sugar in the diet of a modern person. It&#39;s killing us. But evolution has made it so that we all love sugar, because sweet means a lot of energy, a lot of energy means I will survive. And our brain rewards us for consuming sugar with emissions of happiness hormones. Grocery companies realized this and started adding sugar to absolutely everything. No one thought about what consequences it would lead to, everyone knew that it would increase sales, and the rest was collateral damage. You can call them crooks who exploit a person&#39;s weaknesses, or you can call them successful entrepreneurs who find the most profitable solution. In the field of the Internet, everything is the same. Companies have realized that people don&#39;t like to be wrong, like to make fun of someone else&#39;s opinion, like to argue, and they use these human weaknesses in their algorithms to increase activity and, as a result, income. You can try to persuade the owners to change the algorithms, make restrictions and amendments to them that would be aimed at spreading the truth so that people argue and dissociate less. But from the point of view of a capitalist, you will be asked to spend a lot of money on algorithms that will worsen activity and reduce profits. I&#39;m afraid no one will listen to you, and if you are persistent, they will most likely be called a communist trying to restrict the free market.", "comment_date": "2022-08-18T19:13:23Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "I C", "comment_text": "This idea of convergence and unity of thought always gives me red flags.

The fight for what is true is not new in history, and there are plenty of possible explanations for why this idea of fake news or facts appears to be an increasing trend now. Maybe there are just more people and the quality of facts today makes the weaker ideas more visible and thus more defensive as they are always under siege by more educated facts. Possibly combined with a cycle of reactionary people as we have had a period of globalism and fact sharing, so we now have a period of nationalism and an attitude of &quot;fact&quot; ownership. This is not new, the early inquisitions could be regarded as a tool to deal with the same problem, a way to separate the false facts or news from what at that time was considered proper facts. Lying or falsifying linage is in history considered immoral and a pretty big deal, likely due to false facts being an issue. So instead of the current &quot;fake news era&quot; being a period of novelty it might be the norm, perhaps the objectivity and &quot;fact&quot; ideal of the last century is the exception, or as I hinted on earlier a conjuncture of history that soon will get back in fashion. Did not Germany in the 1920s and 30s have the same issue, did not Soviet have their alternate truths, what about the Spanish Americas where a trial was held to decide on what was true as for the humanity of the natives. Much of the fact oriented era of the last close to 100 years can be ascribed to the UN system and the International organization of standardization (IOS). Everything move to steps forward, now we have the reaction of one step back, then we likely will be taking two steps forward again as we always have. Main reason why we perceive this as a novelty is maybe due to people living today not having experienced the time before the 1950s. Or the revolutions and counter-revolutions of ages past, of ideological schisms and so on.

But, consider NPR. Their slogan is \u201cFact Based Journalism.\u201d And when they want to close some source down they add the tag, \u201cwithout evidence.\u201d <br>But I listen to NPR everyday. And yes, every story they tell has facts. Rarely does an NPR report tell an outright lie. But in the recent trial of Kyle Rittenhouse the Sunday morning reporter included this statement, \u201ca nearly all white jury\u201d when she described the 12 men snd women who, unanimously, found Kyle Rittenhouse not guilty of all charges of which he had been accused. (And not just the formal charges in the initial indictment, but lesser charges that were, towards the end of the trial, given as alternatives to the original charges, because, likely, the DA knew he hadn\u2019t made the case for his original very serious charges.)<br>Back to the NPR storyteller. Where did she obtain the facts (or even one single fact) on which her statement \u201cmostly white jury\u201d was based? In fact, no one knows the race of any of the jurors because the race of the prospective jurors was never asked. It was not asked in the written questions, and it was not asked by any of the lawyers. Additionally, the court did not publish any statement about the racial make up of the jury. Yet, in spite of having no facts to support the claim, the NPR story teller said Kyle Rittenhouse\u2019s jury was \u201cmostly all white.\u201d Fact based journalism? No, in this case it is perception based journalism. Nothing more. And in fact, the storyteller never mentions she has no facts on which she based that statement. She states it as fact, when in fact it is a guess at best. <br><br>It might have been she personally interviewed each juror in private and asked the question about their race. Their individual answers might have been the facts in which she based her statement. But she didn\u2019t do that. How do I know? She does not state that she has based her statement on any interview. And that\u2019s a fact. <br><br>Moreover, there is not a single day that I can\u2019t find a case where an NPR story isn\u2019t based on selective facts. Yes, it might be a fact that Kyle Rittenhouse was carrying an AR-15, but it\u2019s not a fact that he crossed state lines with that rifle. It might be a fact that Kyle Rittenhouse was carrying an AR-15, but it\u2019s also a fact that the version he had, because of its barrel length, was not illegal for him to carry in public. It might be a fact that Kyle Rittenhouse lived in Illinois with his mom, but it is also a fact that his dad lived in Kenosha, WI and Kyle also lived there with him. It is a fact that Kyle had a life guarding job in Kenosha. So at some point in time, yes, it is a fact that Kyle Rittenhouse crossed the state line between Illinois and Wisconsin. But so what? The fact is, there isn\u2019t an NPR storyteller who doesn\u2019t want borders torn down and opened up, so why should the fact that Kyle ever went from Illinois to Wisconsin, or vice versa, matter at all? <br><br>Then look at Waukesha. Yes, it is a fact that there was a car crash (CNN, NBC, ABC, CBS, Time, to name a few called it a \u201cparade crash). But really? Is that all that it was? Just a little \u201coopsy daisy,\u201d accident? Is that the fact that is important? Hell, no! The fact is the driver swerved across the width of the road intending to hit marchers in the parade. That fact is purposefully omitted. A full week after the assault on Waukesha\u2019s streets CNN write this:<br>\u201cWaukesha will hold a moment of silence todav, marking one week since a car drove through a Christmas parade, killing six and injuring scores more.\u201d You might take issue with the fact \u201ca car drive through.\u201d Cars don\u2019t drive themselves. There must have been a driver. But that semantic anomaly aside everything else is factually correct. But it hardly states the real crux of the story. The driver (yes, there was one), to the mind of your average viewer was intentional in his effort to run people down. And he ran them down from their back. Some were playing musics instruments, so they would not have even heard the vehicle\u2019s approach. <br>Facts are good. They are essential to real understanding.

Truth is interpretation that belief is better than disbelief. Now I&#39;m a mathematician so this may come across as weird, but even when trying to prove the most abstract statements in the most logical way, in the end everything begins with axioms that we choose to believe or not, and deduction is just a way to expanding the reach of your beliefs in a way that avoids contradiction within your own beliefs. But &quot;absolute truth&quot; would imply that there are statements that you cannot assume to be false, and that is probably one of the weirdest things to assume, i.e. that absolute truth exists. <br><br>I am not saying this to say we should all give up on objective truths; there are some beliefs that we obviously all profit from commonly believing such as science (the belief that experiments of the past that can be repeated are an indicator of what we should believe to be true regardless of our other beliefs for survival, happiness, etc.) or mathematics (the belief that believing things to be true based on a super minimal set of beliefs and pure deduction will lead us to statements we should also believe for survival, happiness, etc.), but for a very long time big chunks of humanity had very strong common beliefs that had nothing to do with science (religions, weird treatment methods in archaic &quot;medicine&quot;...), so we can&#39;t just dismiss that.

In some sense it&#39;s what the Google &amp; Facebook algorithms are doing, and it&#39;s what the video is suggesting as well: how do we digest all that we know about the world and cram it into people heads through the screens they use to look at it so that we adjust our beliefs in an optimal way?

Social media looks to find ALL the influencers and give them power to drive revenue.  However, just being an influencers is not an indicator of someone that can build broad consensus, but often just someone that can polarize people to an idea, whether common good or divisive extreme.  \r<br>\r<br><br>The algorithm should promote indicators of &quot;broad consensus&quot;, not divergence.  We should still have influencers, but it should be those that can build broad consensus, not polarized sound bites. \r<br>\r<br><br>The algorithm we should strive for should apply &#39;quality of argument&#39; to the content and amplify converging not diverging positions.  Machine Learning can already identify facts over fiction.  Elevate comments with higher quality of argument.  If people see strong quality argument vs just fact-less retorts we would likely see better debate and greater consensus, not 100%, but better than now.  External echo chambers are a huge factor, but I won&#39;t go there. \r<br>\r<br><br>Another key consideration is power.  Consolidated power from a large mob of users or power from someone that has influence over the person dilutes the value of the response, not necessarily the credibility or factuality.  One person says X and 100 people pile on, doesn&#39;t mean that X is valid or valuable.  Like buttons are over simplified, there should be many ways to promote and demote comments.  Imagine if you could demote comments like you promote comments. \r<br>\r<br><br>Social media platforms learn the personality type of users from their content and likes.  Each personality type is influenced differently, so people that tend to go with their gut, instinct or emotion, especially fear, are much more likely to be influenced by social media.

It wouldn&#39;t force it all to be impersonal - look at early days of social media, you can still do what was done there. Users have said who their friends are, they&#39;ve said what topics and organisations they are interested in. These are explicit choices that can be used to feed content.

On the up side it doesn&#39;t require any &quot;is this true&quot; calculation or similar which I think will not be workable.

Simply put they fear death and have a HEALTHY survival instinct to preserve the life of their opinions/identity/ego. And weirdly turning this idea on its head and saying that truth tellers are stuck to their egos, this argument can immediately be used against truthers in the land of fake news.<br><br>People don&#39;t realize how much they are not actually they&#39;re ego and identity. And just now, I&#39;ve thought the way to get around all of this (being stuck believing things aren&#39;t true) and to eventually teach people out of fake news is to focus on training/teaching/coaching (etc...) that let&#39;s them know they are not they&#39;re ego, that there is some fundamental part of them which is much more permanent, beautiful and immutable (I would say a soul).

Yet, while they seemed intensely venemous in their biased assault on Trump and questionable in integrity to those supporting Trump, the same seemed true across much of the television networks including all the major ones other than Fox.  Fox was bought and started to join in the bias with the exception of a few Trump supporters Fox could not afford to lose at the time.  So, while Newsmax and other news sources formed, people started turning to social media to get the news directly from those streaming videos from their cell phones, and people began getting and sharing the news faster than the media could release their rendition of it.<br><br>However, with liberty came news of a different flavor.  No longer were people restricted to hearing only the leftist perspective from CNN and MSNBC.  Now they could choose who to listen to.  Trump began posting on Facebook and Twitter and the tyrants on the left could not tolerate this, so Twitter and Facebook cut off the right of the American people to hear from their elected President on those platforms.<br><br>So, it appears Zuckerberg and Dorsey felt they had a right to assume the role of dictators as did the leadership of CNN and other media networks who amazingly produced warnings identical, verbatim, in content in short order showing damning evidence of a single source of &quot;information&quot;--warnings about so-called &quot;disinformation&quot; or &quot;misinformation&quot;.<br><br>Cut off from the public, Trump went to Parler and the people went to Parler to hear what he had to say.  Parler respected this freedom of press and freedom of speech.  But Apple and Google removed the Parler app from their mobile application stores and AWS removed Parler&#39;s website as it resided on Amazon&#39;s machines.<br><br>I really don&#39;t believe the left is concerned at all about fake news or faulty information or so-called &quot;lies&quot;.  Many people think they are only concerned about information they don&#39;t want to allow people to hear.  They can lie about Clarence Thomas and Brett Kavanaugh to keep them off the Supreme Court bench.  They can lie about Trump, lie about his words, take whatever he says out of context, and falsely accuse him to keep him out of office.  And then when he finishes his term having done an absolutely stellar job, they can rise up and bray out the most asinine, gaslighting, intelligence-insulting abuses.  And when even that does not get the people to vote him out of office, well, they can simply extend their cheating in every possible way doing whatever it takes to get a crazy, inept, dangerous, half-witted, bumbling jerk into office even if it means getting double-votes, discarding legitimate votes, double counting votes, and cheating in such an obvious way that nobody with both a brain and an ounce of integrity could deny that the cheating was grotesque.<br><br>And it&#39;s all dismissed as fake news.<br><br>If there were riots on January 6, it would be well deserved.  But the conservatives are not like the leftists who rioted and took over parts of cities or burned down black businesses in the name of Black Lives Matter.  Nor are they like Antifa who beat up the elderly, the women, and the children in the street like a bunch of terrorist hoodlums--cowards.  They tore down statues.  When they could not make their case, they resorted to violence and name-calling, calling people racists in particular.<br><br>When people on the left say they want to eliminate fake news, I don&#39;t think they want to eliminate it at all, but rather they want to promote fake news or anything that will further their agenda.<br><br>So, are we polarized?  You bet.  What happened elsewhere when leftists tried to take over?  What happened in North Korea?  China?  Russia?  Vietnam?  Cambodia?  If the Communists or Socialists killed off millions to constrain the truth from being told and to obtain absolute control over what people were allowed to say, think, feel, believe, then what special kind of stupidity would it take for someone to believe they would not do the exact same thing in America or anywhere else today?<br><br>The only unity we need at this point is the unity necessary to eliminate this totalitarianism, this arrogant abuse and violence and injustice and robbery of the rights of ordinary citizens to choose for ourselves what we will say, what we will believe, what we will speak and write.<br><br>Most of us pledged our allegiance to a flag and its nation, and it&#39;s time we live up to that pledge.  It&#39;s time we refuse to ask permission or seek approval to think what we will, to say what we will, to hear and see what we will, and to believe what we will.<br><br>And if that means making sure we don&#39;t live like stupid sitting ducks throwing away our weapons while we are violated by the lying and tyrannical criminals who want to kill or violate our freedom and destroy our nation, then it is imperative that we get prepared and stay prepared to defend our nation, our neighbors, our families, our principles, our rights, and our liberty from those who would take it from us.<br><br>It is disappointing to find we may have to choose once again whether to succumb to the abuses of another George III in this day or whether to resist at great cost.  But if we lay down in submission to our tyrants we will be irresponsible and reprehensible and cowardly fools and we will desecrate the soil of those at rest in Arlington and other places where brave Americans died for our freedom.<br><br>So, don&#39;t tell me what I can and cannot say, think, hear, and believe.  Don&#39;t prescribe for me what so-called &quot;truth&quot; I will be allowed to hear and believe and say.  It is one thing to outlaw the planning of violent and illegal activity or to outlaw truly damaging defamation of character, and frankly, I am not sure if we even do that good of a job of this compared to how well our people rise up and demand the silencing of opinions and grievances truly protected by the Constitution.<br><br>Our Declaration of Independence was not a call to war or a call to offensive and violent action.  The reaction of George III of England was.  And the war that ensued was made necessary by the bloodshed initiated by England with their massacres and acts of violence and violation of our people&#39;s rights.  Our declaration was to notify them of our decision to separate from England, and it was made honorably for good reason.  It was not a willy-nilly throwing off of legitimate authority but a decision to remove ourselves from control of a tyrant who ruled without accountability.  Our nation&#39;s choice was for a government of, for, and by the people and not of, the people for and by a tyrant with taxation without representation, with making of laws from outside this body of people.  It was time to throw off an evil rulership in favor of an ethical and fair one in the interest of the well-being of all the people.<br><br>Communism and Socialism pretended to do likewise, and what happened?  Perhaps hundreds of millions killed.  More millions grieved their losses deeply.  Other millions starved or suffered torture.  And that experiment was repeated, and every time it claimed to be &quot;something different&quot; and every time it produced the same horrible results.  And yet here we are again with people fighting for the right to be tyrants over someone else like a bunch of murderous arrogant jerks.  And it&#39;s time we grow up and get past this.  It&#39;s time we let others think, feel, and decide for themselves what they will believe.<br><br>We don&#39;t need any tyrants to do that for us.", "comment_date": "2021-08-22T22:24:11Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Kaldrin", "comment_text": "And then even among infos that weren&#39;t posted to be fake news there can be a lot of wrong ones and on many subjects even by searching and thinking it becomes really hard to tell which side is right or wrong, what is true and what isn&#39;t", "comment_date": "2021-08-22T21:39:45Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Barry Day", "comment_text": "&quot;I think you know CNN is more likely to be true than Breitbart News.&quot;<br><br>That statement didn&#39;t age very well....", "comment_date": "2021-08-22T20:11:55Z", "likes_count": 2}, {"comment_by": "klankungen", "comment_text": "10 seconds in and I lost my focus for what he said by the fact that he is where I am right now \ud83d\ude31", "comment_date": "2021-08-22T19:18:55Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "sgt0pimienta", "comment_text": "Dude you&#39;ve got it wrong.

Some are deluded into thinking we can eliminate risk all together, others have no empathy at all. But the few who acknowledge there must be a balance are chastised by both factions.

The idea of a fact is in itself a fictional construct as well as we do not as human beings have the ability to observe, let alone take into account all variables and arrive at definitive conclusions. We invented the idea of a fact to cope with our fear of the unknown. We delude ourselves into knowing things we do not. The ailment society is facing is mass cognitive dissonance. Even objective people can encounter contradictory information and not know how to handle it. The more information that is available, the less likely an objective mind is to arrive at a conclusion. There are 100s of other paradoxes, but I don&#39;t have time to list them all.<br><br>The paradox that is causing the most problems right now is the idea of forced diversity. The idea of a global &quot;melting pot&quot; is the reason civilization is melting. You say &quot;why cant we all agree on what to consider factual information&quot; The answer is simple. The more diverse the opinions, the less likely a society is to arrive at a consensus. The more diversity in a society, the more factions. Now that we are dealing with a mass consciousness like never before seen, there are literally an  infinite number of contradictory ideas considered factual. People are not going to magically come together and agree to think one way under one set of rules. There is no algorithm that can make that happen. It will only ever happen by force. Which is why it should not happen. People need to be allowed to form their groups and live the way they want and believe the way they want without outside interference. I&#39;m not implying that diversity is in itself bad, just that there can be too much of a good thing. People need an escape. We need diversity in the form of factions where people can find like minded individuals and not feel threatened by other factions trying to change the way they think.

Doctor said, keep taking it, it&#39;ll work eventually. The man ended up in the Emergency room with AF so bad, he thought his heart was going to blow up. \r<br>\r<br>They hooked him up to the monitors and several docs and nurses came in to observe. They gave the man intravenous something but it didn&#39;t work, it got worse. The Doc said to the nurse, give him another. It still didn&#39;t work and they said it was spilling over into other chambers of his heart.  The man was asked if he was in pain, the man said no. But then offered the information that Ativan sometimes would abort an attack. The nurse gave the man two and within a minute, the AF settled down. It was still happening but the pounding stopped. They kept the man overnight with a heart monitor on. By morning, after a good night&#39;s sleep, the AF was gone, but not for good. He kept getting attacks, 2 to 3 times a week that lasted 4 to 6 hours. . \r<br>\r<br>The man did some research on the subject and found out that indeed, Metoprolol could cause arrhythmia. So the man did more research and settled on magnesium supplements as a possible cure.  Most people have a deficiency in many nutrients, including magnesium. Magnesium is essential in hundreds of biological processes including, muscle contraction and nerve conduction. \r<br>\r<br>So the man tapered off the Metoprolol and also started to take magnesium in increasingly  higher doses. When he hit 2,000 milligrams, he found it made him TOO regular so he backed off to 1500 milligrams. Withing a month, his AF attacks gradually decreased in frequency until they stopped altogether.

Beau Lotto has an interesting point to make about that in his video called: &quot;The Neuroscience of Creativity, Perception, and Confirmation Bias | Beau Lotto | Big Think&quot;.<br>To ensure your survival, your brain evolved to avoid one thing: uncertainty. As neuroscientist Beau Lotto points out, if your ancestors wondered for too long whether that noise was a predator or not, you wouldn&#39;t be here right now. Our brains are geared to make fast assumptions, and questioning them in many cases quite literally equates to death. No wonder we&#39;re so hardwired for confirmation bias. No wonder we&#39;d rather stick to the status quo than risk the uncertainty of a better political model, a fairer financial system, or a healthier relationship pattern. But here&#39;s the catch: as our brains evolved toward certainty, we simultaneously evolved away from creativity\u2014that&#39;s no coincidence; creativity starts with a question, with uncertainty, not with a cut and dried answer. To be creative, we have to unlearn millions of years of evolution. Creativity asks us to do that which is hardest: to question our assumptions, to doubt what we believe to be true. That is the only way to see differently. And if you think creativity is a chaotic and wild force, think again, says Beau Lotto. It just looks that way from the outside. The brain cannot make great leaps, it can only move linearly through mental possibilities. When a creative person forges a connection between two things that are, to your mind, so far apart, that&#39;s a case of high-level logic. They have moved through steps that are invisible to you, perhaps because they are more open-minded and well-practiced in questioning their assumptions. Creativity, it seems, is another (highly sophisticated) form of logic.

One big one is to realize that manipulative capitalism is almost the norm. In general a salesman/woman or marketer is supposed to find the audience for a product/service and give them understanding of how useful the product is. But of course the motive is just to get it to sell with as little buyers remorse as possible. This means manipulation is the true key to success in such a role. To do this companies with the spare capital (the larger they are, usually the more spare cash to throw at the problem) push on the government to corrupt it and create artificial monopolies or, if they&#39;re smart, they spread misinformation. Convince the populace that a pair of shoes will make you run faster. It&#39;s not so good when a company convinces a large chunk of the population that their product is better than the competition based on false presumptions, but far worse is when an industry changes the culture to overvalue the industry and view it in the wrong way (*cough healthcare *cough cars *cough education *cough). This is done with massive quantities of money, government coordination and plenty of bought-out &quot;scientists&quot;; whatever helps transform the outlook.

Sociologists like Bruno Latour (ie: the books Laboratory Life and The Pasteurisation of France) and John Law explore the complex ways that facts become facts. They don&#39;t just exist waiting to be found, but are in part formed and maintained through social processes and through what Latour calls &#39;trials of strength&#39;. So for instance the anaerobic microbe can be called so because it survives without air (that&#39;s what anaerobic means) and this has been tested and agreed upon by enough people. What started as a theory is gradually stabilised into a fact through experimentation and a network of scientific papers that all support each other. Then it gets printed in thousands of textbooks that circulate the knowledge and it becomes uncontroversial. Understanding the process by which facts are formed and maintained can help us to understand and counter the formation of what Latour calls &#39;artefacts&#39; (which are formed through subjective psychological or localised processes), such as the information the anti-vax or flat earth movement is based on. Unfortunately the internet can brute force certain artefacts into things that vast communities interpret as facts using algorithms or drawing on humanity&#39;s capacity for rumour mongering to drive web traffic. As Veritasium says, its a difficult problem but one way out is to accept that facts aren&#39;t just absolute monolithic entities but are constructed through rule bound processes which could then be codified through algorithms.

China is a good example but Singapore is probably the better example and China even learned from the Singapore experience. If it\u2019s not forced, truth will eventually displace falsehoods but pockets of resistance will remain and these are people who depend on confirmation biases to hold on to their beliefs.

At the time of this video we were 8 years into president Obama&#39;s two terms. A president that shouted about unity ended up being the most divisive potus in nearly a century. As conservatives moved more centrist the progressive left moved further and further to its extreme end. Socialism and even communism was embraced as a real solution to economic issues despite more than a century and 200 million dead bodies. Racial discrimination which was legislated into the history bin of the American experience for the vast majority of people began to be portrayed as a systemiclly engrained problem that most people of color were being pushed down by. While it&#39;s true racism is real and all is us come to the table with bias especially in how we congregate with our peers privately, in our public and work life discrimination laws, exposure  and education have made the type of racial biases that could stop a person from achieving their goals less and less likely. <br><br>Instead what we&#39;ve been told to think is that we are born with some original sin debt that must be extracted from us if we are white in America. While our collective history is filled with racism and horrible acts of real racial violence and discriminatory conduct we have paid a tremendous price to pull this country out of that past history. Blood of 600,000 mostly white Americans flooded battlefield after battlefield during our civil war to end that ancient and common practice of slavery. Women were added to that struggle for equal opportunity and access in the beginning of the 20th  century. And of every color, stripe and background sacrificed more time, energy and even blood to usher in new civil rights laws that further closed these public barriers to economic, social and educational equality. <br><br>Now suddenly in 2012 we saw the beginnings of the &quot;America is  Irredeemable&quot; messaging begin to infiltrate universities and media. Every video of a black man in an altercation with police was burned into our consciousness by a news media that knew, while tragic that anyone would be harassed or even killed by those charged with protection of those who could not protect themselves, these are outliers in a country of 350 million people. And if you are a person of color in America you are safer here than nearly anywhere on the planet. And every metric  and statistic proves it to be fact. <br><br>How then at a time when we should be celebrating our remarkable success in moving in 150 years from a country where 80 percent of blacks were in bondage to a country of laws that moves  every day closer to realizing the ideal of our founding documents. Where more diversity of color, culture and religion exists and is nearly universally celebrated than any nation on earth. How can both things be true? Which America is real?<br><br><br>Is this my America where you can think what you think and I&#39;m free to think and say what I think?  <br><br>Or is this BLMs America? A place that&#39;s racism is so deeply rooted in its white citizens that we are doomed to oppress our neighbor forever?<br>In 2019 we exploded over the George Floyd killing in Detroit. Video played on a loop for weeks of his last moments alive with a police officer kneeling on his neck for 7 minutes. It was shocking and galvanizing. All Americans were outraged but soon BLM protests became more and more condemning of American culture and all whites.And since it was  &quot;systemic&quot; no proof was needed to paint me or my young daughter as an evil, flawed and irredeemable racist. Our only salvation was in begging for forgiveness, stepping aside for my black coworkers on work promotions or college admissions. Free health care, free college. An even larger and more costly social welfare safety net. <br><br>Then it&#39;s focus moved back to gay and lesbian oppression. NextTrans rights because they are even more oppressed. Then my speech is not just oppressive, it&#39;s violence. Safe spaces on campus and then at work were demanded. If you feel oppressed by them you must be. If you feel I&#39;m not your advocate then I&#39;m your enemy. You assign motive to my every breath and progressive power brokers monitor your social media life and give you strikes if you stray from the approved talking points. <br><br>Don&#39;t even start me on the lock downs and masks and vaccination policies. Whether by plan or miraculous accident these events were taken out of the context of their effect to divide us and isolate us. Make us dependent on the government and media&#39;s influencers. Young people are especially vulnerable to this lunacy. Was change needed in our collective feelings about race and power? We can always do better. Each of us. But are we living in dangerous times for poc? No! We were living in the safest, most free time in history and America is, as always at the forefront. <br><br>Social media is a divisive influence. You can be whatever you choose in America. Far from being your oppressor if you are black, most whites want you to be hugely successful. That&#39;s the freedom of America. There&#39;s plenty of success to go around. Yours doesn&#39;t harm mine. <br><br>The keys to attaining it are simple. Do the right thing. Don&#39;t do drugs. Don&#39;t get pregnant until you are married or financially independent. Graduate......again and again. Show up for work everyday and be productive. Do these simple things and you are all but guaranteed to live a life of safety and prosperity in America.

If alchemy were real and, with some magic spell, I could actually turn lead into gold and then started converting all the lead in the world to gold... the value of gold would drop like a rock. Indeed, if alchemy were real, then grab some of that lead and DON&#39;T convert it to gold. Because when there&#39;s no lead left - and gold is worthless for its over-abundance - then you&#39;ll be the rich man for having now-precious lead, which you can&#39;t find anywhere else anymore.<br><br>If gold were as abundant and easily obtained as sand on a beach then, well, it would be cost as much as sand.

So, as first editions are lost and destroyed over time, the value of, say, a mint condition first edition of Tolkien&#39;s Lord of the Rings just keeps going up in value.<br><br>And it&#39;s the old thing. People ask, if the government can print money, then why can&#39;t it just print a million dollars for everyone? Well, because this gargantuan money supply would still, ultimately, represent all the goods and labour that exists in the country. So if you have vastly more dollars representing the same things, then the value of each dollar is reduced accordingly. If everyone&#39;s rich, then no-one&#39;s rich. Printing money in vast quantities would only devalue the currency itself. You&#39;d have a million dollars... in a world where a dollar is now not even worth what a cent used to be worth. Indeed, you wouldn&#39;t make everyone rich, you&#39;d solely make rich people poor - because in a world where everyone has a million dollars, then having 50 million dollars isn&#39;t that much more impressive.<br><br>Supply versus demand economics.

But now that absolutely anyone can call up the answer on their phone through Google, the name of the world&#39;s tallest man - that fact - has been devalued.<br><br>When the only way to have a copy of the Bible in Medieval times was for a monk to pain-stakingly copy it by hand, their worth was immeasurable. Then Gutenberg worked out how to print them off in bulk with his modified wine press, and the value of a copy dropped. Then we have lithographic machines that can knock out copies faster than the eye can see, and the Gideons can leave free copies lying around in hotel rooms.<br><br>These days, with the Internet, I can indefinitely duplicate as many copies as I like of the Bible.

It&#39;s irrelevant how big or small demand is, because it can always be perfectly supplied (and, indeed, then all that&#39;s left with value is time, as copies cannot be made instantly - supply is not physically limited, it&#39;s solely temporally limited).<br><br>Have we, in fact, killed the value of the &quot;currency&quot; of facts through over-supply?<br><br>Yes, that&#39;s a weird concept.

I have liked your videos very much and have shared and recommended them. But you are very much out of your depth here! In general, I agree with your premise, but I believe you are very naive and influenced by your own very obvious confirmation bias! You speak of truth, but who&#39;s truth? Science is not agreement on truth by consensus! The truth and facts are independent of how many agree or accept them. You are working very hard to dance around what you mean by those who can see the truth and those who are &quot;post-truth.&quot; In short, you describe everyone who disagrees with you as being deluded by cognitive bias. You use the term &quot;fake news&quot; without a definition or giving real examples. You don&#39;t seem to allow that truth and fake news exist on both sides of a question. As well educated in physics as you are, you don&#39;t seem to have absorbed much from growing up around an engineer (as I also did), I was not surprised at all to learn about the huge amount of toxic products to produce lithium batteries and EVs. But I was I also understood that this new technology would mature and improve over time to solve problems with production, economy, and utility. Climate!? You just throw out that all intelligent people of good conscience should know the facts and agree about the monolithic topic &quot;Climate Change.&quot; In reality, Climate change is an immensely complicated topic with many areas to agree or disagree upon. Climate is a group of topics subject to the greatest polarization because of political ideas about what to do or not to do about it. Wikipedia! Well, yes, Wikipedia is useful if you are looking up science, engineering, or other topics with little emotional investment. But any listing about a specific person, their life, achievements, and beliefs is often taken with a grain of salt. There is definitely a left-ward bias against conservatives. Several conservatives I know of have had inaccurate things placed in their wiki entries (which I know to be untrue) and have been unable to have Wikipedia address those inaccuracies. I truly doubt you have actually compared the veracity of CNN over Breitbart news. I am sure that you and those you agree with will just take it on faith that CNN is journalism and Breitbart ain&#39;t. Well, I am old enough to know real journalism, and CNN ain&#39;t close. If you can&#39;t see that it is just as much a propaganda mouthpiece for your ideology as Breitbart is for those you believe are wrong, you should just stick to doing cool videos about quirky science things. I don&#39;t blame you. As you said, cognitive bias is part of being human. I used to teach my students; cognitive bias fundamentally defines humanness as manipulating fire, complex tool use, bipedalism or planning for the future. It is great that you are so well educated, intelligent, glib, and talented; but that is a huge trap (I have been there). You are young, and reaching a mastery and confidence in your profession. it is very easy to impress yourself as you go about impressing others. I didn&#39;t begin to control my cognitive bias until my late 40s; when I realized that higher education and intelligence unchecked were actually an impediment to wisdom, tolerance, and common sense. I think your desire to educate and teach truth is real. I hope you get there years before I did and don&#39;t end up like Neil deGrasse Tyson or Bill Nye.

Second option is to do a better job of convincing people to treat everything we see online with very critical skepticism. Let&#39;s explore those options:<br><br>Option 1: Having a central body decide what is fact and what is fake, the issue with this method is that we are essentially saying that we want to hand over all control of information delivery to a singular individual or body of individuals. This method means we are accepting this central body as being &quot;the bias we want globally&quot; as there is no human or selected group of humans that have no bias, it&#39;s impossible. We already know the issue with this, if you select ONLY well educated (University or better) individuals the other 85% of the worlds population will feel that news filtering does not represent them as a individual (plus you need to have a serious god complex to believe you are smart enough to think for the entire world), if you select a genuine cross-section of the global population from all walks of life then you will literally have no filtering because in order to achieve a proper cross section you will unavoidably recruit individuals who believe the false information as well as the facts, ultimately leading to exactly where we are today. More to the point of &quot;well-educated&quot; individuals, there is still a belief, and it used to be fact, that educations primary purpose was to program you to become one of the flock, to align your thinking to the rest of the educated, the problem with this is that it actually used to be true, Missionary Schools and Residential Schools being a great example, were all about deprogramming you to think the way you think, and reprogramming you to think the way they want you to think (Native Americans into European thinkers), this may not be the case anymore, but unfortunately it&#39;s hard to forget that was the purpose of school for hundreds of years prior to the 1920&#39;s (some persisted well beyond that, but for the sake of argument, we&#39;ll cut it off at 1920).<br><br>Option 2: Teaching people to be critical and skeptical about information they see online, this isn&#39;t any more possible than making people aware of it, you literally need to convince people to disbelieve everything, including things that only confirm their own bias, myself personally I try to avoid taking the internet more seriously than &quot;hm, that was interesting, but without first hand physical evidence I won&#39;t believe it as pure fact&quot;, and even knowing that and striving for that I still find it difficult to disconnect myself from information that confirms my own pre-conceived beliefs. Additionally, if everyone were convinced to completely discount everything online as being &quot;prone to fact tampering&quot; then whats the point of it even being a information sharing resource?<br><br>The primary core issue is here that to exclude fake from fact you first need to decide which is which, and if it&#39;s a human being doing that then it&#39;s already bias right out of the gate.<br><br>The second issue is that information online is soooo easy to manipulate and tamper with, we&#39;ve seen the deep-fake videos, and sure there are tells, but those fake videos are getting so much better at being faked that soon there will be no way for a human to tell, and once video evidence is removed from the equation all that&#39;s left for us to use to absorb information is written word, which as far as online is concerned, might as well be anecdotal evidence collected in a bias manner and in no way trustworthy. People who have built trust with the general public can be bribed, threatened, blackmailed, and also start slowly losing their minds until the information that many of their followers that learned to trust them as a resource are now being lied to and presented with false information.<br><br>So HOW do we rectify this? Well my method is similar to the scientific method; it isn&#39;t fact until it&#39;s repeatable, if you tell me something, I will believe that it is a possibility, but until I can verify it myself first hand, either visually without digital assistance (as stated, faking a video is pretty easy now, and it just gets easier, so they are no longer considered factual), or physically right in front of me, it is NOT fact yet. Is it perfect? No. Does it mean I am a cynic and a skeptic of everything I see on the internet? Yes. Does it mean I&#39;m misled less? Possibly. Has it corrected any of my own bias? Probably not. Does it mean I regurgitate less fake information to others?

What is absolutely true right now is that a large share of lifetime energy (NOT necessarily CO2) consumption is during the manufacture. Also, BEVs actually need more energy to manufacture than ICE cars do, because battery cell production is an energy intensive operation.<br><br>The energy used to produce steel is consumed in refining the ores used to in the construction (sometimes aluminium, but more usually steel), forming the metals and running the robots and on and on. Just looking at steel, if it is produced in a traditional mill from ore, in a blast furnace, large amounts of metalurgical coke are used mostly to reduce the iron oxide from the ore, but also to add carbon to the iron to make the carbon/iron alloy that is steel. The coke is mostly oxidized to carbon dioxide. However, this is not the only way to make steel. Mini-mills typically use an electric arc furnace to process scrap metal.  Aluminium is mostly produced by electrical reduction of alumina. So both steel and aluminium can be produced using electricity that can be source from a generator that does not emit carbon dioxide.<br><br>For batteries, a significant majority of the energy consumed is used in drying ovens that are required for a wet-electrode process. (Also a significant majority of the investment in a cell production plant a about nine tenths of the production plant real estate). That will likely be mostly eliminated as dry electrode manufacture comes into play (originally Maxwell, now Tesla technology).<br><br>So while many BEV cars nowadays no doubt do cause the emission of more carbon dioxide during manufacture than equivalent ICE cars do, that emission can be massively reduced with &quot;clean&quot; electricity use in all processes. So the best thing to do is probably not to delay purchase of a new car but instead work (hard) towards low carbon dioxide manufacturing and buy &quot;cleanly made&quot; BEV cars.<br><br>This little story holds a number of important morals.<br><br>1) Reality is messy and subject to change.<br>2) As a result, most strongly held beliefs about reality are, at least partly, wrong.<br>3) What is now is not how it will always be.

In fact that is the stance of almost everyone on the left, from the so-called &quot;Woke&quot;, to the progressives, to the socialists. No amount of facts will ever convince them that what they know in their hearts to be truth could be wrong.<br><br>I have tried to engage leftists, and the &quot;Woke&quot; in substantive and intelligent debate on Twitter. Here&#39;s how it ALMOST ALWAYS goes. The Leftist makes an unsupportable and incorrect statement based on the propaganda fed him/her at the time. I refute the statement with facts from multiple credible (not Wikipedia) sources. I get one of three responses. Either they stop responding, call me some kind of &quot;ist&quot; or &quot;phobic,&quot; or spew a bunch of crude expletives.<br><br>The Internet has failed to make people more tolerant for two reasons.<br><br>1) People tend to read, watch, and listen to commentary that reinforces their viewpoints and eschew anything that contradicts their personal view of reality. While it is true of both sides of the political spectrum, it is much more prevalent on the left. All that the Internet does is allow people to reinforce their personal truths by seeking out selective, and biased, information to support those personal truths. What chance do we have when the President of the United States makes a statement like that of Joe Biden?!<br><br>2) The narrative is controlled by the tech giants which are run by leftists. They do this by selectively enforcing ambiguous standards that are applied rigorously and most times unfairly to any narrative with which they disagree, meaning conservative viewpoints. They go so far as to suspend accounts of any person or group that they deem to be spreading, in their personal opinions, harmful information. Can you imagine the chutzpah of Twitter, suspending the account of the President of the United States, or sitting Senators?! It is selective, there is not a single instance where a Democrat, or any other leftist has been censored, even Maxine Watters when she explicitly told her followers to harass and perpetrate violence against political opponents.<br><br>There is not a single place you can post commentary that is not &quot;moderated,&quot; a euphemism for censored. They say they do it, so that people will not be exposed to harmful, and in their opinions, untruthful information. But, that is the whole idea, of the Frist Amendment of the Constitution, anyone can write and say anything, and it is up to the readers, and listeners to decide what is truth and what is not. We do not need, nor want, some &quot;Woke&quot; twenty-something person deciding what we are allowed to read, and hear. That is the very definition of patronizing (a word misused most of the time).<br><br>I taught Physics for thirty-three years, and all Physics teachers accept this one immutable fact, no matter how much you teach and demonstrate truthful facts about physical phenomena, you will NEVER convince students that their personal beliefs (their truths) about phenomena are incorrect. For example, no amount of lecturing, demonstration, and experiment will ever convince a student who believes that heavy objects fall faster than light objects that he/she is wrong. I have asked students at the end of the school term about this, and most of the students who started out with this erroneous belief left class still believing it was true. In fact, many of them think that demonstrations and experiments proving otherwise were tricks designed to confuse them.<br><br>So if we cannot convince people that their personal truths are incorrect about concrete demonstrable phenomena, what chance do we have to do so with ideas, which are much more nebulous?<br><br>Wayne Y.

The ability for something controversial to be considered &quot;fake news,&quot; but still be true, such as your emissions story, makes an algorithm like this very hard. What if it only interprets widely accepted &quot;facts&quot; as news, everything else is &quot;fake news?&quot; Even if those facts have good research to back them up, they can still be wrong. Know what this sounds like to me? The end of science. A lot of science has been, in the past, laughed at. You&#39;ve provided many examples yourself about famous scientists questioning ideas for those ideas to later be proven correct. Those few scientists have been shunned and attacked in the scientific community for daring to think differently. The future where an algorithm determines what is fake or not sounds extremely dangerous. Dissenting opinionsdon&#39;t necessarily count as fake news. The controversial page on reddit may well be a melting pot of radicalism and untruth, but something like this is <b>required</b> in society. The norm must be challenged. Without that, there is no progress.<br><br>Then there&#39;s the problem of statistics. Statistics can be true (i.e. not fake news) but <i>still</i> misleading. &quot;There&#39;s lies, damned lies and statistics.&quot; You could say &quot;half the emissions from a car are from the manufacturing process&quot; and everyone would assume the rest is from the use of the car. What about the recycling or scrapping of the car? It could turn out that only 10% are from the use of the car (I highly doubt this, just using it to illustrate the point!) An algorithm isn&#39;t going to detect these because they are, in effect, actually true. The way information is presented, even if it&#39;s true, can lead to a lot of problems. And whether the information is complete or not will lead to one&#39;s own biases filling in the gaps. So is the answer only to have <i>complete</i> news? Nobody is going to read or watch it.<br><br>There&#39;s also the problem of the creation of the algorithm. Contrary to what you may be thinking, an algorithm isn&#39;t a non-biased fact seeker. Somebody has to make the algorithm. Most likely corporations like Google, Microsoft or Facebook. They will control how it operates, even if very slightly. Their motives are not &quot;pure.&quot; They will use it to make people believe what they want. To bring the world together, perhaps, but under a flag of dogma and dishonesty. But the other option is some sort of governing body who presides over it? Then their biases are going to be incorporated into it. Both options are bad.<br><br>The one thing that I think will really help is to teach children _critical thinking_. Not to have some automated process by which information is filtered, but for people to learn how to filter that information themselves. Most people just don&#39;t know how. They read something on Facebook or hear it from a streamer and, bam, it&#39;s true. They don&#39;t think to question the narrative. <br><br>I think somebody you completely missed in your video as well is the kind of viscous circle or feedback loop of internet communities. The constant positive feedback makes them entrench themselves in their ideas. Outside influences are shunned. The entrenched community&#39;s influencers then often come up with more and more extreme viewpoints which then diffuse back into the wider community. However, how do you choose which groups of entrenched communities are bad? Just hate groups? What about religions groups you don&#39;t agree with? What about the gun control vs gun freedom communities?

However, he followed up with the classic default &#39;well, it&#39;s the best we got&#39;. As the student in this video alluded, he&#39;s holding onto that paper for lack of a better paper to swap with. But, here&#39;s the rub, yes, deductive reasoning(what all science is based on) is a start, but somewhere along the line you make an inductive reasoning statement(a very non-scientific process) . That inductive reason or statement is what people call truth.  Deduction doesn&#39;t lead to what&#39;s true.  It delineates out what&#39;s false. What remains is still waiting to be deducted. At it&#39;s core, what science is, isn&#39;t about seeking truth. It&#39;s about seeking false statements and waiting for everything else to be false too. The inductive reasoning that happens is a leap of faith. The faith is based on the idea that everything else in the data set was put into the pot already, so what&#39;s left is true. But, that&#39;s kind of a God complex thought process. To assume you know all the variables. And science frequently helps us find new variables and challenge our old held beliefs. So what is truth. Clearly, at least in my opinion it&#39;s clear, philosophy and religion come up short for their various reasons as well. In this video the student brought out the idea of swapping out paper for another paper aka:idea. That tells you that no idea is sacred. Any idea can be humbly swapped out. I take issue with the idea that any of those papers are ever &quot;true&quot;.  In short, I&#39;m not sure truth can exist.

They get money in different kinds of ways, but a common consensus is that: more people being active on that website equals more money (be that by using advertisement, or using personal information in the case of facebook to translate it in a different way into money).

I guess you&#39;ll find out a few seconds after you die that you were wrong but then it will be too late.  Google, Facebook, Twitter and YouTube have shown their true colors lately by mounting an all out assault on anyone who they have the slightest suspicion might be conservative.  Many Christians already know massive persecution against Christians is only a short time away and in fact was already happening under Obama ie. Shutting down Christian Bakeries that wouldn&#39;t bake cakes for LGBTQ weddings.   If you are a conservative Christian you can kiss making money on YouTube goodbye because they are getting their powerful AI err  &quot;logarithm&quot; to identify and demonize, I mean demonetize us.  Those in charge of making this decision to demonetize conservatives prove by doing so that they DO NOT truly believe in FREEDOM as such they are not true Americans.  They might legally be Americans but in their heart they are traitors.  Because America is about freedom.  You know very well that if the shoe was on the other foot and conservatives owned Google and demonetized liberal democrats the crying and whining would never stop to the end of time.  And we COULDN&#39;T do that because if we did we would be proving we didn&#39;t believe in freedom. Edit:  The far left here in the US are the ones who were all for making it illegal for the Christian bakeries to not bake cakes for gay couples but they have no problem discriminating against us with their companies.  A little consistency would be nice.  HYPOCRITES!!!  2nd Edit:  It&#39;s really too bad but since these giant companies have chosen to play hardball we really need to get an alternative to YouTube and make it even better and more popular than them as quickly as possible.  I say it&#39;s too bad because they are already here and I hate to discriminate against them but they threw the first punch.  Also sad because I&#39;m super addicted to YouTube :-(  Earlier when I jumped to talking about Christians being persecuted it is because even though there are non-Christian conservatives I believe most conservatives are there because of their faith.  We can not be okay with butchering unborn babies, (abortion,) much less partial-birth abortion.  Every true Christian and conservative American needs to thank God every day that he gave us a brief reprieve from the fast slide into becoming Sodom and Gomorrah we saw under Obama.  Thank God that Trump was elected and do not let anything keep you from voting in 2020.

And, if you think you can have a machine write the filtering algorithm to be unbiased, that can&#39;t happen because the original algorithm contained biases and therefore its products will be biased as well. Their are many examples of such biases in machine learning, and you&#39;re effected by these biases and don&#39;t even realize it. They effect lives and yet no one realizes that they are even subject to these algorithms. Google&#39;s search algorithm may not put fake news at the top (mostly due to human intervention), but it does provide results that are likely to interest you. There by providing results that are skewed to your already held opinions, likes, interests. Google&#39;s results are not unbiased! And, Google does use humans at times to sensor content. Which I think is a big issue because all humans are biased and any censoring they do will reflect their bias. Their have been a few cases where google has wiped someone life history of emails, closed their accounts, and denied them access to Google&#39;s services based on political opinion and not fact! Try this experiment: Use a friend&#39;s computer (it contains cookies that identify them) who holds pollical beliefs that are opposite your own, and do a dozen political searches. in my tests about 50% of the results will contain articles and information that supports the PC owner&#39;s point of view, regardless of facts that can be found online at government sites. To develop an algorithm that could curate such a list of articles to only those that are truthful would require something akin to a general intelligence AI which we are far from achieving at this time. However, even that general AI would contain the biases of those who worked on it and the data it was feed. This is not an easy problem to solve. One could force posters to add citations for their sources but them much news would not be listed as many times revealing sources will keep them from coming forward with information. For the moment the best you can do (and I do) is use a search engine that doesn&#39;t track you and mine you for personal data. These search engines will provide a wider variety of information to you. This wider variety however can be hard to sift through... And, your sifting is subject to your own biases.

The dominance of modernist philosophy, loosely described as objective reasoning, over the past few centuries has been slowly eroded by a growing population of post-modernists (or at least post-modernism influenced people) that fundamentally reject the nature of reality, or truth, as being objective.  This philosophy asserts that reality, truth, can only ever be what an individual perceives it to be.  While a group of people who share a common perception of a given &quot;reality&quot; may congregate and associate with one another, they do not do so based on concession to reasoned argument.  The notion that we can all come together under a unified understanding of reality, trading out flawed opinions for better ones as we go,  is anathema to the post-modernist.  The only time opinions are adopted by the post-modernist are when they better describe/support their preexisting perception of reality.  To attempt to change their mind is vilified as evil, aggressive, and even oppressive if the reality community they belong to is a demonstrable minority.  Hence polarization between opposing opinions naturally polarizes and potentially even escalates to extreme violence.<br><br>I think this is the achilles heel of objectivity and rational debate.  Their utility is ultimately dependent upon voluntary agreement to the terms of what truth is, and in many ways lack the backbone to &quot;impose&quot; that truth or even fight back against someone (or a group) that is willing to manipulate or beat their opposition into silence.

Sorry to bring that mess here, but I assure you I won&#39;t waste your time with the details of that particular argument, just here to point out my revelation on the Polarization of certain groups, allowing misinformation to spread. <br><br>The Flat Earth supporter I responded to was mocking the creator of the video debunking them, by pointing out his number of subscribers in comparison to the person he was debunking...it was significantly lower. And it is kind of a trend when you go across the board of Flat Earth proponents compared to Globe Earth proponents, on YouTube at least....the Flat Earthers have far more subscribers. At first look it seems that their viewpoint must have something going for it, if so many people are subscribed too it...until you really think about what you&#39;re dealing with and analyze things a little closer. You&#39;re dealing with a group that is heavily invested in what they believe compared to a group that isn&#39;t. To a Flat Earther (and to other growing groups thriving on confirmation bias) this movement makes up a HUGE part of their identity, their chips are pushed all in essentially. Meanwhile, the average Globe Earther, doesn&#39;t really care...it doesn&#39;t make up a part of their identity, they weren&#39;t aware this was even a debate to begin with and so they&#39;re less likely to subscribe to something they don&#39;t feel rules over their every waking day. Which sadly means they won&#39;t subscribe to the people on the front lines, doing their best to try and keep this misinformation from doing any more harm. <br><br>So the 2 groups you&#39;re dealing with in this case are very different. Globe Earthers do make up the majority of human society but yet the Flat Earthers do appear to be growing and even outnumbering us in some places, just because it means so much more to them....it&#39;s their arena, not ours. What&#39;s bad about this, is that I think those numbers do play a factor in sucking some people in, I think it does help to spread the misinformation. Because even I looked at the numbers and thought that maybe there was something to be had here....but after 2 years of doing my own research, not only am I still a Globe Earther (or Globtard as they like to call us)....I believe it now more then I ever did, because now I know a lot more about the science, the how and why we came to that discovery. But...some people do get swept away in these communities, especially people who are already poorly educated, paranoid, treated poorly in society, etc. It actually does take a lot of time and effort to disprove a lot of the misinformation that is now being spread these days...and most people just do not have that kind of time or patience. Most people prefer quick easy, digestible answers....it&#39;s just human nature. <br><br>So it is a problem that I think does need addressing, I hope this video does some good in getting that message out there and shedding some light on this problem a little further. Tweaking the Algorithms is a very good suggestion actually, it is at least a start....because you have to be careful as well, at the same time, you don&#39;t want to strip away people&#39;s freedoms to share information and speak on open forums without prosecution. So it&#39;s a very fine line we have to walk and it will be challenging indeed, but I also don&#39;t think it is impossible.

In that case, Breitbart will leave facts behind and defend its tribe.<br>In every other case, like during the election (and really before that and up until today), CNN is demonstrably the king of the fakes, even by admission of its own staff.<br>So if you missed that, the question is, when you asked for algorithms that picks that element of truth in news, what that should be? How can the algorithm tell if, for example, an Infowars article is based on false informations or just on very controversial informations that have not yet made it through the mainstream narrative but it will ultimately end up to be true? Believe it or not, that happened very often. Not always, just often, which is still much better than CNN but is seen as least trusted by those in line with the mainstream. What about predictions by analysts, which are not even facts but just projections? They are neither true or false until the predicted fact happens. I correctly predicted troubles on for the European TAP pipeline a week before a duct exploded in Austria and i predicted that because Germany was going to pursue its new pipeline with Russia that would have pushed Italy to restart its efforts with the TAP and link it with the Russian Turkish Stream. One month later it came out an article stating exactly that. I turned out to be right but how could i have proven that in the moment i said it? I just couldn&#39;t. What is true, even for a smart guy like you, is not easy to say, especially when things get very controversial or very politicized. Algorithms are made by people and people in tech are proven to be most of the time leftists, Google internal messages proved also they are very angry and disrespectful toward right-wingers, and we also know the &#39;fact-checker&#39; agencies they hired are aligned with the radical left, which produced mass censorship of conservatives and a few independent leftists which did not agree with the mainstream insanity of the left. We even know that the cash donations from tech companies to democrats are far bigger than to republicans. Google CEO even created an entire new analytic company just for Hillary Clinton, which makes frankly the Cambridge Analytica story look like a child game compared to that, yet the media are not discussing about that, and Google has much more informations than Facebook, so more cash and more data went from tech companies to the political left and they lost anyway. The have had all the &#39;facts&#39; and numbers and the audience one could possibly ask for, right? Yet they lost anyway, and than again all across Europe and until to even Malaysia last week. So it seems the problem is that what the digital world sells as fact turns out not capable of holding water once brought into the real world. So it&#39;s clearly not them that can solve the problem, they will try to hack the problem and gain more control over the news, not push for more &#39;truth&#39; and facts, since they demonstrated to be not interested in them. The push must come from the outside, from those who every day put their hands on real stuff and don&#39;t waste all their time into the fictional digital world, the so called &#39;silent majority&#39; that you don&#39;t find on social media because it has real stuff to do. The people need to make the regulators and representatives move. If you let the corporations solve this by themeselves, you&#39;ll soon find yourself into a western China. Look at what they do with the internet and AI tracking systems like Sense Time. Who is helping the Communist Party to develop tools for censorship? Exactly Facebook. They are not gonna solve the problem. They are gonna make it worse. In my opinion, they just tried to put too many tricks into these algorithms. I&#39;d either roll them back, oversimplifying them in order to remove bias or just scrap them completely.

Because, you see, truth is a word normally wrapped around meanings that are extremely heavy but at the same time abstract. He talks about truth like its something that is just there and people can easily agree on, like that&#39;s the absolutely natural thing to happen, the right thing to happen. The thing is, people don&#39;t have to agree on everything, and not just that, probably never will. Every one carries within themselves a sea of feelings and interpretations and imagination and experiences and quali, a philosophical term that perhaps encompass well what I&#39;m trying to mean by all that, and there&#39;s no way for truth to escape the forced freedom that is our underlying experience of reality. By that, I&#39;m saying that if you think about people, the root of ones beliefs is something pretty much untouchable, in many ways, inaccessible, it is our very own nature.

You are asking for a way to take subjective, opinion biased observations made by unskilled, emotional, humans and extract from that some kind of objective (scientific) truth. I am not sure that is possible. There is science. There is philosophy. It has never been clear to me that a philosophical approach can be distilled into a scientific truth or fact using even the most highly intellectual methods of philosophical reasoning and argumentation. Moreover, a fact in the scientific sense is something that can be proven repeatably and, in it&#39;s most useful form, cannot be sensibly argued or changed by any living human anywhere on the planet. It is &quot;objectively&quot; true.<br><br>A philosophical truth, or subjective truth,  is a bit like a &quot;democratic&quot; consensus that a &quot;concept&quot; is valid, and while a few people sitting around in Plato&#39;s garden may reach such a consensus about the character of a &quot;good man&quot; one  evening, a group sitting around in Buddhas&#39;  living room will likely come to a completely different consensus, and neither is more valid than the other. Accordingly these are not truths in any fundamental sense, but they might be useful, nevertheless, in governing a human society. <br><br>Fake NEWS is not about the realm of fiction or fact. It is about opinion, preconceived mindsets, feelings, beliefs in very non-scientific notions about concepts like &quot;right&quot; and &quot;wrong&quot;.  Fake news is about propaganda, manipulation, deception, lying all directed to some specific objective or outcome, like winning an election. What &quot;indicators&quot; and AI might use to discern truth, therefore, becomes very difficult to imagine since, even the most erudite of academic scientists are human, and in the domain of human relationships, politics, their opinions are no more inherently valid than those of a homeless wino living in disused dumpster.  Given the quantum mechanical nature of DNA, and personality that must be derived from DNA somehow, it seems plausible that there may be actual scientific laws that govern the scientific behaviour of subjective truth.  I agree with you 100%, we need to find something to sort it out.  How we maintain free speech and limit the right of fools or criminals who attempt to manipulate masses with deception...that might be easier, but you see how the objective and subjective can generally require utterly different conceptual bases for investigation.", "comment_date": "2018-03-26T15:07:39Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Doc Moore", "comment_text": "Your thought that CNN is more likely to be true than Breitbart signals your liberal bias.

Like the papers with ideas being changed for better ones. I was surprised however that in this discussion \u00a0only social media was put to trial. There was no mention of how education has failed to teach people to learn or to make informed choices.

How many times can I question what I know to be true before I become completely frustrated? Many people ask the questions but do not really want the responsibility that comes with the answers. They just want to cure symptoms to diseases that go deeper than a headache and a sore throat. We are all so busy all the time making money and seeking &quot;happiness&quot; that caring about what is true regardless of its convenience becomes a test of will. People get news on social media cause they are relaxing there and they just casually read some titles and an article or two so they wont really fact check cause that would take them out of the relaxation state they are supposed to be in and so they will keep on reading the &quot;facts&quot; from the same papers or blogs to avoid the effort. That&#39;s why arguing is futile. It&#39;s because they are not there for the truth but for information that doesn&#39;t challenge their lifestyle or worldview. I do not think Facebook or the internet are to blame. It&#39;s more about challenging the concept of comfort and happiness we have been taught to be ideal.

Of course this approach can quickly give rise to prejudice so at minimum there should be a message to say that unverified does not mean false.<br>  - Programming (at least the language of Python) has a concept of what it calls Duck-Typing. It is a thought pattern along the lines of &quot;if it looks true then it must be true&quot; (look it up instead of just taking my interpretation). This is a clearly flawed, and even frustrating, mentality that is powerful and important. Psychology touches on this with its idea of association during conditioning (not to be confused with the mathematical association as I would describe it to be a probabilistic implication) whereby someone with repeated experience takes that experience to be true and thus learns. Indeed, when we are very young and lack information, this kind of thinking seems to be a requirement (but the later going back and verifying is often missed). Its power comes in the form of enabling the possibility of analogies and symbolism in language and help with communicating (requiring imperfection) of foreign concepts. Indeed, much of our cultural expression (like poetry) is built upon this flawed idea (even because it is flawed).<br>  - There is a huge tendency for people, and also a basic design principle, to have a black box understanding (as opposed to a white box). This is throwing inputs at it and expecting outputs without seeing or understanding what is happening. Perhaps this is magnified by the inability to completely remove all black boxes at any given moment, the mind just cannot handle that much information. It is quite amazing that it is possible to understand the world through black boxes otherwise we would have died out before we invented the science required to unlock those black boxes.", "comment_date": "2017-11-01T23:29:05Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Scott Dragon", "comment_text": "This video exemplifies exactly what the problem is, A teacher blowing wind up his own professions butt, A profession that is not based on intelligence, it is based totally on recall, intelligence and recall are NOT the same thing. deciding on what is fake news and what is real news must not be put into the hands of those whose only success in life is through  being able to parrot what they have been taught, without having the ability to weigh up each supposed fact in a rational manner. this post and others like it are enabling the continued brain washing of the masses, and the sad part is  that the authors are too dumb to know it.", "comment_date": "2017-10-31T02:26:46Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Orasorb", "comment_text": "I agree with the idea, but disagree semantically.

So does the entire video above. The very title encourages opinion seeking. The whole video ends before anything about facts is ever a focus. You can ask if facts matter to you anymore, or if we think facts matter to others anymore. But the title assumes an opinion right off the bat, so the only factual answers we can get to are opinions. I can guess that the title means &quot;aren&#39;t cared for anymore&quot;.

We are discussing people obsessed with relativity, opinions and emotional feelings lacking anchored wisdom.. Facts require a commitment to truth.The answer, here, is that facts always matter because of truth. People are just beginning not to care. I believe the question, in a guessing opinion of assumption, is really about why people don&#39;t care for facts anymore. ( i.e. it is a fact people are talking about true news and fake news. But it is also a fact that calling something true or fake based on the common usage of the phrases does not reflect on whether &quot;true news&quot; is factually true, or if &quot;fake&quot; is factually fake.

Talking about this problem (sharing the insight of it&#39;s existence) as the next step is what makes social animals (especially humans) such a big evolutionary hit, because by croudsourcing, you can reach people who are better suited to adress the problem, and often a lot of them. This is one of the reason&#39;s why I love this video. Pseudofacts, alternative facts, and post-factism are the shadow realm of this communicative culture. Add cognitive ease, which you&#39;ve discussed in another video, and the extreme speed of information transmission on the internet, and you get exactly what you are pointing out in this episode: Before the internet, we had gossip; you generally believe what your friends share with you, and your friends have other firends who have other friends and somewhere, a toxic virulent idea escapes a breedcage of neurons and uses your entire social network as a trojan horse into your mind (and, those of your social network members) at mouseclick/screentap speed. Luckily, many of my friends are deep thinkers (like 10+% on facebook), and I believe this can have an immunizing effect against toxic virulent memes, as long as your systems aren&#39;t too compromised they can also help you recover from these TVM/I&#39;s (Toxic Virulent Meme/Idea is not a coined term afaik). I have no idea how badly compromised a person can be before they are so resistant to &#39;the truth&#39; that it can&#39;t bring them back anymore, since &#39;the truth&#39; is really hard to figure out even for very smart and thorough people (damn you, cognitive ease!). There was once a rather successful ideological reprogramming compaign in Germany after the Nazi Regime had fallen, but these extreme measures are hardly justifiable under the current circumstances, and justifiability is another issue when it comes to the kind of &#39;truth mission&#39; I am inferring you would like to have on the internet. Basically it comes down to the argument of &quot;Sticks and Stones&quot;; while EU has legally obligated facebook et alii to moderate their comment in a manner that extreme misogynist, racist and other hateful content be removed within 24 hours, fake news doesn&#39;t generally fit these criteria and removing this would be illegal censorship. A fake news identifier algorithm would have to carry a disclaimer saying that it is merely a warning of potentially fake news and that it is up to every individual to discern for themselves the validity of the content being shared, though it arguably might help people to use their brains a bit more and do proper research.

What will it work on - consensus? or rationality? or a group of elite humans? In a total relativistic place, choosing any one thing over the other is domination? Which star potential should get to shine in the sky? It is just might is right? and might is consensus - the lowest denominator(democracy)? OR the highest denominator(elite)? What would be the policy? Also what is the truth when swamped with a flood of absolute relativism?  What is the deeper unity we are missing? Will truths forever keep competing and the people who use the most tricks (sexualizing content, sensationalizing content, putting controversial triggering content, backing up content with enrollment under an authority) will have the upper hand? Is stuff just Darwinian OR does existence decide what gets to be reality and what gets to be fringe reality and what gets to be dormant potential waiting to come out? In the plurality of values, what values will be chosen? Is it all just the play of god with no answer really? Whoever has the most force in him and whenever that force colludes with the greatest majority that will become the system of power? How is the movement from the drawing board of reality(realm of philosophy, idea, potentials) to actual hard manifestation going to happen? Who is going to decide meaning? Should it be a jungle order with no overarching authority or should we go with an elite authority structure? Isn&#39;t that like choosing between the mother(nature) vs. father(discrete world-view)?

So while a case could be made about the amount of emissions.  If those same workers were driving emission free vehicles (for example) the case becomes much more different.  If the energy generated to smelt materials and move materials were electric from sustainable sources then you would have greatly improved the emissions from the building of a new car.  So the estimate is both far reaching and presumptive.  It is far reaching in so much as to include things that are indirect resulting in carbon emissions.  It is presumptive in that it presumes that all methods use their worst carbon outcome.  Finally, the statement is defeatist.  It defeats the cause for change.

But it is mostly the liberals with &#39;college degrees&#39; that are smug and pretend to know it all. It wasn&#39;t like that in the past but it is like that right now, maybe it will change in the future. Yeah, we all live in echo chambers, including scientists who remain blind to many facts that the conservatives point out (like the demographic crisis of the west that many on the left celebrate or the utter nonsense of some leftist ideas). If your science is so good and capable of predicting everything why didn&#39;t it predict this turn of events with the internet? And why do you have to search for explanations post-factum? It ain&#39;t easy for the scientist, the &#39;bringer of truth&#39;, the &#39;vanquisher of the fake news&#39;, &#39;the nemesis of cognitive biases&#39;, to admit that he has blindspots but that&#39;s the sad truth - identifying your biases and talking about them on YouTube does not make you any less biased. Believing you&#39;ve overcome your biases by using &#39;science&#39; makes you even more biased than the people you&#39;re fighting against.

Truth often relies upon history.<br><br>Every aspect of our lives are out of order and incorrect. <br><br>Wiki often takes what is happening now and will over look what was. <br><br>For an example a simple thing a common electrical relay a &quot;double pole, double throw&quot; relay, the terminology is wrong. What you get if you ask for one at a store is actually a relay controlled by a magnetic coil, it has four sets of points inside. Two sets of points in its normal unpowered state are closed allowing power through while the coil is not energized, these are the normally closed contacts. The other two sets of points when the coil is powered close and allow power through the normally open points, that are open when the coil is not energized. Powering the coil opens the other normally closed points simultaneously (See Note Bellow) <br><br>One throw can operate a number of poles or just one. Depending on the type of switch or relay, the throw can have multiple positions. <br><br>A throw is the lever on a switch or switching device that engages electrical contacts. Electrical contacts are actually just air condensers the charge in a ramping voltage through the dielectric, the air, to stop the flow of electricity across the points. Because only electricity can stop electricity. No elemental substance on earth stops the flow of electricity in any way. It requires the charging and ramping of voltage within the insulator or dielectric to do so.  <br><br>Well if a throw is the lever that moves the points, then a double throw would have two levers. Older motor starting switches had just that to ramp up power to large motors and reduce the inrush current to the motors while starting. You would in some order throw the switches on the switching bank one by one as the motor came to speed. <br><br>My point is that the device we currently call a (&quot;double pole, double throw&quot;) relay or switch, actually is a double pole two position relay or two pole normally open normally closed relay. It has a single throw that has two positions. Some switching devices are still labeled like this correctly. <br><br>Yet the madness goes on. And Wiki just does not want to know. Terminology right and wrong is a vote now not a right or wrong. <br><br>Guys that use these relays do not need the terminology because they understand them. But it is just yet another basic twisting things. <br><br><br>Note: <br>Although the points break physical contact with the normally closed points before making contact with the normally open points. It takes longer to electrically disconnect points than it does to make a new connection in a relay. In a coil relay an arm controlled by a magnetic coil, has four points on it, two on each side of the arm. The points on the arm are connected to the common inputs of the relay. When the arm is not being moved by the coil it is connecting the normally closed contacts to the common inputs. When the coil is energized the arm moves away from the normally closed contacts and swings over to the normally open contacts connecting them to the common inputs. However if power is applied to the normally closed points, and there is another source of power applied to the normally open contacts, even though, the arm will physically disconnect from the normally open points first, an ARC will carry power across the blown air capacitor, and short the two power supplies. Much like lift ARC TIG welding creates an ARC by first touching a live electrode to the work piece and then lifting the electrode off the work, which creates or initiates an ARC.  <br><br>Sincerely, <br><br>William McCormick", "comment_date": "2017-02-26T18:13:09Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "AsgaiaMetal", "comment_text": "Most or all politicians and ideologies were never based on real, scientific facts.

For example - in last year group of smart people found an evidence for existing a gravity waves. But if you look closer to their work you will find out that they spend a LOT! of effort and many and they just discovered something like the surface of problem, being at the same time really far from the center of problem.

The answer can be divined somewhat from your earlier (and also excellent) exploration of gravity waves and the machine(s) constructed to measure them. As it was observed there is much noise and imprecision in the machinery designed to measure, however by designing a machine to measure one specific thing (and nothing more) you are able to answer that question with precision.

It&#39;s a human thing. But i do think it can be mitigated on the interne if you change the revenue model. Websites like Facebook and youtube are businesses. They have to make money. They make money with advertisement. It is in their best interest to keep people watching (kind of like tv channels). Most people want to watch things they like, things they are familiar with, things they already agree with. The websites therefore tailor your feed to stuff you are interested in, things you like because that will keep you watching so they can sell more advertisement space. So you only see what you already agree with. You never (or rarely) see other points of view. That i think is a big cause of the balkanisation.  If they didn&#39;t rely on advertisement  for revenues, maybe they could shape the algorithms to instead broaden your view. Now what they could use as revenue stream i can not say. paid subscriptions? Who would voluntarily pay money to see things they do not agree with? Government subsidies?

And the &quot;solution&quot; to climate catastrophism is to tax energy to raise prices and reduce consumption.

Can we please bring these categories closer? Well we might roughly map them to ontology and epistemology - being and knowing.<br><br>  Questions: If something is true, does that mean we will believe it? Because we believe something, does that make it true? Does truth exist as a category that transcends our ability to apprehend it? <br><br>  Is truth absolute, or are some things truthier than others? Or both?<br><br>  We all start with propositions that we consider axiomatic eg.&#39; the whole is greater than the part&#39; etc. Do we determine these with logic (algorithms), or are they intuitive? Are these the ground for a priori facts eg. &#39;all bachelors are unmarried&#39; etc? Are some of these tautological facts defined by observation or intuition? Ex. triple point of water, E = mc2.  Do some laws (eg. conservation) lend themselves to strict mathematical proofs, or are they essentialy intuitive? Are Noetherian Symmetries a product of algorithm or human intuition?<br><br>  Does some truth exist in another category altogether? That is. contingent, existential truth, like the eigenstate of a particle, or what time it is right... now.  Or just how much is the global average temperature rising? Or whether CNN is more trustworthy than Breitbart?<br><br>  I previously quoted G.K. Chesterton, and it bears repeating and expanding:<br>   &quot;The relations of logic to truth depend, then, not upon its perfection as logic, but upon certain pre-logical faculties and certain pre-logical discoveries, upon the possession of those faculties, upon the power of making those discoveries. If a man starts with certain assumptions, he may be a good logician and a good citizen, a wise man, a successful figure. If he starts with certain other assumptions, he may be an equally good logician and a bankrupt, a criminal, a raving lunatic. Logic, then, is not necessarily an instrument for finding truth; on the contrary, truth is necessarily an instrument for using logic\u2014for using it, that is, for the discovery of further truth and for the profit of humanity. Briefly, you can only find truth with logic if you have already found truth without it.&quot;<br><br>  I sincerely admire Derek&#39;s sense of wonder at some of the bigger questions as well as his ability to detangle and communicate some pretty difficult subject matter, but he doesn&#39;t seem to have the language to grapple with these issues he presents here.

Also I probably should&#39;ve read through the comments incase someone else has said something similar first but eh might as well keep this fresh and &quot;uninfluenced&quot;<br><br>The first is that I feel like I should say that I am a person very interested in knowledge wherever it may be found, science,math, enligsh, psychology and so on. On top of that I have recently become a person that is highly influenced by eastern philosophies. Yet I was raised in the United States so I have this weird dual phiisophical perspective of things. Just so people may have an idea of where i am coming from on this.<br><br>Okay preliminary stuff out of the way...<br>I think what we are seeing today with the internet and its effects on us in a social sense is exactly what the internet is designed to do. This point of view I got from a few things. <br><br>The first big one is that my friends and I when hanging out the other day came to a theory that the internet, how it is designed and how it functions is that it is a virtual representation of human conciousness. Honestly, we didn&#39;t even think that that is much of a stretch considering things like social media where people have things such as profiles (represantations) of themselves online that they develop and grow. But, along with this, I dont think that it is a total representation of human conciousness but rather it is network that only represents how we humans view ourselves, that is to say it is a representation of our own representation of ourselves.This is where I&#39;d have to tie in my basic knowledge of eastern philosophies. <br><br>All of us have egos, our roles to play in society. It&#39;s how we identify ourselves and think of ourselves. It&#39;s your name, your job, your parents, the things you like how you see the world etc etc. Just like the all the ways in which you could divide your self or others into boxes/labels. In eastern philosophies though the ego is not the real self. You are not your name your job, your title or so on. Instead the real self is seen as if the ego is an organism in and environment the real self is the total ecosystem of the organism and environment together. And from the perspective of the real self the ego is an incomplete and false representation of the true total self. <br><br>Back to the internet. As i see the internet, it is a big REALLY big network or system that is a representation of humanity&#39;s collective ego. It is a network of how we see ourselves. <br><br>This is where the second thing comes in. This is one thing I liked about how derek tied biology into this evolution, because it&#39;s similar to how i looked at this. But i think tieing it only to ideas is not good enough and incomplete. doing that puts the idea as the organism in the process of evolution, but going back to biology and eastern philosophy what changes isn&#39;t just the organism or the environment but the whole ecosystem. As one changes so does the other. So Instead I&#39;d think of the internet itself as the organism going through evolution and ideas being one organism in that environment. So with that I think the polarization of people into boxes and more and more groups forming and being at odds with other groups is just what the internet is designed to do. <br><br>Take philosophy aside if it sounds far fetched and go to psychology the equivalent of the ego would just be the left brain. Logical thinking and what not. In short all logical thinking (and this is a very simplified view) is basically breaking things apart and matching them up. Putting things into boxes  And that&#39;s what we&#39;re told the left brain does and is good at (in a very general sense). And we perfected this with computers which are nothing but logic, and also are what we could call the cells that make up the organism known as the internet...<br><br>A pure manifestation of logic (and logic as in putting things into boxes)<br><br>So overall i see the internet as a new type of organism. Created by the ego, or left brain that is doing its job. Taking egos and putting egos where they belong which leads to seperation and polarization.<br><br>Now this is where I&#39;d like to address Derek&#39;s points. Overall there is no way to change the internet in the way you&#39;re describing (bringing us together, like ALL GROUPS) because that whole idea is fallacy (at least from my perspective) and as i hopefully explained is contradictory to what the internet is supposed to do. You yourself and people who will read this comment are a niche INSIDE the internet (a collective ego) and because of that you cannot change the basic function of the internet. Your views that truth is a virtue and that everyone should come together and what not are a group or niche no different than the groups that say everyone should be seperate. Both of which are a part of the system. A dog can&#39;t change itself into being a cat. It&#39;s like inertia, an OUTSIDE force must stop and object or move an object. Your attempt to change the internet is a result of the internet. And any method to change the internet will just take place inside of the internet, again inertia says this won&#39;t change anythnig you need an OUTSIDE force. And because of overall reasons that I won&#39;t get into now, this is impossible to find. There is no outside force that will change the internet.<br><br>I think what is more important is the results of the internet and deal with those as opposed to trying to change it. Becasue from my view of things this change will never happen, but what could possibly be pevented or slowed is the results of humans being on the internet. Because such a thing unlike any other time in human history has never existed. So i think we need to adapt to the internet as opposed to changing it.

I live in Norway and drive an electric car. In this case the manufacturing and distribution of the car accounts for nearly 100% of the lifetime emissions of the vehicle, for the simple reason that electricity in Norway is all renewable, CO2-free hydropower. The only reason it is &quot;nearly 100%&quot; and not 100% is that the car will need several sets of wind tyres, window wipers and to have the brake fluid replaced over its life. (But so does any other car, and the electric drivetrain needs much less maintainance than a fossil one, so the advantage of EVs is greater, not less, if one includes maintenance in the picture.)<br><br>The only way to interpret the claim that seems to make it something that would be relevant (if true, more on that later) is if it applies to fossil cars, on average, today. If the manufacture of cars today really did cause 50% of the total emissions that stem from cars then EVs would only be radically better if they improved both the manufacturing and use emissions.<br><br>But is it really? The Guardian ran a piece that superficially appears to support Veritasium&#39;s claim, until you scrutinize it:<br><br>&quot;Making a new car creates as much carbon pollution as driving it, so it&#39;s often better to keep your old banger on the road than to upgrade to a greener model.&quot;<br><br><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/green-living-blog/2010/sep/23/carbon-footprint-new-car\">https://www.theguardian.com/environment/green-living-blog/2010/sep/23/carbon-footprint-new-car</a><br><br>According to this, a mid-sized car has a manufacturing footprint of 17 tons CO2. <br><br>How large is the USE footprint over the life of the car? The least CO2-intensive fleet in the world is in Europe, and the average new car sold in 2015 officially emits 137 g/km. Unfortunately, <i>officially</i> does not mean <i>really</i>. As Transport &amp; Environment has documented (and the European Commission is currently sueing several member states for!), car makers have been systematically cheating the system while the national type approval authorities have turned a blind eye. The gap between NEDC official consumption (and therefore CO2 emissions) has grown from 8% to over 40% in the last 15 years. Even the real-world emissions are representative only of good conditions, but almost all cars are driven in bad conditions some of the time.<br><br>All in all, 200 g/km is a more realistic estimate for real-world emissions. But this is just the <b>tailpipe</b> emissions. Just like the footprint of generating the electricity must be included in an EVs CO2 accounts, so must the upstream emissions of making and distributing the fuel. And as it happens it is <b>huge</b>. The fossil fuel chain requires energy and CO2 worth <b>at least</b> 1,5 units for every unit of fuel it supplies! <br><br>So the total emissions are at least 500 g/km for a typical new car in Europe - and I must remind you this is the least CO2-intensive car fleet in the world (but it isn&#39;t clean by any means, due to the high proportion of diesel cars which emit far more NOx than gasoline cars). <br><br>This also assumes that the cars emissions per km stay constant over its life. In reality it doesn&#39;t. They increase fairly linearly by about 20% over the course of it&#39;s life, so we should add 10% to the total. (And note how this is in sharp contrast to EVs, where the ongoing emissions are reduced as the electricity supply becomes less carbon intensive.)<br><br>That means the car has to be driven just under 31,000 kilometers to get to the point where use emissions overtake manufacturing emissions. Some cars are driven more than a million kilometers. Some crash and are taken out with only a few thousand kilometers on the odometer. But new cars in Europe are today sold with a warranted 100,000 to 160,000 km, and we can quite conservatively estimate they will last at least 200,000 km on average. <br><br>So then we have<br> - manufacturing:  17 000 kg<br> - use: 200 000 * 0,55 kg = 110 000 kg<br> - manufacturing share of total = 17/127 = 13.4%<br><br>Manufacturing an EV is about 15% more carbon intensive than an ICE vehicle according to the Union of Concerned Scientists. It&#39;s use, even on a dirty grid, is much less carbon intensive than any fossil car, because the car is radically more efficient (an electric motor is 90-95% efficient in a wide range of conditions, a combustion engine about 25% in ideal conditions), and even coal power is a more efficient supply chain than distributing refined fuels to tanks.<br><br>All of this said, there is no doubt that switching to electric cars and otherwise continuing business as usual is not enough to fix transportation. Since the average car is parked 95% of the time it stands to reason that a lot can be achieved by sharing fewer cars among more people and inventing forms of public transit that are as convenient as having one&#39;s own car but increasing the number of occupants in the average car.

This is an issue which sits close to my heart, and I&#39;m glad that you address it. <br><br>Having said that, here goes.<br><br>I don&#39;t agree that you hold Facebook (and other large curators of information) responsible for ensuring that our information comes to us reliably. I think that there is a distinction between websites built largely for entertainment (which I see Facebook as), and websites built as repositories of knowledge (like Wikipedia). The two should not be mixed. It doesn&#39;t make sense (to me) that a site built for entertainment should have non-factual information &#39;censored&#39;, either by algorithm or aggressive moderation. I think instead that the responsibility should largely fall on the user to realise the difference between entertainment and fact, and that different sources will present different material. For instance, I wouldn&#39;t watch the Lion King and conclude that lions can talk. <br><br>With regards to Facebook (and other similar sites), the bias introduced by sorting algorithms to promote more interesting/shocking/incredible (read: fake) news is almost intrinsic to a site where popularity is king. I&#39;m not saying that news (true or not) shouldn&#39;t be shared on Facebook, but that people should recognize that they ARE on a site built largely for entertainment, and not the dissemination of factual information. I would argue that well told stories - never mind their factual reliability - have their place as a means of entertainment, and are certainly suited to being shared, changed a little, and shared again; evolving as ideas.<br><br>I do realise that telling people what they &quot;should&quot; do is a ridiculous solution. I realise too, that it&#39;s much, much more difficult to hold the entire internet accountable, rather than a few large companies. But, I think that educating people to be critical of their sources has a much more meaningful impact in the long run. Ostensibly, everyone knows not to trust everything they read on the internet, but it&#39;s far too much effort to care enough to do some reason. Far too much effort to think about the other side of the argument. Maybe the fact that humans are lazy is part of this.<br><br>I found it interesting that you mentioned that people don&#39;t care whether or not things are true, and I don&#39;t disagree Maybe that&#39;s the first thing that needs to change? <br><br>TLDR: Don&#39;t believe everything you see on the internet!

Why is everyone suddenly super concerned about fake news? It seems like it was an idea meme that got shared by news and picked up by the populous. A lot of people claim real news is fake and fake news is real per their bias. Any obvious effort to mitigate fake news will be met with heavy criticism, I don&#39;t think decreasing the amount of fake news will fix anything, and it might make the problem worse. I think &quot;fake news&quot; has been around for a LONG time. <br><br>I really like the meme evolution analogy, I think the best way to fix the problem is by incentivizing cross pollination. I&#39;m often not welcomed in communities I disagree with, which I think is perfectly fine, but it&#39;s hypocritical when those communities complain that other communities keep to themselves. The excuse is often given, that what others contribute isn&#39;t the topic of the group, which is of course reasonable, though when that reason is used only room exclude diversity, it leads to a monoculture of ideas. <br><br>I don&#39;t have any good suggestion for how to incentivize people to welcome diverse ideas, but I do know that calling people names for being wrong is exactly the wrong incentive, that&#39;s been going on for decades. <br><br>Basically I&#39;m saying, I think the only way to fix fake news is to wholly and kindly welcome it, anything else would be perceived as social censorship which will receive retaliation which will likely be worse. I think it has to be repaired through welcoming, patient, civil discourse. <br><br>Unfortunately, I don&#39;t think many people are actually interested in fixing the problem of fake news, I think most people are only interested in making people who they disagree with shut up. Many things labeled fake news are really just ambiguous news mixed with opinion, as long as opinion is clearly labeled, it&#39;s not fake news and if a person is intellectually honest they should stop misrepresenting others positions. <br><br>I think this is one of the better thought out discussions I&#39;ve heard in quite some time.", "comment_date": "2016-12-24T16:09:31Z", "likes_count": 39}, {"comment_by": "Nathan Fielure", "comment_text": "Facts are for losers, geniuses make their own realities.", "comment_date": "2016-12-24T16:00:06Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "richnfamous", "comment_text": "there <b>is</b> an antidote to &#39;fake news&#39;: it&#39;s called journalism... but not the kind you&#39;ll find in, say, the Murdoch press. however, real journalism isn&#39;t doing very well these days - for a number of reasons - and the patently false gets mixed in with the &#39;churnalism&#39; of cheap media production which often isn&#39;t verified, just pumped out because there&#39;s space to fill<br><br>i try to use different sources, which doubtless have their own agenda, and triangulate using the basic principle of &#39;who benefits&#39;? if it looks like a duck, quacks like a duck, waddles like a duck, and the president is against ducks...", "comment_date": "2016-12-24T15:36:22Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Insider Gamer", "comment_text": "Good point that Facebook should do better job in fighting fake news, just like Google does.

Since a couple of months I have no cable anymore, because I&#39;m at a point where that anything that is done to make money, is untrue for me.

If only because, as you said, some people just won&#39;t hear it.  All we can do is make sure that all the information (objectively and subjectively true or not) is available.  People who don&#39;t care to research will think whatever they&#39;re fed, and their opinions will continue to not actually matter to the rest of the world.

The problem is I thought all the &quot;fake&quot; news would come from right wing.

Interesting that no one brought the concept of &quot;fake news&quot; up until trump won the election. <br>All the liberal news sources like the guardian and the rest have talking about fake news nonstop since the democrats lost. To the extreme left the concept of fake news is very convenient. It allows them to discredit all other opposing information as fake. Earlier in the year they tried flat out censorship of opinions and information that they didn&#39;t agree with. The backlash was huge. (If you weren&#39;t there for it  Facebook, Twitter and Google were all involved in it.)  <br><br>I have been watching both sides of the debate all year and the number one producer of fake news has been the liberal news sources. <br><br>Its funny because Derek has been fooled by the very algorithm he is talking about. Because he is liberal he has only been receiving information about how much of a problem fake news is.<br>The worst part is to fix the fake news problem (which only the left is calling for) Would involve suppressing information they don&#39;t believe is correct, even if its the truth. The problem here is that the truth is very hidden. Even the guardian sometimes lists references. The problem is that there is so much crap out there that going only one reference deep can lead you to disinformation. It takes a lot of work to fact check. <br><br>Even then, how you interpret the information can be distorted by bias also. The news and re-posters don&#39;t have the time to trace back the references all the way to the truth. Because of this &quot;fake news&quot; will still spread as everyone will just start listing enough sources so the anti &quot;fake news algorithm&quot; wont notice it. Even if the sources are misquoted or the reference come from a dodgy source. Things get really bad when you notice that even good sources can be incorrect. Derek even made a video about this a while ago. Standing on the shoulders of giants is how research papers are made. <br>But if the references you use for your paper are incorrect your standing on disinformation. And others stand on your disinformation.

Overall, I think it is leading us to a good direction, and is doing a lot more good, than harm.<br> It is easy to focus on the negative, and see all this division, while ignoring the many people that have gotten out of situations that would otherwise be impossible to escape from, such as: a child growing up, losing their faith, and escaping from the tyranny of a society dominated by a religion that oppresses people, and tries to take away their individual freedom of expression.<br><br>You touched on this when you were talking about the forming of groups that has no borders.<br>\u00a0Where previously (before the internet) people would find community and form alliances that were restricted to a country, or even city, or even neighborhood (depends on how far back in time we go. Before the rise of technology and science, most people didnt know anyone outside of their immediate vicinity), now its possible to form communities/alliances/groups or even whole movements, that are boundless, the &quot;ends&quot; of the earth is the limit (and maybe soon not even the earth, we might go past that).<br><br>Also, while I understand your reservations about creating controversy, and I agree that it often causes people to react, retaliate, and just become more entrenched in their own beliefs, this is merely an initial reaction.<br>You see, even though people get emotionally attached to their beliefs, and dont want to let them go, are afraid to be wrong, and just want people who disagree with them to be wrong, at the end of the day they want to be right.<br>\u00a0And on some level, even a minimal level, they do care whether or not what they believe is actually true.<br><br>So after having an initial knee-jerk reaction, and seeking things and people that reaffirm their beliefs and opinions, they will actually look at the thing that they disagree so much, and attempt to prove it wrong.<br>And here&#39;s the sweet part: When they fail to prove the claim/belief/idea wrong, something awesome happens. They begin to doubt. Even a tiny spark of doubt can be enough to start a fire.<br> Doubting your beliefs, and self-checking to make sure you are not wrong is fundamental to figuring out the truth. Self-correction, self-criticism, and examining your own beliefs are traits of a skeptical mind.<br><br>If you simply get people to doubt, even a little bit, thats the only way that they can realize they are wrong. This is why religions like Christianity, warn against doubt. They tell people that to doubt is a sin, and the devil will try to make them doubt their beliefs. Its a key mechanism to try to trap people in this horribly immoral belief system.<br><br>In order to get people to doubt, you have to stir up controversy. You have to be aggressive, and blunt, and really poke people&#39;s buttons.<br>Like I always say, if you dont create controversy, and piss people off, you&#39;re doing it wrong (when we are talking about changing what people think).<br><br>What you do, is try to avoid stirring up controversy, try to avoid causing that emotional reaction people have, when they find something they strongly disagree with.<br>But if you look at the comments below, you&#39;ll find that there is a TON of disagreement even among your own fans.<br>People are going to argue and debate about pretty much anything, and that is good. As long as your mind is engaged, and your beliefs challenged, then you at least have hope of avoiding false beliefs and correcting your flawed reasoning.<br><br><b>A mind and a belief that is unchallenged, is one that cannot be changed.</b><br><br>But here&#39;s the thing: <br>What I&#39;ve noticed from people like you, and VSauce, is that you really dont care that much about exposing people to the facts, to the truth, but rather you want to make people think. You give people food for thought, and in some cases you try to teach them HOW to think, as opposed to what to think. You try to avoid the knee-jerk reaction by making people investigate and think for themselves.<br><br>This is very very good, but is also extremely difficult to pull.<br>Not only that, but if you do it the wrong way, you might end up making people think the wrong way, the irrational way, and that can have an even worse effect than simply becoming more entrenched in their beliefs.<br>You try to promote science and rational thought, I think. But this alone just isnt enough, and it only works on some people. A small niche of people, like you said.<br><br>What really makes a difference, in the long run, regarding of what we believe as a species, or as the consensus of the majority, is having an open marketplace of ideas (I dont think we really have an open marketplace of ideas, but it is close).<br>An open marketplace of ideas, where arguments and ideas are constantly battling each other. And like natural selection, it weeds out the bad ideas and leaves the good ideas unharmed. <br> The bad ideas will tend to die out, because they just wont stand against scrutiny, they will fall against the ever-growing criticism of people that oppose those ideas. Similarly, the people that oppose those ideas might have some bad ideas themselves, and those ideas wont stand against scrutiny.<br>Standing against scrutiny, in a test of time, is what will eventually lead our species towards more rationally justified beliefs.<br><br>It wasnt considered irrational, once upon a time, to believe that evil spirits caused people to get sick.

I have a few points I disagree with you or at least, think that they a bit more complicated. Fake news is indeed a problem, and huge internet clusters are cultivating these perceptions based on confirmation bias. I think the obvious motivator to create this video was the recent elections, more specifically, the great divide between the left and right wings in the US. It is quite clear that certain pages like Tumblr or /r/politics are very liberal and other pages like 4chan feed on alt-right ideals. <br><br>It think that the idea that there are always &quot;facts&quot; in which we can agree upon is somewhat simplistic. Maybe it has to do with the fact that you are much more educated in the natural sciences and more social ones. I think the problem is that there are topics in which an absolute truth doesnt exist. Take for example the question &quot;Is it better to decrease or increase taxes?&quot;, the answer is depends, and the only way to answer it is weighting our values. In some contexts, the answer might be yes, in others no, not because they cant agree on the effects, but rather because it affects them in different ways. Humans dont only look at facts to take decisions, we have emotions, feelings that make our decisions unique. <br><br>Also, I think you underestimate the difficulty of presenting facts without leaving out biases, even if unintented. Say for for example, a situation in which a man kills another by cutting up his arms. There are several ways to present this fact. &quot;Man kills another man&quot;, &quot;Man dismembers other man&quot;, &quot;Man gets dismembered&quot;, etc... All of them present the same fact, with different emphasis and changes the tone of the fact. Just like the Wikipedia example you presented. Wikipedia is not truth. No doctor relies on it, because  most pages are outdated. Some articles have heavy bias for a particular worldview, some history articles are guilty of this, as they sometimes present specific schools of thought.<br><br>For this reason, the box idea has another flaw, other than the one you presented (which is we might be less inclined to change our opinions), and that is the existence of a &quot;better&quot; opinion. Of course, some opinions are &quot;caca&quot; and are not fundamented. But in some topics my opinion is as valid as yours and I believe that this is why the internet has not converged in this &quot;truth&quot;. Of course, there are certain things that get spread on the internet like the flat earth that are straight out inventions, but I think that the approach you are presenting is not the right path. <br><br>I personally think that the source of these fake news is the lack of accountability. I always cringe when even big news sources like CNN or BBC dont cite. Yes, they are sources that might need the anonymity, but it is quite clear in recent years that even big networks can straight out lie and no one is going to be held accountable. In the internet, this is even more serious. There are almost no way to know for certain who said something or who said first.

Yet an agitated mind is not open for new things. So an algorithm should prevent peaks by slowing down those messages, which are shared the most and rather enforce the &quot;meh&quot; messages. Of course people will try to circumvent this by deliberately writing unagitatedly, yet that would exactly be the desired outcome.

There was the commenter (in the video) who said that beliefs should be like paper in boxes, and we should be willing to replace our existing beliefs when we have information that renders them incorrect/flawed/moot. I agree with this idea very much, but I also agree with your statement that a lot of people either can&#39;t, or won&#39;t do this.<br><br>My wife actually did some research on this, and discovered that this phenomenon has a name: Cognitive Flexibility. People tend to fall into two groups: Cognitively Flexible, and Cognitively In-flexible. If you are cognitively flexible you are more able to replace the pieces of paper that make up your beliefs than those who are cognitively in-flexible. And this ability has nothing to do with intelligence, political leanings, or really any other socio-economic factor. As I said my wife did a fair amount of research on this, so I&#39;ll refer you to her blog (which contains additional sources and references):<br><br><a href=\"http://www.kyrackramer.com/2015/01/12/more-news-is-bad-news/\">http://www.kyrackramer.com/2015/01/12/more-news-is-bad-news/</a><br><br>The other aspect of this, which you hit on when you question whether or not its even a good idea to discuss or argue with others that have a different option, is the idea of Cognitive Dissonance, and what has become known as the Backfire Effect. If people are cognitively inflexible then providing information which contradicts their ideas is likely to case cognitive dissonance. This is actually a painful experience for a lot of people, and one of the reasons people say they have been &quot;attacked&quot; when presented with ideas that are different from their own. Whats more is that the more &quot;proof&quot; that you offer (in terms of references, statistics, sources, etc) the more you are personally attacking them. This is when backfire effect kicks in. People tend to react to this pain by becoming even more entrenched in the idea. And now, thanks to the internet, a quick search will instantly provide the confirmation bias that this person, wounded by your facts, so desperately craves.<br><br>The sad part about this is that I don&#39;t know how to solve this problem. If there are some people who are so physically and emotionally hurt by information that contradicts what they believe that they will lash out at the messenger, I don&#39;t know how to reach those people. Even if, as you suggest, the algorithms used by Facebook and Google are able to distinguish &quot;good&quot; and &quot;bad&quot; sources of information, people will still seek out the information that matches what they already believe. And then Facebook and Google become mouthpieces of the &quot;other&quot; so they will abandon them in favour of more &quot;honest&quot; sources.<br><br>I would like to think that there are some people that would look on this tendency as being bad, and therefore would try to encourage themselves to be more cognitively flexible. I&#39;m sure it happens, and I would love to figure out how to encourage people to make that shift.

I think this is definitely something that we need to discuss.<br>A couple quick points/suggestions/comments:<br>1) I&#39;d check out the book Thinking Fast and Slow by Daniel Kahneman. In that he talks about his theory of people having two different forms of thinking/process: System 1, and System 2. System 1 is more the quick thinking. Jumping to conclusion based on little information. Or, as you pointed out, the stuff that we repost quickly because it &quot;pushes our buttons&quot;. That is System 1 thinking. System 2 thinking is much more complex/difficult, and, as you stated, more &quot;mature&quot;. It is the System that looks at facts/information objectively. It considers information from a very skeptical mindset, regardless of the source/bias it has.<br><br>I think this could help explain some of the phenomena going on with this &quot;post-truth&quot; phase. LOTS of System 1 thinking, and very little System 2 thinking.<br><br>2) On one hand I do think it would be nice to come up with some sort of way to filter out the noise/misinformation so that only the truest information rises to the top. The only issue with that is it starts to feel more and more like censorship when you extend the logical process of that into the real world. As you stated, there are some people that just seem to not care about facts. Therefore, any censorship is likely to not harm these people, as they will likely find the fake/misleading information because it confirms their bias already. Censorship I think will only hurt those people that are actually trying to post the most factual information they can. It also puts a lot of faith in &quot;mainstream media&quot; to give us &quot;only factual&quot; information. As one of the students pointed out. Misinformation was pumped out by ALL media sources. So censoring the information, and giving kudos only to those sources &quot;someone&quot; deems appropriate/worthy is asking for trouble I think.<br><br>It also potentially would censor people who ARE posting factual information, but may not have the $$$ or head nod from those people in charge of what gets attention and what doesn&#39;t. What if someone starts up a blog where their information is much more factually based than even that of CNN, but they are running the site out of their basement.

But the Left(ish) were always\u00a0there to push back.Now they aren&#39;t.In some ways, this is good(ish) - &quot;Facts&quot; from the early 20th century said that women were inferior to men, that non-whites were inferior to whites, that Europe (and their white descendants/colonies) were unquestionably superior to everything else. And we had &quot;facts&quot; to back that up. IQ was higher in whites and white men in particular, for example. But these &quot;facts&quot; were horribly misleading, horribly biased and were arrived at in terrible ways (&quot;I&#39;m superior to that non-white guy, and I&#39;m going to show it by ... oh, he can&#39;t read? Literacy Test to show my IQ is higher than his!&quot; and &quot;I&#39;m good at math, and so this test which is all about math proves that I, a man, am superior to that woman, who cannot do math like this (yes she was never taught because we don&#39;t teach that kind of advanced math to women but that&#39;s because they&#39;re inferior to us so they can&#39;t do it anyway)!&quot; etc.) and so deserved and needed to be destroyed.Unfortunately when you create a system which can destroy &quot;Facts&quot; (like Post-Structuralism and Feminism), it&#39;s impossible to keep them from turning on other &quot;Facts&quot; and doing the same things to those &quot;facts&quot;. But when you destroy one fact, another generally has to take its place - and so you get things like the new definition of Racism, in which it is not merely &quot;Bias/Bigotry due to Race/Ethnicity.&quot; and becomes &quot;A System created by Whites to explain, justify and support the Slavery of Africans in the Americas.&quot; or &quot;Bias/Bigotry due to Race/Ethnicity + Power. (where Power is essentially Whiteness, as it is\u00a0difficult to find examples of people using this definition to call non-Whites &quot;Racists&quot;; this could be because most of these discussions are based on North America/USA/Europe/Australia, with a smattering of Israel and Southern Africa, and attempts to widen the discussion are normally considered to be diversionary tactics to avoid the &quot;uncomfortable topic&quot;.)The Right(ish) is always going to spin and deny and change to fit their needs.

I believe the world is slowly unraveling the primary philosophical differences between people, those more conservatively minded and those more liberally minded.

Conservatives, on the other hand, are more open minded to the good aspects of the things we already have. They are skeptical of change, not out of ignorance, but out of caution. <br><br>For this reason, it is very telling that liberally minded people want to change the systems, implement &quot;lie detector tests&quot; etc, whilst conservatively minded people would rather that we focus on developing individuals instead. Liberals are more likely to be materialistic and see things as just these deterministic systems, whilst conservatives are more likely to see things as chaotic manifestations of intentions, of beliefs and principles.<br><br>There are no real world solutions to this, unless a dystopia seems compelling.

The deeper you go down this rabbit hole, the more fascinating it is, what people are willing to do for and do to other people.<br><br>Another option is global warming, but there are two areas in the debate that are not transparent.

Climate change=bad<br><br>The story has to be more interesting than that.

Everyone is focused on treaties and this exactly where it should NOT be focused.   Read the Paris agreement.   Do you really think each country trying to meet nationally determined levels is going to drive the innovation needed to make a dent?     Everybody can feel good about meeting or exceeding a treaty goal, yet nothing will be accomplished.   Yay we met a CO2 production quota.   Now look at the cost.   What is the benefit, when large portions of the contribution are simply building things?<br><br>CO2 is an energy consumption issue.  Energy is the ability to do work, and has humans we do a LOT of work; in fact our physical frailty demands that we do a lot.   We have important variables that ARE actually human controllable:   the amount of work we do, and the efficiency with which that energy is transformed into work.    Generally speaking, the amount of work can never go down as the population rises and scarcity persists.   The way humans can control this is to resist scarcity, or embrace scarcity by controlling populations.      Monolithic systems to control population may &quot;work&quot; but they are antithetical to human values, namely individual sovereignty.<br><br>The other variable is efficiency.   Efficiency is almost entirely an engineering problem, as already we know the &quot;what&quot; the physics of what is happening already.  Treaties are not the way, in my OPINION, to invent technology or solve engineering problems.   State-contrived competition isn&#39;t the way either.    The best innovation comes with world class economies that have the resources to deliver world class education and world class research.    These things are built by embracing values of Liberty, Equality, and Fraternity.  And these are precisely values that can never be &quot;delivered&quot; by state authority.

They may check their numbers over and over again just to make sure they aren&#39;t mistaken.

Having very recently done an incredibly in-depth review of the literature on political polarization, I think there are a few issues here in terms of how its discussed but overall an excellent video. While it&#39;s not settled, mass political polarization doesn&#39;t appear to be really occurring in opinions, rather there is more of a tribal &quot;sorting&quot; and the terms Democrat/Republican and liberal/conservative haven&#39;t really grown further apart in ideology but become more important as an identity marker. They represent our tribes. The perceived polarization likely comes from the fact that since opinions aren&#39;t too different but dislike of the other side is higher, you get less trust and civility - or general empathy for understanding the perspective of the other side. Further, there are a few issues that have become more charged and we use them as symbols of which side we&#39;re on. Lastly, there is the fact that elite political polarization appears to be real. There are numerous suspected causes but there really doesn&#39;t seem to be anything super definitive as to the reason.

Here&#39;s part of an explaination of these (I&#39;m sure non-original) ideas:<br><br>Lack of originality: If you think you had an original idea, and you look it up, it takes literally seconds before you realize it wasn&#39;t original at all. In the old days, those ideas would perhaps have flourished and become something important (perhaps entirely different than other ideas after all). That it later turned out that others had the same ideas, only substantiated them as facts. Today, those ideas never even get a chance, because you &#39;know&#39; someone has beat you to it, so &quot;there&#39;s no point&quot;. <br><br>People have to give up the idea that everything they do and say, have to be original. We should value information based on other things, than on how we could use it to get confirmation from others. The way we get facts is by having alot of people considering the same things as their own ideas, and thinking about them in a rational manner. Today, when &#39;noone&#39; alone, can be truly original, the next best thing is to become part of a group that shares the idea among them. Before you made this video, you probably had a feeling (perhaps at a subconscious level) that part of these thoughts were original. Sure, you had read/seen others talk about similar things, but not exactly like this. There are mainly three ways to react to someone else saying something that you felt, partly, was &#39;your own thoughts&#39;: 1.)  To go: &quot;Oh, great, I thought it was only me, this partly confirms my beliefs&quot;, 2.) To become jealous and argue that the ideas has been around forever and are not original at all (which is often true, even if you don&#39;t know that), 3.) Claim the idea as your own, and/or become part of a group that unwillingly shares the idea.<br><br>Lack of curiosity: Part of the answer to your last question could also perhaps be over information as a cause of lack of curiosity. To actually care about facts you need to be curious. If you know (think) you have access to any information, at any time, a lot of the curiosity disappears. <br><br>The internet has expanded the market place of ideas, for good and bad. I do really think it&#39;s mostly for good, but of course &#39;bad&#39; ideas can have as much room as &#39;good&#39; ones. When we can give up part of the race to be that person that told that yoke, had that idea, made that song, wrote that original comment in the comments section to that original video (well...), then everyone could perhaps care more about truth.", "comment_date": "2016-12-22T11:58:56Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "NotAnUndercoverCop", "comment_text": "Don&#39;t scroll down, you don&#39;t want to subject yourself to the sheer idiocy you&#39;ll see.

They just don&#39;t know what the truth is anymore.<br><br>Consider the trend of tribalization you were talking about and take it to its logically absurd conclusion: a large number of tribes of 1-3 people. Since not everybody can be a journalist, the vast majority of these tribes will be getting their news and &quot;truth&quot; from a different tribe. The rational strategy for this situation is skeptisicm; &quot;they aren&#39;t in our tribe, so why should I trust what they say?&quot; Each tribe will be deeply suspicious of the truths coming from other tribes, even the &quot;professional journalists&quot; in other tribes, unless they have some other reason to believe what they&#39;re hearing.<br><br>But the best &#39;other reason&#39; is that what you&#39;re reading aligns with something you already believed in. This will exacerbate the confirmation bias. And since each tribe is both suspicious and highly susceptible to confirmation bias, this is like a positive feedback loop where both your suspicions and suspicion itself are repeatedly confirmed and deepened with each piece of news your read. In the end, the only people you think you can trust are the people who are presenting the world as the worst possible extrapolation of the suspicions you started with.<br><br>This is why fake news not only springs into existence and spreads, but why people believe it and don&#39;t believe the fact checkers. Why should you believe somebody who claims to be a &quot;fact checker&quot; from another tribe? They&#39;re probably just spreading lies for some sinister plot to destroy your tribe. You have literally no way to know. <br><br>What is the solution here? Reverse the tribalization. Integrate the tribes. Get rid of &quot;us vs. them&quot; by combining &quot;them&quot; into &quot;us.&quot; And how do we do that? On an individual level, we have to start by ceasing to think of our political opposites as adversaries, as morally bankrupt, or as evil or selfish. We have to try to reframe them in what is undoubtedly a more accurate light: that they are humans, just like us. Humans who largely care about and want the same things, like a decent life, dignity, security and prosperity for their children, to feel proud of who they are, to have meaningful connections to others, and to be remembered fondly. When you understand that the people in other tribes are actually just like you, you break down your tribal barrier just a little bit.<br><br>The next step is to reach out and rebuild credibility and trust. Bridges are much easier to knock down than they are to build, and we have been knocking them down for many decades now. It&#39;s time to reverse the trend. Form social connections with people you disagree with (online and in person), encourage a diversity of opinion and make it clear that you will respect others&#39; opinions, and yes, maybe let some more contentious issues fall to the wayside for a while until the social fabric is in a better state. <br><br>And we also need institutional change. We have been structuring our institutions to encourage individualism and tribalization, but we need to alter them to foster community and consensus. Instead of promoting personalizations that sort people into niches, we need our online networks to promote universals that align people&#39;s interests. Instead of making it easier to isolate yourself from dissenting views, our social networks should encourage such interactions. <br><br>And nothing beats face to face contact. Instead of creating more fun things to do at home by yourself, we need to create interesting ways to get out, connect with your community, and encounter other people. One idea that might go a long way would be a national service program, which could both find useful activities for people out of work and promote working alongside people unlike ourselves. <br><br>People will always care about the truth.

The value of a commodity entirely dependent upon the demand that is created by the consumers (That is the observers / viewers in this case). What is exactly is the mix that creates the demand for a commodity ? <br><br>The answer to this question is probably in the emotion of the observer rather than the quantitative OR qualitative value of the commodity. Any commodity that creates or brings out any kind of emotion that can be related to by majority of the population wins the cost battle. A good example here is the value &amp; usefulness of Gold VS Iron. Gold has limited uses than that of Iron but, it&#39;s value is more than that of Iron. I understand that gold is rare &amp; iron is too common but there&#39;s also an emotional value attached to gold. The hype in the cost of gold is actually the cost of emotions attached to it rather than the actual use. <br><br>NEWS that is manufactured is carefully stitched together to trigger certain positive or negative emotions among the masses. Same thing can be observed with pics with motivational quotes, humor &amp; some negative emotions as well. Any commodity that brings out common emotions that everyone is aware / feel on a daily basis wins this battle of popularity. <br><br>Knowledge on the other hand brings out some really complex emotions. Sometimes These emotions are a bit heavy to handle and that&#39;s why overlooked by most. I mean even when we learn something new we do not realize / feel it&#39;s value unless you put it into practice to create something. Same is the thing about facts, things need to be established &amp; defined for something to become a fact.

Thus, the fact that we have developed an intelligence, a capacity for reasoning, is due to that fact that this development has increased our chances of survival and reproduction. So from the point of view of evolution the main aim of our brain is not the search of truth. The search for truth is sort of an &quot;inevitable side effect&quot; of the evolution of our intelligence: sure our chances of success are higher if we base our reasoning on truthful facts. But then again, some facts are favorable to our interests and some are not, and whenever we face some unpleasant fact or idea we will instinctively try to reject it. Our opinions are biased by our very nature. If we analyze anybody&#39;s opinion on any subject, how often do we encounter somebody who&#39;s opinion is clearly against his interests? Just watch on television some street survey. How often does the answer &quot;I don&#39;t know&quot; show up? Very seldom. If it is a question that we never gave a thought before we immediately switch to the part of our brain that gives us the answer we would like to be true.

People no longer hold and assess information and ideas.  They simply look for similar patterns of writing or speaking, and re-read them.  Look at people who watch Star Wars for the 13th time, or read the same Bible passages every day.  This is a kind of &quot;echo chamber&quot;.   Facts are things that exist outside of emotional feedback loops designed by mathematical algorithms that can easily can easily track your emotional state.   You give your emotional state to FB/TW/INST by how quickly you scroll past, and what you hover on, with the highest value placed to what to respond to.  It has already been done where your emotional life, the way you think, what you like and don&#39;t like, what will make you respond, are all part of the end user agreement you signed to use any social media.   So then what are facts?  Facts in this contexts are only things that can exist in this self-reflective world.  A fact is only something that creates greater interaction on your part with the social media algorithm that is tracking you.  Those are the only facts that actually exist in Social Media Universe.  In reality land, there is calculus, electromagnetism, quantum mechanics, gravity, chemistry, biology, materials science, engineering and on.   One lofty goal of these sciences was to be able to detect the human soul.  But these are approximations to Outdoor Offline Reality, with no applicability to Online Reality.  There is no restriction in any game universe that demands that all laws of physics must be obeyed.  Therefore, anything that can be programmed or imagined is, in fact, a reality.  Or at least an Online Reality.  Online Realities do not have to care about the real world. This is why so many Stein and Johnson supporters were so unwilling to vote &quot;against their morals&quot; by voting for Clinton.  In the Online Reality, she was a devil with horns and numerous videos to prove it.  But in reality world, she was a much better manager than the current president-elect will ever be.  This means that Online Reality&#39;s imaginary (and rightfully so) universe with supra-flexible rules, or even non-existent ones, or where you could find an information &quot;cul-de-sac&quot; and deliberately isolate your discourse to those who agreed with you.  This meant that the action of actually stepping outside, and talking to real people has for the most part stopped happening.  As for the mathematics of it, we can look at &quot;echo chambers&quot; as stable vortices in an information current.  The information does carry truth or falsehood until it meets a vortex or chamber.  Then it is evaluated based on the conditions in that chamber.  If it&#39;s acceptable, the vortex spins it up and sends it further downstream, thus energy is imparted to the packet of information and it is able to reach other vortices or chambers, where it is further amplified.  Veracity with respect to external laws, whether physical or societal or governmental, are completely ignored.   Think of the raving lunatic who never shuts up no matter what you say or do.  In the Offline Outdoor Reality, such a person would eventually become physically and socially isolated.  They would then be forced either to  change their behavior or to stay isolated.  If they somehow managed to leave the physical location where their interactions were no appreciated, they inevitably went deeper into isolation unless they found willing listeners, but this would be rare.   So, Outdoor Offline Reality has natural checks and balances against fake news: the bearer was mad and not to be trusted.  Online Reality starts only with a pleasing meme and photo-philosophy.  Neither are developed.  The only facts Online are those that create the most reactions.  Reactions are therefore the facts, not the content.  Content is merely the object that either creates a reaction or does not.   This long response is of course proof that information packets must be assessed by something.  The only true method to eliminate fake news online is to disengage.  By disengaging from fake news and seeking out knowledgable experts who have studied things and actually mastered them enough to reason out their arguments without a google search is the only path away.  In order to stop the fake news, you have to stop its flow.  There is only one way to stop its flow.  Disengage from all Online Reality and return to Outdoor Reality.

Facebook doesn&#39;t exist to share good information.  It exists to generate advertising revenue.  Advertisers don&#39;t care whether people are reading fake news or not, they care about whether they see their ads, and their ads aren&#39;t even associated with that fake news directly anyways, they just want more eyes on Facebook, and a good way to know people are paying attention is that they are commenting on content that makes them angry.<br><br>This is why google doesn&#39;t have the same problem.  Google wants to show useful information.  It doesn&#39;t care whether you get angry enough to leave a message, it just wants you to find what you&#39;re looking for in the first page.  That&#39;s got some downsides as well, but at least it&#39;s working as a service for the user to an extent.  Facebook is the opposite, they are aren&#39;t trying to give anything to the user, they&#39;re trying to make the user do something.  <br><br>I don&#39;t know that we can stop it, not yet.

News sites whose agenda you agree with are more dangerous to you than those with opposing views. You are skaptical of Breitbart news, that&#39;s good! However, you more blindly trust CNN and so when they deliver news in a way skewed in favor of neoliberalism you don&#39;t recognize the bias.

And I&#39;ll tell you why, and what you can do about it. <br><br>(Note: I won&#39;t comment on your politics, just argue against what you&#39;ve said. That said, this will be a LONG comment.) <br><br>The moment you assigned &quot;searching for science videos / The Truth&quot; to a virtue (the premise of your video), you stopped speaking in terms of objective truth. You&#39;ve made a moral claim. That too with &quot;CNN is more likely to be true than Breitbart&quot;, which is based on a hunch, a personal judgment (I&#39;m refraining from saying &#39;bias&#39; here), rather than something that can be accepted as &quot;objectively true&quot;. <br><br>You&#39;re also partaking in black-and-white thinking to believe that ideologues are the only ones that &quot;reject the facts&quot;. You&#39;d be hard-pressed to find a reasonable religious person today that is far more anti-science than a more politically leaning atheist, even if they aren&#39;t ideologues. Sometimes even PC Egalitarians would much rather waver away objective reality simply because it&#39;s &quot;morally right to deny it&quot; \u2014 even IF they claim to support science, rationality, skepticism and (in your words) &quot;The Truth&quot;. After all, it&#39;s not always that a person&#39;s explicit claim matches with their implicit behavior, but there&#39;s always the rationalization \u2014 the &quot;making excuses&quot; \u2014 that tries to cover that dissonance. <br><br>As much as we&#39;d all like to be rational (or even claim to be rational), human beings aren&#39;t inherently rational, and that taints how we think and behave. Sometimes that&#39;s a blessing, sometimes that&#39;s a curse. But if anything, this at least introduces some diversity of thought, which can be hashed out in discussions. <br><br>Forget the fact that even sciences are often fractured in staunch disagreements, the polarization (while severe, I agree) at least demonstrates people&#39;s willingness to disagree with you \u2014 to the point countless conservatives are willing to watch your entire video and leave criticism for you. One would expect that sort of engagement from modern Liberals and Progressives, since they claim to be pro-science, but unfortunately those latter two would rather block you for merely disagreeing (presumably after concluding you&#39;re racist or something). <br><br>But you don&#39;t seem to be fine with that. By making &quot;consuming TRUE news&quot; as a virtue, and claiming that social media / search engines&#39; algorithms ought to be tweaked in a way it filters out what&#39;s false, you&#39;ve again made it into a moral question about what people SHOULD be consuming according to you. That too without any foresight of just how easy it would be to re-assign certain political beliefs as true and others as false, which may polarize the masses even further. Did I mention about various Facebook and Twitter censorship on partisan grounds? Especially since there&#39;s just no way to automate fact-checking things that can&#39;t even MANUALLY be recognized as objectively true or false? <br><br>But let&#39;s say that won&#39;t happen, and the algorithm somehow magically does exactly what you want it to: <br><br>You&#39;re making an argument for people to be &quot;spoon-fed&quot; what you believe to be rue. Even if everything you feed them IS true, it doesn&#39;t make them intelligent. Quite the opposite: It makes them intellectually lazy. No amount of rigorous logic mechanism will fix that. <br><br>You&#39;re also making an argument for people agreeing with each other, rather than hash out their disagreements. What you&#39;re essentially asking for is intellectual homogeneity, where everyone is under a single bubble and nobody should complain. <br><br>You&#39;re also asking for &quot;Control&quot; of information in what you regarded as &quot;Free&quot; Internet culture. That will have more negative outcomes than positive ones. <br><br>I agree that, when you follow the money, you&#39;ll likely find Facebook and other platforms feeding you things you already agree with (probably based on what you &quot;liked&quot; and giving you more things like it), and that&#39;s a problem. But it&#39;s that algorithm itself that&#39;s the problem here. It creates bubbles where there shouldn&#39;t be. <br><br>Fake News has been around since forever. As the Youtuber known as Sargon of Akkad says, &quot;If there&#39;s one thing mainstream media is good at it&#39;s reporting facts \u2014 if it wants to. Perhaps the greatest sin of the mainstream media is lying by omission, and everyone is aware of this.&quot; So if you desire your audience to benefit intellectually, would you rather lazily feed them fun-facts as if they&#39;re children, or have them learn to rigorously research on their own by reading 5 to 6 newspapers from different sources to piece together facts and recognize misinformation? <br><br>And since you rightly recognized that sometimes arguing with a person might entrench them deeper into their beliefs (The Backfire Effect), should it not then be in your best interest to TEACH people to analytically break away from being enslaved by their own such compulsions? Essentially building their personality? <br><br>Food for thought.<br><br>The guy at <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dvk2PQNcg8w&amp;t=17m41s\">17:41</a> is correct, by the way.

Emotions will always trump facts or education in general (and when I refer to &quot;education&quot; I mean the ability to check references, sources and to form the best educational guess after doing enough research on ones own). This will become a larger problem the further people get away from the educational system (for obvious reasons: its more &quot;difficult&quot; or its becoming too expensive which is a massive problem imo) and choose to live their lives based on beliefs (bias, stereotyping, prejudice etc) because its the &quot;easier&quot; route. It gives quick easy answer which people can relate too much better than doing research and then constructing an informed decision. Humans are innately lazy just as physics (we will tend to take the path of least resistance). People want EASY answers to extremely HARD problems that may not even have an answer to begin with (which makes people even more uncomfortable) such as in  politics or religion. I can relate to Veritasium very well, because I&#39;ve always wanted to understand the truth in anything (and one of the best starting points is to try understand the universe). But when you think about it, not too many people have that drive we share. Its harder and harder to find people like that in general. Look at religion.

Anyone who believes CNN, CBS or any other major news organization vetted Clinton with the dame tenacity as Trump is kidding themselves - I would argue had CNN done their jobs as &quot;curious&quot; journalists (especially during the primaries) they would have known things like Clinton used a private email server to distribute classified documents or had lied to the public about the cause of the Benghazi terrorist attacks.  Had the mainstream media done its job (as opposed to letting the Russians do it for them) the D party may have had a different more qualified candidate on the ticket. <br><br>As an example if you search CNN&#39;s site for &quot;Clinton Emails deleted&quot; you get 1686 hits only one story on the main page was actually about Clinton and it claims what we know is false (no work related emails were destroyed).  When you search for the truth about whether Clinton&#39;s server was scrubbed you get 765 hits - none of the top hits even discuss the fact that Clinton aides destroyed servers (or what is referred to as interfering with an ongoing FBI investigation if the candidate happens to have an R after their name).   <br><br>Most of us can spot fake news from 500 paces - and even if you confront people about it they just call you a name and move along in ignorance.

CNN is pretty well &quot;at the bottom of the dung pile&quot; of globalist owned and operated propaganda mills - which are the ACTUAL &quot;fake news sites!&quot; They&#39;ve been caught intentionally putting out entirely false information too many times to even be able to keep track of, ranging from having their cameraman pose as an interview subject; doing phony interviews (one which comes to mind was of a split screen, supposively in 2 totally different places, with the exact same vehicles passing behind them); and, being caught routinely playing &quot;snip and splice&quot;  with interviews, to make them seem as though something TOTALLY different was being said. If a story doesn&#39;t &quot;fit their agenda,&quot; it&#39;s quite often totally ignored. The leading independent news media (such as InfoWars, DrudgeReport, Breitbart, etc.) has to hold itself to a MUCH higher standard of fact-checking and documentation; and, have become the only resources for obtaining REAL news. Personally, I prefer the InfoWars format; and, over the past 10+ years, I&#39;ve spent a lot of fact-checking much of the information I&#39;ve gotten there. Even though the &quot;MSM&quot; tries to villainize InfoWars, the source material (including DOD, .mil, UN, CFR, etc. source documents, EO&#39;s, speeches and biographies) has never failed to check-out as being factually reported. Unfortunately, way too many people are just plain lazy and prefer to be followers. They choose to think what they&#39;re told to think; and, believe what they&#39;ve been conditioned to believe. At 19, I was an idiot, who ridiculed those who were trying to wake people up to what was going on; but, just watching events unfold over the past 40+ years since then woke me up to the folly of that 19 year old idiot.

The answer to this question is because we can be. There will be more detail later but for the short version; we now live in a world where we can pick and choose what we associate ourselves with and what we listen to. We live in a world where a person has the option to not listen to the other side.

Right?&quot; Wrong. The internet is the world at your fingertips, but there is no way for a single human to consume the entire world. (I&#39;m ending this bad metaphor now.) Because a person will never in his/her individual lifetime see/read the entirety of the internet individuals will end up picking and choosing what parts of the internet they see/read.

You continue on to mention that other more agenda driven niches can gather together as well as if it were unexpected. How did you not see that niche markets would expand whilst being within an expanding niche market?<br><br><a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dvk2PQNcg8w&amp;t=4m00s\">4:00</a> You start talking about other communities and then shine a negative light upon communties with an ideological or religious or just biased agenda.

Second, by referring to certain groups as people with differing ideologies you are admitting that you have your own ideology that you are trying to put on top; this wouldn&#39;t be pertinent if you didn&#39;t just shine a negative light upon having an ideological agenda. Finally by using the word intolerant as a pejorative you yourself are being intolerant. You are acting as if your niche gathering together is a good thing while the other niche gathering together is a bad thing, but it&#39;s not tolerance if you agree with something.<br><br>The next minute or so where you describe the evolution of internet ideas I have not a single qualm with.<br><br><a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dvk2PQNcg8w&amp;t=5m40s\">5:40</a> You say that when you think about two groups on the internet debating they&#39;re not really debating each other but what they think each other thinks. I want to disagree with this statement outright. I&#39;d say that when you think about two groups on the internet debating they are not debating each other but debating the worst from within each other. For example moderate conservatives will debate about regressive leftist while moderate liberals will debate about the alt-right. It isn&#39;t that they are making up lies about each other, but that they are taking the minority and projecting that image upon the majority. Basically it is ideological stereotyping.<br><br><a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dvk2PQNcg8w&amp;t=6m30s\">6:30</a> You partially credit the polarization to this evolution of malice within internet debates. I completely disagree. I return back to the buffet analogy. This would be like the meat eaters and the vegetarians fighting at a buffet when before they had to eat whatever they were given at a restaurant. (Think Japanese restaurant where they don&#39;t make exceptions.)<br><br><a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dvk2PQNcg8w&amp;t=6m35s\">6:35</a> You talk about algorithms promoting what is most engaged with. I don&#39;t disagree, (It would be stupid to deny evident fact.) but I think you&#39;re applying this wrong. I don&#39;t think that it is people creating charactures of their opponents and that ends up getting engaged with, but I do think that it is people are more likely to engage with extremism. I propose that people are more likely to engage with extremism because it is easier to do. When engaging with extremism there isn&#39;t a need for nuance, but when engaging a moderate stance nuance and finese is necessary.<br><br><a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dvk2PQNcg8w&amp;t=8m00s\">8:00</a> You say that we care less about facts than we ever have before. I think this is just false. In another comment I notice you mention that the collective we cannot agree on if there were illegal immigrants voting in our election. The collective we wouldn&#39;t be arguing about this potential fact if we didn&#39;t care about facts. The problem is that we cannot agree on what is factual or not, but the collective we still cares what is fact or not.<br><br><a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dvk2PQNcg8w&amp;t=8m15s\">8:15</a> We&#39;re all based on confirmation bias you say? Please then explain those people who actively seek out differing views from their own in order to grow in knowledge, and those people who practice intelectual humility. But at the end of it all I think what you&#39;re trying to say is that the collective we tends toward confirmation bias, which I don&#39;t disagree with.<br><br><a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dvk2PQNcg8w&amp;t=8m40s\">8:40</a> ~ish We need to overcome this division and agree on what is truth and what is not.

IRONICALLY, this video is just as &quot;fake&quot; as any &quot;fake news&quot; story that you claim is swaying the truth in our society -- as though lies never existed before this year. In the U.S. election, people were going to vote for whoever they had decided to vote for long before. Younger adults primarily voted for Clinton, and older ones voted for Trump. If &quot;fake news&quot; were such an issue, don&#39;t you think that the younger adults, who are more technologically involved, would have been skewed more (toward Trump)?<br><br>I mean, when did your word become anything more than a channel for laypeople about science anyway? Now you want to have an opinion about everything, and you want everyone to believe that you hold the same authority on those subjects too. You once did a video about how Galileo was censored by the Catholic Church, which completely misrepresented reality. Am I to come to a consensus (aka, blindly agree) with you about that, even if it&#39;s wrong?<br><br>Here&#39;s the actual yet concise version of what happened with Galileo:<br>At the time that Galileo adopted the idea of heliocentrism, mostly supported and made known 60 years earlier by Copernicus, little more than a dozen other established scientists held to this belief; that is to say, it was not very popular or even well supported. FURTHERMORE, &quot;following the death of Copernicus and before Galileo, heliocentrism was relatively uncontroversial;&quot; AND &quot;Copernicus&#39;s work was used by Pope Gregory XIII to reform the calendar in 1582.&quot; After the initial controversy of Galileo and his pupils espousing heliocentrism as fact, Cardinal Robert Bellarmine sympathetically spoke with Galileo, and &quot;found no problem with heliocentrism so long as it was treated as a purely hypothetical calculating device [because it wasn&#39;t well supported] and not as a physically real phenomenon... unless it could be conclusively proved through current scientific standards.&quot; However, Galileo wished to be able to publish his arguments regardless. Galileo also academically debated Monsignor Francesco Ingoli in 1616. Ingoli then sent Galileo an essay that &quot;included four theological arguments, but suggested to Galileo that he focus on the physical and mathematical arguments. Galileo did not write a response to Ingoli until 1624...&quot; Getting a better picture here? Because Galileo&#39;s work was believed not to be sufficiently supported, he and his pupils were ordered to stop teaching it as fact. Galileo ignored this order and the first inquisition was brought against him. &quot;In 1623, Pope Gregory XV, died, and was succeeded by Pope Urban VIII, who showed greater favor to Galileo.&quot; In 1632, Galileo published &quot;Dialogue Concerning the Two Chief World Systems,&quot; which gained popularity for his position. However, the book was also widely thought to mock the pope. This ultimately led to the second inquisition, Galileo&#39;s books being banned, and his indefinite house arrest. Again, in hindsight, it&#39;s easy to say that the Church was wrong and that Galileo should have been permitted to teach whatever he wanted in whatever way he wanted, and he was for the most part. Galileo simply decided to disregard the Church and teach things that, at the time, were deemed unsubstantiated and potentially heretical. <br><br>IRONICALLY (yet again), all of this information is widely available on the internet, but in your video about Galileo, the Church, and censorship, you left it at &quot;the Church wanted to censor Galileo because his ideas of heliocentrism went against the Bible, and so he was banned and placed under house arrest for the remainder of his life.&quot; If I wanted that depiction of history, I&#39;d go back to middle school.<br><br>Just realize how backward your thinking is on all matters not science (and even some politically motivated science topics, i.e. climate change) when it comes to creating Youtube content.

Because someone&#39;s analysis of the raw data leads them to a different conclusion when you&#39;re talking about public policy doesn&#39;t mean they don&#39;t know the facts or that you have some indisputable claim on them. <br><br>Cherry picking here to make a point admittedly, but lets talk about climate change. FACT (raw data, no bias):core records show the Earth&#39;s climate changes and has always changed at periodic intervals. FACT: CO2 is a greenhouse gas because short wave length radiation passes thru while longer wave length radiation is reflected FACT:Modern civilization releases CO2 gases into the atmosphere (I&#39;d say ALOT but that would be a normative statement and trying to stick to factual statements for this part), therefore human civilization releases greenhouse gases into the atmosphere which, baring another absorbtion factors and other reflectors, can affect the amount of longer wave length radiation trapped in the ecosystem causing a heat forcing. Yes, these are all facts. <br><br>However the leap from there to &#39;we should go back to hunting/gathering&#39; gets much more murky. Even the IPCC reports don&#39;t give exact figures, but probability distributions. They say it&#39;s &#39;likely&#39; (a value statement representing a range between 66% and 100% probability) that the average temperature will rise by 1.5C relative to the 50 year average between 1850 and 1900 (even picking that specific time frame to make comparisons is already interjecting bias into the disucssion. Not necessarily BAD bias mind you, but its a human choice to make that the median value, not some abstract &#39;truth&#39;) for MOST scenarios. It also estimates that the likely global economic impact from a rise of 2.0C in temperature would be about 0.2 to 2.0% of global income. There&#39;s also the conclusion that while sea level rises, contrary to scare hype science fiction like The Day After Tomorrow, it doesn&#39;t happen all at once.  A sea level rise of 10 feet over the course of 100 years is not immediately catastrophic (FACT again: humans have historically been very migratory when faced with dwindling resources and/or inhospitible living conditions). You can take those points and make a rational argument that the cost to modern living (mobility, access to health care, income, access to food) isn&#39;t worth (value statement) the cost of doing what would be necessary to stop the anthropogenic forcings. I&#39;m not saying you should AGREE with it, again, that&#39;s based on YOUR value set.

Why? Some of it is due shorter attention spans but a lot of it is due to education. For as rich as the U.S. is it&#39;s kids are some of the dumbest fuckers on the planet. 8) Psychology is a hell of a drug.

What I am getting at is even fact-checking can be difficult, and sources that used to be commonly accepted at face value have been found to be perpetrating lies or partial truths (for example, CNN, who have been caught passing off photographs of things that were taken years earlier as recent photos, or political rallies like the DNC paying people to come out and act like supporters at rallies, so that they look well-supported on camera). It is often difficult to get at the truth, when even traditional sources cannot be trusted. We must remember that in matters of truth, the opinions of ten thousand are worth less than the sound reasoning of a single individual, combined with empirical evidence. It&#39;s the evidence that is hard to come by, and news has different standards of evidence than scientists.

Derek, you mention confirmation bias; however, this is just one of many issues contributing to the problem, and the problems you are lamenting are nothing new.<br><br>Just go back within the last 100 years and look at the amount of propaganda that has been generated not just by the media, but by the governments themselves - twisting facts and mongering fear and hate to further their own cause. The only difference in this case is the media by which this occurs.<br><br>If you are going to try to filter out &quot;fake&quot; news, it needs to be complemented by public education. The university I went to focused very heavily on developing critical thinking and self-reflection skills in its students, but what of those who never go to uni? What education is there for the &quot;average Joe&quot; out there, to help them become better at intellectual discourse? Until that is addressed, you&#39;re going to be fighting an uphill battle.<br><br>One of the things that troubles me about our western education system is the tendency to spoon-feed &quot;knowledge&quot; to students. Because of the mass-production factory-line process we use, there is no time to let our children explore and make meaning for themselves - to think critically and discerningly. This carries on into adulthood. Western society is very heavily guilty of &#39;spoon-feeding&#39;, and this, I believe, has only added to the problem you describe.<br><br>Another problem I see with the argument in this video is referral to the &quot;truth&quot; and &quot;facts&quot;. For a start, we don&#39;t even have a consensus in society as to what truth is. Any discussion about truth has to deal with the definition of truth, and its nature.<br><br>Are we now trying to establish an absolute, or are we working on the premise that &quot;truth&quot; is just &quot;what we know to be true&quot;? On one hand you have &quot;reality&quot; forcing opinions to conform to it; on the other hand, you have opinions and beliefs forcing &quot;reality&quot; to conform to them. If we do put truth as an absolute, who gets to define it, and why should any person accept that truth, just because somebody says it&#39;s the truth?<br><br>Do we really know the truth, and if we answer yes to that question, then how do we know it&#39;s really truth? Even science admits that its entire body of laws and theories are just &quot;man&#39;s best estimation of reality, based on what we have observed and can measure.&quot; Theories and laws, based on data. Are these truth?<br><br>What about facts? In your discussion, you link &quot;truth&quot; to &quot;facts&quot;. Well, in the realm of statistics and computer science, data is defined as &quot;numbers, facts, and figures.&quot; Facts are data, and on their own, data have no real meaning to them. For example, If I handed you a piece of paper covered in numbers, that would give you no information; however, if I told you that those numbers were the season scores for a particular sporting team or player, well then it becomes meaningful. It&#39;s not until we give data meaning that it becomes information. The issue here is that we - humans - give meaning to data. We interpret it and analyse it through the lenses of our current understandings and beliefs, and come up with ideas, theories and laws based on that. The problem is, this becomes a circular process. We refine our theories and laws based on our analysis and interpretation of data, but the way we handle that data is based in our accepted body of theories, laws and ideologies.<br><br>I&#39;ll give an example. There are many who cite religion as being &quot;anti-science&quot;; but really, science is just a method. It&#39;s a way of doing things. It&#39;s a process of observation, measurement and experimentation that generates data. What you&#39;re dealing with in the argument of religion versus science is really a clash of worldviews: the religious worldviews and the naturalistic / humanistic worldviews. Both see the same evidence, but the different worldviews interpret it differently, based on their own beliefs, theories and ideologies. The same evidence generates different conclusions, but who is right, and who is wrong? What is the truth, and how do we know it&#39;s the truth? <br><br>This is where we come back to the issue of &quot;false news&quot;. At its core, news is just data - facts, figures, numbers. The problem we run into is that different agencies give that data different meaning (based on whatever agendas and motives govern them) and then transmit that information on to other people. Even if just the raw data - the facts and figures - are given, people will still give that data meaning based on their own beliefs and opinions. That&#39;s what humans do.<br><br>The key, I believe, is firstly to bring accountability back to journalism - they are there to report on the facts. No bias, no spin, no twisting to present a particular picture to its audience. Secondly, people need to be educated in the discipline of critical thinking and self-reflection - and understanding that having beliefs challenged is not a personal attack, but an opportunity to grow. If you were able to achieve these things, then the audience for fake news and propaganda would virtually disappear, and if few to none take it seriously anymore, then it will eventually die out. Really, in my opinion, the best algorithm for weeding out false news is us. To get machines to do the job for us just exacerbates the problem, and doesn&#39;t deal with the core issues.<br><br>Just my thoughts.

Google is not a social being; Facebook is.    All social interaction is variation.<br><br>Also, think of the bell shaped curve.   There is this wide, tall middle, where whatever &quot;facts&quot; or science or knowledge aren&#39;t going to affect the way people, think, what they think about, or what they discover with that information.   But for the outliers, that information will lead to advancements in theory and experiment.  And thanks to the internet, that information reaches GAZILLIONS of outliers, moreso than in any past history.  And that is good.   Physics has had a handful of rock-stars, and back in the early 20th century, but a handful of groupies.   Now there are whole populations and cultures that can entertain quantum phenomenon, which never would have even heard of them.

Sure in the days of Morrow, Brinkley, and Cronkite we might&#39;ve thought that &quot;journalism&quot; was above opinion.

We can point to numerous contributing factors that result in the rejection of facts. I see 4 areas that seem like low-hanging fruit: Disagreement on the definition of what a fact is, The social stigma of being &quot;wrong&quot;, The media&#39;s inability to communicate with a broader audience, and sensitivity to political correctness. <br><br>It&#39;s difficult to define what a fact is when science is widely accepted, but not totally accepted. Some people reject scientific findings, and sometimes with good reason. Reporting findings has become so diluted with pseudoscience and over-excited headlines...people have become skeptical of the process all together. As you pointed out, a lot of people don&#39;t have the time or patience to do their own fact checking. So, when that becomes a burden, why not just reject the scientific practice all together? Then, you have people who choose faith over fact. Not just religious faith, but faith in their own ideas and perception. To assume that conclusive scientific evidence equates to a fact is naive. <br><br>From grade school and on, we compete for the imaginary trophy of &quot;being right&quot;. We&#39;re punished with red marks, poor grades, parental discipline, and bullying when we stumble into the realm of inaccuracy. We&#39;re taught that being wrong means that we&#39;re a bad person, or maybe we don&#39;t measure up to the arbitrary standards society has set for us. Adopting new and better ideas sounds simple enough. However, that triggers and emotional response instead of a logical response...which leads to anger, and anger leads to hate, and hate leads to the dark side. <br><br>When it comes to reporting news, many media outlets rely on the easy task of simply reporting facts (sometimes). For a lot of people, facts are recognized, registered, and committed to memory. We can&#39;t stop there though... Reporting need charisma, it needs a brand, it needs trust, and it needs an emotional connection. This &quot;post-fact&quot; wave emerged from people who believe what feels good, what&#39;s funny, what&#39;s dramatic, and what fits their ideals. I would challenge more media outlets to reach this audience with real information in an engaging way the same way Bill Nye did. Comedy, theatrics, and narrative go a long way towards reaching broad audiences. <br><br>Political correctness extends far beyond name calling and words that make us feel uncomfortable. PC has morphed into this idea that we should stop conversations that people might be sensitive about because of their personal beliefs and feelings. Some people choose comfort over learning, which is perfectly reasonable. However, when this idea extends to classrooms...well...

Yes, there are very specific statements that are false in certain news stories, but at the same time there is news which can be very misleading without containing a single false statement. Singling out just the type of news that is overtly fake as something less moral than the more covert type of fake news, and therefore something that must be acted upon, is not a very good argument. Furthermore, with regard to social networks, these are all private companies and we have no right to decide the way they promote content. If people want the top items in their news feed to be the articles shared by their friends, or the most liked articles or the most-discussed, then social networks will respond to that by pushing the news to the top of the feed. It is a way  to keep users engaged and feel that they are up to date with whatever&#39;s &quot;hot&quot; at the moment. The fact that we (or some of us) have come up with this &quot;moral obligation&quot; to fight &quot;fake&quot; news through forcing private companies to change their algorithms is dangerous because it seems like these &quot;moral values&quot; are intruding and curtailing the freedom of people more and more. And to talk about the real substance of this debate, it is clear that it all started from the failing conventional (mostly liberal) media because Hillary lost. However, there is no proof that Hillary lost because of this fake news. And there is no proof that the future &quot;gatekeeper&quot; of fake news won&#39;t be biased himself. The gatekeeper may indeed be choosing to reject news as fake depending on whose side it&#39;s coming from and not depending on if it&#39;s actually fake.", "comment_date": "2016-12-21T02:11:49Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Rafael Rabinovich", "comment_text": "What happened in this past elections is that false information was spread by main steam news media - such as announcing that Clinton was surely winning the electoral vote when in fact she was losing.", "comment_date": "2016-12-21T02:11:21Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "PTNLemay", "comment_text": "Why the not-insignificant number of dislikes?<br><br>EDIT:<br>Ah... he brought up the election.

In it he explains how the collapse of large-scale narratives (which he calls &#39;meta-narratives&#39;) and the emergence of information technology (which, back then, he called &#39;databases&#39;) leads to the breakdown of the elite&#39;s monopoly on the production of knowledge. What then follows is what he called &#39;paralogism&#39; \u2014 contradictory speech stemming from a multitude of sources (foretelling the notion of &#39;crowdsourcing&#39;) which produces a new composite field of information, which for a good while doesn&#39;t seem to have a structure. But as Complexity Theory teaches us, structure is always emergent and therefore even given the new conditions, knowledge will gradually acquire a morphology. This is not to say that knowledgeable people cannot exert some influence on the mass, but that their task is rendered simulatenously more complex by the sheer number of paralogical sources.

With your Nobel Prize-winning messiah leading the charge, you have corrupted our moral values and made this world a more dangerous place, then baldly lied to us about it. Now, you come crying, &quot;Why do people believe fake news?&quot; Everything the Democrats, Liberals and Leftists have been pushing for the last eight years <b>is</b> fake! However, you are too in love with yourselves to see it. <br><br>You think that we should have a marketplace of ideas, using reason to arrive at the truth, but, in reality, you are lying to yourselves. Let me give you a brief example. I am 100% anti-same-sex marriage. I am opposed to the acceptance of homosexuality or LGBTQAI rights. So, when the issue comes up in a newspaper or public forum, I rationally voice my objections... and I&#39;m immediately banned. I&#39;ve been banned from &quot;The Atlantic,&quot; &quot;Dallas Morning News&quot; and other forums when I&#39;ve brought up this issue. You Progressive, Liberal, intellectual thinkers decided that challenging your world view on this issue is so offensive that you have to silence dissent. That&#39;s your idea of open-mindedness. Now, you come crying, &quot;Why don&#39;t people listen to us?&quot; <br><br>I got into an argument on Facebook with some LGBT advocates. At various points last Saturday, I denounced them as cowards. When Sunday evening rolled around, Facebook began the online discipline process, restricting my access for increasingly longer periods of time. I was put on a 24-hour ban over Monday. Soon after that expired, Facebook&#39;s system put me on a three-day ban for something that I had written several days earlier. Even though I can&#39;t post anything, I&#39;m still facing increasingly longer bans based on what I wrote several days ago. Eventually, I will reach the maximum ban, and my account will be deleted. At this point, it&#39;s virtually automatic, all based on what I wrote last Saturday. I know that by next week, my Facebook account, that I&#39;ve had for most of a decade, will be deleted. It&#39;s just taking time for Facebook&#39;s disciplinary system to catch up on all the punishment that I have to receive before that happens. <br><br>So, no, you are not the enlightened, noble people you think you are.

Those who disregard the Law of noncontradiction are, literally, the definition of irrational.  The idea of truth necessarily excludes all that which fails to meet its requirements: not all people can have correct beliefs.

The vast majority of people never left that culture, and therefore each culture&#39;s beliefs and ideologies became more and more enforced within that culture, with little to no influence from outside ideas.

No one cares to take time to do research and check facts.

I think people also rather accept false information then call out their friends or family or tell them they are wrong, so they go along with it. It&#39;s just the many many ways our society sucks, we are still stuck in the stone ages as far as this stuff goes. I am lucky in that i never trust anyone, no matter who they are, and i will simply ignore news that hasn&#39;t been proven true or i will say to others that news is fake, but problem is when you confront them, your told your wrong, y our stupid, you need to wake up, and their reasoning is that your a minority, since majority believes the article is real, it must be real then. And worst part of all of this is that everytime a fake news article or conspiracy theory is completely debunked, these same people do not apologize, they don&#39;t post on facebook or let their friends know that what they told them turns out was wrong, no they will never admit they where wrong, they will even claim they never said those things originally even if you had proof on video/old posts, etc. Then they will come up with some other bull instead of apologizing for their horrible error. Passing along false and damaging information should make you think twice about doing it again in the future, yet everyone keeps doing it again and again and again.

I would urge anyone whom is now proclaiming the death of truth to look back in history. The general consensus about mass production of books and newspapers, the same general consensus about the printing press and even production by scribes, is that at first we thought that it would be a boon to mankind, because it would allow us to disseminate truth to the masses more effectively then ever before. To a degree, that makes sense too. The printing press in its basic form enabled production of books and pamphlets on scales never before imagined, allowed their costs to come down and become in the reach of wider and wider audiences.<br><br>The problem has always been, with that argument, that people value facts in the same way, and want to interpret them in the same way. Facts do not, indeed cannot, speak for themselves.

But there are a few things I&#39;d like to bring up, since these issues spring to mind all the time for me whenever topics such as this one is brought up.<br>1. Often, when the topic of, &quot;We need to look at ideas that challenge us,&quot; come up, there always seems to be an implicit shade of accusation, rather than self reexamination: in the previous sentence, I get the sense that &quot;we&quot; might as well be replaced with &quot;you people who disagree with me.&quot; In other words, rather than saying, &quot;We need to look at ideas that challenge us,&quot; there tends to be an implicit, &quot;You guys need to look at ideas that challenge you. (But as for me\u2014I&#39;m good.)&quot; And while my suspicions might ultimately be misrepresenting your intentions (and they might well be), if I\u2014someone who agrees with you on almost all your points\u2014can misinterpret it that way, then it&#39;s almost certain that someone on the other side of the political spectrum will hear it that way. So in that light, I&#39;m glad Derek brought up the car conversation in question period, and I would like to build on that: I need to be radically self conscious when I engage in conversations such as climate change, raising the minimum wage, racial and gender inequality, because I could be wrong or misled on any of these things.<br>2. One of the things that did bug me the most about this video is that true and false were often presented as the only options, when that&#39;s misrepresenting the vast majority of &quot;false&quot; news. In fact, I would say that the most effective fake news play on grey areas\u2014that line where it&#39;s not technically false, but not technically true. And this is in a way reveals the real trick of it all: I like to make connections, and so facts as they stand aren&#39;t of much interest. What is interesting is something that plays into some narrative\u2014and more interesting still, something that plays into my narrative. News that the Russian government likes Trump: &quot;meh.&quot; News that the Russian government used hackers to help skew the results of the election: &quot;keep going!&quot; News that the Russian government used hackers to skew the results of the election, AND that electronic polling stations tend to have higher Trump votes: &quot;Wow! The Russian government hacked into the voting booths and made Trump the winner! I gotta share this!&quot;(I&#39;m not claiming that any news site actually said this, but some definitely did give off this vibe.) My point: notice how none of the three above statements were necessarily false. But each one was used more suggestively to advance the liberal (my own) agenda. In these scenarios, it&#39;s not a matter of true or false, but rather one of interpretation. And so echoing my first point, from a stance of self-reexamination, I need to be more careful about calling something out as false. Is it really flat-out false? Is it misleading? Is it using true data in a way that I might not?

Speaking of which, there is our real culprit: Corporate Media. The corporate media has a persistent extreme establishment bias, it has an economic interest in that system never changing, and therefore an interest in people remaining ill informed. It is the dire problem of unending false equivalency that you find on EVERY TV news station. They are not interested in being OBJECTIVE, they&#39;re interested in being &quot;NEUTRAL,&quot; which by the way, is largely impossible on many issues. If you watch TV media, be it CNN, Fox or MSNBC, you are ACTIVELY being lied, misinformed and or deceived. They are constantly guilty in countless ways of &quot;the sins of omission&quot; among many other. You literally cannot rely on corporate media to be informed, only misinformed. The situation is damn near remarkably close to if we had State-run news media. The print media isn&#39;t off the hook, either. There is still some ACTUAL journalism that occurs there, but it becomes more and more scarce all the time, especially the bigger the outlet typically. The situation anywhere outside of independent media is pretty dire, but I think that&#39;s largely because some of the reputable independent media sources have learned from the mistakes of our current mainstream.

Throughout the election would you ever see an article from the likes of NYT or WP that didn&#39;t prefix anything remotely critical of Hillary with &quot;Russia may or may not hacked into the DNC&quot; in a thinly veiled attempt to discredit criticism? Have you noticed the use of the term &quot;rebels&quot; or &quot;moderate rebels&quot; in reporting on the middle east? Its western Media&#39;s term for US backed terrorists. These are examples of fact twisting, an example blatant lying is the reporting on Aleppo. If you listen to an independent journalist who has actually been on the ground in Aleppo and are motivated entirely by delivering the truth with no ulterior motives, for example Eva Bartlett, you will find that western Media&#39;s reports that Russia and the Syrian army are the bad guys in the conflict are completely false, and the direct opposite is true.

You are making a few mistakes here. You seem to hold the belief that TRUE NEWS was at the order of the day, until the internet came along, and along with the internet came the so-called FAKE NEWS then. This is obviously wrong. Before the internet the FAKE NEWS prevailed. Outlets such as CNN and SKY NEWS and BBC and ABC and NBC and MSNBC were constantly indoctrinating the masses by towing the party line and spreading FAKE NEWS that was aimed at supporting the biases held by the government of the day. Hollywood also contributed towards spreading FAKE NEWS. Just think of all the movies that we have seen in which Russia, for example, is made out to be the bad entity, and the West the good entity. Think about movies such as &quot;The Hunt For Red October&quot; ... and there are millions more where that came from. That&#39;s why I only laugh when I see Martin Sheen and the rest of his D-rated actor friends spreading anti-Trump videos. With the advent of the internet the TRUE NEWS was provided with a path along which it could spread its message. Without the internet we would have remained the slaves of the Globalists, such as Soros, forever. Your reference to the Arab Spring starting out as a possible good thing also came as a surprise to me. The Arab Spring was all about the dethroning of leaders such as Gaddafi and Mubarak and Assad, amongst other, all with the intent of establishing a foothold from where the iSlamic Caliphate could spread. Islamic Terrorism is worse today that it has been the last 400 years, and that is to a large extent just another negative repercussionof the so-called Arab Spring.

This may sound like a &quot;gotcha&quot;, but it&#39;s pertinent to this particular divide. The problem with making this claim that we live in a &quot;post-truth&quot; world is that both &#39;groups&#39; as you call them can use this argument in their favor, meaning that the universal test doesn&#39;t work here. If it is the case that people don&#39;t agree on the &#39;truth&#39;, then you must agree on the qualifiers to which the truth is made, or (to use the jargon) the &#39;truth-makers&#39;.

The truth, as the public understand it, hasn&#39;t changed in it&#39;s qualitative distinctions (from things that aren&#39;t true) for 2 or 3 decades. I suspect the advent of the internet encourages the use a kind of fallacy (I forget the name) in which a flood of faulty evidence may be used to support a claim, consequently giving us no practical way of fact checking. But in all the media I&#39;ve consumed over the past year, I&#39;ve seen active attempts at subverting confirmation bias, be it successful or not. The agreed upon method to finding the truth now seems to use a form of abduction, wherein one views multiple outlets of media, focusing and accounting for their ideological differences to find commonly agreed facts which are said to be the most likely true facts. However, there is a more experimentalist method which is undertaken by large enough communities like 4chan, who will deliberately prop up a fake story in order to troll the media by airing it. This separates the wheat from the chaffe, and those worth listening to will have the opportunity to prove themselves.

Also the mainstream news has also become more and more like advertisements masquerading as news. For example the local news might do a story on &quot;boat maintenance and safety&quot; and interview and owner of a local boat dealership, who also just so happens to have a sale right now, so come on down today!!!  <br>There is also a perception that the news media, rather than striving to bring the truth about our government to the populace, are instead working with the government to suppress stories that don&#39;t put the US in a good light.<br>Another one is that most mainstream media frame themselves as being totally neutral politically, when in reality everyone can see that most of these organisations are mostly left leaning. I think this is the reason why a lot of people who were in the middle are starting to move toward the right. <br>Also, mainstream news has also been releasing stories that are completely false. <br><br>People are going to the internet for their news because the &quot;new news media&quot; seems to most people to have less of the drawbacks of the traditional media. <br><br><a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dvk2PQNcg8w&amp;t=12m40s\">12:40</a> Solving this &quot;problem&quot; by pushing a specific set of narratives and suppressing other points of view, while at the same time stating that your position is the absolute truth and therefore the neutral position, will only make the problem worse and is a slippery slope. Facebook has every legal right to do what they want with their algorithms, but I have every right to use another site that does not suppress dissenting points of view. Congratulations, you have just widened the divide between the different sides.

The only way to keep your views alive, both in your mind and the minds of others if that is something you want to do, is to speak up and make your ideas known, or to silence the opposition by the means available to you.

However, not everything that is a fact is also an objective truth. Yet we&#39;re being asked to accept these facts without question. Great example: you cited gay marriage (<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dvk2PQNcg8w&amp;t=2m36s\">2:36</a>) as evidence of societal progress towards tolerance. However, many people - in most cases majorities of populations - do not see the approval of gay marriage as societal progress, and hold that gay marriage is in fact a form of societal decay. Whether you agree with one side or the other, gay marriage is not an objective truth of any kind, but people are told that if they support it they are virtuous and good, but if they oppose it they are intolerant and evil. And in that characterization, we see far more intolerance for opponents of gay marriage than for proponents of gay marriage. And that is the problem - you can&#39;t simply make the claim that your viewpoint is based on facts and is therefore right with any degree of credibility when you&#39;re not willing to allow the same levels of consideration for opposing viewpoints. In the end, there are a lot of people who are playing fast and loose with the ideas of &quot;truth&quot; and &quot;fact&quot;, and they are doing a tremendous disservice to themselves and others. <br><br>Incidentally, &quot;fake news&quot; is itself not a real thing. There has been no actual evidence of so-called fake news being a factor in the election, and had Hillary Clinton not lost, we would not now be examining the issue. What is true is that heterodoxical viewpoints are now as readily available as orthodox viewpoints. With a large swath of Americans getting their news from social media platforms and not from previously dominant mainstream media sources, it is difficult for any one group or individual to control their own messaging, much less respond to the cacophony of dissenting opinions. The controversy over fake news is really a manufactured controversy in an attempt to once again reign in the channels through which people get their information. This exact same conversation happened in the 1990&#39;s when AM talk radio became the almost exclusive medium of conservative talk show hosts who had previously not enjoyed cultural dominance in a media landscape dominated by left-wing voices. Or, the 1960&#39;s when Pirate Radio allowed anti-establishment opinions (and music, for which it is now known) to flourish. Or in the 1930&#39;s when Congress actually passed a law forcing broadcasters to give equal time to opposing political viewpoints. Or in 1900, when politicians and industrialists attacked tabloid newspapers as &quot;muckrackers&quot; and &quot;yellow journalists&quot;. <br><br>This is where you, Mr Muller, really have to take your lumps.

To paraphrase Ecclesiastes 1:9, there is nothing new under the sun,  not even your rant in this video. It&#39;s almost the exact same thesis written by Douglas Rushkoff in his book &quot;Coercion&quot;, written more than 17 years ago.

It started with World War I.  And it has grown steadily ever since.  Prior to World War I, science and reason were seen as purely good, seen as incapable of being used for making things worse.  World War I disabused the world of that notion, as mustard gas rolled down the hills and into the trenches.  That cracked the ice.  Then World War II came, with eugenics and the &#39;mental hygiene&#39; efforts claiming to be derived from science and reason and being responsible for horrors.  Throughout the 20th century, tragedy after tragedy was laid at the feet of science as various people cut corners and did things with &#39;good intentions&#39; in place of scientific rigor which resulted in monumental suffering and destruction.<br><br>On top of that, you have what I have for years referred to as the biggest problem facing the human species (and for which I have no answer).  The act of civilizing, of building a civilization, consists primarily of removing danger and suffering from peoples lives.  This is what we build civilizations for.  Yet, it is precisely that danger and that suffering which provides the visceral motivation to abandon intuition and to turn to reason and critical thinking.  With those dangers removed by an infrastructure built by others, there is literally no tangible benefit to expending the effort necessary to ignore ones intuition and instead think critically.  This allows the growth of worldviews which claim that the infrastructure is either unnecessary or, in itself, more harmful than those things it is said to protect people from. <br><br>You can not convince a person, through reason, that reason is worthwhile.  If they do not accept that reason is superior to their intuition, no amount of earnest argument or presentation of facts and explanations can possibly sway them.  And those who understand that reason is how the world functions and is the only legitimate way to conduct ones life find themselves in a bit of a pickle.  If they do what is necessary to convince such people that reason is warranted - engaging in emotional manipulation or coercion instead of appealing to reason - they fundamentally debase themselves, and put themselves in a position of being both a horrible human being and also having no real way to determine if they are doing good or bad.  The ends do not justify the means, and even if it worked, it would provide the person being &quot;convinced&quot; with an immediate way to destroy the intellectuals position as hypocritical.<br><br>Eventually, the population of people guiding their &quot;thinking&quot; and actions by intuition rather than reason will grow, and it will become impossible to gain enough widespread support necessary to maintain, let alone expand, the infrastructure which provides them with the safe life which makes their intuition-driven lifestyle possible and consequence-free.  We see this already with the anti-vaccine movement.  They will act to destroy the infrastructure which protects them because it is impossible to convince them that the dangers it removes are greater than the cost of the infrastructure.  One might be tempted to think that once the danger re-asserts itself (in this case in the form of dead children lying at the feet of parents responsible for their demise due to avoiding vaccinations) that the result would be a quick correction, and a learning moment by which they realize the error of their ways.<br><br>There is no evidence suggesting that such a thing is likely.  When intuition-driven worldviews are confronted by tragedy, they reliably respond in the same way - they double down.  They will be immediately and easily convinced that the flaw in their approach was in not going far enough.  This is the emotionally much easier view to accept, and the emotional ease of acceptance is precisely what they use to determine &#39;truth&#39;.  They will blame other aspects of the infrastructure which they had not removed, and will set about undoing those.<br><br>After this proceeds for a time, with more danger and suffering reasserting itself into their lives, the bulk of humanity will return to what one might call their &#39;ground state&#39;.  Humanity lived for thousands of years in a state where every nation on the planet was led by a god-king, either believed to be a literal god or at least appointed by one.  Wars were constant, between factions fighting over whose god was best.  Disease was rampant, with superstition and ignorance held up as wisdom.  Perhaps after a few thousand more  years of that, we might have a Second Enlightenment.  And maybe at the peak of that, someone might figure out the solution to the problem.  How to remove the basic motivation to pursue reason from everyone&#39;s lives, yet somehow still convince them to turn their back on the intuition that arises in them naturally as the basic functioning of brain.<br><br>I have considered this problem for well over a decade, and have no clue of a solution.  The only ideas I&#39;ve come up with are tremendously dark, stupendously unethical, and should be completely unacceptable to any reasonable person.

We evolved to be competitive both as individuals and as groups. This helps us when we are fighting for limited resources and hinders us when cooperation would benefit people more. When an individual tries to find their community, their team so to speak, they gravitate towards a position that their team can do no wrong, and the other teams can do no right. You see this in politics a lot where someone identifies as a particular party, and it becomes almost like their sports team. They want to see their team win, and the other team fail. Their team can only do right, and the other teams can only do wrong. It&#39;s a kind of tribalism, and you see it in all areas of life from social groups, to political views, to income. How many times have you heard people talk about rich fat cats, and poor ignorant people? What does your income have to do with the value of your ideas either way? <br><br>Then you get into the issue of confirmation bias, where you form an opinion and rather than test it and refine it, you seek others of the same opinion to feel that you are right. I&#39;m a firm believer of the odd man out. That any group that is too similar, will make bad decisions. You need unpopular speech and unpopular ideas in order to make good decisions. You need disagreement and people of different backgrounds and philosophies arguing their side. If everybody thinks and reasons the same way, then they will make the same mistakes in reasoning and nobody will catch the mistake. If you have strongly voiced opposition making a coherant argument against your position, then mistakes can be caught. It&#39;s hard to take criticism because it feels like you are being attacked but if you want to grow as an individual you must welcome criticism and learn to listen to it. You have to want to find mistakes and correct them. You have to take the position that mistakes are going to happen and not beat yourself up about them but learn and move on.<br><br>This last part is ironic but you also need to be brave enough to stand up to invalid positions and call out people and groups that are toxic and that take a position merely to ruffle peoples feathers and cause controversy. As competitive as people are a lot of us seek to avoid confrontation and people who seek to do harm to honest debate will sometimes use this against them. They may take deliberately harsh positions in order to confuse the debate and generate controversy that detracts from the actual discussion. You have to recognize the difference between honest criticism, and baseless attacks and respond differently to each.

Arbitrators choosing such and such parameters for an algorithm are also human and thus subject to human fallibility like any other. I&#39;m sorry, but I must disagree with your solutions. I think the best answer is not to make a system based on algorithmic intervention, but on complete and total freedom of information. Nothing favored more than any other except by any given shared thing reaching the top of the &#39;lists&#39; based on how many unique views it gets. (Perhaps algorithms to account for and subtract automated views, at the most) If the system is built to be as simple as that the problem is reduced to the root, which is human nature. Creating algorithms to try and arbitrate what is and isn&#39;t factual information to attempt to accommodate human nature? A Sisyphean task, I guarantee you. What we really need to address is how people think, and if we must interfere at all with the exchange of information I argue the MOST that you should do is have search engines put a sidebar on their homepages that links to &#39;politically neutral&#39; books, articles, and lectures about logic and cognitive biases for the use of the average person. In addition, when making certain searches for answers to questions that favor one side, perhaps add a button that will tell the engine to search for things its algorithms estimate are related to and/or disagree with the given results, for comparative convenience. I think that the system by which we exchange information must be allowed to organically adapt as it will without direct interference, because you will never be able to eliminate the irrationality that gets expressed due to human nature without redesigning the human race itself.

It not really &quot;Why do people not care about fact&quot; But instead &quot;Why does fake news generate so much more clicks and attention compared to legitimate news&quot;. The answer is clear, it all comes down to profitability. Real news always had a problem making money, this was true 10 years ago and it is true now.<br><br>My second issue is with narrowness. Narrowness in both the definition of Fake News and the scope you are looking at it. First off I feel your creating a strict idea of what &quot;Fake news&quot; is. This new wave internet blogs that intentionally spread lies to manipulate and make money. Problem is it doesn&#39;t analyze what lead up to it. This leads to narrowness of scope.<br><br>The origins of &quot;fake news&quot; was not grown on the internet, but many different places. Lets look at only a few. First Main Stream Media. This has been pretty solid force of intentionally misleading and untrue news story for long time. Both CNN and Fox both are to blame. But to get to the first problem, Why ? Well easily answer is TV is dying, profits are down across the board. &quot;Fake News&quot; is just objectively more profitible.<br><br>We can also look at the Scientific community. Scientific research papers are also facing it own dilemma of &quot;Fake News&quot;. Around 90% of all published papers can&#39;t actually be replicated. The &quot;Why&quot; for this is also pretty simple. All the money goes to &quot;New and unique theories&quot; and almost no money goes towards reproducing theories.<br><br>There myriad of different examples, be them tabloids, Satire, or even our own politicians. But it almost always come down to money. By having such a bigger scope and view on &quot;Fake News&quot; we can see similarities between all of them.<br><br>So overall I don&#39;t think it is the internet fault that Fake News exists. It has existed for a very long time. News faces same issue it always has. That in a completely open market, it struggles to stay profitable. Solution is a hard one. Think up a creative way how to make honest and true news story more profitable then fake and controversial ones.<br><br>Although this is bigger then even news.

Information is what we humans make decisions for our lives from. So it is important that the information we believe in is &quot;as true as possible&quot;.<br>Why don&#39;t people care about facts? At some point, I think they do. But they don&#39;t want to hear multiple stories. As was outlined in the video, they want to hear something that will comfort their existing beliefs rather than continuously challenging them. That is the core of the problem. Why don&#39;t they want to challenge their beliefs? Because it costs brain power and time. Moreover, when you&#39;re hunting a deer, you don&#39;t want to challenge every second your attack plan, so I guess that the most stubborn people were selected in the evolution of men. Because you have to make up your mind fast when in a jungle environment. No time to hesitate and reconsider. I may be wrong, though.<br>I question everything I know, all the time. Science has been able to go forward because it is allowed to question current knowledge and replace it with something that has shown to be better. But indeed, it is a difficult habit to pick. It is a habit. As most people have a habit of never challenging anything, some others do the exact opposite. How to pick that habit? Well maybe you have to remember that once you believed in Santa.<br>Now to the questioning of the algorithms, that gets tricky. What is a reliable source? What is fake news? Take Aleppo. You have two sides, one yelling &quot;they are killing women and children&quot;, the other one saying &quot;hey I&#39;m just freeing civilians from terrorists... which by the way you put there in the first place!&quot;. Who am I to believe? Did any of the two sides never tell any lies? Both did. I&#39;m not in Aleppo right now, so there is no way for me to know &quot;for sure&quot; what is going on. Even if I were and did witness some horrifying murder of a woman, how do I know she wasn&#39;t a suicide bomber that was shot before it was too late? If I&#39;m pushing news from one side or the other, I could very well be spreading fake news. In your idea of things (or facebook&#39;s for that matter), who will decide what is fake? Algorithms? Well, what if both sides are not really so credible for some reason? My guess is that the ones who decide would have a bias, and that would become censorship, very very fast. And I don&#39;t want censorship. I want people to start questioning things instead. But nobody is teaching them. Everybody is yelling &quot;fake news! fake news!&quot; on every side, without even providing any evidence. And the only solution that is offered is &quot;let&#39;s put a police to select the good news for you&quot;. Well, apparently you don&#39;t know that, but you can&#39;t &quot;edit&quot; Wikipedia on a lot of controversial subjects, and they have set their police long ago. The result is that it is not possible to question anything anymore, because only one side of the story can be heard. And that clearly upsets me.

They were only covered by smaller independent media outlets for a very long time up until recently, which are considered by many mainstream media outlets to be fake news sites. Only after the story gained momentum on social media sites, like Facebook, did the mainstream media reluctantly pick up the story and begin reporting it. Another counter example to show such an algorithm would fail is the lead up the Iraq War propagated by the Bush Administration. The Mainstream Media acted as a mouth piece for the US government, reporting as truth that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction. Very few outlets, even those with an opposing political bias, countered the narrative that Iraq was a threat and Saddam Hussein needed to be overthrown. The same thing happened in the last few years with the civil war in Syria. It is now a known fact that the US was, and still is as of today, funneling weapons to terrorist groups, such as Al Nusra, an offshoot of Al Qaeda , in order to counter Assad, fighting a proxy war by arming the enemies of the US. Only alternate independent news sites like The Pontiac Tribune and Storm Clouds Gathering, which are considered by the Mainstream to be fake news sites, were reporting on this illicit weapons trading back in 2013, years before it was accepted as truth and fact. Another example is the domestic US spy program PRISM, which Alex Jones and other alternate news outlets have been talking about since 2007. This was seen as tinfoil-hat wearing lunacy but was later proven truth when Edward Snowden leaked this data to the public.<br><br>The Mainstream Media, in which each outlet has its own bias and agendas, tends to report on stories they deem worthy and does not question the official narrative of the US government and their large corporate owners. The Mainstream Media, in itself, is its own tribe, its own echo chamber. If we rely on an algorithm to look for large amounts of links that will be perpetuated by a massive echo chamber created by the Mainstream Media, then the stories they report only on will be deemed as the truth, as the facts, when in reality there are greater truths that will be buried, censored, or marginalized because those smaller outlets don&#39;t have the supposed credibility of the Mainstream Media.

If you intend to find the REAL truth, you have to take in a wide variety of news sources, aggregate their summaries, and find the consistencies. In science, it&#39;s not fact unless it is repeatable, so if a wide variety of news stations come up with all different kinds of stories and summaries of what happens, but only one or two elements of the stories remain relatively consistent between all of the stories, then those are the ONLY facts that can be gleamed from that certain event.

We choose what evidence we consider to be right or meaningful, what is sufficient to sway us, and these choices are predicated on our emotions. We can never be totally certain that a proposition is true, because we can never be certain that we have all the evidence, that we selected it perfectly, or that the methods used to procure that information are totally reliable. This goes especially now that the authority of those who once provided what was considered truthful, factually valid statements has been undermined by the internet and postmodernist thought, be they universities, news media, politicians, whatever. When we politicise the information processes we can pick and choose the media, consciously or not, that supports what we wish to believe. We can decide which stories are a result of media incompetence or conspiracy, which is a product of patriarchy and racism and what is not.<br><br>The answer, near as I can tell, is to consider instead what the consequences of our beliefs are and how they change our behaviour. What <b>functions</b> do our beliefs have for us. Derek&#39;s change to  driving a car longer instead of buying an electric one is sensible in light of Derek&#39;s desire to reduce emissions. A scientific theory is useful in terms of how many phenomena it explains. Evolution is virtually factual because it explains so much, but we can never say for certain that it is true. If our desire is to explain biological phenomena and the development of organisms in history then it is more useful for us to adopt the belief that evolution is true. The belief that one should do research reflects a desire to explain whatever it is we wish to explain. If that&#39;s a particular political narrative, then we will amass evidence that proves that narrative. The trick is that we can&#39;t actually be sure our own desires are what we say. If we say we wish to stop Daesh and plan to bomb them, but ignore Daesh&#39;s internal documents that hope to foment the belief that Islam is at war with the West to drive up recruitment, then our desire probably isn&#39;t to stop Daesh, but it may be to display power to feel good about ourselves, or something else.<br><br>Now we consider this election. Believing in fake news reflects a predisposition to believe in whatever statement that news said. If you &quot;knew&quot; it was fake, you would not believe it, so you would ignore it. Thus those who were swayed by it were amenable to being convinced.

Thus, if we want to stop fake news about, say, government conspiracy that government should act so as to increase confidence.

The result of these algorithms is a virtual echo chamber where people are only exposed to ideas and stories the user is already biased towards agreeing with, over time people become less critical of what they read, and false stories get bounced around inside the echo chamber. The whole idea of &quot;Fake news&quot; is itself an example of the sort of group-think that should be eliminated. <br><br>The idea of Fake News was popularized by Jon Stewart who openly referred to The Daily Show, a satirical critique of nightly news programs, as &quot;Fake News&quot; in contrast to &quot;Real News&quot; outlets who did a shitty job of accurately reporting the news. Now those &quot;real news&quot; outlets are repurposing &quot;Fake News&quot; to distract from their own failed reporting. &quot;Fake News&quot; itself is an amorphous term that can be used to describe any story someone disagrees with based on political ideology or other biases. Anti-obama conservatives looked at Obama and concluded that he was born outside of the US and anything to the contrary must be fake or a forgery. Rational or pro-Obama people accepted he was born in the US, and rightly thought the Birther movement was based on conspiracies.

If an outlet is publishing stories without malice, but also without regard to accuracy in order to perpetuate a deeply held belief they could more accurate by called conspiracy theorists, or click-bait scammers.If an outlet publishes inaccurate news out of incompetence it&#39;s unreliable and inaccurate reporting. These problems have been around since the dawn of communication, but they&#39;ve been exacerbated by social websites that confine users in an echo chamber where false stories are uncritically repeated until they&#39;re accepted as real.

The format was so engaging. In particular I enjoyed the discussion from the audience. In fact an entire video of discussion of this caliper would be awesome.  At first I was apprehensive to give up 19 minutes, but it was worth it as it prompted a first time comment on my behalf. <br><br>Second I am an educator. I teach chemistry and AP Physics. I use your videos often. One example is your \u201cCan You Solve This\u201d video which I use at the end of an introductory lesson on the scientific method.  While eating a pack of Sour Patch Kids I complain about how it seems there are more yellow gummies that red. This angers me, because red is my favorite. After I get the students debating why and if this is the case I allow them to develop an experiment to test it. I pull out a small bag for each student and behold every single time there are more red then yellow. This idea came to me after watching your video. I was eating this treat and really wondered if I was on to something, or it each incidence of a yellow gummy just confirmed my wrong idea. After I play your video. I pause the video, write their numbers on the board and guess what. They are nearly identical to your audience. It is pretty funny. If you ever want to collaborate with a tech savvy science educator and nerd, please just ask. It would be my pleasure. <br><br>In reference to this particular video I would like to add that maybe the solution is the same as addressing science misconceptions. From my own experience and research the only way to challenge the deeply rooted misconceptions student have about the world (and they are deeply rooted) is to present them, or rather allow them to be presented with, evidence of the contrary. I liken this to the Water Boy affect. You have to be careful when teaching against what &quot;mama says.&quot; What this looks like in the splinter net, I am not sure. <br><br>Another point that I would like to make only to add to the conversation pertains to evolution. It may be that the easily led sheep eventually fall of the cliff to their death. It may be that misinformation will always be present and used to coarse those that lack the critical thinking skills to deflect such attacks. That is a very bleak view I know.  I imagine that view is similar to declaring those with diabetes should be left to die out.  I do recognize that just as medical intervention is an aspect of our evolution that prevents disease rather than sole natural selection, the development of some system of controlling misinformation may be needed as well. This is being done, but probably not deliberately as a wide spread infrastructure. In fact you were very close to the epicenter (or one of them), Huntsville Alabama.

Not reporting on damaging news means all they were reporting on was not the whole truth, and in essence, fake. <br><br>The Alt media has the same incentives.

My point is, yes, we encounter stumbling blocks, but in the end when you turn the camera around and I saw all those young faces in your classroom, it inspires faith in progress. As I think, the younger generation is more apt to question what the internet puts in front of them, because they have grown up with it and know how to use the tech more-so then older generations to which the internet represents something a bit mystical. The younger generations tend to use the internet as a bridge to the world, and older generations seem to use it as a moat and build their own information castle, but don&#39;t venture outside that comfort zone to challenge their beliefs. Youthful folk say, &quot;That is interesting I didn&#39;t know that...&quot; and continue down the internet rabbit hole, while the older folk will say &quot;I don&#39;t believe that...&quot; and close the window. Of course this is MHO, but as an IT professional for 20 yrs who has interacted with a wide range of internet users from the start, that is my general take away. I don&#39;t mean to generalize but that is what I personally have seen.  <br><br>When I see a young person read about a topic the first thing they do is start opening other tabs, looking at the author, looking at various sources, and just in general using it more efficiently, especially as a research and communications/socialization tool, then the older generation. Who I see will just go to certain news site, or two, or three of their liking, but they don&#39;t do the same due diligence of many younger people using the internet do. Plus younger folk seem to expand their social groups, outside of just peers, while the older generation keeps in touch with people they already know. <br><br>I think given a little more time, the pendulum will swing the other way, and more folks will be able to use the internet in a manner to bring knowledge and truth to everyone, as well as bring us as people closer together by revealing how similar we all are. But then again maybe that is me just having faith in the next generation being a bit more empirically minded and a bit more empathetic towards other beliefs and cultures.", "comment_date": "2016-12-20T18:24:24Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "superqix", "comment_text": "Just stick to science...", "comment_date": "2016-12-20T18:24:15Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Ken R.", "comment_text": "<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dvk2PQNcg8w&amp;t=0m38s\">0:38</a>  &quot;Why does fake news spread now?&quot;  Why do you assume fake news is something new?

The context is about the &quot;information super highway&quot; also know as the Internet. The question asked in the beginning can be summarized as &quot;why is it when information is easily accessible is there no one looking up the facts?&quot; Another question that may be posed is how can the facts be found or what specific facts are being referred to? If there were one compliant as an audience member listening to this discussion is to be more specific and put the question into context more clearly. The comments and questions from the students put what Veritasium was trying to communicate into context more clearly. One example that was brought up was Arab Spring, but he did not really elaborate the context of using that example. Traditionally it is the speakers objective to inform. The students provided examples of politics and current events at the beginning of their responses.  Perhaps if he did write his speech, and even revise his speech there would be more clarity and content to be communicated to the audience in the classroom and on Youtube. If only people spent more time to do research and revise their thinking on paper until what their intention of what they wanted to say is actually said in their speech or writing. What his argument leads to is that the internet algorithms and the spread of fake news is a symptom of a larger problem of how people with ideologies manipulate the internet to create reactions out of people rather than presenting the facts. His question however does not have an answer and gives the students a forum for discussion about the problem. From an outsider&#39;s perspective he did not clearly present it as a question with possible reasons but an answer. Something even an expert may doubt as true based on the grounds of where the information is coming from. The title reminds me of a documentary by Adam Curtus called Hypernormalisation. There are probably many books by credible sources that are not present in the talk here.

I hope that we all can agree that all of us have cognitive biases, nobody is perfect. Now, there are certain media, who, presumably unaware to themselves, rate their own political views higher than those of the people who comment there. They should report about the facts, about the truth, not create and report their view of the facts and create their own truth. When people&#39;s opinions are being censored and deleted simply on the fact that they do not agree with the political leaders currently in power, people are forced to form groups, often dubious. There are many people proclaiming no tolerance to intolerance, but they themselves act very intolerantly of other people&#39;s opinion. Somehow they took the right to claim that only they have some moral authority. And everybody disagreeing with them is an right wing extremist, intolerant and xenophobic Nazi bastard. Trust me, I have witnessed it too often. OK, so now people are leaving those groups, but politicians still accept and support them. But the people who support some of the views of these various organizations stop supporting them, because if they have a different view on a single thing and are then labeled all sorts of things, will leave. Eliezer Yudkowsky called this cooling by evaporation. Who remains, if nobody wants to accept a different opinion? I must say that I do not like any extremes, be it on either side. But I have a bad feeling that one side is constantly being bashed by all mainstream media while the other side is still proclaiming to have some moral authority. I refuse to be labelled a racist, Nazi or xenophobe simply because I say out loud that it is not right to let a million people into Europe without even checking who they are. I am being harassed like a criminal by authorities when travelling, but others break all rules and are even allowed to do so. And when I object to such naive approach, my posts are being deleted. And then there are articles that the blood of dying immigrants is on my hands. I object to that! They are not! My country never colonized any parts of the world, my ancestors were slaves themselves. I have no moral obligation to save anybody from a misery caused by somebody else. No, the ones who cause the misery have the obligation and when I see how they address their legacy I feel like being scorned upon. When some people value their own beliefs higher and above what is sane, OK, they can have that. I am telling nobody how to live his life, as long as he does not interfere with my life above a certain point. I am happy to pay taxes with the prospect that the wealth get distributed across all society. I support free education and a basic health care and pension system. This is where have zero problem seeing my money go. But I have a big problem to see my money being spent on things which I consider to be causing more harm than good in the long run. And just in case you are curious, yes, the recent events in Berlin caused me to write this. I disagree with all forms of extremism. But when the media accused me that my hands are dirty with blood of some boy who drowned in the Mediterranean, using the same flawed logic and reasoning I can accuse Angela Merkel for being responsible for the death of innocent people in her own country. I fee the worlds is getting more and more polarized. There is not one single political view that I could identify with. I just see crazy people and then other crazy people. I agree on some points with one group, in other points with another group. It feels like the world has gone crazy and I am forced to choose between two or more\u00a0narrow-minded groups. There is not ONE SINGLE politician who would represent my views. And I am not the only one who feels this way. People lost faith in politics and mainstream media. That is the cause why unsystematic and destructive politics is on the rise, politics with no real value or program than a protest against everything. I myself struggle with the question who to vote next time. The biggest tragedy in my view is that the mainstream media are creating truth according to political order. No wonder people end up visiting dubious sites and reinforcing their positions and creating planets of beliefs, as Sean Carroll named it. I am confronted regularly with such things and refuse all of them equally as I refuse mainstream media. Political correctness is a way to hell. If we refuse to call things as they deserve, if everybody knows but nobody dares to talk in fear of being labeled a right-wing extremist Nazi, even if those who speak up are being labeled equally and deleted, it comes as no wonder to me that we find ourselves in a post-truth society. I would not accuse the internet as being the cause of this. Correlation does not mean causation, but a technology with rapid and worldwide transfer of information as well as disinformation certainly helped in this. But I would not see it as the main factor. The main factor is the race for political correctness, new elites who claim to have the only moral right to judge opinions, who talk about tolerance but show not tolerance to other views than their own. What should I do when I do not identify with anybody&#39;s views? Disclaimer: I dislike any extreme solutions and am in favor of being honest to ourselves. This means putting political correctness aside when it is necessary and everybody to accept their biases which cause a lot of cognitive disonance. But show me one politician who would say or want this and have actual suport from the media or the public! No, the media create truth and give us those things which sell the best. And people are idiots, happily climbing into one or another box. And from the safety of their box they shout out at the people in the other box. I believe this was always part of our nature. The internet did not cause this. It just allowed it to become a cancer. A cancer in the memeplex.

Do not quote me on that, but I recall a documentary  where it was said that 10 biggest tankers that are used to deliver goods and materials produce CO2 equivalent to a medium-sized industrialized country. Another argument: Cars in Germany are not produced from scratch, many car details come from the factories in the EU and abroad. They are delived by trucks or through the sea. And it is just an example that is how every market works. Due to how economy evolved this is a smart decision: more productive, more efficient, less costy and so on.  Also, we should remember that we use fossil fuels to power our factories that smelt metalls, produce plastic and other materials. We mine, transport and refine metalls using oil.

If it&#39;s about reproduction, then it is, but you, and people of like mind, have decided it&#39;s relative and based on personal beliefs, because some fraction of married people were practicing poorly.  This paucity of practice is recent, and this is why the tendency to not understand gay marriage is much more common in older people and gay people, who &quot;cling to&quot; the belief that reproduction is part of marriage and important to society.  I mean, the government acknowledges the importance, in having courts for divorce, lol, and spends a ton of money subsidizing parenting expenses, including baby payments, but, for some reason, it&#39;s still completely unthinkable that your ideological adversaries are reasonable, or even, not based totally on religious arguments.  Now, I&#39;m guessing you&#39;ll still use the same reasoning in the future, even acknowledging that it degrades the esteem you claim in the eyes of folks who disagree.  Indeed, you would likely not want to present dissenting arguments on gay marriage as reasoned.<br><br>And, yeah, I think I have an excellent grasp on why this happens, I&#39;m a bit surprised how common it it, and, also, skeptical about the scale of the problem, as well as the esteem people have for mainstream media, which did this too itself, in no small part, by peddling speculation about how terrible Trump is, off as news for a year.

Since when people find large groups of people who agree with them factual statements tend to get thrown out of the window due to herd mentality. Long story short echo chambers.<br>Like you said it very much seems to be the case that most people tend to make up the opinions of people who they think will disagree with them, for example the majority of the people who use either liberal or republican as an insult.

Wanting to improve security and the economic issues happening on the US border with Mexico is not racism against hispanic people from Mexico.
