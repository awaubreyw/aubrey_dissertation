I&#39;m currently going into Mechanical Engineering, and can&#39;t wait to start, but everyone closest to me or anyone who knows me well knows that astrophysics/cosmology is my true passion. I tried to apply for a double major in ME and physics at my university, but get a lot of mixed responses on such a challenge. First, the university often does not allow engineering majors to double major due to the difficulty of the degree. Second, many engineering majors like to stress that focusing only on one major is more beneficial in that acquiring higher grades and mastering the content is better than killing two birds (majors) with one stone. And third, like many people say, its often more difficult for a physics major to be marketable and find a decent job COMPARED to engineers. <br>However, I am fully aware of all of these considerations, and would like to say that: one; the physics/astrophysics degree is a long term goal of mine. I do not need it now, but I do plan to obtain one in hopes of pursuing a PhD and becoming a cosmologist. The reason I want to try a double major is to start young while my mind is still fresh and evolving, I am very ambitious and would love to learn this stuff as early as I can. Two, I do realize that mastering the engineering content may be better than attempting two majors, but am just open to any sort of advice from ANY type of engineering/physics majors on their experiences, or if they faced the same struggle as I am. And third, I do realize that engineering is a little more easier to become employed, but as many people here say and as I have said earlier, it&#39;s not the &quot;employment&quot; I am looking for, I am looking for the long term goal of obtaining my PhD. Don&#39;t get me wrong, I still love ME and am excited for it, but the physics/astrophysics degree and PhD is my long term goal that I hope and wish to start early because it gets me so excited! So if anyone has advice, tips, stories, or similar experiences they&#39;d like to share, and if you&#39;re a current engineering/physics student, PLEASE tell me anything you have! :D Thank you!!!", "comment_date": "2017-06-02T02:36:51Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Hi", "comment_text": "Binary black holes huh.
