That is a theory proven wrong. Understanding conservation of energy is partly key in understanding how wrong this guy is. Understanding how the accretion of matter works is also partly key to understanding how bodies within the universe formed. From a soup of hot, hydrogen plasma, electrically charged particles and time, we have the first stars, which were the first of those bodies. Those stars were veracious in apatite. They consumed large quantities of hydrogen until some either burst as a supernova or turned into a black hole under the intense gravity. Those first stars seeded the universe with more complex elements and pushed matter around with their explosive forces and gravity. This in turn formed the first galaxies. Time proceeded to tick away through the universe as cosmic bodies either formed or got destroyed. Then after quite a long time, humans began to observe the after effects in a mature universe and proposed how it all began. Many get this wrong, very wrong. There was and is no great creator ghost in the sky, no Heaven, no Hell, no Big Bang. Perhaps many bangs all around after things began to heat up. Just simply observe star forming regions of nebula to see stars form with planetary discs to get a glimpse. Those Nebulae are from massive stars that exploded very long ago. Check out galaxies that are over 12 billion light years away, and fully mature. Does this make sense if at that distance those galaxies should still be very young in our observations? I think not. I believe that the observation of quasars that have a redshift that supposedly makes them appear much farther away than they are is also proof that theories are wrong. The fact that Galaxies are moving in many directions, some faster than others is also proof of the never existing big bang. I am positive that there never was a big bang. Even with the most supermassive black holes, the matter can only be smashed down so far, it continues to grow slowly as it consumes matter. Black holes seem to be quite stable and never simply explode. All matter in the universe can not possibly be smashed down infinitely small, down to the size of the point of a needle.

Modern science currently recognizes four forces of nature: The strong nuclear force, the weak nuclear force, gravity, and electromagnetism.<br>2. In school we are taught that with magnetism, opposite polarities attract and like polarities repel. But inside the arc of a large horseshoe magnet it&#39;s the other way around, like polarities attract and opposite polarities repel. (I have proved this to myself with magnets and anybody with a large horseshoe magnet and two smaller bar magnets can easily prove this to yourself too).<br>3. Charged particles have an associated magnetic field with them.<br>4. Protons and electrons are charged particles and have their associated magnetic fields with them.<br>5. Photons also have both an electric and a magnetic component to them.<br><br>FOUR FORCES OF NATURE DOWN INTO TWO:<br>6. When an electron is in close proximity to the nucleus, it would basically generate a 360 degree spherical magnetic field.<br>7. Like charged protons would stick together inside of this magnetic field, while simultaneously repelling opposite charged electrons inside this magnetic field, while simultaneously attracting the opposite charged electrons across the inner portion of the electron&#39;s moving magnetic field.<br>8. There are probably no such thing as &quot;gluons&quot; in actual reality.<br>9. The strong nuclear force and the weak nuclear force are probably derivatives of the electro-magnetic field interactions between electrons and protons.<br>10. The nucleus is probably an electro-magnetic field boundary.<br>11. Quarks also supposedly have a charge to them and then would also most likely have electro-magnetic fields associated with them, possibly a different arrangement for each of the six different type of quarks.<br>12. The interactions between the quarks EM forces are how and why protons and neutrons formulate as well as how and why protons and neutrons stay inside of the nucleus and do not just pass through as neutrinos do.<br><br>THE GEM FORCE INTERACTIONS AND QUANTA:<br>13. Personally, I currently believe that the directional force in photons is &quot;gravity&quot;.  It&#39;s the force that makes the sine wave of EM energy go from a wide (maximum extension) to a point (minimum extension) of a moving photon.  When the EM gets to maximum extension, &quot;gravity&quot; flips and EM goes to minimum, then &quot;gravity&quot; flips and goes back to maximum, etc, etc.  A stationary photon would pulse from it&#39;s maximum extension to a point possibly even too small to detect, then back to maximum, etc, etc.<br>14. I also believe that a pulsating singularity (which is basically a pulsating photon) is the energy unit in this universe.<br>15. When these pulsating energy units interact with other energy units, they tangle together. Various shapes (strings, spheres, whatever) might be formed, which then create sub-atomic material, atoms, molecules, and everything in existence in this universe.<br>16. When the energy units unite together they would tend to stabilize and vibrate.<br>17. I believe there is probably a Photonic Theory Of The Atomic Structure.<br>18. Everything is basically &quot;light&quot; (photons) in a universe entirely filled with &quot;light&quot; (photons).<br><br>THE MAGNETIC FORCE SPECIFICALLY:<br>19. When the electron with it&#39;s associated magnetic field goes around the proton with it&#39;s associated magnetic field, internal and external energy oscillations are set up.<br>20. When more than one atom is involved, and these energy frequencies align, they add together, specifically the magnetic field frequency.<br>21. I currently believe that this is where a line of flux originates from, aligned magnetic field frequencies.<br><br>NOTES:<br>22. The Earth can be looked at as being a massive singular interacting photon with it&#39;s magnetic field, electrical surface field, and gravity, all three photonic forces all being 90 degrees from each other.<br>23. The flat spiral galaxy can be looked at as being a massive singular interacting photon with it&#39;s magnetic fields on each side of the plane of matter, the electrical field along the plane of matter, and gravity being directed towards the galactic center&#39;s black hole where the gravitational forces would meet, all three photonic forces all being 90 degrees from each other.<br>24. As below in the singularity, as above in the galaxy and probably universe as well.<br>25. I believe there are only two forces of nature, Gravity and EM, (GEM). Due to the stability of the GEM with the energy unit, this is also why the forces of nature haven&#39;t evolved by now. Of which with the current theory of understanding, how come the forces of nature haven&#39;t evolved by now since the original conditions acting upon the singularity aren&#39;t acting upon them like they originally were, billions of years have supposedly elapsed, in a universe that continues to expand and cool, with energy that could not be created nor destroyed would be getting less and less dense? My theory would seem to make more sense if in fact it is really true. I really wonder if it is in fact really true.<br>26. And the universe would be expanding due to these pulsating and interacting energy units and would also allow galaxies to collide, of which, how could galaxies ever collide if they are all speeding away from each other like is currently taught?<br><br>DISCLAIMER:<br>27. As I as well as all of humanity truly do not know what we do not know, the above certainly could be wrong.

I think, often times that scientists (or perhaps those repeating said scientists with lesser understanding or care with their words) have only one explanation for things and thus promote that explanation as truth. I get that. It&#39;s not an honest approach, but I get it. The Scientific method, is limited to observable and REPEATABLE experiments. That deals more so with the here and now.

Because fission releases less energy than fusion, but then again fusion requires more energy to create... grrr. On the quantum scale, I&#39;m going with the first one. Annihilation accelerates. It may just happen to be that annihilation occurs more frequently or this may just be our point in cosmic history that makes it appear so.

The creation and expansion cycles of the Universe can perfectly be explained with &quot;normal&quot; gravity as we observe it everyday. The Big Bang. A large amount of particles with mass falls through the event horizon of a black hole, residing in our mother universe. This cluster of particles is what constitutes our entire Observable Universe (OU). We are made from some of these particles, living somewhere between that event horizon and the singularity. This cluster of mass (Our OU) continues to accelerate towards the direction of the singularity. Due to Tidal Forces (the fact, thanks Newton, that gravitational force is inversely related to the squared of the distance between two bodies of mass) we observe what appears to be an expanding universe. However, knowing that, matter that is closer to the singularity accelerates away from all matter, which is further. And that this &quot;further matter&quot;, in turn accelerates away from all matter that is further than itself. Together with the fact that no two particles in our OU are the same distance from the singularity, we can deduct that all particles in our universe are accelerating away from each other (except for sufficiently dense clusters (Galaxies) that overcome this force (for now)) all in the direction of the singularity. Due to basic Black Hole physics, it is impossible for us to see any light coming from outside our shrinking event horizon (as seen from the &quot;inside&quot;). We call this the Hubble Horizon. Also, because we have no inertial frame outside our OU, we could see at least, we have no clear direction we are heading into, other than time. This explanation also simply accounts for the fact that we observe larger accelerations between more distance parts of our OU. This is due to larger Tidal Forces. Lastly, the schwarzschild radius of a body of mass equivalent to the mass of our OU , is roughly equal to the radius of our OU.
