Much comes to mind, including a basic observation I had 30 years ago or so.  It seems at almost everything, no matter how big or small (i.e., atomic or galactic), behaves in either a cyclic or rhythmic way.  Many energy waves, as they travel through space (sound, radio, light, etc.) are rhythmic. I&#39;m not formally well educated on much of this stuff, so don&#39;t know if there are some energies that travel in a straight line.  Anyone who knows, feel free to comment.  Your vid emphasized synchronization between a broad variety of individuals in a group. But it seems almost everything in the universe has its own established rhythm, which might be the same phenomenon, only with the subcomponents within an individual.  An individual sound wave can only exist (&quot;survive&quot;) if it&#39;s regular.  If the crests (correct term for the outer limit of the wave?) of a wave changes, one of its primary defining characteristics (other than still being defined as sound) changes.  IOW, it becomes something distinctly different from its former self. I&#39;m just thinking this out real time as I write, so I may be off, but inspired (by your vid).  Which I believe presented itself visually at 30 or so FPS via the laptop screen.<br><br>When I was a kid, I noticed that water flowing from our garden hose down the sloped concrete of our driveway, formed waves.  The concrete was (relatively) smooth, surely with no such similar wave pattern on it, so the waves formation was obviously attributable to some other element of fluid dynamics, I believe it&#39;s called.  While knowing specifically why waves form would be nice, it was mostly the observation that they formed period that had me start to see how almost everything (if not literally everything) is rhythmic/cyclic.  And if we don&#39;t think it is, maybe it&#39;s only because of our lives are a nanosecond on the universe&#39;s time scale.  That, or some other element of our limited capacities to perceive, that have us physically unable to detect the cycle<br><br>In astrophysics, the collective opinion among those in the field might be that 13.6 or so billion years ago, there was a mega-monster sized ball...just hanging out.  You know, as it had for all of eternity until that point.  Okay, so that&#39;s impossible, for one thing.  Existence of anything, even empty space is impossible.  It&#39;s impossible that that phat mega ball of matter was simply &quot;always there&quot;.  Something had to create it.  It&#39;s impossible that there was ever a beginning.  While I have a personal, experienced-based belief in a higher power I call God (for convenience), He/It is no exception.  It&#39;s impossible that God, if there is one (I respect that my beliefs are not facts), has always been.  Popular religion doesn&#39;t explain their conception of God.  Saying &quot;He&#39;s always been&quot;, or whatever is claimed, doesn&#39;t explain anything.  It&#39;s just a way of moving on from that which can&#39;t be explained.  So God, time, space, and all matter (and anti-matter), as I see, could never have the power to create itself from pure nothingness (meaning not even space, entirely void of even the small subatomic particle, exists).  God...sorry, but while certain life experiences and &quot;feelings&quot; (the kind of feeling that...feels, or senses) have me believe you may be lurkin&#39;, I can&#39;t believe you created yourself.  You might be omnipotent, but that&#39;d only be after the fact. It&#39;d impossible to for you to even have the thought &quot;Hey, I want to exist&quot; if you don&#39;t yet.<br><br>Okay, so we&#39;ve established that it&#39;s impossible for anything, including empty space to exist.  With that in mind, the purely confident statement of truth I believe is entirely accurate, is: Something&#39;s going on.<br><br>Moving on from that, since there&#39;s so much evidence that everything adheres to a cycle, then the universe must as well.  I believe astrophysicists&#39; popular theory is that the universe is expanding.  If so, then I&#39;d guess that expansion is only one phase of its cycle.  It either expands so much it reconvenes on the other side of infinite space, or some other cosmic phenomenon causes it to eventually reverse from expanding to contracting, eventually causing it to all collect again, via the mega-ultra-as-big-as-the universe-plus-some, super duper massive black hole, which gets us back to that same phat and jiggly ball.  Which in turn, probably hangs in that state for a few, until it gets either bored and/or antsy, increasing its baseline jigglyness, until it gets a hot under the collar (I might get a hair ticked off too if I was just floating in the middle of nowhere, for like 80 octillion years), heats up, causing all the atomic friction we like so much, until it just can&#39;t take it no more, and...BAM.  You might see where I&#39;m headed here.<br><br>So, I submit, that everything, every element of existence, even mental (the guy with the headphones mentioned something about psychological processes...or something cognitive processes based) doesn&#39;t merely &quot;acquire&quot; a cycle, as the result of its existence.  I propose that it may be the foundation or the source or precursor to its existence.<br><br>Mike Myers (Austin Powers), who was once an SNL cast member, played a Scottish merchant character.  In the skit he would say, &quot;If it&#39;s not Scottish, it&#39;s CRAP!&quot;.  I&#39;m pretty darn close to feeling the same way about a cyclic precursor or foundational matrix being the only thing that matters...everything else (except maybe Scottish made materials and consumer products)...is CRAP!<br><br>Okay, I kind of lost there for a minute, but don&#39;t blame me.  The vid did it.  It inspired free thinking and that can happen.  In fact, while I haven&#39;t done a formal trend analysis, it might happen at regular intervals.  Even if they were irregular intervals, they&#39;re still intervals.  And again, we might just need to pull back a half a hair more, and like displayed depiction of a beating heart, it&#39;s a regular rhythm, it has unique patterns, peaks, blips an&#39; stuff...within each beat cycle.  So maybe my aforementioned loss of sanity is just as essential as the Yin is to the Yang.  One defines the other.  Insanity is defined by its opposite.  That&#39;s kiiind of another subject, but I would like to say, if you&#39;ll permit me, that maybe I wasn&#39;t speaking pure gibberish when speaking of the impossibility of anything.  &#39;Cause let&#39;s face it.  For anything to exist, it has to also not exist.  IOW, if the entire universe was &quot;chair&quot;, and there was nothing else, we wouldn&#39;t really thinking straight if we called the only thing that exists &quot;chair&quot; (the thing we humans invented to sit on).  It&#39;s the fact that a chair doesn&#39;t exist that allows it to exist.  Sense exists only because nonsense exists.  And it might get interesting here:  Space might only be able to exist if it also doesn&#39;t exist.  As I said...my base concrete statement containing what I believe to be the highest definition of the word &quot;fact&quot;, is that...something&#39;s going on.<br><br>It&#39;s no new theory that maybe nothing exists outside my mind.  My mind and cognitive thought processes might have created the whole of the universe.  Or...I might just be dreaming.  Hey...when I hit they hay at night and dream, with only one exception, I don&#39;t even consider that I&#39;m dreaming during the dream.  The dream is just life.  But when I wake up, it&#39;s...oh, I was dreaming, and am so convinced I&#39;ve awoken to actual life, I don&#39;t often consider it to be anything else. But with the understanding that obviously our minds are sophisticated enough to create what we perceive as &quot;reality&quot;, so well that we don&#39;t even suspect differently, then that A) says a lot about our mind&#39;s capacity to fool us, time and time again, and B) Has us consider that what we think of as &quot;life&quot; might be just another level of dream state.  It could be when we &quot;die&quot;, we simply return to a state of being that doesn&#39;t surprise us in the slightest...just like we&#39;re not surprised when waking from a nightly dream.<br><br>Which brings me to the psychological mention of the gentlemen with headphones.  It supports a consideration that I&#39;ve had for many years.  That A) Reincarnation, <b>may</b> a thing.  or B) Not so much reincarnation, but whatever&#39;s responsible for me consciously living this life, perceived internally.  IOW, I sometimes wonder why the world isn&#39;t exactly the way it is, only me (Terry), am not experiencing Terry&#39;s life from his internal perspective.  I wasn&#39;t any of the uncountable people who lived in the past (to my recollection, at least), so what is it that&#39;s attributable for me consciously living and looking out past these eyeballs at life, from the inside?  Since that question&#39;s not easy to answer, I&#39;d like to conclude with another proposal.  Since my internal perception of Terry&#39;s life is the basis for my only confident pure truth statement, that something&#39;s going on, it&#39;s not too much of a stretch to consider that...if this internal conscious perception of Terry&#39;s life has <b>definitely</b> occurred, why might it not happen again?

He was killed on the cross as payment for the sins of all mankind, three days later He rose from the dead. Forty days later He ascended into heaven where He sits at the right hand of the Father. He is returning very soon, but before He does, Satan, the devil, is coming to pretend to be Jesus/God. Satan is an angel, and he will have certain supernatural powers with which to try to fool everyone. He will, for example, be able to make fire come down from heaven in the sight of men. He will only be on earth a short time before the real King of Kings, Jesus Christ, God in the flesh, returns. When the real Jesus comes we will all be transformed into our spiritual bodies at the same moment. Jesus came in the flesh to offer forgiveness of sins and eternal life to anyone who believes and calls on His precious name!<br><br>if thou shalt confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus, and shalt believe in thine heart that God hath raised him from the dead, thou shalt be saved. - Romans 10:9<br><br>Now when Jesus was in Bethany, in the house of Simon the leper, There came unto him a woman having an alabaster box of very precious ointment, and poured it on his head, as he sat at meat. But when his disciples saw it, they had indignation, saying, To what purpose is this waste? For this ointment might have been sold for much, and given to the poor. When Jesus understood it, he said unto them, Why trouble ye the woman? for she hath wrought a good work upon me. For ye have the poor always with you; but me ye have not always. For in that she hath poured this ointment on my body, she did it for my burial. Verily I say unto you, Wheresoever this gospel shall be preached in the whole world, there shall also this, that this woman hath done, be told for a memorial of her. - Matthew 26:6-13<br><br>Seek ye the LORD while he may be found, call ye upon him while he is near: Let the wicked forsake his way, and the unrighteous man his thoughts: and let him return unto the LORD, and he will have mercy upon him; and to our God, for he will abundantly pardon.<br><br>To anoint your self, the sick, or a building for spiritual protection:<br>Get a small bottle of olive oil and pour off a small amount into a smaller vessel like a vial or baby food jar.

If everything has the same quality (value) (an infinity of ones), is it qualitative order? In a model with an infinity of entities, if one entity has all the value (one infinity) is it qualitative chaos because the quality is not evenly distributed?

That characterization was debunked within months of its coining.  But its pithy and the media, and unfortunately, scientists tend to glom onto it.   Disorder implies the opposite of order\u2026 and entropy is neither.  Entropy is the tendency for ENERGY to DISPERSE.   That\u2019s it.   Energy wants to disperse at a maximal rate.   And if more energy can disperse thru an emergent order, then Entropy will favor the emergence of order. More complex molecules form from atoms because the molecule has a lower energy state and heat is released- i.e. Energy disperses.  Convective loops form because they disperse energy more efficiently. And  Living systems disperse energy faster than non-living systems, so entropy favors the emergence of order when order disperses more energy than disorder.  The coining of disorder came from the observation that two gasses in separate volumes would MIX, but that a mixed gas would not UNMIX. And the Unmixed arrangement was characterized as being More \u2018ordered\u2019.    Its not.  Its literally artificially ordered.  And mixed gasses DO unmix in a high enough gravitational gradient by mass alone.   Gravity acts to pull mass together, concentrating energy.

However, both Russia&#39;s kleptocrats and their secret allies, our own kleptocrats, remain in power. Russia&#39;s kleptocratic, genocidal rulers were known for their atrocities FOR YEARS BEFORE these atrocities in Ukraine: he was just committing genocide against Muslims then, so it was ok.<br><br>His enablers, our &quot;Federal&quot; Reserve banksters and trillionaires, fear any economic catastrophe that may take away their golden goose, the right to print US dollars of the &quot;Fed&quot; and its right to gift them to banksters/cronies funds through ultra low interest rate loans, QE commissions, &quot;dividends&quot; that they &quot;earned&quot; by their diligent frauds on the American and EU people, etc. from them. Except for some stocks whose future prospects and price earnings ratios justify their prices, most stock market valuations of stocks are INSANE.<br><br>Massive market manipulation is occurring by the bankster-trillionaire families, probably to keep their &quot;Fed&quot; golden goose. Moreover, embarrassing facts are being quickly hidden: President&#39;s Zelenskyy&#39;s valiant heroism should not obscure the fact that the US, UK, and Russia reportedly, fraudulently &quot;guaranteed&quot; Ukraine&#39;s borders to get it to give up its nuclear weapons in the Budapest Memorandum.<br><br>Thereafter, our racist kleptocrats influenced the US government and EU to not sanction Russia significantly and build more economic ties with it despite its initial actions against Ukraine from 2012 to 2015, including its &quot;annexation&quot; (a.k.a. invasion and theft of the Crimea.&quot;) I guess with our &quot;guarantee&quot; to Ukraine and $5, you can buy a cup of coffee, which cup is worth more than our &quot;guarantee&quot; was.<br><br>J&#39;accuse: for YEARS, Russia did not rearm to invade its other neighbors in secret or hide its intentions: in the news and in newspapers any nerds like myself who like to read about its new weapons, including hypersonic missiles, small tanks operated remotely and maybe using AI targeting, etc., knew it was rearming frantically. Russia was allowed to continue selling weapons to the world with Western chips and technology, AFTER it had invaded and stolen Crimea.<br><br>Now, in front of big screen, CCP-slave factory made HDTVs, in plush sofas and chairs, we are watching the Ukrainian genocide, which will continue until the Ukrainians must stop as they run out of food. Putin&#39;s genocide must also be blamed on our inability to get rid of our kleptocrats like banksters, who were in or allied with organized crime and Russian organized crime (whose leader reportedly might be one of or the world leader of organized crime and is identified in Wikipedia!)

It is ours. <br><br>Actually, but for different reasons, it IS our fault but because we did NOT sufficiently arm Ukraine with enough F35s, missiles, Patriot missile batteries, etc., in 2014, 2015, 2016, 2017, 2018, 2019, or 2020 BEFORE 2021, by which time Putin&#39;s Russia was armed to the teeth and ready for this war. We should have given fleets of tanks to Ukraine, because they live at the point of the spear and for years, were our shield from Putin\u2019s expansionist dreams to reconquer Eastern Europe.<br><br>We are craven! We are not even willing to send our own fighters to shoot down Russian bombers dropping cluster bombs on Ukrainian civilians and so help Ukraine as we helped China against the Japanese with the Flying Tigers.

If he stays in power, expect Putin to invade the Baltic countries and then Poland or Romania next. <br><br>This will not be over, not even after Ukraine falls: this is not Putin\u2019s first genocide and, if he is not removed from power by enraged Russians, it will NOT be his last. He was a war criminal for years whom the Western kleptocrats and organized crime funded and kept in power, because he was just doing genocide against Muslims and others. By being docile and allowing our kleptocrats to remain in power, we have enabled the Russian fuel air explosive missiles which will soon kill thousands of Ukrainian children and women, along with men in large areas of Ukraine, whose bodies he will then burn in his mobile crematoriums --- like the thousands of Muslim men whom Putin has massacred for YEARS!", "comment_date": "2022-03-03T05:29:00Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Srekwah", "comment_text": "Creepy.", "comment_date": "2022-03-03T02:28:53Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Saco Cheio", "comment_text": "Air movement.

Not only that, but anything that even so much as <i>sounds</i> supernatural is often immediately thrown out like bathwater that couldn&#39;t possibly have any babies in it and blamed on illusion. While Occam&#39;s Razor often makes sense, it doesn&#39;t excuse invalidating whole concepts just because certain forms of them are suspect, like many classical and religion-oriented interpretations or bits thereof of what a soul could be like or even how d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu could work. Yeah, I&#39;m going there. Indeed, jumping to illusion often ends up creating merely a different sort of similarly tangled explanatory web from presuming supernatural cause, and that helps no one.

If this sounds like music, remember that prey depend upon unpredictability, and wolf MUST respond to that. In my experiments, wolves are soon bored by predictability, associating kinetic predictability with nonlife, even though their love for speed requiring instant reflexes supersedes that.<br> In humans we constantly find big bruiser fighters emphasizing controlling th e&quot;rhythm&quot; of a fight. It is so that unpredictability can be suddenly introduced. Oppositely, a wolf is subject to constant unpredictability. <br><br>Understand that this is a COGNITIVE phenomenon, and points toward some neural rhythm. One CAN find alternative balances aside from unison, but sensitivity to humans leaning toward you and maintenance of distance is involved.<br><br>Brains are heuristic-forming organs, and the MOST necessary characteristic is to constantly create the least error-prone condensations of experience we can. THIS is the game of brains.<br><br>But what you are seeing in the US politically , is high effort to entrain you to simplistic heuristic responses , directed by dominants.<br>This is a MASSIVE aberration from individuality and democratic useful function.<br><br>It is the DIFFERENCES in a large group that allows large groups to make more accurate decisions than individuals or small groups.<br><br>To FOLLOW is to create a SMALL group from a large, which, as you will understand below somewhere, is hormonal, dominance-submissive, and dangerous, as it is shown all the time that the best decisions come from creating the largest group. Only fast decisions coming from a single source also has utility,<br>Their PROBLEM is dependence upon OLD heuristics, beliefs already established, which may NOT be appropriate for the novel events either individuals or groups face.<br><br>Entrainment is the scientific word for the process of moving toward, into, synchrony in all its forms. It is also a neural process, See Default Mode Network for recent work on this. DMN occurs during sleep states and when it is occurring suppression of motor action occurs. You will notice that suppression of somatic muscular response is NOT complete. In waking periods DMN is also activated suppressing some actions, andthis is important.<br>As i said of rhythm, moving in step, and things done in unison or in consonance - coherent divisions of unuison, those motor responses occurring in synchrony, in entrainment give human pleasure. <br><br>MOST probably because we are so almost Eusocial. Other social animals (outside of the only other eusocial animal, the naked mole rat, who has a big queen seeming to control her colony. Many species show dominants suppressing through pheromones and aggressive behaviors, the hormones of others.<br><br>Humans do this, with a bunch of variants.<br><br>Present - as opposed to absent- fathers suppress the puberty and sexual activity of daughter. Older brothers and aggressive fathers suppress the puberty of younger smaller brothers. Present fathers having a baby changes the FATHER&#39;s hormones and consequently, to varying extents, the behaviors of the father, if he remains present. While testosterone is DECREASED, a hormone increasing aggression toward those exterior to the family , is INCREASED.<br><br>In mole rats, we find dispersing males, with whom the queens prefer sex. In humans we get the fathers resisting the reduction of testosterone who increase cheating, closeness with young leaving the family.<br><br>THe peculiar influence of entrainment and synchrony of humans to dominance-oriented humans, is of interest. <br><br>Their false familial cognition toward outsiders, and submission toward a permanent dominant is an absolute mystery to me, at least. I have neither sought dominance in the group activities and businesses, in which I participated, even when supervising 30 people. <br><br>Brains function best when allowed to be MOST attentive to the present- see wolves, as well as your increased perception of small variance in time - and to make adjustments to beliefs. The repetitious synchrony of metronomes, and other nonliving, boring processes, ALWAYS in the end, make us seek asynchrony. The most exciting activities of life are those through which we discover synchronies, NOT perform dull, synchronous actions.. <br><br>Humans have found a place in between, with our biggest problem being entrained, hypnotized, dulled by the demand of others that we be synchronous , subject to another&#39;s bigger pendulum.<br><br>Complex systems can have novel emergences, to a point. Since systems in reality are never closed, they either simplify and disappear or become chaotic, and sometime disappear, as do chaotic. Chaotic mathematics and systems DO tend to show NEAR-repetition, NEVER completely repeating.<br><br>You don&#39;t GET what you used to have, though that is the preference of the old and the dominance-oriented.<br><br>And NO art or activity that is completely synchronous is pleasurable after a few repetitions. As you learn something, you may apply it, but neither you nor any systematic  repetitious thing you impose , will last at it.<br> variation is life. THIS is why religions pretending to teleology, to infallibility, to formulaic ritual, to predictability - having a &quot;right&quot; answer, t diminishing and stultifying your brain (only Crom has the answer - WRONG! you are suppressing your own inquisitive brain) are deadends, why social systems MUST change, why what&#39;s dominant in ANY ecosystem changes.<br><br>So, do NOT be suckered into beliefs that synchrony is a final solution. Move the differently set metronomes sufficiently apart, so that both can swing to their fullest.<br> (and if you had not IMMEDIATELY noticed that the arc of one metronome is SUPPRESSED by the other, you either do now, or you need help in SEEING itself.

The other distinction depends on whether the &quot;whole&quot; of which you are speaking is a singular, organic, thus an animate whole in se, or is it merely a discrete whole, as, e.g., a bag/bridge full of people, or a bag of atoms of a particular inanimate element, each  a whole unto itself according as the &quot;kind&quot; of thing that it is, exhibiting its properties according to its nature.   The parts of a living being, for example, taken alone, cannot even exist without the whole having been posited in existence to begin with.  So, in this case, the whole is &quot;more&quot;, or &quot;greater&quot;, if you will, than any of the parts taken alone, which, as I said would not even have itself as a kidney or kidney cell, or a singular blood cell, or any other part.  For left &quot;alone&quot;, outside of its organic wholeness, these parts will begin to decompose into distinct elemental things having themselves differently than when the life principle was present and maintaining the whole as a whole living thing...not a pile of non living elements. The life principle explains each of the parts, whether still part of the vivified whole or not;  the parts do not explain the whole; they are there by natural necessity, flowing from the thing&#39;s nature. Inanimate things, those things which do not have living principles, but inert, or inanimate, e.g., a bag of silver atoms; the quantity of atoms in the bag, however is only accidental....each is still an atom of silver neither greater or lesser in nature, each atom is a silver atom.  So I think you are asking the wrong question. Synchronicity is not a property, for property flows from a thing&#39;s nature. Synchronicity, in other words is not part of the nature of any whole; it does not explain an thing&#39;s nature, or any of a whole thing&#39;s parts....it is what Aristotle/Aquinas referred to as pure &quot;accidents&quot;. You and I may not be the same height, weight, complexion, standing, sitting, or what have you, which do not explain our nature. More than one human being on a foot-bridge does not change any human being&#39;s nature and thus the properties which flow from that nature which is essence &quot;in act&quot;. So, again, properties flow from a thing&#39;s nature, its essence, necessarily, essence being that which makes a thing the kind of thing that it is.", "comment_date": "2021-09-30T14:30:59Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Robert Groff", "comment_text": "Would this explain how crickets all start or all stop at the same time?", "comment_date": "2021-09-30T13:55:46Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "JebClang", "comment_text": "The answer is equilibrium.

For this explanation we will call it the Snowflake Effect, thought it is three axis intentionally the Rubik Effect. Dimensional Intentional, anyways, by the 3rd dimension it is the Rubik Effect. This is at the subatomic level that this comes from.

This is why metronome within a certain distance will synchronize.  It is the same reason women living in proximity will synchronize menstrual cycles.  It is why spouses will sometimes have what is known as sympathy pains.  It is why twins (who have a greater subatomic link), even tough separated at birth will end up living near each other or will prefer the same type meals or wear the same type clothing.<br><br>The programming is beneath the Micro-Sub-Atomic Level to bring order or to maintain order or to restore order.  We have never found Undirected Evolution in any location in the cosmos. Everything Is Directed. This is why you do not have humans with feathers or alligators with human faces or dogs with human feet.  If Uncontrolled Chaos was real, you would have about 8 million blends of feature within each species on your planet. Let me be clear, if Uncontrolled Evolution (Natural Selection) were true, for every featured variation that every one of the 8+ million species earth has, each individual species would have that total number of variations of features. There would be literally multiples of millions of chaotically different humans on your planet and it would be the same for Ducks, Dogs, Cats, Bats, Hawks and so on for the 8+ million species you have on your planet.

I knew that energy dispersal to one side would make something move the opposite way, but never knew why pretty much everything would synchronize. I heard a long time ago that &quot;nature abhors imbalance, and will do whatever it takes to maintain balance,&quot; which - to me - also included synchronization. Why does this happen, and why do we fall into it? I have the ability to keep perfect time, so using that, I began observing myself moving around others and even interacting with objects. There were times when we would move in sync without consciously doing it. My brain would click over into &quot;hey! look at this!&quot; and I&#39;d be like, &quot;Wow. I did not mean to do that.&quot; Trying to force myself out of that energy bond with the other person/thing took effort. I didn&#39;t know why it was so hard for me to break that connection. <br><br>I was about 15 when I used this idea of synchronicity to try to invent hovercoversion /a repulsorlift/an antigrav unit, because I wanted a hover car. That&#39;s it. I wanted to drive a hovercar (which ties into my dream of flying a spaceship. I&#39;m a nerd). I attempted to figure out different gravitational frequencies vs. that of the vehicle, and thought that if I could somehow get the unit to &#39;vibrate&#39; fast enough through rapid synchronicity (while not also vibrating the car), then the vehicle could repel the gravitational force of the planet. Once accomplished, that repulsion would need to be controlled. Needless to say, I obviously couldn&#39;t do it. this is way too far ahead in technological advances, into the realm of sci-fi, and WAY TOO FAR out of my mental league - and likely incorrect anyway - but my little 15 year old self gave herself headaches trying to figure it out. And I never forgot those experiments. I use this &quot;Fake science&quot; as fact in my sci-fi novel, because it&#39;s my universe, and I can. :) Might as well use it somewhere.<br><br>I guess my science class&#39;s involvement in the Marsville project gave me the idea that I could do this. (I was part of the water reclamation team. We found multiple ways of getting water to our Martian colony that included working with hydroponics, and waste management. I know. Ew. We were all 13 and 14 year olds. We set up the fake colony on an air force base, which always made me wonder if they were watching us, took some of our more salient ideas, and expanded on them. We were all kids, but kids tend to have the most vivid imaginations that aren&#39;t heavily blocked by internal criticism, or a heavy logic filter. Their ideas might sound crazy, but sometimes there&#39;s a nugget of brilliance in them. ...And sometimes they&#39;re just nuts. :) )<br><br>I may suck at basic algebra, and couldn&#39;t solve a scientific problem to save my life, but science is cool, and I still want to know why things are the way they are.", "comment_date": "2021-09-19T17:52:50Z", "likes_count": 7}, {"comment_by": "goricego", "comment_text": "<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-_VPRCtiUg&amp;t=19m29s\">19:29</a> &quot;The whole is more than the sum of its parts&quot; - Gestalt", "comment_date": "2021-09-19T17:48:37Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "CarimboHanky", "comment_text": "dont know how this video ended on my feed but im not even mad really interesting", "comment_date": "2021-09-19T17:37:26Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Tyler Nelson 310", "comment_text": "The universe computer cant process stuff happening at the same time, so it forces them to happen at the same time, why cant we be put onto a better processor?", "comment_date": "2021-09-19T17:06:52Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Shreekrishna Ban", "comment_text": "Ok I&#39;m spending my life understanding you &amp; it would take next 3 more generations to understand your son..", "comment_date": "2021-09-19T16:48:40Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Kyznar", "comment_text": "The Surprising Secret of Synchronization?

I will state quite plainly that what you have in nearly all of these phenomenon is a localized minimum of potential.  It is not quite the same as entropy.  Entropy is merely a state in which things nicely space out to the point at which those localized disturbances in potential disappear.  So think of it like this, why doesn&#39;t ALL water drain into the same &quot;lowest&quot; Ocean?  The answer is that there are localized barriers where addition of energy would be required to pass over and then flow down to the global lowest potential Ocean.  That is why we have lakes and puddles.  But these are cases of static barriers.  What happens with these complex systems is that you are dealing with dynamic barriers that tend to oscillate over time.  It is one of the reasons that string theory is so good at mathematically modeling stuff - because every string has an inherent resonant frequency as a property of it&#39;s length and it&#39;s terminus states.  BUT in the case of these systems, the energy required to maintain the status quo (Newton&#39;s law) is always REDUCED by acting in synchrony.  At a mechanical level, it is gross physical forces as you say with the pendulums.  But in the case of the people walking on the bridge, it is also that they can maintain the status quo (remaining upright) with less energy by counter-acting the lateral sway with a wider stance, thus imparting more lateral forces into the bridge with each step.  This may, in fact, be the key to understanding the constant speed of EM energy which travels as &quot;waves&quot;, i.e., oscillating particles.   Getting back to that example I didn&#39;t like about the runner on the track, when you recognize that for many (not all) people, maintaining pace is not a costless process, then by linking pace to someone else&#39;s pace, you gain back that energy that was previously being diverted from the act of running to the act of pace tracking and maintenance and that can now lead to more efficient running.  In the example of an economy, that could be an explanation to why markets move in seemingly non-random ways.  Rather than expend energy into deciphering oceans of financial statements, isn&#39;t it just simpler to follow a trend or listen to the analyst recomendation.  Even though rational people who understand information pricing theory should NOT do that!  And with respect to infectious diseases coming in wave after wave, it is the same kind of thing - assessing risk directly and individually costs too much on the phsyche so that the society is prone to act in concert in ways that will lead to oscillation (the expert says it&#39;s safe, so everybody goes out and more infections happen... then the expert says it&#39;s not safe so everybody stays home and infections drop).

Just observe. It&#39;s very hard to do for an adult that has already &quot;learned&quot; all those ideas about how things work. So the first step would be to understand that the universe really is one thing, it&#39;s really everything. If you have no concept of boundaries within the universe you could theoretically understand it, I guess. But that would make living in our society impossible as you wouldn&#39;t be able to differentiate between yourself and the world or different &quot;things in the world&quot; like colours and shapes. You would only see &quot;everything&quot;. It&#39;s mind bending to think about it and probably doesn&#39;t help anyone but I believe that we might as well give up as nobody will ever understand a &quot; complex system&quot; in its entirety, at the very least not the way we are today.

It was something I&#39;ve never seen before. I&#39;m Italian and in Italy, despite how long the applause lasts, it never gets in sync. In Russia, instead, when the public is very happy for what they&#39;ve seen (for example at a theater) of course they applaude for a longer time and, at some point, they start clapping in sync. Which is, as I&#39;ve already said, something that I&#39;ve never experienced in Italy in 19 years.

His analogy with <i>&quot;friends who run around a track and adjust speed to each other out of sympathy&quot;</i> is stupid because neither emotions nor intellect has anything to do with synchronizing metronomes. The correct explanation is much simpler: Each metronome has a potential energy defined by its current position angle (&quot;phase&quot;). The metronomes transfer their potential energy towards the movable supporting bar which connects them, and that bar distributes that energy to all metronomes, thereby causing synchronization of phases.<br><br>His claim, <i>&quot;You might think, if you increase the coupling you gradually get the metronomes more and more synchronized: That is </i><b><i>not</i></b><i> what happens&quot;</i> is false, too. The coupling of the metronomes that stand on a bar of wood is achieved by transferring energy via friction between the bottom surface of the metronome and the wood bar.

Some of the heat must be lost to the environment until all the heat is gone. Entropy was a concept devised to quantify that energy loss. Entropy has gone on to become a far more abstract notion of order devolving into disorder, but it comes from those thermodynamic roots. <br><br>That said, the pedestrians producing bridge sway is more a proof of the 2nd law than a refutation. All that walking is, after all, adding tremendous energy to the system. Again, the metronomes will also prove the 2nd law in that they will eventually run out of energy and come to rest.

There are  other factors like Barhausen Criterion (Loop gain must =&gt;+1) It also depends on  phase compensation and phase/gain margin .  <br><br>Old TV CRT&#39;s worked with manual tuning the flyback oscillator so that it synced up to the TV signals.  This was an injection locked loop (ILL) like the pendulums. Then came stable crystal oscillators were used with Phase Locked Loops (PLL) with phase mixers and filters. The internet and telephony uses Stratum 1 to 3 synchronized clocks all synchronized to a Cesium global clock.  Then there are ATM&#39;s that are pleisiochronous or &quot;almost&quot; synchronous.  <br><br>The formula for this capture range is nonlinear partly from positive feedback and because of the Barkhausen criteria where damped oscillations may get amplified to sustain oscillations such that the loop gain must be &gt;=+1 After which soft limiting stress keeps it a more or less sine wave and dampens the oscillation to be steady like the Wein (Wien?) Oscillator.   <br><br>The harmonic content of bridge failures is because Civil engineers didn&#39;t understand what EE&#39;s already knew about harmonic content (THD) and intermodulation (IM) distortion, where nonlinear materials create sub-harmonic (sum  and ) difference frequencies. This is fundamental to all radio design. (no pun intended). <br><br> The theory of the whole being greater than the sum of the parts is also a passion to me and my son who described to me his theory that global consciousness of brain waves sometimes matches the Schuman frequencies of upper ionospheric magneto resonance from solar flares pinging the magnetic ring fields around earth and some get into sync like the old TV Hsync injection oscillators.", "comment_date": "2021-04-30T13:33:00Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "markhrabe", "comment_text": "Aren\u2019t Jupiter\u2019s moons spinning in a 1,2,4 motion based on Kemplars law?", "comment_date": "2021-04-30T13:28:05Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "\u0674", "comment_text": "Simply think in terms of vibrations, vibration should he evenly distributed along the system, it can only be achieved when in sync.", "comment_date": "2021-04-30T12:54:42Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Andrew Stevenson", "comment_text": "If we all start the video at the same time...   then pause and play every second, maybe we could crash Google&#39;s servers???  \ud83d\ude1c", "comment_date": "2021-04-30T12:29:01Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Orphan Of Orbit", "comment_text": "Life is a spiral towards balance.", "comment_date": "2021-04-30T11:30:29Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Vladimir Grom", "comment_text": "Bamboo flowers 1 time in 60-100years(IIRC) and no matter how far away they are, they flower at the same time on the whole planet", "comment_date": "2021-04-30T08:46:23Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Marcel Nehrig", "comment_text": "the art of syncronizing people and their actions independent of their believes by micro targeting social media input is standard modern warfare.", "comment_date": "2021-04-30T07:58:58Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "ValentineUnderscore", "comment_text": "The heart spirals just make me think if Uzamaki now.

Electrical engineers routines apply &quot;white noise&quot; (randomness) to a resonant system to determine its resonant frequency(s).<br>[2] When two timing sources are &quot;close&quot; in frequency, then something called a &quot;beat&quot; frequency results from the difference between the two frequencies. For example, if one is 0.1% different from the other (i.e. &quot;close&quot;), then there should be one &quot;beat&quot; every 1000 cycles. If 0.01% apart, then 10000, etc. Now if that frequency is from something slow, like a metronome or pendulum, say 1/sec, then you would have to wait 10000 sec (about 2.8 hours) before they sync, but only &quot;momentarily&quot;, before they start to drift away. Then there&#39;s the &quot;anti-beat&quot; when they&#39;re motions are synced oppositely, at half the time, but repeats at the same frequency of once/2.8 hr. Now that also assumes that these are perfect timing systems with no animalities to throw a stick into the spokes, otherwise, more chaos ensues. Now multiply that to say 50 metronomes.

Why would pendulums hanging from clocks be any different?\r<br><br>O_o<br><br>Maybe I&#39;m a physics savant, who just never studied physics. Or maybe Huygens had an off day at work :P<br><br>Edit: Seriously, how do people not immediately just see how this works? What causes the effect? I am starting to think I&#39;ve wasted my youth in the wrong career.<br><br>No need for fancy explanations. The more a pendulum moves on an angle to gravity, the more it pulls whatever it is tethered to out of place. Simple so far, right? One could delve into it, but I think most who have used a swing can intuit it. When a swing is at the top, it can pull the whole swing frame out of place. Okay... So when a swing is at the top, it transfers energy to the frame it is tethered to. The frame then shifts perpendicularly to the ground. The shifting frame will transfer energy to other pendulums attached to it. The more parallelly to the ground a pendulum is moving, the more of the energy that the beam transfers to it results in movement because the frame is moving completely parallelly to the ground. If the pendulum is moving at 45 degrees to the ground, half of the energy transferred to it will be directed towards the ground, and just result in friction. The other half will result in movement along the axis that the pendulum is moving.<br><br>The frame transfers energy from pendulums moving perpendicularly to the ground to pendulums moving parallelly to the ground. The more perpendicular and parallel the motions are, the greater the effect. So energy is transferred until the pendulums are in sync.<br><br>The pendulums don&#39;t even have to be influencing the frame they are attached to to sync up. It is enough that the frame is moving fairly rhythmically, like from wind or waves. Pretty sure that is by far the biggest factor for pendulums on ships, for instance.<br><br>Huygens, you n00b.", "comment_date": "2021-04-17T08:24:23Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "M T", "comment_text": "When you look att the the turn signal on two different cars when they have stopped due to a traffic light.

(2) Express effect of the movement of n asynchronous pendulums on the movement of the platform.  (3) Express the effect of the movement of the platform on the movement of a pendulum.  (4) From 2 and 3, generate a system of equations for the cases with 1 and 2 pendulums.  (5) Solve for the equilibrium in a case with 1 and 2 pendulums, with arbitrary starting values.  (6) Show that the equilibrium does not change if you add 1 pendulum, regardless of the current number of pendulums.  Alternate proof framework:  (1) Prove that regardless of current state after one period an apparatus with 2 pendulums is closer to synchronous equilibrium by more than some fraction of the present distance to the synchronous equilibrium.  (2) Prove that for an arbitrary number of pendulums by induction.  (3) Prove that the sequence of distance to synchronous equilibrium indexed by period asymptotes to the 0.", "comment_date": "2021-04-15T18:22:37Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Brecht", "comment_text": "Yet at a concert when people use lighters or flashlights to swing left and right with there arms, nobody ever gets in sync...", "comment_date": "2021-04-15T18:06:55Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Fox Fairy", "comment_text": "Does free will really exist?", "comment_date": "2021-04-15T18:00:06Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "CAROME", "comment_text": "si con estos ejemplos ense\u00f1aran en el colegio todo seria distinto pero no lo hacen solo hacen ver todo lo aburrido q es la fisica", "comment_date": "2021-04-15T17:47:26Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Ian", "comment_text": "Aristoteles says that to reach God there are 3 paths, beauty, justice and kindness ...

Good job Veritasium!!.. The way u try ur best to down on earth and let common people understand you is very appreciated!. Hugh applause!!!..and then now let us put this theory on human..

There are so many of religion, so many million of Gods and so more invented by mankind, and all of it just make it divide us more and more and became hostile and randomise in religious. Right?. That is the first rule of theory is unsynchonize and randomness . And now the second rule is to became synchronization and unrandomness, to came down and settlement.. what will happen is sooner or later humankind can&#39;t be helped but to synchronise to believe in one true God! U know why? Because within this theory all randomness unsynchronise of matter will come to one point the great synchonization..Right?. Do u see it?. U are very smart person. U should see it. Its ONE! No matter two object collide..they will became one as a pair..two pair collide it will became double cycle pair.. The number will grow. And they will always became one . This thing is happen because the single basic atom is from one neutron and one proton. From randomness of atomic world of proton/neutron either way they all will find their pair just to became one. They need to submit to the great attraction. And eventually they will decay but for the purpose to became one! Just like religion! Why people invented religious or Gods if there are non approval act of God? Unless their are. Right! The One God always exist. This great synchronization is a way to tell human its only One True God. U can find it with ur smart brain. The sign is very clear as bright of daylight! And its Islam is the approval way of life under His law. And sure did community of Islam will always appreciate the person so bright like. To unlock the secret of universe. And that was just only a drop of water in the vast ocean of knowledge of God Allah s.w.t itself! Dont be so late to get into sync bruh. And this might be ur call to join the pilgrimage.

When we walked up the street, the locals and even each other could notice our association as non-locals by the marching &#39;in-step&#39; drill that had been burnt into our brain by strenuous repetition. So in only a few steps, completely unintentionally, we (say a group of 10) would naturally all be &#39;in-step&#39; with everyone&#39;s left leg stepping altogether followed by the right in perfect cadence. It was a main reason why one of our weekend leave conditions were not to walk together in more than 3 or 4 person groups. You&#39;ll be surprised  how intimidating a group people just walking together with a trained synchronized reinforcement can appear to regular civilians. It kind of subconsciously triggers people&#39;s primitive Fight-Flight-or-Freeze responce as your subconscious side of your brain runs the numbers on the size and possible threat of the new, possibly dangerous unknown &#39;tribe&#39;.

I&#39;ve spend a lot of time arguing with virtually all my friends that the fact that we only see one side of the moon supports (proves) the thesis that the moon does NOT rotate on its axis. Think about it as a hammer which an athlete swings around themselves - there&#39;s literally no axis you can spin the ball around, which would not cause the chain to swirl around itself or the ball, even if you use the one that begins at the point where the ball and the chain are attached. I don&#39;t of course object to the fact that the moon is rotating, relative to the rest of the objects in space, but that rotation is only defined by the motion of the moon through space and not around its axis. What I am trying to say is that it actually rotates around the Earth&#39;s center, for the reasons described in the video. <br><br>The discussions I mentioned were terminated, because they always became circular with no agreement ever reached. My friends always appealed to authority, which as suggested in the video always supported their statement. But what is authorities are wrong? <br><br>In the end it seems like the argument comes down to the definition of what rotation around the axis is, but is there actually a point to argue about in this definition? What strikes me more than my friends refusing to see my argumented point is that when I took the question to older people, they were supportive of my point of view. I clearly remember that we were taught in school (Bulgaria during the 90s) that the Earth rotates around its axis while the moon does not.

Great video at first, but not after watching it. First, it seems way too convoluted and misleading. Each metronome has a weight and a force sharing the same material they are standing on, hence transfering some of their momentum with each other and so they are &quot;kicking against&quot; other metronomes that are not synced and so the fewer/smaller/lighter and/or out of synced ones will be kicked until they stand in line, reaching equillibrium, which this basically the focus of this video. Equilibrium. Different forces pushing against each other until they all &quot;agree&quot;.  That should be the whole video...<br><br>But it&#39;s not. Again, it&#39;s really simple, but this video makes it way overly compex and even mystical with the long format and music. And the claps in the theathre example a something entirely different phenomenon; as in that case the &#39;metronomes&#39; (people) are changing their rythm on their own free will based on not just hearing others, but <b>expecting (and adjusting to the)</b> &#39;expected/calculated to be agreed upon&#39; rythm. There are no physichal forces present (yeah, sound pressure, bla bla) but they have <b>intelligence and choice</b> there. So yeah, it&#39;s a crap example by all means.<br><br>Moving on, many examples are trying to justify, even mystify this simple physics-based, logical, calculated interaction with something like the highest common denominator. For an educational video, it fails spectacularly.<br><br>Let&#39;s take that bridge with say 300 people on it stepping completely randomly. No movement at all. But even if let&#39;s say 10 (or even 2) people starts stepping at the same time (synchronized), they are already generating a force that is affecting every other people on that bridge. And when the number of people reaches critical mass, even neutral people are become part of the wobble if they don&#39;t forcefully move against it and just &quot;go with the flow&quot;.<br><br>And once the bridge is wobbling, it makes it much simpler to walk in a way that&#39;s aligned with others than it is to try to break stride (sync) as it means less force to do so.<br><br>But where I really lost is was yout line of &quot;it wasn&#39;t people walking in sync that got the bridge to wobble, it was the wobbling bridge that got people to walk in sync&quot; is completely garbage! It&#39;s not a chicken or the egg debacle, it&#39;s a simple cause and effect solution! That bridge without people would not have wobbled at all! It was the few initial people (in sync) starting the wobble while others followed them and their sync by doing just as little as not moving against them! Because it&#39;s much easier physcally to lean into a force than to go against it (hence the positive feedback loop), which is what made the whole bridge wobble. And even if someone isn&#39;t moving, their body is just &quot;dead weight&quot; adding to the wobble, as the human body is much more &#39;jiggly&#39; than concrete.<br><br>It&#39;s all simple physics and math, yet you managed to blow this up with tons of irrelevant, even incorrect examples and &quot;answers&quot; and even mystifing the whole thing.<br><br>Bonus: The ship example is also completely irrelevant and the sentece of &quot;A moon starts out with its own gravitational frequency&quot; was just also a ridiculousl oversimplification.<br><br>For an educational video, this is all unacceptable.

Why? Because our nature properties is fractal-geometry based, therefore, it is always repeat the &#39;first itself&#39;+add one unknown-component (properties in this case).  Apply this fractal geometry formula: Z(N) +1=Z(N) on the power of 2,+C (N=unknown number) (Z= first properties of the whole in this case)..Now, we don&#39;t know yet the unknown properties, but easy to determinate if we analyze the first to &#39;original properties&#39; of the whole (the first two shake of the bridge in this case) and determinate the difference of the two analyzed properties between the old and new ones, so we have the unknown component to add to the original one. .

Rules are involved in the sequencing of the geese or the firing of the flies, which may not appear capable of producing the synchrony, but which nonetheless result in a self-organizing system. There is no &quot;physical property&quot; required for the fireflies except the simple rule that individual flies begin synchronizing with other individuals in close proximity. The synchrony requires a certain amount of time to take shape, but there are agents--the flies, or the geese, etc., each of which only requires a very small number of rules to govern their behavior to permit the larger effect of the self-organizing group.  With the metronomes, there are no agents that make adjustments. Rather, gravity/movement causes the variation of the pendulums&#39; patterns, even if in barely discernible amounts on each swing. <br>The simultaneous applause is not at all an example of the natural examples of synchrony. This kind of applause is very common in Europe (I have never experienced it in America, but a friend of mine says she has).  In Europe, it is a culturally defined behavior. People seek an encore from a soloist by permitting synchronous applause to be achieved. But any two or three people, able to clap loudly, are able to evoke this behavior. The alacrity with which it comes to be shows that people are responding to the auditory cues. There is nothing &quot;self-organizing&quot; about it. Try to bring this off in a hall where people are not aware of the semiotics of synchronous clapping and it will not take place (I&#39;ve tried and failed).  In Europe, once people begin to hear it, they immediately conform. In other words, the example is altogether unrelated to what is happening with the metronomes, though it is someone closer to the fireflies.  <br>Perhaps you could reexamine the characteristics that relate to self-organizing systems in a future episode, making sure the phenomenology is uniform among the examples. Personally, I think Stephen Wolfram&#39;s examples of self-organizing automata offer concrete and visually compelling instances of this, while also permitting the effects of perturbations to be perceived.

In other words, beyond what Einstein realized, perhaps it actually is possible to know something to be simultaneous across vast distances. The limitation is only that it takes a lot of time to establish and maintain the scope of the domain. The continuous milling about of the individuals within limited areas would seem to be essential. Consider establishing such a synchrony field, and then performing your &quot;1-way speed of light&quot; calculations using the synchronous field as an additional reference. Consider whether such &quot;fireflies&quot; have already been dispersed and synchronized across vast fields. Could we identify them? Is there anything they&#39;d be useful for?

All of our science courses tell us the way to solve a problem it to break it down in smaller parts and analyse the parts. And that has been phenomenally successful for every branch of science. But the great frontier in science today is what happens when you try to go back? TO PUT THE PARTS TOGETHER AND UNDERSTAND THE WHOLE.. That&#39;s the field of complex systems. That&#39;s why we don&#39;t understand the immune system very well, we don&#39;t understand consciousness very well, or the economy... It&#39;s like the whole is more than the sum of its parts.&quot;<br><br>To me, this is where traditional medicine has an edge over Western science. Because in those cultures they see the mind or the body as a whole. It only works well when parts are in balance, harmony and working together. No one link is more important than another! A chain is only as strong as its weakest link.

I have been thinking a lot about how order spontaneously emerged in the Universe given the statistical tendency towards disorder, and you have provided me with an answer to my question (although I suspect there are more). I guess it really does come down to &quot;ask, and you shall receive&quot;. <br><br>Mind you, my intuition screams that this is only a partial answer to that question, and that there are several other forces or phenomena at work which allow for the culmination of order within entropic systems. Essentially, I&#39;m not convinced by the idea of inevitable heat death. Don&#39;t get me wrong, I understand the 2nd thermodynamic law reasonably well, if more as a statistical phenomenon than as a chemical one, and I can articulate the concept to others through a physical demonstration (using eggs and their case). However, my intuition refuses the leap between the likelihood of energy distribution becoming maximally equitable throughout a system, and the certainty that this will happen throughout our entire Universe. The claim seems to rest on too many assumptions, namely that the Universe behaves as a statistically probabilistic system when viewed from afar. But if this were so, I just can&#39;t see how such deep levels of complex order emerged in the first instance. My gut is saying someone has gone wrong somewhere, or missed something, and your insights help to fuel that fire in my gut, and give me confidence to pursue that curiosity intellectually. <br><br>I would also like to add how consistently fantastic your content is, and has always been, and how very deeply I admire you.

So thankyou so much for your content, and for enabling me to find something that I love. I have a little plastic ball with a white squiggle on it that I look at when I get occasionally down, and it reminds me that the world isn&#39;t so bleak, and that there are really great people out there doing very positive things in spite of it all.

Passionate about electronics. I enjoy creating circuits; including many available here on YouTube.  I  have many in opperation all across my bench top play area; laboratory. <br>For example a model radio transmission tower; flashing LED lights at  top and mid sections.<br> Another circuit on the bench, a red and blue police flasher, alternatingly pulsing each color rapidly several times before changing from one to the alternate color. <br>These circuits all have different rates of timing.  <br>I could not help but notice powering up the police flasher  any flashing LED circuits that drew power from  it&#39;s power sourse breadboard  will  eventually be flashing at the same rate regardless of it&#39;s design. Alone they  have very diffrrent patterns; flash rates designed for a specific affect; very slow, very fast,  and everything in between. Leave them  alone and soon  they are flashing in sync. Somewhat puzzling this phenomenon  makes sense. I presume it has to do with the fluctuations in the power draw of the circuits.  That is to say when a circuit A. for example is active there is less power available to the other circuits. When the circuit A. goes off between cycles there is a power surge. These rhythmic power fluctuations have to be the cause of the synchronizing.

Enertial energy (the inability to change direction due to your mass already under kinetic influence) is made when it reaches them points of building kinetic energy through potential, and begins to move the object passed what you would call hanging because unspent energy will stay and until it loses it through swinging, the bridge will be in a Lockheed of moving because of being all potential kinetic and inertial between swings.. and what happens here is it progressivly loses more than it gains all of this energy through its movement.. and unless you add more kinetic energy like the people walking did do, that is equal or more than that which earth tries to pull things still, the bridge will not move..<br><br>But c&#39;mon, the coolest part of thinking to do with equilibrium synchronisation, and energy in the universe has to be the energy of chemical reactions that formed us today...<br>And/or that power in which all conscious beings have on the reality that made us and how the way we perceive things after they happen had an affect on them whilst they happened.... the mind boggling last Thursday theory look it up geniuses... you know you were meant to read all of this you will realise it lol.. just next thursday...", "comment_date": "2021-04-03T11:57:12Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Himanshu Yadav", "comment_text": "Beyond science he also teaches how to be a good dad", "comment_date": "2021-04-03T11:49:04Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Claudia Muir", "comment_text": "The synchronized clapping is the audience asking for an encore.

Because they are close together, and rather heavy, the gravity of the two masses are pulling at each other, until they begin to synch up.<br><br>edit: damn", "comment_date": "2021-04-03T00:53:57Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Jasper", "comment_text": "Please explain synchronization vs synchronicity", "comment_date": "2021-04-03T00:53:31Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "NONO POPO", "comment_text": "as a drummer...I approve this logic.", "comment_date": "2021-04-03T00:39:12Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Stefan Carter", "comment_text": "A few days ago I started realising this, I was making a coffee and my sister had a song on, and a few days before that I started taking notes, whenever I tapped the spoon on the cup, I always ended up doing it in time to the best of the song, so I looked into it a bit more and it wasn\u2019t just me, i started to see everyone does it, if there is a constant pattern, it\u2019s a normal reaction to keep in time, and it\u2019s been hardwired into people, so it make sense that it is hardwired into the universe, people will always affect others and the same is for objects, if one is in close contact or proximity to another moving object, eventually they will sync up, is fascinating and I\u2019m so glad this popped up on my recommended", "comment_date": "2021-04-03T00:37:44Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Jamie B", "comment_text": "so happy to see nile red footage in this", "comment_date": "2021-04-03T00:36:50Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Dr Vinson", "comment_text": "Go back about 5,000 years to the walls of Jericho.

We\u2019ve lied, we\u2019ve stolen, we\u2019ve sinned sexually, and we\u2019ve taken His name in vain; which makes us liars, thieves, fornicators and blasphemers.. Yet this is only four of our many transgressions.<br><br>The problem is, we can never \u2018outweigh\u2019 our sin with good works because God is perfect in Holiness, meaning his standard is beyond our reach. He is also perfect in Justice, meaning, he will bring EVERY sin to light. The punishment for our sin is death, and Hell; a place of Eternal Fire, where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth.<br><br>Fortunately God is also perfect in Love, so 2000 years ago, Jesus Christ left his throne in heaven and came to this earth. While here, he lived a perfectly righteous life, only to take the punishment that We deserved; Our sinless creator became Our sin, and endured a gruesome death on a cross for our sake . <br>Right before he died, he said \u2018it is finished\u2019.. meaning, the debt for our sins has been paid in full. And on the third day, he defeated death and rose from the grave. So now, we can go free from the wrath of God\u2019s judgement not by earning it, but rather, as a free gift of grace ..<br><br>Except gifts can be either accepted or rejected. So this is what you must do in response; <br><br>Humbly admit to God that you have sinned against him, and through gratitude in the sacrifice of his son, repent (turn away) from your old way of life.

Yet this is only four of our many transgressions.<br><br>The problem is, we can never \u2018outweigh\u2019 our sin with good works because God is perfect in Holiness, meaning his standard is beyond our reach. He is also perfect in Justice, meaning, he will bring EVERY sin to light. The punishment for our sin is death, and Hell; a place of Eternal Fire, where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth.<br><br>Fortunately God is also perfect in Love, so 2000 years ago, Jesus Christ left his throne in heaven and came to this earth. While here, he lived a perfectly righteous life, only to take the punishment that We deserved; Our sinless creator became Our sin, and endured a gruesome death on a cross for our sake . <br>Right before he died, he said \u2018it is finished\u2019.. meaning, the debt for our sins has been paid in full. And on the third day, he defeated death and rose from the grave. So now, we can go free from the wrath of God\u2019s judgement not by earning it, but rather, as a free gift of grace ..<br><br>Except gifts can be either accepted or rejected. So this is what you must do in response; <br><br>Humbly admit to God that you have sinned against him, and through gratitude in the sacrifice of his son, repent (turn away) from your old way of life. Then, confess with your mouth that Jesus Christ is Lord, your savior, and the ruler of your life from this moment forward ( Romans 10:9 ). <br><br>Do these things, and you will be saved.<br><br>If you do so sincerely, God will grant you a new heart which no longer finds comfort in sin, but instead desires to obey his word. He will also grant you Eternal life in his presence; The greatest pleasure on earth doesn\u2019t even come close to what God is preparing for believers in the afterlife. <br><br>You\u2019ve been informed; Now the choice is yours. What you do with this information will determine where you spend ETERNITY, meaning, this is the single most critical decision you will EVER make; And all of us here, whether believer or atheist, know deep down that every last word here is true.<br><br>Jesus Christ awaits YOU this very moment.

Nice Video. I didn&#39;t know Prof. Steven Strogatz and I was really well impressed by him.

It&#39;s also interesting to see how the quality developed over the years, congratulations.<br>A thought about this video though: to me, this tendency of synchronization of elements in a connected system doesn&#39;t seem that surprising, from a point of view of minimization of energy principle, so it felt a bit sensationalism (maybe a strong word for this, sorry) to sell it the way you did.<br><br>I know you have to reach different types of audiences, and you have to keep that dopamine of the viewer pumping during the video (especially in the first couple of minutes to lock their attention) but I would&#39;ve sold it differently (I&#39;m not trying to school you - it&#39;s merely personal opinion). I&#39;m not sure if it&#39;s useful to bring up the second law of thermodynamics as a tendency for chaos opposed to the synchronization of some systems - maybe it was not your intention, but it tends to suggest that these systems are special and they can bend this law, or that there is a direct link between these two things. I thought it was confusing or unnecessary, except Prof. Steven Strogatz mentions it regarding the chemical reaction (but maybe it does makes sense and I am missing the point). I would&#39;ve started by simply stating that we observe this, and that had to mean that there is some sort of interaction - so let&#39;s try to understand what mechanisms are behind this and if we can model it (as I write this, I realize I would not be a good show man). <br><br>On another note: I like the detail of the adding the sound to moons periodicity.

That is:<br>We, people that like to attend &quot;classical&quot; music concerts, have learned that when the concert has come to an end and the main performers go in and out from backstage for 2 or 3 times to bow and thank, then you can start to clap about 2 beats per second in order to ask for a reprise (because you are so fond of the performance that want more and it&#39;s also a way of telling the performers that they were awsome).  It may sound impossible that everybody does this without instruction but  it&#39;s not. Everybody gets it by intuition.  It&#39;s like clapping in the same rythm as walking at a normal speed. So everybody is very used to it.  <br>As an example, let&#39;s say the performers come out from backstage for the 3rd time, everyone that liked the performance a lot and want a reprise, clap louder as the performers had the gentleness to come again out of backstage and shortly after they start clapping around 2 beats per second. As you are not synchronized with everybody right away you try consciously to get synchronized with others by trying to clap at the beat of those claps that are already synchronized and therefore sound louder.  Hence, how do the first bunch of synchronized claps happen?  Normally people next to the stage that start clapping with that rythm try to get consciously synchronized and people surrounding follow making an expansion effect very fast as everybody tries consciously to be in the synchronized beat in order to let the performers know your intention. It can also happen that it comes from the back of the audience and people at the front then follow.<br>You can check this in all kind of classical videos and opera videos or attending a &quot;classical&quot; music performance.<br>On the contrary, this does not happen in pop music performances because when you want a reprise the tradition is to whistle, clap endlessly, shout loud,  or simply shout &quot;we want more!!&quot; and again, trying consciously that your &quot;one more song&quot; shout gets synchronized with others or with the already synchronized shout coming from somewhere else in the audience. <br><br>Anyway, great video again from you guys!

(In the case of a TV, the oscillator frequency was in the MHz range, and the signal was injected for a period of about 10 cycles, about 16000 times a second; so even if synchronization took a few thousand injections, it was practically instantaneous as far as the viewer was concerned.)

It is the problem of corrugations forming on dirt roads and even on bitumen roads. I have experienced this on the Bruce Highway in Australia at Raglan. How is it that vehicles with different suspension characteristics can form regular corrugations which for several kilometres can have a constant wavelength?<br>Several years ago while tutoring an engineering student who was studying railways I learnt that the problem of corrugation occurs on rail lines as well. I was astonished. These rail lines carried coal trains mainly , the wagons of which are all very similar in characteristics.<br>It seems to me that the metronomes synchronise because they are physically connected at the same time. Is it possible that oscillators, such as vehicle suspensions, which are all different but pass over the road or rail at different times can become synchronised by passing over the road or rail sequentially in time? A new road or rail is dead flat, let&#39;s assume. Then, just as the metronomes synchronise in phase with the majority of the metronomes at the start, the wavelength in the road or rail is that of the most common wavelength of the initial vehicles and this is gradually impressed upon the road or rail.<br>I happily confess that my knowledge of this cyclic behaviour is limited.

I was in sturdy hiking bootsd and maybe 10kg in my backpack. I&#39;m not a runner, but I followed them for an hour on the goat trails either side of the main trail, jumping from rock to rock when the soil gave way to trickier ground, and following in their footsteps. Sometimes the lead would drop to the back and I&#39;d be second to last. I have previously described it as their energy affecting me - slipstreaming, in a way.

Leonard Susskind is doing research into how black holes exhibit complex systems phenomena, and he devised a way to talk about it that generalizes complexity theory as a whole...that systems can be described as moving from one state to another, and that the the transition from one state of a system to another state of a system is based on the minimum number of computations it takes to get from one to the other. He found that black holes reach thermal equilibrium orders upon orders upon orders of magnitude sooner then reaching Maximal complexity, when the system has cycled through all possible states, or rather cycles through the all computations.<br><br>So...what does the above mean? It means that Equilibirum...or complete homogeneity is not the final death state of a system....The maximal complexity is, which is the final state at which the exploration of all the different states of the system have been computated...This means that just like this synchronous behavior in the fluid, there can be, and in fact could be billions upon billions of oscillations of a black hole at thermal equilibrium to exit equilibrium into some heterogenous state, and return again... each time experiencing some other computational path as the system as a whole moves toward maximal complexity.<br><br>So what is the implication of that? If the universe is headed toward Heat Death...Entropy Death...then if the above is the case then simply put, entropy death isn&#39;t the final state of the universe...the maximal complexity of it would be...and that means we would experience, or have already experienced, every possible iteration and every possible computation of the universe there could ever be...it just takes zillions of years each time. What&#39;s that mean for life after death? This means that you live this exact same life a near infinite number of times, it just takes that much time for you to experience it again...and you&#39;ve also experienced everyone else lives a zillion times...it just takes zillions of years.  And consciousness? If you experience everyone&#39;s life over and over and your own over and over, each time slightly different or even the same...then what is conscious really but a concentrated perspective of an overall macroscale perspective that you experience eventually in a zillion years? <br><br>The implications for Susskind&#39;s theory are grave and interesting enough to make a video on.

This is a Universal Principle that should work at Quantum and Celestial level. You may be able to understand it with a fact if you are able to look into the relationship of Physics and Information. Specially with a fact that Material in Nature can only be accessed by access of information of the Material, this principle or fundamental is used by the nature itself.  Matter by nature will always store information else it will be inacceable and information follow all rules of Physics when stored on Material but when information is outside the Material only in realm of information thats when it has its own behaviour and the meta data in the realm of information is very much different from what meta data is when the information is on matter.", "comment_date": "2021-03-31T21:19:09Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Jorge Gonzalez", "comment_text": "What about turn signals.

A lot of true facts - but - totally wrong about the people side sway source and its meaning. Would take me pages to relate, but the way we walk  (people upright) is TIGHTLY related to conservation of energy. Human walking is insanely energy efficient ... at the speed which is dictated by the double pendulum legs swinging and the transfer of swing leg energy (deceleration must be prior to full swing) to the body (c of g) travel over the opposite side stance leg (vertical pendulum - Joe Pallooka punching bag). The two KINDS of pendulums MUST be in sync or else energy is LOST (debilitating and a major source of disability - usually unrecognized). So c of G does NOT lateralize over the stance leg (foot) but flies BETWEEN the width of the footsteps. UNLESS =&gt;SLOWED&lt;=. <br><br>With SLOWING, the flyby does not work and c of G requires wider flight curve to the support side (away from swing side). AVERAGE stride time (not related to the process but to the average SIZE &amp; weight distribution of the people doing it - so it can vary) is 1.2 seconds.  People leaving a movie (slowed by those ahead &amp; limited narrow exit to # going through) spill a lot of popcorn as they get side bumped by slow walk side sway. Also tight (front to back) approximation has right foot end swing landing on person in front&#39;s Achilles tendon (OUCH!!!) just as that was about to swing. That too synchronizes steps in a cue. <br><br>Maintaining the pendulum is biologic goal #1. Using smaller arc of the pendulum is OK as long as the moving parts are still pendulum in type.

As always, this opened up a lot on this concept of synchronization. The thing I like about your videos is that it not only helps me understand the concepts, it triggers some chain of thoughts. <br>The point that caught my attention is that this synchronization transcends different fields from physics to mechanics as Prof Steven puts it (at <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-_VPRCtiUg&amp;t=10m10s\">10:10</a>). Even the psychology of people or the behaviour of other beings. For every great technology/theory that came along, there has been some form of negative/destructive usage, thankfully the benefits outweighed the dangers (in most cases, I believe). In this case, too, it may be possible but for the part of beneficial uses of this theory, I am wondering, if this can be used to control earthquakes, tsunamis or such &quot;vibration&quot; related forces of nature? If somehow we are able to control the &quot;synchronization&quot;, can this be used as an infinite energy source by harvesting all those &quot;vibrations&quot; in nature? And at the people behaviour level, can this somehow be used to control the &quot;mob&quot; behaviour in people like when people are able to sync themselves up (similar to the audience in Budapest)? But then how do we control/stimulate/trigger the synchronization in nature? May be some meaningless thinking. :-)", "comment_date": "2021-03-31T15:21:15Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Ranjith Srk", "comment_text": "Thank for bringing such insightful videos, not to undermine your work but i feel you are filling the void left by Vsause(Micheal).
