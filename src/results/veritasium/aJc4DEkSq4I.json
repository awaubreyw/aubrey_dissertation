It is quite obvious that the net moments about the c.g. of an object is zero if it is in equilibrium. Nonetheless, in this case, by drawing the combined reaction force from the ground acting on a person such that its line of action coincides with its weight, the principle of conservation of moments applies. A little cautiousness goes a long way, especially in education.", "comment_date": "2012-01-30T13:17:57Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "BrizzyBeast", "comment_text": "2:06 LOL c;", "comment_date": "2012-01-29T18:17:14Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Veritasium", "comment_text": "@MrLatrommi Most introductory physics courses draw all forces acting through the centre of mass because this avoids complexities due to rotational motion.", "comment_date": "2012-01-29T06:29:54Z", "likes_count": 3}, {"comment_by": "Senex Ludum", "comment_text": "Good video.

The answer is Newton&#39;s Third Law is never violated. If you are standing still the normal force must be equal to your weight. If a table breaks beneath you, then the normal force is less than weight and you accelerate to the Earth. This doesn&#39;t violate Newton&#39;s third law because the equal and opposite reaction force is actually the force with which you attract the earth.
