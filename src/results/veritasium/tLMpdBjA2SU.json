He decided to lecture about gyroscopes, a subject in which he had only recently become interested. His interest had been aroused by an amateur inventor named Alex Jones, who contacted Laithwaite about a reactionless propulsion drive he (Jones) had invented.<br><br>After seeing a demonstration of Jones&#39;s small prototype (a small wagon with a swinging pendulum which advanced intermittently along a table top), Laithwaite became convinced that &quot;he had seen something impossible&quot;. In his lecture before the Royal Institution he claimed that gyroscopes weigh less when spinning and, to demonstrate this, he showed that he could lift a spinning gyroscope mounted on the end of a rod easily with one hand but could not do so when the gyroscope was not spinning. This was discussed in the BBC science series &#39;Horizon - 2015-2016: 2. Project Greenglow - The Quest for Gravity Control&#39;.<br><br>In his 1974 lectures, Laithwaite suggested that Newton&#39;s laws of motion could not account for the behaviour of gyroscopes and Laithwaite suggested that they could be used as a means of reactionless propulsion. The members of the Royal Institution rejected his ideas and his lectures were not published at the time, a first for the Royal Institution. His lectures were subsequently published independently as Engineer Through The Looking-Glass and also on the Royal Institution website.<br><br>Despite this rejection and the fact that Laithwaite later acknowledged that gyroscopes behave fully in accord with Newtonian mechanics, he continued to explore gyroscopic behaviour, maintaining the belief that some form of reactionless propulsion could be derived from them. Laithwaite set up Gyron Ltd with William Dawson and, in 1993, applied for a patent entitled &quot;Propulsion System&quot;. A United States Patent, Number 5860317, was granted in 1999.

But actually, I think it literally does weigh less as you twirl the apparatus above your head.  That first second or so as you start the rotation, there is a small downward force (which I think accounts for the little blip on the scale at <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLMpdBjA2SU&amp;t=0m28s\">0:28</a>) but as it spirals up it is losing angular momentum causing a small force in the opposite direction, making it feel slightly lighter.  You&#39;ll note that if there were no affect the scale should actually register more weight as you push and accelerate something heavy upward over your head.  The scale does not show this (unless that is the blip at <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLMpdBjA2SU&amp;t=0m28s\">0:28</a>, but I doubt it as I don&#39;t think you start to actually lift it until after) making me think it must effectively be a tiny bit lighter.<br><br>The scale with the little gyro shows no change because the gyro is on a balance with a weight and can teeter-totter but the gyro clearly does want to move up and down as you nudge the angular speed of the base (like at <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLMpdBjA2SU&amp;t=3m39s\">3:39</a>).  So, if it were not allowed to teeter-totter (locked in the Z axis) I claim the scale <b>would</b> show a change as the rotation rate is nudged one way or the other.  So Derek, my guess is that when you first start to whirl the big heavy spinny thing (my technical term), there was a small extra downward force felt in your left hand which was then reversed as as the spiral slowed as it lifted.

When he holds his hand at the base of the shaft right next to the wheel it&#39;s little to no torque. So he&#39;d be applying 42 pounds of force to lift the object. Then when it&#39;s spinning, he easily lifts it. like it&#39;s not even close to 42 pounds. I understand that the spinning causes the object to want to maintain its horizontal orientation, thus negating the guy&#39;s need to apply a torque to keep it upright. That is what allows him to hold it at the end of the shaft. which would be impossible for any human being to do. But, shouldn&#39;t he still struggle to lift it? he should lift it as if he were lifting it at the base. which was very difficult for him. I think the answer lies with the fact that he threw the device forward and it lifted itself up. But if that&#39;s the case, the scale should decrease at that point. Which would make sense to me.

I am to write is meant for others to think about and if they have the time and equipment, they can try and confirm it.I did it in my simple manner of home experimentations.<br>1. Keeping the spinning plane. The mass in the spinning wheel of a gyro acts in the plane of rotation and tries to keep it due to the high angular momentum.<br>2. Precession at 90 degrees. The plane of the spinning wheel may be looked upon being a lot of individual elemental masses placed on flexible radial spokes and each elemental mass can be treated individually.  When the wheel is fast spinning on its axis all the radial masses are spinning with a  high circumferential velocity/momentum depending on the radius and the spin rate. If at any moment, the spinning axis of the gyro wheel is tilted, then some mass at the end of the tilting radius will try and move out of the spinning plane while another on the opposite radius will move out of the spinning plane in the opposite direction on a diameter. So having an additional force/torque applied to them the elemental masses will accelerate out of the original spinning plane. As these elemental masses are tied with a constant radius with the axle, then while the tilt of the axis causes the particle to accelerate out of the relative halves of the wheel,  their final &quot; integrated circular motion&quot; will be a maximum when the mass particles are in quadrature or 90 degrees to that location where they began to accelerate out of the original plane. Eventually when the tilt of the axis is long enough then all the mass particles on the spinning wheel will take up spinning in another plane at a 90-degree angle with the tilt that accelerated them out of the original plane. That is a 90-degree precession effect.<br>3. Precession and holding of a gyro on an extended shaft. If a spinning wheel is placed at the end of a long extended shaft where the free end is placed on a vertical stationary mast, and the spinning wheel at a radius R from the support mast, then as the wheel drops vertically,  it tries to do this with the acceleration of 32 ft/sec^2 of gravity, which is relatively slow with respect to the velocity of the spinning mass particles. With the vertical drop, hence the tilting of the axle, the mass particles on the upper half of the spinning wheel will be &quot;accelerated out&quot; away from the central supporting mast and those in the lower half will be &quot;accelerated in&quot;  towards the support mast. This acceleration one way and the other on the upper and lower half of the spinning wheel will cause the integrated acceleration to change the plane of spinning at 90 degrees to the initial vertical drop, horizontally.  The spinning wheel changes its plane at a right angle to the vertical dropping, hence tilting axle.  It is important to realize that the particles that accelerate out or in towards the central support mast are spinning much faster than the spinning wheel, as one whole unit, can drop due to slow gravity effects, so  the top and bottom masses in the plane of spin, will try and replace each other so fast that they cause a high inertia fluctuation, similar as a big capacitor in a low pass filter objects to an AC fluctuation or &quot;stationary mass inertia&quot; be it electrical or statically and dynamically mechanically. This 90 egress action will try and fling the pivot support point on the central stationary mast in a horizontal direction, but it cannot as the mast is stationary, so the horizontal reaction must bring about  the result as the free rotation of the whole spinning wheel about the stationary support mast. So &quot;a tiny vertical drop&quot; tried to precess the wheel in &quot;a horizontal motion&quot; at a related natural rate of change.<br>4. Precessed rising of the gyro. If the natural rate of change of the horizontal motion is hurried up ( or slowed) then a second precession process will take place and the reaction to it will be a 90-degree reaction where the spinning gyro will now lift, ( or drop) gaining (or losing) potential energy from the eternal input.  If for any reason the whole spinning wheel is dropped vertically in a sudden action, then the gyro wheel will wobble along changing KE into a faster horizontal precession which in turn will raise the gyro and this transferred oscillation will proceed till it stabilizes, as it is damped down. There is another interesting reason why the spinning wheel of a gyro when on an extended axle on a central stationary mast may lift up to the vertical till its axle is perfectly vertical. <br>5. Rising (or dropping) of a gyro while precessing around central stationery must. When the fast-spinning wheel of a gyro spins and at the same time rotates /wobbles around a central stationary mast, and is SPUN AND TRANSLATED, then this spinning and translating effect will result in the spinning stationary circle, being modified into a type of cycloidal motion and what is more, the cycloidal motion of the particles on the spinning wheel will vary as the spinning wheel is tilted and then it rises and drops below the horizontal spinning axis.  Any cycloidal trajectory, unlike a perfect circle, it will have a variation in velocity and in acceleration and hence the related generated forces with the varying acceleration as a particle moves along the cycloidal trajectory.  If the extended axle of the gyro is about 45  degrees tilt, then the conical cycloidal trajectory of the spinning and precession wheel around the central support mast, the differential accelerations, hence the accompanying differential forces will &quot;  throw up&quot; the whole gyro to lift it to try and reach the vertical position ( or the inverted vertical position). Here all the mass particles will be moving in a horizontal circle with constant velocities and constant accelerations and hence stable. In practical experiments, this vertical stable position ( as a spinning top) will be held till the gyro slowing down and the weight due to gravity will take over.  It seems that all the internal cycloidal forces on the spinning particles of the gyro wheel are RADIAL to the center of the spinning wheel and hence these cycloidal acceleration forces will not precess the gyro hence the &quot; throw up&quot; and rising of the gyro dictated by the cycloidal differential accelerations. <br>6. Centrifugal force. If one looks into the differential accelerations that exist withing the tilted, conical, cycloidal trajectory of the mass particles in a spinning gyro and translating wheel, one will notice that the accelerating components of the tilted acceleration vector of the elemental particles do oppose the centrifugal force.  Many people declare ( and they are correct) that the centrifugal force in a spinning and precessing gyro &quot; vanishes&quot; and the solution is found in the differential vectorial accelerations contained in the cycloidal trajectory of spinning and translating circulating surface of a conical, tilted, translating and spinning of a balanced wheel. If one looks at the PLAN view of the cycloidal path traveled by each mass particle in spinning and processing gyro one will see CONVEX AND CONCAVE curves traversed by particles navigating the upper-lower halves of the spinning wheel curves with respect to the central pivot and this means that there are TWO CENTRIFUGAL FORCES  one acting inward ( on the upper one) and one acting outwards ( on the lower half.  The centrifugal force acting inwards has a higher magnitude than the centrifugal force acting outwards. This is due to the fact that the cycloid has a distorted elliptical plan view were the convex and concave curves have a different radius of curvature which the mass particle traverse to generate the inbound and the outbound centrifugal forces acting at different heights to balance out the gravitational torque and the outwards centrifugal force on a floating gyro.   There are other dynamics unbalances in a &quot; statically and dynamically balanced wheel&quot; <br>7. When the external torque on a gyro is removed suddenly, the wheel shows no inertia effect as it is not the whole mass of the wheel that is being translated, but effectively it is the elemental particles that are being displaced out of the spinning plane and hence effectively little inertia is shown when the outside force is reduced unless the whole spinning gyro is shot out and thrown off the muzzle of a gun, where all the mass is being translated. <br>8. The gyro cannot ever produce any action without any reaction and if one tries to propel a spacecraft with it,   and try to spin the wheel in space to get it going, the spacecraft will spin back. If one seeks reactionless actions..........they must look elsewhere but not inside the gyro.  <br>9, Finally here is the equation of a flat gyro operating on a rotating arm to check and approximate to the differential accelerations of the family of complex three-dimensional conical cycloids.  I obtained and plotted these differences in accelerations as the cycloidal trajectory is followed and the difference of accelerations on the upper half and lower half of a spinning gyro. It is all very clear, hence the tiny differential repetitive forces give the gyro its elegance and unintuitive perplexing behavior. <br>10.  Location of particle = R1. e^jw1.t  + R2.e^jw2,t<br>         velocity of particle = R1. jw1.e^jw1.t  + R2.jw2. e^jw2,t<br>   acceleration of particle=R1.

Normally (without the gyro) only vertical movement needs to be considered, but with the gyro horizontal movement is translated by the gyro into a vertical force, so horizontal movement can add to the muscular distance providing the pulley-like advantage. Bringing horizontal movement into play also allows the use of the strong muscles of the core and legs.<br><br><br>Edit: I went and learned a little about angular momentum. What I called a vertical force from the gyro is actually a change in the angular momentum which tends to rotate the gyro upward about the axis formed by his hand on the bar.

But just as importantly, Derek is standing on the ground.  Keep that fact in mind.  <br><br>As he goes to lift the spinning flywheel (always in the direction that it wants to precess), the rotating mass of the flywheel starts to resist being turned at an angle to its axis; this is the &quot;conservation of angular momentum&quot;, and it&#39;s why a gyroscope resists tilting.  It <b>really</b> doesn&#39;t want to leave that axis!  But Derek is <b>forcing</b> it to tilt, and it&#39;s not happy about that, so it starts pushing back, in the form of transferring some of that energy of the rotating mass, through the handle, into <b>him</b> , in the form of torque.  Now, bearing in mind that Derek&#39;s weight is 3.5 times the weight of the flywheel and handle, he&#39;s already pretty well set-up to counteract that torque.  And so long as he&#39;s gripping the handle firmly (which is easy to do), his arm doesn&#39;t have to do much work; all it has to do is to provide an unyielding connection between the handle and the ground, through his body.  <br><br>As he turns while holding the handle, the angular momentum is transferred into the handle in the form of torque, and thereby into his hand.  His hand doesn&#39;t let the shaft turn, so the momentum keeps getting transferred further and further -- through his arm, his torso, his legs, his feet, and finally to the ground.  All of those together easily counteract the flywheel&#39;s &quot;objection&quot; to having its angular momentum changed.  As long as he keeps turning, the flywheel will keep trying to precess, and trying to remain in the same plane, but he&#39;s not letting it do the latter, so that energy is transferred in the form of torque which, when meeting with the resistance of his hand and the mass of his body, and the unyielding ground, takes the flywheel in the only direction left to go: up, until it can return to being in the same plane it wanted to remain in, in the first place.<br><br>I hope this helps.

The faster the wheel spins, the greater are the reaction forces and thus the more you will observe precession. The reason for the reaction forces are the torque due to your hand holding the wheel and a rotation of the wheel not parallel to a principal axis right after release (addition of angular velocities). One can derive these forces by Euler&#39;s equations.

YOU DID NOT DO THAT!\r<br> \r<br>\r<br>What Professor Eric Laithwaite  did say was that the precessing spinning wheel demonstrated ZERO angular momentum and, (by definition),  ZERO CentrIpetal force. (Reaction Force of Centripetal = Centrifugal). See video at 46 mins 24 secs. and 46 min 02 secs.\r<br>\r<br>I notice that neither you nor your Australian E.

The system being the flywheel, the man, potential energy, kinetic energy and the ground. His arm does less work in raising the gyroscope, but he does more work in rotating himself, effectively increasing the rate of precession, and transferring energy to and from the flywheel. His total energy expenditure, plus the energies transferring to and from the flywheel rotation, are exactly the same as the energy used in simply lifting a stationary mass of 19 kg, but <i>different muscles are being used</i> to accomplish the task. <br><br>As he rotates himself faster, lifting the flywheel, the <i>total</i> rotational speed of the flywheel increases by an amount equal to his rotation about the vertical axis plus the rotational speed of the flywheel. <br><br>(Edit: To explain the next sentences, in a frictionless system, the flywheel would gain rotational speed in proportion to the man&#39;s rotational speed - every turn he makes is one extra turn to the flywheel, and as he slows down, the flywheel slows down by that much. In practice, the flywheel slows all of the time, because of friction but less so as he turns himself faster.) <br><br>Energy is thus transferred via his work in rotating himself plus the gyroscope. When he lowers the gyroscope, his rotational speed reduces, as does the speed of rotation of the flywheel. Energy is being transferred back from the flywheel. The residual precession, as he holds the gyroscope horizontally, represents the losses through friction, as the flywheel slows down. That&#39;s why a fixed gyroscope will gradually lower its shaft&#39;s free end to horizontal and below, until it strikes an object, and then transfers its remaining rotational energy to the obstruction, through noise, heat, and the disturbance of the momentum of the object. It sometimes runs away across a surface, or even shatters itself, whilst giving up that energy. <br><br>The two measured weight displacements on the scale are the peak points during which energies are being transferred. It can be seen from the graph that the increase in measured weight x the area under the curve and the &#39;neutral point is approximately equal and opposite to the area above the curve x the measured weight. (The discrepancy is mainly due to the man working to adapt to the changing forces between his arms and the gyroscope, and to friction.) Thus no net &#39;lifting force&#39; results, and the laws momentum / thermodynamics are satisfied. In fact, if anything, the larger increase in measured weight than the measured decrease, proves that, if anything, energy is lost, and no net &#39;lift&#39; has occurred.<br><br>Unfortunately, Professor Laithwaite had misunderstood what he was saying. Sadly, he lost his job, after losing credibility because of that error and he died with a somewhat unbalanced mind, in many peoples&#39; estimation. In other respects, the Professor was a brilliant man, and people tend to forget that fact, because mistakes are much easier to sensationalise.", "comment_date": "2019-01-18T03:48:15Z", "likes_count": 16}, {"comment_by": "Alfonce Brown", "comment_text": "Alien technology", "comment_date": "2019-01-14T03:27:34Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "\u0e2d\u0e23\u0e31\u0e0d \u0e17\u0e34\u0e49\u0e07\u0e42\u0e04\u0e15\u0e23", "comment_text": "It is their nature.

This can be simply explained by trying to find the centre of mass of you and the wheel combined before and after lifting it above your head. Since the position of centre of mass has increased there definitely will be extra force downwards and the faster you lift it, greater will be it&#39;s magnitude. Similarly If you put it down there will be a decrease in downward force so it will show your weight lower than the actual weight 91kgs. But once you keep it at a constant height you&#39;ll see 91kgs. If you observe clearly the pointer was actually swinging above 92 while he&#39;s lifting and below 92 when he&#39;s put that down. The narrator wrongly claimed it has swung about 91 both sides equally. And also if you notice, the pointer swung more rapidly while he was bringing it down than it did while lifting it up.

Why the spinning wheel feels lighter? This is not because you need only provide the support force which equals to the weight of the wheel, if this was true, you could lift up the wheel with one hand easily without spinning. The important phenomenon here is when the wheel gets spinning, you also need to move around when you try to lift it. That&#39;s the core of precession.  &quot;If the speed of the rotation and the magnitude of the external torque are constant, the spin axis will move at right angles to the direction that would intuitively result from the external torque.&quot; (From Wikipedia) This means some of the weight of the spinning wheel is supported by the angular momentum of your moving around. Then lets explain why the total weight (including the wheel and person) didn&#39;t change.

Near the end you said that the reason the spinning wheel feels lighter when being lifted is that you don&#39;t have to counter-balance the torque. However, if this were the correct explanation, then you would expect a 40lb dumbbell (ie 20lbs on each side of the hand) to be as easy to lift as the spinning flywheel, since there would be no torque to counter-balance there either. I suspect this wouldn&#39;t be the case, particularly given how hard it was for you to lift the non-spinning wheel when your hand was right next to the wheel. Spinning or not, for the 40lb wheel to rise there must be a greater than 40lb upward force applied to it. For the non-spinning wheel, that force obviously all has to come from your upward-pushing muscles. For the spinning wheel, isn&#39;t part of that force coming from your initial lateral rotational push (plus gyroscopic action)? That is, the force required for the upward acceleration is shared in that case by a larger group of muscles. Since your upward-pushing muscles don&#39;t have to supply all the force for the lift, you perceive the wheel as being lighter.

Then when it&#39;s spinning, he easily lifts it. like it&#39;s not even close to 42 pounds. I understand that the spinning causes the object to want to maintain its horizontal orientation, thus negating the guy&#39;s need to apply a torque to keep it upright. That is what allows him to hold it at the end of the shaft. which would be impossible for any human being to do. But, shouldn&#39;t he still struggle to lift it? he should lift it as if he were lifting it at the base. which was very difficult for him.

But this is erroneous. Can we create artificial gravity in space ? Yes ! By spinning the spacecraft. However, by doing so, we are creating anti-gravity, or rotational force. Positive gravity attracts the mass to a central singularity. Anti-gravity repels from a central singularity. Technically, if gravitational force is linear, then anti-gravity must be the opposite of linear, what we understand as spin. We can see that clearly demonstrated in the dynamics of our solar system. If the earth spun faster round the sun, it would break away from its current orbit, in which it is restrained by the suns gravity. So we can deduce that spin force will overcome gravitational force, if equilibrium is exceeded. So what happens if the rotational force demonstrated in a gyroscope, exceeds the gravitational force acting on it ? Here is another clue, involving the gyroscopic effect. A helicopter does not create enough downward thrust to lift it off the ground alone. If you want to see how much downward thrust it takes to lift an object vertically, watch a Saturn 5 take off.

You don&#39;t really need to know anything about that. Think of the wheel as an equatorial orbit around the Earth. Pretend you&#39;re looking at the orbit straight on so it looks like a rocket on a line. If you wanted to go north, then you&#39;d probably burn north and the line will translate upwards with your rocket. But this isn&#39;t the case because you&#39;re in an orbit and basically &quot;spinning&quot; in a circle. So instead of the line following the rocket up, the line and rocket keep their position, but the end of the line in which the rocket is orbiting to will rotate upwards. So you&#39;re basically changing the path to where the rocket will eventually end up 90 degrees in front of it&#39;s current position in the orbit.<br><br>So how does this apply to the wheel? Well if you think about it, gyroscopic precession is simply a redirection of an applied force to 90 degrees forward in the rotation of the wheel. So in this video, the spinning wheel is trying to be rotated by gravity so that the side facing away from the shaft will be towards the ground. But because the wheel is spinning, it redirects the force of gravity on the wheel 90 degrees out of phase so that it rotates it from left to right instead of up and down. We can also tell that the wheel is spinning clockwise due to the direction it precesses, as the force is is rotated 90 degrees in front in the direction of rotation.<br><br>Okay, but how does this apply to the wheel going up and down if you speed up or slow down the precession? Well, the same principal still applies, you apply a force to try to change its rotation from left to right, and so due to the principal, it will be redirected so it&#39;s rotating up and down instead!<br><br>Anyways, this was too long of an explanation, but I hope it helped!", "comment_date": "2016-01-09T06:34:15Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "shubham kumar", "comment_text": "anyone can help me with my two confusions?<br><a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLMpdBjA2SU&amp;t=2m34s\">2:34</a> higher the precession,and it rises.WHY DOES IT RISE?<br><a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLMpdBjA2SU&amp;t=0m50s\">0:50</a> I THINK HE DIDN&#39;T EXPLAIN WHY THE WEIGHT FLUCTUATES", "comment_date": "2016-01-09T06:28:52Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "higbort", "comment_text": "couldn&#39;t you make your muscles huge, with no work with this idea?", "comment_date": "2016-01-08T22:19:17Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "KarlitosDoritos", "comment_text": "Technically it should be heavier because of m=e/c (squared) from the energy.", "comment_date": "2016-01-08T19:47:40Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Just The Highlights", "comment_text": "This is mind boggling.

So you are not only having to support the weight of the whole assembly, but also provide the considerable effort required to resist it from wanting to drop the heavy end to the ground. Then once rotating, the flywheel&#39;s natural precession (mostly) relieves you of the additional effort of providing a stationary fulcrum, as long as you move with it and not against. A spinning mass acting as a flywheel imparts a directional force when perturbed, but the mass is not in any way unbound from gravity, as it is not producing anything other than reactive force to input. An interesting twist (heh) on this demonstration would be to have the lifter stand on a platform with bearings (like a lazy susan) so that their body could easily rotate without moving their feet, to show what would happen if attempts are made to stay facing the same direction while lifting, or holding it stationary, etc. I&#39;m guessing in the instance of lifting, the torque would transfer to rotating the lifter&#39;s body, and cancel out some (or all?) of the effort to lift it easily?

However, if I start to turn in a circle while supporting the axle on one end, the wheel sharply angles up.  It tilts, so that the end of the axle opposite from me goes upward.

Anything will not fall without gravity. Spinning things also fall. When a thing with axial stick spin, its collected rotation power send force to not only air around it; sending air contacting it to different directions.  It sends air up, down, left, right, and... It also send force to the axial stick. The portion of mass on the spinning downward side pulls down sending force on the axial rigid solid stick in the line to one&#39;s hand(s); but the opposite portion pulls up. Like when one swing a ball with rope, when the ball going down it pulls one&#39;s hand down; and when the ball going up it really has force on one&#39;s hand (the force pulling the hand upward). It should be because of rigidity of the stick makes the weight of the spinning wheel moving from its center to the hand(s).  It should be a bit shaking holding the axial stick; but the opposite forces happen in the same time with very high frequency, so that, it must be hard to feel.    When the spinning is very powerful, the pulling forces would be very strong, much stronger than gravity force like elephant and ant. So that, the feeling of the gravity doing something at the wheel point is like zero. Maybe, gravity force was also combined with the spinning force and make the feeling of the wheel weight at the hand point. The weight total is still the same, but the feeling of law of the lever is almost disappear. For the precession, I think the spinning switch gravity&#39;s effect from pulling the wheel down to pushing the wheel to the direction that the bottom portion of the wheel&#39;s mass going to. Gravity force that pulls one side (right side; if spin right side down) down making the rotation force of the mass portion increase. Rotation power(increased) on the bottom of the wheel pushes the wheel precession moonwalking around the center. Rotation power which still increased on the left side pull the wheel up. Rotation power going down because of gravity effect on the left side(going up). This thinking, however, is weird because of thinking both sides separately to portions while they are connected to the other side rigidly. When the mass portion is near the top position of the wheel, rotation power which going down sends lower force pulling wheel to the opposite side of the precession. So the wheel when not standing upright, will make precession. If still using portion thinking for the other precession phenomenon (pushing faster in the same direction of precession and the wheel lift up), it might make sense. That because one increases force and speed to the direction, which makes the rotation force of the bottom and left (mass portion that going up) increased. So the wheel lift up. Are those make sense?

The statement is:<br><br>&quot;You only need to create an upward force equal to the wheel&#39;s weight&quot;, but that is not true. The upward force is much LESS than the wheel&#39;s weight, for, even when the wheel is held in the hand (not by the shaft), it is still heavier than when it is in gyroscopic procession.\u00a0 The procession, itself, causes the wheel to have less &quot;weight&quot; relative to the hand that is holding it up.<br><br>The reason why a person is able to &quot;lift&quot; it (create additional force beyond the weight which is already factored into the total weight of the man and wheel according to the scale), is because it does not require a reverse (downward) force, which is why additional weight is not seen on the scale when he pulls it up. Normally, the scale would temporarily increase in weight as he pushed the weight up.<br><br>The reason for this effect is that the upward lift is derived from the spinning of the wheel. The wheel, infact, decreases in rotational speed on the shaft as it is elevated. Think of it as being similar to spinning a wheel up really fast, and then letting it go, traveling up a hill. As the wheel travels up the hill...the wheel will slow down, not just horizontally, but also rotationally, until it stops. If it is not braked at the top, it will descend downwards and regain its rotational speed once again as it accelerates back to the bottom of the hill. This whole process is identical to the gyroscopic effect, except it has no linear horizontal movement, and only a circular procession.<br><br>So, since all the lift is derived from the wheel itself slowing down as he lifts....the scale will not see a change in the weight from him lifting it up. And when he lowers it back down again, the rotational speed of the wheel on the shaft will once again increase.<br><br>Please note, when I speak of &quot;rotational speed&quot;, I am not referring to the perimeter that the weight is traveling around his body in a circular fashion. I am referring, instead, to the actual spinning it is doing <b>on the shaft.</b><br><br>The torque is <b>not</b> what makes it easily lifted above the head. The torque <b>does contribute its portion</b>, but it does not explain the rest of the portion. For, even without the torque, he still had an easier time raising the weight above his head than when it is not spinning, and being lifted above the head by the gripping of the wheel itself (and not the shaft). In essence, the torque is eliminated, but the weight is still heavy, and yet lifts more easily than without the spinning, while holding it at the wheel where no torque is needed.  So yes...<b>it, the upward force required to lift the weight, is still smaller than the amount needed if it were not spinning.</b><br><br>Its all because of the draw from the spinning of the wheel on the shaft.

(at least I assume it wants to orbit and rise in one direction) I think this orbit might be in reaction to gravity, the only force that is significant in this situation besides the spin and momentum. I&#39;d like to see him try to rotate this thing around himself in the opposite direction.<br><br>So what I&#39;m saying is the spinning flywheel is not just an object.

First one: What is a prism?? We learned all about wavelengths and frequencies of electromagnetic radiation in chem class. As the common introduction to that topic we explain the light passing through a prism apparatus, where the light refracts into the colors of the rainbow. But what is a prism and \u00a0why does that happen? Do the photons just bounce around between atoms in such a way that the larger wavelength photons shoot out in a different direction? What is really happening within the Prism, and why does it happen only(except for the slit experiment) in that kind of setup?? it seems to be one of those easily recognizable experiments which very few people truly understand, like Millikan&#39;s oil drops (which i don&#39;t really get either), or Rutherford&#39;s Gold foil and alpha particles, but are all very recognizable and people can say why they&#39;re important.

It&#39;s invariant mass does not change, but this change in inertial mass affects how it behaves in a gravitational-inertial field which I will now try to explain.\u00a0Einstein&#39;s GR supposes a geometry of spacetime which has &quot;curvature&quot; and this idea is rather similar. Please be aware that what follows is not a currently accepted theory in physics, despite consistency with all scientific observations. For now, this &#39;gravitational-inertial field&#39; will simply be referred to as a background.<br><br>In a flat background, inertia &quot;resists&quot; velocity change (and this is how &quot;inertial&quot; motion is commonly defined). On the space station for example, we can see these inertial effects when a body is given motion; resistance to changes in motion happen. This should not be confused with resistance to motion; only resistance to motion &quot;change&quot; needs to be used in all cases (even with objects &#39;at rest&#39;).<br><br>Conversely, it is possible that in a background curved by massive bodies, inertia &quot;induces&quot; velocity change (which is not considered by current definitions for inertia). We find for example, that accelerating in gravitational free-fall, bodies can be inertial and uninfluenced by force despite accelerating.<br><br>Therefore, it is possible that the one background exhibits &quot;resistance&quot; to change, and &quot;induction&quot; of change depending on it&#39;s local shape. It is important to reinforce here that the motion of a body across the cosmos could be inertial, whether it is moving with velocity or change thereof.\u00a0This is how inertia and gravity could be the same mechanism. Imagine the one background which resists motion change for bodies in a flat locality, and induces change for bodies in a curved locality.<br><br>Both shapes of the background (flat or curved) amount to inertial motions when forces are not influencing a body (fictitious or applied). For a curved background to be present and induce motion change for bodies (typically change in velocity), it is because some large mass, like a planet, a star or a black hole curves the local background. So, the proposition is not too dissimilar to GR with regards to curvature. The difference is in the classification of gravity and the distinction to inertia; the two observations may be two behaviors of motion emerging from the same mechanism.<br><br>For things which move against the shape of this background, &quot;fictitious forces&quot; influence the motion. Here&#39;s a good reason why &quot;inertial&quot; as rectilinear and uniform velocity does not follow. A body could be moving upward away from a planet with velocity and by no means be inertial. This issue limits operational definition of &quot;inertial&quot; in SR, and restricts the use of velocity in the Lorentz transformations. In SR it is resolved by the flatness of spacetime. Because spacetime is flat in SR, any acceleration is non-inertial.<br><br>So a &quot;fictitious force&quot; would be an influence on any body that was moving against the shape of the background. With forces influencing motion against the shape of what I will now call an inertial space, we call this a non-inertially moving object or &#39;proper&#39; acceleration. Therefore, an object which moves inertially or non-inertially could be accelerating or in velocity. So it might be an issue to redefine &quot;inertial&quot;. You will notice here I am not talking about frames of reference when I talk about inertial; because right now, I&#39;m describing a possible ontology for gravity and inertia, not a proposed geometry or method for reference.<br><br>With regards to evidence supporting claims, it may be possible that the cause for inertia is the cosmic microwave background. Bicep results demonstrate that ripples (disturbances in the background) have been found pursuant to Einstein&#39;s prediction of GR. It may also be possible that the Higgs mechanism is responsible, or play some role, since this is said to mediate properties of mass through which invariant mass, and inertial mass may find comfortable seating together.", "comment_date": "2014-03-23T08:26:05Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "PINGPONGROCKSBRAH", "comment_text": "Has anyone else ever looked at a digital clock while brushing their teeth with an electric toothbrush and noticed that the segments composing the numbers on the display move relative to one another?

But you are still exerting a force. When the wheel rises above his head there is a (say) ten percent less force to lift it vertically (say 10 lb less). But there is a force at right-angles to the vertical that is 10 lb greater (against) your force input (you have to actually force it (side-ways) to keep your pivot stationary. Your body transforms this extra 10 lb force to the scales (like a bell-crank, from arm to body) to cancel the less down-ward force of the wheel&#39;s weight. So, even if the wheel has less vertical &quot;weight&quot;, the scale still reads the same. With the wheel spinning, some of it&#39;s weight will be converted to a horizontal force that is equal to the &quot;less weight&quot; difference.\u00a0<br>One comment came to mind, and he said that this sort of physics is really involved and there are lot of things going on about this (it&#39;s complex). That said, we are now talking about internal forces and external forces.<br>CLOSED SYSTEM. Basically, an internal force is a body trying to put a force on it&#39;self. It cant. It can only make something move that is part of the body. So a spaceship with no engine power cant make it&#39;self move by using a robot arm (that comes from the same spaceship) putting a force on the same space ship. Nothing will happen, even when a force is applied to the robot arm. That is a closed system, or internal force. But the robot arm can turn a crank or whatever but it won&#39;t propel the space ship.<br>OPEN SYSTEM. This is one body (or bodies) putting a force on another body. This is external force, where the force comes from somewhere else, other than from itself. A rocket engine pushes other bodies away from it, causing a forward force. It&#39;s an external force cos the (other bodies) are moving from the rocket, away from the rocket. As long as the (other bodies) leave the rocket, it&#39;s an external force. And the (other bodies) can&#39;t be re-collected in any way by the rocket, otherwise it would become an internal force (a closed system) and there would be no thrust. This is why perpetual motion doesn&#39;t work. They are all internal force (closed systems).<br>And (unfortunately) the spinning wheel is a closed system and any forces are internal forces. Like the internal force of less weight but more side-ways force, reads the same on the scale. For the scale to change, you need an external force.<br>We tend to marvel at the slightly less weight of the wheel, but tend to ignore the same increase in side-ways force on the wheel.<br>I&#39;m not a scientist, but I played around with this a lot (trying to make a flying saucer).

That would make sense because you would need to put force into the system to increase the potential energy (due to being raised to a higher height) of your shaft-wheel assembly, thus requiring a greater support reaction from the scale. You can see the release of that potential energy at that big dip in weight at the end.
