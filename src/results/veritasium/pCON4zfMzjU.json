UFOs are disc shaped because it&#39;s basically a flying Gravity Generator.

Shifting the Bose-Einstein condensate BEC Superfluid by adjusting the hand interface determines the amount of BEC &quot;Gravity&quot; within the condensed cylindrical containment/disc-housing.

First of all there are two &quot;magnetic poles&quot; induced in copper under each permanent magnet pole whilst they are set in rotational motion: one &quot;supporting&quot; eddy, and another one &quot;resisting&quot; eddy. Both originate from the tendency of metals to not like the change of magnetic fields and induce currents in a way to oppose the change (Lenz&#39;s rule). Those eddies with counter-circulating induced currents try to be symmetrical relative to the centre of the pole but can do so only at very low rotor speeds. Second, induced currents modify the original field (the phenomenon referred to as an &quot;armature reaction&quot;), this causes resulting magnetic field to &quot;lag behind&quot;: permanent magnet pole is ahead, but the net field in copper and on the surface of copper is actually slightly behind of the magnets (you state the opposite). At very high rotational speed the induced eddy-currents are distorted so much, that the &quot;resisting&quot; eddy actually circulates exactly around the corresponding pole, and the &quot;supporting&quot; eddies are pushed into the inter-pole space (where the transverse Holbach-array&#39;s magnet is sitting). And in this situation it is indeed acts as a mirror image of the pole, pretty much shielding the interior of enclosed copper from the magnetic field. Fourth: energy is dissipated due to the fact of finite resistivity of copper, not because the mirror image is not perfect. If you had a high-temperature superconducting plate instead of copper and could freeze-in the field of magnets by the process called &quot;field-cooling&quot;, you wont need to rotate the magnets and supercurrents induced during the process of the superconducting transition would to a great deal create a very stable mirror-image of the field of the magnet. And of course no energy would be dissipated, due to infinite conductivity of the superconductor.", "comment_date": "2021-01-26T23:58:05Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Fred Flintstone", "comment_text": "I can do this with 8 nine volt batteries and a Faber Castel ruler.", "comment_date": "2021-01-26T03:02:51Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Miles Guillot", "comment_text": "the hacksmith just made a hover board based on this tech", "comment_date": "2021-01-24T06:17:41Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "jitesh kumar", "comment_text": "Can we use mercury in place of copper plate", "comment_date": "2021-01-23T05:25:20Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "alfonso dacullo", "comment_text": "very noisy! not that amazing", "comment_date": "2021-01-21T05:54:42Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "P Alagao", "comment_text": "The early white separately call because romanian unpredictably trick apropos a tearful palm. rightful, irate hose", "comment_date": "2021-01-20T20:24:51Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Natty", "comment_text": "But we need to stabilize e115 first.

The day I saw this I thought of human travel. The &quot;UFO&quot; style air travel system I don&#39;t understand. It is apparently two CONTRA rotating discs with magnets at intervals (configuration, size etc I don&#39;t know) which overall produces a very high speed alternating magnetic field which apparently cancels all other effects around it. i.e. the world and all its effects on the craft are no longer there ! All you do to move is tilt one of the disks which acts like a gyroscope. i.e. if you were not holding it it would have moved away. Several effects have been witnessed by people coming across UFOs. All electronics die. This is because the alternating magnetic field is strong enough to stop electrons in a wire. In DC current as in a car, the electrons first go back and forth then the backwards and forwards motion is shortened then the electrons will be suspended at the same point when the car is close to the device i.e. all electrics fail. The fields are also strong enough to control light. People have witnessed a change in colour as a UFO is about to move. This is something to do with changing frequency of light waves. Skittish behaviour = our gravity system on Earth is quite high and the disk probes are designed for any planet so they move a lot quicker in our environment.

Lining a road with metal is probably too expensive, even if it&#39;s only channels like a rail rather than the whole lane width. Acceleration would probably be quite slow, maybe good momentum for efficient linear travel... until you need to stop. No locked tires to grip the road, so what, another thruster on the front to push the opposite direction? That would be a very slow deceleration.

This is a problem because once you breach it&#39;s structural integrity you get an implosion which is a large potential hazard.
