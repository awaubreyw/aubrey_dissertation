The string itself is not moving. It has no action so not energy is being used on it. However the two weights pull the string downward with the help of gravity and the additional weight. If what I took from TheActionLab is correct then that is newly applied energy to do nothing. Just sit there. But this is causing friction with the contact of the ice which is transferred into heat \u201cmelting\u201d the ice. It\u2019s more about the friction FROM the pressure. Not pressure itself. If we compacted the ice tighter and tighter and tighter while excluding friction the Ice won\u2019t melt. It\u2019ll crumble as the volume of the ice has no where to go but inside itself. But if you applied friction to this example, the ice would melt as the friction coming from all angles is being transferred into heat. Pressure does not melt. Friction does. Diamonds for example are creating by applied immense pressure which causes heat to change carbon molecule structures. Why ground layers are fused together due to pressure surrounding all sides. Now the refreezing is just ice making contact with colder Ice. There\u2019s more colder Ice than warm ice so the balance is to freeze again. You can combine metals in a similar way known as cold welding. Two metals can be combined with enough pressure. Two Aluminum foil sheets can be combined together into one sheet.  The reason why we can\u2019t do it in our average home is because there is an oxygen layer on both the sheets. (If  someone had a vacuum chamber in their home then it can be plausible to combine the layers)This impacts the molecules of the metals retracting the attraction they have towards each other. It\u2019s like trying to stick something on a wet wall. You gotta dry before you stick something. I would recommend watching TheActionLab. He explains everything and finds a deeper understanding of what\u2019s going on. The type of welding we see here is not cold welding. But actually regular welding. you melt super hot metal and apply it to either multiple or singular pieces of metal. The melted metal interacts with the colder medal. If done incorrectly you get what is known as cold shuts. When the the same molecule (doesn\u2019t have to be the same but is usually common in inexperienced welders) is in two different temperatures that creates too much stress on the metal and cracks.

Recent progress [Sun, et al., J Phys Chem Lett 2013. 4: 3238 and Chem Sci 2012. 3: 1455] inspired us to resolve this anomaly from the perspective of hydrogen bond (O:H-O) recoverability and water quasi-solid phase boundary dispersion. Compression shortens the length dL, increases the energy EL and phonon-frequency \uf077L of the O:H nonbond whereas the H-O bond responses oppositely to compression. O:H-O bond recovers its original state completely along its potential paths once the pressure is removed and oxygen atom finds bonding partners to retain its sp3-orbital hybridization once the O:H nonbond breaks. Theoretical reproduction of observations confirmed that the Ex and \uf077x reversible relaxation modulates, respectively, the integral and Debye temperature of the respective specific heat \uf068x(T) (x = L and H for the O:H and H-O bond) whose superposition creates retractable quasi-solid phase boundaries or critical temperatures for phase transition.

The exception of water is due to the fact that ice is less dense than liquid water, due to the lattice configuration specific to water. The theory of regelation is a phenomenon that only occurs for such substances.<br><br>If you look at the phase envelope of water, you can see that increasing pressure up to the triple point (the condition at which a substance can exist as either gas, liquid, our solid) at 0.006 atm, the freezing point (technically called deposition in this case, or gas to solid) in fact increases until it reaches the triple point of 0.1 C. Obviously, this window is very small and hardly measurable in the real world. But once that triple point is exceeded in pressure, assuming the temperature of the body stays constant, the freezing temperature (or melting temperature in this case) begins to decrease, as the pressure exerted on the solid interface exceeds the strength of the solid lattice. This is why it takes a relatively significant pressure to actually observe this.<br><br>Another thing to note is the added effect of using wire with high thermal conductivity, allowing significantly more heat transfer between the surrounding air and the point of contact than if say, a nylon high E string was used for this experiment. Transversely, I imagine you would see a significantly faster effect using copper wire. It would be interesting to see the three conditions side by side to take a look at how much heat transfer is effecting the situation. You could probably determine this if you had accurate measurements of the surrounding temperature and pressure, calculated the effective pressure exerted by the wire, and compared the rate of melting to the phase envelope and what you would expect to see assuming no heat transfer.

You can think of changing atmospheric pressure as a way to stretch (lower pressure) or compress (higher pressure) an area of gas/liquid/solid. Pressure does slightly affect all materials melting &amp; boiling points. For the majority of materials that shrink when &quot;frozen&quot;, or solid, &quot;stretching&quot; it by lowering the pressure, say by putting it in a vacuum (or a place with much lower than atmospheric pressure), will cause it to melt at a lower temperature.", "comment_date": "2013-05-09T17:45:32Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Beta Mind", "comment_text": "lol the E and G string joke", "comment_date": "2013-05-08T21:00:37Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Jeremia", "comment_text": "Well, Water is one of the few materials that EXPAND when frozen, and become LESS dense...
