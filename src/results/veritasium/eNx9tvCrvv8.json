Climate denialism, takes a lousy swing and a miss at one of them, and they will get 3 months denialist publicity even though the flaws in the logic of the swing was discovered the very next day. Science is all about trying to break things to either disprove past knowledge, or add further evidence to the already known knowledge. But the media and the joe averages really need to know, to actually truly disprove climate change now, you really need to cut off every single head of the hydra with good quality science and not the junk science that always seems to get the media attention.", "comment_date": "2021-10-15T10:30:52Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "KURASAKI81", "comment_text": "CO2 emmission from animal agriculture?

Not that race matters, but a vastly disproportionate amount of middle and lower-class people are black. Is this the systemic racism that the democrats wield so adeptly?<br>-It has the effect of enabling gangster-ocracies and communist countries like India and China at the expense of flourishing democracies. Why would we reduce our comparative advantage over such nations?<br>-It destabilizes working families. See the ongoing yellow-vest protests.<br>-It actually produces more environmental waste than it prevents. Solar and other alternative forms of energy have an enormous cost to the environment from mining, purification, supply chain transportation, and construction.<br>-A more effective (no really, look it up) way of reducing emissions is deregulating fracking. This is why the carbon emissions of the US have decreased while energy expenditure has gone up. Contrast again with India and China.<br>-Unilateral economic disarmament is not a solution. Our enemies will use whatever means available to them--as they do at this very moment--to increase the size, power, and robustness of their economies. Artificially suppressing the United States economy paves the way for forces of chaos and tyranny to flourish.<br><br>Thus, it is easily shown that in the prisoners&#39; dilemma in which we find ourselves with regard to the comparative advantages we have among other nations, a carbon tax is not Pareto-optimized and should not therefore be pursued. It is not remotely Pareto-optimized. In fact, it benefits a very small cadre of globalists along with corrupt and tyrannical regimes while disadvantaging everyone else. The 1% win while the 99% lose, but get to feel righteous while they march inexorably toward bankruptcy, tyranny and cultural annihilation.

What scientists should be doing is stating the fact that we have gone from 264ppm to 400ppm and that while a minor rise it can cause small rises in temperature if there are no feedback cycles.  This can and might cause planet wide greening, possibly strong storms (or weaker ones due to more energy in the atmosphere creating more chaos and thus preventing organized storms from forming as often).  They should then point out that while carbon has been as high in the way past as 7000ppm the change we are making on the environment is slightly faster than purely natural (though humans are a natural part of earth and our brains make tech so could be argued that we are in fact natural) and this may cause stresses on other creatures and the environment.  They should then present a holistic commons sense plant to move to renewable energy, because as tech improves they start making sense, and well, oil is much more valuable for making things than burning.

The earth is about four billion years old and has always gone through stages of cooling down and heating up. CO2 is the gas of life. We breath it out, plants and treas breath it in then release oxygen, without one and another trees etc would not exit and neither would we. The oceans cover most of the planet and release CO2 as well. The more the better, it does not warm the planet as much as we are being told. They called it global warming originally but had to change it to climate change when they realised the average temperatures were slightly going down. They lie to us and try and brain wash us through the media etc etc for reasons to suit them. Their aim is for global control and profit from introducing green tax on systems etc saying they will cool the planet, but it will be going in their pockets and other things, not cooling the planet. Problem, action solution. Create the man made climate change lie, when man has almost nothing to do with it, wait for the reaction, protests etc, which is exactly what they want, then hey presto, offer the solution. New tax regimes. If they didn\u2019t create the lie, and just try and implement the new tax regimes, a lot of those climate protesters today would be out protesting against the new tax regimes. Fact. The scientists that agree with them are government funded through universities etc so their hands are tied and they can\u2019t speak freely and have to go along with the governments. The scientists who are independent whose hands are not tied will tell you the same as me but in much more details. They try to shut them up in various ways and even ban them from publishing their own facts in some cases. People need to look the proper facts up and realise what\u2019s going on. The main cause for global cooling or warming is down to decreased or increased solar activity on the surface of the sun. The solar rays from increased sun spot activity break through the earths atmosphere and warm the oceans slightly. Also the moon is affected which effects the tides, and it effects the jet steam moving it slightly  up or down, which\u2019s effects the weather one way or another above it it and below it. I will say this though. I am all for the local environment issues. Car exhaust fumes etc which effect people with bronchitis etc and skin problems. The waste plastic in our oceans needs to be addressed too and other issues. Check out piers corbyn for climate facts. He is an independent scientist as well as many others. CO2 does not create warming, it follows it. Also when the temperature goes down it then follows that too, but there is an 8 hundred year lag before it starts to follow it due to the slower temperature changes in the oceans. Most of the planet is ocean and the warmer they are the more CO2 they emit. The charts originally showed that lag too with the spikes in temperature and CO2 being 8 hundred years apart but they falsified the charts and put both the spikes together to make it look like CO2 was to blame to suit their own agenda as explained above. If they were so worried about man made CO2 then why do they not do something about termites which create ten times more CO2 than we do ?. Out of the whole atmosphere only about 0.04 percent of it is CO2 and only about 4 percent of that 0.04 percent is man made. Also think about this one. Why are developers investing in building all around the world on coast lines if they think in about 20 years time they will be flooded? Also why are the banks investing money to those developers to help them build, and providing long term mortgages to people to buy those properties etc on the coast lines? The answer to that is they know damn well that man made climate change is a hoax. I will mention again, check out piers corbyn and others, independent scientists, not government funded, hands not tied and can speak freely without the risk of loosing their livelihood. Again think about this. Out of the whole of the earths atmosphere, only about 0.04 percent of it is CO2. From that, only 4 percent of that 0.04 percent is CO2 that is man made.

The strongest portion of the sun&#39;s magnetism is closer to its North and South Pole than it is to its equatorial line. The Solar System is traveling at an average speed of 230 km/s (828,000 km/h) around the galactic center, when the heliosphere comes in contact with Galactic dust, the dust that doesn&#39;t get through is compressed against the magnetic wall of the heliosphere. These particles are forced to slip along the heliosphere&#39;s magnetic field lines accelerating from the pressure of the cosmic dust consistently pressing against the heliosphere as its travels, because new dust is constantly bombarding  the heliosphere as it travels around the Galaxy. A large quantity of this debris floods into the heliosphere&#39;s crowns that encircles each pole of the Sun. The speed of these particles are accelerated by this process to speeds much greater than the solar wind. There is only about 3 probes that could confirm this Theory Voyager 1 and 2, and they are not Advanced enough nor do they have enough power to truly monitor heliosphere activity, the systems on those probes are being shut down to preserve power. I believe the Japanese have one probe that orbits the Sun specifically to monitor it&#39;s polar activity, once again it either lacks the technology, or The Operators simply don&#39;t know what to look for. When our heliosphere enters the magnetic field lines that stretches out fom the galactic core, the places where Cosmic dust accumulates most densely. The pressure between our heliosphere and the cosmos increases greatly and the speeds in which the dust travels is increased as well. The coronal hole masses at each pole are always there because the dust has always been there, coming in to the Sun, first to aid in the creation of it and after to fuel it, only it comes in at different rates depending on planetary alignments and the heliospheres position in the galaxy, as it travels through galactic magnetic field lines of structured dust density differences. The Milky Way&#39;s magnetic field structure is complicated, do to all of the various different dust, gas, stars, etc. That adds to the complexity of it&#39;s field. If you take away all these stars, dust, etc., and leave the galactic core then it&#39;s magnetic fields uniformity and cyclical nature are revealed. This uniformity is there with or without the other stars, planets, quasars, etc. it&#39;s just been added too, masked, and compounded when they are present. These cyclical galactic field lines my even be directly responsible for our solar cycles, and the planetary alignments my only play a small part in the cycles intensity. I downloaded an app called Solar System Scope, and I used it so that I could type in dates of years with record temperatures to see if it would illustrate planetary alignments, and it had appeared that every significant alignment had contributed to extreme weather anomalies during the minimums, and maximums, however I could find no consistency that would explain solar Cycles. Back to magnetic fields. The Milkyway&#39;s magnetic field is made up of fairly consistent distances between each field line. It most likely takes 22yrs for the Heliospheres to travel from one significant field line to the next. This would explain all of the phenomena that happens during a solar cycle. <br><br>1. The sun&#39;s field reversal would happen when it enters the galactic magnetic field line, depending on witch hemisphere of the galaxy it is in. The <br>2. The minimums would occur apon aproch, passing through, and exiting galactic field lines.<br>3. Hale that occurs during minimums, do to the density of the dust in the galactic field lines. <br>4. Coronal hole activity increase from the extra dust, gas, and debris that accumulate at the galactic field lines. <br>5. The weakening of the heliospheres do to galactic magnetic interference, resulting in the Sun&#39;s magnetic reversal<br><br>Some hipothisis are that the Milky Way galaxy is a two arm spiral galaxy. The arms of the Milky Way line up with Galactic field lines, this would be one of the strongest field lines, do to Compounded Galactic magnetic field resonance. Meaning that all the matter in that arm, stars, planets, gas, dust etc. would add to the magnetic field line strength.

If this happened you would kill people by 0.0001% per day because my planet is in perfect condition right now. The planet lives for ever how I intended.  Stop this crap about the planet going to die because the planet does not die in any kind of way. Even if you tried to blow the planet up you couldn&#39;t because my heirachy will arrive in ufos... These people are thick.. Amun Ra Xeus. Look actually your not clever the airs on the inside the wind and blows out all negative while plants help to purified aswell.

That means that our current CO2 levels are the result of Earth&#39;s overall temperature 800 years ago.  World leaders have convinced their dependents that this works in the reverse order, relatively quickly, and that we are to blame, so that they can tax us out of a false shared guilt in order to be able to afford to &quot;fight&quot; climate change, an unstoppable natural cycle.  The following is the source of this information:<br><br>Historical Carbon Dioxide Record from the Vostok Ice Core<br><br>Investigators<br>J.-M. Barnola, D. Raynaud, C. Lorius<br>Laboratoire de Glaciologie et de G\u00e9ophysique de l&#39;Environnement,<br>CNRS, BP96,<br>38402 Saint Martin d&#39;Heres Cedex, France<br><br>N.I. Barkov<br>Arctic and Antarctic Research Institute,<br>Beringa Street 38, 199397,<br>St. Petersburg, Russia<br><br>Period of Record<br>417,160 - 2,342 years BP<br><br>Methods<br>In January 1998, the collaborative ice-drilling project between Russia, the United States, and France at the Russian Vostok station in East Antarctica yielded the deepest ice core ever recovered, reaching a depth of 3,623 m (Petit et al. 1997, 1999). Ice cores are unique with their entrapped air inclusions enabling direct records of past changes in atmospheric trace-gas composition. Preliminary data indicate the Vostok ice-core record extends through four climate cycles, with ice slightly older than 400 kyr (Petit et al. 1997, 1999). Because air bubbles do not close at the surface of the ice sheet but only near the firn-ice transition (that is, at ~90 m below the surface at Vostok), the air extracted from the ice is younger than the surrounding ice (Barnola et al. 1991). Using semiempirical models of densification applied to past Vostok climate conditions, Barnola et al. (1991) reported that the age difference between air and ice may be ~6000 years during the coldest periods instead of ~4000 years, as previously assumed. Ice samples were cut with a bandsaw in a cold room (at about -15\u00b0C) as close as possible to the center of the core in order to avoid surface contamination (Barnola et al. 1983). Gas extraction and measurements were performed with the &quot;Grenoble analytical setup,&quot; which involved crushing the ice sample (~40 g) under vacuum in a stainless-steel container without melting it, expanding the gas released during the crushing in a pre-evacuated sampling loop, and analyzing the CO2 concentrations by gas chromatography (Barnola et al. 1983). The analytical system, except for the stainless-steel container in which the ice was crushed, was calibrated for each ice sample measurement with a standard mixture of CO2 in nitrogen and oxygen. For further details on the experimental procedures and the dating of the successive ice layers at Vostok, see Barnola et al. (1987, 1991), Lorius et al. (1985), and Petit et al. (1999).<br><br>Trends<br>There is a close correlation between Antarctic temperature and atmospheric concentrations of CO2 (Barnola et al. 1987). The extension of the Vostok CO2 record shows that the main trends of CO2 are similar for each glacial cycle. Major transitions from the lowest to the highest values are associated with glacial-interglacial transitions. During these transitions, the atmospheric concentrations of CO2 rises from 180 to 280-300 ppmv (Petit et al. 1999). The extension of the Vostok CO2 record shows the present-day levels of CO2 are unprecedented during the past 420 kyr. Pre-industrial Holocene levels (~280 ppmv) are found during all interglacials, with the highest values (~300 ppmv) found approximately 323 kyr BP. When the Vostok ice core data were compared with other ice core data (Delmas et al. 1980; Neftel et al. 1982) for the past 30,000 - 40,000 years, good agreement was found between the records: all show low CO2 values [~200 parts per million by volume (ppmv)] during the Last Glacial Maximum and increased atmospheric CO2 concentrations associated with the glacial-Holocene transition. According to Barnola et al. (1991) and Petit et al. (1999) these measurements indicate that, at the beginning of the deglaciations, the CO2 increase either was in phase or lagged by less than ~1000 years with respect to the Antarctic temperature, whereas it clearly lagged behind the temperature at the onset of the glaciations.<br><br>References<br>Barnola, J.-M., D.

Then chosen examples are shown to back up a point of view as if to suggest that all opposition is similarly false.  We are told that our brains are not good enough to see longer term danger but at the same time we witness those who lecture to us take action in total opposition themselves.  When an American president lectures us about climate change and then spends a fortune buying a  beach-side property, on a small island then you cannot blame those brains from seeing a &#39;do as we say&#39; not &#39;do as we do&#39;  situation.  And when the purchase of this mansion is kept quiet on mainstream news, who otherwise would be eager to point out the house is about 10 feet above sea level, you cannot blame people for reacting against the messengers as well as the message.", "comment_date": "2019-09-20T07:09:14Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "West Wind", "comment_text": "Apart from any industrial propagandism, there are some very seasoned climate scholars, heretics that have raised questions and have meticulously explained (on YT)<br>* how little we know<br>* that the current focus on C02 is unbalanced or without merit, for compelling reasons<br>* that the figure of 97% is not substantiated / might as well be applied to the fraction of sceptic scientists<br>* that corporate funding of science is beginning to play a big role in skewing the debate and further development of the science community <br>* that industries and int. finance are set up to profit of the CO2 policies (that society will pay dearly for). <br>Btw, the present hot summer had beeen predicted by studies of the varying effects of sun and moon.<br><br><br>In my view, the current debate lacks integrity.

The cartel can take deserts that don&#39;t grow trees or gress and use that for their carbon offsets but if you make machines that extract CO 2 from the air you can&#39;t get carbon offsets .Then you dig deeper you find out that Russia China  Japan India reputable universities will laugh you off the place if you say humans create enough CO2 TO COOK OUR GOOSE. That&#39;s because these real unvercities outside western Europe don&#39;t get funds to promote junk science that the. Western world promotes like CO2 boogie man . Top western science is for sale to the highest bidder as in smoking is good for your health and these western science whores will sell any snake oil for the right  price and presently CO 2 boogie man is the great money  supply to say CO will cook our goose . I been looking climate change since the early 70 s era when they said that the ice age commeth . Then as they changed I swallowed this CO2 cool aid for a few years until I went looking how  to buy carbon offsets . Then you hit the biggest dung heap ever invented to rip your face and you follow the money and the scam CO2 and the rest  is exposed", "comment_date": "2019-03-24T20:57:06Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Virgo Bro", "comment_text": "Reedit clickbait", "comment_date": "2019-03-18T16:10:42Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Doctor Bronze", "comment_text": "actually Armageddon is not technical a asteroid hitting earth it is according to the bible the end of the world i don&#39;t remember exactly how it says the end of the world will be but its actually where it will start Armageddon (a.k.a har megedon: \u05d4\u05e8 \u05de\u05d2\u05d3\u05d5\u05df) is a location in Israel that was falsely translated and turned into the name of the end of the world instead of the name of the location where is would be", "comment_date": "2019-03-15T04:05:12Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "LudvigIndestrucable", "comment_text": "I find complex probabilistic models deeply terrifying", "comment_date": "2019-03-14T16:13:12Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Brian King", "comment_text": "So... we have a problem.

To be Objective, you must look at data. My problem with &quot;Climate Change&quot; Is the agenda driven manipulation of data, where the IPCC, NASA, and many other government scientists clearly have an agenda. When the IPCC, and NASA put out reports about temperature rise, and manipulate, and cherry pick data, and ice levels, it makes it hard to take them seriously, as they are going against the data, and more towards &quot;climate models&quot; <br>Yes C02 levels are rising in our atmosphere, but it&#39;s much more complicated than that. Every climate model that has ever been looked at has not been capable of accurately predicting the future, and climate alarmists have been continually wrong for decades predicting sea level rise, and temperature rise, and ice recession in the arctics. Many climate scientists used to believe that the earth was cooling, and we were headed for the next ice age in the 70&#39;s, for example. Climate alarmists have also seem to have forgotten that some of the hottest periods on planet earth in recent history was the 1930&#39;s and 1940&#39;s. Why is it that people don&#39;t discuss this? I really recommend you check out some lectures from Tony Heller here on youtube, they are fantastic! I&#39;m not denying that we are dumping high levels of C02 into the atmostphere, but i am not in agreement that X PPM c02 is going to cause catastrophic climate change, or a runaway reaction, which some scientists have published data showing it is highly unlikely in the near future, especially since it seems to be the atmospheric pressure that affects the temperature, not the c02 content. If this was the case, Mars would be extremely hot, as it contains more C02 than earth!

First, the whole narrative depends on a mostly meaningless metric - global average temperature anomaly.  Think about that for a minute or two.  In any given place on the globe, temperature changes on a cyclical basis over the course of a 24- hour day, from a daily low, typically just before sunrise, to a daily high, typically several hours after noon, then falling slowly overnight to the next day\u2019s low temperature.  So, you average out the day\u2019s high and low temperature, a range that might be only a few degrees, but might be as much as 20 degrees F on a given day, to find the average daily temperature for that location.  Then you take that average, and average it out with the average daily temperature for every other place on Earth.  So what?  A completely meaningless metric.  Second, there is ZERO persuasive empirical evidence that atmospheric CO2 is the primary driver of warming, or even a material driver of warming. The Earth\u2019s climate has been constantly changing over its entire 4.5 Billion year history, either cooling or warming.  Just in the last 12,000 years, a blink of an eye in geological terms, Earth\u2019s climate has gone through several cycles warmer than today, from the Holocene Optimum, about 6,000-4,500 years ago, the Roman Warm Period, and the Medieval Warm Period, ALL warmer by 2-4 degrees C than today, and NONE caused by atmospheric CO2.  Climate scientists can\u2019t even identify or quantify the many natural causes of climate change, like solar cycles, changes in solar magnetic activity, changes in ocean currents, etc., yet we are supposed to believe the story that it is all (or even mostly) CO2?

Many people think that if government policy would focus on punishing these oil companies and coal companies that the problem would be solved, and they could just go on living the way they do.   I believe that if people really understood what carbon taxes would mean to their own pocket books-because no matter how much you may be able to tax oil and coal companies, you cannot force them to operate without a profit- there would be a lot less people blindly saying &quot;yeah, the government needs to do something!&quot;.    The other problem is that people tend to want to place blame for problems happening today on very specific people.  I&#39;ve seen people say storms should be named after George Bush since he and other &quot;climate change deniers&quot; are responsible for them.   A lot of people who believe in the climate science completely misunderstand it.  They believe for example that if we were to cut emissions back to 20% of 1990 levels that the earth&#39;s temperature would return to those same levels.  This type of ignorance makes debating them very simple.   People don&#39;t get that changes being suggested are really for the sake of people living over 50 years from now, that nothing we do right now can or will affect life in the near future, and when they say things like that they just cause an immediate negative defensive reaction to the person they are trying to pursuade.  That really is all I got from Al Gore&#39;s first movie by the way.-Republicans bad, me good.  As a progressive Republican actually interested in hearing what he said, I came away from the movie just thinking..&quot;what an ass&quot;.

If you have the data, you don&#39;t have to call names. The science speaks for itself.<br><br>One reason they have been able to get away with this is the lack of data to contradict them. That is, the data we have had up to now did not say what they claim it said -- but it didn&#39;t say anything else, either.<br><br>That&#39;s because everything was based on computer models, and computer models are only as good as the data that is fed into them. The people running the simulations were all True Believers, and so they always came up with &quot;results&quot; that mirrored the biased data they had been fed.<br><br>But finally there is real data to feed into the computers. In a Dec. 18th Wall Street Journal essay, Matt Ridley reports on a conversation with Nic Lewis, one of the educated people keeping tabs on the global warming science issues for those of us who don&#39;t have access to the latest reports.<br><br>If it weren&#39;t for people like Lewis, we laypeople would have no choice but to believe the deceptions of True Believers like the IPCC. Lewis is part of the reason we know about the previous lies and manipulations by the IPCC, but no one denies that the deceptions took place.<br><br>Now, however, because Lewis is an honest observer, he reports that real data shows that there is a genuine statistically probable effect from atmospheric carbon emissions.<br><br>What genuine scientists, faithfully reporting their actual findings, now report is that the mechanisms claimed to cause global warming may in fact contribute to a rise in temperature -- but they do so at a rate FAR, FAR LOWER than that assumed by the True Believers.<br><br>We are finally getting a pretty good idea of the actual effects of carbon dioxide emissions. Comparing global temperatures over the past 100-150 years with the fluctuations in carbon dioxide emissions from human activities gives us -- at last -- a reasonable basis for estimating how sensitive global climate is to changes in carbon dioxide levels.<br><br>Keep in mind that carbon dioxide is far from being the major greenhouse gas. Methane is far more important, and the most important, water vapor, has such unpredictable effects that it is left out of all the models.<br><br>That&#39;s because water vapor, besides being a greenhouse gas, also forms clouds, which by their high reflectivity, bounce sunlight out of the atmosphere without converting it to heat. Storms also funnel heat from near the surface up to the higher atmosphere.<br><br>We have no way of predicting or modeling how much the albedo and storm effects balance with the greenhouse effect, nor even to what degree global warming would increase cloud cover.<br><br>As Ridley says in his article, &quot;As one Nobel Prize-winning physicist with a senior role in combating climate change admitted to me the other day: &#39;We don&#39;t even know the sign&#39; of water vapor&#39;s effect -- in other words, whether it speeds up or slows down a warming of the atmosphere.&quot;<br><br>Says Ridley, &quot;Climate models are known to poorly simulate clouds, and given clouds&#39; very strong effect on the climate system -- some types cooling the Earth either by shading it or by transporting heat up and cold down in thunderstorms, and others warming the Earth by blocking outgoing radiation -- it remains highly plausible that there is no net positive feedback from water vapor.&quot;<br><br>This matters a great deal -- the global warming alarmists&#39; warnings absolutely depend on the idea that carbon dioxide&#39;s warming, if real, will then be greatly amplified by water vapor increases. But this remains entirely a matter of faith. For all we know, increased water vapor may be the ecosystem&#39;s natural way of damping down the effects of global warming -- whether that warming is astronomical or human caused.<br><br>We can now calculate with some reliability just what a doubling of the amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere would do to global climate. &quot;Given what we know now,&quot; said Ridley, &quot;there is almost no way that the feared large temperature rise is going to happen.&quot;<br><br>Ridley quotes Lewis as saying that, assuming a doubling of CO2 -- the IPCC&#39;s worst-case scenario -- and even assuming &quot;another 30% rise from other greenhouse gases by 2100, we are likely to experience a further rise of no more than&quot; one degree Celsius.<br><br>Says Ridley, &quot;A cumulative change of less than 2O C by the end of this century will do no net harm. It will actually do net good -- that much the IPCC scientists have already agreed upon in the last IPCC report. Rainfall will increase slightly, growing seasons will lengthen, Greenland&#39;s ice cap will melt only very slowly.&quot;<br><br>Historical evidence shows that global temperatures have been warmer than they are now, following natural cycles alone, in historical times. There seems to be a regular warming-and-cooling cycle, with cooling represented by the Little Ice Age of 1350 to 1850. In 1000 a.d., global climate was warmer than it is now.<br><br>The same cycle seems to have corresponded with the collapse of agriculture and population during the cooling phase in the late Roman Empire and through the Dark Ages -- a plague-ridden era like the Little Ice Age.<br><br>The historical evidence suggests that eras of global warming are natural, that they are beneficial, that they can best be called &quot;good weather.&quot;<br><br>When you add to this the fact that all of human history has taken place in a ten thousand year lull in the great Ice Age that has dominated the last million years of Earth&#39;s climate history, and I, for one, wish that we could control and warm the climate through mere carbon dioxide emissions -- because when the major astronomical cycles bring back the Ice Age, our descendants will very much wish for a means of causing global warming on a vast scale.<br><br>Meanwhile, keep in mind that there is nothing unnatural about the carbon dioxide we release into the atmosphere. All the carbon in the coal and oil and natural gas that we dig or pump up from under the surface was once atmospheric carbon dioxide.<br><br>Carbon dioxide is fertilizer for all plant life. For millions of years, the coastal jungles of the dinosaur era sequestered natural atmospheric carbon dioxide and kept it out of circulation.<br><br>In effect, we have starved for CO2 for millions of years because all those plants selfishly drank up all the atmospheric carbon they could and then thoughtlessly died without returning it to the atmosphere.<br><br>We&#39;re only putting it back where it started.<br><br>And every serious climate scientist has to admit this fact: Whatever else our carbon dioxide emissions might be doing, they are definitely fertilizing forests and grasslands all around the world. Where humans are involved, that means orchards and grainfields.<br><br>If we really did reduce our CO2 emissions, it would cause a worldwide decrease in crop yields. That&#39;s a fact, not a computer model.<br><br>The real limiting factor should be this: The supply of oil and coal is finite. It was larger than the alarmists of the 1970s and 1980s supposed, but that doesn&#39;t mean that we will never run out. It is quite possible that in a mere two centuries of fossil fuel consumption, we will use up the entire supply of accessible sequestered carbon.<br><br>That, not groundless fears of global warming, is the reason we need to find other means of generating energy. Instead of worrying about carbon emissions, we need to search desperately for a means of powering our transportation and heating and cooling our habitations that does not depend on a resource that, once it runs out, is gone forever.<br><br>My fear is that because of all the lies and deceptions, all the oppression of dissent and nastiness of the global warming alarmists, the general public, once free of those delusions and lies, will think that all warnings and dangers are false.<br><br>In other words, we have been through three decades of massive wolf-crying about a nonexistent wolf, so that people won&#39;t believe in the need to deal with the real wolf of depleting resources.<br><br>We have a responsibility to future generations to leave them with the resources necessary to sustain a modern society. It is a sin to burn it all up when we don&#39;t have to. CO2 is a non-issue and always has been -- only the eco-puritans took it seriously and then foisted it on laypeople who trusted in &quot;science.&quot;<br><br>The net effect of their falsehoods will be a loss of trust in real science, and that&#39;s a crime. Because there are dangers to the environment, and serious consequence from burning up resources that can never be renewed.

That is just a baseless prediction with no empirical reasoning behind it, just a faith in models that aren&#39;t very soundproof. The basis of science is empiricism.

Not sure if somebody has answered your question about why Australia repealed it&#39;s carbon tax.<br><br>The new Prime Minister of Australia, Tony Abbot (I say new, but he was elected about a year ago) was opposed to the &quot;Carbon Tax&quot; when past Prime Minister Julia Gillard first proposed it since she had originally said that she wouldn&#39;t, Abbot considered it a breach of the trust of the Australian people, and used to it prop up his attack-dog tactics that resulted in him winning the election. Abbot made a big fuss about how much the carbon price would affect families and regular people day to day life, claiming that annual expenses would increase everywhere, even down to the weekly groceries. He called it the &quot;The big new tax&quot; or something like that, and made it his key election promise that he would remove the carbon tax if he was elected to office.<br>That is how it happened in the public&#39;s eye, but the reasons behind repealing the carbon price was not the attempt to make good on Julia Gillard&#39;s promise she made 5 years ago, but it&#39;s because Australia&#39;s biggest exports are Iron Ore and Coal. Both are heavily polluting industries that were hit fairly hard by the carbon tax, The mining industry in Western Australia was the major factor in keeping Australia from going into recession along with the rest of the world in the GFC (the then-government&#39;s &quot;stimulus package&quot; also played a role).

It makes other people rich, and it pollutes the environment. What effects our environment effects us.\u00a0<br>How do we get rid of this cheap, abundant, and addictive substance that our cars need to get us from point A to B? We use something else; i.e. algae, solar panels, wind power, ethanol, hydrogen, steam, &quot;clean coal&quot;. If it&#39;s not petroleum, then it&#39;s okay. -though, logically that&#39;s stupid. We&#39;ll get to that later.<br>The real answer is Electricity. Did you know that Edison had an electric car in 1901? Did you also know that people were converting combustion car engines to use hydrogen in the 1970s? The technology exists...but no one bought into it because it wasn&#39;t cost effective. Now...we&#39;re running out of oil....so we need an energy race to find the thing that will replace our energy needs.\u00a0<br>How do we do this? We motivate people to coming up with more ideas...cheaper ideas. The cheaper it is, the more people will buy into it. -And that&#39;s a great thing. As you see, electricity is the most abundant energy source in the universe. Solar Flares that come into contact with the Earth&#39;s outer atmosphere wreak havoc on communications satellites, analog phone lines, radio communications, etc. Why? Because it is an electrical phenomena. &quot;When air or gas is ionized, plasma forms with conductive properties similar to those of metals. Plasma is the most abundant form of matter in the Universe, because most stars are in a plasma state.&quot; ...&quot;Ionization is the process by which an atom or a molecule acquires a negative or positive charge by gaining or losing electrons to form ions.&quot;<br>There you have it. The most abundant form of matter in the universe is essentially ionized gas. Gas with a positive or negative electrical charge.<br>Now, if we are to advance as a civilization and a species, the next phase in our evolution is energy mastery and efficiency. If we can utilize all of the energy that gets used, and re-use it, then we will cease to have any energy woes. Clean energy exists all around us....but we only came upon this energy revolution AFTER Global Warming/Climate Change was presented to us as a real threat.<br>I for one, believe that it is real, but that it is greatly exaggerated, and not fully understood, as scientists always seem to have to chase their tale when their climate predictions fail to be as terrible as predicted, or when the global climate temperature holds steady for over a decade.

And also why are you standing around trying to get people hear your words and believe in your cause instead of using your ingenuity and creativity to tell people about a new means of recycling materials, recycling energy, storing energy more efficiently, etc, etc. Stop professing...start building.

A carbon tax doesn&#39;t seem to be a solution. It&#39;s not like it&#39;s creating an alternative energy source. It&#39;s just costing you more to continue using the amount of carbon you&#39;ve become accustomed to.  <br>Rather than running to the government every time there&#39;s a problem in business and telling them to fix it, people should just use the power of being a consumer.  If you don&#39;t like Mcdonalds because it&#39;s not healthy or ethical, then STOP eating it. They are a business, they are here for ONE thing, your money. And if they aren&#39;t getting it then they will either adapt to the changes you want or go out of business. <br>If we want to see changes in carbon consumption in energy then first we need someone to take a risk and implement a better system.

So, <b>what</b> do 97% of climate scientists agree on, exactly? Two assertions:<br>1. Temperatures have generally risen over the past 200 years<br>2. Human activity is a significant factor in changing mean global temperatures.<br><br>Conspicuously absent from this is how big of a role humans played, and how this will continue in the future. That&#39;s right, it is not true that 97% of climate scientists agree that a carbon tax is a good idea (but more on that later).<br><br>Second, the climate predictions you see publicized are based on computer models that ignore <b>crucial</b> features of climate dynamics, such as cloud cover and the role of chemistry and biology. These models are only validated from their ability to predict present data from past data, which is obvious because they were designed to reproduce the historical data in the first place. They are <b>not</b> validated to predict future data, not by a long shot. That&#39;s why you often hear numbers for climate sensitivity (the rise in temperature given a doubling of CO2 concentration -- it&#39;s logarithmic) that are, quite frankly, absurd. 10 degrees Celsius? Please. No evidence whatsoever suggests that, apart from what you get from a model -- the historical, <b>observed</b> climate sensitivity is closer to 1 degree. &quot;But climate is dominated by positive feedback loops&quot;, I hear you say. Well, if it were, we would already be at those higher temperatures, wouldn&#39;t we? Natural fluctuations would&#39;ve been enough to kick the system over to its fixed point. At the very least, fluctuations of similar amplitude as the predictions should have been observed; climate may not be as hectic as weather, but it is <b>still</b> chaotic in the precise definition of the term.\u00a0<br><br>Third, even assuming that it&#39;s true, asking people &quot;what are you doing about climate change&quot; is disingenuous because there&#39;s nothing that the average person CAN do. Any action has to be taken at the policy-making level. Walking to work and taking shorter showers is going to do diddly squat about it.<br><br>Fourth, there are vested interests in both sides of this issue. If you think that Al Gore is doing advocacy for this out of the goodness of his heart you should be ashamed of your naivet\u00e9. There&#39;s a lot of money to be made in this, and you can see shills in both sides, just as you can see honest people in both sides. Attack the arguments, not the person making them.<br><br>Fifth, those who stand to lose if a price is put on carbon are essentially all of us. What do you think, that oil companies are going to reduce their profit margins? Of course they&#39;re not, they&#39;re going to pass the increased costs to the consumer. All consumer products will suddenly become more expensive because of the now higher transportation overhead. The people who are impacted the most are of course the poor: the person who needs to buy fuel to keep warm in the winter (FYI, you might want to look at how many people have been dying of cold for that reason in the UK). The people who global warming advocates claim will be the most affected by climate change are also the ones most affected by climate change mitigation policies. The evil businessman in a suit? He&#39;ll manage. He always does.<br><br>Sixth, climate change is <b>not</b> like Armageddon. Even if the direst predictions are confirmed. That&#39;s emotionally charged language, which I realize is somewhat the point of your video, but it&#39;s also extremely misleading. It sounds like you&#39;re saying that the Earth will become like Venus, which nobody believes, not even you.<br><br>Seventh, if their direst predictions aren&#39;t realized, that is, if global warming continues with a climate sensitivity similar to the historical 1 kelvin, we&#39;re looking at an <b>improved</b> biosphere, where the good effects outweigh the bad. Seriously, it&#39;s on the last IPCC report.<br><br>Eighth, I believe it&#39;s been made clear by now but it pays to reiterate <b>why</b> the carbon tax has been repealed. Policy makers realized it&#39;s bad for the economy. And remember, when it&#39;s bad for the economy, it&#39;s not bad for the mustache twirling businessman, it&#39;s bad for the average Joe. Here&#39;s a crazy thought: climate change disproportionately affects the poor, right? So instead of trying to mitigate climate change which will allegedly be Armageddon wrought upon us by all the technologies we depend on, how about we... reduce poverty?

Now we have this out of the way, lets see the problems -<br><br>First and foremost, over the years it has became a business and a propaganda machine.Govts. are not doing anything more than just a lip service. They talk about how global warming is bad and how people should use bicycles instead of their cars and then go and start handful of wars so some elite can make profit. People are justified to not believe in govt, because govt = bullshit.<br><br>Alternate to fossil fuel is very cheap and very feasible, you don&#39;t need some sci-fi power source providing unlimited energy, we already have one. But what has been done to harness the power sun releases all the time? We are pretty much at the same place we were 15 years ago. Yeah solar cells are cheaper, but they are still very inefficient and the and manufacturing them and the batteries to store the power causes more harm to climate than any good. We can use locally produced Ethanol and bio diesel, but then politicians making shitload of money off oil imports/exports will lose all that money, so why would they do it?<br><br>Developed countries love to point their finger at developing countries and say, &quot;Well look at them, they are burning coal and releasing all that CO2 in the air.. They should stop!!&quot; Nope! You can&#39;t ask any developing country to stop using coal as their electricity and industrial fuel, not without providing them with cheaper alternative. But they can&#39;t give all these country nuclear technology and material, we are left with nothing but just finger pointing blame game.\u00a0<br><br>Making electricity from Uranium is very expensive, because U235 virtually inseparable from U238, so to enrich the fuel, they use a very tedious and time consuming centrifuge technology. We could have switched to Thorium, but since Thorium cycle doesn&#39;t produce weapon grade Plutonium, research was cut short.<br><br>So you see, there&#39;s all talk but no solution for global warming. Govts. have done jackshit to solve the problem. Everyone bicycling to work is not a solution. We solve problems produced by technology with better technology, we don&#39;t take a step back and say, &quot;Yeah, that solves it&quot;!! The solution to Y2K was not to stop using computers and going back to pen and paper calculation, it was to rectify the problem root with better programming.<br><br>So any govt that is serious about providing a solution to global warming, will actually stop their lip service and bullshit and start funding massive research toward implementing alternative energy source that we have already found. \u00a0", "comment_date": "2014-09-07T18:30:52Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Paul Sod", "comment_text": "I am not a scientist but I try to keep myself informed of this issue. \u00a0From what I understand the science is NOT established and that there are reputable scientists throughout the world who are agnostic about (a) whether climate change is occurring and (b) whether humans are causing it. \u00a0It is NOT just big business with large vested interests that are opposing the scientific &quot;consensus&quot; that you say is so overwhelmingly uniform. \u00a0Will you not agree that the decade of the 1930s was the hottest decade in recorded history? \u00a0And will you also not agree that the past 10 years has been part of a cooling trend? \u00a0<br><br>The reality is that there are huge number of data points which must be included to accurately measure whether climate change is occurring. \u00a0Will you not also agree that it is absolutely impossible to get accurate measurements for most of the surface of the earth?<br><br>I just find it not credible to say that scientists &quot;know&quot; that climate change is occurring. \u00a0They may believe it to be occurring based on available evidence, but it really a long stretch from there to say that the scientific world uniformly knows it to be occurring.", "comment_date": "2014-09-07T16:52:35Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Zofia Kaminski", "comment_text": "I was kind of disappointed that no concrete steps were given for people to take.

In reply to &quot;scientists fake the research&quot; pointed out that the way science works is that it only takes one proof that something is wrong for a theory to be abandoned. That in 100 years not one paper has been written that proves CO2 isn&#39;t a driver of climate change. That the idea that the whole thing is faked depends on every single climate scientist being in on the scam and playing along for over a century, even the retired ones who&#39;s paycheck no longer depends on the scam.

A little over 200 years ago we were in the last grasp of the &quot;little ice age&quot; which started in the &quot;dark ages&quot; some 800+ years ago, and 10,000-20,000 years ago we had mile thick glaciers over much of North America.

This is the same science (or group think) that was screaming about Global Cooling and the coming New Ice Age in the 1970&#39;s due to dust and smog in the atmosphere, who used the hot days of summer with no Air Conditioning to convince and sell their point in the 1990&#39;s about the coming Global Warming, and now when their data and models haven&#39;t been accurate they change it to &quot;climate change&quot; and hope we&#39;ll swallow it all hook line and sinker yet again.<br><br>Climate Changes are the only thing constant about the Earth, it warms, it cools, we&#39;ve reportedly been a a Fire ball (early early earth) before being a lush tropical paradise, a Dustball global (or nearly global) desert, an Iceball with glacial ice covering all of the planet from pole to pole, and everywhere in between, sometimes those changes were fast, sometimes slow, and I&#39;m sure we&#39;ve even caused some changes due to deforestation, ground clearing, urban heat sinks due to denuding and paving of the land, and maybe even from our fossil fuel use as well as methane production from animal and biomass waste.

The majority of carbon dioxide is released by nature. Human activity is responsible for about 3%. The story is that this extra 3% is upsetting the delicate balance. If that were true then the atmosphere would be very sensitive to changes in the carbon dioxide content and a runaway condition could and would be expected to be possible.\u00a0<br><br>The climate does not care where the carbon dioxide comes from it simply reacts to it. The oceans are one of the great storage mediums of carbon dioxide. Cold water can hold more carbon dioxide in solution than warm water can. When it gets warmer the oceans release more of this gas but this gas is then trapped by trees and other vegetation. There are many other traps and sinks also at work. There has to be because we have not seen run away climate in the past. Again I must restate the climate does not care where the carbon dioxide comes from.<br><br>It can be argued that many other factors cause warming on a scale needed to affect the climate but the release of carbon dioxide has always happened after the warming in the past. Yes, carbon dioxide is a minor green house gas but it also seems to trigger activity which actually leads to cooling once the concentrations reach a certain level.<br><br>We do not fully understand how this happens as yet but one of the ways suggested is that because the climate is already warmer when the extra carbon dioxide is released from the oceans that this spurs greater plant growth and with the longer growing seasons this eventually changes the reflectivity index enough to trigger gradual cooling. Again this might only be the result and not the driving force.<br><br>The main reason for climate change is the total energy input to the system is not constant. Like many things in nature very small changes at the input side can have large changes at the out put. This is why I think that human activity has surely affected the climate but carbon dioxide output is not the major drivers of human influence. Particulants change the amount of energy that gets to the surface. Cities, roads, agriculture have all contributed but how much is under debate.\u00a0<br><br>Reasonable methods must be used to reduce contaminants released into the atmosphere but remember nature will still dwarf our activities. Volcanic eruptions spew millions upon millions of tons of contaminants. Under sea vents, eruptions and other massive geological events dwarf our contributions and are not constant but happen at seemingly unpredictable intervals and yet the climate has survived and remained habitable.\u00a0", "comment_date": "2014-08-31T04:11:27Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Knosis", "comment_text": "Climate change is NOT boring.

However when you pump in more Greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide and methane (comes from animals along with CO2) then the heat capacity of the atmosphere increases, so it can hold on to more heat than it could before, and this is what is the problem of Climate Change. The sources of these greenhouse gases are humans, human activities (cars, factories, power plants etc) as well as the increase in beef production across the planet (specifically developing nations whose people are turning more to beef for food).

Fine, let&#39;s say the science is sound:  and it&#39;s getting hotter and it&#39;s our fault.  So... what?  Yeah.  That&#39;s what I said: so what?  If you are shocked, this may indicate you suffer from bipolar politics disorder (don&#39;t worry, it&#39;s common), symptom: blindly assuming that politically charged issues admit of only two mutually exclusive stances.  In this case: 1) believe and care, or 2) deny and not care... but - I ask - what about 3) believe and... wonder what&#39;s the big deal!<br><br>Don&#39;t get me wrong, I love polar bears, penguins, and the sight of glaciers as much as the next guy.

Our planet is bound to get hotter, whether we help it or not.<br><br>So, first point.  The world isn&#39;t coming to an end, it&#39;s just getting a little hotter a little sooner.  Big deal.  Our planet has been there before.  Many times.  For millions of years at a time.  With thriving biodiversity, I&#39;m sure.  So, again... What&#39;s the big deal?  <br><br>Are we concerned with the loss of habitat of polar bears and penguins?  I&#39;m no ecologist, but how densely populated are the poles?  Won&#39;t the polar species just migrate north (and south, respectively) as the ice recedes? (And yes, I realize there are many other species involved)<br><br>In contrast, if you want to be concerned about loss of natural habitat, take a gander at the Amazon basin.  At the biodiversity there.  At the biodensity there (I don&#39;t know if that&#39;s a real word... I mean the amount (kilograms let&#39;s say) of living stuff per unit volume)  And look at the rate at which THAT is &quot;receding&quot;.  THAT worries me.<br><br>Which leads me to wonder... Wouldn&#39;t global warming lead to an expansion of tropical conditions?  More breathing room for all those tropical species losing THEIR homes?  I don&#39;t know.  I&#39;m just asking.  Because nobody else seems to be.<br><br>Sure the deserts will grow too, but last time I saw Planet Earth (the BBC series which my wife gave me for my birthday and which I love to watch) they managed to persuade me that the desert was a vibrant ecosystem... probably about as densely occupied as the arctic and Antarctic... So, break even?<br><br>Finally... yeah, flooding.  Loss of habitat for... um, yours truly.  Sure most of our cities will be affected.  We have this thing for beaches and ports.

One such was of seeing it is to look at sea levels. Over the past 100 years, sea levels have gradually increased, and will continue to increase.

Perhaps the concentrations themselves are not the problem but some of the consequences derived from this: increasing climactic variability, rising sea level, loss of human life from more extreme weather, biodiversity loss from ecosystem changes, etc. If the problem is the concentration themselves then the solutions aren&#39;t &quot;obvious&quot; since any solution [even the most extremely successful ones: no more meat production, no more driving!] would not have a noticeable effect for decades and in the meantime we&#39;re left with all these other issues associated with climate change to deal with.

There may be any number of reasons for this, it doesn&#39;t make them bad people, it just doesn&#39;t make them very convincing. I grew up in a &quot;climate change skeptic&quot; household, so I got exposed to that side of the story from an early age, including a good deal of propaganda, both obvious and subtle. As I got older, I began to warm up (harr harr) to the idea that there were two sides to this story and that I might be wrong. However, despite looking for answers and being entirely willing to be convinced, I haven&#39;t yet.<br><br>I am not a climatologist, and this means I can&#39;t use my own expertise in the are to come to a conclusion about the subject, but I should be able to use expertise in my own field as a &quot;subject matter depth gauge&quot; to help me avoid Dunning-Kruger, and maintain patience and respect for those who are SMEs in relevant fields. They are, after all, the ones who have something to teach me.<br><br>Even so, in searching I&#39;ve heard and seen very little but &quot;there&#39;s a scientific consensus&quot;, &quot;anything that contradicts it is made up by big oil, etc&quot;, and similar statements that seek to shut down my investigation, instead of giving me real answers or directing me to sources that could help tip the scale. Now, there may be very good reasons for this, chief among them that climate change proponents may be just dog tired of answering the same questions over and over.<br><br>We have your video, where you provide little explanation, frame people on the street as ignorant (they may be, but doing so comes very close to mockery), and then express frustration that there&#39;s contention about the subject. That&#39;s fine, especially if you&#39;ve explained yourself breathless, but whom will it convince? For me, I find it difficult to play ball with this, and much as I may want to, I can&#39;t change my mind based on it.<br><br>This isn&#39;t to say I&#39;ve never seen any convincing evidence that climate change is real, this video in particular is probably the single strongest piece of evidence I&#39;ve seen either way:\u00a0<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yze1YAz_LYM&amp;list=FLnamAXbyUg1naET1N597Zeg&amp;index=54\">Dan Britt - Orbits and Ice Ages: The History of Climate</a> However, it alone isn&#39;t enough to convince me (though it&#39;s a very good start).<br><br>So that&#39;s my advice, I guess. If you want to convince those who are willing to listen, you have to come to their table and meet them on their terms. If you claim there&#39;s a consensus, demonstrate it and be ready to counter any concerns they might have (e.g., the claim that the &quot;consensus&quot; is made up a large number of non-SME&#39;s with irrelevant doctorates, such as MDs. Strange as it may be, and wrong as this claim may be, I&#39;ve never seen it satisfactorily addressed by the other side).<br><br>Maybe I&#39;ve been talking to the wrong people or looking in the wrong places.

Some solutions (but definitely not all)<br><br>- Biofuel: Takes so much space to grow crops and doesn&#39;t output much energy in comparison to the need of energy, plus it takes away from space for growing food (even as we still have people starving) and also it doesn&#39;t reduce carbon emissions, only produces about equal to what they take in while growing.<br><br>- Nuclear fission: Very good output, takes ages to dispose of waste, thousands of years burying waste is not a very good idea. It has dangers of meltdown as has been shown and also is a target for those who wish to misuse them.<br><br>- Most &#39;renewable&#39; measures, like solar, wind, tide, geothermal etc: Don&#39;t provide much energy at all, to provide more it would need a lot of room, lot of cost, and to be honest sounds worse than sticking to coal, gas and oil. Many have limitations of availability of energy like hydroelectric, others need specific climates or sun availability, the list of downsides is almost endless.<br><br>Nuclear fusion: In my opinion is the best bet, the way forward and where i think i large amount of money needs to be invested, the ITER looks promising but is still in research phase and extremely expensive and hasn&#39;t of yet been able to provide more energy than it uses. The project at the NIF is also promising but isn&#39;t there yet and needs more research, needs more money and has a lot of cost. Doesn&#39;t produce much waste, produces helium and it uses sea water and makes so much energy. (Not accurate figures but if i recall from a documentary 1 gallon of water would make enough energy as 100,000 gallons of oil).<br><br>But the best would be a combination with my personal opinion of focussing primarily on fusion. But clearly this is debated and I hope my point has been made, the solution is far from clear. All I have said doesn&#39;t take into account of poorer nations, how would they cope with their current problems as well as trying to change to this new cleaner energy etc.<br><br>Oh, one other addition I wanted to mention, one other solution is &quot;reducing energy consumption&quot;, I agree little reduction to stop &#39;waste&#39; but overall the effect of stopping the waste of energy would be little. Crashcourse uploaded a video about energy and mentioned &quot;vast reductions of our energy usage would be a step back into the past&quot; which I agree with on the most part. Stopping waste like leaving lights on downstairs while you&#39;re asleep, but overall we need ever-growing amounts of energy for everything, reducing overall is not an option. Even less sustainable than sticking to coal, gas and oil.<br><br>The solution is far from clear. But the debate is needed and education is paramount.
