Urban legend has it that Le Verrier&#39;s calculation of the location of a planet perturbing the orbit of Uranus is bunk.  As they are, these calculations could never have found Neptune.  If you had the background to repeat them, you would see the validity of this statement.  The discovery of Neptune where Le Verrier thought it might be was a fortuitous ACCIDENT.  But urban legend has prevailed for more than 100 yrs because the laymen community wants it so.<br><br>Secondly, any numerical multibody calculations that are said to span 2B yrs and give accurate representations of Kuiper/planetary orbits is more than mere BS, it&#39;s BS^10.  Chaos will set in big time after around a few million simulation yrs.  That means there would be no predictability of any accuracy after that time span.  Also the numerical error propagation of roundoff and truncation will swamp the results later on around the 20 - 25M mark.  Your Cal Tech expert didnt address this...or know about this.  These long-term simulations use very rudimentary gravitational force laws that facilitate a rapid (approximate) calculation of the Newtonian inverse-square force law.  The result is a myriad of possible orbital configurations, but none of them could be pointed to as definitive.  After many simulations, trends could be spotted, but these could be numerical artifacts that consistently pop up because of the crude gravitational model used in the multibody calculations. <br><br>No reasonable prediction of the existence of a 9th planet will be found from these numerical simulations.  A 9th planet of 5 earth masses<br>interacting with billions of Kuiper bodies will have no influence that could ever be detected.  Detection could be possible with a Jupiter-sized body, but that would have been detected thru astronomical observations decades ago.

The point I am making is that there can be even more than one undiscovered planet. And then everything gets much more complicated concerning maths and orbits of Kuiper belt objects and the orbits of the not yet discovered planets 9, 10, \u2026 . So maybe the reason why planet 9 has not been discovered yet, might be that the search for planet 9 so far was made under the false assumption that there is no planet 10.

Can ye possibly bear witness that besides Allah there is another Allah?&quot; Say: &quot;Nay! I cannot bear witness!&quot; Say: &quot;But in truth He is the one Allah, and I truly am innocent of (your blasphemy of) joining others with Him.&quot;<br>20. Those to whom We have given the Book know this as they know their own sons. Those who have lost their own souls refuse therefore to believe.<br>21. Who doth more wrong than he who inventeth a lie against Allah or rejecteth His signs? But verily the wrong-doers never shall prosper.<br>22. One day shall We gather them all together: We shall say to those who ascribed partners (to Us): &quot;Where are the partners whom ye (invented and) talked about?&quot;<br>23. There will then be (left) no subterfuge for them but to say: &quot;By Allah our Lord, we were not those who joined gods with Allah.&quot;<br>24. Behold! how they lie against their own souls! But the (lie) which they invented will leave them in the lurch.<br>25. Of them there are some who (pretend to) listen to thee; but We have thrown veils on their hearts, So they understand it not, and deafness in their ears; if they saw every one of the signs, not they will believe in them; in so much that when they come to thee, they (but) dispute with thee; the Unbelievers say: &quot;These are nothing but tales of the ancients.&quot;<br>26. Others they keep away from it, and themselves they keep away; but they only destroy their own souls, and they perceive it not.<br>27. If thou couldst but see when they are confronted with the Fire! They will say: &quot;Would that we were but sent back! Then would we not reject the signs of our Lord, but would be amongst those who believe!&quot;<br>28. Yea, in their own (eyes) will become manifest what before they concealed. But if they were returned, they would certainly relapse to the things they were forbidden, for they are indeed liars.<br>29. And they (sometimes) say: &quot;There is nothing except our life on this earth, and never shall we be raised up again.&quot;<br>30. If thou couldst but see when they are confronted with their Lord! He will say: &quot;Is not this the truth?&quot; They will say: &quot;Yea, by our Lord!&quot; He will say: &quot;Taste ye then the penalty, because ye rejected Faith.&quot;<br>31. Lost indeed are they who treat it as a falsehood that they must meet Allah,- until on a sudden the hour is on them, and they say: &quot;Ah! woe unto us that we took no thought of it&quot;; for they bear their burdens on their backs, and evil indeed are the burdens that they bear?<br>32. What is the life of this world but play and amusement? But best is the home in the hereafter, for those who are righteous. Will ye not then understand?<br>33. We know indeed the grief which their words do cause thee: It is not thee they reject: it is the signs of Allah, which the wicked condemn.<br>34. Rejected were the messengers before thee: with patience and constancy they bore their rejection and their wrongs, until Our aid did reach them: there is none that can alter the words (and decrees) of Allah. Already hast thou received some account of those messengers.<br>35. If their spurning is hard on thy mind, yet if thou wert able to seek a tunnel in the ground or a ladder to the skies and bring them a sign,- (what good?). If it were Allah&#39;s will, He could gather them together unto true guidance: so be not thou amongst those who are swayed by ignorance (and impatience)!<br>36. Those who listen (in truth), be sure, will accept: as to the dead, Allah will raise them up; then will they be turned unto Him.<br>37. They say: &quot;Why is not a sign sent down to him from his Lord?&quot; Say: &quot;Allah hath certainly power to send down a sign: but most of them understand not.<br>38. There is not an animal (that lives) on the earth, nor a being that flies on its wings, but (forms part of) communities like you. Nothing have we omitted from the Book, and they (all) shall be gathered to their Lord in the end.<br>39. Those who reject our signs are deaf and dumb,- in the midst of darkness profound: whom Allah willeth, He leaveth to wander: whom He willeth, He placeth on the way that is straight.<br>40. Say: &quot;Think ye to yourselves, if there come upon you the wrath of Allah, or the Hour (that ye dread), would ye then call upon other than Allah?- (reply) if ye are truthful!<br>41. &quot;Nay,- On Him would ye call, and if it be His will, He would remove (the distress) which occasioned your call upon Him, and ye would forget (the false gods) which ye join with Him!&quot;<br>42. Before thee We sent (messengers) to many nations, and We afflicted the nations with suffering and adversity, that they might learn humility.<br>43. When the suffering reached them from us, why then did they not learn humility? On the contrary their hearts became hardened, and Satan made their (sinful) acts seem alluring to them.<br>44. But when they forgot the warning they had received, We opened to them the gates of all (good) things, until, in the midst of their enjoyment of Our gifts, on a sudden, We called them to account, when lo! they were plunged in despair!<br>45. Of the wrong-doers the last remnant was cut off. Praise be to Allah, the Cherisher of the worlds.<br>46. Say: &quot;Think ye, if Allah took away your hearing and your sight, and sealed up your hearts, who - a god other than Allah - could restore them to you?&quot; See how We explain the signs by various (symbols); yet they turn aside.<br>47. Say: &quot;Think ye, if the punishment of Allah comes to you, whether suddenly or openly, will any be destroyed except those who do wrong?<br>48. We send the messengers only to give good news and to warn: so those who believe and mend (their lives),- upon them shall be no fear, nor shall they grieve.<br>49. But those who reject our signs,- them shall punishment touch, for that they ceased not from transgressing.<br>50. Say: &quot;I tell you not that with me are the treasures of Allah, nor do I know what is hidden, nor do I tell you I am an angel. I but follow what is revealed to me.&quot; Say: &quot;can the blind be held equal to the seeing?&quot; Will ye then consider not?<br>51. Give this warning to those in whose (hearts) is the fear that they will be brought (to judgment) before their Lord: except for Him they will have no protector nor intercessor: that they may guard (against evil).<br>52. Send not away those who call on their Lord morning and evening, seeking His face. In naught art thou accountable for them, and in naught are they accountable for thee, that thou shouldst turn them away, and thus be (one) of the unjust.<br>53. Thus did We try some of them by comparison with others, that they should say: &quot;Is it these then that Allah hath favoured from amongst us?&quot; Doth not Allah know best those who are grateful?<br>54. When those come to thee who believe in Our signs, Say: &quot;Peace be on you: Your Lord hath inscribed for Himself (the rule of) mercy: verily, if any of you did evil in ignorance, and thereafter repented, and amend (his conduct), lo! He is Oft-forgiving, Most Merciful.<br>55. Thus do We explain the signs in detail: that the way of the sinners may be shown up.<br>56. Say: &quot;I am forbidden to worship those - others than Allah - whom ye call upon.&quot; Say: &quot;I will not follow your wain desires: If I did, I would stray from the path, and be not of the company of those who receive guidance.&quot;<br>57. Say: &quot;For me, I (work) on a clear sign from my Lord, but ye reject Him. What ye would see hastened, is not in my power. The command rests with none but Allah: He declares the truth, and He is the best of judges.&quot;<br>58. Say: &quot;If what ye would see hastened were in my power, the matter would be settled at once between you and me. But Allah knoweth best those who do wrong.&quot;<br>59. With Him are the keys of the unseen, the treasures that none knoweth but He. He knoweth whatever there is on the earth and in the sea. Not a leaf doth fall but with His knowledge: there is not a grain in the darkness (or depths) of the earth, nor anything fresh or dry (green or withered), but is (inscribed) in a record clear (to those who can read).<br>60. It is He who doth take your souls by night, and hath knowledge of all that ye have done by day: by day doth He raise you up again; that a term appointed be fulfilled; In the end unto Him will be your return; then will He show you the truth of all that ye did.<br>61. He is the irresistible, (watching) from above over His worshippers, and He sets guardians over you. At length, when death approaches one of you, Our angels take his soul, and they never fail in their duty.<br>.", "comment_date": "2022-07-01T21:39:55Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "ThePinkBinks", "comment_text": "Plot twist: we\u2019re a trinary system.", "comment_date": "2022-07-01T06:10:36Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Dave", "comment_text": "Name: Nibiru", "comment_date": "2022-06-30T18:02:40Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Stanley Maximillian", "comment_text": "I only know that (girls) planet 999 exists \ud83d\ude06", "comment_date": "2022-06-27T22:26:57Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "honjiraa honjiraa", "comment_text": "I can&#39;t believe he took the fun out of saying uranus.

They are only close enough to have had the potential to have been seen in this brief time by this new humanity in a small sliver of their orbits near their perihelions.  We would not have seen Sedna if it had been somewhere else in its orbit when humans invented telescopes and started looking way past Neptune.

Its true a mysterious amount of mass in our solar system is affecting other planets, comets, &amp; asteroids.  People say that due to its calculated mass it has to be planet. But they are wrong. You see it goes back to when our Solar System was formed. What caused all the concretion that formed all our planets moons and sun is dark matter that is sloughed off black holes when they eat too much. You see when a sun or planet crosses the event horizon it is converted to dark matter aka black hole matter. As the Black Hole eats it reach a tipping point where it cannot absorb and hold on to all the newly made black hole material. The result is that it is shot out the poles of the black hole at 83% the speed of life. Remeber just a teaspoon of black hole material is suppose to weigh thousands of long tons. So when it finally slows down and starts absorbing material to form suns moons and planets. Some times like in our case this dark matter/black hole material ends up in a place in space where it plays a tug of war against other planets and objects. Soon it becomes stagnant and the reason why we cannot see it is because it is.......Dark Matter aka Black Hole material.", "comment_date": "2021-12-05T00:47:34Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Gator", "comment_text": "I&#39;m curious,  without going through years of comments,  why can&#39;t the hubble telescope ( or any other space based telescope) be used in place of ground base observations, to try to find this obscure planet?

Just because we haven\u2019t been able to find too many smaller mass exoplanets doesn\u2019t mean they don\u2019t exist; it could mean that they are much more difficult to discover, given the limits of our current technology. <br><br>Bear in mind, we have yet to directly observe any exoplanets. Any luminosity they have is just overwhelmed by the luminosity of their star(s). We infer their existence by observing the stars behavior \u2014 using two methods. <br><br>First, we observe the slight wobbles in the star\u2019s motion, which are the result of the gravitational tug of planets. Obviously large planets are going to cause larger wobbles. Second, we measure very carefully any periodic dimming of the star\u2019s luminosity, which could be caused b a transit of an orbiting planet. This method only works if the stellar system is in the right alignment with regard to Earth, so that rules out a lot of stars. Also, larger planets are going to cause a larger dimming of the luminosity of the star in question than smaller planets are. <br><br>So both methods tend to discover larger exoplanets. It\u2019s actually remarkable that we are able to detect exoplanets at all. But we must be very careful about generalizing the structures of these stellar systems, based on our limited ability to detect exoplanets. Yes, it can appear that planets 5 times the mass of Earth may SEEM to be the norm, but that could simply be that given our current technology, it\u2019s FAR more difficult to detect planets smaller than 5 times the mass of Earth. Such planets would be far more difficult to detect. But we shouldn\u2019t, given our very limited data, conclude that small, Earth mass, or smaller planets are therefore much more rare.

All you have to do, (using basic star tracking technology) is determine the alignments of 4 of our orbiting bodies, 1,692 years from now, which will be the year 3712.  By fast forwarding your tracking to this timeline, you will see a planetary alignment never before realized and will look like this, Earth, the Sun, Mercury and Pluto all in a line. The purpose of this alignment is as follows, Mercury&#39;s position will be opposite to  the suns Barry center and will explode into our binary sun. Pluto&#39;s orbit will be in close enough proximity to become ignited by the Mercury explosion. And of course this will all take place on the opposite, (or outer) side of the Sun, thus shielding our Earth from damage. Once Pluto is engulfed in flames, the fiery orb will pass through nebula crystals, which will adhere to it without extinguishing it. The end result will be Pluto cloaked in gasses with it&#39;s size and mass equal to Neptune, the &quot;great blue spot&quot; is simply the burning orb within, creating a funnel type vortex on the surface, thus giving us Planet 9.  Aside from all of that, this means that with only 1,692 years before our binary sun period begins, we may have less time ahead of us than the history of our current society. I am the only individual on Earth to have figured all of this out, and as crazy as it may sound, I have created some video demonstrations to help you visualize how our solar system really works, including a looping animation of our solar system, sped up to over 26,000 years per second, to give you a proper perspective of our solar system.", "comment_date": "2021-05-17T01:18:34Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "J", "comment_text": "Hey, so um, what if this lead to the &#39;one way direction of light&#39; video", "comment_date": "2021-05-16T06:01:37Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Matt Hilbert", "comment_text": "&quot;Can I go to the bathroom?&quot;<br>&quot;That&#39;s a great question&quot;", "comment_date": "2021-05-15T03:41:39Z", "likes_count": 4683}, {"comment_by": "Leocram Vinci", "comment_text": "Please don&#39;t call it David Bowie", "comment_date": "2021-05-13T13:45:57Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Truthteam10", "comment_text": "It&#39;s name is Nibiru , not david bowie", "comment_date": "2021-05-13T03:44:59Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Ondrej Sova", "comment_text": "Oh, this doesn&#39;t count Pluto.

The Global Elite always tell us the truth in plain sight, but in a way that hides it.\r Planet 9 is real, but not in the sense that it is being presented to us. \r<br>\r<br>I was led to the understanding that the earth is a globe (similar to a toy snow globe) , with a flat plane of existence, described in the Bible as a circle, underneath a molten glass firmament. The Lord also showed me that the earth is actually part of binary twin system,  described in Revelation 12 as the Red Dragon, or planet x and what the ancient Sumerians called Nibiru, which means &quot;Planet of the Crossing&quot;, that He is going to use to bring judgement on the world.  And these two worlds are separated by a Vortex or what Scientists call a Black Hole and what the band Sound Garden\u2019s song: \u201cBlack Hole Sun\u201d is all about. \r<br>\r<br>Magnetism is what gives birth to space and counter-space, which forms the conjugate geometry of the universe and the plain of existence or the plain of inertia, is where all time and life exist. There is no space beyond the firmament, only &quot;universal waters&quot; and endless clean energy through cold fusion, where the Lord God spoke everything into existence through vibrational frequency. Do you get it, \u201cSound Garden\u201d?? Back Hole Sun?? The Truth is always in plain sight, just like the \u201cRed Hot Chili Pepper\u201d lyrics, \u201cSpace may be the final frontier, but it\u2019s made in a Hollywood basement\u201d. And although we live within a globe, the surface of the earth is more or less flat.  Isn\u2019t this what Nikola Tesla advocated, \u201cIf we want to understand the mysteries of the universe, we have to think in terms of vibrational frequency and energy. Where do think energy comes from in the dark vacuum of space? What form of matter does frequency interact with to create an abundant source of energy. Does it just appear out of nowhere? That&#39;s not how physics work! \r<br>\r<br>So the Elite are using these Caltech students like they did in the 1980s to once again softly disclose that this system exists, so that when this system starts to impact the earth, which we ae already seeing, they can say we couldn\u2019t see it, because it was hidden within this vortex or black hole, which can only be seen through infrared. You know like the Jesuit Vatican Infrared Telescope called Lucifer on top of Mt Graham in Az. Are you starting to see what the Lord is revealing to us in these end days? Because Jesus said in Luke <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pe83T9hISoY&amp;t=8m17s\">8:17</a> \u201cNothing that is secrete will not be revealed and nothing that is hidden in the dark will not be brought to light and made manifest\u201d.\r<br>\r<br>I have created a video that includes how we are being mocked in plain sight and that explains how the \u201cFlat plain of existence of earth\u201d or what others call the flat earth, coincides with night and day and the four seasons. I also provide a segment of NASA documents that explain how research on radar systems are based on a Non-rotating Flat Earth and also why there is a 52 country Antarctic treaty that prevent us from ever getting to close to the ice wall in my video,  \u201cThe Firmament Above\u201d.  <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=104nvVZjXrI&amp;t=2440s\">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=104nvVZjXrI&amp;t=2440s\r</a><br>\r<br>Then watch my video titled \u201cUs &amp; Them Part 2\u201d, which explains how I was led to this information about Earth Binary Twin Systems. You can choose to watch it or not, that\u2019s entirely up to you. But keep in mind that this information was revealed to by the Holy spirit, not myself. But I do hope that you receive it.  <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qIQTno7iGBQ&amp;t=179s\">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qIQTno7iGBQ&amp;t=179s</a>", "comment_date": "2020-11-16T17:24:35Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Jonas Kronborg", "comment_text": "Space is fake.", "comment_date": "2020-11-16T15:16:59Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "RetroTechToybox", "comment_text": "We already have a Planet 9.

From the <br>P2 red giant star Betelgeuse, will be it&#39;s gravity waves, as it went supernova 671.2 years ago. It&#39;s <br>older than earth which is 5 billion years. The asteroid called Hercolubus, or Apophis known also <br>in ancient Egypt as the &quot;destroyer&quot; and found on the pyramids, will cause it&#39;s ( debris field to drop <br>chunks on to earth. ) Apophis is actually 3 X the size of what hit killing the dinosaurs, but merely a <br>ONE % CHANCE OF A HIT. This combination will destroy many areas, chuncks into the ocean etc...<br> and trigger the pole shift. <br>(The asteroid is expected April 19 2029.) The public will see this in the sky by late 2025. NOBODY <br>WILL TELL THE PUBLIC THE TRUTH. Do I care if you don&#39;t believe it ?  NO,..  You&#39;ll be seeing it.<br><br>Both LIGO and VIRGO observatories separated by 3,000 miles, are laser interferometer gravitational<br>waves observatories. The general public has not been given their discovery of the Betelgeuse star<br>that went supernova 671.2 years ago, on the evening news ! The globalists that know what it means<br>don&#39;t want the public to understand the big picture as to the long cycles of destruction and renewal.<br>This event is the reason all that is being done on the earth now, is by the globalists that already know <br>about this. Now being 2020, you will see many famous people being DISCREDITED, and many going <br>to prison.<br>The Betelgeuse Gravity waves release nascent hydrogen and oxygen in ringwoodite, 420 to 640 <br>miles beneath us, turning it into water, which lowers the melting point of rock to create magma, <br>causing earthquakes and volcanic activity. Include Apophis, and you experience tsunami&#39;s on the <br>coasts moving some 500 miles an hour going inland up to 100 miles at sea level. Imagine a tsunami <br>one mile high. That&#39;s over 5,000 feet ! <br>Some 80% of populations live too close to the coast.  The combination of the asteroid and gravity waves <br>will cause the pole shift once the crust reaches the piezoelectric slip threshold. How? Glad you asked.<br><br>There is enough water in this form, to be some 10 X the amount on the surface and in the atmosphere. <br>Before the last crustal  pole shift, south Baffiin Island was the north pole, and Atlantis was moved from <br>what is now the southern tip of S America, to the Antarctic where it is to this day ! Obvious researchers <br>using videos have no idea where it is.<br>The crustal shift will as an example, move to place Havana Cuba on the equator, at the speed of a senior <br>citizen using a walker. A portion of earth exposed to space radiation for lack of the ozone layer in the <br>region of the middle east ( it is on a trajectory to the southern hemisphere), will not be able to go outside, <br>nor drink the water as it will be poisoned, and will see the destroyed vegetation and animals.<br><br>Readers just may recall the events that happened in Egypt, when Israel left ! That stuff is all in scriptures, <br>but people don&#39;t understand what the meanings are nor how this will effect OUR LAST GENERATION <br>of secular history, nor that a remnant shall be saved nor how to be one of the remnant. There&#39;s very few <br>to do the teaching and people will die for lack of knowledge. <br><br>Millions will take the vaccine that will forever change their DNA and can not be reversed. Use the <br>LEO satellites, they want to dial up your cortex using frequency as applied to psycoenergetics. It&#39;s the <br>5 and 6 G that is deadly to cause a variety of disease conditions. This subject alone requires in-depth <br>study, and is connected to the geoengineering. What researchers are exposing, is the pope&#39;s UN Agenda<br>21/2030, and the globalists plans many call conspiracy theories. Try a well documented site triple W<br>stop the crime dot net ! For covid 19 and others to come, get the solution from triple W nutrimedical dot <br>com the First line of defence kit. That, took 50 years of post doctoral research, and the so called medical<br>authorities don&#39;t want that out.<br><br>The planet Alpha Draconis, use to have life on it 671.2 years ago. Perhaps you read what some call just <br>conspiracy theories, about the Drako Reptillians? Well guess what? The Pope doesn&#39;t wear a damn fish <br>hat because he represents G-d. He serves evil. Hell of a durprise to 1.2 billion Catholics. I know. I grew up <br>with it. Can you guess the reason why the black plague starting around 1348 till 1665 took place killing <br>50% of earth&#39;s population as their planet was destroyed? <br><br>Did you know the Giza pyramids are in alignment with that region in the belt of Orion, Sirus A and Sirus B.<br>and beneath these is the largest maze of underground caverns and tunnels on earth. That&#39;s not public in<br>the open source information anywhere. We have been warned by leaders like Dwight Eisenhower and <br>John Kennedy, The statements at the retirement party of an outgoing CEO of Lockheed Martin already<br>let it out, they have the ability to take ET home. The technologies are extreme but that&#39;s another subject.<br><br>Notice Trump got financing for the space force. The symbol is the same as Star Trek ! Trump is a builder. <br>He knows the secrets of the globalists and they can&#39;t control him. His masonic name, is Apollyon Rising. <br>He&#39;s a white Knight of the Scottish Rite. His NY City apartment has the Apollo theme. The fact is, the <br>highest levels of masons know the name of the former king of Mars was Apollo, and the loss of it&#39;s <br>atmosphere is again a whole other study. So after the pole shift, the globalists want the USA to be the new <br>Atlantis. THIS WILL NOT HAPPEN.

A star is an omnidirectional emitter of coherent electromagnetic waves! In essence, we see a pillar of a ray of light! Everything is very simple! We see stars only because our Sun in our galaxy flies in sync with the rest of the stars! The distance between the stars is increasing, but it is so very - a slow process that lasts for millions of years. That is, an astronomer cannot observe the change in such long processes, since Earth time flies by with lightning speed! And so, now we know that distant stars are statically attached to one coordinate point in the sky, but why does the light of the stars travels so long distances, reaching our optic nerve?\r 8558<br>It&#39;s all about COHERENCE! The emitted light of the stars forms a kind of laser beam of light, in one of the radiation spectra such as X-rays this radiation is most effective. The rotation of the stars around their axis further enhances the coherence by pumping the beam. In fact, we see a column of a ray of light, but we see only that beam-column that flies in our direction, forming a peak - an energy point. In neighboring solar systems, people observe the phase radiation of the beam but several degrees to the side. The formed point in the sky confirms that the star is exactly in the place of its coordinates! if the Star could move relative to our Sun, then no coherent ray would be able to form.\r<br>  <a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/125896111@N07/50431730627/in/dateposted-public/\">https://www.flickr.com/photos/125896111@N07/50431730627/in/dateposted-public/</a>", "comment_date": "2020-10-07T13:55:43Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "FISH ON", "comment_text": "Attention kids!

They drew all the planets in our system, including Nibiru. They new about Pluto &amp; drew it, but we didn&#39;t actually see it until the 1940&#39;s, yet the Sumerians new about it thousands of years ago. The Sumerians drew the orbits of all the planets using a straight line for their regular orbits, then they also drew dotted lines showing how Nibiru pushes all the planets out of their normal orbits when it comes in to the inner solar system. Just a couple of years ago scientists stated that something is pushing the other planets out of their normal orbits but they don&#39;t know what it is that is causing it. The K - 12 schools teach, or used too, that the Sumerians are the oldest civilization on earth &amp; that they created the &quot;Baghdad Battery&quot;, but nothing else. Colleges don&#39;t teach a damn thing about the Sumerians, why? Lately people have been attacking the Sumerians, making false info video&#39;s about what they said in their cuneiform texts, these videos say things like &quot;life began 7 levels down in the ground&quot;, (satanic worship), as opposed to 7 Heaven? They attackers also make videos saying &quot;back when men had intimate relations with animals, (again this is Satanic worship), why would they attack the Sumerians like this if what they said is not true?? The Ancient Sumerians told of 2 passings of Nibiru, 1 in which it passed by the outside of earth &amp; the sun which caused very little disturbances on earth, then the 1 where it crossed between the sun &amp; earth which caused all the volcano&#39;s to erupt at once, huge earthquakes the magnitude of which had never been seen before, space rocks falling like hail stones, large space rocks hitting the ocean&#39;s which caused Noah&#39;s Flood, &amp; it wiped out about 2/3rds of the population. So again, why is it that no schools teach about this stuff, including colleges? Why are people attacking what the Sumerians recorded in their cuneiform texts?

You can add more tracks and make the track longer or take some away to make it shorter. But if you left it together and did not use it for a while you would notice a dust trail on the track. If you look in the sky and look for dust trails that seem to be in a gravitational lock, you would be able to see the rings that planets travel on. If you&#39;re able to see these you can pinpoint the orbits of all planetary bodies. Space is very dusty, all kinds of particles and space trash that get caught by these orbits. If you are able to track one or more and find a more expanded orbit around the sun you could possibly find planet 9 by this method. See I always thought planet 9 orbited around the sun every 3600 years. I use astronomy, astrophysics, and a few others in my field. I am studying to be an anthropologist and if you look back and the Anunaki text they talk a lot about the 9th planet and in there text they states it comes around every 3600 years, around the same time floods and ice ages happen. They state that it is the reason for it because of its gravitational pull on the planets. But in their texts, it also talks about other planets being out there as well. So I would check the texts from Enki and Enil. They also talk about the locations of these planets. You know we can use info from other fields. I use as many as needed to find out answers. Also your right, you cant find something looking in one direction. we have a 360-degree view, we have to look at all areas.

I believe they called this planet Nibiru, or something? I don&#39;t know much about it, other than that they for some reason believed it would cause some sort of godly catastrophe for Earth. Personally I don&#39;t believe we were visited by aliens or anything like that. However, I do believe we once used to have a really sophisticated and technological society here on Earth that may have even matched ours today. After all, there are very old stories that describe both the explosion of nuclear weapons and the radiation sickness following it afterwards creepily accurately. And don&#39;t forget about the massive catastrophic flood that occurred thousands of years ago described by pretty much every single culture that ever lived. But I won&#39;t go down that rabid hole right now. I do conclude one thing from it all, though: we cannot deny that our ancient ancestors had knowledge that they weren&#39;t &#39;supposed&#39; to have. And a lot of that knowledge has disappeared throughout the years, sadly.

It just gets too close to the earth and causes havoc. It&#39;s okay though: it&#39;s only random passings that cause local extinction events on earth. Sometimes, it can be assumed, that it simply causes a few earthquakes and some widespread volcanic activity, changing the atmosphere and ultimately causing great freezes, mini ice-ages, or even larger, 100 thousand year ice ages.Or even scorching the surface of the earth, and then freezing it for a while. The idea of a sedentary, calm universe has lost it&#39;s momentum. We all know that advanced technological civilizations have come and gone for millions if not billions of years here on earth, and yes, I&#39;m referring to Homo sapiens. Cataclysms come, and we almost die out, but we always bounce back. Humans are hardy. But back to planet 9: this used to be the 10th planet of Sitchen&#39;s when he translated the Sumerian tablets. Of course it is. Planet 9, planet 10, Nibiru, Planet X...call it boo if you want. But it&#39;s real. of course. To question whether it exists or not is ludicrous. There is too much spoken of the planet in antiquity. Duh. It exists. Better to figure out when it&#39;s gonna get here, and are we really going to allow any of the global-elite, petro-d0llar greed and power mongers a hiding place? Amongst us? in hiding? Do they deserve it, after their trashing of both the earth and humanity for the last 100 years or so? With their treatment of humanity? They&#39;ve systematically taken control. Not even the president of the US is allowed clearance to their shenanigans... So let me ask you, does that sound right?  Think about it.They&#39;ve stolen the country away from the people, we now live in a military state. But now, with the global economy being shaken to the very core of the petro dollar, which is fiat money and doesn&#39;t exist as far as being backed by gold, or diamonds or whatever is valuable at the time. Let&#39;s dump the fossil-fuel rulers that have kept us their slaves, let&#39;s start using the free electricty and power sources that Tesla and others purported. We can heal the earth, but the old ways have to die. We can heal the earth in the next 100 years, and no one will live in poverty anymore, the world will be a very beautiful place indeed to live, because with no dependence of fossil fuels, agriculture and ranching can be done locally, in even the most harsh areas because the energy needed is free!!

In about 25 years. <br><br>The Myans had it right. Just the discovery was never made public when the truth would have had a chance to bring about the end. As war and unrest was sure to erupt then. As it is we are living in a blisfull ignorance.  But ignorance is not making anyone ready for whats coming. We are not alone.

Something that in death that can seek out its new clone and live again. <br><br>But that is only what is planned. There are more places to go than to being an alien. Just nothing said now can change the outcome of what peoples choices have aready done to them. <br><br>Aliens could only ever put their spirit here. In the form of the human vessel.

They needed to flee an impending disaster or something. Also, it would explain why the UFOs we see are not very large They are just run-about&#39;s. If there were an alien generation ships that came here and their biology is just not quite right to live in our atmosphere, that would explain a need to gather human and animal specimens; to do bio engineering.  They could even be aquatic.  In addition the location of the orbit is perfect for a incoming giant ship to slow down. A few other possible thoughts is it is a black hole in Dyson sphere or even a worm hole end point ( I like this one too). There is just starting to be to many real sightings lately.

Why isn&#39;t gravity from Neptune and Uranus pulling Kuiper belt asteroids into the outer solar system and generally destabilizing it? The reason that the asteroids in the asteroid belt are in such stable orbits and not flying all over the solar system is because the gravitational pull of Jupiter stabilizes their orbits and regulates the entire asteroid belt. I&#39;m probably wrong about this but I think something must be out there regulating the orbits of the Kuiper Belt Objects. In addition to that giving the trans neptunian objects their wonky elliptical orbits, it doesn&#39;t make any sense for them to have those orbits naturally, however that doesn&#39;t really count because they could have been moons of the gas giants at one point and then got flung out into the outer solar system settling into their current weird orbits", "comment_date": "2019-09-23T01:28:53Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Axel Flambert", "comment_text": "hello I am one of the more stupid viewers, is there a channel that makes it easier to understand.", "comment_date": "2019-09-23T01:27:35Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "ReignSpider", "comment_text": "they should call it planet Freddy Mercury", "comment_date": "2019-09-23T01:20:59Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "LORDMETAL1", "comment_text": "I love it when these a*<b>***</b> start drawing on chalkboards makes them feel so much cooler", "comment_date": "2019-09-23T01:06:20Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "J.

They described a meteorite name Almahata Sitta which, when fragments were opened, were found to contain diamonds larger than anyone expected.

I left the following tongue-in-cheek comment:<br><br>&quot;I know. Almahata Sitta is a remnant of Planet 9. The reason we can&#39;t find planet 9 is that it was destroyed in a collision but its gravitational effects remain until something equally big rolls through the Kuiper Belt and rearranges things again.

More than that. There can be transtellar planets that orbit the Sun and other neighboring stars. More than that. There can be intertranstellar planets that add and subtract the stars in cycles as they orbit them, making a few orbits around one star and other stars to every so many cycles add and drop the stars they orbit and then to return to the original group of stars they orbited.

Hell they could of built a secondary artificial planet, Updated 2.0 type and destroy another planet in that system just so they can connect after so many thousands of year, expanding humanity or human like beings.

That&#39;s a fantasy and there is no proof but there is a possibility that&#39;s how it happen and everything in the BIBLE, Torah and Koran already happen some millions of years ago and the reason we hold on to it because they wanted us to believe in something greater than our dumb ass selves. I know this sounds far fetched but there are archaeological proof, Stories of a planet that existed between Jupiter and Mars and it was called Tiamat, 5 headed dragon probably A planet that had 4 moons. Tiamat Was slain by? and there you have your Artificial Planet. Do not discount our religions, stories and history, and then there is the obvious question, What would we do as a whole planet if we faced World wide annihilation from the Solar flares? One swinging arm can cook and fry our planet and all life on earth will become extinct. So what preparations would we conduct? Build stone monuments that can withstand the test of time so we can warn the next civilization of the pending doom?  Setup Vaults in a mountain that contains every plant, herb, tree , grass seeds in existence or and every living creatures DNA on earth? We would travel to Mars and setup shop, We would also travel to Jupiter&#39;s moons and setup there as well so if a solar flare does hit Humanity will survive on other planets while earth is biologically destroyed... Now do not be alarmed, it is mother nature to cook our planet because it will only grow back again in another few million years...

Astronomers attempt to keep the number of planets down to an amount the public can remember is just silly.

We have seen in stellar nurseries stars form closer than some types of binaries that are not tidally locked. The legit theory of Nemesis is that Nemesis formed close to Sol, but was not tidally locked. But as Sol and Nemesis went their separate ways, Nemesis yanked our planetary system into its current configuration and either ejected or captured Sol&#39;s super Earth.

I find it interesting that Professor Jewitt was discussing biases and how they would lead those who believe there is a &quot;planet 9&quot; to see evidence for it where there is none; however, I also think that the reverse is true - that newer data is sometimes ignored because it conflicts with what scientists believed in past decades based on the data gathered at that time, which would now have to be acknowledged as being incomplete.
