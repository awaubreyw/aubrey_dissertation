Of course that&#39;s another surprising thing too as those colors were the basics of the only colors people would primarily see. Red White Black and Yellow. <br><br>I think color is also very interesting how we seem to have evolved to perceive different colors as well. I know color is through a lens of light and it&#39;s how it gets perceived but I&#39;d say it&#39;s actually interesting as well how color has evolved with us. As an example most ancient civilizations didn&#39;t have a blue asides the ancient Egyptians who successfully made the first blue dye so to most most ancient civilizations the color wasn&#39;t perceived and didn&#39;t exist. Also when you hear how people didn&#39;t dream in color until color tv well this because movies started out in black in white and the era of black and white movies and television people would also have dreams in black in white likely influenced by their movies. Maybe it&#39;s because these are or are not colors people associated with at their times. As different groups of Indigenous people the colors often we&#39;ll have representations to are red white black and yellow mostly and you&#39;ll see these in our art quite a bit. Homer in ancient times would describe honey as green and the sky as violet.

I have one idea. Nerve impulses are basically frequency modulated pulse streams. They form small currents which are changing with time and therefore self inductance can effect the magnitude of this current and thus whether target neurons activate or not. The nerves in effect become the moving coils of a motor. i.e. the nerves are displaced small amounts absorbing energy from the electrical currents.<br><br>The problem with this theory is that typical bandwidth of individual neuronal  firing is 200 to 300 Hz and given that neuronal axons are measured in micrometers the inductance of the signal paths would be extremely small,  the loading due to a week magnetic field like earths would be minuscule.  Thus the force generated by the interaction of the neuronal magnetic field would also be minuscule, so why can we detect it?<br><br>Also if this were the mechanism you would expect much higher response from artificial magnets with fields 1000 times greater. Is this the case?  I think not or we would go bananas as all our nerve impulses would be attenuated, and if we moved our heads rapidly we might electrocute our brains.<br><br>Ohh! I just saw the paper, but I was correct electro-magnetic induction is too weak.  So its a quantum effect; exact mechanism unknown.<br><br>Any way I reckon it&#39;s just a residual capability in humans, left over from our past.

But I could be wrong about this.<br><br>On the question of conscious awareness: It&#39;s a bit like walking along a footpath, you aren&#39;t conscious of navigating, it&#39;s not a cognitive process you just do it.  The magnetic thing is likely to be the same.<br><br>Anyway what about the hippocampus which has a lot to do with spatial memory and location.

Arabic doesn&#39;t have words for left and right, well originally didn&#39;t I should say, but the terms for north and south eventually just became the words for left and right. In fact, the Hebrew words for left and right are directly related to the Arabic words for north and south.

It&#39;s absolutely possible that there are other, faster mechanisms to gain and lose genetic traits. But my point remains that on a genetic level we can not have lost this trait within a couple of decades. It seems far more likely to me that we stopped using it instead and thus are not trained to listen to it just like non-musicians say they can&#39;t hear if someone&#39;s singing too high or too low (relative to a set pitch of a song for example), up to a certain point. They hear the same acoustic signal as a musician next to them, through equally capable sensory organs. They just haven&#39;t adjusted to distinguishing one sensation from another. I think that&#39;s very comparable to how we can&#39;t reliably sense the difference between North and East. There&#39;s also the amazing phenomenon of perfect pitch which contrary to many opinions I have experienced to be learnable. You can remember what a colour looks like and reproduce or compare it to other colours, and learn to distinguish colours more and more accurately. The same can be done with frequencies of sounds. If you ask me to remember a song I&#39;ve heard many times before (but not recently), I will hear it in my head in the original key and can sing it for you in that key. For most songs I can&#39;t. It&#39;s about &quot;recording&quot; and remembering a sensation accurately because you have been consciously exposed to it many times, like a building you know in great detail only after many impressions where you focused on details. If that ability exists in humans, it must be nurtured in the same way in order to consciously be able to sense the &quot;feeling&quot; of a certain direction and compare it to previous sensations to be able to tell which is which.", "comment_date": "2022-05-12T23:59:08Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "MINETUBE QUEST", "comment_text": "People can also detect orientation by the liquids in their ears.", "comment_date": "2022-05-09T14:32:59Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Idk", "comment_text": "I feel like this isn\u2019t the best setup, but, it should work and give an accurate result.

Then, I was watching a video by Sadhaguru, and he happened to mention this phenomenon.  He said the solution was to sleep with your head facing the south.  He said that it had to do with strong magnetic pull.  So, I started sleeping with my head at the foot of the bed.  Problem solved.  No more vertigo.  I have a heavy sleigh bed that would be difficult to move and would look silly with the head of the bed in the middle of the room, so I just keep it as is and sleep with my head at the foot of the bed.  What&#39;s the next question for me is why I started having this problem and why do some people have a faint response all the way to a strong response?  Is it something nutritional?

Some people have more bits of it in their cells, than others.  This is also true with other creatures. <br>Also, most creatures on earth have iron, which is attracted to magnets; but our body iron mostly moves around in the blood, for instance, or inside muscles that move..maybe that fine-tunes directionality?? <br>So, yes, these tiny components interact with magnetic field in the environment. It can be used to migrate accurately. <br>Those who still have more of the cellular magnetite, will sense it more easily. <br>The more one can quiet the mind, &amp; observe the phenomenon, practice at it, it gets easier to use it. <br>And, it might indicate that having more usable amounts of cellular magnetite is a feature that has been lost over time from selective mutations by populations ceasing to seasonally migrate. <br>That fairly few can use it now, might also be related to how our world has become overwhelmingly flooded with \u201celectrosmog\u201d of various kinds, which \u201cyell louder\u201d than the cellular magnetite signals. <br>But we also rely on learned visual cues to find our way, so, one must get good with directions, landscape &amp; sky clues, &amp; auditory &amp; other cues. Together, with practice &amp; focus, more humans could still become pretty good at migrating along magnetic pathways. <br>And yes, there have been studies proving that various electrosmog sources DO disrupt mammalian body electrical signals &amp; body processes using electromagnetic signaling. That means, the stronger the electrosmog is, where people spend most time, the more chronically ill &amp; sudden unexpected deaths happen.\u00a0<br> It is especially physically damaging to immature (children\u2019s) brains; heavy electrosmog literally changes structures in the brains of children &amp; youth, permanently changing/impairing them for the rest of their lives.

Thank you. I learnt and confirmed many new aspects to my own research. Thank you. Again this is highly connected to the use of specific language and words which are words that encourage or boost feelings and experience of things. This topic was discussed by Gregg Braden and he explains the difference your brain experiences between how you express your perception. For example: If you say - &quot;look at that wave&quot; compared to &quot;see the water waving&quot;. The first description is stagnant with a STILL none moving wave. The second description is much more elicit in that you almost visualise/see waves moving and hear the sound of the water. Connecting this to the VIDEO . . . .  you can see the difference between using the words north, south compared to front and back. The words North and South push you into feeling and sensing that outer world and give you a perception of zooming out to visualise the earth as a whole. Rather than just be limited to what is in front of you and behind you. It makes you more connected to your surroundings.", "comment_date": "2021-07-17T15:31:55Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Blender 3D Tutorials von blenderHilfe.de", "comment_text": "real nice dog, thx for that :D", "comment_date": "2021-07-16T18:39:47Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Craig Scott", "comment_text": "Answer to heading, with the hair of the temples long, i believe so.", "comment_date": "2021-07-15T15:05:00Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Siddhu", "comment_text": "Who named the magnetic poles<br>As south and north?<br>Do you know?", "comment_date": "2021-07-15T14:49:45Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "onno de haas", "comment_text": "Nice video , minor point , why did you introduce the principle author afther the non principal author, would it be because she is female?", "comment_date": "2021-07-15T05:35:23Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Soul Mechanics", "comment_text": "Yes, you can bring this sense up to the conscious level of perception and strengthen it via meditative practices and certain substances.

I especially find the behavior of complex organisms with little or not DNA differentiation - such as siphonophores and man-of-wars and mycelium networks - very interesting. These have absolutely identical cells that form colonies. The cell&#39;s behavior is not differentiated by DNA, or neurons, but only their position within the colony. Personally I think that consciousness might be an emergent property of complex systems, perhaps including social networks. I&#39;m not sure and there would need to be much more research of course, but not everything originates from the brain actually, obviously, as the brain has to evolve and grow from a preexisting biological process to begin with. How and why cell division and life happen is basically to increase entropy and likely because of an ancient emulsion in the ocean, but exactly what consciousness is and what makes something &#39;truly conscious&#39; or not is going to be a very interesting frontier of science, especially as we see AI advance.

If you have the physical ability, it can be trained. One group of people who may know it far better than us, will be Blind people as it is my hypothesis that they use it as one of their many tools other than sight for navigation. <br><br>I myself am sensitive to cardinal directions and magnetism, electricity etc. I have done a lot of traveling by plane long distances which required sleep (US to China to UK) the outcome is, when I land at an airport I instinctively know which direction is north and south even in an area where I have no knowledge of the local map. If I were to merely focus on this ability much like focusing on hearing, I could maybe detect if there are large objects/walls in that direction, even if I could not see or hear anything. It can be used to &quot;sense&quot; how deep you are inside a building as well and also how solid the walls are, so going underground has this solid feeling. in other words it can be used to get a vague picture of your surroundings before you can see or hear. Using it in fast reflex to detect small objects or fast objects I.E. a bullet, probably isn&#39;t going to work on the first go. You would have to become used to the stimulus, that is the presence of such a small fast object. So unless somehow you block out sight and hearing and constantly have someone firing a gun on the other side of a wall you will probably not be able to have any reaction. and even with exposure it&#39;s doubt-able that your reaction if any would be quick enough. You would however be able to sense a change in wall density occupied by a person on the other side of the wall so if you were expecting to be shot at you could at least sense when they were lining up to make said shot.<br><br>are there times when I get confused? oddly enough, yes sometimes I get a spinning feeling if I&#39;m near a magnetic anomaly, that&#39;s disorienting.

Did Joe kill his first wife &amp; daughter???<br><br>Just released: <br>Copy n Paste<br>Joe Biden and his first wife, Neilia, had three children: Hunter, Beau and Naomi. <br><br>In 1972, Neilia and Naomi, died in a car accident. Joe eventually married a woman named Jill (his current wife). <br><br>He already knew Jill because she had been Hunter&#39;s babysitter at the time of the car accident &amp; Jill&#39;s then husband was a friend of Joe&#39;s. (Yeah, THAT seems normal- marry the babysitter &amp; wife of a friend - Forensic Files). They had a daughter named Ashley. Ashley lives &#39;a quiet life&#39; and is frequently in and out of rehab for various substance abuse issues.<br><br>Now sadly, the sanest, most normal one of the 3 surviving kids, Beau, dies in 2015 from a brain tumor. He had been married to Haillie and they had 2 children, a boy and a girl named Natalie, who was 11 yrs old when her dad died.<br><br> Enter Hunter Biden, in 2015, to &quot;comfort&quot; his brother&#39;s widow. Mind you, Hunter is married at the time, to Kathleen Biden, since 1993. He starts screwing around with his dead brother&#39;s wife in 2015...his wife Kathleen finds out about it and they separate. Hunter moves in with his dead brother&#39;s wife, Haillie,and her two kids and they have a grand old time. He ultimately gets divorced from Kathleen in 2017. Meanwhile, he starts screwing around with a stripper,  while still shacking up with his dead brother&#39;s wife, before his divorce is finalized, and gets the stripper pregnant. Haillie kicks his butt to the curb supposedly for this indiscretion in 2018. He denies the stripper&#39;s baby is his, although a paternity test proves otherwise and eventually he marries a woman named Melissa in 2019 after knowing her for 6 days...<br><br>Does the tale end there? Why no, no it doesn&#39;t. <br><br>That just sets the stage...<br>Enter the laptop from hell...loaded with emails, text messages, photos, child pornography,  videos, and other sordid digital images of drug use and rampant weirdness....<br><br>Hunter Biden dropped the laptop off in Delaware, his home state, to get it repaired. It seems he dropped it in some water while in a meth-induced state of mind. He then neglected to pay the $85.00 repair fee and the laptop became the repair shop owner&#39;s property for non-payment. When the owner saw what was on it, he was ao disturbed that he contacted the FBI. No response. The DOJ? No response. Eventually, it landed in Rudy Giuliani&#39;s possession and he turned it over to the Delaware State Police AFTER making 4 copies of the hard drive. Turns out, there&#39;s quite a lot of child pornography on there...much of it involving children on Hunter&#39;s many trips to China. The Chinese Communist Party uses this as a blackmail tactic... They supply the young girls, they film you, unknowingly, and then they can keep you &quot;in line&quot;, while paying you the big $$$ to do their bidding, like lucrative deals with your VP father.<br> Millions of dollars were paid to Hunter Biden for favors with the US Govt while Joe Biden was VP under Obama.<br> <br>For 8 years Hunter made the contacts and split the money with his father, referred to as the &quot;Big Guy&quot; in all emails detailing how their ill gotten gains would be split up amongst all the criminals involved.<br> Joe Biden sold out his country and used his meth head son to do it. ...<br>But, IT GETS WORSE. Today, on the laptop, emails were released between Beau Biden&#39;s widow, Haillie, and Joe Biden in 2017 and more in 2018 when she and Hunter were still living together. They were casually talking about the continual &quot;sexually inappropriate behavior&quot; she had witnessed from Hunter toward her 14 year old daughter, Natalie, HIS NIECE!..<br> She told Joe that she felt she had put her children in a dangerous situation by getting involved with Hunter Biden. Joe knew his son was screwing around with his niece and he advised his daughter-in-law to go to therapy (like she&#39;s the one with a problem).....No one went to the police and the abuse escalated. Joe allowed Hunter to continue sexually abusing his owm grand-daughter. THAT is the main reason she broke off her relationship with Hunter.<br><br> Among the pictures of Hunter having sex with young Asian children, there were hundreds of provocative pictures of a 14 year old girl, mainly topless, and hundreds more of Hunter Biden, in sexual poses with her, HIS NIECE. She was 14 yrs old and HE WAS 48!! <br><br>BOTTOM LINE: ANY MAN WHO CAN&#39;T TAKE CARE OF HIS OWN HOUSE, HAS NO BUSINESS BEING IN THE WHITE HOUSE.<br><br>THE END.....but, is it? Nope. Rudy says there is more to come, primarily involving Joe Biden getting rich off laundering foreign money through our country, using his son as intermediary. Biden is as dirty and crooked as they come. Hillary looks clean compared to him. Now it makes sense why Obama REFUSED to endorse him as the DNC candidate until he was the last man standing!<br><br>Did you see the Hunter footjob &amp; crack-smoking video China just released? Mind-blowing, but the Chinese warn that this video is mild compared to the vides slated for release over the coming days. <br><br>COPY, PASTE &amp; SHARE!!!

Maybe my experience can add to this.<br><br>I\u2019ve been to Lochearnhead in Scotland a good few times. Once, about a day after I got there, I was playing with my compass. I discovered that I could attract the needle with the fingers of my hands, my right more than my left. I could make the needle swing left or right and even up or down depending which plane it was orientated in. This effect grew over a few days, and died off over a few after I got back home. I tried it in various places around the village and surrounding area ( Perth, Killin, etc ) but once I realised I was magnetised, it obviously didn\u2019t matter where I went. I also tried it with different and with no clothes on ( indoors! ), and no metal objects on my person. I was never there for more than a week, so can\u2019t comment long term, except that it died off in a few days when I got back home, many miles away.<br>It was a weak field. It had to be. The needle would still point North if I held the compass by its edge. It was in one of these plastic rules with various scales for use by placing it on OS maps. I had to hover above and almost almost touch the dial with my finger to move the needle. It would move no more than about 30 degrees.<br>All I can say about Lochearnhead which is a nice place to visit is that it is slap bang on the Highland Boundary Fault line.

All of these are symptoms of electro-sensitivity, which is something more and more people are finding themselves affected by. Studies done in 1997 have found \u201cless than a few cases (of electro-sensitivity) per million\u201d, however now as much as 2.5% of the population find themselves affected by electro-sensitivity. Even by most moderate calculations, electro-sensitivity is 1,000 times more common now than it was 20 years ago. Why could this be?<br><br>Electro-sensitivity and its symptoms seem to be triggered by certain microwave frequencies of electromagnetic radiation. Microwaves are frequently used in electronics for the purposes of communication between devices. Due to their high frequency, microwaves allow for higher transmission rates and small antenna sizes, which is perfect for high-tech devices that are constantly getting smaller and faster. These are devices such as cell phones, tablets, laptops, and any devices able to connect to Wi-Fi, which can now include TVs and refrigerators<br><br>Numerous studies, moreover, (2011-2017) report an increased risk of brain cancer due to the use of mobile phones Concern for other cancers: breast (male and female), testicle, leukemia, thyroid and much more. the current classification of radio frequencies as carcinogenic to humans (Class 2B) should be updated to carcinogenic to humans<br>Many claim that this is not true at all or that there is no evidence just to progress with the construction of radio transmitters!<br>And the 5 g accelerates all of this.<br>One piece of advice I would like to give is to equip yourself with devices that protect against electromagnetic waves, such as Aires tech products,produced by AMERICAN AIRES, in my opinion is one of the best on the market<br>5g is part of progress, it is right to progress but why not protect yourself?", "comment_date": "2020-10-18T09:06:47Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "I before A except after K", "comment_text": "So I suppose the next step would be to test people from areas with fewer EM signals and see how they compare to someone living in a modern area with lots of technology.", "comment_date": "2020-10-18T02:53:49Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Peevis", "comment_text": "One could make some very cheap jokes about the decrease in alpha power under a changing magnetic field...", "comment_date": "2020-10-17T16:31:15Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Wind Medicine", "comment_text": "MRIs are always an interesting experience for those that pick up on it.

Main reason being that with the inverse problem with EEG it would be interesting to locate particular areas of the scalp or &#39;generators&#39; that respond greater to magnetic field changes. For instance, given that &#39;alpha&#39; oscillations mainly originate from the visual cortex (i.e. when eyes are closed) it would be interesting to see a measurement of &#39;alpha-change&#39; across the whole scalp over the whole event epoch.  However, I would like to know a bit more about the implications of this, for instance, transcranial magnetic stimulation has been used for a number of years and so surely this experiment is a &#39;large TMS&#39; machine except that it doesn&#39;t deliver a more focal or localised magnetic field to the scalp, perhaps alluding to the idea that we are all compasses&#39; to the earths magnetic field?", "comment_date": "2020-08-28T21:53:46Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Brandon Cardwell", "comment_text": "Bro.

If in ancient times the ancestor was from a warmer climate which did not threaten their survival and force a migration for the season of winter, then they probably had less required use of their ability to sense the polarity purely because they never had to migrate. Counter to that, if an ancient ancestor did live in a more moderate climate threatening their survival their sensitivity is not stronger, but they are more in tune to it chemically because it was necessary and they used it often. It is an ingrained design of survival. This, I believe is because biblically we were not created to have clothing. But were meant to live in &quot;Eden&quot;, but upon the floods during Noah&#39;s time his children emigrated to vast lands to find wives. Therein there was human settlement in other environmental conditions. If you are a descendant of one of the ancient ancestors from where migrating for winter to a warmer climate was necessary (as designed in all our bodies), you would likely be pre-disposed to greater &quot;sensitivity&quot;,strength of this polarity sense. The further your genealogical line gets from this blood line the less necessary it is to hone the ability. Now with heated homes and food supply made readily by the industrial revolution, and free trade we no longer must migrate to survive. It is still there, I believe it is just &quot;sleeping&quot; in some people because it is just not used. This is nothing about evolution, as that does not exist. This is about a primitive and ingrained ability that some use, and some do not purely out of a lack of need. It could also confirm why I think some people get headaches with an increased barometric pressure, it is telling us we need to protect our bodies to survive.

When laying in bed I recalled this info several times.<br>I then made a game out of it to be able to tell which direction would be east and south, by laying on the ground anywhere we would go, imagining with my eyes closed I would be laying in my bed and adjusting my body so that it was laying in the same direction as I was at home. Pointing in the direction of where I knew east must be I opened my eyes, checked with my compass and was astonished myself that my &quot;prediction&quot; was correct. I repeated this &quot;game&quot; in different places several times because I was so amazed by the effect that I was a &quot;human compass&quot; with - retroperspectivly speaking - an accuracy that is still astonishing to me, being off by max 15\u00b0 and hitting it on the nail often.<br>So yes, since my redirection of the body after feeling the right position was a concious process, I would say it is possible.", "comment_date": "2019-09-28T17:02:23Z", "likes_count": 51}, {"comment_by": "troylabrie", "comment_text": "Another way to look at the question is whether or not magnetic sense can be developed.<br><br>I&#39;ve read a study done by an anthropologisy among hunter-gatherers who have a highly developed sense of cardinal directions (l think in New Guinea).

There are basically two types of deictic systems, egocentric (relative to self as point of reference) and sociocentric (absolute and uses a comon representation of the space as frame of reference). Lots of cultures use both types in diferent contexts, others tend to use more one of them. In my opinion, the tendency to use one more than other has litle to do with an innate orientation sense and is not so motivated by it as by social conditions in which the use of language occurs, however, the use of one of these systems might develop or atenuate the sense of orientation. For me it has more to do with the context of language use. If i am navigating with a crew or playing soccer, i rather be sociocentric, if i am giving instructions to someone who doesnt know the space in which he is moving and thus has no representations of it which serve as reference frame, i rather explain him how to get somewhere in egocentric terms (relative to his position like right, left etc.).  Maybe we have a very individualistic society in which egocentric deictic systems are more abundant, but imagine you live in a more colectivist and strongly bounded group like a band of hunter gatherers or a pirate crew in which common understandings really matter to get any thing done right without the confusions of the relativity to the speaker.

The real test imo, would be if changes in those waves could be detected when not influenced by the simulated environment. I realize vestibular changes would most likely have an effect on the human brain and this test was to eliminate that variable, but one should study what those alpha waves look like and then decern between them and the magnetic shift.

Thats not hyperbole either, I don&#39;t remember the exact number but we may be saturated in even more than a million times strength and concentration of these fields. With our cell tower and satellites, even IF WE HAD the ability to sense magnetic fields, there&#39;s too much junk data out there. Our receivers would be scrambled with an overload of superfluous signals, and there would be no way of differentiating from one wave source and another, kinda like static on a T.V.

My cousins were greatly amused at my bafflement. For another, I worked in a shipyard most of my career. Going below in a steel ship resulted in a change in my sense of direction I could best describe by comparing stereoscopic color vision to monocular monochrome. I could still orient and navigate but I suspect my senses were used in different combinations by my perceptions. In my younger days took a mountain climbing course and I always excelled in the map and pathfinding exercises, keeping my group on the return trail even after a heavy snowfall. My sense of direction remained strong throughout my life until I had a stroke at age 64 when it became greatly diminished.<br><br>Maybe I&#39;m making too much of this but I think it&#39;s worth mentioning as a datum for the researchers you interviewed.", "comment_date": "2019-03-18T19:51:09Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "B McFarland", "comment_text": "So.... a garage experiment paid for by my tax dollars...
