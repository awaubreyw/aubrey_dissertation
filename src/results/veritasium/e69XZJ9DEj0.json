Reflexes like sneezing, eye tearing, salivation, and lactation have what Gil Wilshire, who insists he is a &quot;reproductive endocrinologist&quot; and not a font, as I want to believe, describes as &quot;lower reflex loops&quot; that sometimes misfire and get all mixed up.&quot;<br><br><br>So girls, if your other half is at the computer at night and starts sneezing, he&#39;s not reading the news. ;-)", "comment_date": "2019-04-07T22:05:47Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Azzam Alqudsi", "comment_text": "Let the placebo  begin!", "comment_date": "2019-04-07T20:05:31Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Amar Gupta", "comment_text": "Yes I am a sun sneezer", "comment_date": "2019-04-07T16:51:22Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "\ubc29\uad6c\ubfe1\uc0a5\ubf55", "comment_text": "me too!!", "comment_date": "2019-04-07T15:43:25Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Migo", "comment_text": "what if he did not sneeze?", "comment_date": "2019-04-07T14:31:08Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "ElSanti", "comment_text": "I&#39;m a Sun-Sneezer too.", "comment_date": "2019-04-06T16:33:41Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "dadpls comhome", "comment_text": "Instruction unclear.<br><br>I sneezed out a star.", "comment_date": "2019-04-06T11:59:52Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "joe wight", "comment_text": "I&#39;m a sun sneezer I&#39;ve known ever since grade school and as long as it&#39;s not from being sick I enjoy the feeling of a sneeze every time I walk outside", "comment_date": "2019-04-06T09:55:49Z", "likes_count": 24}, {"comment_by": "Thomas Okken", "comment_text": "The 19th century German poet, humorist, illustrator and painter Wilhelm Busch wrote a comic strip about a man who takes a pinch of snuff tobacco, and, when it fails to produce the desired sneeze, moves things along by looking into sunlight: <a href=\"https://gutenberg.spiegel.de/buch/die-prise-4202/1\">https://gutenberg.spiegel.de/buch/die-prise-4202/1</a><br><br>The text below the eighth panel, &quot;Und hilft auch alles dieses nicht / So hilft ein Blick ins Sonnenlicht&quot; translates roughly as &quot;And if none of this should work, a look into sunlight surely will.&quot;<br><br>I read this as a child, and being a sun-sneezer myself, always assumed it affected everyone the same.

These foxes had a much more soft fur and wagged their tail among other traits - in other words - they were suddenly much like dogs. And this change wouldn&#39;t be possible without clusters.

What the study showed was that an somebody who has that SNP is more likely to be a sun sneezer than somebody who does not. This doesn&#39;t imply that the SNP has any functional importance in the photic sneeze reflex. The way in which these studies work is that they sequence the DNA of the participants and compare the changes which come up more often than you would expect by chance in the sun sneezers&#39; DNA vs non-sun sneezers&#39; DNA. Unfortunately, sequencing the entire genome of a person is not cheap. Instead, what the researchers do is they look very specifically only for these SNPs. SNPs, like many mutations, arise purely by chance and the vast majority of the time don&#39;t have any harmful effects at all. The reason they are useful to a geneticist is because they are scattered throughout everybody&#39;s DNA and act like little markers of inheritance. This is because, if they are sitting right next to a gene, then most of the time they get carried with the gene when you inherit it from your parents. So, if for instance you have brown eyes, there will be little SNPs which get carried around with the brown eyes genes when you inherit them. So the way in which companies like 23andMe know what colour your eyes are is because they look for SNPs in your DNA which are known to be passengers near genes which give you brown eyes, or blue eyes etc. The SNP which Derek talks about in the video is, therefore, a passenger to the genes which make you a sun-sneezer but isn&#39;t what makes you a sun-sneezer - you&#39;re just far more likely to have it if you are. The sequencing that the study did would not actually be able to find the changes in the gene which make you a sun-sneezer because it only looks for single letter changes. I hope that is clear. If anybody has any questions, I would be very happy to answer them as best as I can.

The optic nerve (cranial nerve II) is the input from the retina to the brain.  I know of three possible ways to CN II could mediate the response: 1) thalamus-cortex, 2) hypothalamus, 3) tectum.  I think the latter is the most likely.  The thalamus-cortex paths are pretty much dedicated to vision.  The retinohypothalamic circuitry is important for entraining day/night circadian rhythms.  The rectinotectal path is a phylogenetically ancient circuit for orienting head movement to light.  The superior colliculus of the tectum is responsible for the reflex movement of the head toward bright light flashes, just as the inferior colliculus mediates reflex movements due to loud noises.  (It is a reflex, irrespective of neck pain, contra the Brady Bunch.)  Because of the time course and reflex nature of the sneeze reflex, my bet would be that sudden changes from dark to bright light triggers a tectal-brainstem cascade that eventually causes a sneeze.  Whether it has evolutionary significance or is just an epiphenomenon of wiring is speculation.  A second, less likely IMHO opinion, possibility would be cross-talk between the LGN and somatosensory areas of the thalamus (which would account for the tickling sensation).

Your sneeze reflex is normally intended to expel potentially-harmful irritants from your respiratory system before they can cause further harm. Viruses and bacteria hijack this so that they can use the symptom to spread themselves, but there is no personal benefit to sneezing later without any provocation and the normal reflex obviously exists for a survival reason. Instead, what I see is that it WAS provoked. The reaction of your un-adjusted eyes to sudden bright sunlight exposure is much the same as they would react to an airborne irritant. The primary difference is that an airborne irritant would usually also be detected by your nose which would probably also get irritated. Think about the advantages we get from having neurons that fire together, wire together. These two reactions so often go hand-in-hand that one could serve as an early-warning system for the other, possibly saving the life of someone who sneezes when their eyes are irritated even without involving the sinuses. I imagine some ancient spore that was deadly once inhaled in human lungs but only an irritant in human eyes. If the eyes triggered a sneeze, there&#39;s a better chance that the sneeze reflex would clear your respiratory system of the spore and give you warning that there is something dangerous here (&quot;back away!&quot;).", "comment_date": "2017-04-27T22:29:54Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Jason Skywalker", "comment_text": "Well, at least I&#39;m in the minority in one way...", "comment_date": "2017-04-27T22:29:39Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Dr Scythe", "comment_text": "Double sun sneezer.
