This life is temporary once you die you spend eternity in one of two places so choose heaven or hell. Jesus loved you to die for you. He says you all are valuable if you turn from your sins he will bless you like never before and he wants to call you son and daughter but whenever you sin you choose hell and choose to hate God. Now you may say I&#39;m a good person which is actually not true (Mark 10:18). But did you know that not even forgiving others is enough to send you to hell. Jesus is very serious about sin in fact Jesus says most people go to hell and few enter heaven (Mathew <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7pSqk-XV2QM&amp;t=7m13s\">7:13</a>-14). No sin is worth going to hell for when someone goes to hell you can never escape your there forever and you will feel the pain forever . It&#39;s not worth it You can live in heaven forever where Jesus serves you food and you can be in God&#39;s presence forever where you&#39;re never sad or depressed and have a mansion as well. There is Good news If you come to Jesus humbly and confess your sins and beg him for mercy and forgiveness he will forgive you. But you can&#39;t continue to willfully sin (Hebrews 10:26) Because Jesus also says if you love me keep my commandments (John 14:15) you immediately need to repent from all your sins (Luke 13:3) and follow up with Jesus. Remember Follow Jesus only no religion no man Jesus rose from the dead. We have 500 eyewitnesses of it. Jesus is coming back soon with no mercy, seek the lord now while he may be found. When he rose from the dead he proved everything he said was true Muhamad or Buddha didn&#39;t rise from the dead.

Eastman made plastics and other chemicals, Kodak made film, and Holston defense made things that go boom.  (Often from byproducts of the other processes.)  They supplied Oak Ridge with chemicals and munitions.  You don&#39;t often hear about those plants, because people didn&#39;t talk about them, but Eastman is now headquartered in Kingsport.  Kodak knew what was going on, because their, &quot;brother&quot; was part of it. They couldn&#39;t just come out and say they knew what was going on though.  People up here in East Tennessee were proud of what they had been a part of, but were not able to talk about it for years.  This was technology that would have taken decades to develop that they had to do in less than five years.  There were a lot of unintended consequences because of the rush.  Many of those consequences remained secret for years.  Fall out was part of that.  Holston Defense would go on to be a major world supplier of RDX and C4 before being bought by BAE Systems.  Kodak would be phased out in the 90s, as film was replaced by digital.  Eastman and Oak Ridge Laboratories are still around.  Kodak knew, and by offering to sue the government, it would expose the extent of the fall out.

Hey California: Label the air from Nevada &quot;Proposition 65 Warning for California Customers: WARNING: Cancer and Reproductive Harm.&quot;<br><br>Here&#39;s a fun bit of information: the mechanism which allows viruses, bacteria, and immune stimulants to enter the central nervous system is related to a compromised immune system. Environmental factors lead to compromised immune systems. <br><br>Vaccines such as Pertussis and MMR (Measles Mumps Rubella) can cause encephalitis. Encephalitis is an auto-immune condition that can effect the CNS (Central Nervous System) and the neurons in the the brain. When permeation of the BBB (Blood Brain Boundary) occurs by a virus, bacteria, part of a virus, or immune stimulant through the lymphatic system the immune response in the CNS and brain causes the anti-bodies which normally fight infections to instead attack the neural receptors because they are similar to the receptor sights on viruses. <br><br>Encephalitis can cause ABI (Acquired Brain Injury) which presents with the same range of symptoms as severe ASD (Autism Spectrum Disorder). In fact, encephalitis is often extremely difficult to diagnose, and lies well beyond the scope of most doctors and hospital workers. Some neurologists are specialized in understanding encephalitis, while others specialize in genetic disorders like ASD. There is a conflict of diagnoses because the severe range of ASD is not well understood, not confirmed to be genetic, suspected to be caused by viruses/bacteria/immune stimulants, and where the most tragic cases unfold. <br><br>Encephalitis is covered under the National Vaccine Injury Compensation Program in accordance with section 312(b) of the National Childhood Vaccine Injury Act of 1986. The Vaccine Injury Table is provided by the HRSA (Health Resources and Services Administration) and the CDC (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention). Autism is not covered by the National Vaccine Injury Compensation Program.<br><br>Encephalitis could easily be mistaken as severe ASD. In that case the family has no compensation to help them care for a severely disabled child. In the worst case the infant may die of SIDS (Sudden Infant Death Syndrome) and due to bruising and necrosis caused by encephalitis it may be determined that the mother shook or abused her child; several mothers have been wrongfully convicted and put in jail after losing a child.<br><br>Now mothers like this are subjected to meme like ridicule and group slander/bullying. <br><br>Don&#39;t take my word for it; go look at videos of a child who has autism vs. encephalitis. Ask a neurologist if there is a possibility of misdiagnosis. <br><br>I couldn&#39;t figure out what would motivate them to hide the truth; but when I realized the mechanism that allows encephalitis to strike is a compromised immune system due to environmental factors; that was the KEY; corporate/military industrial pollution = class action lawsuits.", "comment_date": "2021-04-18T17:20:40Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "ND R", "comment_text": "Thanks for interesting content!", "comment_date": "2021-04-18T16:35:28Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "bananomet", "comment_text": "<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7pSqk-XV2QM&amp;t=10m10s\">10:10</a> oh you are so naive.

All the credit should go to the female scientist Lise Meitner along with her nephew, Otto Frisch.   <br>She is the Nobel Prize winning scientist that should be given all due credit to the understanding of how a radioactive nucleolus undergoes &quot;fission&quot;.  In reality the nucleolus does not &quot;split&quot; but rather undergoes an &quot;explosion&quot; of sorts.    It does not &quot;split&quot; as we usually think of the term.  Uranium and Plutonium atoms do not &quot;split&quot; when they undergo nuclear fission,  they &quot;explode&quot;.  This is why the Nazi&#39;s were trying make &quot;heavy water&quot; so that they could slow down the neutrons that were aimed at other Uranium atoms.   The extra neutron does not really &quot;cut like a knife&quot; as we have been lead to believe as kids in grammar school text books.  What really happens is that the already &quot;overstuffed&quot; nucleus&#39; are already &quot;wobbling&quot; with high temperatures in overstuffed wobbling situations.  Instead of the old philosophy of having one extra neutron speed past and  &quot;slice&quot; through the extra nucleolus, what really happens is that the extra neutron is &quot;slowed down enough&quot; to hopefully &quot;attach&quot; itself on to an already &quot;overstuffed&quot; wobbling nuclear mass.   Once  the overstuffed wobbling mass happens to &quot;catch&quot; one more extra neutron, or another piece of flying debris,  this extra neutron attaches itself onto another nearby already &quot;overstuffed wobbling&quot; vibrating mass.  The extra neutron, (or flying piece of debris) if slowed down and is lucky enough to attach itself onto an already overstuffed wobbling mass of neutrons, it will allow another explosion of sorts to occur.  It will (not split) because the nucleolus is already super critical and can&#39;t handle any more wobbling from other free flying neutrons, but it will &quot;explode&quot; if another piece of debris attaches itself to an already overstuffed wobbling mass of overstuffed nuclear wobbling particles, like plutonium or U-235, which is already so unstable that it&#39;s wobbling mass is ready to intercept anything that might be allowed to attached to it, like another neutron. <br>              Once an extra free flying random neutron is allowed to attach itself to another overstuffed atom of plutonium or Uranium 235, the nucleolus will accept &quot;only&quot;  one more piece of junk (most likely another neutron) before the chit hits the fan.    Then it will cause the center mass to &quot;over wobble&quot; and explode giving off other bits and pieces of free flying debris.   Some of those exploded bits and pieces of debris will go on to  attach near other over stuffed wobbling super critical atoms that will also &quot;super wobble&quot; and will &quot;explode&quot;.   They may not &quot;split&quot;, but they explode giving off more debris causing a &quot;chain reaction allowing other wobbling atoms that are already overstuffed to accept one more piece of debris before it too be &quot;explode&quot;.  <br>  If anybody requires a citation to support this process, please refer to the book/audio book  &quot;E=MC2 by David Bodonis.  It is generally accepted that this theory is from the mind of  a woman with assistance from her nephew, Otto Frisch, who co-discovered the process while spending their time on snow skies in the cold woods during a beautiful light snow shower.  Her name is Lisa Meitner, the Nobel prize winning genius who discovered nuclear fission, a term coined by her and given credit to her by Nobel authorities.  But being a woman at the time, historically she was wrongfully overlooked by the Nazis as a Jewish female scientist  when the Nazi&#39;s did not permit scientific credit to persons of her heritage. <br>           It may have been her nephew, Otto Frisch who helped her discover the way an overstuffed nuclease  divides during a radioactive disintegration of a particle.  Meitner is known as the &quot;Mother of the Atomic Bomb&quot; because she discovered the theory of nuclear fission along with her nephew, Otto Frisch.  She was the first to understand that a free neutron didn&#39;t need to go &quot;fast&quot; in order to split and atom.  She realized that only &quot;one extra neutron&quot; was needed to fly by slowly enough that should it &quot;attach&quot; to an already overstuffed wobbling unstable mass, the free flying neutron will attach to another and make the other mass  &quot;super wobble&quot; until it can not longer handle the vibrations.  It will become &quot;super critical&quot; and &quot;explode&quot;.  It would not split, as we haver been taught in elementary school, but it would explode.<br>              In short, Lisa Meitner first discovered the atomic bomb&#39;s essential theory of how a super critical particle  might  (explode).  Lise Meitner made it clear that a nuclear mass does not &quot;split&quot;, but rather it becomes so unstable it &quot;explodes&quot;.", "comment_date": "2021-02-16T23:56:24Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Chris P.", "comment_text": "The real question: How did his beard go from gray to dark brown?", "comment_date": "2021-02-16T23:54:47Z", "likes_count": 11}, {"comment_by": "Simon Wang", "comment_text": "The crabby input coincidentally mess up because beginner covalently grin circa a hissing astronomy. ill, available clef", "comment_date": "2021-02-16T23:43:20Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Anthony Phung", "comment_text": "The unknown damage micrencephaly hook because trigonometry meteorologically advise notwithstanding a screeching carbon. neighborly, bloody camera", "comment_date": "2021-02-16T22:58:50Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "kongelio", "comment_text": "We can easely say that more than half the global pollution, CO2 and radiation ever, has come from the USA, worst part is that they won&#39;t really make a difference for good, only for bad.

Radium does NOT glow unless there is a massive enough quantity to cause Cerencov radiation (blue light generated when a particle exceeds the speed of light in the medium, in this case, air. an optical shock wave)  Even then the glow is faint.  Radium dials and watches glowed brightly because the radium is mixed with silver-activated zinc sulfide.  ZnS absorbs an alpha particle, is excited to a higher energy state and when it falls back to the ground energy state, it gives off that characteristic green glow.<br><br>Regarding alleged deaths from I-131 contamination of milk, the 8000 excess deaths were determined by using the long discredited Linear No Threshold (LNT).  Here is an analogy I like to use to show how silly this theory is.  Suppose I took a bullet and gently tapped you on the chest until I had delivered 1000 ft-lbs.  Other than being annoyed, you&#39;d still be perfectly alive and OK.  If I delivered that same energy all at once as a rifle shot to the chest, you&#39;d be dead.  The LNT says that any amount of radiation, regardless of the speed delivered (dose rate)  is harmful.  So back to our analogy.  Using the LNT theory, after I had tapped your chest enough to deliver 1000 ft-lbs, you&#39;d be dead.  Absurd, isn&#39;t it.<br><br>I could find no raw data on the net so I did a few back-of-the-matchbook calculations and using a Gaussian distribution of the dose delivered to the children, I estimate the true death rate to be less than 500, probably less than 200.  The panty-wetters will whine that &quot;that&#39;s 200 too many&quot;.  I wonder what the death and disablement statistics were for Polio back then.<br><br>The model that best fits the evidence is the radiation hormesis theory.  This theory states that low level radiation exposure, especially if it is chronic, is actually good for the person.  There is a threshold above which the radiation again becomes harmful.  Probably the greatest example of this is the famous radioactive high rise apartments in Taiwan.  A cancer therapy source had been illegally disposed of in a scrap metal stream.  This scrap was melted and extruded into I-beams.  Several high rise   apartment buildings were built from these I-beams.  The radiation dose was very high.  It was discovered about 10 years (about 2 half-lives for cobalt-60) later when an occupant took a roll of film to be developed but the radiation had fogged it to black.  Google &quot;Taiwan radioactive buildings&quot; for more info.  The interesting thing was, when they studied the population, some of which had lived there the entire 10 years, the cancer rates of all types were DRAMATICALLY lower than the general population.<br><br>The LNT still hangs on simply because so many people are making so much money from it.", "comment_date": "2020-10-31T22:22:59Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "antony lawson", "comment_text": "OMG  I just got the fallout3 trinity tower reference after 14 years", "comment_date": "2020-10-31T21:28:02Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Dorthy Anderson", "comment_text": "the government protected rolls of film, but not the lives of our kids. there is something wrong with this picture.<br><br>man, the level of the puns back then was really something else. respect.", "comment_date": "2020-10-31T18:23:47Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Ricardo Pesenti", "comment_text": "Seeing the bomb peak in samples is really interesting.

It turned out that Germany did not seriously work on a nuclear bomb, so our fears were not vindicated.  But because we did not know that until the war was nearly over, we did have cause to worry, and what we did was justified.<br>After the war, we learned that the Soviet Union had spies in our program, and they had stolen plans for our bomb.  They made bombs of their own.  Years later, they stole plans for our hydrogen bomb.

The effect was a higher than normal cancer rate in Titusville Florida in those between 60 and 75 years of age between 1995 and 2015. The cancer cases were non-specific carcinomas ranging from lungs and kidneys to brains. Generally, in blood filtering organs. Considering all of the KSC worker cancer patients were married and none of the spouses (not from West Virginia) were diagnosed with cancer, the source had a thread that possibly could lead to root cause. Titusville Florida was considered one of the areas with lower carcinogen identification and low level background radiation sources in the US which and was counter to the increased cancer rates. NASA was fairly careful (more careful as time and knowledge progressed) with life safety and carcinogens. So, how could this anomaly occur? One possibility is related to the workers that were part of the early days of Kennedy Space Center (KSC). These workers were young during the 50s. More importantly, a significant percentage of the workers at KSC were from West Virginia and were of a young age during the testing and possible fallout. Once all of the pieces began to come together, a picture of a possible cause began to form. The increased cancer rates appeared to correlate to KSC workers that grew up in the north east and mid west during the 50s. The interesting part of this story is that this is a rare case of a population that migrated from a possible hot zone to a cold zone in the 50s where the cancer rates may have followed the population and differed from the indigenous population. The insurance companies focused on the coal mines in West Virginia as a cause. Understandable for the lung cancer patients. Less so for the kidney and brain cancer patients. As a side note, kidney cancer patients are commonly identified as a cause of death related to brain and lung cancer masking the true cause. The reason for this is kidney cancer is often followed by kidney removal and post operative remaining cancer cells in the blood finding a filter organ (brain and lungs) to metastasize commonly resulting in a cause of death being diagnosed as lung cancer. When a patient passes who was recently diagnosed with lung cancer, doctors rarely (if ever) look for a scar from a previously ectomy (e.g. laparoscopic kidney removal) to note on the death certificate a possible previous diagnosis related to the cause of death.", "comment_date": "2020-10-01T05:42:18Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Akilan Paramasivam", "comment_text": "People in California born in that time were very lucky", "comment_date": "2020-10-01T05:21:16Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "TheAnomaly", "comment_text": "oddly enough I came here to kill some time while waiting for the next episode of Raised by Wolves.", "comment_date": "2020-10-01T04:55:06Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "rm", "comment_text": "The us government would rather protect a business than the health of the population.

So, looking at the map showing rad levels across the country after the nuclear tests, it appears that only the northern part of New York State had any significant levels, but the test results they mentioned correlating blood levels of strontium 90 and cancer incidence came from New York City. Why wasn&#39;t this testing done in the states in the west and midwest, where the measured rad levels were clearly hazardous? The cancer incidence after the nuclear tests commenced in 1945 and continuing until 1963, along with the strontium 90 blood levels, had to have been horrendously high in the milk-producing states of the midwest--much higher than they were in New York City. By the way, in my close Iowa family alone (aunts, uncles, grandparents), since the onset of nuclear testing in 1945, 8 family members have died from cancer. And I also was diagnosed with cancer in 1988, but have so far thankfully survived. However, as a result of the chemotherapy I received (bleomycin), I had to have a bilateral lung transplant 2 and a half years ago.

Joetrons traves to the empty space(Where there is no Joetrons) faster than light along with the matter around it, that is why the galaxies are moving further away.

The &quot;Baby tooth&quot; study you referred to has been repeatedly shown to be entirely junk science.   The &quot;chief investigator&quot; of it is known by the majority of those in science and medicine as a documented contemptible fraud.  There is zero evidence of any harm even from strontium 90 from nuclea weapons fallout. Other than one instance where inches of dust of fallout, an hour or two after a huge yield H-bomb test in the Pacific covered the deck and crew of a Japanese fishing boat... and the facts even in that case show how relatively harmless radiation is.  I suggest you educate yourself concerning biological effects of radiation, instead of parroting quack medicine and hysterical junk science in your Youtube video.  NO ONE got ANY disease from distant windblown fallout from nuclear testing.   Where did you say you got your MD?   Where did you study epidemiology?  People ARE less sensitive to radiation than is film.   By a thousand fold or more.   And there&#39;s a good reason why this is so:   <br><br>Life evolved on earth for 3 billion years against a background of radiation.   It evolved during that time highly sophisticated (and now at least in part documented and known) mechanisms for repairing damage to DNA (and other sorts of damage) made by radiation.  Completely and rapidly (within hours).   So unless one is exposed to truly massive doses of radiation at a high rate, that overwhelm these mechanisms,  such minute exposures to radiation as those from radioactive fallout poses entirely zero  risk to health... acutely or 50 years later. <br><br>Unlike our living cells, photographic film cannot repair the change (&quot;damage&quot;) done by even a single particle of radiation hitting it.  <br><br>Have you examined the major studies on which all of our knowledge of biological effects of radiation are known?  The Hiroshima Nagasaki LSS study?  The study of the &quot;radium girls&quot;?  THe study of the thousands in Taiwan exposed to gamma rays from cobalt 60 in the rebar of their newly built apartment buildings?   I&#39;m a physician, and I have.  These show how massively false are the claims you make in your video.   <br><br>If you want to educate yourself, I suggest you start by reading the book &quot;Nuclear is for Life&quot;, by acclaimed particle physicist Wade Allison, who spent years after his retirement educating himself extensively in medicine and epidemiology.  There these (and many more) key studies are presented...  and analyzed... and you will learn that near everything you said in this video that implies health risk from atomic testing fallout is entirely false.  There are hundreds of expositions of this, but in my years of experience (as an MD with with a strong physical science background... in part from Harvard) studying this subject, &quot;Nuclear is for Life&quot; by Wade Allison is the single best one to read first.   <br><br>&quot;Nuclear is for life&quot; is best ... or most quickly, anyway...  understood by someone with a good general educated person type background in science and math.  Given it is written by an Oxford professor of particle physics.  But you appear to me to have the capability to rapidly absorb things requiring such general knowledge.<br><br>Please.   Read it, and learn.   You do such a good job in many of your other videos.  And the titular material in this one about Kodak is excellent, too.   it thus especially saddens me to see you spread outrageous, deadly, malignant, science-denying, superstition, quack medicine, and junk-science-based falsehood in this one with respect the (non existent) health dangers from &quot;atomic bomb fallout&quot;.<br><br>I&#39;m not supporting development or use of nuclear weapons, of course.  These are horrific things.  But they are horrific not from their radiation release, which is near entirely harmless, but due to their blast and heat. The problem is the massive falsehoods you parrot here do deadly harm to our heath, and to the health of the planet, by creating false fear of radiation, which underlies a lot of the false notions that nuclear power... the only thing capable of replacing fossil fuel as our source of electrical power in a way that can lower greenhouse gas emissions effectively... is other than overwhelmingly safe.<br><br>While radiation is basically harmless in all but extraordinary cases of massively high exposure,  hysteria regarding the near entirely non-existent risk it poses (that you have encouraged in this video)  KILLS.   2000 died from an entirely needless and prolonged evacuation of people from around Fukushima, most now agree.   10,000 to 100,000 women in Western Europe elected to have abortions for otherwise wanted pregnancies, hysterical about the possibility they would give birth to deformed children because they&#39;d been exposed to the &quot;plume of radiation&quot; from the Chernobyl accident... a &quot;plume&quot; that, in Western Europe, entailed radiation levels a tiny fraction of low normal background radiation.  These women exposed to that &quot;plume of radiation&quot;  were  exposed to radiation levels well over 1,000 times lower than the radiation exposure pregnant survivors of the atomic bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki experienced... and there was no higher incidence of birth defects there.  Further, when the children born were followed for decades, there was ZERO indication of any ill effect that could be related to that radiation exposure.  ZERO.<br><br>Please... I urge you... educate yourself, and stop spreading here on Youtube ignorant and deadly misinformation regarding the biological effects of radiation.  Join those those of us trying to educate the public and policy makers by presenting scientific method based good clinical research / intellectually honest   / evidence based science and science based medicine concerning this.", "comment_date": "2020-09-18T09:07:07Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Adrian Hrodek", "comment_text": "Government: where can we bomb so that people are safe?<br>Scientists: go as far east as possible<br>Government: west it is then!<br>Scientists: \ud83d\udc41\ud83d\udc44\ud83d\udc41", "comment_date": "2020-09-18T09:02:33Z", "likes_count": 2538}, {"comment_by": "Sean Ngui", "comment_text": "<b>taps fancy red Cadillac</b> \u201cthis is the trinity bomb test site\u201d", "comment_date": "2020-09-18T08:59:13Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Jonathan Roy-thibault", "comment_text": "The fallout stop at the Canadian border.

Robert Oppenheimer, director of the Manhattan Project, could hardly breathe. Years of secrecy, research, and tests were riding on this moment. &quot;For the last few seconds, he stared directly ahead and when the announcer shouted Now!&#39; and there came this tremendous burst of light followed abruptly there after by the deep growling of the explosion, his face relaxed into an expression of tremendous relief,&quot; recalled General L. R. Groves of Oppenheimer, in a memorandum for Secretary of War Stimson. The explosion carrying more power than 20,000 tons of TNT and visible for more than 200 miles succeeded. The world&#39;s first atomic bomb had been detonated.<br><br>With the advent of the nuclear age, new dilemmas in the art of warfare arose. The war in Europe had concluded in May. The Pacific war would receive full attention from the United States War Department. As late as May 1945, the U.S. was engaged in heavy fighting with the Japanese at Iwo Jima and Okinawa. In these most bloody conflicts, the United States had sustained more than 75,000 casualties. These victories insured the United States was within air striking distance of the Japanese mainland. The bombing of Pearl Harbor by the Japanese to initiate United States entrance into the war, just four years before, was still fresh on the minds of many Americans.<br><br>A feeling of vindication and a desire to end the war strengthened the resolve of the United States to quickly and decisively conclude it. President Harry Truman had many alternatives at his disposal for ending the war: invade the Japanese mainland, hold a demonstration of the destructive power of the atomic bomb for Japanese dignitaries, drop an atomic bomb on selected industrial Japanese cities, bomb and blockade the islands, wait for Soviet entry into the war on August 15, or mediate a compromised peace. Operation Olympia, a full scale landing of United States armed forces, was already planned for Kyushu on November 1, 1945 and a bomb and blockade plan had already been instituted over the Japanese mainland for several months.<br><br>The Japanese resolve to fight had been seriously hampered in the preceding months. Their losses at Iwo Jima and Okinawa had been staggering. Their navy had ceased to exist as an effective fighting force and the air corps had been decimated. American B-29&#39;s made bombing runs over military targets on the Japanese mainland an integral part of their air campaign. Japan&#39;s lack of air power hindered their ability to fight. The imprecision of bombing and the use of devastating city bombing in Europe eventually swayed United States Pacific theater military leaders to authorize bombing of Japanese mainland cities. Tokyo, Nagoya, Osaka, and Kobe all were decimated by incendiary and other bombs.<br><br>In all, hundreds of thousands of civilians were killed in these air strikes meant to deter the resolve of the Japanese people. Yet, Japanese resolve stayed strong and the idea of a bloody &quot;house to house&quot; invasion of the Japanese mainland would produce thousands more American and Allied casualties. The Allies in late July 1945 declared at Potsdam that the Japanese must unconditionally surrender.<br><br>After Japanese leaders flatly rejected the Potsdam Declaration, President Truman authorized use of the atomic bomb anytime after August 3, 1945. On the clear morning of August 6, the first atomic bomb, nicknamed Little Boy, was dropped on the city of Hiroshima. Leveling over 60 percent of the city, 70,000 residents died instantaneously in a searing flash of heat. Three days later, on August 9, a second bomb, Fat Man, was dropped on Nagasaki <br>Over 20,000 people died instantly. In the successive weeks, thousands more Japanese died from the after effects of the radiation exposure of the blast", "comment_date": "2020-09-17T14:40:36Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Ye 2020", "comment_text": "Anyone know what the instrumental at <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7pSqk-XV2QM&amp;t=4m10s\">4:10</a> is called?", "comment_date": "2020-09-17T14:36:19Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "reybley", "comment_text": "Thank god that the radiation in the wind stopped at the boarder before Canada.", "comment_date": "2020-09-17T14:35:53Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Spindoctor", "comment_text": "While there is some health effects, they seem to be minor.

President Truman was sitting between Stalin, who had lost a terrible number of troops on the Russian Western front and Churchill whose troops were standing next to American soldiers ready to invade the Japanese mainland in an effort to stop the war.  He needed leverage at that table.  The troops, perhaps it was your grandfather, needed a \u201cHail Mary\u201d to survive the pacific war.  Whether all was known or not, the \u201cA Bomb\u201d was a life-saving answer.  The word of success that fateful morning, when a man-made fragment of a sun lit up the NM sky, was radioed to Truman.  He had his leverage.  Your birth was now going to happen. Subsequently scientists learned much more about side-effects and negotiators brought the spread of radiation to a standstill.  So, be happy you don\u2019t have to speak Japanese - or German.  (Read or see \u201cMan in the High Castle\u201d by Dick.). Better yet, read up on your history.

I see comments relating the power of the bomb to radiation released, which is also nonsense.\r<br>\r<br>LET&#39;S START WITH THE BASIC\r<br>\r<br>1 - there is electromagnetic radiation. This travels basically at the speed of light. Gamma Rays, UV, Xrays, etc. These can kill you in a nuclear explosion long before the shock wave reaches you. It can fry you. Or it can knock quadrillions of electrons out of the atoms in your body, destroying molecules and your DNA, killing you in hours or days or in a bit longer term, some severe cancer.\r<br>\r<br>2 - there is particle radiation. This is called by alpha and beta particles, emitted at great energies from the Sun (trapped in the Van Allen belts) or from radiactive elements. \r<br>Alpha and Beta particles do about the same thing than electromagnetic particles. They knock elemental particles from the atoms forming molecules in your body. Sometimes even causing small chain reactions that knock more particles from surrounding molecules.\r<br>\r<br>3 - Radioactive elements have half life. The LONGER the half life of an element, the less radiactive it is... meaning that it emits particles at a VERY SLOW RATE. Elements with short half lifes are radiactive for a smaller time... because they emit a LOT of radioactive particles in a short time.\r<br>\r<br>4 - Atomic Fission bombs are radioactive in two ways: they emit burts of electromagnetic radiation when they explode, AND THEY ARE INNEFICIENT, meaning only a small part of it&#39;s fissionable elements actually get fissioned. Over 95% of the radiative elements in Hiroshima did not fissioned, but instead, were POWDERED by the explosion of the 5% that fissioned, and were SPREAD in the air, like powder. That radioactive powder spread in the air, emitting alpha and beta particles.\r<br>\r<br>5 - Pure fusion bombs could be clean, meaning they would only emit radiation when exploding, not leaving radiactivity behind. However, the tech for pure fusion bombs was expensive and the military was not that keen on it. \r<br>\r<br>H-Bombs therefore work through two FISSION BOMBS that act as TRIGGER for the much more powerful fusion bomb. The fission bombs however leave radioactive elements behind, spread in the air.\r<br>\r<br>6- the Chernobyl TV series is full of pseudoscience and urban myths.", "comment_date": "2020-09-16T19:39:12Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "A T", "comment_text": "Great video again, i did not realize we all have those elements inside of us!
