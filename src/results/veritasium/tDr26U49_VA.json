(it will fluctuate until it eventually finds a stable position or stops)<br>at certain points, the disc will oscillate violently due to the center of mass being offset from the center of geometry. (the further the offset, the more unstably it will oscillate)<br>so, (point 1) it will be unstable when the hole is left or right, but stable when the hole is perfectly up or down. (since it is spinning on its rim, it will get close to, but reach neither)<br> 2) The key variable is not up or down but distance from the center mass. Instead of looking at it as &quot;up and down&quot;/&quot;top and bottom&quot;, consider that the variable is actually the distance of the center of mass to the contact point (the ground). The only time gravity affects change on the object&#39;s spin is lateral friction at the point of contact with the ground.<br>The contact point to the ground is the main point at which unstable oscillation will inflict force to change the rotating object&#39;s path. (point 2) when the oscillation is violent and the mass is closer to the ground, the friction force applied against the object is greatest.<br>3) Error begets more error. The more the mass is further from the center axis, the more it will pull itself away from the center axis. so the error will accumulate and it&#39;s spin is inherently unstable.<br><br>The key to why the disc prefers &quot;hole-down&quot; position: When the center of mass is closest to the ground(hole-up), any minor imperfection in the oscillation applies the most direct lateral friction against the ground (the kind that would cause the disc a shift its rotation path) so any imperfection in the oscillation will accumulate until there is &quot;sufficient error&quot; in oscillation to violently force the center of mass off from its &quot;somewhat&quot; stable position to the next &quot;somewhat&quot; stable position. when the center of mass is furthest from the ground the effect repeats, but it can only apply a fraction of the lateral force as before. Therefore it will take longer for the unstable oscillation to accumulate enough error to cause the disc to violently flip again.<br>Therefore, (ignoring the infinitesimally small chance that the disc is perfectly centered (hole-up or hole-down where the lateral force is exactly zero) the condition where the disc remains for majority of its changing spin is with the center of mass furthest from the ground with equal weight on either side.

When you spun the circle on ice, it seemed to  favor hole up and/or hole down, but couldn&#39;t make up it&#39;s mind.  So the initial flip is caused by this effect.  However, friction and leverage are the &quot;dynamic duo&quot; creating stability when hole down.  The object is resting on the bottom most point, and friction takes hold, moving the point of rotation (at least partially) from the center of mass to the point of contact.  Since the center of mass is at it&#39;s furthest from the contact point in this orientation, leverage joins the party.

When the disc has maximum mass in lower side, it has its center of gravity in lower position then the previous condition.

Therefor any upset in the object of such formation in a proper heavy side down would mean that any change would force the object further down, and increase friction even more. In the other way, heavy side is up, and there is room to move the center of gravity down by slightly rotating, and still remaining in balance. If you spin it on perfect axis with heavy side down - it will remain that way. (from other video with iPhone spinning). In no gravity and no friction environment is would keep on spinning in exact way, as you span it in first place. Also there is gyroscopic effect, which will keep it spinning, BUT as it flips, frictions comes in full tilt. On ice (not dry ice) it would change the positions of center of gravity due to friction changing from place to place, is ice is slippery when pressure applied, and at such scale, pressure difference is massive, taking the balance out is easier for mother nature and father physics. Also on parts, where ice is already molten, no pressure needs to be applied in order to decrease friction, so it keeps on going out of balance, and you get the weird wobbly thing. <br>I am not sure, just got to think about it.<br><br>Other comments suggest that it might be the hole in the ring - it has nothing to do, or at least play very, very VERY VERY VERY  little effect.

In this position however (with the disk spinning and the center of mass found in the middle -  equatorial motion) the angular momentum of the center of mass is always changing (radially outwards) so the center of mass gradually rises untill the angular momentum points upwards because at this point the spin of the disk does not change the direction of the angular momentum of the center of mass.", "comment_date": "2015-11-04T11:57:02Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Otter choi", "comment_text": "Does he mean next time he will find the answers or next time because he already knows but doesn&#39;t want to put it in one video", "comment_date": "2015-11-03T09:56:04Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Jon Bruce", "comment_text": "Angular momentum is a complicated and rather deep subject. ;)", "comment_date": "2015-11-02T18:20:30Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Mike Felty", "comment_text": "Amateur physicist alert: I think it has a little bit to do with more than one of the laws already pointed out.

Secondly, let us consider the clip where you drop the disk from a few inches above the ground, and still the disk behaves as before.<br><br>Now let us just talk about centre of mass (CM) and centre of gravity (CG). A body to be in a state of rest when placed on a surface, the CM and CG must coincide.

But that is when it is in rest. But in our experiment, the disk is rotating. And bear in mind, that the rotation causes wobbling. The first instance the disk wobbles, the CG and CM no longer coincide. This creates a torque CM. Leaving it here let us look at another piece of the rotating disk.<br><br>The base, which is in contact with the surface. here, duo to the wobbling effect of rotation, the surface experiences non uniform pattern of friction. This is true even for the rotating top, because, one edge is leading, and the other edge is trailing.

As you spin it; because environmental influence, human error, friction, contact patch, et cetera, the disk falls off of a perpendicular axis and behaves as does a wheel causing the circle to rotate. If you weight a bike wheel and spin it; though it will jump up and down as the added mass is now being thrown around, this doesn&#39;t stop it from spinning and it will still go round and round.<br>What I wonder is if it&#39;s the shifting of mass that causes it to stay inverted due to some gyroscopic forces or what have you.
