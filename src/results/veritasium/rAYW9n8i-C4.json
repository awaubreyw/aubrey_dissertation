It\u2019s kinda scary how much we don\u2019t know. I\u2019ve seen some other videos and read some articles about it and mostly are like yeah the strength of our magnetosphere has dropped by 10 to 6 percent during last 100 to 80 years. Or the earth has had reversing polarities several times through history big whoop. Nothing to worry about.

It is purely speculation for 8 miles is the deepest humans have ever drilled in the earth and that in no way possible suggests that any human &quot;knows&quot; what lies underneath.  It is no wonder why ppl, some, are no longer believing in science and what it stands for!  Passing off THEORY as FACT is not true science, not at all.  That is no different than me saying I KNOW what it feels like to walk on the moon and feel the dust between my toes!  How ridiculous that is!

It is only a supposition in their model that a lighter element like Sulfur would rise out of the inner Iron-Nickel core and spiral up creating any kind of electrical field. 4. They cannot explain where the Sulfur or any other elements came form the inner core. 5. The convection of the outer core electronic field\u2019s swirling or passing next to each other will not create an electrical field and resulting magnetic field on a permanent basis because when you have two electrostatic fields crossing each other they will cancel each other out.<br>A better explanation is that there is a center modulation point in the center of the earth and the information coming into this dimension creates and magnetic field and the rotation of the earth.

I find the definition of action concerning the core of the earth (much less this experiment) a tad difficult to follow. From what I understand about centrifugal/centripetal motion, &#39;centrifugal&#39; motion (I know, I know. it&#39;s not a &#39;real&#39; force) causes heavier mass to be thrown outward away from the axis of rotation. Whereas &#39;centripetal&#39; dictates &#39;toward the center&#39; for lighter mass materials (which I&#39;ve seen demonstrated time and again). The two must  work hand in hand as &#39;reactive forces&#39; to exist. Think not? Ever been on a &#39;rotor ride&#39; at a carnival where you stand against the wall, the ride spins, the bottom drops away and you stick to the wall? Centrifugal force.<br><br>If this is the case, how is it that a solid iron core and molten iron (much heavier than molten and solid rock) maintain their position at the center of earth? Especially considering that the earth spins on its&#39; axis fast enough to cause a bulge at it&#39;s equator and rotates at a velocity nearly twice the speed of sound at its&#39; equator at a diameter of roughly 8,000 miles. This device spins at only four revolutions per second (80 mph). But then again, mechanism is encased by a solid metal shell (and still they seem worried about overcoming material stress) whereas the earth (by current definition) is essentially little more than a mushy flexible mass of molten rock covered by a thin cracked shell of solid rock that&#39;s constantly being jostled around with a solid iron core that somehow maintains itself at the center of this spinning mass and held together by nothing more than the weakest force known. Gravity.<br><br>So, what happened to centrifugal/centripetal action here? I understand from the diagram and the definition given on this video that this three meter sphere contains a one meter solid metal (I would have to assume) core that is fixed in place so it can&#39;t move. Fair enough. It also contains several tons of molten sodium confined within the outer shell which rotates. At the very least, who&#39;s to say that there aren&#39;t huge voids within or just under earths&#39; mantle? Just curious.<br><br>Interesting video bye the bye. Oh, and this &#39;has never been done before&#39;? &#39;Ever&#39;.

You would get more current flowing in those spirals and those spirals would then be like coils of wire with current flowing through them which results in a magnetic field aligned along the spirals which are aligned with the earth&#39;s axis of rotation. Those convective spirals are essentially just giant inductors. If there was some kind of capacitive element connected to these inductors then you could get the magnetic field to oscillate like it has been observed to do so. The energy storage system wouldn&#39;t necessarily have to be capacitive, if the current induced by the collapsing magnetic field was converted to mechanical force then perhaps it could be stored in something that acts like a spring or perhaps as faster flowing liquid, which then gets converted back to current when the magnetic field stops driving the current.", "comment_date": "2018-07-15T10:13:04Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Mr Exists", "comment_text": "this guy is awesome, and seems to enjoy his job", "comment_date": "2018-07-15T10:10:49Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "deathoniza", "comment_text": "Isn&#39;t the IGRF predictive?", "comment_date": "2018-07-15T10:09:34Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Henric Andersson", "comment_text": "Arch reactor !", "comment_date": "2018-07-15T10:06:31Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "argon", "comment_text": "How does anybody &quot;know&quot; what the earth&#39;s &quot;core&quot; is made of -and what temperature it is?<br>&quot;Best guess&quot; is not fact, it&#39;s fiction, and basing &quot;science&quot; on this is questionable.", "comment_date": "2018-07-15T10:06:03Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "bitkarek", "comment_text": "i want to see a controlled explosion of a sodium with water :D", "comment_date": "2018-07-15T10:04:22Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Kacper", "comment_text": "as always Quality content.", "comment_date": "2018-07-15T10:00:55Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Floor Sixteen.", "comment_text": "I remember countries around world investing in trying to create a Sun...do you know anything about that?", "comment_date": "2018-07-15T09:57:48Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Coach Adam", "comment_text": "Trevor Noah it an unfunny jackass.", "comment_date": "2018-07-15T09:50:17Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Gustavo Morelos", "comment_text": "I love how Veritasium never pushes pseudoscience as facts and ends the video with \u201cit\u2019s still an open question.\u201d <br>Great informational video!
