There has been an interest in making a nuclear war look worse than it would be to support the MAD doctrine. One side want to make the weapons look worse than they are to the other side to scare them from starting a conflict while another group was interested in making the weapon look worse to their own population to make sure that their own side didn&#39;t start the war. However since none of the nuclear countries ever did any real attempt to educated their people in how to behave (duck and cover does not really cover it) the effect would actually be a lot worse than it had to be, so in a way it is a self-fulfilling prophecy and a way for both side to maximize the disaster.\u00a0Sweden and\u00a0Switzerland are the only countries that actually planed and prepared for a nuclear conflict by extremely ambitious project to protect their citizen. This was possible since they where among the few rich countries that did not have any interest in scaring it&#39;s own population from using the nukes, since they never got any. Sweden literally build ABC fallout shelter in basically every apartment house and\u00a0Switzerland build enormous ones in their mountains.
