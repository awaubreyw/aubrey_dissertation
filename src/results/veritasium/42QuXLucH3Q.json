Of course this is not always the case; I&#39;m only speaking of the tests which rely purely upon choice A or choice B, with no contributing factors. Most notably, the Pepsi taste challenge, or the monkey gender-based toy preference test, in which they offered the choice of a toy truck or a doll to monkeys of different genders, and the majority of females took the dolls, and males took the trucks. But due to the lack of options given, the test is indeterminable from pure coincidence, and exactly akin to flipping a coin. Furthermore, they&#39;re feral monkeys. In contrast to self aware humans with a countless number of factors that go into our decision making, as well as being raised in controlled environments, It&#39;s the very definition of comparing apples to oranges. <br><br>Another set of statistical data that has been sharply skewed, and even misread completely in order to fill a larger agenda-based narrative; would be much of that behind so-called female oppression in the west in the modern day. However, much of that has already been debunked. Although there are statistics that are still widely believed, such as the ones backing the concept of a &#39;rape culture&#39;. While I&#39;m not debating that adult women endure the horrible practice of rape more than adult men. For one, it is not as overwhelmingly one sided as it is made out to be, since the statistics for men having endured rape are very scant to begin with, and the majority of men, and even boys that have endured it, will never come forward to tell their stories, because of the societal pressure put on them to endure everything, and just man-up about it. Also the lack of male support (including lack of unisex, or men&#39;s abuse shelters) in our society. <br><br>Another point to make is that it&#39;s serial rapists that account for a large portion of rape cases. That said, painting it as a rape culture due to those statistics alone, is like stating that we live in a murder culture because of serial killers, then using that as another method to berate men (most of which would never even consider such a thing).<br><br>That said, statistics are a very important tool for intellectual growth, but it&#39;s important to always check the source, subjects, and methods used in any given statistic before taking it in as &#39;fact&#39;.", "comment_date": "2022-05-31T05:46:32Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Elijah Franklin", "comment_text": "Statistics shouldn&#39;t be called a math.

Is not scientists who decide it&#39;s the extremely wealthy business elites and politicians or in other words lawyers and businessmen and the worst kind at that, so again in other words greedy and power hungry pathological liars. For example the justice system will not allow science to determine a person&#39;s guilt in a crime. Criminal investigation is not allowed to call what they do science they have to take advantage of a loophole and call it &quot;forensic sciences&quot;. Just about the only thing they use that has any backing in science is DNA. Lie detectors are not backed by science, blood splatter pattern is not backed by science, even there fingerprint analysis is not backed by science. Laws and regulation are created by false science or no science and the people appointed to create these laws and regulations are those who need regulated in the first place. For example Dupont has been polluting the world with Teflon for decades on top of decades now. When this was brought to the attention of the powers that be Dupont was taken to court. Dupont was then let off with no charges and no fines because it was determined through scientific study that the levels of Teflon that Dupont had been dumping and the levels of Teflon that would be dangerous for the human body and other living things we&#39;re not high enough to cause any problems. Yet DuPont was the exact establishment appointed the responsibility of doing the research and creating the regulations in the first place. Teflon is called an Infinity chemical meaning the human body cannot ever break it down once it enters your body it stays there forever. Every time regulations need to be put in place the government requests that that the largest companies on the planet associated with the subject in question do the studies and experimentsand make their own conclusions of what these regulations should be and you better believe the scientists who do these studies better make sure the conclusion comes out exactly the way that company wants it to come out or they will be fired and discredited and will never get a job again. And even if an academic establishment like Harvard Yale or Cambridge or any academic establishment for that matter is asked to do the studies the same rules apply because those schools are owned by the same people that own those huge corporations. In fact you could probably Trace every single regulation ever made back to two companies named Black Rock and vanguard. These two companies own the majority holdings of just about every company on the planet. And that extends to private companies that are thought to be Federal as in the Federal reserve, every single jail, and all the companies contracted by the CIA, NSA, all military branches, and every single other alphabet establishment in the federal government for all nations. As in these people are pretty much their own judge jury executioner defendant plaintiff and lawmakers. So they make the laws determine their own guilt over these laws determine their own punishment if they even decide that they are guilty of something usually for public image, and they control whether or not you hear about it or not or even if you&#39;re allowed to hear about it or not.", "comment_date": "2022-04-08T20:01:35Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "yonatan ran", "comment_text": "is that why you made videos using wrong research about meat?", "comment_date": "2022-04-01T15:00:10Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Dave Stuart: Weekly Videos for Teachers", "comment_text": "Wow.

No one would consider giving you a post doc position without being published 5-10 times, and you are unlikely to get a tenure track position without being published 30 or so times. And speaking as a grad student who worked on a couple major projects, it is impossible to be published thirty times in your life and have meaningful data. The modern scientific process takes years. It takes months of proposal writing, followed by months of modeling, followed by months or years of experimentation, followed by months of pouring over massive data sets.

Halfway through it, I got hungry so I left it playing and went to the kitchen to fix myself a sandwich. But then I found out that I&#39;m out of mayonnaise so I went to a store. There, I saw the most beautiful woman I have ever seen in my whole life. But I&#39;m a really shy person so I took up a three-year personality development course so I could introduce myself. She was very friendly and all, but unfortunately, she had a boyfriend. So I said, all good, I&#39;m a mature person. I wanted the best for her and I harbored no illusion that I am the best person for her and she seemed happy with her boyfriend, so I didn&#39;t bother her anymore. But we kept in touch and we became friends and I got over my crush on her. Then she broke up with her boyfriend, we drank some alcohol because of it. I told her she&#39;ll be fine and I wished her well. I still think she&#39;s the most beautiful woman in the world, but like I said, I am over my crush on her. It was like five years already since I first saw her. Besides, I am quite happy with the friendship I developed with her. It was more important than a crush. So we kept hanging out, drinking, having coffee, and all. I had a girlfriend, she started dating other guys. My girlfriend wanted to live some other life without me in it, so I said, &quot;Okay, I want the best for you and I want you to pursue your happiness.&quot; My lady friend and I drank alcohol about it, and she gave me the same advice I gave her when she was in that position and I became okay with the breakup immediately. But we were really drunk, so she spent the night in my apartment. I only have one bed, so you know what that means: She took the bed and I slept on the couch. But on the couch, I really can&#39;t sleep. Something was bothering me. So I tossed and turned for about three hours, then I finally couldn&#39;&#39;t take it anymore, I stood up and went straight to my room where she&#39;s sleeping. I approached the bed, gently sat on it and I reached for her shoulder to pull her closer to me. She stirred and woke up. She asked what&#39;s up. I told her, &quot;you know, the first time I saw you, I was watching a video and left it playing to get myself a sandwich then went to the store to get some mayo then I got so distracted by life that I forgot to finish the video.&quot; She said, &quot;You know what, I&#39;ve been wondering about a weird noise in your night drawer.&quot; So we opened that drawer, and lo and behold, there&#39;s my phone and this video still has two minutes of play time on it.", "comment_date": "2021-09-05T00:31:16Z", "likes_count": 2}, {"comment_by": "inappropriately aligned metaphorical nourishment", "comment_text": "if people could see into the future, there would be no point for the success rate to be only 53%. if you have such a skill, how would it be possible for you to fail so hard at using that skill that you fail 47% of the time?", "comment_date": "2021-09-04T21:49:35Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "MsHellokitty666", "comment_text": "the simple truth is that people are plain lazy and like to eat chocolate.", "comment_date": "2021-09-04T19:12:26Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "ahmet mutlu", "comment_text": "statistics is part of sciene. but tis blind research technique. its  values are no way directly acceptable as scienific result. but they are useful for where to look for the sources of answers for technically identifiable mechanism.", "comment_date": "2021-09-04T17:07:23Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Tom (Edge of Thought Ideas)", "comment_text": "From a truth-fact purist, the content in this video really is dangerous to the 2021 political-medicine movements of establishment.", "comment_date": "2021-09-04T16:41:51Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Shota Toriumi", "comment_text": "The barbarous grape immunologically listen because retailer similarly race as a slim find. panoramic, handy february", "comment_date": "2021-09-04T14:30:43Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Tuxido", "comment_text": "9.99m subs", "comment_date": "2021-09-04T14:10:49Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "AVClarke", "comment_text": "<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42QuXLucH3Q&amp;t=3m29s\">3:29</a> &quot;Or if the researchers are biased.&quot; All researchers are biased, there is no &#39;if&#39;.

The scientific method follows from axioms of probability so it should work and indeed we observe it working, but ultimately it&#39;s only a special case and there are other ways of knowing (all other ways of knowing that follow from probability axioms). Scientists themselves routinely flout the scientific method in certain situations and in many of these cases they are entirely correct to do so! Say, the first time Newtonian physics made a new prediction was the location of as-of-yet undiscovered Neptune: lack of new predictions is in terrible contradiction of the scientific method as currently understood - for this reason it&#39;s not even properly falsifiable - but people (correctly) accepted his theories. The exact same could be said about Darwin-Wallace theory of evolution for example: no testable predictions (in contrast to modern  mathematically robust theory of evolution that does). Or, most scientists today refuse to strongly believe in ESP almost no matter how many and how rigorous experiments parapsychology manages to produce following the common practices of the scientific method (they could even be viewed as pioneers of rigor, following demands of sceptics).<br><br>The reasons you can do this are all the other ways of knowing following from axioms of probability. Newton&#39;s theory of gravity didn&#39;t make any new predictions for the longest time but it was ELEGANT, capable of explaining the known observations at least as well as any other known explanation, but can be presented in a equation of just several terms. People at the time didn&#39;t know off Kolmogorov complexity or Solomonoff&#39;s induction, but they intuitively surmised the simplicity of his theory was a great merit of Newton&#39;s. Conversely, people now have (thanks to our scientific worldview) formed a very strong prior against the existence of  ESP: the required physical mechanisms seem implausible, if you input the estimated fitness advantage to population genetics equations the chance of fixation is ~0, nobody has managed to purposefully use ESP in presence of a magician... The studies could have p=.0000000000000001 and due to inherent improbability of the phenomenon, we (with almost utter certainty correctly) conclude the result is more likely a result of deliberate deception, flaws in the study, or even us misunderstanding the paper, rather than any actual ESP being observed.<br><br>And these ways of knowing aren&#39;t limited to believing Newtonian gravity or disbelieving ESP. A perfectly rational agent could run circles around science, even idealized science with no p-hacking or publication bias (they&#39;d still need to perform experiments and run analyses of course, but could to large extent cut ahead of the scientific process and insitutions), and in practice very boundedly rational humans can have a pretty good batting average in deciding what purported science to believe. So it&#39;s not that science is the best way of knowing, it&#39;s the best SYSTEMATIC way of knowing given very bounded rationality of humans, placing limits on how much one making the claim can massage the results, and that performs ON AVERAGE better than other methods: people aren&#39;t acting in full accordance with the scientific method when they say &quot;I disbelieve this ESP study with p=.000001 and no replication-study that seems to falsify it&quot;, but the method of following where your personal rationality leads you to also produces beliefs such as &quot;Earth is flat&quot; or &quot;modern CRT monitors are a cancer risk worth being concerned about&quot;.", "comment_date": "2021-08-23T08:29:15Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Katie Barber", "comment_text": "as long as capitalism allows people to starve for lack of money, scientists and everyone will always be vulnerable to being &quot;bought&quot;. remove the need for money to survive and people are free to be honest and work toward the common good, rather than just being able to eat", "comment_date": "2021-08-23T05:35:38Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Aktuell Y\u0101ttee", "comment_text": "stupid scientists", "comment_date": "2021-08-23T02:20:40Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "NeutronicalGaming", "comment_text": "ALMOST EVERY knowledge is wrong, in that it is incomplete, inaccurate or just conceptually flawed. perfection and absolute accuracy are hard marks to meet, so this is not surprising at all.", "comment_date": "2021-08-22T23:04:32Z", "likes_count": 4}, {"comment_by": "M LEET", "comment_text": "Great, now let&#39;s apply this to all the &quot;extensive&#39;&#39; research for the covid ameliorite (it isn&#39;t a vaccine, just makes you feel less bad).<br><br>Oh wait, they have too much money to lose if it&#39;s too closely analyzed.", "comment_date": "2021-08-22T22:12:47Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Rob", "comment_text": "And THIS is why I utterly laugh at all the people who reflexively scream, &quot;trust science!!!&quot;.

By backend I&#39;d refer to the actual scientific work. It will have false positives and negatives, there&#39;ll be frauds, bias and accidental failures. <br><br>This gets multiplied in the mid-end, the publishing part.

This layer has very little scientific interest. Here we get clickbait, financial incentives, ideology, politics and everything else deciding what we actually get to see.

Most political daruma backed by statistics today can be summed up by people making deliberately erroneous assumptions of causation based on association alone. The problem with this is that ones imagination is the limit as to the conclusions that can be drawn. For example if statistics show gender inequalities at a given institution, they will just assume the cause is discrimination even when there are alternative, more plausible explanations, which there usually are.

A major problem with science these days is the dictatorial nature of orthodoxy and the political motivations behind it. People should remember that the Church did not pressure Galileo to recant his support for the Copernican theory because they believed the earth had to be the center of the universe (quite the opposite, that part is myth), it is because they had based doctrine on the best science of the day. Galileo was an outlier, accepted science contradicted his views -- telescopes were just coming into use. The point being that the &quot;best&quot; science of today has political forces supporting it that squelch research, and curbs independent analysis. The two areas that leap out are climatology and genetics.

People are so afraid that this myth that racial distinctions are a &quot;social construct&quot; will be blown apart by genetic research (it already has to be fair), that they will do whatever necessary to silence people in that area, and to discourage work.

(we can make opaque metrics and use intrinsic metrics like curiosity to hinder the hacking, but the agent finds a way).

A reinforcement learning agent can learn to exploit a glitch in the simulation engine to get a higher score. The point is, if we act greedy and there is at least a small chance of trying most things (an epsilon soft policy) then we will find optimal behavior at some point, which is, behavior that maximizes the reward received. This can be exploiting a loophole or changing the reward function altogether! Is there a general way to formulate a Markov decision process where the agent will not exploit false positive reward signals, for which it will lead to higher reward but not optimal behavior? Even more, is there a general method to specify a reward in which the agent will follow the desired behavior, or at least bounds around this specification? We don&#39;t know yet.

But, what is quite common, I believe, are two things. First of all, virtually all scientist I know, including myself, do not have a sufficient statistical training. Big second, the incentives in academic research are wrong, massively wrong and the mechanism how funding is allocated is deeply problematic. There are efforts to improve the situation, but many colleagues are still oblivious to the problem or are somehow aware but just don\u00b4t care, or, of course, actively exploit and sustain the problems, because they benefit, after all, researchers are humans. And it is tough even if you try to do everything right, publish or perish is real, and if you concentrate on replication or even only on repeatability of your own work, your chances of actually staying employed in academic research are not likely increasing. I once tried to publish a surprise finding of a certain material property we found by chance. Instead of making the material only once, we made it 5 times, and found, not surprisingly, some important deviations. When I submitted to peer review, one reviewer recommended that our work is not ready for publication, because we had reproducibility issues. If we had never repeated the synthesis 4 more times and only did it once, no doubt the reviewer would have had no issue, as that is the standard in our field (I know how crazy that must sound for colleagues in other fields, believe me). What I am trying to do now, when I give presentations and talk about this work, I point out this issue very clearly, but what you take from this as your take home message??

It is based on balancing type I error (false positives - what p measures) with type II error (false negatives - measured by power or beta). If you decrease type I error to be more certain, you automatically increase type II error, sometimes massively. In typical psych experiments the probability of a type II error -- using p &lt; .05 as a cut-off (or &quot;alpha&quot;) -- is generally around 15% - if you decrease the acceptable p-value, the probability of type II error will increase far beyond 15% - also not good.

Some true positive results shouldn&#39;t be considered as such when you make an in detail analysis of their methods, statistics and final findings just for the pure reason that, mid-study, some parts of the objetive were changed to accomodate the findings. This is also an issue that pisses me off, especially in my research field where there&#39;s such a huge mix of different scientific areas that it&#39;s next to impossible to verify anything at all in detail because everyone just pulls the results their way.<br>And as some people mentioned here, some people do withold critical pieces of information for citation boosts. If people can&#39;t reproduce something from a study, they can neither be proved wrong by the paper&#39;s information alone (as long as it checks out in theory) nor can they be denied autorships and citations from other papers which effectively boosts their &#39;worth&#39;. The fact that researchers are evaluated using citations/autorship numbers is also one of the leading problems as to which false-positives exists in such large numbers (I don&#39;t believe false-positives are only ~30% for a damn second, but this is my biased opinion) and why some papers, even though everything checks out in theory, can never be truly reviewed on a p2p manner on the practical results sides of things.<br><br>Anyone who works in research knows there&#39;s a lot of... misbehaving on most published works, regardless of the results.

As invaluable a resource as this is, I can&#39;t help but want to push back on the one part of the video which was just a little too cute; the scientific method is not the most reliable way of knowing that we have. Indeed, it cannot be - we know some things with analytic incorrigibility, and others with existential indubitability, and still more with more mundane ways of knowing (and these, more often than any other, afford us the foundational assumptions on which any confidence in science itself must be based, for science is permeated with assumptions of this variety which fall strictly outside of its scope). What you should have said, I think, is that science is the most reliable method we have of forming beliefs about the natural world (in particular, natural nomological regularities). That isn&#39;t as cute, and it is a bit of a mouthful, but it has the advantage of not being false. <br><br>What I would really like to see you explore, perhaps in the future, is whether some researchers approach science in such a way that they think P-hacking not merely expedient, but ethically imperative. If one is animated by a desire for the good more than for the true (perhaps especially if they are structural realists or constructive empiricists, or anti-realists of closely related varieties), and one regards science as a means to a promised land provided by a religious or political ideology (I&#39;m thinking here especially, though not exclusively, of progressivism, critical theory, intersectionality, post-modern neo-Marxism, or any other name which is used for roughly the very same ideology), then it seems P-hacking your way to a conclusion in support of public policy positions you think morally imperative will be so highly motivated as to be inevitable, which may then, when unearthed, erode public confidence in science (as an institution more than as a method). For instance, consider Heather Douglas&#39; argument in &quot;Inductive Risk and Values in Science*\r&quot; (you can find the PDF with a <a href=\"http://scholar.google/\">Scholar.Google</a> search) and what that attitude might engender in the sciences if accepted by any significant fraction of practicing scientists.", "comment_date": "2020-10-20T22:17:25Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Walter Zagieboylo", "comment_text": "Just the scientific method shows that all results are tentative.

This major problem is also mixed with  the fallacy that innovations produce like popcorn! You have to invest your time, while having controversial or bad results for a good amount of time, until you find the tone, and find the path to truly innovate. If you continue to test too much you get focused on little details, and spread yourself to thin. However, that can be controversial, testing is the best way to gauge if there is any substance to your hypothesis or not. When one first starts out in research, it can be very brutal because you will be wrong, and wrong, then wrong... \r<br>\r<br>Which makes us think &quot;We are Not born for this.&quot; But, the truth is that last quote that I stated is actually wrong. What does &#39;being born to do something&#39; have anything to do with your job in life? I think the problem is from being bombarded with the TV. And, what is the authority of television? Hollywood. So what idiot made Hollywood King? This group has very serious problems, does not know a thing about reality, is so far from the mainstream, most are drunks, and with very serious drug problems. Additionally, the people who grow up in this group end up, bang up crazy (Miley Cyrus, Lindsay Lohan, Olson twins ...).\r<br>\r<br>From the bombardment of television, we are wired with a false sense of right and wrong, and how to achieve success. Everything does not have to look good to continue, and to be successful in the future. And, A lot of people will tell you it did Not happen that way. But do you know what plans to fall too when you don&#39;t know what to do? I could go down a different tangent where a guy talked about how he had success of &#39;Fake it to make it.&#39; So when Hollywood gives advice, I would not believe it, remember they are just acting. In reality, Hollywood does Not even pursue it.\r<br>\r<br>Also, school is exceedingly secular, but looks good on a resume. I have a very hard time believing that 80% of people are stupid because they do Not have a degree. This compounding problem is continuing to be solved by a not so smart solution: &#39;Just adding to the work load.&#39; However, the neural concepts that are being exercised in school are very minimal. There seems to be a huge focus on our brains memory, but what about creativity, planning, leadership, critical thinking, problem solving ... And does school really do a good job with our brains memory? Most people forget the information a month after the semester ends. Anyways, I guess that is why some people think &quot;We only use 10% of our brain!&quot; Or why employers think of a degree as a first hurdle, and then the real training starts to begin. Or why real innovators, like Elon Musk, did not finish their degree, and thought of better options.\r<br>\r<br>I think a good test would be to have two people as interns learning to be a doctor.

I suggest everyone go and read Ioannidis&#39; original paper and then read the brilliant response paper by Goodman and Greenland (2007), which highlights the logical and mathematical errors made by Ioannidis. Ioannidis then responded to that paper but I do not find his follow up to be convincing.<br><br>The first issue with this video is the misunderstanding of p-values. &quot;How much of the published research literature is false? The intuitive answer seems to be 5%.&quot; No. This would only be true if the average p-value of all research results was 0.05. In reality, most published research finds p-values much lower than 0.05. In fact, a p-value of 0.05 should only be taken at face value if the p-value is not controversial... If you had a study that found peaches cure cancer and your relevant p-value was 0.049, this would warrant close scrutiny.<br><br>Another issue is that this video is misleading about what replication entails. You seem to think that replication is something that is done after a study is published, by a different set of researchers. This definitely can be the case, but a robust study has replication built into it. This is especially true for medical research. You study multiple samples and compare the results with eachother.

Also there are some really bad actors mixed in, who intentionally either falsify test results or keep promoting research already claimed false for some messed up agenda, fame and fortune. Particularly Japan &amp; the USA has been active in this endeavor<br>.<br>Slightly beside the topic:<br>.<br>I recently read a study done by EU&#39;s anti-racism unit. Reason for this was, that they genuinely tried to claim Finland was the most racist country, I mean really, honestly trying to say Finland is the most racist country? Funny how it is also at the same time the top 3 safest, least corrupted and happiest country, yet somehow would be the most racist as well? Somethings just didn&#39;t add up<br>.<br>After looking into the organization, which seemed extremely biased to find racism and mistreatment everywhere, since their whole organization was basically about it, I looked at the actual research which they claimed to be this and that approved. But even a brief glance showed up gross problems with the methods used.<br>.<br>- It was a study on a variety of different countries with very different populations and ethnic makeups<br>- It was conducted very differently in each country, and mostly by an online survey with extremely suggestive questions<br>- There was an extremely high number of questions, and many of them were not only suggestive, but extremely vague and open ended. With questions like: do you feel people treat you differently. do you feel you have less job opportunities because you do not speak the native language<br>- the target groups were not randomized and sample sized were extremely small. Also, in some countries target was 2nd or 3rd+ gen immigrants, while in others 1st gen immigrants<br>.<br>For example, in Estonia, every single person in the survey was Estonian citizen with Russian heritage. They make 50% of the country&#39;s populace and are also Caucasian like Estonians (who also are part Slavic), then on the other hand in Finland, that they found to be the most racist country by a large margin. They used an online query to a total of 502 people, and all of them were 1st gen Somali refugees (not immigrants or even citizens) in a country with completely different education standards and already high unemployment rate, and they did not even speak the language. And they had excluded all other ethnic groups and backgrounds from the survey<br>.<br>Anyone should be able to understand that those two survey results are not comparable since not only are there deep problems in the reliability of that data, they are not even remotely comparable in almost any way<br>.<br>I wish important topics like there would be properly researched, and proper solutions could be found to improve the situation of everyone in the best way possible. Not by making low value, unscientific research with a confirmation bias just to bolster the organizations own agenda, since some people actually believe these studies without making any effort to double check on the used methods. As stated in this video, since making trash research papers isn&#39;t actually penalized, only failing to produce one of sufficient scandal/hype value, they will keep on coming, and the worst part is, that it will make all research seem very unreliable when there is constantly so much false positive research coming up", "comment_date": "2020-07-03T10:57:58Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "kuzuboshii", "comment_text": "But we&#39;re NOT trying our best.

I think magazines should reward reviewers and require reliable reviews. Magazines charge a fee for publishing an article and then for accessing the same article. I may not have access to the article I published myself if the University doesn&#39;t have access to a given journal. Scientists do it as it is said for prestige and possibly discounts on the price of publishing their articles in a given journal. (this note regards some journals, in fact the most prestigious) This is a description from the perspective of physical sciences, maybe researchers from other fields have different thoughts.

This relates to everything - from the Inflation Theory, Higgs Model, Particle Physics (standard model), General Relativity, Special Relativity and the Nobel Prize Winner Dr. Riess and the Type 1a Supernova (SN1a) distances measurements. SN1a are used for calibration of the Cosmological Ruler d(z) or distance versus redshift.<br><br>SN1a detonates when they reach the Chandrasekhar Mass Limit and that has a G^{-3/2} . This means that in a model where G is epoch-dependent, the SN1a have to be adjusted to comply with that. They cannot behave as Stellar Candles.

Mahoney of Pennsylvania State University, was one of the first to examine how well the peer review process works in evaluating scientific papers. In a landmark stud he sent copies of one paper to 75 reviewers but doctored the results so that in some cases the research appeared to support mainstream theories, while in others it ran against them.<br>&quot;When the results ran contrary to the reviewer&#39;s theoretical beliefs,&quot; Mahoney reported, &quot;the procedures were berated and the manuscript was rejected. When the results &#39;confirmed&#39; the reviewers beliefs, the same procedures were lauded and the manuscript was recommended for publication.&quot;<br>Mahoney&#39;s findings struck a nerve. Within three months after he presented his results last year at a meeting of the American Association for the Advancement of Science, he said, he &quot;received probably 200 to 300 letters and phone calls from scientists who felt they had been victims of that kind of discrimination.&quot;<br>This underscores an even greater problem, as uncomfortable arguments regardless of their basis in fact are not only shunned by individual academics, but also by the very provisos of the professional journals that represent their collective opinion.

I consider your channel to be one of the best science channels on youtube (if not the best one) because it touches exactly a neglected point in the academic world today: intuition. It&#39;s not only about technical experiments but also the reasoning behind and the understanding/intuition involved. This specific video now shows exactly one of the big flaws in the scientific world today besides the &quot;publication competition&quot; and touches also a very sensitive point that I saw in some very good world known universities: lack of skepticism. Unfortunately people seem to get more and more ready to research what is already given and less prone to question &quot;known truths&quot;. In that sense, my intention with this message, is to raise you the question about the whole climate change story. I saw your old video about it and also agree in many terms with it, but I still have the strong feeling that this whole hyisteria is much more political and ideological as it is scientific. This video here has a very interesting point that would be very interesting to mix with the climate change topic as maybe some of the &quot;known facts and studies&quot; may also fall in to this research problem. I&#39;m not saying the climate is not changing or the CO2 is not raising, nor that one doesn&#39;t affect the other, but as a skeptic, i think there are still many fundamental links missing or at least lacking scientific proof in order to be so sure about the future of our world, especially when we still don&#39;t entirely understand and dominate the climate system.

I&#39;m an MD and while we studied all these criteria for statistical analysis, unbiased scientific study design, etc., this particular phenomenon was never mentioned (that I recall) at my medical school.  Interestingly, it corresponds to a concept we use in evaluating testing modalities called Positive Predictive Value, meaning the likelihood that if someone tests positive for a disease that they actually have that disease.  Unlike Sensitivity and Specificity (the false positive and false negative rates), which remain the same for a given test regardless of disease prevalence, the PPV is hugely influenced by the prevalence of a disease in a population.

It is a genuine concern that we all should have. And it&#39;s reflected in our political culture so much, there actually was a need for that end-commentary: Science is still the most reliable way, it&#39;s just not as reliable as we normally think. <br>There is a crisis of faith in science and it&#39;s partially right. We are shifting awareness and some people will automatically shift all the way to the other side of the spectrum before eventually ending up shifted only a very small way from the starting point.<br><br>In software development we saw and see a similar crisis with the growing amount of dependencies. We tend to build software with more and more dependencies, because it&#39;s way faster to innovate this way. And this way programmers get to use the results of stuff, they do not really understand creatively. But we are also relying on other developers more and more and are unable to fix errors that will inevitably crop up in dependencies more and more. This problem multiplies quickly because of the layering of dependencies. Because of the way the things we depend upon are constructed in turn. Since it is quite unrewarding to do the original programming of the basics again and again, even the libraries you depend upon have dependencies, the language the library is written in has dependencies etc. All the way down to machine code level and even beyond that in the way the chips are constructed. It basically means that the guy who writes your software can not keep your business operational and you can not expect him to bear that responsibility AND have prices that are competitive. The military had to dismiss whole fleets of warships, because the operating system they ran on was no longer supported. It is cheaper for companies to move away and reinvent than to upkeep legacy software. Dependency management and awareness of the involved risks for security and stability is our quite shoddy fix of this when software needs to be somewhat reliable, like in a car.. It is the reason that the public rightly distrusts self-driving cars, even though we already have self driving airplanes and we can show AI is better at driving that humans are by now.<br>It means the trend in business models have been divided between 1. quick fixes for problems that are really short lived or 2. to keep hot-fixing software and spot problems continuously at enormous cost and eventually abandon the software. <br>These days none of your software outlives your computer. Not even the operating system (it is continuously hot-fixed). That&#39;s a concern, because the normal write-off for a computer system is 2 years. But if you turn on an old pong-game console. It will work as perfectly as it did 25 years ago..  The only problem might be the hardware. This will not be true for most of the software written today. In 5 years time you will not be able to get it up and running any more.<br>It also means that we start walking by continuously falling forward. Which is only a problem if you suddenly stop. We need to keep innovating always to keep existing as a company. Else we will have competitors breathing down our necks. There is hardly time for a re-write or optimisation or rethink the core that actually makes the software useful in the first place..<br>Sure we have reusable code and use seperation of concerns etc.. as best practices.. but your wordprocessor still doesn&#39;t crash less than twenty years ago and it is still a nice vector for virusses..  Even though computers are now more than 10.000 times more powerful. Where has all this power gone?<br>And by now, we seem to have all but lost the ability to write reliable code and we have &quot;fixed&quot; this problem by how we look at  the reliability of software.. Software has become a short-lived tool. We expect not to use what we use today in two years time. And because we shifted expectations, it is not really a problem, just a pet-peeve.<br><br>And the same is becoming true in science, where new theories are based on old studies. Science has many dependencies often extending to different area&#39;s, like all science relies on math, but mostly scientists aren&#39;t mathematicians. All science relies on observation, but hardly any scientist study the psychology of observation (and the limitations) in stead, we have best practices..<br>This is why there is such a mistrust of information at the moment, this is the factual basis of &quot;fake news&quot; and &quot;flat earthers&quot; trends. Doesn&#39;t mean that isn&#39;t a wrong way of looking at things, it just a point of view that keeps cropping up, the reliability of fact and science is viewed as more shoddy and temporal. <br><br>Now looking at what happened to the computer industry, we can reliably say that this is not per se a bad thing. <br>But we were so used to the rethoric of science being the end-of-all discussion.  Science has the answer.. That is so hard to let go of, because it seemed so safe.. It has never been completely true and is now just more obviously not true. We will find a new balance with this new view of fact and science. <br>And finding a balance is always a bit rocky.<br>It is interesting that a medium like youtube actually has a big role to play in this.

When enough additional observations are made errors in any and all theories are discovered. Those theories are then changed or modified to fit the new observations and then those changed or modified theories are tested with even more observations. The cycle NEVER ends. <br><br><br><br>The earth is flat fits some simple observations. But additional observations find that the earth is really spherical. But then there are variations on that sphere. Etc. Or, early explanations of motion explained some simple observations. Then Newton had better observations and developed a better theory. It worked a lot better. But Einstein found that Newton was wrong. Now others are finding the errors in Einstein&#39;s theories. Etc. It never ends. And NONE of the published results are &quot;correct&quot;.

Research is not noted for good science but for positive results. <br><br><br>The New York Times a couple of years ago ran a story about three weeks before Thanksgiving saying that a new study said that eating nuts was beneficial.... and went on to list &#39;nuts&#39; including cashews, peanuts and one other none-nut seed. I could picture moms, grandmothers, maybe a few grandfathers, seeing this article and adding an extra can or jar of mixed nuts to their Thanksgiving food shopping. I called BS in the comments as did a few other people. All of these comments disappeared.  This is just lazy journalism. There&#39;s a whole &#39;food chain&#39; of bad science. One factor beyond your report is what type of research gets noticed? Exercise is good for you?  or Sitting with your feet up reduces risk of cardiovascular   disease by 17%? Beer lowers cholesterol. And which type gets added to widely disseminated press releases? Filtered water is healthier, or Diet soda is considered as effective as water for rehydration? <br>The Sackler family turned one scientific paper with a counterintuitive and dubious finding into an Oxycontin dope empire. <br>While I&#39;m noodling away into empty digital space. I&#39;d like to predict that one of the reasons psychological studies have such a low repeatability rate is not because they&#39;re wrong, but because it is in any organism&#39;s interest to be unpredictable. Behaviorism is a subset of psychology, Skinner dialed it in and now we&#39;re mostly seeing all the amazing variations of his work, along with the interesting ways psychology can screw up behavior. (Dan Arely&#39;s At some point more pay  achieves worse results investigation is a classic example ).

If you say science tells us which methods to use, then you&#39;re arguing in a circle. You&#39;re using scientific methods to prove the reliability of scientific methods. So if science can tell us anything at all, there MUST be at least SOME things we know APART from science. Well, no conclusion can be more certain than the premises upon which it is based.

If you&#39;re thinking of a number between 1 and 10, you know directly and immediately which number you&#39;re thinking of, and you know it with absolute certainty. We know that if two statements contradict each other, they can&#39;t both be true. We know that two plus two is four. We know that if straight lines intersect, opposite angles will be equal. We know all these things merely by thinking about them. We can sit in a dark room with our eyes closed and merely reflect on these things and know with certainty that they are true without ever engaging in any scientific methods.

The scientists are still afterall people, and often coming from all walks of life. There is also a huge push for the teachers and professors to publish papers to stay on the job, or get any kind of economic boost and things. Problem is not everyone in the field of science and education is INTO research, not everyone is taught statistics, and most are really interested in research only as it is needed to be done to stay in the job. Some may just be interested in teaching, some may just be interested in administration of a said department and so on. Yet, I have seen from many of people I know of, they have to publish papers and have to do it just for the sake of their job, which is teaching. There is no grant for the research but huge requirements to publish something. There is also this need to conduct a dissertation level research by the post graduate trainees, who are just coming into the stream from most likely a &quot;never done research before&quot; background. Now it is true they need to learn research and all, but the fact is that these people are often junior in the department , has to learn the subject, work extra hours, are most unexposed to research and so on, and has to conduct this research in order to be able to sit for the final exam for which they need to study their ass off. Why do you think there is plagiarism and lots and lots of studies which are done poorly?  <br>If only the research was separated from the large swathes of unwilling teachers and administrative people, and many who just wants a masters in something to land a job, then the researches would be done by people who are really interested in it, and do it passionately. There should also be some grants in most fields for those who want to conduct the added task or the complex researches.<br>By separating the research from the teaching and administrations, and by reducing the load from the post graduate trainee, I do not mean to say abolish the scopes for these people.<br>I mean to say is, make it voluntary. Make it an incentive of promotion and extra grant perhaps, but maybe not the survival factor. Fewer people would be so sleazy to make a false or low quality paper on something or to p hack into significance, in order to land their hand over a research grant or some career boost or further scopes for research for more grants and things; THAN IF you put all people in a position to &quot;Either conduct a research that is going to be published and it better be new else good luck with it being published&quot; OR &quot;get fired, get a job in local grocery stores, move out into pooerer neighborhood and let your family suffer, yourself suffer, and your dog die because you can not afford the vaccines&quot;.<br>Most would still try to be honest, but many in the education fields, are doing the researches out of compulsion while trying to earn their livelihoods, and dealing with life like everyone else, and some of them are bound to slip up or just be dishonest even.<br>I will give you a scenario: Put 100 people with academic qualifications in 100 hotel rooms  with food and water being supplied, letting them know that they have exactly seven days to completely come up with a imaginary data set and false result and study for a paper, if they are to live and also would like their families to live.  <br>Now, it may so happen that all 100 would be so upstanding about the scientific method and &quot;truth&quot; that they would not in their conscience write a false thing, but I do suspect heavily that it will actually be 100. Some will slip.<br>This hypothetical scenario is extreme, but what is being done is also not as extreme. Most are not doing it on volition, but the reason for doing this lies in the system and human motivations. <br>Now put the same 100 people in their trainee years of postgrads, or in their jobs, where they need to do the researches AND publish them to get their degree and keep  their job. Now, most would probably would not go so low as to fabricate data and knowingly publish false stuff, but if the stakes are to &quot;get the degree that your future depends on, and oh you have to study this complicated subject that is unknown to you cause you are a traineee&quot; OR &quot;not get fired&quot;...most would rather &quot;reinterpret&quot; the data, or take a few more samples, or just would not stay up till 4 to learn the bit of statistics on their own so that they can be sure about the result and conclusions are actually &quot;for science!!!&quot;.<br><br><br>This is not to downplay the need of research. It should just be done by those who are into that matter. Research is something that would add to our existing knowledge. Common sense tells it should be done by people who would want to add to our existing knowledge and be motivated by it. But as we are a bunch of great apes, we found that the best way to make people do it is by making it compulsory for some jobs, which are not always populated by the &quot;people who want to add to our existing knowledge&quot;.<br><br><br>TL: DR: Too many uninterested and unmotivated and possibly unwilling people are forced to conduct research as a part of degree, or requirement to keep their jobs. If research was more focused on actual research motivated people and more money was in it, it would produce less amount of quantity, but great degree of quality.

Even a PhD does not make a thief an honest man. Many up-and-coming scientists push their way up by making data look much better than they actually are \u2014 standard operating procedure.\u201d<br><br>Another one relates, \u201cOnce, while working for a private research institute, I observed data that had heen \u2018fudged\u2019. I had heen assigned the task of reproducing some materials for a company that had paid for research and development of this material. When I was unable to reproduce these materials, I went back to the laboratory record book and found that the original raw data and proper calculations would not produce the physical properties of the materials originally reported.&quot;<br><br>\u201cAnother time, I overheard a colleague suggest that test data from a particular specimen be thrown away because it did not compare favorably with the other test data.\u201d<br><br>And still another scientist says, \u201cFudging data is hardly new to science. There is evidence that Isaac Newton \u2018cleaned up\u2019 some of his optics data when it did not fit his theories. That alteration of data and suppression of alternative theories held back the development of optics.

Assuming all positive results are published (#4), there have to be c.a 14 negative results published [125 * NRPR / (1-NRPR)=13,8]. Overall 139 (80+14+45) published. Now, among all negative results there are 20 false negative [N*RTH*(1-APT)] whis is ~2,2% of all negative results and 855 true negative [N*(1-RTH)*(1-p)] which is 97,8% of all negative results, so among those 14 published negative results we shouldn&#39;t expect any false negative (2,2% * 14 = 0,31).

My impression is that many researchers who have only studied introductory statistics have these powerful tools at their disposal, but neither the sense nor experience to know which empirical decisions to make regarding their use, let alone how to eliminate their own biases.<br><br> One example. A paper I recently read, purported to show that Aluminium as an adjuvant in vaccines causes autism. They actually went so far as to claim a causal relationship. The paper was almost incomprehensibly thick with jargon, but this just means that it had to be read many times (or maybe that I&#39;m a bit thick). The first bit of stats was a regression line with r =0.98 or so, showing the relationship between immunisation numbers and autism numbers. So far so good. Only I&#39;m already thinking, well, these are all from developed countries, many other things have happened which may correlate with autism, we (or I at least) don&#39;t know that autism was not previously present but is now being diagnosed more frequently, and no one knows what third world rates are. And do all vaccines from the period use Al as an adjuvant? Many similar papers claim Mercury in a proprietary preparation, or even the inactivated viruses themselves as the &quot;cause&quot;. But when the paper breathlessly informs that it is &quot;Pearson&#39;s&quot; correlation coefficient my antennae are already twitching.<br><br>They then proceed to inform me of the 95% confidence interval as well as the &quot;significance&quot; at P&lt;0.05 in a two tailed t test. Also a whole bunch of other shit about the meaning of these tests which I immediately recognise as coming straight from a statistical software package. But hold on, weren&#39;t they talking about autism spectrum disorder? I don&#39;t think this qualifies as a continuous distribution and yet they want to perform a parametric test on it!

In the video, you explicitly called out psychology, neuroscience, and medicine, but you then followed this up with a token example from physics in an effort to show that this issue can affect the rigorous sciences as well.  And that&#39;s true, in the sense that there will be the occasional biased or flat-out wrong paper published in the hard sciences.  But the difference is that, in the hard sciences, such flawed findings are typically rooted out very quickly and very publicly.  The simple reason for this is that these fields are cumulative -- i.e., subsequent results build on previous ones -- and so a missing foundation quickly becomes very evident as soon as someone tries to build upon it.  To take your example, the &quot;detection&quot; of the theta+ pentaquark was published in 2003, and by 2006 the field of physics had thoroughly debunked the finding and publicly admitted as much in the Review of Particle Physics that year.  Such rapid and unflinching correction is the hallmark of <b>good</b> science, and it&#39;s tragic that you lump this in with the truly problematic p-hacking that occurs in less rigorous fields.<br><br>Don&#39;t get me wrong -- there is a very real problem occurring in some fields of science, and it&#39;s good for that problem to be brought to light.  But videos (or articles) like this one, which fail to make any real distinction between well-behaved and poorly-behaved fields of science, end up doing all of science a huge disservice.  If the public is broadly skeptical of all scientific results (and who wouldn&#39;t be, after you essentially claimed that ~50% of the literature is wrong?) rather than having their skepticism directed at the appropriate culprits, then it should come as no surprise that distrust of science and scientists is at an all-time high.

Most science that affects our lives, for example medical science or climate science, results from the accumulation of studies that have verified each other.  This process, of course, takes time.  However, when single, unverified studies are used to justify actions, difficulties occur. One example of this is the anti-immunization movement, which was based on the flawed work of one scientist.  Other examples include the attention-grabbing news items about how a certain food is either very good or very bad for human health.  The truth is that many papers that make an unusual claim (that is actually not true) are ignored because there never is another paper that corroborates it.  I also I find the argument that corroborative studies are not published to be misleading.  It can often be a wiser use of research money to do a follow-up study in a way that not simply repeats a published experiment, but that rather plays off of it.  Then, if the follow-up study is successful, more information is gained from the research than would have resulted from a simple repetition of a previous study.

Every piece of research is like inserting a puzzle piece into a puzzle. As we start putting the pieces together, we get an idea of the bigger picture. Although we can infer what the picture may be, we won&#39;t officially know until it is complete. And even when it is complete, perception tells us that it is a mountain and a sunset when in actuality it could be an upside down mountain and sunset or not even those things at all. Philosophy teaches us that we can start to understand things by breaking things down and piecing them together only to find later on that what we perceived as &quot;truth&quot; was only true because of the lack of more information. Scientific method reinforces this. Because all things can be retested to truly determine whether or not it was true. And that my friends is why it is important in the first place to experiment so we can\u00a0elaborate more of the understanding of the universe as well as test our current perceptions of truth.

Other studies prove that their claim of our chromosome number being different over it breaking and rejoining is false. It was a telomere to telomere fusion, which means that a piece of broken DNA, (broken in the middle), and magically reattaching itself is an impossibility.

Also, how did the colored people grow up? If they were subjected to racism all the time there is a possibility that their agression level is higher, leading them to commit more fouls and get more cards. Of course it is also possible that the opposite happens: growing up in a racistic environment might give them so thick skin that they cannot be provoked at all anymore. Has a study on that been made?<br>My point is: To get to the real truth, you need to look into EVERYTHING. That is however way too expensive and complicated, so scientific studies mostly produce results that are good hints to the truth.

In the soccer study, that would mean taking the original study, studies about racism, gender, growing up, the way the different coutries play the game just to name the first that popped into my mind.<br>Then, have several other groups perform the same metastudy and look at the whole thing with a meta-metastudy and then you might start getting towards the truth.<br>Producing half a million pages of studies, metastudies and meta-metastudy would be a tad bit too expensive however. Also, publishing that in a magazine? <b>chuckle</b> &quot;Mom, the postman brought the latest issue of XY-Magazine.

Sharing knowledge is like a forced donation: you have to give some to stand among others, and you have to keep the rest to stand by yourself. It takes years and hundreds of different people to conduct a project from scratch to full optimized verified robust and repeatable experiment: you are never alone and at the &quot;finish line&quot; at the same time.<br><br>It is more than a matter of money. This is a matter of work: if you give what you have when the others don&#39;t, you are a step behind. Also, &quot;if you are good at something, never do it for free&quot;...<br><br>It seems very unappropriate to me to consider that preregistration could solve the problem for example. This is a dreamed version of what reality is: building a research project iteratively along the way, taking new directions, using new diagnostics, changing plans because of hardware problems, material sharing issues, cooperation opportunities, funding insufficiency. One of the first things you learn in research is how much you can&#39;t predict what things are will turn out to be. (example ? You want to observe the voltage on this high-voltage electrode, you will proceed with a high-voltage probe and an oscilloscope. Damn it ! You can&#39;t be precise because of the EMI, and you find out that some guys actually spend years on EMI damping issues.)<br><br>The solution to me: money. True passionate scientists don&#39;t do it for money (do you know how much they get paid ?) they do it for science. If you give them fundings, nice workspaces, good teams, well-designed coherent research programs, I can assure you you will get a hell of a science-making machine. Truth is science is expensive, things are badly organized, fundings are hard to obtain.

Print and open source journals routinely show the unwillingness to publish on the basis of quality of design, importance to the ongoing conversation on a particular topic, adequate power and reasonable analyses as opposed to positive results and that is a real problem in science, hard and soft. The other real problem that I would love to see you guys go after is the proliferation of author print charges that make it difficult to impossible for young researchers/ young profs, and scientists attached to small institutes or colleges to publish. While journals will oh we have a fund for scholars/scientists with no money, I think that&#39;s a dodge not unlike the coupon programs Big Pharma use to get people hooked on super expensive drugs. Publishers claim these charges are reasonable but the price points IMO are exorbitant, and many are at the level that stacks the deck against bright young bulbs with something important to say, but no way to gain access to publication because of the charges.

Unfortunately, science/academia is run like a business. Profit is key. Journals need to make money, institutions need to make money, funding agencies need to convince the rest of the world that the tax dollars spent on scientific research are well spent - and that means results, tangible results. So the scientific effort is reduced to the production of results - as much and as fast as possible. This creates a very destructive pressure on the researcher.<br><br>I&#39;m a graduate student currently working towards an academic career. I have been told by several profs in my field including my advisor that if I want to get a faculty job at a good institution after finishing my phd, I need to have at least 8-9 papers in my CV with at least 2-3 in a high impact journal. The reason is, of course, the sheer amount of competition; there are huge numbers of applicants and very few open positions. When hiring researchers, universities look at their previous research i.e., papers - and people can count much better than they can read. As a grad student, you can dedicate your 4-6 years to one fundamental problem, work on it rigorously, and <del>if things work out</del> end up publishing one or two papers with a huge impact on the field. But when you then go looking for jobs, you&#39;ll have trouble because people can count better than they can read. They&#39;ll say &quot;Oh this guy only has 2 papers but this other guy has 15, let&#39;s hire the other guy.&quot; I know a lot of people in this situation - extremely bright grad students who cannot get faculty positions or even decent postdocs because they don&#39;t have enough papers in their CV. Many grad students who intend to stay in academia are aware of this, and there is no way you can publish at least 8 papers  in 4-6 years without sacrificing rigor and/or reproducibility.<br><br>Sorry for the long comment, but this is something that constantly bothers me and I felt a need to say something.

Big surprise, it is a lot more complicated than these self-serving general public sorts of generalities make it seem.  By way of introduction, I am a physician and have been lead author on two papers podium presented at nationally recognized surgical society meetings, both of which have been selected for publication in peer reviewed surgical journals.  Anyway, after all that, my point is this: most of the time when the popular press reports the results of a paper, the journalist conveniently elects to leave out some very important points.  We do like our new, upcoming physicians to pose questions, collect data and analyze it in the hopes of learning more about how to obtain better outcomes in treating disease.  Many times those efforts don&#39;t really pan out - but they do serve to direct further, more specific studies that may eventually lead to something good and helpful.  On the way, it&#39;s no surprise that some papers aren&#39;t very useful (not generalizable to the public).  So what should you look for in a study?  Look for studies are one of two things: Randomly Controlled Trials and Meta-Analyses.  Now, read the paper, the entire paper.  If there is a word you don&#39;t know, look it up.  Many times the more reputable studies will even tell you in the body of the paper what the weaknesses are, such as: its a prospective study and therefore suffers from bias.  Look for whether or not the study is sponsored by a medical device company or pharmaceutical study and if so, beware!!  So look, don&#39;t complain about the papers - choose carefully which ones to study and review.  Use those to read their references.  Be careful about retrospective studies, studies in limited populations, studies with a small number of participants.
