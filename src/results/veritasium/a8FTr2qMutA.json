Kathiriya\r<br>E-mail \u2013 sagar.kathiriya05@<a href=\"http://gmail.com/\">gmail.com\r</a><br>\r<br>This is theory to understand the quantum state of any particle at any time either it\u2019s observed by an observer or not. By this theory, we can understand \u201cwave-particle duality\u201d of nature. The Position of any quantum particle at any time is the result of deterministic trajectories that emerge from non-hidden Universal field disturbance (non-local, non-global it\u2019s Universal) made by that quantum particle itself. When quantum particle made a disturbance in that filed, ripples are generated from that filed and particle follow that trajectories because any particle with mass can\u2019t move faster than that ripples. That ripples travel at the speed of light. And so, every particle with mass must follow any of those trajectories that created by a ripple of Universal field. And so, what we find as Interference pattern is just a result of that ripples or wave trajectories that have been followed by quantum particle. The Final Position of any particle depends on size &amp; mass of that particle and It also depends on that Fields Intensity. If the field is stronger then we get more Intense Interference Pattern and if that fields Intensity is lower then we will get low Intense Interference pattern from the Double Slit Experiment. \r<br>So, the Only Question is what that non-hidden Universal field is? \r<br>First, it\u2019s everywhere in the Universe. \r<br>Second, it\u2019s not hidden. We already know almost everything about it and It\u2019s first of its kind.\r<br>\r<br> It\u2019s Gravitational Filed.\r<br>To prove this theory we only have to perform the Double Slit Experiment in Deep Space. \r<br>\r<br>And After all, if I\u2019m Correct then I only have to say just two things.\r<br>First, we live in reality and Our Universe is always there, it doesn\u2019t need our Observation. \r<br>Second.

When the photon hits the particle it will transfer some of its energy and momentum to the particle. The energy and momentum will be conserved, due to the fact that the energy and momentum gained by the particle, will equal the energy and momentum that had been lost by the photon( the photons wavelength will be longer because it absorbed lost energy). The reason why we used UV light, is because when UV light hits something, the angle of diffraction happens to be less, than that of let&#39;s say red light due to its short wavelength. This will allow us to pinpoint the precise position of the particle ( decreases the uncertainty in the position of the particle), but due to Compton&#39;s effect, when a particle is hit by high-energy radiation( UV light photon) the uncertainty in the momentum of the particle will increase.<br><br>Now, we could use red light, but it will have the opposite effect. Instead of decreasing the angle of diffraction, it will increase the angle of diffraction, which will decrease the uncertainty in the momentum of the particle, however, it will increase the uncertainty in the location of the particle.<br><br><br>I hope that I was able to help you guys.<br>If I have mentioned something that is wrong, please feel free to correct me,  but be polite.<br><br>Thank you", "comment_date": "2018-06-16T10:29:33Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Dharmesh Patidar", "comment_text": "You are genius but handsome", "comment_date": "2018-06-09T10:16:02Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "5 Dots", "comment_text": "Fascinating.....", "comment_date": "2018-06-06T15:33:49Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "GOD's VOICE", "comment_text": "I dont understand , uncertainty in momentum basically uncertainty in velocity.  if photons are spreading, isnt it the uncertainity in position ?", "comment_date": "2018-06-06T10:06:06Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Ben Roberts", "comment_text": "it&#39;s supposed to be h/2pi not h/4pi", "comment_date": "2018-06-06T04:01:15Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "#STUDY GURU", "comment_text": "<a href=\"https://youtu.be/3hRjft8v93o\">https://youtu.be/3hRjft8v93o</a>", "comment_date": "2018-06-01T16:46:20Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "pushkal kumar Singh", "comment_text": "dude u explained it soo  well ,for me u really deserve a noble prize", "comment_date": "2018-05-31T14:54:52Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Hasan Ayouby", "comment_text": "Did you try doing same experiment using a single photon to see if we get same results?", "comment_date": "2018-05-21T17:03:02Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Anom Chakravorty", "comment_text": "Genius", "comment_date": "2018-05-18T17:23:51Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Dav 4321", "comment_text": "Tanx fo nuttn", "comment_date": "2018-05-17T18:37:56Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Ela Savage van Wizardwitch", "comment_text": "..................................<br><br><br><br><br><br>.<br>.", "comment_date": "2018-05-17T18:27:55Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Chike", "comment_text": "Uncertainty  may be the result of lack of data or understanding, when you have both there can be none.<br>The only reason the light spread is as result of the slit being narrow than the laser beam, never happen before.<br>Make the beam narrower no spread, narrow the slit again it comes again, due to the fact the photons not move in a perfect parallel lines, if they would have there would be no uncertainty, also the thicker is the barrier the uncertainty is smaller.<br>OK you say so we can calculate the angle and know where they  hit, why would they spread?

Now when the slit was made narrower and narrower, the photons which were going to the right and left started bouncing of the sides of the slit and changed their momentum and started moving to the center. This increased the brightness at the center . This is why we see many more bright lines and spots appearing at the center when the slit was narrowing down. When the slit was even more narrowed down ,less number of photons passed through the slit and so the brightness decreased.Also , the photons that are now capable of passing through the slit had more chances of hitting the sides of the slit because the slits were very close enough. So now more photons were hitting the sides and changing their momentum , almost 90% of them. So they were spreading out more and so the brightness at the center decreases more and more. Of course the bouncing to such a degree that the particles bouncing from the left side are interacting with the particles bouncing from the right side and creating crest and troughs pretty far away from the center.\u00a0<br><br>Its particle physics ..not an uncertainty principle. \u00a0Stupid for all the people who can&#39;t think in the right way and believe everything blindly.", "comment_date": "2014-08-09T18:55:13Z", "likes_count": 7}, {"comment_by": "Para Parasolian", "comment_text": "I know HUP, you know HUP, but how do the photos know HUP to behave in the proper way??

They will eventually hit the wall then hit one another and bounce around differently. This is what is happening in your example. \u00a0Now, have another 5 balls thrown exactly the same way right behind the first 5. The first 5 balls now might bounce out of the hall way. \u00a0Much like what you are seeing with your light. \u00a0Not all of them make it, but some will. \u00a0When it is only 5, it is harder to have happen, but when its thousands/millions, the odds go up quite a bit.<br><br>In your example, the particles are fine and are staying in shape until they pass over the narrow choke you presented. Like my ball example.<br>This then causes them to narrow down till they collide and bounce off one another which causes them to go off which ever way. \u00a0Which is basically what you are seeing. Again, exactly like my example.<br>The reason why they pass through is because the other particles behind them that are still coming from the source are pushing them. \u00a0<br><br>Some evidence is that this also explains why the light gets dimmer. That is because not all of the particles are actually making it out. \u00a0Just like the balls down a hall way. \u00a0Not all of them will make it, BUT, some will. \u00a0And the ones that do, will not be going down a straight path. \u00a0Which is why they seem scattered. \u00a0But again, some will.<br><br>(I can see why it is called uncertainty, but still, for the most part, you can be certain that certain things WILL happen.)<br><br>Also, the proof is there, you just can&#39;t see it. \u00a0From the moment the wall obstructs the light, the light is already being scattered. \u00a0Two things are happening. \u00a01, they are bouncing towards to the rest of the light so you can&#39;t really tell, since they overlap, or they are bouncing away but it is to dim or too small of an amount to see. Once the light gets dim entirely, it becomes more apparent. \u00a0Also, the hall becomes MORE narrow which causes the particles to scatter more aggressively. \u00a0Which is why it becomes much more wider.<br><br>I hope I explained it good enough. \u00a0If not, let me know.<br><br>Just a theory BTW. \u00a0I don&#39;t take classes for this stuff.
