He\u2019s an infinite God and as we behold Him we become more like Him in Character. With worshipping the things of this world there can only be degradation. <br><br>\u2022Conversion is not an acknowledgement of Jesus as Savior. It\u2019s when we surrender ourselves to Christ and love Him and others more than self.<br><br>\u2022The winepress Of God\u2019s wrath represents the lies and selfishness that are built up are being destroyed with the unrestrained rivers of truth and love flowing from God.<br><br>\u2022What you sew, you will reap.<br><br>\u2022God treats every single person in this world as his own child.<br><br>\u2022Everyone must be fully persuaded in their own mind. (Romans 14:5)<br><br>\u2022A Christians role is to present truth with love and kindness and then leaving people free. To love God with all their mind, heart, and soul\u2014and loving their neighbor as themselves.<br><br>\u2022True Love is the principle of beneficence\u2014of giving, doing what\u2019s in the best interest of the other person regardless of how one might feel.<br><br>\u2022True Love always heals, always protects, always builds up, never destroys, and never seeks its own; love gives, love is fearless, Love is interested in another. Love is stable, and is orderly and reliable. Love is based on principle and consistent. Love is honest and truthful. Love is patient. Love is kind and it\u2019s forgiving. Love protects and sacrifices self for others.

If so, have you ever stolen anything, lied, looked lustfully, or used God\u2019s name in vain? (Oh God, Jesus Christ, etc.) If you have done this, you have violated God\u2019s moral law, you admit that you are a liar, a thief, a blasphemer, and an adulterer at heart. So, if God gave you justice right away, would you be innocent or guilty? Obviously guilty. Heaven or hell? Obviously hell because you are a criminal in God\u2019s eyes. Don\u2019t ask for forgiveness, try it in court: Judge, I raped a woman and killed her, but I\u2019m so sorry and I won\u2019t do it again. You would still go to jail because you shouldn\u2019t do it again and you should be sorry. So is there any hope? Yes, there is! Out of love and mercy, God became a human being, Jesus Christ. Jesus lived a sinless life and finally died on the cross to bear the punishment we deserve. His resurrection proved that His death was enough to pay our penalty, the penalty for our sins. When someone pays your fine, the judge can leave you, dismiss your case, it\u2019s the same with God. Jesus paid our penalty and in order to accept the free gift of salvation from God, we must believe (have confidence in Jesus for our salvation, His finished work on the Cross). That&#39;s it! God bless you and feel free to ask me any questions about this.

They dug a deep hole in the ground near Homestead FL. They built a metal building over the hole and had a large overhead crane in the building. They built the rocket in the hole and filled it with solid rocket fuel. They installed a &quot;lighter&quot; on top of the upside down rocket. There were huge cables going to two huge concrete foundations. The building was on wheels and was pulled well out of the way before lighting the bottom end of the rocket which was facing upward. They lit the rocket, which blew the lighter upward, with such force, that it broke the cables or shackles. They never found the lighter. \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0The fuel was made in nearby low buildings with special walls between each work station in case of an explosion it would not kill all the people working on the line. There could be no oil allowed to get into the fuel. So the hoists in each station were run without oil or grease. They were 600 or 700 series MMM hoists Muskegan Mich. One of there lead guys came by my shop one day to borrow a jack for the operation. It was a 50 Ton hyd jack. aljenney@<a href=\"http://aol.com/\">aol.com</a>", "comment_date": "2017-09-20T07:04:05Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "E.A.

It&#39;s a well-known principle that in hydraulic systems the force is proportional to the area - so for example, if the brake caliper in your car has a total piston area 5 times the size of the master cylinder/piston attached to the pedal, then the force exerted on the brake pads will be 5 times the force acting on the pedal.<br><br>So why not have a pair of hydraulic cylinders, one being 10,000 times the area of the other? For every 1lb. you put on the small cylinder you&#39;ll get 10,000lb. on the large one. Then you&#39;ll only need 100 lbs of carefully calibrated weight to calibrate the transducer up to 1 million pounds.<br><br>Alternatively, why not use levers? We all know force is proportional to distance from the pivot. So use a very long lever, put the transducer close to the pivot (say 1 foot away), and if you hang weights 10ft away, you&#39;ll be getting 10:1 amplification, so you only need 100,000lbs of weight. Use longer (or more) levers and you can get the same effect for less weight.<br><br>There are probably countless ways to get close to this accuracy using other accurate force-amplification methods.", "comment_date": "2017-05-25T15:30:48Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Martin Barba", "comment_text": "Awesome!!", "comment_date": "2017-05-25T15:29:23Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "First Last", "comment_text": "who could&#39;ve guessed Rick was a scientist ;)", "comment_date": "2017-05-25T15:25:56Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Lucas Werner", "comment_text": "I can bench that", "comment_date": "2017-05-25T15:23:59Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Ghost5.7", "comment_text": "Skinny and fat muffkers still gonna say to buff guys &quot;all that\u00a0 muscle for nothing&quot;", "comment_date": "2017-05-25T15:22:25Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Nicholas Jamieson", "comment_text": "I am surprised the weights are not in a clean room environment considering the accuracy they advertise.
