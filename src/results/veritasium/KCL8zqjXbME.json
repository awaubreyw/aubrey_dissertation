Structured water is Much better for you to drink.\u00a0 The more structured the molecule the\u00a0more energy it can absorb.\u00a0 I don&#39;t know if Veritasium (Derek) just does&#39;t have time to research or he is just stuck in the modern day Dogma like the other scientists. &quot;This is the way it is so just shut up and listen.&quot;", "comment_date": "2014-12-11T16:34:57Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "statikreg", "comment_text": "You forgot to talk about plasma and Bose-Einstein condensates :&#39;(", "comment_date": "2014-12-06T07:33:21Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Mason K98", "comment_text": "The girl with the pony tail, brown coat, and ponytail, depresses me more than my world history class (I live in a rural county in southern america, and yes the education is just as bad as you think it is).", "comment_date": "2014-12-05T23:52:11Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Tjita1", "comment_text": "That dude in the end was actually really neat.", "comment_date": "2014-12-05T21:24:50Z", "likes_count": 295}, {"comment_by": "Spencer Ward", "comment_text": "He forgot plasma", "comment_date": "2014-11-28T21:26:31Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Nick S", "comment_text": "Easy peasy", "comment_date": "2014-11-26T02:38:15Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Method775", "comment_text": "Can anyone explain to me what plasma is then?", "comment_date": "2014-11-19T23:53:32Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "howard baxter", "comment_text": "There are a total of 6 known states.

Under such conditions, a large fraction of the bosons occupy the lowest quantum state, at which point quantum effects become\u00a0<br>\u00a0Boson particles, which include the photon as well as atoms such as helium-4 (4He), are allowed to share quantum states with each other. Einstein demonstrated that cooling boson atoms to a very low temperature would cause them to fall (or &quot;condense&quot;) into the lowest accessible quantum, resulting in a new form of matter.<br><br><br><br><br>Solid<br>Solid is one of the four fundamental states of matter (the others being liquid, gas, and plasma). It is characterized by structural rigidity and resistance to changes of shape or volume. Unlike a liquid, a solid object does not flow to take on the shape of its container, nor does it expand to fill the entire volume available to it like a gas does. The atoms in a solid are tightly bound to each other, either in a regular geometric lattice (crystalline solids, which include metals and ordinary ice) or irregularly (an amorphous solid such as common window glass).<br><br>In other materials, there is no long-range order in the position of the atoms. These solids are known as amorphous; examples include polystyrene and glass.<br>Whether a solid is crystalline or amorphous depends on the material involved, and the conditions in which it was formed. Solids which are formed by slow cooling will tend to be crystalline, while solids which are frozen rapidly are more likely to be amorphous. Likewise, the specific crystal structure adopted by a crystalline solid depends on the material involved and on how it was formed.<br>While many common objects, such as an ice cube or a coin, are chemically identical throughout, many other common materials comprise a number of different substances packed together. For example, a typical rock is an aggregate of several different minerals and mineraloids, with no specific chemical composition. Wood is a natural organic material consisting primarily of cellulose fibers embedded in a matrix of organic lignin. In materials science, composites of more than one constituent material can be designed to have desired properties.<br><br>Liquid<br>Liquid is one of the four fundamental states of matter and is the only state with a definite volume but no fixed shape. A liquid is made up of tiny vibrating particles of matter, such as atoms and molecules, held together by intermolecular bonds. Water is, by far, the most common liquid on Earth. Like a gas, a liquid is able to flow and take the shape of a container. Some liquids resist compression, while others can be compressed. Unlike a gas, a liquid does not disperse to fill every space of a container, and maintains a fairly constant density. A distinctive property of the liquid state is surface tension, leading to wetting phenomena.<br>The density of a liquid is usually close to that of a solid, and much higher than in a gas. Therefore, liquid and solid are both termed condensed matter. On the other hand, as liquids and gases share the ability to flow, they are both called fluids. Although liquid water is abundant on Earth, this state of matter is actually the least common in the known universe, because liquids require a relatively narrow temperature/pressure range to exist. Most known matter in the universe is in gaseous form (with traces of detectable solid matter) as interstellar clouds or in plasma form within stars.<br>Liquid is one of the three primary states of matter, with the others being solid and gas. A liquid is a fluid. Unlike a solid, the molecules in a liquid have a much greater freedom to move. The forces that bind the molecules together in a solid are only temporary in a liquid, allowing a liquid to flow while a solid remains rigid.<br>A liquid, like a gas, displays the properties of a fluid. A liquid can flow, assume the shape of a container, and, if placed in a sealed container, will distribute applied pressure evenly to every surface in the container. Unlike a gas, a liquid may not always mix readily with another liquid, will not always fill every space in the container, forming its own surface, and will not compress significantly, except under extremely high pressures. These properties make a liquid suitable for applications such as hydraulics.<br>Liquid particles are bound firmly but not rigidly. They are able to move around one another freely, resulting in a limited degree of particle mobility. As the temperature increases, the increased vibration of the molecules causes distances between the molecules to increase. When a liquid reaches its boiling point, the cohesive forces that bind the molecules closely together break, and the liquid changes to its gaseous state (unless superheating occurs). If the temperature is decreased, the distances between the molecules become smaller. When the liquid reaches its freezing point the molecules will usually lock into a very specific order, called crystallizing, and the bonds between them become more rigid, changing the liquid into its solid state (unless super cooling occurs).<br>The volume of a quantity of liquid is fixed by its temperature and pressure. Liquids generally expand when heated, and contract when cooled. Water between 0 \u00b0C and 4 \u00b0C is a notable exception. Liquids have little compressibility: water, for example, requires a pressure of the order of 200 bar to increase its density by 1/1000. In the study of fluid dynamics, liquids are often treated as incompressible, especially when studying incompressible flow.<br>Quantities of liquids are commonly measured in units of volume. These include the SI unit cubic metre (m3) and its divisions, in particular the cubic decimetre, more commonly called the litre (1 dm3 = 1 L = 0.001 m3), and the cubic centimetre, also called millilitre (1 cm3 = 1 ml = 0.001 L = 10\u22126 m3).<br><br>Gas<br>Gas is one of the four fundamental states of matter. A pure gas may be made up of individual atoms (e.g. a noble gas or atomic gas like neon), elemental molecules made from one type of atom (e.g. oxygen), or compound molecules made from a variety of atoms (e.g. carbon dioxide). A gas mixture would contain a variety of pure gases much like the air. What distinguishes a gas from liquids and solids is the vast separation of the individual gas particles. This separation usually makes a colorless gas invisible to the human observer. The interaction of gas particles in the presence of electric and gravitational fields are considered negligible as indicated by the constant velocity vectors in the image.<br>The gaseous state of matter is found between the liquid and plasma states,[1] the latter of which provides the upper temperature boundary for gases. Bounding the lower end of the temperature scale lie degenerative quantum gases which are gaining increasing attention. High-density atomic gases super cooled to incredibly low temperatures are classified by their statistical behavior as either a Bose gas or a Fermi gas.<br>Gas phase particles (atoms, molecules, or ions) move around freely in the absence of an applied electric field. Drifting smoke particles provide clues to the movement of the surrounding gas.<br>The speed of a gas particle is proportional to its absolute temperature. The volume of the balloon in the video shrinks when the trapped gas particles slow down with the addition of extremely cold nitrogen. The temperature of any physical system is related to the motions of the particles (molecules and atoms) which make up the [gas] system. In statistical mechanics, temperature is the measure of the average kinetic energy stored in a particle. The methods of storing this energy are dictated by the degrees of freedom of the particle itself (energy modes). Kinetic energy added (endothermic process) to gas particles by way of collisions produces linear, rotational, and vibrational motion. In contrast, a molecule in a solid can only increase its vibrational modes with the addition of heat as the lattice crystal structure prevents both linear and rotational motions. These heated gas molecules have a greater speed range which constantly varies due to constant collisions with other particles. The speed range can be described by the Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution. Use of this distribution implies ideal gases near thermodynamic equilibrium for the system of particles being considered.<br>In physics, particularly statistical mechanics, the Maxwell\u2013Boltzmann distribution or Maxwell distribution describes particle speeds in gases, where the particles move freely without interacting with one another, except for very brief elastic collisions in which they may exchange momentum and kinetic energy, but do not change their respective states of intermolecular excitation, as a function of the temperature of the system, the mass of the particle, and speed of the particle. Particle in this context refers to the gaseous atoms or molecules \u2013 no difference is made between the two in its development and result.<br>1000 atoms a gas occupy the same space as any other 1000 atoms for any given temperature and pressure. This concept is easier to visualize for solids such as iron which are incompressible compared to gases. Since a gas fills any container in which it is placed, volume is an extensive property.<br><br><br>Plasma<br>Plasma is one of the four fundamental states of matter. It comprises the major component of the Sun. Heating a gas may ionize its molecules or atoms, thus turning it into plasma, which contains charged particles: positive ions and negative electrons or ions. \u00a0Plasma can also be created by the application of an electric field on a gas. Plasma, therefore, has properties quite unlike those of solids, liquids, or gases and is considered a distinct state of matter. Like gas, plasma does not have a definite shape or a definite volume unless enclosed in a container; unlike gas, under the influence of a magnetic field, it may form structures such as filaments, beams and double layers. Some common plasmas are found in stars and neon signs. A plasma is sometimes referred to as being &quot;hot&quot; if it is nearly fully ionized, or &quot;cold&quot; if only a small fraction (for example 1%) of the gas molecules are ionized but other definitions of the terms &quot;hot plasma&quot; and &quot;cold plasma&quot; are common. Even in a &quot;cold&quot; plasma, the electron temperature is still typically several thousand degrees Celsius. Plasma is not made of atoms.<br>Typical ranges of plasma parameters: orders of magnitude (OOM)<br>Characteristic \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Terrestrial plasmas \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Cosmic plasmas<br>Size<br>in meters \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a010\u22126 m (lab plasmas) to<br>102 m (lightning) (~8 OOM)<br>10\u22126 m (spacecraft sheath) to<br>1025 m (intergalactic nebula) (~31 OOM)<br>Lifetime<br>in seconds \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a010\u221212 s (laser-produced plasma) to<br>107 s (fluorescent lights) (~19 OOM) \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0101 s (solar flares) to<br>1017 s (intergalactic plasma) (~16 OOM)<br>Density<br>in particles per<br>cubic meter \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0107 m\u22123 to<br>1032 m\u22123 (inertial confinement plasma) \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a01 m\u22123 (intergalactic medium) to<br>1030 m\u22123 (stellar core)<br>Temperature<br>in degrees Kelvin \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0~0 K (crystalline non-neutral plasma) to<br>108 K (magnetic fusion plasma) \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0102 K (aurora) to<br>107 K (solar core)<br>Magnetic fields<br>in teslas \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a010\u22124 T (lab plasma) to<br>103 T (pulsed-power plasma) \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a010\u221212 T (intergalactic medium) to<br>1011 T (near neutron stars)", "comment_date": "2014-03-08T09:48:26Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Sujit Suram", "comment_text": "god ppl are dumb!", "comment_date": "2014-03-08T08:13:06Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Mimzee", "comment_text": "Plasma and bode-einstien are also states of matter.", "comment_date": "2014-03-02T15:55:29Z", "likes_count": 49}, {"comment_by": "Nemesis101", "comment_text": "i want to say more about this subject but my english vocabulary isn&#39;t good enough", "comment_date": "2014-03-02T12:26:45Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Nemesis101", "comment_text": "keep in mind that ice has a lower density than water that&#39;s why ice floats on water. this is because there are hydrogen bridges. i don&#39;t know if I&#39;m saying it right because I&#39;m translating this because Im dutch", "comment_date": "2014-03-02T12:16:53Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Sanya76", "comment_text": "Oh my god ppl are so dumb these days!", "comment_date": "2014-03-02T11:11:11Z", "likes_count": 2}, {"comment_by": "PetitCorpsSalade", "comment_text": "Hahahaha the dude at the end is awesome", "comment_date": "2014-03-01T18:05:19Z", "likes_count": 20}, {"comment_by": "Scott Taylor", "comment_text": "You forgot that water is hydrogen monoxide and that B.E.C.
