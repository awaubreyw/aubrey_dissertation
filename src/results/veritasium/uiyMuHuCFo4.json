While it is true that there are spring forces counteracting gravity at each point of the slinky when Derek holds it, this does not fully explain why the lower part completely floats as the upper part collapses. The \u201cinformation\u201d propagation is the important factor to consider. I would like to elaborate on that a bit.<br><br>First, let\u2019s see why the spring-force explanation alone does not explain the phenomenon. You understand it correctly that the tension completely negates the gravity leading to the stable equilibrium when Derek holds the slinky at the top. But it does not explain the dynamics after he releases it. In particular, it is not clear why the bottom still experiences the same gravity-negating spring tension while the top collapses. Shouldn\u2019t the spring force gradually decrease as the slinky contracts back leading to the net force pointing downwards?<br><br>In order to understand it, watch the video again and try to see which parts of the slinky do not move when Derek releases it. You will notice that not only the bottom floats but some segments above it too. You might also see the traveling longitudinal wave that sort of \u201cactivates\u201d different parts of the slinky from top to bottom. This wave is what was referred to as \u201cinformation\u201d in the video. If you have studied solid states physics, you may realize that this is a phonon.<br><br>Now, what about the rotation at the bottom? The slinky is stretched not just longitudinally but also torsionally (in a transverse direction). It appears that this second wave travels faster than the first one. As the result, the information about torsional stretching reaches the lower parts of the slinky sooner that the info about longitudinal stretching.<br><br>The wave\u2019s speed depends on several factors but rigidity is one of them. If you repeat the same experiment with a usual spring rather than a slinky, the floating time will decrease significantly.

Space devoid of all matter is still full of aether aka quantum fluid or quantum energy which means there never will be such thing as empty space. Also center of mass doesn&#39;t equal to center of gravity. Gravity doesn&#39;t have a center, it is non-point source omnidirectional static acceleration of aether towards the surface of a charged body like planet.

I used to think it was a piece of light material being blown around by the wind or something deflecting off of the club, but it kept happening and sometimes it seemed to defy the laws of physics, so I kept searching for an explanation. I think it is because, as objects, especially metal objects with strong reflective properties that can also expand, contract, bend etc. as they store and release some kind of kinetic energy (golf club and slinky are perfect examples).. their centers of gravity shift and wobble and rotate constantly with respect to the camera lens, and the white spot is essentially the representation of the objects center of gravity returning to a fixed position as it approaches its resting state. This could be something else but it is the EXACT kind of thing I have spent many hours learning and coming to understand to the point that I am able to capture the phenomenon at will, and even control it&#39;s starting point and the movement across the screen that it exhibits. For example when I swing a golf club, the club is moving on an arch, and I swing the club back and up with pressure exclusively in my right hand, so the club is anchored and hinged with my conscious feeling being that it is several inches shorter than when I apply pressure and hinge the club at impact with my left hand. When I do this, for those of you who have some piano playing experience, I do so the same way you play notes &quot;legato&quot; on the piano... meaning I release the right hand and grip with the left with one conscious command, as though the action is not two seperate but one simultaneous. It feels very much like the club is getting shorter on the way back, and immediately becoming longer when the hinge/anchor point changes. This happens in an insanely short amount of time and in conjunction with the club impacting the back of the ball as well as the ground, releasing the clubs stored energy... it is also precisely when the white dot appears and moves &quot;impossibly&quot; across the screen. It is easiest to anticipate in terms of where to put the camera and where to position myself relative to it, and most apparent on the recorded video when the sun is between 30 and 45 degrees, do mid morning or mid to late afternoon, when the sun is still very bright but the shadows are elongated noticeably more so than the actual length of the club. My hypothesis is - the center of gravity is rotating and moving up and down during the swing, and the club is bending and twisting with enough force and it is changing from a horizontal plane to a vertical impact plane, so the stored energy is actually being released through impact at exactly the same time as the club is being tilted and rotated in to the upright position. I believe this causes it to create an overlapping event in which the clubs center of gravity is undefined, for a tin tiny tiny fraction of a second. You can clearly see that there are, in some cases, as many as 12 extremely bright halos of white light that simultaneously flash on the shaft at the moment the energy is released, and in the very next frame, the image and position of everything, including the ball and club and me and EVERYTHING else is in the exact same position (which is weird, given what happens next) and the only change is that the shaft of the club is no longer metallic with bright dots up and down it, instead it is a dim, slightly shorter, transparent shadow. This is with a high definition, 1000 frame per second, slow motion setting. In the following frame the club is not visible because it appears to have somehow, in the course of 1/1000th of a second, managed to cover about 3 feet worth of arch, and in the opposite direction of the path it took through impact. After that, aside from an insanely amazing feeling, it basically behaves normally to the average observer. I can tell that it is doing something subtle and interesting because I know what it feels like as it shoot s up in to the followthrough, but no one else can gain anything from it. The notable thing is that, during the frames when the club goes from bright spotty light halos to compressed transparent shadowy thingy... the bright spot pops up and traces a seemingly impossible path across the screen, jumping and bouncing around like it is a UFO from a bad fake home video in the 70s. Sometimes, if I do it without actually hitting a ball, I can clip the ground just right and get the spot to trace a smooth slightly curved path before disappearing, like it does in the first slinky drop in this video. I am working on a video right now showing exactly what I mean, and explaining how I go about capturing it personally. I will also explain exactly what the logic of my hypothesis was/is, and how I went about discounting every other seemingly more likely reason for the repeated appearance of the spot. The idea being, any one who has survived reading this up to this point, and is actually interested in seeing what I mean.... can determine with confidence that I am not crazy... or that I am. Either way it will allow such a person to make an educated decision on the matter. I&#39;m pretty confident.... actually scratch that I am absolutely positive that the inquiring mind of any viewer who takes the time and pays attention to what is happening will be more than intrigued.. and will probably be driven to the driving range just like they were driven to Wal Mart for a slinky upon seeing this video.<br>Thanks for reading and I apologize if this sounds like an attempt to push traffic my way.

The Slinky&#39;s contraction starts and is maintained from the top which is freed and collapsing under tension also against the center of mass (below it) while also falling with the force of gravity, accelerating at a rate near 2 G&#39;s.  The resulting standing wave cannot propagate faster than the falling center of mass while the length of the released Slinky contracts when its bottom is maintained in equilibrium between gravity &amp; contraction.  A much stiffer and/or shorter spring wouldn&#39;t likely behave this way because the natural frequency of the spring would be too high for the C.G. to catch it in its descent.  Rotation of the bottom coils results from the way all contracting extension springs are made in which a twist of the wire (around the <b>wire&#39;s</b> axis) is accompanied by helically coiling the spring so that it maintains a fully compressed form until extending forces are applied; the wire-twist stores and releases spring energy, twirling the coil around its helical axis in a screw-like manner and increasing the coil diameter slightly as it contracts in length.", "comment_date": "2017-01-10T06:41:49Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Dave", "comment_text": "The time it takes for the compression wave to get from the top to the bottom should be the time it takes for the Centre of Gravity of the spring to fall to the bottom. <br><br>This distance will be close, but a bit less than half of the extended Slinky&#39;s length since the tension between the rings in the top is larger and so the extension is larger.
