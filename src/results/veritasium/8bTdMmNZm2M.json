You are just seeing one side of the picture.<br>The gravitational attraction of the earth on the moon is the force of  action of the earth on the moon owing to the Earth&#39;s mass, and the reaction of that force by the moon independent of it&#39;s(the moon&#39;s) own mass is equal in magnitude but opposite in direction to that of the force it experiences. But the action of the gravitational pull of the moon on the earth owing to it&#39;s(the moons) own mass which is a lot less will also be less, but the force of reaction by the earth will also be equal in magnitude but opposite in direction on the moon also  independent of it&#39;s own mass. Otherwise they should both spiral and collide into each other. How do you explain them orbiting each other ? What is weird though is have you thought, given the ratio of the masses of the earth to the moon would the moon still continue to orbit the earth, if it&#39;s orbital distance was in cosmological terms even slightly different. Could this precise orbital distance for this precise pair of masses have resulted by chance and by accident ?

Yes, the forces on Earth and the moon are equal (and opposite): F = GMm/r^2, where M is Earth&#39;s mass and m is the moon&#39;s mass. But Earth&#39;s gravitational field acting on the moon is GM/r^2, whereas the moon&#39;s field acting on Earth is only Gm/r^2. The other reason is that the acceleration of the moon is F/m, while that of Earth is only F/M.
