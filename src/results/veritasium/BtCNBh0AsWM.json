When people want to learn about someone else&#39;s culture, what do they want to learn. They want to know how they live their lives. What food they eat? How kind or cold are strangers? What clothes do you wear? What ideas are prevalent in your society and why? Culture is a term to generalize the daily lives, practices, and beliefs of a group of people.

You make it sound like the Norse were on the verge of dying out until they discovered glorious cod. In reality Norway has been populated for 10,000 years since the end of the last ice age. Not all of the populations that have lived there in that time have made cod a staple of their diet, especially inland populations.<br><br><br>I&#39;m also not aware of any studies claiming that the Greenland Norse disappeared due to vitamin D deficiency. In fact bone analysis shows that they changed from a predominantly terrestrial diet at the beginning of the settlement (ca 1000) to a predominantly marine-based diet towards the end (15th century). The Norse hunted a lot of seal, which like cod is rich in vitamin D and omega-3 fatty acids, and they made seal oil, which has similar health benefits to cod liver oil. The best explanation put forward so far is that local climate conditions as a result of the Little Ice Age did them in. The Norse diet, by the end of the settlement, was similar to the Inuits who came to Greenland around the same time and are still there to this day.

That is to say it was an activity - the looting, the pillaging, the storming of monasteries, that was &quot;Viking&quot;. It became a term attached to the peoples of the Scandinavian peninsula who partook in this activity, although contemporary sources such as the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle don&#39;t refer to them as such. You can describe them as Norse if you want to generalise, which refers to their shared religious and cultural practices, or you can refer to them by their individual denomyns, which just happen to correspond perfectly to the modern Nordic countries - Danes, Swedes, Norwegians (or just Norse, which is why it can be incorrect to use Norse to refer to all Scandinavians), and Icelanders/Greenlanders. Scandinavian is also wrong not only because the Norse expanded their cultural reach beyond Scandinavia to places such as England, Ireland (where they founded Dublin), to Ukraine (they founded Kyiv), and yes, to North America, but also because the Sami people of Finland and the Lapps and various other peoples live/d in Scandinavia, and they are NOT Norse because they don&#39;t speak a Nordic language, which is a Germanic language family, and because they are a culturally and ethnically distinct peoples.<br><br>Second, your point about scurvy. Yes, it greatly contributed to the prosperity of the British colonial empire, but they came to dominate the seas in the late 18th/early 19th century, which is pretty late in the grand scheme of things. They were not the first nation to establish a colonial empire off of the back of naval dominance, they were merely following in the tradition of their contemporaries, which were the French and the Dutch. And of course the first great colonial empires were established by Spain and Portugal, and the Spanish Empire controlled most of the continental Americas and monopolised Trans-Atlantic trade hundreds of years before the days when one could say that the sun never set on the British Empire. It would therefore be naive to assume that they didn&#39;t benefit from the knowledge of the world and of maritime practices that were learnt and developed by the Portuguese, the Spanish, and the Dutch.<br><br>And last point, most of the early English colonial endeavours were massive failures. Their colony in Roanoke, the first in the modern United States, vanished without a trace; the Jamestown colony never turned a profit for its shareholders which is what it was designed to do; and they lagged well behind France and Spain when it came to capitalising on the insanely lucrative sugar trade in the Caribbean (which the Portuguese didn&#39;t need to muscle in on because they had their own profitable sugar colonies in Brazil).", "comment_date": "2019-07-07T21:45:49Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "amir mirou", "comment_text": "Bacalhau !
