Let me explain how!<br>There is a pressure called curviture pressure, caused by the liquid&#39;s intention to have as small surface area as possible. It is because on the top layer of liquids, there are a set of molecules, and they are pulled by the other ones by cohesic force. In this case, the golfball doesn&#39;t attract the molecules that much, so the sum of these forces point downwards (prependicularly to the surface), but they cant move since there is no place for them, so they are on a higher energy state (such as potential energy). The larger the area is, the more &quot;border molecules&quot; the liquid has, so does it have higher energy.<br>Curviture pressure is caused by this intention and it points towards the &quot;center&quot; of the liquid surface. As soapy water has a smaller surface tension than usual water, the sum of curviture pressure points upwards, and it causes the ball to lift, until the surface of the soapy water has a smaller area and the curviture pressures even out with the other forces.<br>It is a small effecdt tho, but is worth to mention. :)", "comment_date": "2015-03-23T19:26:19Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Todney W", "comment_text": "Your increasing the head pressure on the salt water, also the golf ball but since the golf ball is a sealed unit the internal pressure of the golf ball doesn&#39;t change.

Now if u put detergent on top of the piston, is the new net force on the piston going to be downwards or upwards (buoyancy)?\u00a0<br>The reason I&#39;m asking this is because I thought that the force vectors due to the pressure on an object in a fluid are all orthogonal to its surface. Therefore, in your experiment if you imagine all the force vectors created by the pressure the detergent exerts on the exposed part of the ball, its hard to see any vectors whose y component would be facing upwards.

In the Detergent, the rate of decent indicates that there is a small downward acceleration so the force of gravity is only slightly smaller than the bouyant force of the Detergent (hoping that viscous resistance isnt a big factor). In the salt water, the point at which the volume of the golfball submerged is floating- is the point at which the force of gravity (Fgrav = Mg) equals the water displaced by the lower 1/16 or so of the ball. we can say that because of the way the ball operates. The density of the Detergent is less than the density of the Salt water. Thus pouring Detergent in will (void of active stirring... fingers crossed it stays stratified) float as a layer on top of the salt water and below the air. Now, when we look at the golfball, it experiences the same single downward force from the weight of the golfball. A unit of bouyant force from the saltwater directed upwards. And a slight, but not negligable upward force from the Detergent. This Causes the ratio of the Vsaltwater to Vdetergent to increase and reballance.
