This appears as a continuous ripple effect. So then, to record motion  or condition at one location should translate to the affected motion of any single particle at any other location or distance. Further, it would affect all of a remote particle&#39;s neighbouring particles. In theory, action at a remote location could be decoded from the action of local particles relative to each other? Could vice-versa be true, so that altering the movement of local particles directs the progress and direction of events at a remote location? Oh, wait, this is entanglement or spooky action at a distance. Thing is, sub-atomic particles move at or beyond the speed of light so that time does not exist for them.

You don&#39;t actually share 99.9% of your DNA with all other life forms, but you do with ANY other life form. Compare any two people, and their DNA is almost identical, but the differences that distinguish James from Brandon are NOT the same differences that distinguish James from Mary, even though those two are also nearly identical. This is how genetic diseases happen. Most people have A where a small group of people has B, but all those A and B people might have C where another small group has D. (B causes one genetic disease and D causes another.) There isn&#39;t just a &quot;grab bag&quot; section of the DNA code in which all these diseases appear; they&#39;re spread out randomly among the &quot;normal&quot; lines of code. If you compare one organism with another, then they&#39;re 99.9% the same. But if you then compare a third organism to those two, the DNA shared by all three drops well below 99.9%. Add a fourth, and the DNA shared by all becomes an even smaller percentage of the total. If you keep adding organisms, the total amount shared is almost nothing.<br><br>Edit: I thought of a better way to explain this. Imagine a sequence of a hundred letters where 99 of them are x and one of them is y. You could have, for instance, a y followed by 99 x&#39;s, or 99 x&#39;s followed by a y, or xy followed by 98 x&#39;s, etc. If you compare any two of them and ask the question, &quot;How many x&#39;s are in the same place?&quot; the answer is always &quot;98.&quot; (If you compare the first two, then the middle 98 x&#39;s are the same.) But add a third sequence for comparison, and only 97 x&#39;s are in the same place for all three. If you add all one hundred possible sequences together and ask the same question, then NONE of them have even a single x that is in the same place as all the others, even though it&#39;s still true that any two sequences accord with 98 of their hundred x&#39;s.

We encode information in bits but bits have no inherent meaning. For us to extract the information we actually need to know a bit more: the algorithm with which we can decode the information again. After all: 1010 is just 4 bits. You don&#39;t know what it is. Is it a 4bit number, is it two 2bit numbers, is it part of an image? We don&#39;t know. That&#39;s not encoded within the bits. With shanon we can calculate how many bits we need to encode a symbol. However, it&#39;s up to us to define what exactly a symbol is. If you treat combinations of letters as symbols then you will be able to compress even further. In an image uniform (colour) areas have less entropy but saying it doesn&#39;t contain much information depends on &quot;information to whom&quot;. After all, all these pixels carry the same amount of information in the sense that you know that there&#39;s a uniform area in that image. In image compression regions of pixels of almost the same color are compressed as regions of exactly the same color because the human eye doesn&#39;t notice it so we could say that these pixels contain less information to us. But do they? You can even compress huge random sequences if you can find a seed and a PRNG that generates this sequence meaning that the sequence wouldn&#39;t contain as much information as once thought. I find it hard to come up with an exact definition for &quot;information&quot;. 0000 contains as much information as 0101 even though the first one can be compressed better but the amount of information in it is the same.

&quot;Spooky coincidences&quot;. I left a comment on his video, but I think the idea gives a new insight into your conception of information. I&#39;m not going to enter the debate about the possibility of &quot;predicting&quot; and &quot;recalling&quot; information based on the actual state of matter and energy around us, but I do think there&#39;s something you didn&#39;t mention and I believe it&#39;s important.<br><br>I&#39;m talking about the order of a sequence or data string. First, you mentioned ASCII code as a way to computationally express human language, and while it&#39;s true there&#39;s a certain load of information associated to each letter (that is, one byte), the output also depends on the order of these elements. It becomes obvious that the order of the elements in a string is key to the total information load if you take anagrams into account: for example, &quot;mutilate&quot; and &quot;ultimate&quot; have exactly the same letters and even some of them are similarly ordered, but the change in the position of some of them yields two entirely different words.<br><br>Later, you mentioned DNA sequences as a 2-bit resolution sequence, but anyone who has taken biology on high school knows that the key feature of DNA sequences are the transcription and translation of large sequences into similarly ordered sequences which, at a later stage of synthesis, become entangled in a network of weak interactions that depend on the sequence of the peptide, and not just the elements conforming it. Blah, blah, blah, gibberish. What I mean to say is that you implied that the elements conforming language (either letters, as seen in ASCII or DNA sequences; or syllables, of which I&#39;m not going to talk, but also were mentioned to have a certain load of information) contain information, but organization of these elements contains just as much information. Why is it not reflected on, let&#39;s say, larger memory requirements for computers processing text? Because the order of the binary digits reflects the order of the characters, therefore making it unnecessary to input more data. And yet, there&#39;s a certain load of information contained in the order of each data string.<br><br>Sorry for the long post, anyway.

The truth is that I haven&#39;t seen this calculation being done.<br>First of all, since we do not know the initial state, we cannot use the Lagrangian formulation - so we will have to stick with the Hamiltonian.<br><br>Now there are two problems; first, is the measurement problem - not treated by theory - and secondly can we really calculate the earlier state?<br><br>For the measurement problem we can postulate the following; suppose that we somehow obtain information about the wavefunction of a big chunk of the world and that we can from that calculate the wavefunction at an earlier time. But what would happen if there has been measurements (whose outcomes we do not know) between the time we do know and the time we want to arrive at? We will need a theory that could deal with measurement. And in a dense world, such as the one we live in, measurements are performed frequently, so objects appear to have definite paths. There is an analogy between this situation and particles in cloud chambers where particles appear to have definite paths. However, can we always predict their backwards motion indefinitely? That&#39;s an open question.<br><br>Secondly, we can note that as a 2nd order pde, the time-dependent Schroedinger equation is similar to the equation describing heat dissipation and diffusion processes (only with complex coefficients) - and it is known that we cannot reconstruct an earlier state from a later state for these systems; this is because many different initial conditions will evolve towards the same final state; and so they eventually become indistinguishable. This also has parallels with entropy (that is in the case of heat dissipation and diffusion processes).<br><br>So it is not clear that we can reconstruct an earlier state from the current one, even in principle.

If it is possible for you to spare any free moments explaining this to me it would be very valuable. Here are a few questions i came up with. How do qbit size&#39;s very from bits, since its a probablity, shouldnt it be exponentially larger? How does this compare with the human body and what we can store in our brains? Will there be a time using the latest physics where we will be able to store and process information using qbit technology.\u00a0<br><br>Thanks for your time,\u00a0<br>Arc", "comment_date": "2014-07-03T18:15:45Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Strange Charm", "comment_text": "Two words: Uncertanty principle<br>Through the increasing entropy and the uncertanty information becomes unretrievable on medium timescales.", "comment_date": "2014-07-03T18:14:24Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Video Trash", "comment_text": "cool video. but i think you&#39;re overestimating the purpose behind counting bits... knowing how many bits it would take to represent the sequence of bases in your genome dosent tell you much- because you can DO NOTHING with this &quot;information&quot; alone. you also have to know about the insanely complex machinery that is actually transforming the dna into proteins etc. same goes for your mindblowing example at the end of the video: reconstructing the vibrations in the air wouldn&#39;t give you any information about the semantics- you&#39;d have to have figured out the entire brain to get something out of that. so i think this is a rather naive approach to information your introducing here, but interesting nonetheless!", "comment_date": "2014-07-03T18:13:57Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Rangiani", "comment_text": "Laplace&#39;s demon and determinism...
