Idk what it was that clicked in my brain this year, I really can\u2019t say for sure how much this video had to do with it but I will say that the strategy I used was pretty much exactly what you laid out here. Small incremental changes week after week that slowly add up over time. It\u2019s crazy how much better my life is now compared to how it was when this video came out. I have my own place, an investment portfolio and I\u2019m finally on track to actually get sober by slowly eliminating all the drugs and unhealthy food I\u2019ve been addicted to for decades. I\u2019m like a completely different person. This time last year I was 185 lbs, ate fast food multiple times a week and took as much as 15 grams of phenibut a day along with the suboxone I used to get off heroin. As I type this I\u2019m completely off suboxone and down to 2 grams a day of phenibut. I don\u2019t eat fast food at all and just prior to watching this I ran an 11 minute mile. And if that doesn\u2019t sound impressive just know that I haven\u2019t tried to run in literally years and keeping a steady pace of 5.5mph for an entire mile is a huge accomplishment for me especially as it followed a workout that included 100 pull ups, 200 push ups and 300 squats. <br><br>Anyway sorry I\u2019m totally rambling here it\u2019s just that this video reminded me of how far I\u2019ve come since you uploaded it and I\u2019m really stoked on all my progress.

For example, the fitness industry has convinced people that they need to exercise to lose weight. As a lifelong fitness nut I can tell you that this is completely untrue. Numerous studies have shown that exercise is almost completely ineffectual for losing weight. So of course people quit after a couple of months. Why would anyone continue to do something that&#39;s uncomfortable, inconvenient, and doesn&#39;t work? This isn&#39;t laziness. It&#39;s logic. When setting any goal, it&#39;s important to check your assumptions at the door and do some research. Sometimes that means some real digging. People who go to the gym daily tend to have a healthy body weight, but it doesn&#39;t follow from this that going to the gym is the reason they are thin. With a little thought it&#39;s obvious that diet is also a factor, and some research from that point will show that when it comes to weight loss, diet is by far the most influential factor. This doesn&#39;t mean you shouldn&#39;t exercise, though, just that exercising for weight loss is doomed to fail.", "comment_date": "2020-04-20T18:52:50Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Somen N.S", "comment_text": "Thank u very much.Good work , love it....", "comment_date": "2020-04-19T13:22:10Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Speed of Light", "comment_text": "i will be number one", "comment_date": "2020-04-16T15:20:47Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "anonther usere", "comment_text": "This is the dumbest video I&#39;ve seen on the entire youtube site.

If you feel safe because you have improved your environment so as to get rid your typical distractions - e.g. you can no longer browse socials or read the news - chances are you will lower your guard and those distractions will come back in another form, or new distractions will sneak up on you. A rather silly example: you feel you&#39;re saving time by staying away from socials and newspapers, hence you think you can treat yourself to a couple minesweeper games, and before you know it, you end up wasting as much time as you used to. The solution to this in my opinion: improving your environment by ALSO allowing yourself some small, carefully planned treats - such as 1-2 minesweeper games MAX as a reward for the hard work - such that your mind doesn&#39;t really miss the distractions.", "comment_date": "2020-01-17T14:31:58Z", "likes_count": 2}, {"comment_by": "Gamerboybleu HD", "comment_text": "I want to invent/build a new armor for soldiers to go to wars and not... well, die and to have a better hand to hand combat advantage", "comment_date": "2020-01-17T14:12:56Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "PSPKriz", "comment_text": "My new years resolution is 3840 by 2160 10bit 120 Hz HDR.", "comment_date": "2020-01-17T12:16:46Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Shubham Talks", "comment_text": "1% rule or 2 min rule<br>Be specific<br>Write down goals<br>Daily planner<br>Track progress in visual way<br>Don&#39;t trust your willpower<br>Remove distractions", "comment_date": "2020-01-17T06:25:37Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Shubham Talks", "comment_text": "Atomic Habits", "comment_date": "2020-01-17T06:19:38Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Liam 500", "comment_text": "Dio", "comment_date": "2020-01-16T14:17:49Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Daniel Chan", "comment_text": "Tracking my daily exercise in a spreadsheet", "comment_date": "2020-01-16T05:24:14Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Ben Schuster", "comment_text": "I thought this video was about video resolutions", "comment_date": "2020-01-15T16:32:43Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Yoosuf Albaaqir", "comment_text": "I am gonna score more than 90% in my annuals this year", "comment_date": "2020-01-15T12:53:05Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "NiCeDarox", "comment_text": "I commit myself to meet my creature or at least another person like me and find out wtf.", "comment_date": "2020-01-15T12:36:42Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "JoleFin", "comment_text": "320x200 was not a fail, and 1080p has also been a huge success.", "comment_date": "2020-01-15T00:15:12Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Eben Tee Entertainment", "comment_text": "ooops, wooow", "comment_date": "2020-01-14T23:18:22Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Roach Dogg JR", "comment_text": "OK...<br>I&#39;m going to stop going to 7-11 so often.

You made a video about self-driving cars and most car manufacturers plan to sell them to public this year. But in the documentary Unit 8200 by Martin Himel, he has shown that intelligent cars (not even self-driving) that can connect to the internet or connect to smartphone can be hacked and be losing control of steering wheel and brake pedal, among many other things. The company Argus, composed of mostly former Israeli army hackers, makes antivirus for cars while fully knowing that car hacking can be used for assassination, terrorism, and war. The fact that they could always hack into cars is quite troubling since that means other hackers can also do it and with the proliferation of self-driving cars, which are basically robots with AI, it can become even more dangerous than nuclear weapons. Self-driving and intelligent cars are mass produced and everywhere, and they don&#39;t cause nuclear fallout. So if some country or rogue group with access to potent virus and computing power, they can command an army of robots that can end humanity as we know it.", "comment_date": "2020-01-12T19:12:25Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "I Am Groot", "comment_text": "learn to touch type, so far so good.", "comment_date": "2020-01-12T16:55:25Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "TheMetalalien", "comment_text": "my resolution is one i try for 3 years now to stop wasting energy with worring about things and invest that energy into working on the things that worry me instead , but not sure how to cut this down to specific measurable progress tho... oh well", "comment_date": "2020-01-12T11:00:39Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "John Grey", "comment_text": "Completely off topic, and likely a stupid question, but I want to know: if a balloon was rigid and strong enough to withstand the force, wouldn&#39;t a balloon filled with vacuum be lighter than one filled with helium?

I do however hope that I have learned my lesson though, and that I can get into a new (temporary) habit of biting into gum whenever i feel tempted instead.<br><br>My other resolution i imagine is actually a bit harder, cut back on sodas, sugars and meat and eat more vegetarian. The first part is the hard part, but it ties into the second part because eating healthy actually makes us picky eaters strangely enough. If we eat healthier, then our body rewards us by telling us that this is good for us just like it tells us that junk-food and all the other stuff tastes great if we have been eating that for a prolonged period. I do however have a small love for vegetarian already so it is more about taking the time to prepare it, learning to get into habits of cooking it and above all else, making something that i find palatable (i somehow have never managed that with vegetarian meals so far). I have gotten a few books that combines foods in ways that are supposed to be a tasty treat but at the same time, healthy.<br><br>As far as exercise goes, not a plan for this years resolutions, hopefully a better living overall will give me an energy boosts so that i will get of my bony ass (cause i am a very thin guy overall) and get into better shape.<br><br>But for those thinking this is too much and too big goals, not to worry, I have a plan.

Though candy isn&#39;t really a problem for me, I&#39;ll start to buy more vegetables and store them on the counter rather than in my fridge, like Derek advised. I think vegetables are great, so this will give me a way to eat more of them. I&#39;ll also be starting a food diary, which is something I used to do.<br>3. Study well for my matriculation exams.

Changing the entire economy for northern Alberta isn&#39;t really an option, so I plan on fulfilling a lot of small goals to help both me and my community get a safer and more accessible fresh water supply.", "comment_date": "2019-12-29T20:17:39Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "LALM thelegendary", "comment_text": "bold of you to assume i even have any resolutions", "comment_date": "2019-12-29T20:16:57Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Nate Powell", "comment_text": "I succeeded at a rather difficult resolution and I think part of the reason is because leading up to that year, I had given myself really easy resolutions and succeeded at those, and it made resolution-keeping seem much more possible", "comment_date": "2019-12-29T20:14:24Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Chaoes", "comment_text": "I love how you know your viewers are so nuanced that you had to put that disclaimer on 2020 not technically being the start of a new decade lol!", "comment_date": "2019-12-29T20:13:06Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Makar Lock", "comment_text": "Do the future authoring program :D", "comment_date": "2019-12-29T20:10:55Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Radioactive element", "comment_text": "Love this video.

What I notice though when most people say the end of the decade, they do not make a distinction between simply the 2010s and the chronological 202nd decade, and it seems like many don&#39;t know that there is a distinction at all. Decades, centuries, and millennia all start the same way, ending with a 1, ie 2001 being the start of the 201st decade, 21st century, and 3rd millennium. The 10 year blocks of 10s, 20s, 30s, and so on are simply arbitrary but convenient markers, but we could just as easily label &quot;the&quot; decade as 2015 to 2024 or anywhere else, or even just measure blocks in years of 5, or lustra. What really bothers me the most about these blocks of 10s, 20s, 30s, etc is that if you go all the way back in the calendar to the first 10s, the &quot;decade&quot; before it only has 9 years. It&#39;s like we started counting with a fraction instead of an integer and it doesn&#39;t sit right with me. It just shits all over the first decade. I think people just like it when a 9 flips to a 0 like in a car&#39;s mileage counter. There&#39;s nothing sexy or exciting about a 0 flipping to a 1. The only logical thing to do now is to celebrate both ends of &quot;the&quot; decade.

The resolution is in the habit. Like he said we put the task on a pedestal and make it monumental. I have learned that if I just do one thing I can usually find myself doing a bit more. For instance if my resolution is to exercise more then just start with one pushup, just one situp. Or pick up something heavy just one time. Do that everyday. If you can&#39;t do that everyday then you either have a serious medical condition or you are lying to yourself. As you do them you will find yourself saying hey lets try one or two more. So the idea is that you are doing the task everyday and trying to form the habit. It will take you about 30 days or slightly less to form the habit so once you form the habit you don&#39;t have to con yourself into doing something you don&#39;t want because the repetition is already there.  We don&#39;t want to exercise in the beginning because its tough, but very quickly it gets pretty easy to do. So just start with one. Your mind will say, &quot;Working out for 30 minutes and working up a sweat, hell no; but doing one pushup, situp, or pullup, yeah I can do that. I can spare the time and the energy to do just ONE&quot;. That&#39;s all it takes. Of course you won&#39;t make much progress doing just one but I find that starting is the hardest part. Once you start its easy to keep momentum going. Now here is the part that will happen to everyone. YOU WILL FAIL. Yes thats right no matter if you are superman or batman, you are going to fail. You are going to miss a workout day. Does that mean you stop and say oh well, better luck next year? NOPE. You start again the next day, and you keep going till the habit finally forms. If you are like and your super power is finding a way to procrastinate no matter what with fake busy work then it&#39;s time to get some help and get someone to hold you accountable. That was the only way for me was to hire someone that called me and followed up and held me accountable.

The best way to avoid slipping back into bad habits is to minimize or eliminate situations that will confront you with easy access or the option to indulge.

What you need to realize is that there are 2 complete OVERLAPPING number lines in play here: the AD number line that points to the future and the BC number line that points to the past. We can darn well switch from one to the other if we like. And we can do so wherever we like, including between 2 BC and 0 AD. But that 0 AD is there regardless. And then decades and millennia make sense again.<br><br><a href=\"https://ahcuah.wordpress.com/2014/07/28/when-do-the-teens-end-2/\">https://ahcuah.wordpress.com/2014/07/28/when-do-the-teens-end-2/</a>", "comment_date": "2019-12-28T23:27:44Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "SuperVstech", "comment_text": "The year zero thing is only for millennia, not decades... 2000 was the last year of the 20th century not the first year of the 21st.", "comment_date": "2019-12-28T23:27:13Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Patrick", "comment_text": "My resolution is to work at least 3 hours a day undistracted.", "comment_date": "2019-12-28T23:27:01Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Pavel Lebedev", "comment_text": "YES!

So my new years resolution is to get a job, plain and simple.  I don&#39;t have any habits that need controlling, I will admit that I am out of shape but trying to start an exercise routine is not something that you can do when you have no routine at all.  Since employment is the most important aspect of your life, the routine starts with that.  Everything else then follows.<br><br>And for anyone who might be wondering why I have been unemployed for the last 11 months, it isn&#39;t from lack of trying, although in the first 3 months I did spend too much time on Facebook and binge watching You Tube.  That was a pretty hard habit to kick, but I was fired right at the beginning of the year from a job I thought was my dream job, working at a radio station.    I had volunteered for that station for 7 years before I got that job, and I felt like they really the me under the bus. I fell into a hole of depression so deep, that psychologists are using me as a case study because I have not tried to kill myself.  Ok I made up the last part, but that is how I cope with my depression, by using an emotion that is stronger than it to beat it, whether it be humor, or anger, whatever.  <br><br>Btw if anyone was wondering what my one month of employment was for this year, I worked at a deli.  It was not my life&#39;s gosl but it was my only source of income, and I tried my best to keep it.  The job I had at the radio station, I wss program manager.  My best profession was being a mechanic, I have 10 years experience.  Employers are more prone to hire a rookie fresh or of school so they can pay them minimum wage instead of an experienced technician.

This might be considered a weak goal by the few skilled athletics  reading, but I might extend it.<br><br>My second goal in 2020, might be to learn more stuff that I already don&#39;t know. For example I recently started to learn how to make a website, and I think I will make a blog, if I can complete learning about it.<br><br>Now my third goal of 2020 is to be more active, in the form of going more on camping trips and mountain hikes. The reason why I want to do this is because I think I&#39;m missing out on a loot, and I do live in Norway, which I would call a heaven for travellers, so I want to explore my country more!<br><br>My fourth goal, is to be more politically active in my commune. I can be hard for a foreigner to understand the political system where I live, but I will try to explain it in short terms. My country is divided in regions which there is 5 of, I live in one of those regions which is called Viken. There is multiple communes in each regions, where the commune decides what will happen most of the time, and the region can also be in charge of what will happen inside a commune, but when the region involves itself it&#39;s usually to build a road or something else that will have an effect for the whole region. The commune is controllrd by many people from different parties. But there happens to be a youth group of each party, which is responsible for getting information about what the commune can do better and stuff like that. And I want to join one of those youth parties and learn more about my commune!<br><br><br>So this is the end so far atleast, but for those who read my whole comment, I just want to wish for the best and that you can forfill your goals\ud83d\ude01", "comment_date": "2019-12-28T19:14:28Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Jox", "comment_text": "my resolution for 2020 is to read one Book per Month.", "comment_date": "2019-12-28T19:14:27Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Febride TV", "comment_text": "i will not watch videos just because youtube recommended them to me.", "comment_date": "2019-12-28T19:14:02Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "RazberryTech", "comment_text": "My resolution is to do (1 pull up * the week count of the year) 5 times a week.

I rarely drank any alcohol before, but beeing out with friends it always took decision-energy and arguments to decide if I&#39;m going to drink a beer or not or even a second beer. So just deciding not to drink anything beforehand was just a way to make it easier. Friends stopped trying to get me to drink because they figured it was pointless since I never gave in anymore. I thinm on like 3-5 events throughout the year I would&#39;ve liked to have a beer or a cocktail because it would&#39;ve fit the atmosphere, but it wasn&#39;t really a big sacrifice. The reason I don&#39;t want to drink any alcohol anymore is simply to have more energy because I found that even after a few beers the next day I would feel a little bit more tired.<br><br>For 2020 I will of course continue this no alcohol resolution but together with my girlfriend we decided to add another thing that we feel will give us more enegry and also a better conscience. We both love eating meat and we don&#39;t want to completely stop eating it, but we are also convinced that the meat industry is hurting our planet ecologically, that eating too much and too low quality meat is not good for ourselves and many more arguments. This is why we made the decision to not buy any non-vegetarian product at the supermarket in 2020. Also we will not eat any non-vegetarian fast food. The only way we will eat meat is if we buy high quality, locally produced meat from a farm or when we eat at a good restaurant or are invited to someone else&#39;s place for dinner (We will almost never be able to afford the first two.) <br>So far we have both lived with our parents (where meat is served every day) while we were in university, since we simply couldn&#39;t afford to move out.<br>Now that my girlfriend has finished her studies she is starting to work as a highscool teacher in january and on 2nd january we are moving in together.<br>This seemed like the perfect opportunity to take a more concious look at our diets :)<br>Since we both love meat, I think it will be much harder, than it was for me to not drink alcohol, as I had not dranken much alcohol anyways.<br>But I like the challenge and so I&#39;m 100% convinced that we will stick to it.<br><br>The two reasons why I am so sure are the following:<br>1. Deciding NOT to do something anymore and then following through on it is way easier to do than to start to actually do something every day / week /... Because when you want to do a new thing you have to think of it and then actively convince yourself to do it every time. On the other hand when you just want to NOT do something, you will automatically think about your decision once you are about to do it and then you just have to stop yourself. Meaning you just have to convice yourself to stay passive, which I think is easier then to consistently take action. <br>2. We both decided to do this together and we are both conviced that it is the right thing. So whenever one of us would feel the urge to break the resolution and to buy cheap meat, we can be sure that the other person will of course see it and not be happy about it. So we both have a social control and we don&#39;t want to dissapoint the other :)", "comment_date": "2019-12-28T18:47:13Z", "likes_count": 2}, {"comment_by": "Sagacious Apotheosis BLM", "comment_text": "Good advice but I notice an Inconsistency between how you dealt with nutrition and phone habits.
