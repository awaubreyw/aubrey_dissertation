I just woke up today from a dream where a similar system was being abused (although physically, the victim would see you doing the attack so it made no sense to even try). Anyway, the solution in my dream was to randomize the codes, so that each time you pressed it could be the right code or the wrong code (selected from a pool). Now that I think about it, a better solution would be to have a set of randomly generated codes, make sure the correct code isn&#39;t the last one (or two), then send the discrete codes one by one. That way the user doesn&#39;t have to keep pressing the button like 50 times to open their garage and even if the jammer collects the right code it gets used up and fed a bogus code. To go even further, randomize how many codes get sent. That way the attacker can&#39;t figure out that the correct code will always be one of the first six (as an example) and have a 1/36 chance at opening the garage door (1/6 for the first code 1/6 for the second which isn&#39;t great for the attacker, but still a higher chance than we would like). It&#39;s randomizers all the way down. There&#39;s obviously still some minuscule chance that the jammer can collect two correct codes if the jammer scans at just the right intervals, for example, but I think it&#39;s unlikely enough to be secure for a residential garage home.", "comment_date": "2021-10-24T11:55:01Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Archer Andersen", "comment_text": "I used to want one of these from the book fairs at school but I didn&#39;t have any money", "comment_date": "2021-10-21T03:20:04Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Bruce Cubbage", "comment_text": "I feel this is how &quot;Alexa&quot; (from amazon), works.. but with sound rythem/pitch?", "comment_date": "2021-10-20T00:38:24Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "lostgoldplayer", "comment_text": "Doesn\u2019t lasspass make you login", "comment_date": "2021-10-19T02:15:47Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Bruce Cubbage", "comment_text": "Sammy reminds me of some movie actor, but i cant pin-point the name of the dude!!!

Then the instant a valid code is received all past codes are forgotten in the receiver and are ignored for 2 to power 32 presses. So all previously recorded data strings are now worthless. Secondly the part where they placed junk data in the beginning of the valid data was fake. All chips need a sync period to determine where the data word starts from. The de bruijn sequence will not work on serial data transmission as used in remote controls. Believe me this video is all garbage.

Otherwise, if there were interference between the remote and the door, or the remote was pressed far away from the door, the two would be out of sequence, and you would have to reprogram the remote to the opener before it would work again.

Now the opener is still on N, but the remote is on N+1. On the way home, your toddler presses the remote again. Now the remote is on N+2, but the opener is still on N.\r<br>\r<br>You get home, press the remote, but you&#39;re too far away, so it isn&#39;t received by the opener. The remote is on N+3, but the opener is still on N. So you pull up closer to the garage and press the remote again. The remote transmits N+3, the opener says, &quot;yup, that&#39;s valid&quot; and opens the door.\r<br>\r<br>But here&#39;s the important thing: The opener now says, &quot;OK, I&#39;ve missed a few presses, but I received N+3 as valid, so now THAT is the valid code. The old N, N+1 and N+2 will not be seen as valid.&quot; Both the remote and the opener switch to N+4.\r<br>\r<br>So in your situation, your future code would be &quot;killed&quot; as soon as the opener DID receive a valid code from the remote, which would be pretty much immediately, because the owner would want to get into his garage.\r<br>\r<br>Incidentally, this is also exactly how hotel locks work. The front desk encodes &quot;room 302, rolling code 5&quot; onto your card&#39;s magstripe. You insert the card into the door lock of room 302. The door lock says, &quot;well, I&#39;m still on code 4, but now I see a valid code 5, so I will disable code 4 and switch to code 5.&quot; Now all code 5 cards will open the door.\r<br>\r<br>As soon as another card is encoded for the room, it will receive code 6, which when used in the lock, will disable code 5 and switch the lock to code 6.", "comment_date": "2019-03-11T13:35:35Z", "likes_count": 97}, {"comment_by": "james corvett", "comment_text": "I have a couple of these Im-Me  devices, i always knew they were worth keeping around.

Pfft. I&#39;ve managed to accumulate about a thousand total accounts of various sorts, each with a unique and complex password that uses the maximum allowed complexity for each account. The exception being my fully encrypted Linux computer. I&#39;m not going to type 512 characters just to start booting my computer. However, about one-fifth that I am willing to do. Why? Why not? If someone breaks into my home and steals my computer, I want to make sure my data is safe. If an account gets compromised, I don&#39;t want it to mean any other account gets compromised. The only password manager you will ever need is KeePass. It&#39;s free, works on multiple platforms (including Android), and comes with a password generator that you can use to create unique complex passwords quickly and easily. All you have to remember is one complex password for the KeePass database. Of course, something nobody likes to talk about is general computer security. It&#39;s amazingly easy for an attacker to get a keylogger or backdoor on your computer. Your computer should always be kept updated, which means ALL software on the computer. You should have an adequate firewall (or two). A firewall on the computer and another between your computer and the internet, such as on your router. The firewall(s) should be properly configured. You should have some form of antivirus/antimalware system setup. Your browser should have respectable addons to force HTTPS, block ads by default, and to control cookies/history. uBlock origin, Privacy Badger, and HTTPS everywhere are good for this. Don&#39;t think you could be hacked? Hacks happen, and very often. A good hacker will compromise your computer/account without you even knowing until the damage is done. There are black markets on the dark webs selling stolen credit cards and other personal information. Don&#39;t get caught up in this, take precautions. Nobody is perfect and no system is perfect, but hackers tend to go for easy targets. The harder you are as a target, the less likely you will get screwed. Keep in mind though that any website you input anything of value (such as credit card information) could get compromised and your valuable data could still be stolen and sold. Keep an eye on your financial accounts and credit score. There is a free service that can keep you informed of credit changes. Learn everything you need to do. For example, with my bank, if I notice suspicious activity on my bank account, if I report it within 48 hours, I have no liability. The longer it takes me to notice it and report it, the more liable I become. It also helps to have the phone numbers you need to call to cancel cards inside of a KeePass database that you can access on your phone and computer. That way, if you lose your wallet or it gets stolen, you can quickly cancel the cards. Another note as well, split up your password databases. It&#39;s risky to open a password database containing your financial information on a cell phone while trying to log into some app. Keep your financial information on secured desktop computers. You could have one database for website logins in general, one for financial credentials, one for apps/cell phone related credentials, and so forth. Backup every database often and keep copies on multiple devices, even if you never plan to open them on said devices. The point is that in case one device gets stolen or destroyed in some manner, you still have backups. You can even throw a copy on Google Drive and other &quot;private&quot; online file storage services. The password database is encrypted and the more backups you have, the better.", "comment_date": "2018-10-02T06:03:06Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Doge 2024", "comment_text": "Time to go old fashioned.

This vulnerability is especially dangerous because this is the system that auto manufacturers use for keyless entry systems.

The same thing applies to &quot;smart keys&quot; with engine immobilizers.<br><br>For example, if you figure out the secret key that Ford uses for all of its keyless entry systems, you can break into most Ford vehicles once you capture the key fob&#39;s serial number and button mapping information, both of which are sent in plaintext for some reason. Not that it matters whether the serial number is encrypted or not, since you will have discovered the key anyway. It&#39;s not just Ford that does this, either.

For a hacker, it is even harder to hack than your password manager. If you use a password manager you might as well worry yourself sick about protecting your computer against malicious software because having it hacked would be seriously catastrophic. No need to mention the risk if synced across all your devices. All you need to do is lose one, or use it on an unencrypted network. If you have an algorithm in your head, with one single parameter (easliy remembered, unguessable, that you could even implicitly write down somewhere innocent-looking) for each of them, it is absolutely unbreakable unless intercepted when the password is entered (and that only risk is just as high with a password manager). On top of that, if you are burgled with a laptop containing 320 passwords you haven&#39;t a clue of, there it all goes. Even if the passwords aren&#39;t discovered, you can no longer use them yourself.

I then wrote a tiny bit of C code that runs on the Photon that waits for a signal before triggering the relay. After doing this, I wrote a very simple Android app that sends the signal.

Perhaps not surprisingly, it was a problem very similar to garage-opening codes that led me to the discovery. Old answering machines used to use a 2-digit code to access messages. (Some perhaps still do.) It occurred to me that at least some such machines might use a 2-digit rolling buffer, which led me to wonder whether there might be a string of digits that contained every 2-digit number exactly once. With a little trial and error, I soon discovered my first 101-digit example. I then found more systematic ways to produce such strings in different bases with substrings of different length. Here&#39;s a particularly carefully ordered string containing all the 2-digit sequences from 00 to 99:<br><br>00110221203323130443424140554535251506656463626160776757473727170887868584838281809989796959493929190.<br><br>And here it is again, arranged in a triangle so that the base increases by one with each new line, from bases one to ten:<br><br>00<br>110<br>22120<br>3323130<br>443424140<br>55453525150<br>6656463626160<br>776757473727170<br>88786858483828180<br>9989796959493929190<br>...<br><br>The pattern should be fairly obvious, and could be continued indefinitely.<br><br>Of course, for 2-figure codes (strictly speaking, &quot;digit&quot; applies only to numbers in base ten), the saving, compared to stringing together all codes in full, is rather low, at just under half the figures. For 3-figure codes, it is almost two-thirds; for 4-figure codes, it is almost three-quarters (three-fourths); and so on. The beauty of arranging the numbers in order of increasing base is that the string can be interrupted immediately after the nth zero (n &gt; 1), having produced, up to that point, all 2-figure sequences in all bases up to (n \u2012 1). So, for example, the sequence 0011022120 (interrupted immediately after the 4th zero) contains, exactly once, all 2-figure sequences in bases 1 to 3.<br><br>The same basic principles can be applied just as easily to strings of letters: AABBACCBCA...", "comment_date": "2018-09-20T22:23:13Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "\u00c1d\u00e1m Nagy", "comment_text": "Does Samy own LastPass? :D Sorry, this was evil.", "comment_date": "2018-09-20T22:17:52Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "yrlf", "comment_text": "The next problem with the rolling code systems is that there are a lot of &quot;weak&quot; seeded random number algorithms around and in use.<br><br>With &quot;weak&quot;, I mean that the internal state, and sometimes even the seed, can be recovered after observing a few random numbers, just by analyzing the algorithm and solving some simple equations.<br><br>After that, an attacker can predict ALL future (and sometimes past) codes produced by the device.<br><br>Examples for this are C&#39;s rand() and srand() functions, or Java&#39;s java.util.Random, which can be broken by a second semester CS-Student or anyone spending enough time with it (I&#39;ve done it myself)<br><br>Algorithms like MersenneTwister are harder to break, but there exist public tools even for that.<br><br>What CAN be used for a reproducible, but random looking series of bits is to use a strong encryption algorithm like AES and use it to continuously re-encrypt it&#39;s result, or use a mode like Counter-mode to produce new values.", "comment_date": "2018-09-20T22:08:14Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "QuestionCuriosity", "comment_text": "<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CNodxp9Jy4A&amp;t=1m05s\">1:05</a> that voice crack lol", "comment_date": "2018-09-20T22:06:06Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "The professional Meme God", "comment_text": "Very gud content", "comment_date": "2018-09-20T22:05:23Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Kaleb Bruwer", "comment_text": "2^8 is... *pauses*...*counts*...<br>This is not a real nerd and he can still open your garage door...<br><br>Edit: Okay, so apparently he is Samy Kamkar and is far from stupid, I think he was waiting for you to say 256.", "comment_date": "2018-09-20T21:57:32Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "LOLDONGS", "comment_text": "My garage door isn&#39;t automatic, hack that!", "comment_date": "2018-09-20T21:54:29Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Saosaq Ii", "comment_text": "Never knew \u201ciloveyou\u201d was an possible password", "comment_date": "2018-09-20T21:52:31Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Just milton", "comment_text": "Derek, The Debruijn sequence is awesome.

As if the receiver accepts only  the next code what will happen if the transmitter is out of range and someone presses the button of transmitter ? As now transmitter has moved ahead of receiver.               Well the video lacks a few things here.  Actually there is a synchronization counter C which gets increamented each time you press the key (of transmitter).  Same way the receiver also stores the most recent validated synchronization counter it has received (N).   Now when ever you press the key and send the pseudo-random number to the transmitter the transmitter also takes the synchronization counter C from transmitter (and to update itself will overwrite N with C).  Now receiver will also produce the Cth code (corresponding to C i mean) and match with the code send by transmitter. There is also rolling window of acceptance for rolling codes say 100 or 1000 or whatever (depending upon which system you using for your garrage or car keys).  Now also note that  C-N &lt;= window  of acceptance.   Hope you are getting my point here. Means if you window of acceptance is say 1000 and you press your key 1000 times when you were out of the range then the garrage (or your car or whatever) will ignore the key even if you come back to range.   Also note that if press the key and hold it pressed it keeps emitting same bits, its only when you press it again (press, release the button and press again) that you are generating a new code.  The attack works because the tranmitter checks if the next number is what falls in the sequence and there is no concept of expire due to time here (like we have in one time passwords sent to phone).", "comment_date": "2018-09-19T16:13:43Z", "likes_count": 605}, {"comment_by": "Noland Ryan", "comment_text": "LAST PASS gets hacked then you are F*CKED", "comment_date": "2018-09-19T16:12:39Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Jarred Random", "comment_text": "Reupload?

CPU&#39;s are able to handle bit shifting faster than, as far as I&#39;m aware, every other operation it carries out.<br>As bit shifting is the equivalent to preforming a multiplication factor of two, it&#39;s more efficient to bit shift say 7 times than to do a multiplication of 64 on the number 1. The reason why it&#39;s faster is because the arithmetic unit of the CPU needs to switch more bits than bit shifting does, which only switches a few bits - as bit&#39;s are in the format of: 1-&gt;2-&gt;4-&gt;8-&gt;16-&gt;32-&gt;64-&gt;e.c.t. but in reverse.<br>Take for example; 01000000, this is the equivalent to 64. Lets take the number 1; 00000001, and left bit shift it 8 times: 10000000 - this is 128. Note that all the cpu would have to do is flip the first bit and the last bit (bit 1 and bit 8), the arithmetic unit - again - would take more time to do this.<br><br>It is possible to do any multiplication - not just a multiple of 2 - with bit shifting, but it&#39;s very inneficient.<br>E.g:<br>multiplication of 35 of 2 (which = 70):<br>1. find the nearest power for 2^ to the multiplication number and store 2^ the number you found and store it. I.e. 6 -&gt; 2^6 = 32<br>2. do the multiplication number, minus the above one and store it. I.e. 35-32=3<br>3. do the inital number multiplied by the new above number and override it, we don&#39;t need it anymore. I.e. 2*3=6<br>4. do the inital number multiplied by the first number and override it. I.e. 2*32=64<br>5. Add the result of step 3 to step 4. I.e. 64+6=70<br><br>E.g. 2 (in C#):<br>//72 of 7<br>int intitial = 7;<br>int multiplication = 72;<br>int A = 0;<br>int result = 0;<br><br>//step 1<br>//while(pow(2, A) &lt;= multiplication){//2^0 = 1, 2^1 = 2, 2^2 = 4, 2^3 = 8, 2^4 = 16, 2^5 = 32, 2^6 = 64<br>//or better yet<br>A = 1;<br>while((A &lt;&lt; 1) &lt;= multiplication){//1 left shifted once: 2, 2 left shifted once: 4, e.c.t.<br> A++;//...
