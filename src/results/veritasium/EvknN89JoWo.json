Story I was given is the detonator latch was broken so they wrapped it with material similar to strips of leather from what I noticed when it was delivered to the docks, I never held it myself but did inspect the det trigger when I questioned the person who delivered it off the boat. As we were leaving after sitting it down and walking maybe 100-150 feet from it a welder caused a huge spark that ignited fireworks setting next to the suitcase. I ran to get the suitcase but the fireworks exploded and no way for me to get to it. I ended up in the water holding an anchor chain after explaining to the person who delivered it, what it was. I remained under water holding this chain and almost decided it was not the nuke and after what seemed like 30 minutes but was only 12,  it went off sending me in a bubble of water 1/2 way across the bay and did end up crushing my ribs at one point.

Maybe we could actually PUNISH those who misuse that science - also, that &quot;more frequent and severe heatwaves&quot; comment at the end is verifiably false - all you need to do is look back a little further than the records you&#39;re handed by the people making those claims.  Just like they say we have more and more severe storms - I DO like the idea of planting more trees etc, because they are vital to our survival and we should be taking care of our environment - but the actual global averages do not align with what governments and alleged scientists are pushing on the public and what they&#39;ve projected over the last couple decades has been FAR off course.<br><br>Let me say this - those people pushing the &quot;man-made climate change&quot; agenda are the ones who are STILL pumping your environment full of things SO INCREDIBLY MUCH WORSE THAN CO2, making TRILLIONS collectively doing so, and then turning around and telling US (YOU) that we&#39;re (you&#39;re) at fault and WE (YOU, the little guy without trillions or even food in many cases in 2022) need to pay for it.  They&#39;re the ones who own those corporations and factories and such - and they also are not ceasing their activities.   We are inundate with harmful chemicals that are changing our biology and killing off wildlife, and then they lie about CO2 - did you know we&#39;re at record low levels of CO2 in the atmosphere in recorded history?  Right now we&#39;re about ~1000ppm.   It&#39;s gotten a little tiny bit lower in only very recent history, and risen a tiny amount since the industrial revolution - it&#39;s been many times higher in the distant past, and plant growth was explosive, because plants thrive on CO2, thus creating oxygen.  (which anyone who paid attention in elementary school or middle school knows, unless they stopped teaching THAT in public school too).  Photosynthesis ceases at something like 400ppm if memory serves - we aren&#39;t there yet, but it&#39;s an absolute lie that we&#39;re &quot;near the tipping point&quot; - that tipping point might exist with SOMETHING, but it isn&#39;t CO2.  <br><br>For every scientist who pushes this hysteria there is another one, or likely a handful, who think it&#39;s insane and irresponsible to be on THIS of all things, while ignoring our other very real problems that are not even being addressed, caused by the same people and with full knowledge that what they&#39;re doing is wrong and harmful.  Almost all of the politicians who push this agenda also bought and continue to buy coastal mansions in the many millions of dollars.  Do those seem like the actions of someone who think the earth is going to flood in the next few generations???  When parts of the planet heat up, other parts often tend to cool down, there are patterns and cycles, and these have been known about generally for a very long time.  Now they&#39;re being completely ignored, and the scientists who bring it up are ostracized.  <br><br>Under today&#39;s standards, a guy like Galileo would probably HAVE been burned at the stake, and we&#39;re fast approaching that level of authoritarian hysterics today.   From childhood to adult life (age 37) they went from saying there would be several degrees Celsius rise in global average temperatures.  It hasn&#39;t even increased one.  The place you find statistics claiming otherwise take a VERY small segment of time within KNOWN CYCLES, often as small as a couple decades, and present it as definitive proof of global warming.  This is inherently dishonest and NO SCIENTIST ON THE PLANET would not realize this.  There are cycles on top of our planet&#39;s own, that also affect our climate and the earth&#39;s weather patterns - several of them that we know of, and we are still far from understanding all of it - but the impact in comparison to what Nature has done even in our own lifetimes where we haven&#39;t had any SIGNIFICANT global disasters, is negligible at best.<br><br>When the founder of the weather channel speaks out against this hysteria, you&#39;d think people might take note and at least consider his argument - but because governments told people &quot;you&#39;re all going to die!&quot; everyone just kind of ignores that stuff.  It&#39;s honestly pathetic.  We should be trying to save our environment - and a big part of doing that is not starving plant life across the planet - that COULD cause a catastrophic collapse of ...everything that sustains life today.  We aren&#39;t even focusing on it.  They&#39;re LIMITING nitrogen in the soil across Europe and in America, intentionally, by going on about &quot;environmental impact&quot; - and they&#39;re DOING IT DURING A GLOBAL FOOD CRISIS.  Then they just turn and blame Russia and tell the public &quot;Russia is going to kill everyone!&quot; - noticing a pattern here?  <br><br>....I guess that&#39;s all that comes to mind off the top of my head.  All I&#39;m trying to do is get people to use their reason and watch the ACTIONS of the people who tell them this stuff, to determine if THOSE PEOPLE actually believe what they&#39;re saying.  They clearly do not, or they would change the way they live - at the very least they wouldn&#39;t be buying mansions on coasts they claim will not exist in just a few years.  The most prolific of those politicians, own a bunch of them.  Billionaires even more-so.  If we don&#39;t focus on the things (and people) actually destroying our environment, we aren&#39;t going to stop it in time, and now some of those people are doing it in plain view, and even stating their intent is depopulation, like the World Economic Forum &quot;Great Reset&quot; folks, and you can see the effects their policy and heavy-handed action is having right now - you can even see it in America, but it&#39;s going to get a LOT worse even there.  <br><br>Do this: go check out how Ghana, who previously had I believe the fastest growing economy in the world, has just recently lost all electricity and even running water as a result of chasing a fictional &quot;ESG score&quot; because they were promised assistance by global bankers if they &quot;go green&quot;.  It isn&#39;t going well for them, and people are starving TO DEATH - and the world economic forum&#39;s INTENT was this.  The same goes for guys like Bill G/\\tes - who has openly professed he intends to reduce the earth&#39;s population in the near future.  That = murder, by the way, even if you do it by causing famine - which he has also outlined methods of causing.  No one cares about this stuff?  They&#39;re worried about the fundamental building blocks for plant life instead????  Give me a break guys................................... please use your critical thinking ability and harken back to elementary school before running around screaming about the sky falling.<br><br>...and the sad fact is, because it conflicts with what the people who have been screwing them and are probably going to cause their death in the near future (by their own admissions), most people will not read past the second line in the opening paragraph of this comment - which is what makes us akin to fish in a barrel.", "comment_date": "2022-08-13T18:06:31Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "NEO ViSiON", "comment_text": "No chemist must again face the Problem and  figur out how to  dissolve CO2 or make bacteria :D", "comment_date": "2022-08-13T17:47:36Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "PacifierMusic", "comment_text": "If there is a hell, this guy is certainly there.

The more CO2, the better plants grow, which is why some people buy CO2 to release in their greenhouses. CO2 is the most beneficial &quot;greenhouse&quot; gas on earth. Without it, life would not exist. That point is fact, not conjecture. It is entirely arguable that the industrial revolution and its increased production of CO2 is just as responsible for the increase in food supply as Fritz Haber&#39;s fertilizer.  That said, why would someone as intelligent as you advocate for it&#39;s reduction? I distinctly remember in the late 70&#39;s reading so-called climate experts&#39; opinions that a new ice age was coming. Then 30 years later the same experts were decrying global warming! I remember when my mom called me laughing because a global warming conference was cancelled due to a snow storm. Finally, these experts, so frustrated that their models never bore out, changed the terminology to &quot;climate change.&quot;  They&#39;ve built an industry on unwarranted fear.

This politics denigrates the individual, sacrificing some to others, with various justification. In the end, when all excuses for the sacrifices are denounced as immoral or impractical, the final resort is to the use of force, threats. The so-called arguments are a fraud designed to get voluntary surrender to authority. Why? Involuntary servitude is ineffective, inefficient, as a means of producing wealth. It breaks down when people start to think. They question. And the authoritarians ultimately have no reasonable answer. They are left with the opposite of thought, force.

Please keep scrolling if you don\u2019t want to read my opinion about the current paradigm of food production.<br>\r<br>Sadly, science lacks to understand the complexity of natural systems. It tends to separate things from the rest and study them in \u2018lab conditions\u2019, isolated. This is dangerous specially when it comes to nature, where everything is connected and perfectly balanced. Change one thing, and the consequences can be devastating. The whole is much more than the sums of the parts, science should have a holistic approach when it comes to studying nature.<br>\r<br>Take the nitrogen example. Yes, nitrogen fertilizers allow to grow more and helped to increase the world population. But it fails in so many ways, first of all, it sends a clear message: stop worrying about the fertility in your soil, just buy it. This, along other agrochemicals, such as pesticides, fungicides, etc.., and big machinery are the basis of conventional agriculture. Where one patentable solution fits everyone, as long as we still have oil. If you don\u2019t find this odd, maybe its time to consider it. How can the same agricultural practices be used in places with totally different soils, climates and orography?<br>\r<br>C\u2019mon people, we are better than that. Can\u2019t we see that the green revolution imposed in the 60-80 (sold to us as the salvation) was only made to make a bunch of companies more powerful? (Bayer, Monsanto, etc, etc).<br>\r<br>Going back to nitrogen, apart from providing a lush growth for plants (which they do), they also kill the soil life. The consequence is that each year you need to add more nitrogen, thus making the farmers more dependent. Other consequence of making the plant more green and lush, is that insects are more attracted to it (specially if we have acres and acres of fertilized monocultures). So you have more pest, which means more agrochemicals. Also, plants do not only need nitrogen, soil is a complex ecosystem filled with different nutrients and minerals. So reducing all the complexity of soil life and agrarian systems to one product is dangerous, you miss the whole picture!<br>\r<br>So we have quadrupled the world population. But what are we left with? Polluted watersheds, eroded soils, toxic chemicals in our food (cancer), no biodiversity only monocultures (zero ecosystem services), traditional farming wisdom lost, farmers are totally dependent on oil prices and big companies, to such an extent that they can not run their farms anymore because they are no longer profitable (too much inputs, same or less outputs).<br><br>No piece of technology will get us out of this mess, only working with nature. When a new technology is presented as the solution to X problem, don&#39;t trust it, they just want your money. We need a paradigm shift in our food production systems, one that empowers farmers, produce high quality nutrient dense food, regenerates the soil, encourage biodiversity and boost local economy. Let&#39;s understand natural systems and work with them.<br>\r<br>Good news: we know how to do it. Just google terms like: permaculture, regenerative agriculture, holistic management (there are a lot more).<br>\r<br>Anyway, that\u2019s how the world goes.

My point is humans should consider creating/maintaining a more natural environment in their agriculture where fixing nitrogen to form a synthetic fertilizer simply is not a concern.", "comment_date": "2022-08-02T15:06:46Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "OddityDK", "comment_text": "When someone goes on the oh-so popular anti-western rant, my reply is always \u201cFritz Haber, look him up!\u201d - not only is he responsible for feeding half the planet, he is also a perfect example of how things aren\u2019t black/white.", "comment_date": "2022-08-02T15:03:27Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "SKG Anno", "comment_text": "&quot;Fritz Haber was a German chemist who received the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 1918 for his invention of the Haber\u2013Bosch process, a method used in industry to synthesize ammonia from nitrogen gas and hydrogen gas.

What is usually being evaluated is his nationalism as a German.  Others have considered this question, and he has been compared with another ethnic German,   also a prominent scientist, far more prominent than Fritz Haber who, before WW1 was unknown.   As I recall, Haber was helped by Einstein to receive an appointment in Berlin that enabled his work.   They were both Germans and Jews.   For Einstein, being a German was a cultural matter.  Germany was the nation that gave the world great literature, music, and science.   For Haber,  Germany was a great nation in Europe, greater than France and a competitor with Great Britain.  Germany was to be advanced as Europe&#39;s greatest nation and helped to overcome its rather recent unification from a cluster of principalities. So it was natural for Haber to seek to aid German arms when war began in August, 1914.    <br>Haber&#39;s work had great consequences for the world in the development of agriculture that could sustain the world&#39;s growing population.   It also had terrible consequences in the development of poisonous gases as weapons of war.   Thus, it is tempting to evaluate him, personally, by the aforementioned arithmetic.    I view his patriotism as folly and the patriotism of other scientists before and since Haber as folly.  Indeed,  after WW2, a prominent scientist named J. Robert Oppenheimer learned the folly of such patriotism, as did others who helped to develop the first nuclear weapons.

Either we continue to cherish the idea of progress and risk progress itself, or we do nothing and also risk progress itself. It would seem that one choice is better than the other. But when looking at this dilemma more broadly, you begin to notice a dark cloud hovering over the entire theme. That dark cloud seems to be hinting at an inevitability that progress at some point in time, will in fact be halted and this stagnation or complete eradication of progress WILL BE a direct effect of human existence. As hard as this is to contemplate and comprehend, I think its at least worth saying that this problem is by far the biggest threat that I think we should be focusing on the most. But even by saying that I suppose we could overthink the problem or underestimate it, that in and of itself could be the exact reason it comes about in the first place. If only we knew just how much compounding information into our reality would effect us, maybe we wouldnt have done it in the first place. But who knows, maybe we never had a choice to begin with.

This brings into clear relief one of the fundamental limitations of science and technology. Neither the scientific method, nor its application in technology, is able to resolve the question of how to define good and distinguish it from evil. Moral relativism is completely incapable of settling this question, as is philosophical materialism. Who has the wisdom, goodness, and power necessary to establish what is good, and what is the extent of the consequences of departing from that (evil)? That is the core plot conflict that is introduced in the beginning of the Bible in Genesis 1-3, and it drives its account of human history until its resolution in Revelation 19-22.<br><br>Whatever personal conclusion you reach I support your freedom of conscience, and I&#39;m not here to debate anyone.

Ammonia produced by the Haber reaction is a soluble form that feeds plants to grow fast without nourishing the soil or providing micronutrients. It is soluble and highly erodible, and poisons waterways. Its concentrations can kill some soil bacteria. Thus, the use of this kind of nitrogen is not allowed in organic farming. Instead, we use leguminous cover crops that give habitat to the N-fixing microbes and supercharge their contribution. The crops can then be incorporated into the soil to release the nitrogen for the cash crop. Animal integration and composting are also great ways to cycle nitrogen back to the soil without consuming ungodly amounts of energy (fossil fuel), and which are actually regenerative to the farm ecosystem. With proper management, cover cropping and natural inputs produce just as much yield as conventional systems, while being more beneficial to the soil and more resilient to adverse climate conditions (Rodale Institute). I know that this isn&#39;t the main philosophical point of your video, but I think that this idea that the Haber reaction was an amazing thing for the world is a bit of a myth. Cover cropping has been used for thousands of years. The only reason synthetic fertilizer was needed was because of loss of indigenous farming practices and poor land management.", "comment_date": "2022-07-29T00:41:41Z", "likes_count": 586}, {"comment_by": "Arik Magic", "comment_text": "He had no choice", "comment_date": "2022-07-29T00:40:49Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Castaway", "comment_text": "Problem, reaction, solution.

Fires were bigger, droughts were longer, temps were higher, fires were bigger, it\u2019s all available in historical records and yet we ignore this. I find it funny to think we some how believe the climate to normally be a static thing, that somehow only humans bring about change at scale. Governments can\u2019t solve any major problems that their citizens suffer under and have failed to do so for hundreds of years and yet now their are promises that we can somehow solve the \u201cclimate\u201d if only we just give up enough, change enough or do more (or less). Increasingly climate policy is being used to piggy back societal change that doesn\u2019t benefit society and rather centralizes control of our lives while crushing the middle class. The key to solving any climate issue is to make wealthy as many nations as possible, give as many people as possible a chance to climb from abject poverty and to a better quality of life, instead, in the name of climate change, first world nations are pulling the ladders up behind them and preventing billions from achieving some semblance of quality of life because we believe the majority must suffer so we can solve for carbon in our atmosphere.

He had two answers: 1) they sprayed in a way that killed less bees, ( which I saw through as company PR) and 2) fewer insects was good anyway. I protested this, because the synthetic pyrethrins used are lethal to all insects (even beneficial or benign varieties), and harmful to non insects. I also mentioned that fewer insects meant less food for birds, bats, fish, and a myriad other living things that make up the ecosystem, eventually leading to the health of humans.

You pose that as if it is an unanswered conundrum.

In the commercial world, this is what government regulation and inspection is for. This is why it is so important to keep conservative parties out of government as they are more interested in serving the financial interests of the corporations and themselves. Regulation and inspection ensures that corporations utilising scientific discoveries and scientific staff adhere to ethical standards. Conservative governments reduce regulations and defund regulatory bodies so that these corporations are not hamstrung by ethics and can thus make more profits through unethical uses and abuses of science, not to mention the unethical disposal of waste products. <br>To sum up, the practical application of the academic field of ethical philosophy is what keeps science from being used for harmful purposes. Applying the major principles of ethical philosophy, justice, respect for autonomy, and beneficence to the consideration of whether a particular scientific enquiry or endeavor is ethical is what prevents the harm science could possibly do.

Wherever plants get nitrogen from the soil, at some point a nitrogen fixing plant was there making it (or somewhere else, and the nitrogen got moved there through an enormous array of possible means).<br><br>These plants have a symbiotic relationship with a type of bacteria called Rhizobium, which helps it draw nitrogen in and stores it in a nitrogen nodule in the roots.  Once these plants die and decompose, the nodules release the nitrogen, but now in the useful form found in soil rather than the gas in the atmosphere.<br><br>The problem with this approach for agriculture is the amount of time it takes away from growing a crop of something more valuable.  Nitrogen fixing plants include legumes: peas, beans, alfalfa, peanuts, soy, clover, all of which are easy enough to grow on a farm field (Alder is also nitrogen fixing, but nobody&#39;s going to get very far suggesting farmers plant trees in their fields.)  But if every farm everywhere was taking 1 out of 3 or 4 seasons to grow a batch of legumes, the price of all of them (except clover, which is already effectively worthless) would drop because the produced supply outstrips demand by an absurd margin.  (Most of these are already not exactly cash crops.)  Which means you&#39;ve got a chunk of every season where the field is effectively producing nothing of value - maybe forage for livestock.  Hence this tends not to be a part of farming for most crops.<br><br>The place where it is useful is in farms that need spacing between crops and want ground cover to control weeds.  Hops, for example.  Berry bushes, probably.  Grow clover (probably the  in between the plants and you&#39;ve got a local supply of nitrogen fixation.  It&#39;ll take a while for the decomposition cycle to kick in, and you might want to go with an annual variety if you&#39;re actually planning on using the nitrogen from that rather than having it as a potential long term fringe benefit (the annual has to be reseeded every year, but last years plants will be decaying and releasing nitrogen at a steady rate.)", "comment_date": "2022-07-27T21:45:52Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "TheLaroute", "comment_text": "So he&#39;s just full of sh*t and didn&#39;t save anybody, great, nice clickbait", "comment_date": "2022-07-27T21:45:24Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "avneet12284", "comment_text": "The idea that someone else would have figured it out is so disrespectful and whimsical.

The ice ages where the temperature dropped more then 5 deg C below our average (peak to peak ~ 6 C) does show a carbon dioxide change, however; since we do not see a relationship for our plus or minus ~ 2 to 3 deg C change then likely the change in carbon dioxide is driven by the other effects of a much colder and snow covered climate.

Human emissions are outside of the natural cycles of Earth, so non-natural cycles must be used to offset our emissions. We haven&#39;t disrupted Earth&#39;s natural cycles alone, we have outdone and gone far beyond, creating our own Human cycles are the only way to fix what we have done. &quot;Carbon Neutral&quot; is a trope, we need to fix our own mistakes, we need to offset for ourselves plus everyone else not helping. Even those are not enough because no amount of individual carbon offset is going to offset a tanker transport or even one war. We need entire industries dedicated to these. I tell you plainly, we are not smart enough because too many people will not help, so the Earth&#39;s systems will re-balance themselves while we constantly play catch-up, only to realize we were one step too late at each step. <br><br>To undo something, effort must be equal to or greater than what created it.

But as you reported yourself, Haber immediately commercialized the process in his own name to accrue great wealth, and then doggedly directed that wealth, his energy, and led others into chemical weapons research to murder hundreds of thousands during his life, and millions of his own heritage after his death. Haber directly shaped the results of his research, and his later actions destroys any credibility to the argument of non-selfish intentions for his nitrogen process research. Decent scientists abhor the atrocities committed with their inventions. Haber personally directed the war crime slaughter of thousands of soldiers until it was redirected towards the Jewish people. The population boom was incidental to his goals of Fame and wealth, though deliberate. The slaughter was his direct goal. You need an ethics committee to keep you accountable for your work.

So it seems like there&#39;s a flaw in that science, somewhere. <br><br>CO2 gets converted to oxygen through photosynthesis which produces energy that is used to fuel plant growth, and then the oxygen is converted back into CO2 by animals through respiration, which produces energy that fuels animal growth. If CO2 increases in the atmosphere, I would expect an increase in plants to happen somewhere. I realize we&#39;re chopping down forests at a stupid rate, and have been since forever, but I&#39;m not sure we&#39;re carefully watching every scrap of land that might be growing more CO2 consuming / oxygen producing weeds than it had been before. And we&#39;ve also eliminated unbelievably enormous numbers of oxygen breathing / CO2 producing fish. <br><br>Given that carbon obviously isn&#39;t nearly the climate change threat that people have been convinced that it is, and given that it is extremely critical to plant and animal life, it seems like deliberately trapping carbon in the ground.. for a really, really long time - might <b>not</b> be a good idea.

He was killed on the cross as payment for the sins of all mankind, three days later He rose from the dead. Forty days later He ascended into heaven where He sits at the right hand of the Father. He is returning very soon, but before He does, Satan, the devil, is coming to pretend to be Jesus/God. Satan is an angel, and he will have certain supernatural powers with which to try to fool everyone. He will, for example, be able to make fire come down from heaven in the sight of men. He will only be on earth a short time before the real King of Kings, Jesus Christ, God in the flesh, returns. When the real Jesus comes we will all be transformed into our spiritual bodies at the same moment. Jesus came in the flesh to offer forgiveness of sins and eternal life to anyone who believes and calls on His precious name!<br><br>if thou shalt confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus, and shalt believe in thine heart that God hath raised him from the dead, thou shalt be saved. - Romans 10:9<br><br>Now when Jesus was in Bethany, in the house of Simon the leper, There came unto him a woman having an alabaster box of very precious ointment, and poured it on his head, as he sat at meat. But when his disciples saw it, they had indignation, saying, To what purpose is this waste? For this ointment might have been sold for much, and given to the poor. When Jesus understood it, he said unto them, Why trouble ye the woman? for she hath wrought a good work upon me. For ye have the poor always with you; but me ye have not always. For in that she hath poured this ointment on my body, she did it for my burial. Verily I say unto you, Wheresoever this gospel shall be preached in the whole world, there shall also this, that this woman hath done, be told for a memorial of her. - Matthew 26:6-13<br><br>Seek ye the LORD while he may be found, call ye upon him while he is near: Let the wicked forsake his way, and the unrighteous man his thoughts: and let him return unto the LORD, and he will have mercy upon him; and to our God, for he will abundantly pardon.<br><br>To anoint your self, the sick, or a building for spiritual protection:<br>Get a small bottle of olive oil and pour off a small amount into a smaller vessel like a vial or baby food jar. Use the rest of the bottle for cooking. Ask the Lord to bless your vial of oil in Jesus name. Anoint yourself with the oil by placing a dab of oil on tip of finger and touch it to your forehead, and ask the Lord to bless you/heal you. Place a dab of oil on your finger and anoint the door posts and order all negativity and evil out of the house, and order that nothing negative or evil can enter into your home including piggybacking on a person entering, order it  to be so in the name of Jesus. Anoint all potential entrances to your home. To anoint the sick, place oil on tip of finger and touch it to the head of the sick and say a prayer of healing over them in Jesus name.

There was indeed a salt peter war. Chile could beat Peru and Bolivia. The latter lost his access to the ocean. And Chile won the monopol. The British realized that they could sanction others by holding up their ships, thus denying them the production of explosives. The french chemist Kuhlmann was the first to oxidize ammonia to nitric acid.<br>Wilhelm Ostwald completed this work further and the Ostwald Process, formation of HNO3 out of NH3, was born. In the meantime Haber and the BASF engineer Carl Bosch ramped up the Haber Bosch process. Ostwald even hinted the german Army leaders to support their work. He was aware of the problem of a salt peter shortage.<br>As a precaution Germany had built up a stock of 900 000 to sodium nitrate. Haber had to give a formal comittment to the staff of generals, early in 1914.<br>And he told them, no worry we will have enough ammonia and nitric acid. So it went. The 900 000 tons of NaNO3 as a sole supply would have lasted only til early 1915.<br>As to chlorine, Haber did not develop it. The chemical has been used for many years. And its properties were well known. But there was an excess stock, as it was a by product with not sufficient use.  He just told the army how to get rid of it.

It is incredibly irresponsible for a scientist to frame their learning as simply learning for learnings sake and then turn the other way (or in the case of Haber actively participate) when someone tries to use that line of learning for destruction rather than creation. Scientists working on things like military research are actively doing harm, no matter how they try and distance their experiments from the actual killing in the end, and framing things in this way is just plain bad. Yes Haber is not solely to blame for the entirety of the war or even chemical weapons, but he is unambiguously at moral fault for actively participating in the effort to more effectively kill other human beings.

Like the video said he got lucky. It just so happens a chemist working on this problem just so happen to have access to ozmium a rare material. Also the fact that he recognized that the material would be a candidate for his catalyst. Then afterwards he was able to secure the supply of that rare resource, and successfully scale up his experiment for commercial use. All without to many hiccups, or accidental death at any point in the process. I&#39;m sure it was somewhat secret at the time of how it was done. I don&#39;t think progress of tech and science is a sure thing. I think we get lucky alot. And again Luckily now adays we share discoveries to ensure we don&#39;t lose those steps forward. I think  tge widespread progression of technology didn&#39;t start to take off exponentially until literacy rates have gone up and trade routes secured. Sure there would be savant and geniuses and random breakthroughs, discoveries that were important to the state or a group or even those individual would be most likely secret and consequently lost due to one thing or another. But real progress is when a technology or practice becomes widely adopted by a population or atleast spread to other specialists elsewhere. Communication, luck, and hardship drive innovation and the preservation of progress in my opinion.

Because there is a sector of ufology where the extraterrestrials unbearably acquire the hypocritical character of preaching and exhorting Fathers where they preach to us: Humans are a danger to the universe, irresponsible, polluting and warlike. Beware of chemical wars, beware of global warming, beware of nuclear energy. More love, more solidarity, less wars. They are in quarantine and penance for their low vibrations. Pollutants. If they don&#39;t change there will be a total extension.... &quot;This is seen from Asthar Sheran to Chico Xavier to Swaruu, from a famous appearance on the Uritorco mountain in the eighties, to the famous movie The Day the Earth Stood Still, (where in the recent remake the nature of Kenee Revee is closer to the real one than in the Matrix). But let&#39;s expand our consciousness and tie up loose ends. Aren&#39;t we run by a perverse elite tele directed by Aliens? call it deep state, caval, illuminati, or that they went to Antarctica? Are not the Anunnaki the DTs of the Illuminati who gave them the mandate: I destroyed faith, religion, morals, so that far from God we have license for total destruction. Things they do with a blind obedience their entourage of pornographic artists, making apology to Homosexuality, abortion, adultery, drugs, paganism, witchcraft.... (Artists who think they will be saved from chaos because they wear illuminati slippers, they would be adducted by ships in chaos as they show in a video... ha!) But beware, also the unarguable and unpresentable economic reset, the 5G, the virus, the AI all have an obvious and natural ET origin. (Demons, Fallen Angels, pagan gods, the lifelong enemies of Yahweh) They were told to leave only 10% and reign over them, but the plan is to betray the Illuminati, eliminate that 10%, eliminate the elite itself, to be able to say: &quot;mission accomplished. Finish with Yahweh&#39;s creation.&quot; I caught that in many sinics, they put you in a trap and when you fall they say to you: &quot;fool because he falls&quot; My father was like that and in the long run he was their pawn, like father, like son....

IN THE LIGHT OF CHRIST. LET US FIRST OF ALL STRIVE FOR HUMAN PERFECTION IN OURSELVES. AND THUS WE BECOME A TRUE LASER CANNON AGAINST THE ANUNAKIS THEMSELVES, BECAUSE IF MAN TURNED OUT WELL FOR GOD, HE DEFENDS HIS HUMANITY. HE DEFENDS HIS HUMANITY FROM THE PARAPHERNALIA OF THE ANTICHRIST TO EXTERMINATE THE POPULATION. THE LANTENTE POWER THAT YOU HAVE MAKES THE LAVISH ANUNAKIS SHIPS SHAKE. DO YOU KNOW HOW MANY TIMES GOD HAS TO SNAP HIS FINGERS SO THAT THEY FALL DOWN, OR FROM ABOVE AN ASTEROID FALLS ON THEM...? Let&#39;s stimulate... let&#39;s try... Let us induce such an order with an unimpeachable morality as a kind of holy and sweet revenge not to be trapped by the devil in any, be malicious with the evil one, let reason dominate emotion and body and the rudder of all be the spirit. Love with obedience to Yahweh and then to Jesus there he beat the devil in all. For religions are under Lucifer disguised as Jesus.<br>Finally I add this: My angels made me realize only by relating data that the miracle cure offered by Christian Amenophis of putting magnets on your feet is actually counterproductive, I told him in networks and attention in his last video he said &quot;some suspect me that I ...,...,......&quot; (vulgar aberration) and then added: no one will be saved from what is coming .... Not even you, even if your name is Juan.... What is my name? John! with a strict logic but implicitly he is not recognizing it and giving the reason to my angels? Jesus fixed it at the end pure traps....<br>And don&#39;t say anything else only Elijah would come but the world will reject him... they prefer teachers with possessed faces that flatter and praise him and sell colored mirrors but you are different show it and let&#39;s take the bite out of the devil&#39;s throat and leave your empty gravedigger&#39;s shovel with the life that Jesus brought which includes that the spiritual gives way to the reason and the emotion. All that needs to be done for God to defend this humanity and 20,000 other things the Holy Spirit will tell you. Connect with him. God bless you and see you soon. GLORY TO GOD.

Regenerative agriculturists claim that farms can be sustained without the haber bosch process and the only reason farm lands get depleted is because heavy tilling, and adding the salty fertilizers destroy the micro biome in the soil, making it dependent on synthetic, haber-Nitrogen.

If in this time 3-10 kids getting influenced the right way and being taught that you should respect everything and everybody you reduce the risk of bad people on this world.

The only sustainable way of growing healthy food in the amounts we need is through understanding how soil works and how we can improve it`s fertility without the need of chemical fertilizers. And cover crops are VERY capable of producing all the nitrogen we need, simply through growing. And they also provide other nutrients to the soil, that make nutrient dense, healthy food.

He was also a Hasidic Jew with a wife and children. So he helped engineer the mass production of Phosgene because he couldn&#39;t take care of his family while freezing to death in an unheated prison cell...<br>Because of this, my grandfather&#39;s father, wife and children were banned from the US, and from working in his field outside of Germany and as a Jew was essentially banned from professional work.

After his field hospital was involved in their second concentration camp liberation, he wrote the medical protocalls for treating the survivors. Because he spoke fluent German and French, my grandfather like a lot of German Jews acted as an interpreter for the Army, which is when the US Government learned that his family was in the US without legitimate paperwork, but it took no action....<br>After the war, my grandfather delivered over ten thousand healthy children over his career, in addition to the deliveries in Europe he performed during and immediately after the war. A few tools for performing Cesarean Sections that were designed by my grandfather are still used today. Instead of patenting them he made them public domain.

This invention is important for the large-scale synthesis of fertilizers and explosives. It is estimated that two thirds of annual global food production uses ammonia from the Haber\u2013Bosch process, and that this supports nearly half the world population.[5][6] Haber, along with Max Born, proposed the Born\u2013Haber cycle as a method for evaluating the lattice energy of an ionic solid.

Secondly, Haber discovered the lethal use of chlorine gas and used it at Ypres and technically threw the first stone. But the French had used tear gas a year earlier so he saw it as revenge. Then the British invented phosgene, a more lethal chlorine based gas so the Germans discovered mustard gas to incapacitate the British. It truly was not as one sided as it first appears and by the end of the war everyone was using mixtures of all three in warfare: British, French, German, Russian and Austrian. Thirdly, the initiation of chemical warfare in WW1 is speculated to have saved more lives than harmed, a strange theory I know but hear me out. Hitler refused to use chemical weapons in WW2 because of his experiences with gas in WW1. This is very significant because we discovered after WW2 that Germany had an immense stock of nerve agents well beyond the level any of the Allies had. During the wartime, the Nazis had developed a series of organophosphate based nerve agents like tabun and sarin which might have won Hitler the war. They were colourless, tasteless and highly lethal in small doses. So every cloud has a silver lining.

For some background,  during the Cambrian Period, millions of years ago, the levels of atmospheric Carbon Dioxide were a little higher than our current amount of around 400 parts per million. Back then, it was over 4,000 parts per million(too many SUVs?)  The Cambrian was also known for a veritable explosion of new life on Earth. Over long periods of time, that abundance of life giving CO2 became sequestered into rock, like limestone and marble. By the 1880s, atmospheric CO2 had dropped down to dangerously low levels, around 180 ppm.  When CO2 goes down to only 150 ppm, almost all plant life on Earth dies. No more oxygen is created. All creatures that breathe will then die off. Thankfully the CO2 levels are back up to a better number(though still low) of about 420 ppm. The Earth is getting greener, as plants thrive at higher levels of CO2, as that is how most of them evolved.  Most commercial greenhouses pump in CO2 at about 1,000 ppm. Research this. As for sea levels, the charts for NY Harbor show that levels have risen at the same rate, year after year,  since before Lincoln was President. SUVs again?  So  Forest fires in the U.S. burned 10 times more trees in the 1930s than today(listen to Tony Heller YouTube).  The 1930s was also the decade that was far hotter than this one. Dust Bowl, anyone? Don&#39;t forget, in the 1970s,  government scientists wanted to coat the North Pole with mega tons of coal dust because they predicted we were entering an Ice Age(Leonard Nimoy narrated a film on this). Right. What about deadly hurricanes far worse now than ever? Research the hurricane that hit the Florida Keys in 1934, or the Great New England Hurricane of 1938. Worst year known for hurricanes? Try 1780, and the storms hitting the Caribbean  including the Great Hurricane of 1780. Over 28,000 people died that season. So. There are many actual scientists that are not pushing the government/corporate media propaganda. I would recommend Richard Lindzen, Patrick Moore (cofounder of Greenpeace), Ian Plimer, Willie Soon, Peter Ridd(Cook College), Freeman Dyson, William Happer, Tony Heller, and for a funny and informative vid, try the longer version of Mark Steyn discussing his lawsuit with Michael Mann, the creator of the disproven &quot;Hockey Stick&quot; graph, purporting to show that the temperature of the Earth has remained constant over 2,000 years. No Roman Warm Period? No Medieval Warm Period? No Little Ice Age from early 14thvcentury, to mid 18th century?  &quot;Yeah right. That&#39;s the ticket.&quot;  Cheers...", "comment_date": "2022-07-24T05:22:44Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Blaceralia", "comment_text": "we cant", "comment_date": "2022-07-24T05:22:17Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Resync29", "comment_text": "Waiting for the days where we can have a video about Ancel Keys and how his arrogance impacted the health of people around the world for the next 70 years (and hopefully no longer) by cherry picking data from a not so randomized study and fiercely fighting off critics that had found several flaws in it...", "comment_date": "2022-07-24T05:22:10Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "ASDF", "comment_text": "Is this what Vandana Shiva keeps talking about ?", "comment_date": "2022-07-24T05:21:33Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Jonathan Williams", "comment_text": "So The Hague Conventions only banned gas projectiles not the gas itself?", "comment_date": "2022-07-24T05:21:00Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "N\u00a0", "comment_text": "Now we are all sons of bitches", "comment_date": "2022-07-24T05:18:55Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "whogivesacrapaboutastupidchannelgoogle?", "comment_text": "As soon as you started with the carbon footprint garbage, you lost credibility.

The problem I see is that while humanity has developed amazing technologies, our ethical and sociological evolution has failed to keep step with technology and science. <br><br>When it comes down to the wire a single human, as well as society as a whole still has a tendency to first think on its own survival. <br>A single human in a large group of humans sealed in a cave will find it nearly impossible not to think about gulping that last breath of breathable air in the sealed cave, even if it means killing off all others as well. <br><br>We find it so hard to make the sacrifices that will be detrimental to ourselves but to aid the survival of a group at large. The horrible yet ethical choice for a large group would be to find volunteers to kill themselves so others would have more oxygen left over, so that in the increased duration supplied by that there may be a chance of rescue. Because we see the ethical problem of someone giving their life so others may possibly be saved. Soldiers and firefighters are amongst a handful of people who actually sign up, knowing that they may be forced to risk their lives so that others may live. <br><br>The destinction however is that soldiers know that they also may have to kill other humans to do their duty, determined simply by a fairly uncaring superior who again recieves orders down the chain of command, right from the top, where political decisions decide the fate of both the soldiers fighting on their own side, as well as other humans involved with these soldiers.<br><br>Firefighters on the other hand DON&#39;T sign up to kill others; their job description is to put their lives at as little risk as possible while saving as many people as possible.<br>There is no &#39;better or worse&#39; between the common soldier and the common firefighter. <br><br>But from a societal standpoint, if we could make wars extinct by making EVERYONE recognize that wars never bring anything good, except destruction, and that cooperation is much more preferable, then we could abolish soldiers as well.<br>Until we reach that point in our societal ethical development it is unfortunately utopian, wishful thinking.<br><br>In the same way larger groups will find ways to implement their own survival over and beyond the survival of other groups first. Whenever any resource that defines survival becomes limited humans as individuals, as well as larger groups, right up to blocks of nations, STILL think in &quot;us vs them&quot; categories, not in &quot;who has the greatest chance of survival if looked at rationally&quot;. Because the &quot;us vs them&quot; mentality is easier to understand and to emotionally bond with. Because the &quot;survival of most to the detriment of some&quot; is ethically problematic, but might become a necessity in a world growing constantly more crowded.<br><br>We as a humanitarian total have to develop from the Neanderthal mindset of &quot;me first, then my loved ones, then possibly my neighbors and friends, then possibly all the other unwanted ones.&quot; Our ethical and moral compass has to evolve. We cannot delve into more and more destructive measures just to gather more resources for our own little group.<br>We have to begin thinking like a whole.<br><br>It will be difficult to survive for humanity as whole otherwise.", "comment_date": "2022-07-24T00:41:30Z", "likes_count": 105}, {"comment_by": "thewhat", "comment_text": "Millions &lt; Billions", "comment_date": "2022-07-24T00:41:12Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Smokin4CHRIST", "comment_text": "My Carbon footprint is negative, that is fact.

Looking back on someones decisions in life and judging them with the knowledge of today is pretty flawed. Condemning someone from the safety of ones own peaceful home is easy. But good and evil are at the end of the day two sides of the same coin. And most people beleave themself to be on the side of good. Being very patriotic was normal at the start of the 20th century. So doing everything in your power to make sure your country does not lose a war cant by itself be condemned. There usually is only two outcomes to a war. Your country loses or it wins. Trying to prevent destruction and suffering in your own country is most of the time synonymous with bringing destruction upon someone else. Condemning Haber means you have to also condemn Oppenheimer for example. We should not let the victor of a war determine who was good and who was evil. Because that leads to a distorted view on history. The real evil are not humans or science. It is war itself. War knows no real victor. Everyone loses at the end. It brings out the worst of humanity on both sides. So stories like the one of Fritz Harber should be a lesson to us that righteousness is to a large degree in the eye of the beholder. It is important to always question ones own motives. And most of all it is a lesson to never resort to violence in the first place.<br><br>Also some additional facts: While chemical weapons have a terrifying reputation and for good reasons (they kill people in very nasty ways after all), they were rather ineffective in the grand scheme of things.

I guess because quick death (nuke) is considered more humane than a slow and excruciating death (chemical), even when the former can kill many more much faster.

This would then prompt the enemy to wear gas masks to protect themselves from it.

You show elegantly that nothing is ever black-and-white. <br><br>For me, it seems that the use of synthetic fertilizers themselves are a double-edged sword (perhaps more;how many edges can a sword have?). <br>There are many short-term benefits given by synthetic fertilizers, but they are being shown to cause larger and larger issues. As often happens, simple solutions are causing ever increasingly complex problems. Over-fertilisation and over-use of soils is depleting them of available micro-nutrients. Plants need these in the same way that we need them. If they&#39;re only given a few key minerals, those needed for fast growth, they will have compromised immunities and will need to rely upon ever-increasing amounts of herbicides and pesticides.<br><br>Small farms are dying off by the dozen, because nobody but the large companies can afford the ever increasing cost and need for synthetic fertilizers and pesticides, much less compete on price.<br><br>It&#39;s the biology in the soil that can fix nitrogen from the atmosphere, break down minerals in the soil to plant-available forms and food it to plants only when they need it. <br><br>The alternative, this current model, is to give the plants what we think they need, hope they uptake it, and watch it wash into the rivers the next time there&#39;s a thunderstorm.

This is a cop out.  I believe you have a responsibility to answer that question.  Otherwise, you\u2019re just like every other guy \u201cjust asking questions, man\u201d.  . . . Also, it is a cliche (and another cop out) to assume that if this particular scientist hadn\u2019t invented this particular weapon that another scientist somewhere sometime somehow would have invented it anyway.  Is it likely that this would happen?  Perhaps.  Is it certain?  Not at all.  What would be the evidence for any certainty on this matter?  . . . On the other hand, I do believe it is our duty as scientists\u2014and especially as science educators\u2014to take a real stand on this issue.  Do you support scientific endeavors which are designed specifically to destroy human life and cause human suffering?  Is this ever an acceptable use of science?  My answer, for whatever it\u2019s worth, is no.  . . . Especially now.  Especially when the climate crisis is already ramping up, and it\u2019s catastrophic effects are touching down.  Especially when we are yet again faced with the real possibility of multilateral nuclear world war.  Especially when the stakes are so very high.  How can you just be asking questions?  How can you not take a stand?  How can you shy away from proclaiming your ethical standards?  . . . We must\u2014if not long ago, then now\u2014we must be better than this.  For far too long scientists have hidden themselves in the false notion that their work was divorced from ethics.  Divorced from causality.  Divorced from humanity.  Their work, their science, and they themselves were never divorced from humanity.  . . . Maybe someone somewhere somehow will invent some new weapon that will destroy life in ways we can never even imagine.  Or maybe not.  Maybe they will decide not to.

We do NOT have the capacity within ourselves to make wise choices about such matters. But, more so in the 20th Century than at any other time, we have abandoned God to go our own way. God&#39;s Word, The Bible, is as relevant today as it has ever been. As &#39;The Teacher&#39; says &quot;The knowledge of God is the BEGINNING of Wisdom&quot;. Knowing God is just the START! How can we know God? The Bible explains CLEARLY that ever since our original ancestors committed the Original Sin (i.e. going our own way instead of God&#39;s) we are increasingly broken people living in an increasingly broken world. God cannot abide Sin, cannot even look at it. Nevertheless, He loves us, and has done all He can and all He needs to, to get us back in the right direction and back into relationship with Him. The death Jesus experienced on the Cross is the death YOU (and me) deserve - complete destruction. But Jesus died this death ON YOUR BEHALF so that you don&#39;t have to, and instead can have your relationship with Him restored. Jesus PROVED this by rising from His Death three days later, the most pivotal and undeniable FACT of history. And it&#39;s handed to us on a plate, nothing we can earn or deserve. God leaves the choice up to you on a personal basis, to either accept His free gift or reject it. It is personally and globally disastrous to ignore spiritual matters. So make your choice, but remember, the universe doesn&#39;t revolve around YOU, you don&#39;t know everything, you aren&#39;t perfect, and there&#39;s nothing you can do about it. But God loves you anyway, and is eager for you to choose Salvation instead of destruction - &quot;Choose LIFE&quot;! The START of doing this is to accept His free gift, to ask Him to forgive your sins, and to ask Jesus - God made Man - to become Lord of every part of your life. Just a simple prayer, spoken wherever you are.

In fact, those who claim to be the ideological if not biological descendants of the former, who are often also the latter (for example, Christopher Wren, who was an Invisible College Freemason as well as a founding member of the Royal Society, incorporated &quot;sacred geometry&quot; and Kabbalah into his building projects. Sacred geometry was also used in the building - directed by medieval Roman Catholic priests - of some of the most famous cathedrals in Europe. Contrary to the disinformation spread nowadays, the priests were NOT &quot;duped&quot; by Knights Templar surreptitiously placing occult symbols into their work, but in fact, it can be proven that the priests themselves were immersed in the study and incorporation into Christianity of the teachings of pagans like Pythagoras, Euclid and Atistotle, which is the ACTUAL reason there are statues of those three pagans in the exterior of Chartres Cathedral), even admit it: <br><br> &quot;This class is loath to take<br>things on faith and prone to prove all things by the light of reason.

Yet another fantastic video. Thinking about it, civilization needs to remove obstacles in order to grow. Lack of chemical fertilizers was one. Now we need a source of energy that will substitute carbon-based ones, but if we succeed, there will be new barriers. I think it&#39;s time for once to accept as real the concept of our planet&#39;s &quot;carrying capacity.&quot; People dismiss Malthus, who said there will eventually be too many people for population to keep growing, and Nature will ruthlessly curtail our numbers. The truth is more complicated, but the idea is sound. We can expand planet&#39;s carrying capacity, but at increasing cost and effort. However, if we are foolhardy about it, we might sooner or later be unable to come up with a solution to the next barrier, and then a catastrophe will be inevitable. Our seeming inability to come together to reduce CO2 emissions could be that crisis point, but there will surely be others if we pass this exam. That&#39;s why I think that rather than trying to increase Earth&#39;s carrying capacity forever, we need to learn to live comfortably inside some reasonable population limit. In other words, we need to come up with a number of people who can live comfortably on Earth, and bring the population down to and within this level.

(See data and graph from National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration - NOAA NCDC.)<br>Tornadoes strong to 2019.jpg<br><br><br>Contrarian data 2:<br>Northern hemisphere autumn and winter snow extents have been increasing for 50 years.<br>(See data and graphs from Rutgers Global Snow Lab.)<br>NH Autumn snow extent.jpgNH winter snow extent.jpg<br><br><br>Contrarian data 3:<br>There has been no significant increase in the number or total energy of tropical cyclones, over the last 40 years.  (See data from Dr Ryan Maue, meteorologist.). (See also data from \u201cDeclining tropical cyclone frequency under global warming\u201d, by Chand and Walsh et al, June 2022.)<br>Cyclone accumulated Energy.jpg<br><br><br>Contrarian data 4:<br>Arctic sea ice extent has reduced by 16% over the last 40 years, while Antarctic sea ice extent was steadily increasing until the large storm in 2016.  (See data and graphs from:  NSIDC National Snow and Ice Data Center.)<br>Arctic sea ice 3.jpg<br><br><br>Contrarian data 5:<br>Polar bear numbers have been increasing since the 1960s.  (See data by  Prof Crockford.)<br>Polar bear numbers.jpg<br><br><br>Contrarian data 6:<br>Dr John Christy has concluded from the data available that global temperatures will only rise 1.1\u00bac for a doubling of CO2, which is: \u201cnot a very alarming number\u201d.  (See Dr Christy\u2019s public \u2018easy-read\u2019 paper \u201dTropical Skies\u201d.).<br><br><br>Contrarian data 7:<br>CO2 is plant-food, and thus perhaps the most important gas in the atmosphere.

Let me explain, firstly yields have actually started to go down slowly over time, intensive farming requires more and more inputs, eventually at the current state yields are now lower than organic farming.  Healthy top soil with a full ecosystem creates massive amount of nitrogen per hectare.  The further challenge here is that the majority of food comes from intensive big ag.  This is false, refer to Drawdown, this book is effectively a Meta analysis of the data, pointing out several key points, one being that chemical fertilisers atomise into the atmosphere creating the potent greenhouse gas nitrous oxide.  In this video, wrapped into this false narrative is the idea that it\u2019s difficult to feed the human population.  Nothing could be further from the truth.  Over 60 billion land animals raised for food use nearly half of all available agricultural land for just 18% of Calories on the plate or less.  This land is used to grow feed and to pasture these animals.  There are only 8 billion humans so do the math.  All those 60 billion plus animals defecate and urinate constantly creating HUGE amounts of nitrates now killing rivers and creating ocean dead zones across the world.  Climate breakdown is an existential threat, and as the book Regenesis points out if we transisitioned off fossil fuels entirely just the greenhouse gases from our food system alone will blow our carbon budget 2 to 3 times over by 2100,:making Fritz Harbor responsible for the end of humanity.

Perhaps this is not about a scientist who invents an evil thing, but more about society welcoming this evil invention. One of the reasons why Haberman or Germans could use nitrogen in such a horrible way is the collective madness of 1st WW. To do such things one must be delusional in a certain sense. And one man is not enough for this, somebody must approve and grant this project, somebody assist, somebody must authorize the use, public and journalists must support repetitive using. It must be collective madness. But as you said, for example, Einstein stayed out of the war. Maybe it is somehow a personal appeal for all of us, not just for scientists.<br><br>One way how to prevent such horrors possibly could be to build a society in which such stupid things would be unthinkable basically for anybody. But I am very skeptical about that. Here is why: Cause, when I see Lenon with his slogan &#39;War is over if you want it&#39;, it is like saying &#39;wake up, people - look what you&#39;re doing&#39;.

What happened to its &quot;loans&quot; now that this pipeline is defunct is not clear.<br><br>In 2015, 1 year after Russia invaded Ukraine, Wintershall sold off its german gas storage facilities to Gazprom, in exchange for more russian methane. These gas storage facilities are 25% of all gas storage facilities in germany (270TWh), and it was exactly these gas storage facilities that were deliberately left empty in the summer and fall of 2021. Wintershall was/is a 100% daughtercompany of BASF.<br><br>In the past 30 years, BASF has lobbied German and European politicians extensively to increase Europes dependency on methane. Plentiful methane for energy, means cheap methane for the Haber-Bosch process that BASF makes so much money on.<br><br>With the advent of the &quot;Great Coalition&quot; of catholics and socialists in 2013, the expansion of renewables in germany was stunted, and Russian gas imports were increased. Today, we could have had 75% more solar and 25% more wind generation capacity installed in Germany, if expansion had kept the same level as their respective peaks in 2012 and 2017 (wind has about a 5y delay). This lost capacity is measured against flatlined expansion, and not the exponential growth we were seeing before. Just when massive german taxpayer investment from the previous 10-15ys started to pay off, all of the german solar and wind manufacturing industry and the whole economy around it was wiped out. Renewables were working, and threatened the future of fossil methane, and therefore it got dispatched.<br><br>Thanks to the lobbying of the likes of BASF, the CDU/CSU and SPD made Germany extremely dependent on russian gas, and this is one of the key enabling factors for the current oligarch regime in Russia, and thus the war in Ukraine.<br><br>Haber-Bosch requires hydrogen. This hydrogen is mostly created from methane, through steam reforming. Producing fertlizer, through SMR and Haber-bosch produces 1-1.5% of global greenhouse gas emissions.<br><br>BASFs Ludwigshafen plant has a direct pipeline connecting to the rest of the gas network reaching all the way to Siberia. Actual data is hard to come by, but BASF&#39;s ludwigshafen plant alone is claimed to use 37TWh of Methane in 2020. 2.1% of all of german methane imports, or more than 6% of the part of methane imports not used for home heating and electricity production, or 14% of the capacity of german storage facilities.<br><br>The SMR process (Steam Methane Reforming) is about 74% efficient. I found one paper estimating various energy sources and the energy overhead these various sources incur, and it guesses that getting methane out of Siberia into Germany wastes about 20%. This means that getting hydrogen out of Siberian methane is 61.67% efficient, which is an efficiency that is achievable with electrolysis, when powered with excess renewable energy. But that would mean that BASF would have to invest heavily in its infrastructure instead of passing on massive profits to its shareholders now.<br><br>German households had their gas prices hiked up 50% already, and that&#39;s before the full cost is allowed to be passed on to consumers as that is legally limited at this time. The cost of methane for consumers has already reached a level where a heatpump only needs a COP of 3 to be on cost parity using grid electricity. In 2021, BASF had its revenue rise by a third, to 78B EUR, and its profits doubled to 7.88B EUR. And yet germans are supposed to turn down their radiators and take colder shorter showers to help save on gas to help sustain such companies.<br><br>Between BASF and Bayer, between indiscriminately chemical over-fertilizing and chemically killing everything, we have turned our farmers into lazy chemistry applicators and turned our soils into toxic deserts. No life remains, neither microbial or anything higher order, and the organic matter is disappearing fast, removing the ability for soils to retain water and nutrients.

My carbon emissions? Hey, I use public transport on a daily basis to commute to work. I also drive an electric car. At the same time, I realize that in order for the car to be actually better for the environment, I must make at least 160 thousand kilometers on it, because of the environmental impact during its production. Based on my driving, it will take another 14 years (I own the car from new, it is 2 years old). I do not have an AC in ma flat, even though I suffer 31\u00b0C temperatures in my flat during these heat waves. Which give me sleepless nights. I separate all my trash. I do not buy a new phone when a new model comes out. On the contrary, I use it until it breaks. My computer is from 2014 (desktop system) and although I was about to upgrade it, I did not do so. It was not the most powerful back then and today it is obsolete, but still it manages to do what I need of it, even though one game has low FPS). What I dress is being frowned upon by peers, I am not &quot;modern&quot;. That does not mean I wear dirty things, nor that I smell bad. I take regular showers, although not every day (OK, now in summer it is more often than in winter). I try to save water. I was myself in cold water. Not because I do not have warm water running (I do), but because I want to save energy. I am still privileged to live in a developed country in central Europe. I am not feeling bad about myself, even though I have a feeling that I consume more energy than the average human being. But I am still aware there are millions of humans whose impact on this planet is even worse. I would never want an SUV. I have a little city car and that is only because of my own comfort and laziness. I am guilty. I know. But I do not feel bad. I forgive myself. I grew up in a society, a culture, which was build around &quot;plenty&quot;. At least my ancestors did not colonize and conquer other, less lucky people. In fact, they were serfs and only wanted to be free, to live on their land and provide for themselves, not exploiting others. We were being viewed as &quot;lesser&quot; people by Nazis. We still are viewed as poor 2nd class Europeans in the minds of &quot;the west&quot;. I remain indifferent towards this observation. Because human history has always been about &quot;us&quot; vs. &quot;them&quot;. The narrative is deeply rooted in our very species. But not only in ours. There are other species capable of what we call Holocaust. They just do not have the knowledge, science, technology, resources to utilize it. Practically all life is a &quot;disease&quot;. What is its purpose? To survive? To thrive? BS. The only &quot;purpose&quot; (if you want to call it that) is to accelerate the disorder of the universe. All our energy basically exists because there is this energy potential, or difference, that we can tap into. And life has found ever and ever better means of how to do it, to get an evolutionary advantage. It is absolutely natural that we exploit the resources we have at our disposal. Every other living creature would do the same, if it had science, technology, resources. We are inherently flawed. And so am I, just one member of this great set of people. But! I am an evolutionary dead end. I will not reproduce. But at least I will use up a significant amount of resources on this planet, because I am quite lazy and want to live in comfort. Not it a cave. It is not that I do not want to reproduce, but finding the proper mate has been unsuccessful over more than two decades. And now I am too old. And cynical. And maybe that is for the best. Here, world, have me. The unwanted man, existing as a parasite of life. Or better would be the nowhere man. Making all my nowhere plans for nobody. Writing this comment for nobody. I do not expect anyone to read this far. Heck, I do not expect this comment to be actually displayed to anyone other than me, when I am logged on. Because of hidden censorship on YT that I have witnessed much too often. Why bother with pressing keys with my fingers....? Hmmm. To waste even more energy? To add to the increase of the entropy of the universe by a tiny amount? At the same time, I feel no existential dread. On the contrary. I feel free. Free. At the cost of being alone and lonely. My freedom is my ultimate prison where I remain isolated from society. I am worthless. Everyone is. Nothing matters. There is no free will. Superdeterinism remains wrong though. And even if, knowing the final answer to a thousand of years old question does not change the reality. People believe in so many stupid things. Which brings us nicely to their ignorance of their own impact. Because it is natural. It is expected to abuse everything we discover, just to put our existence into more danger, even though we achieve some temporarily advantages. I do not feel depressed. Nor happy. Nor euphoric. Just acceptance. We are what we are. At least we managed to find out so many things. Amazing things. After all those dark times, ruined by superstition, religion and fallacies. Yet we still are as we were. Stupid apes with oversized brains who think too much of themselves. But other apes are orders of magnitude stupider than we are, so... So watch out.

It isn&#39;t!  Reality is completely different. Microbes and plants together fix nitrogen in a symbiosis. Fertilizer increases the amount of nitrogen in the soil. However it kills Microbes. As a result plants can not absorb as many minerals as they should. The nitrogen  makes plants grow faster. However the more you use, the more you need to compensate for the loss of microbes. A result of this is that our soils are void of minerals or rather, the plants can&#39;t absorb them at their rate of growth. Without fertilizer and without monocultures, your soil would never really deplete. Monocultures matter because some plants fix more nitrogen than they use and others use more than they fix. A mix keeps it in balance. Minerals slowly get depleted however in nature you simply poop them back into the system. Any minor amounts lost to rivers etc would get replenished by dust from for example deserts! The planet is amazing and even deserts have a vital purpose. Would be great if you could fix the video because it is a massive issue that our food has lost very significant amounts of nutrients and thereby leads to a calorie dense diet, we need to eat more food to compensate for the loss of nutrition.

It doesn&#39;t alter how one might judge him after evaluating his actions, but puts that judgement in its proper place. It&#39;s personal to him, not of universal scope. And yet his work for the good and for ill both had an important impact. That&#39;s how history worked out. Subtracting him from it is counterfactual. In fact, there he was; that&#39;s what he did. So the (probable - if counterfactual) irrelevance of his self to this all taking place at some unknowable future time, after he actually did what he actually did does count for something - as the cautionary statement you end with. Your own research might be irrelevant to its future causal chain of consequences (because &quot;it was going to happen anyway&quot; - perhaps) ... er, sorry, that has distracted me ... <i>but perhaps not</i> - that&#39;s how counterfactual non-events go. The thing is it can help us be aware of standing somewhere in some causal chain. What we do now might have effects (if what follows follows from what we did, it is a fact that &quot;we&quot; ... one-of-us ... changes the world at that point. In  a sense it&#39;s irrelevant, too, that the actual agent of change acted within some or other context. Every context has many possible outcomes. ...<br><br>Sorry, I&#39;m floundering here, but let me struggle on, and hope someone can make head or tail of this. Think of something like the walking frame elderly people use to support themselves all over the world today as an example of the importance of what actually happens (and thence the &quot;irrelevance&quot; - maybe diminished relevance? of the context - enabling all those things that might Possibly happen). It&#39;s this: Someone sees the old folk struggling to walk with walking sticks (maybe), and improves the walking stick to give it a broad base of support. &quot;Problem solved&quot;. And then I would guess that has determined the future of such mobility aids for maybe 30 years? The problem is &quot;solved&quot;, so there&#39;s no point in seeking improvements. <br><br>Why solve a &quot;solved&quot; problem? Well that&#39;s why I chose the walking frame as an example of how we stop thinking as soon as a problem is &quot;solved&quot; (thus becoming at least temporarily relevant to how the future progresses). Consider the walking frame for maybe a month or so (in your spare time, not as the main focus of your life). I think you&#39;ll find the solution has some imperfections. People learn to live with these, but they also mean that the problem isn&#39;t really &quot;solved&quot;. One of the set of solutions has been found, and those who take care of the mobility of the elderly have settled for that is &quot;good enough&quot;. (And no elderly person has tried to come up with something better - maybe because that&#39;s an unusual trait in the elderly, more than it being an acceptance of the frame as &quot;The Solution&quot;.<br><br>It is possible that industrial ammonia production would&#39;ve taken decades to be discovered, were it not for Fritz Haber. This still makes him &quot;irrelevant&quot; (I still agree with how you state it - in that this is the essence of it all, even if it doesn&#39;t cover ever aspect ...)<br><br>Hmm ... and after all that, I think probably what I&#39;ve pointed out doesn&#39;t matter. :-) Oh well ... Good.<br><br>We&#39;re all part of processes that almost drive themselves, but our input at least puts some &quot;rudder on the ship&quot; if it&#39;s something important like fertilizer that results (instead of long strings of words that walk a verbal circle like above). I think the solution would lie in the way we learn to manage our Values. Whatever we do is driven by what we value. If we value junk, we&#39;ll bring junk into being. If we value just short-term things, we&#39;ll be short sighted. If we have a deeper set of values that we put effort into actively maintaining, maybe we&#39;ll one day catch ourselves (this process we&#39;re in might be driven by summed values - or &quot;evaluations&quot;) before we fall the next time? We can&#39;t foretell the future, but we can be careful of what we respect and disrespect, for instance.<br><br>We have this monkey impulse to respect the monkey who&#39;s the best at fighting, biting, destroying, for instance. It&#39;s probably a good idea to be a bit more human (&quot;human&quot; being an ideal here - something we can become, rather than something we complacently imagine we already are) about respect for bigger monkeys with meaner temperaments. To be more human, it might even be necessary to learn the art of deliberately Disrespecting that which shouldn&#39;t be respected? We should definitely not treat our respect as cheap currency to just throw away on junk people. <br><br>I had a reasonably comprehensive set of personal thoughts about this Values issue when I was younger, but a lot of them seem to have leaked out of my head.

To this layman&#39;s mind, it seems like a not-so-subtle way of culling humans off of earth. Forced population reduction squared. Natural diseases, fatalities as a result of every day life, and the weather do not seem to take enough of a toll on us in the eyes of some very wealthy and overly influential individuals who refer to themselves, openly, as the elites.

What is moral to one person may seem immoral to another.   Fritz Haber acted on what he felt was moral, his love of country and people (The people part further reinforced by his resigning in solidarity with his fellows), and wanted to end the war quickly rather than having a long protracted war that young men get thrown into like a meat grinder.    The same reasoning as to why some including myself would say that the nuclear bombs dropped on Japan were moral and justified, without which Japan never would have surrendered and the war could have gone on years longer, maybe over a decade, with many countless additional lives lost both in war itself and to suicide as people throw themselves off cliffs rather than surrender.    Granted,  Haber wasn&#39;t against Japan and Japan&#39;s culture was especially resistant to surrender.      But it&#39;s still none the less the comfort of modern retroflection that can too easily condemn the actions of a man in the past living under a different moral framework, and experiencing immediate present dangers and decisions.  <br><br>And no, not just anyone can invent something.   There may be countless civilization defining technologies that have been skipped or lost because of failed opportunity,  and in many cases it may take years to decades before even a needed invention might come to fruition.
