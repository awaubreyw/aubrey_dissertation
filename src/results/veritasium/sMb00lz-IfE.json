Rolling a die seems random, but only because we aren&#39;t capable of measuring everything about the die accurately enough to predict the result if it goes through enough tumbles - no quantum mechanics required.<br><br>Second, we typically explain the 2nd law by pointing out that for a somewhat ordered system, it can move to any of many possible states that are more disordered that the starting point, but relatively few that are more ordered, so that simple probability takes us toward disorder. However, as Sean Carroll has pointed out, that may be simply because we live in a relatively ordered universe, compared to what it could be (what folks call the &quot;heat death&quot; of the universe of maximum entropy).

This allows for more entropy but no more information is required to describe its state (the only information required would be the state of the universe prior to the big bang and the number of time units you want to have passed).

It would seem that there is not much to say about &quot;randomness&quot;,  but it is actually a deep subject that you could write books about.<br><br>From high school science classes, I had concluded that you could theoretically determine the entire future with enough data, until I later learned that this was a philosophy that had a name, of &quot;determinism&quot;. After learning more about quantum physics, I realized that the philosophy was wrong.<br><br>By the time that you have 12 &quot;fundamental&quot; particles, part of what that tells you is that whatever these things are, they are not &quot;fundamental&quot;.  What Einstein was saying in so-many words about reducing our understanding of reality to the minimum of &quot;fundamentals&quot; would seem to have left unsaid  that the most satisfying reduction would be to unity.  Maybe that unity would be in string theory, or in Higgs field, but it seems to defy reason that &quot;unity&quot; could ever split into a dozen.<br><br>The early attempt at identifying &quot;fundamentals&quot; as earth, wind, fire and water was both insightful and half-baked silliness at the same time. Atoms got us a hit closer as &quot;fundamental&quot;, but then it started breaking down to protons, electrons, and neutrons, which then started breaking down into quarks.  Perhaps our search for fundamentals only discovers the limits of our ability to observe things.  <br><br>I remember a guy in my college dorm, a half-century ago, remarking that it was a bias, not necessarily so, that underlying reality had to be simple.  It would probably blow his mind that a casual comment like that stuck in my mind for 50 years.  I see his point, but still feel in deep gut that the &quot;bias&quot; is righteous.<br><br>If I were trying to stare at reality naively, like the ancient Greeks, with little to go on, I might have supposed that there were two fundamental forces in conflict: a force of order, as in perfect circles and triangles, and a force of disorder, causing any real-world representation of a circle or triangle to be imperfect.<br><br>My best guess of universal origin is the existence of the  &quot;uncaused event&quot;.  This would not be &quot;randomness&quot; in the sense of a coin toss, where outcome is really determined by subtle factors on which we do not have enough data, but an event that literally has no cause.<br><br>Infinite randomness, like monkeys banging randomly on typewriters, does not just reproduce the works of Shakespeare.

How can I know if that is not what is happening with the Universe, like it&#39;s getting more caotic but it resembles in a unkwown pattern? If that patttern exists it would also mean that the entropy of the Universe is constant just how it is with the changing string. <br><br>In other words, I need help to understand why entropy increases with time, a liquid don&#39;t stiring it self back to normal does not mean that entropy has changed. Let&#39;s say we have 3 particles paralel to it other with same velocity, and they are going in the direction of a uneven surface, when they collide to the surface, the particles would be totally disordered, each one going in a direction.<br>In this system, even thought it seens more random in the end, actually things could be predictable from the begining if you know about the surface, and initial velocity/position of the projectiles, which means entropy does not change with time in this case. And the fact that a liquid don&#39;t go back to its initial state, could just be because the pattern it has does not allow that.<br>If you can predict, than entropy is constant.<br><br>So please, tell me, why is entropy increasing, why it is not just a pattern progressing with constant entropy and the system changing in a caothic way? How did they prove that the Universe is not caothic but random.<br><br> aka: in the Universe, the information is being created following a super complex and caothic pattern (In this case since the pattern just not get more or less specific over time, entropy is constant) or, in the Universe, information is being created NOT following any pattern, just like the number pi, in this case entropy would change over time; since, every second, the pattern changes to a more specific one.<br><br>Is my concept of entropy even right? I don&#39;t see entropy as a measure of disorder, but as a inverse measure of how much patterns fit in the sample. Let&#39;s say we have the string 1010 again, but every second there is the addition of a new number choosen randomly, in this case 1010 would have a certain entropy, 1 sec later -&gt; 10100, then the original pattern has become more specific, there are less pattern that could fit a 1010 turning into a 10100 in one second. In this case entropy is higher because there are less patterns to fit a 1010 changing after 1 second to a 10100 then the are to fit a 1010 existing for 1 second. <br><br>In the first case, both the patterns of A-&quot;Start with 1010 for 1 sec, and then add a 1&quot; and B- &quot;Start with 1010 for 1 sec, and then add a 0&quot; and C-&quot;Start with 1010 for Y&gt;1 sec, and then do blablabla, and then....&quot;<br><br>but for the second one, A would be invalidated, and C (the general rule) would change to D-&quot;Start with 1010 for 1 sec, and then add a 0, and then do blablabla, and then...&quot; which has less possibilities than the C.<br><br>So the Universe could be analog as this situation where any new random incident results in the increase of entropy (Every time a number is added, the entropy goes up so it never goes down)<br>or<br>The Universe could be just very, very, very, very entropic, with a pattern that is still developing, it is not that information is being created, but it is changing in a way we can still not predict.<br><br>Or<br>Is the number being added into the string trully random, like pi<br>or<br>Is the number being added into the string just following a very very specific pattern", "comment_date": "2022-07-30T19:58:02Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Anshika Gupta", "comment_text": "seriously how did none of the comments notice the CAT at <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMb00lz-IfE&amp;t=4m00s\">4:00</a>", "comment_date": "2022-07-30T18:48:44Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Anshika Gupta", "comment_text": "the cat LMAOO", "comment_date": "2022-07-30T18:47:56Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Tal R.", "comment_text": "What if quantum mechanics are only pseudo random...?

According to modern quantum statistical mechanics, it is only the entropy of subsystems that increases over time (on average, in generic systems), and the principal mechanism behind this increase is entanglement generation through coherent evolution, not measurement-induced collapse of quantum-mechanical wave functions.

Let&#39;s analyze that bit compression example. So let&#39;s say we have an image and we compress it to the point that the result seems random. But that result really is not random because it is predictable. If the core of information is this compressed result, and the result is random then that means the arrangement of the pixels was random to begin with, or the scene before the picture was taken was random. How the scene was put together could be random or not, the fact that the compressed information seems random (or rather has no pattern) doesn&#39;t really prove anything in my opinion.<br><br>Also, entropy is describes dissorder but I don&#39;t think that it generates information or randomness at all. On the contrary, I think that disorder could be seemingly random but that&#39;s just because most decaying systems are chaotic and thus impossible to be predicted in any reasonable time by anyone. The double pendulum that is shown at the end is such a system, chaotic that is, not because there are not theories and equations as to how it will move, or that anyone of them is based on probability, but because the math gets really complicated really quick and the initial conditions turn out to be a big part of it&#39;s movement (as the video stated).<br><br>Finally, I believe there is a theory that states information cannot be generated or lost (no-hiding theorem). That adds to the point that information and randomness are not one and the same. So even if entropy increases as the second law of thermodynamics states, that still doesn&#39;t mean Laplace&#39;s Demon couldn&#39;t exist. <br><br>Anyway, I choose to believe that we live in a deterministic world, not claiming that this is right, just my belief.

The resolution of the contradiction is to note that there is more than one way to travel faster than light. The Schroedinger equation describes an oscillation in the way that exchanges timelike and spacelike intervals. In the way that exchanges energy and momentum we can have tachyonic Brownian motion which is of course strictly orthogonal to the wavelike behaviour. TBM goes into action when the Schroedinger equation interacts with Maxwell&#39;s equation, and this is the origin of entropy increase. It is also the mechanism by which we go from the deterministic Schroedinger equation to the situation where that cat is either strictly dead or strictly alive.<br><br>I open to other ideas on how to use a RNG in computer simulation.

I think the biggest part of the free will debate is about whether people have agency for their actions. Pragmatically we have to say people have free will otherwise it goes down a disempowering rabbit hole. Physically we understand that people&#39;s actions are strongly influenced by past environmental factors completely outside their control, so in society we try to shore up some of that disorder by creating safety nets against said circumstance.

For particles at a anatomic level follows patterns, which may be related to the &quot;unseen observer&quot;, we don&#39;t know how, but that does not mean that it is random.

My belief is that Laplace was implying some sort of constant continuous knowledge of the states of all the particles based on the calculations from some point in time. meaning that every future calculation would be made from the prior calculation. Laplace seemed to assume that ultimate knowledge of the universe&#39;s individual particles would negate Chaos. (Maybe he is right?) Similar to how we can predict eclipses. Correct me if I&#39;m wrong but I think when you&#39;re calculating the micro universe you&#39;re looking at individual particles and you&#39;re dealing with a very small period of time. Compare that to the macro universe, which is much more massive and contains much more entanglement. The amount of change on average is very little in the same small period of time we used to measure the micro universe. I am under the impression that Laplace knew about this and realized that he didn&#39;t need to worry about the macro universe and what it was doing.

All particles of mass interact with gravity over an infinitely long distance and ones without mass as least have the potential to interact by some kind of force, meaning that the universe is connected completely whereas a bunch of pixels on a screen are not and are decided by a machine. The universe depends on the interactions of particles completely for anything to happen. When entropy increases there are less patterns leading to more information that cannot be compressed however if you were to break it down into the individual particles there are still the same amount of particles interacting and there are analog differences in for example position that cannot be compressed. For example say there is a big patch of red and blue paint when these paints mix entropy increases as purple is made but no new paint is added and the individual amount of for example paint units stays the same but the 3 larger clumps of paint ordered into red,blue and purple can be arranged to form more colours than before. If we were to look at it as a cluster of two types of particles that can be arranged in a large number of ways in the first place instead on the macroscopic level then the amount of ways that each fundamental particle could arrange would be constant. The increase in information can be attributed not to more particles being added but to less clumping of the particles into similar groups or patterns, there are still the same amount of particles if you were to look at them as individual particles rather than clumps, each interacting just like they would if they were in a more disordered state.

Meaning can only be grounded in the mind (not in the symbols, except for numerals, operators, which are computable). All that is contextual. And context only exists as a mental state, in a cognizer&#39;s mind...<br><br>Without cognizers, there is no information, because there is no uncertainty... In fact, the only way for data to BE informative, is if it reduces uncertainty. This implies that a student who correctly answers a question from a teacher is not informing the teacher, who already knew the answer. It&#39;s a mistake to confuse information with mere data. Not all data is informative and information depends on the state of uncertainty of the cognizer. Without cognition, there is no such thing as information. Only meaningless data, with no potential to inform (since that potential depends on the existence of a form of cognition, which might depend on the existence of something capable of being conscious. Remove that and information stops existing... along with meaning...", "comment_date": "2021-02-17T02:56:20Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Carlos Cabrera Hern\u00e1ndez", "comment_text": "I believe entropy of the universe is constant.

For example, there was this video I clicked this morning titled &quot;You sir, are a fish&quot;. Hours later, I was looking for something to eat and without even thinking about fish, decided to cook two tilapia and two small salmon slabs. Then, I thought about that video. This has happened before. I watched a video titled &quot;riddle of the rocks&quot;. It was one of those super weird, bizarre meme videos. In that video, someone was trying to solve the riddle of the rocks. The answer made no sense. The answer was &quot;lemon&quot;... Anyway, days after I watched that video, I went hiking with my parents and when we reached a waterfall, me and my parents sat down for a while. I noticed these people balancing small rocks on top of each other. There were two small towers of rocks. I was bored so I built my own tower. It was kind of big. When I was done, my mom asked me if I wanted one of her flavored water packets that you put into water and I chose lemon flavor, literally a few seconds later, I remembered that video and was like &quot;hmm&quot; All this happens every now and then. I&#39;m not talking about easy predictions, like an eclipse. People have told me I&#39;m tripping but I showed some people prof that I&#39;m not making this up and they acknowledged that they saw the same thing I saw but never really tripped out on it like I do.

I have some thoughts that I haven&#39;t been able to disprove yet... <br><br>Given that <br><br>A) Space itself is expanding (dark energy) <br><br>B) That entropy is forever increasing, and <br><br>C) That anything beyond the observable universe effectively does not exist for us, effectively becoming lost information... <br><br>I wonder if there is a symmetry between universal entropy (which is always increasing) and universal availability? (which is always decreasing)<br><br>In other words, if we were to assume a universe that has a constant amount of total information available, but that the amount of information per particle was increasing, and the &quot;dark energy&quot; that we&#39;ve been looking for is really the Universe&#39;s way of balancing the scale?  What if there is, in fact, a constant amount of total information accessible to our observable Universe?  <br><br>I&#39;m a software engineer, and one of the hardest parts of my job is getting a big job done within the limits of what a (fast!) modern processor can do. As you no doubt know, without careful thought and design, it&#39;s quite easy to write code that will instantly overwhelm a processor with tasks that might take a billion years to complete. Literally can be done with a single line of code that might take longer than projected heat death to accomplish. If you&#39;re curious, take a look at the &quot;traveling salesman&quot; problem - a good interview question for a hopeful programmer hire.  <br><br>So, much of my job consists of deciding what is &quot;good enough&quot; and <b>not</b> computing everything to the &quot;best&quot; answer.<br><br> Recently there&#39;s been a bevy of people talking about living in a simulation. The increasingly impressive results of highly immersive, graphics-rich video games make it seem more and more possible that we do, in fact, live in such a simulation.

I actually just wanted to comment &quot;Veritasium with Vsauce music is pretty nice actually&quot; or something like that, but now my point is proven and slightly disproven, because I still think that music might have a decent impact on the immersion and enjoyability of whatever youre watching or experiencing. But I havent had enough experience to confirm that in my head. At this point I dont think its as deep a difference maker as I once hypothesized it to be (I say hypothesized because I was never sure but had theories ig, i don&#39;t fully remember maybe I did believe it had a big impact on enjoyability) but I still think it makes a difference at this point in my theorizing and experiences Ig i could call it, idk what else to call what Ive been doing, its not experimenting but its more like testing when I get the chance, or studying more like it whenever I think about it while an opportunity is there to see its effect. But it also depends on what Im watching that Im testing/studying it with, ig im not fully sure on that one. Like anime music moments compared to this could be different but idk for sure. More studying and me possibly researching the subject cuz I might do that but i dont think there&#39;s a high chance I will and saying that prob just increased the chances cuz now im just thinking of what I could find but ill prob just stick to the way ive been doing it which is just studying with things that I watch naturally when I have a chance.", "comment_date": "2020-10-13T23:13:35Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "RED Pipor\u00e8", "comment_text": "The cat is the most random thing ever \ud83e\udd23", "comment_date": "2020-10-13T17:31:20Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Einezweioctopi", "comment_text": "Boy, they really got into Vsauce character.", "comment_date": "2020-10-13T16:41:34Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Moshe Jacobs", "comment_text": "The most important thing I learned from this video, is you don&#39;t have to peel kiwi fruit (<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMb00lz-IfE&amp;t=9m22s\">9:22</a>)", "comment_date": "2020-10-13T15:52:30Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Pedro Vieira", "comment_text": "<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMb00lz-IfE&amp;t=8m26s\">8:26</a> but how can we have free will if fundamentally all those interactions are random?", "comment_date": "2020-10-13T15:10:00Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Vivic", "comment_text": "Top crossovers of human history", "comment_date": "2020-10-13T13:33:04Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "wanjohi mugo", "comment_text": "was that cat random ...", "comment_date": "2020-10-13T12:05:32Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "StonesAndSand", "comment_text": "I randomly found this video...", "comment_date": "2020-10-13T04:29:37Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Aiden Burnett", "comment_text": "This is better than endgame ngl", "comment_date": "2020-10-13T00:42:12Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "uzijn", "comment_text": "Derek: And a random string of letters does not generally make a word<br>Welsh: Ydw i&#39;n j\u00f4c i chi?", "comment_date": "2020-10-12T20:13:23Z", "likes_count": 531}, {"comment_by": "jet", "comment_text": "It\u2019s odd hearing the Vsauce tracks playing in the background into a conclusion without hearing \u201cand as always, thanks for watching.\u201d", "comment_date": "2020-10-12T19:43:53Z", "likes_count": 2}, {"comment_by": "Matteo Tivan", "comment_text": "When in a movie they can&#39;t explain how weird things happen: <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMb00lz-IfE&amp;t=6m44s\">6:44</a>", "comment_date": "2020-10-12T17:47:37Z", "likes_count": 23}, {"comment_by": "Matteo Tivan", "comment_text": "It is impressive how Michael Stevens always appears out of nowhere, even if he&#39;s in a Veritasium video", "comment_date": "2020-10-12T17:43:36Z", "likes_count": 3433}, {"comment_by": "Ian Gregg", "comment_text": "This guy is so freaking cool!", "comment_date": "2020-10-12T15:09:24Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "pika chu", "comment_text": "The thumbnail tho<br>\ud83d\ude33\ud83d\ude33\ud83d\ude33", "comment_date": "2020-10-12T13:42:35Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Ken", "comment_text": "Pretty sure we don&#39;t have free will.

I&#39;m assuming you mean the latter.<br><br>&quot;Randomness is disorder.&quot;  Who&#39;s to say? What if randomness carries an order, but It&#39;s just too difficult to find it?<br><br>You somehow drive this train of thought to conclude information = entropy.

A set of only zeros has as much information as a random set of zeros and ones. This is because unless you tell me what number comes after each zero on the first example, I have no way of knowing, and therefore each zero is information. Now of course you can compress this into just, zero. But you were only able to compress this when you were informed of the contents of that file. You had to use each bit of information on that file, before you created a new file, that was less repetitive.

Rising entropy does not mean the universe is not deterministic. It just means It&#39;s much harder to predict it. It&#39;s still deterministic, and therefore still hypothetically predictable, along with all of human behavior, past present and future. So I still agree with Mr. Laplace. <br><br>However, a deterministic universe does not necessarily mean an absence of free will. You act according to your will.

It is wrong to say that something is random or not random. One could say that something is more or less random. In the same way it is relative and even subjective to say that there is a pattern.

Actually true randomness does follow a more likely pattern regarding it&#39;s distribution type.

This more likely pattern in the distribution outcome may occur if one could replicate true randomness. But since that would be almost impossible, the distribution types tend to present themselves more convergent because we can&#39;t assure that all the possible outcomes have exactly the same probability of happening.

Does those factors could lead to the universe being a living thing since it respond to an evolutive logic? And if so, what IS the source of the entropy and in what way is it efficient to make it go up? A possibility I&#39;ve came to would be that ideas themselves are the true livings, and that anything we consider &quot;living&quot; are simply able to somewhat show their connectivity and interdependance with ideas to use the same mechanics themselves (evolution). <br><br>In this possibility, there would be a number of &quot;primal informations&quot;, like dots in a 1D universe, and once you rely some of those points, some of the information is crystalized in the form of a link, providing length, a second dimension that permit energy to be transfered at any point among the line with different distributions than their previously absolute amount, laying in the creation of structures, like emotions or feelings. Then if you progress further, possibilities are finite, and cost more and more just to stay stable, up to a point when they could do it no more without breaking, and exhausting all pairs with time. How could they evolve, or live, further? Well, why not take those lines, and close them up themselves, with what we know as depths, a third dimension wich can futher enhance possibilities by adding a filter that can be replaced without causing it to collapse into enterely separate individuals. Therefore, that filter could be more than that, it could be used as a way to change the entropy and energetic charge of any given structure, with any other one, without any collapsing, for a minimalistic energy cost, changing the total value with little to no change to the overall structure, wich we could call &quot;communication&quot;. Therafter, possibilities become numb, but still, any power of a finite number, will always remain a finite number, and each dimension has it&#39;s limits. That event occured many times up to our dimension... wich one is it, the third, the fourth, the fifth.... I&#39;m not sure but I,d bet on fourth. Anyways, just like you said, it would mean that knowing exactly at wich state we are currently, and what is the exact starting state, we could find the euqation of both life, and the universe, and thereforth, predict all possible futures. (My guess is our universe would weight about X((((((((power  X)power X)((power  X)power X)((((power  X)power X)((power  X)power X) informations, with X being the Primal informations.)<br><br>And we&#39;re currently develloping core technologie for that, even if it doesn&#39;t look good for now. We have to figure out ways to make decent Quantic computers, probably alot more powerfull that the current state achievable, but it would be theoriticaly plausible to predict the future. However, I,m not so confident, BECAUSE of the same laws that govern it plausibility. Good to know how quantic work, but there&#39;s another conclusion to ANY experience done. Any result is the most universally desirable one, thereforth, once it&#39;s done, it may never repeat, until it&#39;s possibility fits the same criteria again more than others amongst its pool. On small scale experiment, no problem, we can run as many as we want until it happen again... but for predicting the whole world future, let me break your illusion right there : We would need tu first have a Quantic computer strong enough to simulate, at minimum, our universe, or isolated parts of it based on derivated methods, hardly achievable since it need the correct formula to our universe. Second we&#39;d need to be able so simulate it without simulating it or capturing any result, it&#39;s like catching a blackhole without having it interact with anything, good luck. Third, even if successfull, the results in themselves are a change big enough to invalidate everything, and including them in the simulation is the only way the have a realistic prediction. And lastly, and somewhat linked to number two and three, if any failure in those would apply, the prediction would therefore always be of a future that will no longer apply, needing us to run an exact amount of replica of the process to get back to it being the higher state of possibilities. And even if everything would happen to worked perfectly, it could still be invalidated by the fact the result made it plausible in a simpler way that waking into existence, after all, livings are a way more efficient and ecconomic vehicle for reality and possibilities that lie within it.", "comment_date": "2020-04-27T06:55:52Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Kedar K", "comment_text": "What the heck is \u201chi pa!\u201d!?", "comment_date": "2020-04-27T02:03:25Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Riligil", "comment_text": "Imagine for a second that another being measures a particle that is entangled with a particle here. now imagine if they did have the technology to completely predict it\ud83e\uddd0", "comment_date": "2020-04-27T00:05:41Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "wolfboyft", "comment_text": "I thought that entropy was a measurement of how many ways you could rearrange a system for it to stay the same, such as in a homogenous glass of cold milk and coffee choosing two cubic mL at random and swapping them changes nothing but in a hot glass with two distinct layers it does change the system a lot more often (ie swapping a part of milk and a part of coffee), so I thought that the universe&#39;s end was going to be a cold, flat soup of energy, not a place with pure information and chaos.

For example pumping blood is independent of our will, we can&#39;t directly affect it with our will, because our brain always pumps blood based on other things it measures like our body temperature and never changes our blood pressure based on our will. So even when someone is in coma his blood will keep pumping because it was independent of our will in the first place.<br><br>Sure we can affect our blood pressure indirectly by using our will to exercise, but that isn&#39;t the same thing.<br><br>When a baby is born and starts learning how to move the body the will is just doing random things and once the brain reacts to the will by moving a body part the will recognizes that by doing that random thing the brain will always move that body part.<br><br>Since no human brain is exactly the same some people have more control over their body than others.<br><br>If your brain happens to move some muscles inside your body in a specific way based on the input it gets from your will to make a specific sound someone else&#39;s brain might not care about the input from the will when deciding whether to move that muscle or not.<br><br>With this in mind, swapping peoples consciousness might be possible at some point.<br>Since the brain and the will are probably seperatable from each other we might be able to insert someone&#39;s will into someone else&#39;s brain.<br>The parts of the brain that manage important body functions would work the same since the brain didn&#39;t change, but the random input from the will would be different.<br><br>Also, when you&#39;re sleeping it&#39;s not your brain that is actually sleeping but your will since you are making less conscious thoughts while sleeping and your brain is just autopiloting through your memory and imagining situations by mixing memories together without caring about the random input from your will. <br>Lucid dreaming is just your will waking up and interrupting whatever your brain is doing but without interrupting it too much because that would result in your brain stopping the memory mixing and starting to move your body parts again based on the will instead of using your will&#39;s input for memory mixing.<br><br>In other words, your brain is a closed computer program that doesn&#39;t let anyone access the code and always does specific processes in the background and relies on user input for other processes.<br><br>Being awake is like playing a video game. You can control the main character with your input but your possibilities are very limited. You can&#39;t tell the game to make your character vomit. The game just wont doesn&#39;t care about your input when deciding whether your character should vomit. You can tell the character to eat something spicy which might in turn lead to the character vomiting but it&#39;s all limited by what the game wants to allow you to control and what not. <br>Sleeping is like watching a video in full screen. Most people just let the video pass by and if they suddenly start giving the computer input, for example by pressing some buttons on the keyboard, the video might leave full screen or just stop playing altogether which would make you wake up. Lucid dreaming is when you give input to the computer without interrupting the video. If you click space bar the video will pause. This is what most people would press first. But if you&#39;re a lucid dreamer you know what buttons to press to influence what you can see (or imagine) without closing or pausing the video (waking up). <br><br>Swapping consciousnesses of two people would be like two users changing computers. Your friends computer will probably react to your input very similarly as your computer. Most computers will exit full screen if the user presses ESC. Some computers might be programmed to exit full screen when the user presses space though. Not only may computers and brains be programmed to handle some input differently, but some computers might even allow you to do some things that your computer doesn&#39;t. Like SYNCHRONIZING RGB EFFECTS. Going back to your own computer you can input the exact same as you did on your friends computer, your computer just wont synchronize RGB effects because it doesn&#39;t care about your input for that process or just isn&#39;t even capable of doing that. <br><br>Also giving birth would be like using two computers&#39; parts to build a new computer and cloning would be like picking a specific build and deciding to build an exact copy of it.

That\u2019s exactly correct! But let me help you take that a step further Derek. After all, you are responsible for my latest theory/hypothesis. The Quasi-Theory goes as follows: When something occurs like quantum entanglement, environmental decoherence, or a quantum measurement, the state of the thing which underwent the interaction changes permanently in a way that is irreversible. Can you guess what the state of that thing was? Superposition. In isolation, all particles in the universe (fundamental or otherwise) exist in a state of superposition. Once a quantum event of any kind occurs, the information in the universe increases which means entropy increases. This change of state from superposition to certain is irreversible which is why you can not decrease the net entropy of the universe. That is why entropy increases with time. Now as for time itself, I thought I had an explanation for its cause but I\u2019ve begun to seriously doubt its validity.", "comment_date": "2020-03-22T18:28:27Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Shioafern huang", "comment_text": "How great is our God!", "comment_date": "2020-03-22T05:24:59Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Steen Eugen Poulsen", "comment_text": "<b>throws a quantum event at the demon and watches it die</b>", "comment_date": "2020-03-22T04:17:54Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Balu Andhavarapu", "comment_text": "I like to beleive what Einstein beleived", "comment_date": "2020-03-20T12:01:51Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Kv Vortex", "comment_text": "<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMb00lz-IfE&amp;t=01m00s\">01:00</a> Derek - &quot;What will happen tomorrow is not random&quot; - video uploaded 16th Jul 2014<br><br><br>17th Jul 2014 - Malaysia Airlines Flight 17 crashed...", "comment_date": "2020-03-20T07:46:13Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "William Cheese", "comment_text": "What isn&#39;t random is funny", "comment_date": "2020-03-20T04:10:50Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "yerko silva cruz", "comment_text": "EPR paradox?", "comment_date": "2020-03-19T22:29:44Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Jose Wilbert Rabino", "comment_text": "I ship the both of you", "comment_date": "2020-03-19T13:14:56Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "SuperVegitoFAN", "comment_text": "<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMb00lz-IfE&amp;t=2m35s\">2:35</a> i get that glitch in VL C from time to time.

Then a List consisting of only 0s tells us just as much as a completely random and unpredictable result, the amount of information is the same, even if you can compress it. Order only reduces Information if it is not a result of the information. For example if we only have 3 particles that we measure and then arbitrarily say that when we send this information we just infinitely repeat those three datapoints, then the ability to compress the data actually means that there is less data, because there is no additional meaning.<br>So information is meaning which is also why we value this Word &#39;information&#39; at all. <br><br>Defining Information as randomness robs it of its value, why would anyone care about randomness its absolutely not important, except maybe for a free will debate where randomness actually comes from. (I know you didnt just define it as randomness, but its what you ended up with, and even if the intuitional meaning of &#39;Information&#39; would be randomness then that word would also be useless) <br><br><br><br>Second of all, Enthropy is not randomness, its disorder. <br><br>Even if we accept your definition of Information they are not the same.<br>This becomes very clear when we know that the second law of thermodynamics would still be a thing even if quantum mechanics didnt exist, in other words: even in a Universe with no randomness in it whatsoever (Also known as a deterministic universe) Entrophie would still increase. Quantum mechanics has nothing to do with this. <br><br><br><br>Thirdly: There is still no free will. If your actions are based on truly random events that you have absolutely no control over than you still have no free will. I frankly couldnt even think of what kinds of physics would be needed to actually allow free will. <br><br><br><br>Arguing that if everything else is theoretically computable, that only information from those truly random quantum events is the only new information in our world i could agree with, it depends wether or not one would convey new meaning as information only if the person that recives the information doesnt know about it even if he could know it in theory.<br><br><br>In conclusion my critique of this video would be that it seems to me that you used some wrong definitions that lead to a wrong conclusion.<br>If i missunderstood or you disagree im open for corrections and debatte, please correct me if i am mistaken.", "comment_date": "2020-02-03T22:41:28Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "High Guardian", "comment_text": "Wait if Michael is offering us to go watch this video and Veritassium is offering us to watch Michael\u2019s vid again.....that means we\u2019re stuck in a paradox.... <br><br><br><br><br>Or are we?<br><b>Vsauce music intensifies</b>", "comment_date": "2020-02-03T20:52:05Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Anastasi", "comment_text": "Nothing is random in a universe that obeys laws.", "comment_date": "2020-02-03T20:46:21Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "thigh gaming Alexo", "comment_text": "LaPlace Demon is a very interesting topic", "comment_date": "2020-02-03T20:34:14Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Ariel Nehmadi", "comment_text": "what will happen to our universe if we had less particels?

The dev-code of the video game, is the deterministic aspect of the game, as designed by us. The chaotic element, is how we then play with and change it, as players and developers. In that sense, no matter if we know all that is within the &quot;verse&quot; of the video game in its current state, if we feel like makin&#39; something new, there&#39;s gonna be something new. So, if an &quot;universal intelligence&quot; knew everything within any particular version of the game, but not beyond it, it&#39;s &quot;omniscience&quot; would be limited to the game-world, and would be oblivious of both other iterations of the game, and us as the creators and players of the game.<br><br>Likewise with &quot;reality&quot; and spirit. I/We, as spirit and consciousness, create &quot;realities&quot; in which we then roleplay as the characters of our choosing.

That if you simply knew enough information you could accurately predict what it will do. Are whole weather system is based on chaos theory. We know where the jet streams are, where the mountains are, how hot it is, where the oceans are, how close we are to the sun. Every single condition we can see and test helps us understand what something will do with greater accuracy, Chaos theory does not say things are random, it says they only appear to be random because you don&#39;t have enough information, and assuming that things are random simply because you cannot observe everything ourselves to prove it is an argument from ignorance. You also mentioned how new information is being generated and this new information is why we cannot predict what will happen, which would make sense how could we predict something completely new? However, this goes against another law of thermodynamics, the first law. Matter and Energy cannot be created or destroyed in a isolated system, you can only change their form. Isn&#39;t it kind of a stretch to assume that new information is being generated simply because we cannot see where it is coming from?

Maybe it&#39;s the concept of free will itself that just doesn&#39;t make sense. Maybe the notion of free will is simply not a self consistent thing? I mean when I think of free will, I think of the notion that I am somehow a separate entity from the rest of the universe, self-contained and able to make decisions about things without interference from the outside world. So for a decision to be truly voluntary, a true example of free will being excercised, it would have to be completely unaffected by the outside world - but that is a paradox, because you can&#39;t make decisions about anything without receiving information, and thus interacting with the universe, so the whole concept just breaks down. Unless you allow for interference from the outside world, but then - are you truly free? or were your actions really determined (pun intended) by your surroundings, things outside of your control? It seems bizarre to think that we can have free will because it implies that there is an individual there to have it. But there isn&#39;t, because everything that makes us, &quot;us&quot; was determined by other (perhaps random) events that we had no control over, exactly because the transient thing that we think of as &quot;ourselves&quot; is perpetually being shaped by our surroundings, and has been for as long as we have existed, and will for as long as we exist. It&#39;s really trippy to think about these kinds of things. It seems like the inevitable concusion is that free will is an empty and meaningless concept, and that the notion of an individual identity, a self, is just as absurd, since the two are inextricably linked to one another - and then you just think &quot;great but wtf do I do with that?&quot; and you go on as if nothing has changed.", "comment_date": "2019-06-01T21:32:45Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "JohanniklasLp", "comment_text": "What if you were the only &#39;random&#39; person?

The reason the string &quot;0000000000&quot; has less entropy than &quot;1001010110&quot; is because you have less uncertainty in the former case as to what the next value of the sequence is. That also means &quot;0000000000000000000000000000000000&quot; is even lower entropy than &quot;0000000000&quot; since you have a stronger prior (and less uncertainty) in what the next value will be. But which of these two sequences is more informative? The former, since it gives you greater predictability for the next term in the sequence. So the relationship between information and entropy is not an equality. I think saying that white noise contains &quot;maximum information&quot; is not a meaningful thing. Neither is saying that a blank screen contains no information at all. In theoretical terms, you have it flipped.<br><br><br>In some sense, information in the way that you are talking about is a measure of bipartite entropy, in which partitioning a string into subsystems (e.g. &quot;001001100100&quot; into &quot;001001&quot; and &quot;100100&quot;)  allows them to be compared in a simpler way (in this case realizing that the two strings are related by a single operator that reverses them). This can also be a sort of &quot;course-grained&quot; entropy, in which predictability of the next part of a sequence is low, but predictability of the next 10 parts of a sequence is high (for instance, knowing that 6 of the next 10 are likely to be 0&#39;s, but having no information about their order).

Information entropy is negative thermodynamic entropy(as far as the equations are concerned). Meaning that information entropy is the opposite of randomness. Also, thermodynamic entropy characterises a state, one point in it&#39;s phase space, if you picture it as a graph. Shannon&#39;s entropy however characterises a source of information, not the information itself. So Shannon&#39;s entropy is a path or a curve, running through it&#39;s phase space.<br><br>The second law of thermodynamics isn&#39;t a law actually. It contradicts with Newton&#39;s second law. It&#39;s actually a mathematical approximation, meaning that isn&#39;t true everywhere. It has to do with how the law is modelled. It deals primarily with gases, where the molecules are modelled as spheres and not as what they actually are. Entropy isn&#39;t actually universally increasing, because gravity.

Imagine rolling a die or flipping a coin when deciding what to order on a menu from a restaurant. Perhaps the result is unpredictable, but can you really say that you used free will to make the choice? No. You are a slave to the probabilistic rules of quantum mechanics (just as in a deterministic universe you would be a slave to the rules of classical mechanics).

Compression is the reduction to a singularity but you&#39;re not increasing the randomness because that information needs to go elsewhere. You&#39;re just moving it. The replacement of strings condenses it into a pattern that&#39;s signified by a character or set of characters. And the resultant file undergoes another pass to recognize more patterns from the results of the previous pass. The patterns don&#39;t disappear. They are held in a key or somewhere else to signify the changes to the file. That information is still there although the size of the video or file would be smaller. You are right though that the value of the data in the keys would be greater and proportional to the data it represents. But that doesn&#39;t mean that the incompressible result is totally random.

Let&#39;s take John Conway&#39;s game of life. All of the information on the board can be stored as either a one - a filled space, or a zero - an unfilled space. If you have a row of ten filled spaces, that would be easy to store. You would only need the number of cells before the row, and have them all be zero, then the cells in the row, and have them all be one, and then go to the end of the frame and all of those unfilled spaces are zero. So let&#39;s say its x cells before and after the row, it would be: repeat 0 x times, repeat 1 ten times, repeat zero x times. Now, if you let the predictable laws of the game run, it will turn into 3 rows of eight in the next step instead of 1 row of ten. So now it looks like repeat 0 x times, repeat 1 eight times, repeat 0 y times, repeat 1 eight times, repeat 0 y times, repeat 1eight times, repeat 0 x times.

If we restrict ourselves to strictly classical physics, both laws can be valid and are not mutually exclusive. The second law has been around much longer than quantum mechanics, and the randomness that a classical chaotic system exhibits arises from a lack of information about every single particle in the system, not from the quantum mechanical randomness of the particle. For example, a dice roll is random because you don&#39;t know all of the forces acting on the die. If you knew all of the forces and velocities associated with the dice roll, it would be completely deterministic. Since classical randomness is due to the lack of information of a system and not due to some intrinsic property of matter which is the case for quantum mechanics, the Laplacian view that the world is deterministic still holds. A classically deterministic world and a world in which the second law holds can simultaneously exist without paradox, which is the opposite of what Derek was saying near the end of the video.<br><br>Keep in mind that I was just talking about classical physics. Of course, randomness in quantum mechanics is not the same. The randomness of a particle in quantum mechanics is an intrinsic property of the particle itself and does not arise from lack of information the same way that it does in classical mechanics. Quantum mechanics actually invalidates the Laplacian view because of the uncertainty principle, and thus opens up the possibility of non deterministic concepts like free will in terms of physical law, as what Derek was mentioning in the video, but this is was not my point. My point is that classically, the Laplacian view and the second law are not mutually exclusive.", "comment_date": "2018-07-15T03:11:57Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Paarth", "comment_text": "Can we control a electron ?", "comment_date": "2018-07-14T18:20:32Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Charulata Panigrahi", "comment_text": "I waited for Michael to say thanks for watching", "comment_date": "2018-07-14T06:57:17Z", "likes_count": 2}, {"comment_by": "Anabolic Catalyst", "comment_text": "Ugh, why must you eat delicious beautiful fruit in front of me?

The Poincare Recurrence Interval is the amount of time it takes for the finite states in the Universe to repeat. This is a truly gigantic time span, but it holds conceptually. It is the same concept that in a room of 366 or more people, you are guaranteed two people in that room will have the same birthday, excluding year.

The issue would still be there, therefore quantum mechanics can\u00b4t be the whole cause. Especially since you don\u00b4t even know if queantum mechanics are truly random or just impossible for us to predict. The difference is that only the former can create &quot;information&quot;.<br><br>In fact, the reason the current universe is harder to describe is because of the expansion of the universe. If it stopped expanding, everything would eventually fall into a black hole which should be far easier to describe. <br><br>Secondly, what do you mean by entropy? When you talked about how entropy is information, a room with maximum entropy would have completely random tempratures on every particle making it impossible to accurately state the temperature without listing all the particles and there temperatures. When you talk about how entropy increases over time, in this case that would mean that the random temperatures would merge over time and all of the room would eventually have the same temperature, which is almost no information, you can state the temperature with a single number.<br><br>You are using two different meanings of entropy that mean opposite things, therefore the conclusions become invalid. I even checked wikipedia and entropy is not chaos. It is the second alternative.<br><br>&quot;entropy is information&quot; <br>This depends on how you define information. Your reasoning only states that describing a chaos requires more information, the amount of unpredictability aka randomness being proportional to the amount of information required. <br><br>What I found with a google search was that &quot;information cannot be created or destroyed&quot; refers to the fact that on a quantum level, it is impossible to hide the past or create a fake past. In this case, information is simply knowledge, and this knowledge does not get destroyed or created because it gets harder or easier to describe.<br><br><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMb00lz-IfE&amp;t=8m07s\">8:07</a> This is what I mean. Entropy is not what you would call order or disorder. disorder is something random, but entropy is not random. If the entropy increases in a classical (in classical physics) closed system (which it still does), by knowing the previous state you can predict the next state and therefore no randomness or information is created.", "comment_date": "2018-04-24T18:28:24Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Jacqui Leather", "comment_text": "I love that you just continued when your cat jumped into the frame, embracing the randomness of the take! :D :D :D", "comment_date": "2018-04-24T12:23:55Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Sammie Schouten", "comment_text": "applejuice", "comment_date": "2018-04-23T23:08:43Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "joyela aeuvunya", "comment_text": "but but but but but<br><br>the key point. <br>what does &#39;random&#39; really mean?<br>How set is &#39;randomness&#39; for the scientific test?  how many differnt types of random could be tested?", "comment_date": "2018-04-23T10:03:55Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Domantas", "comment_text": "I still can not believe you bit in to AND ate the skin of the kiwi... that truly was the most unpredictable part of the video.", "comment_date": "2018-04-22T15:10:55Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Erza Scarlet", "comment_text": "<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMb00lz-IfE&amp;t=9m59s\">9:59</a> thats a man", "comment_date": "2018-04-21T08:59:12Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Matias Becerra", "comment_text": "Is Pi pure entropy?", "comment_date": "2018-04-20T22:59:26Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Jeffrey Lardizabal", "comment_text": "jfvpiqnewajlkjeZXKLJVoicsavs/aejwnvopi mds - somewhere, someone is going to attempt to make sense of the nonsense that I just typed, and likewise, someone else is going to argue that - the mere act of randomly typing such a string is not random, but predetermined by...", "comment_date": "2018-04-20T16:49:19Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "CrazyGhostie", "comment_text": "If you know the state of the universe at one time... meaning the position of all the particles...u also know the future of the entire universe... now lets say thats true...and so if u know the location of all the particles today...u also know the location of all those particles tomorrow...if u built a machine that can change the location of all of today&#39;s particles to tomorrow&#39;s particles...have u now built a time machine...have u now travelled to the future", "comment_date": "2018-04-20T10:53:19Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Yasir Irshad", "comment_text": "Daaaamn that hit the conscience real hard.

As particles interact, they can become entangled with each other, producing an entangled state that can only be completely described as a whole; the two particles have no independent description and can only be described together. Entangled particles have less entropy than pure particles because some of the information is shared, meaning you need fewer bits of information to describe the entire state of both particles than you would to describe each particle independently if they were not entangled.<br><br>So as particles interact thermodynamically, the system containing them tends to lose entanglement entropy and gain thermodynamic entropy.

While the number of microstates satisfying the macrostate of a system&#39;s present configuration increases, the number of bits of information required to describe the quantum properties of the particles involved decreases.

I really feel like scientists should be careful about using the word &quot;because&quot; - especially in this instance, since we are talking about a borderline philosophical question. I mean, ultimately, the only reason why we can postulate that what happens tomorrows is predictable is simply that we have observed yersterday, and the day before that, and the day before,... that all things that happen have some regularity to them, and we have ultimately boiled our observations down to some laws that explain what we observe (and sometimes things we have not observed yet). But there is nothing preventing the laws of nature to change tomorrow morning at 06 am, other than that this would violate all our previous observations. Saying stuff like the above quote is in my opinion an overly educated explanation - what you are basically saying is that in all the documented history of mankind we have observed a lot of phenomena to be predictable and following certain rules, matter being made up of this and that and so forth, and we therefore postulate that tomorrow all the same rules apply since they have always done that as far as we know. Don&#39;t fool yourself into thinking that the fundamental quantum theories we know are anything more than the systemization of our finest observations of Nature. The 4 fundamental forces in physics only &quot;bind&quot; future events insofar that we believe that these laws will also govern our world tomorrow. So, ultimately, I think it is wrong to say that events happen because of these laws. Conversely, we have discovered the laws because events happen as they have always been observed to do. To believe in Science is to believe that the regularities we observe will persist and have always existed. Physics is fundamentally an experimental science, you know. Rant over.

I&#39;m sorry to rectify.<br><br>Position and speed of a particle won&#39;t precisely coexist because quantum particles have characteristics which aren&#39;t basic speed and position, but once looked from afar look like this. It&#39;s like saying a painting is green viewed from afar and not blue anymore when you look up closely, while it is actually just composed of yellow and blue dots. It is NOT green, and have never been, but seen from afar you can without any noticeable change consider it is, which is why we still think particles have a speed and a position we can&#39;t measure. No : this is just something else.<br><br>Some points need to be cleared for the information part of the video. Information can&#39;t be compressed to a random-like sample, because you need to store the precise way to &quot;uncompress&quot; it, which is not random. Information can&#39;t be thought of as independent from human, since &quot;random&quot; has no definition else than &quot;that can&#39;t be predicted&quot;, implicitely : predicted by humans. Sad to say but if entropy just represents the share of the world that is disordered, having it unendedly increasing just says that the world fundamentally complexifies faster than we can ackowledge it. But that is not true because it is only regarding one experiment, but neglects the mental process combining the knowledge together between experiments. How did we get as far as knowing how galaxies move and particles behave if it was not the case ? We were even able to predict Higgs boson or the black holes before seeing them. Information is disorder ? Cleaning has to be done here, this is way too complex for such shortcuts.<br><br>Free will, aaaah... Do you really think that having random events in your mind gives you free will ? If it came from nowhere, not even you, do you still think it&#39;s yours and makes you free ? Come on. Stop being so dramatic about the universe being predictable. If it were, we couldn&#39;t manage to simulate it because it would take another universe to contain all its data and processings.

I think you can&#39;t define it without giving a method for the compression. If you define &quot;compresse the string &#39;00010&#39;&#39; as the fact that you can write it more simply, you can imagine a way of compression that is a dictionnary, for example : { &#39;00010 <del>&gt; 0, &#39;00000&#39;</del>&gt;1, etc} that can allows you to &quot;compress&quot; &#39;00010&#39;, following your definition. If one argue that the &quot;compression&quot; should not use an arbitrary dictionnary, one should remember that the way you compressed things ( &quot;repeat(0)&quot; for instance), also use a dictionnary (the english one).<br><br>- That leads me to my second interrogation: what do you define as random ? If you wish to pick a random binary number between, let&#39;s say, 0000000000 and 1111111111, you have \u00e0 chance to pick the number 0000000000, wich, following your definition, can be compressed as &quot;repeat(0)*10&quot;. So, is 0000000000 not random ? How many of the random numbers between 0000000000 and 1111111111 are not really randoms ? For me, that is a proof that you can&#39;t talk about &quot;compressing&quot; something without expliciting the space where the things you want to compress are, the compression function and the space of the resulting compressions (let&#39;s call it F). With this formalism, i agree that you can&#39;t compress anything in the F space, if your compression function was powerfull enough, without loosing information.<br><br>Given this formalism, which i believe is necessary, I think that the physical extrapolations you make are abusives.<br><br>Not that I say that the result is wrong, but the way you explained it doesn&#39;t seem logically convincing to me.

So ..  random vs deterministic<br>Say we have initial state 0101 and state transition rules (0 turns to 1, 1 turns to 0) then the states will be:<br>0101<br>1010<br>0101<br>..<br>Etc.<br>This is what I call deterministic (or non-random). We know every single state given the initial state and state transition rules. Now if after a few states I do this:<br><br>0101<br>1010<br>0111 &lt;- manually modified the state<br>1000<br>0111<br><br>This is random because given the initial state and the state transition rules I can\u2019t predict all the other states. The same definition applies to the universe, a state being the combination of all the unit \u201cparticles\u201d in the physical universe (and not just the ones that we think we know of), and transition rules being the unit \u201cforces\u201d that act on them.<br>Now, what I call entropy is the size of the minimum amount of information that is necessary to describe a state. For ex.<br><br>State 01011010 is two (01) followed by two (10). So let\u2019s say we have this state, and transition rules are (01 -&gt; 10) and (10 -&gt; 01). So the sequence is:<br>State         -------        Entropy<br>01011010 -&gt; two (01) followed by two (10)<br>10100101 -&gt; two (10) followed by two (01)<br>01011010 -&gt; two (01) followed by two (10)<br>\u2026<br>Etc<br>As we can see the entropy stays constant all the time, and we have a deterministic system. But now if we had the exact same initial state but transition rules (01) moves 2 digits to the right and (10) stays the same we\u2019ll have the sequence. <br><br>State         -------        Entropy<br>01011010 -&gt; two (01) followed by two (10)<br>10010110 -&gt; one (10) followed by two (01) followed by one (10)<br><br>As you can see, entropy increased here but we still have a non-random (deterministic) system. The universe could be the same way. If unit forces that act on the unit particles change the \u201clocation\u201d of a particle within the universe (given some small \u201cdistance\u201d in the change) we will still see a non-random universe with gradually increasing entropy.<br>So\u2026 increasing entropy does not entail random universe...<br><br>What say you?<br>Does anyone care?", "comment_date": "2016-05-21T02:05:08Z", "likes_count": 5}, {"comment_by": "Daniell Bondad", "comment_text": "If you can decode this within hours,you have a quick brain.<br>He entered in said house.Every read email,dotted<br>If you can understand this language,you likely live more than 20km north of me.<br>Ala eh!Pagkaganda ng anak ng mag-asawa na are.", "comment_date": "2016-05-20T13:12:55Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Niket Sharma", "comment_text": "so is our every choice and action a result of quantum particles or is it that when ww make a choice or imagine something then those particles generate new information in this universe because someone&#39;s imagination isn&#39;t <b>absolutely</b> predictable.", "comment_date": "2016-05-20T11:24:53Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Niket Sharma", "comment_text": "so is our every choice and action a result of quantum particles or is it that when ww make a choice or imagine something then those particles generate new information in this universe because someone&#39;s imagination isn&#39;t <b>absolutely</b> predictable.", "comment_date": "2016-05-20T11:24:51Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Esteban", "comment_text": "Guys beards gives you intelligence why do you think they both got beards?", "comment_date": "2016-05-20T02:08:47Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "UrFriscoAndNonelses", "comment_text": "And suddenly...

Well, it&#39;s probably poorly worded, I&#39;m a little sleepy at the moment, but..<br><br>You could call it shy dependency. Picture 2 dimensions, and a communication between them. You live in the first dimension, however you are able to observe the second. Observing the second takes a bit of time to receive the information, by which point the second dimension realises you are observing it and consequently changes its dependency upon your dimension. Lets use some basic equations to demonstrate what I mean: x = y+4, and y = x*2. Even though these two equations depend on each other, there is a clear value (x = -4). The moment x tries to find out what y equals, y reveals its value, but then changes it in some way based on what x is, for example it becomes y = x*5 (x&#39;s value to y is now -1). Now x finds out that y = x*2, but this information is already outdated. You could say x could try to predict the pattern that y uses to establish it&#39;s new formula, but y would realise that the next time y observes x and will then change the way it works according to the way it thinks x works.

Before putting forth such an hypothesis, we should ask whether free will exists at all. An alternate theory is that consciousness is &quot;epiphenomenal&quot;. That is, our thoughts are not the cause of our actions (obviously, they are correlated, so the theory would suggest that thoughts and actions have a common cause). Studies based on brain scans indicate that thoughts occur AFTER the initial neural impulse that causes actions. I don&#39;t understand how such a study can possibly work, but that&#39;s what I read in books that my college professors told me to read. Anyway, the upshot of epiphenomenalism is that &quot;free will&quot; is an illusion. One counter-argument is that if consciousness is epiphenomenal, then it would be a tremendous waste of energy, and therefore, would be very unlikely to survive natural selection. Of course, such arguments are generally dubious, because Evolution does NOT say that NS optimizes away all bad things; it only makes incremental improvements, one mutation at a time. Such features are known as vestigial. E.g. the human appendix appears to have negative survival benefit (an infection can kill you; whereas, people who have had their appendix removed do not seem to suffer lower mortality) yet we still have them. Examples of vestigial features that are more curious: whales sometimes have little stumps where their legs would be (such stumps increase energy required to swim), even though most members of the species do not have such stumps.

There is a part where the Veritasium fellow says that not all letters in a message convey the same <b>amount</b> of information, and he gives an example of this by saying that if we have the following message:<br><br><b>U-T-E-R-U-S</b><br><br>the last one or two letters could be &#39;predicted&#39; from the preceding ones, given the particular order in which they are arranged. This means, in this example, that if we were to have the message &quot;U-T-E-R-U&quot;, we could safely assume that the intended message is &quot;UTERUS&quot; and so we could deduce the letter &quot;S&quot; without it actually being in the original message. But this only holds true if you are assuming that the message is in the English language, and along with this assumption comes a vast amount of information (not contained in the original message) regarding the use of English language, the correct spelling of words, the frequency of words in normal usage of the language, and other things. So if you say that the last letters in our example above carry <b>less information</b> than the ones at the beginning you are making a mistake because you are taking for granted a big chunk of information that is not conveyed by the message itself. So my contention is that, without making any prior assumptions, the different letters in a message <b>do carry each the same amount of information</b>.<br><br>If we tried to predict the letters in a message without any outside information, then we would have no reason to think that &quot;UTERUS&quot; should be derived from &quot;U-T-E-R-U&quot;, because the message might as well be in a different language, or just be a random combination characters.<br><br>I just wanted to point that out and see if anyone would respond with any insights.", "comment_date": "2015-07-31T22:38:49Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Juan PdL", "comment_text": "Michael, a man of faith, next time on vsauce<br>", "comment_date": "2015-07-31T17:18:21Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Alvar Winquist", "comment_text": "So what you are meaning is that we can&#39;t predict the future but we could calculate what has happened?

He seems to be making a couple assumptions:<br><br>1. Determinism rules out free will in our universe.<br>2. Non-determinism (whatever you wanna call it) leaves room for free will.<br><br>Both these assumptions would be wrong. In the 1st case, because you can be a dualist and that way you could have free will and also determinism. In this case the mind would be made up of a different &#39;substance&#39; than matter, unbound from the constraints of determinism. In the 2nd case, there&#39;s also a problem, but before stating that I want to make a clarification of my own on the topic of determinism.<br><br>Determinism by definition does not mean &quot;being able to predict the future state of X&quot;. It means only that the state of a closed system determines all future states of that same system, regardless of our ability to calculate the actual outcomes. The double pendulum at the end is not undeterministic by the way; the pendulum does have chaotic motion when inertia is applied to it above a certain threshold, and yes we can&#39;t actually predict its motion with complete certainty, but that does not make it undeterministic. In fact, the butterfly effect is still a situation of determinism: the initial state, down to the most tiny fluctuations, fully determines the future states of the system. So again the fact that we cannot predict the future state of a system based on its current one does not make that system undeterministic.<br><br>Now about the 2nd assumption, that non-determinism leaves open the possibility of free will (or even encourages it). To say this seems to me like a desperate attempt to cling on to the idea of free will; it&#39;s as untenable an argument as your run-of-the-mill creationism/ID argument. If non-determinism were true, it still would not make it more likely that free will is possible. Note that we can still approach a probabilistic answer to the question &quot;where is the electron at time &#39;t&#39;?&quot;, so we are not completely in the blind. Also, the degree to which the future state of the electron is &quot;random&quot; does not tell us anything about free will, unless we are trying to make peace with the idea that, somehow, our choices operate at the level of somewhat random (not completely, because we can calculate the odds of certain outcomes) quantum events. What I&#39;m trying to say is; if you want to make the case for free will, it needs to be more specific than this. You should not just point to a place where science doesn&#39;t yet have all the answers and say &quot;there, there it is (or could be)&quot;. That is a fallacy.<br><br>In my opinion free will is an illusion; a consequence of being self-aware to such a degree as humans are. It&#39;s the way the brain makes things easier for us, bearable so to speak. And we can never really rid ourselves of the illusion, because the brain is wired in such a way as to inevitably pick up on it. Remember that Caf\u00e9 Wall optical illusion? You perceive the lines as slanted, but they really are parallel to each other. You can use a ruler or whatever method you like and see for yourself that the lines are indeed parallel to one another. But being aware of the illusion doesn&#39;t change the way our brain works: you still perceive the lines as oblique. The same thing happens, in my view, with free will: if it were ever substantially proven that humans (and all other animals for that matter) have no free will, we would still be feeling as though we have free will, and it won&#39;t change much our behaviour or our &quot;decisions&quot;.

On the other, how can any completely random element of our decision making process be something <b>we</b> do? It&#39;s random - it&#39;s not a product of your will, but a product of quantum fluctuations. If we define Free Will by referring to randomness, then that concept loses everything important about it. For instance, in ethics we often say that in order for someone to be morally blameworthy for an action, they need to do that thing of their own Free Will - it&#39;s not your fault if you were under mind-control. But if a Free choice comes down, ultimately, to only randomness, then how can we blame someone for Free actions? They just got a bad roll on their decision making check.<br><br>I agree with Dennet.

Whether I choose cherry or chocolate ice cream would not be a matter of free will, but environment and genetics. Whether I take my computer to a repair shop or throw it out a window to fix it is not exactly free will either, but problem solving. Free will tends to revolve more around self VS environment and environment VS environment changes. For example, whether you wish to see another suffer is determined by genetics and/or environment (almost always and). Whether you will find a way to make others suffer as a result of your desire to see them suffer would be where one would make their case against the traditional sense of free will. Ultimately, it comes down to whether one &#39;supports&#39; good or evil, but in a very vague and abstract sense of both words. What variables one <b>will</b> put out into the environment. Here I must separate hedonism from priority. We all act based on priorities, one cannot get past that. But we do not all act on desires. One should also recognize that desires have an overwhelming effect on priority, but one would have to make the case that it is deterministic before free will can be ruled out. Take for example martyrs. Different martyrs desire different things that are typically related to an ideal (promotion of a religion, protection of life, refusal to speak against an individual, etc). They desire life, and they desire what is related to their ideal. They may desire life more than their ideal, arguably, yet they prioritize their ideal above their life. Or maybe not. But <b>this</b> is where the discussion starts not &quot;I know you won&#39;t jump out of a moving car, therefore you don&#39;t have free will.&quot; Every religion since the beginning of time has recognized judgement as being separate from free will, and on a basic neurological level we know that different types of decisions are made by different systems.

Secondly, I feel like Einstein does have a point. If quantum mechanics is the building blocks of classical mechanics, why wouldn&#39;t the indeterministic effects of quantum mechanics impact the predictable nature of classical mechanics? Wouldn&#39;t the predictability of general relativity, Newtonian mechanics, gravity, and electromagnetism just break down under the influence of quantum mechanics? I&#39;m not saying that quantum mechanics can&#39;t be indeterministic on a nanoscale, but I always just assumed that the compilation of many quantum objects would just cause the probabilities to gradually converge onto a deterministic state, not that the indeterministic nature of the quantum level would actually impact the classical level.

The reason for this can be seen when you compare your claim: that order is less random than disorder; e.g. a string of 0&#39;s contains less information than a complex string - and is thus more ordered, with the the claim that the universe will reach maximum entropy and all hard drives will eventually read strings of only 0&#39;s. Equating information with entropy is not the issues, for that is a mathematical one, the philosophical issue as you may see lies in equating information with order. If your hard drive is more ordered by containing less information, you conflict with the universe being less ordered with less information. In the first case low information equates to high order, while in the second it equates to low order - implying the heat death model that is.

We know that hundreds of thousands of years ago when Man first started to settle down, we had adapted to a lifestyle with dogs. Brought them in, raised them, hunted with them, and so on. They helped keep us safe, and helped to provide food. So, as we grew through the ages with them, we didn&#39;t have as much of a need to be bigger, faster, stronger, or have keener senses. <br><br>So for this question, in a reality where we never took dogs into our lives, never used any sort of pet or companion to help us survive and hunt and it was only ever humans, how would we have turned out today? Would we be bulkier? Faster? Leaner? Could we have developed ultra-sensitive smelling or hearing to help us get food for our settlements? Or even without dogs or pets and through the advancement of our own tools, would we still end up in the general shape and size that we have now? I&#39;d love to hear your thoughts on this.

In this way, random is only non-compressible so long as it remains un-generated... the moment you record it, I can design an algorithm to compress it, much in the same way that quantum behavior resolves to a known state once you observe it. So the only truly non-compressible form of information would be a quantum nibble: that is, an undefined byte of information which is indeterminable as 0 or 1. I can&#39;t compress that, but on its own it is anti-information (we call this &quot;corruption&quot; if it happens to your hard disk) \u00a0it means less than null because even null tells me the bytes aren&#39;t used. \u00a0In this, information is not simply pattern, but rather, pattern with some utility (a quantum nibble can be information if it is null, because its utility is known). \u00a0The compressible parts of a video are those with the least utility. \u00a0The more utility a pattern has, the less you can compress it and maintain a state of &quot;information&quot; therefore, there is a point of video compression where you lose the ability to recover utility-bearing portions, and at exactly that point, information decreases as randomization increases. \u00a0If you accept this pattern + utility view, suddenly, information has a second component: the reception of the information. \u00a0Tax law has both pattern, and utility... when received by the correct party (for example a college student trying to maximize his grant potential) \u00a0but when delivered to a homeless person who begs for their food, the utility is so low as to render it akin to white noise (actually white noise has high order and utility to a sound engineer in certain circumstances, demonstrating that it is a specific kind of information, casting doubt on your claim that it is random, but that&#39;s a whole other can of worms!). \u00a0Because of this send/receive nature of information, it is not enough to have a pattern, it is important to also understand the surroundings and impact of the pattern (or even non-pattern): in summation, a dice roll holds a very different potential for information on a craps table than it does when accidentally dropped on the floor by a two-year-old.", "comment_date": "2014-08-13T07:34:23Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Cosmalano", "comment_text": "I love the whole &quot;12 fundamental particles interacting in 4 different ways.&quot; But the thing that bothers me is, what about positrons?

It&#39;s defined as the measure of disorderness of a state. For example, If i supply energy to a physical state, in principle it&#39;s entropy should increase, since disorderness increases. Yes and no! For instance, how many of you are familiar with 2nd order Phase transition of ferromagnetic materials? For those who are not, what basically happens, is that there exist a critical temperature around which upon increasing the thermodynamical variable, i.e temperature, Entropy starts decreasing, because evidently, the dipoles(or spins) starts alligning in some desired direction around this temperature, thus decreasing the measure of disorderness or as one would say, decreasing entropy.

If you think about it our entire lives centre around this concept, It explains almost every aspect of human behaviour I mean all religions at the core have a fundamental dedication to order. The belief in a meaning of life is in fact a belief that there is order to our existence. If we consider religious organisations and their patterns we see that consistently there masses or processions involve a sense of establishment and similarly with other non-religious organisations there is an obsession with order. If we take the Nazi/communist rallies for instance, some described them as awe inspiring religious experiences. Why? Because it was a display of structure, of symmetry and order. This may have something to do with the fact we are fundamentally ordered. Our lives can only exist because of the ordering of molecules into finite structures which form DNA which allows life to reproduce itself and grow. Perhaps that explains our infatuation of order. Order represents life itself and perhaps deep within the core of our programming is a demand to maintain structure so that we can continue to exist. It also explains why things that are disorderly are often associated with death. There is a conflict with in all of us between a need for order but also a yearning for disorder. This explains humans desire to destroy structures and humanity\u2019s obsession entropy and with fire (which in essence is the disordering of the molecules of the substance being burnt). We enjoy the Idea of Anarchy because it adds entropy to our lives, we desire freedom because freedom in actuality is lack of order to our life. If we think about the kind of things we associate with rebellion and anarchy I am immediately drawn to rock music, which centres around a distorted, often chaotic guitar melody and riff. War often involves destroying structures, people\u2019s homes and lives. Why do some enjoy this experience? \u00a0because they are disordering the elements of people\u2019s lives that were once ordered. Perhaps this explains why those who go to war or even start a war are those who are \u201coutcasts\u201d who have no place in structure of society. \u00a0By destroying structures they are providing themselves with a capability to re-order society to better suit them. What ancient Christian and Islamic writers describe as evil is often that which causes disorder and chaos and many of that which is considered goods creates order and provides people with a meaning or purpose to their lives.

Since few times I see Veritasium talking a lot about digital and binary system and making a lot of parallel between our &#39;reality&#39; and our digital world. So I would like to expose my theory. In informatique everything is binary. stored in your computer memory or hard drive. Everything is full of 0 or 1. So when you run a program, you run a complet set of 0 or 1. In a program we can see 2 kinds of usage for those binary content. First is the data (images, sounds, video, numbers, texts, etc.) but there is another kind of usage: the program itself. The process to run/use the datas. so in your executable (0/1) file, you have data and process. And we can consider the process as the energy (not only of course) to run the datas. So if we do a parallel with our universe, and if we consider the Einstein theory: matter is energy and energy is matter. So everything is energy, or everything is matter. and what is matter? Matter is a set of fundamental particles. exactly like our simple 0/1 content. So the particles of the universe is the data of the universe. and sometimes this matter become energy and run the process of the universe. Exactly like a computer using a file like a program or like real data (images or videos, etc.).

In general there are many microscopic states that all form the same macroscopic state, but the exact number differs from (macroscopic) state to state.<br>Let&#39;s consider the example a series of zeros and ones:<br>The macrospcoic quantities would be the total numbers of 1s and 0s.The microscopic state would describe wether a digit is a 1 or a 0.<br>An example: The macroscopic state &quot;1x 1 and 1x 0&quot; can be generated by two different microscopic states &quot;01&quot; and &quot;10&quot;. This would be a state of high entropy.<br>The macroscopic state &quot;2x 0&quot;, on the other hand, can only be formed by one microscopic state: &quot;00&quot;. This is a state of low entropy.<br><br>Now, let&#39;s look at information: The total amount of information needed to describe a state in the above example is the same for all states: 2 bits.<br>What changes is the amount of information we can gain, if we know the macroscopic state beforehand and then learn how the microscopic state looks like.<br>If I knew the macroscopic state is &quot;2x 0&quot;, I would automatically know how the microscopic state would look like: &quot;00&quot;. I would learn nothing new. (Remember, this was a state of low entropy!)<br>But if we considered a state of high entropy like &quot;1x 1 and 1x 0&quot;, we wouldn&#39;t know exactly how the microscopic state would look like: It could be &quot;10&quot; or &quot;01&quot;.<br>So we would gain new information about the system by learning how the microscopic state looks like.<br><br>In this sense and only in this sense it is valid to say that entropy equals information:<br>Entropy equals the information one can gain, if one already knows the macroscopic state and then learns about the microscopic state of a system.<br>Entropy equals NOT the total information stored in a system.\u00a0 \u00a0<br>This especially means that an increasing entropy does not imply an increase of the total information stored in a system!

If we would presume all of this, your last reason why it woudn&#39;t be able to go faster than light was this: The atoms, or better yet, the electrons that keep everything together are moving at the speed of light, and if the tip would be moving FTL, the electrons woudn&#39;t be capable of holding it together. Now think of a car which is moving with 100km/h, the air inside is stationary(as far as it can be) to the rest of the car.

It&#39;s so sad to see some of the top &quot;science video bloggers&quot; on YouTube being so wrong about so much fundamental knowledge. But it&#39;s common for psychological reasons. I&#39;ll explain:<br><br>The easiest thing to talk about first that you&#39;re getting wrong is free will. It&#39;s BS, whether one even concedes that the universe is deterministic or not has no bearing on free will being fundamentally an impossibility, see the wiki article on &quot;dilemma of determinism.&quot; If your actions aren&#39;t determined (by you or whatever else) then they&#39;re random, meaning you still have no control over it, so the idea of free will is a total paradox and only exists through cognitive dissonance because it makes us feel better to think we are in control and we don&#39;t have to be logical about what we believe, like so much philosophy. But it makes your videos more appealing to people I guess.<br><br>And aside from that you were so close to being right, realizing that the universe would be completely deterministic if information was constant. But then you had to bring in the entropy argument from the second law of thermodynamics. Problem is, it&#39;s just straight up wrong if you&#39;re trying to say it applies to the universe. It doesn&#39;t. The irony of course is that you gave us the easy way of explaining why you&#39;re wrong when you said the universe doesn&#39;t &quot;stir itself up.&quot; What are nebulas, stars, planets, heck what happened between the big bang and today in general? Did the universe need some outside force to get all this order instead of a giant uniform soup after the big bang? No of course not. There are several ways to explain why this is. The obvious one is that the second law of thermodynamics was never meant to be applied to the universe but people offhandly still think it does, ignoring all the fundamental forces that invalidate it that led to ordered systems like stars, planets and people. And the laws we know of explain this and all of them are completely deterministic... which you seem to know right up until you decide to ignore all that.<br><br>You understand how compression works and that there are higher order patterns that explain why there&#39;s a lot less information in the universe than we think (we think being the key word), even things like the equation that describes gravity and how it can govern so much of what happens in the universe, and you decide not to take the inductive reasoning step (&quot;This is what all the evidence says so the universe is deterministic&quot;) and instead say &quot;but maybe the reason why we can&#39;t compress quantum mechanics further...&quot; And here&#39;s how you can tell you&#39;re wrong. You run to the edge of our knowledge to try and back your position (quantum mechanics) which is very common for your position because there&#39;s basically nowhere else to turn to. Your argument whether you realize it or not is an argument from ignorance, a standard informal fallacy, that&#39;s demonstrably wrong because you&#39;re basing it entirely on gaps in our knowledge which runs against all of the things we actually do know. Also, this belief is cognitive dissonance as well if you understand macro physics and probability theory.<br><br>QM is still new and you&#39;re making a completely invalid assumption in saying our understanding will never improve (total assumption) therefore it&#39;s the source of randomness that we conveniently can&#39;t find in anything else we understand except a law that doesn&#39;t actually apply. You can demonstrate you&#39;re wrong because of basic probability theory (see: law of large numbers, law of significant figures). QM can&#39;t actually be random because if it was then we couldn&#39;t have models that work on the macro scale AT ALL. Probabilistic equations couldn&#39;t work either. That hypothetical supposed randomness would only aggregate as you use equations to model the macro world based on the micro equations but guess what, we don&#39;t see chaos in the macro world. QM behaves exactly as it should given that on that scale you need exponentially more knowledge to be more in the ballpark of what the right answer is (see chaos theory). Einstein called it right because he knew what he was talking about, our understanding just isn&#39;t there yet when it comes to QM which you, and most other people, fail to concede.<br><br>In other words, take the extra step with respect to information and patterns instead of ignoring it. You have the principle right. As you mentioned, we know how to compress videos to 1/1000 of their size already and someone has estimated the english language to be 70-75% redundant... well after we make more powerful, intelligent computers that can see higher order patterns that we can&#39;t even imagine why wouldn&#39;t it tend to 1/infinity and 99.9repeating% like in a limit function?

I mean, if a random event (fluctuation) happens in a random place in random time, influencing the world via the Kazimier&#39;s force, for instance, than each time such event happens, the universe in some way divides into different universes, in each of which that event happened in a different place in different time.

If we were able to measure the exact position and momentum of each particle in our reality (which is surely impossible due to the Heisenberg uncertainty principle) and in each other reality, could we look back into the past? Could we recollect all those events in all possible realities and measure the positions and momentums of all particles in a certain reality in a certain place in a certain time?<br>The concept that makes my mind explode is time travels.

For example, 1 computer can indeed plot out the path of 1 particle. 2 would likely be able to plot the path of 2. If 1 billion could, between them, perfectly predict a 1-billion-particle system in 2 times real time, one would expect it to take 4 billion to predict the interactions between 4 billion particles in real time. Above that scale, the actual physical ability to predict the future of a chaotic system slows down. The Time complexity of the system isn&#39;t linear, it is O(N^2). Similarly, predicting not just what happens when a synapse in a deterministic being&#39;s brain fires or does not, but predicting whether it will fire as as intended or not with 100% certainty, is extremely computationally expensive, potentially requiring one to calculate O(N^2)-complexity functions on every last particle in the entire observable universe. This is all without quantum mechanics even being involved.<br><br>So for free will to appear, you only need an illusion of randomness. You only need it to be effectively infeasible for anything within the universe to make predictions. As far as a human is concerned, video game characters can have free will if their behavior is pseudorandom or governed by programming that is too complex for them to predict accurately in real time.<br><br>A quote from I forget whom: &quot;If the brain were so complex that we could understand it, we would be so simple that we couldn&#39;t.&quot;<br><br>In other words, the required amount of computational power to guess what will happen goes up faster than linearly with the system&#39;s complexity and the amount of external input. Practically speaking, there is totally unpredictable input. Light from deep space, for example, it being moving at the speed of light, is untraceable. Determining when an astronaut will suddenly be hit by a Gamma ray and where they will be hit is fundamentally not something that is possible to do within the known laws of physics, even ignoring quantum mechanical effects. That has effectively produced randomness. Maybe it damages a specific few cells in their brain? Maybe not.

If there is a sequence of binary numbers that is completely random, then it will not create something, it does not have meaning, and cannot be classified as information. It would be meaningless. Secondly, if you were able to know all the information in the universe, you would be able to know the exact rate at which entropy is increasing. The amount of information in the universe is constant, but this information is being altered in a fashion that consistently tends towards entropy, in compliance with the 2nd law of Thermodynamics.

Surely a purely classical system still exhibits this property. Take for example a sealed box of gas, which begins in an initial state where all the gas is on one side. This is an extremely orderly state with little information. Ignoring any quantum mechanics, and treating the gas molecules as 100% deterministic classical little spheres, this system will indeed evolve over time into a state where the gas is spread evenly throughout the box. Even with no randomness allowed a simple, deterministic system has experienced an increase of entropy and information that came from &quot;no where&quot;.<br>In fact I&#39;d even say pointing to quantum mechanics as the driving force of entropy is just plain incorrect.<br>Chaos theory is basically an entire study into the fact that deterministic, nonrandom systems can indeed behave very complexly, even to the point of spontaneous self-organization. In fact, chaotic systems have the property that a minute perturbation (even of size arbitrarily close to 0) in initial conditions leads to drastic differences in outcome. Put another way, given some final state, even a deterministic system cannot accurately &quot;remember&quot; its initial conditions if it is chaotic, which sounds a lot like entropy and the arrow of time to me.<br><br>EDIT: Okay I ranted before I finished the last few seconds of video, but my point still stands--quantum mechanics is unnecessary to explain the increasing entropy of the universe.", "comment_date": "2014-07-18T06:22:18Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Evgeni Kirilov", "comment_text": "Wasn&#39;t there a recent paper - a hypothesis, really, not even a full theory - that what looked like random quantum interactions was a product of the interaction between the waves / ripples of the fabric of the universe?

The other is gained from something once it is defined, and is thus is derived information.<br><br>\u00a0 For instance the letters of a sentence would be the used information, while the meaning of the sentence, and thus what sentences will follow is derived information. \u00a0Thus a cohesive well written text would develop more derived information than an ill written text much like this one which would bananas be bonkers yo. \u00a0The last part of that sentence adds nothing by itself, it is an increase in the entropy of what I am saying. \u00a0Yet its effect and amount of entropy can be measured with the used information of this text.<br><br>While used information does go up in accordance with entropy for the sake of describing it this does not hold the same with derived information.

If the coin was the only thing in the universe, it would spin forever because it is impossible for the coin to make a decision by itself. However, this cannot be the case because in fact, there are other things in the universe and each particle has an influence on the coin in some way. The coin would be forced to make a decision because of the circumstances it faces. e.g a hand slams the coin onto the ground. The coin is not conscious of its decision and neither is the person who used the hand but once the smoke clears the universe is informed of the decision. We learn that a decision took place and we also know what the decision was. We could guess the face that the coin would land on but we couldn&#39;t know for certain so to find out, we did a procedure that forced the coin to stop so that we could know. We couldn&#39;t guess what the outcome would be and we still couldn&#39;t guess the outcome after 5000 repetitions of the same event. But was it the same every time?

If the universe could be summed up by an initial state, and laws about how the state of things develop over time, then the universe would appear to have an increasing amount of information from one moment to another, but only for someone who does not know the initial state and all the laws.<br><br>EXAMPLE: If the universe was a spread on a pool table, then the initial state is very easy to describe. It would only be some balls positioned in a tight triangle, while another ball was moving at some speed towards this triangle. However, 2 seconds after the ball hits the triangle of tightly packed balls, one would need a LOT more bits to accurately describe the state of the table (without the initial state). But fact is that if you knew the initial state, and all the laws, you would still only need the same amount of information to describe the state; the initial state, the laws, and the time, t, of the state.<br><br>This fact is demonstrated in most compressed videos. A movie containing a thousand images, can be compressed down to a lot less information than what the sum of all the images individually can be compressed to. You kind of mentioned it yourself in the previous video.<br><br>Also, there might be another part of our universe that is decreasing in entropy as our part of the universe is increasing in entropy. If the smallest bits of our universe were a googol times smaller than the smallest particles we know, then the information at this incredibly small scale could be decreasing as the information moves &quot;up the latter&quot; to the universe we know and love. That is sort of the nature of information and patterns. We see difference on one scale at the expense of difference on another scale. We see a dog and a cat instead of soup of chaos and seemingly identical soup of chaos. In complete chaos on the particle scale, humongous monsters of patterns like humans would not exist. There is probably some scale at which each cubic of this scale seem identical (be it a googol times the size of the observable universe). But as time goes by, it is easy to picture that patterns of greater and greater size emerges, and so that the &quot;scale of homogeneity&quot; would increase. And the average information within each cubic-(something smaller) individually would decrease as a necessity for this to be the case.<br><br>My point is that all the information you need to produce any state in time of the universe might be less than what you need to accurately describe any persons DNA, this video, or a pair of socks for that matter :P ...

Lets say I have an enclosed system, it contains a liquid and a hot metal sphere, the liquid is cooler than the sphere, so the liquid is in a low state of entropy, and the ball is in a high state of entropy, because it has more moving particles aka energy. Now over time the system moves to a state of maximum entropy, most disorder, and here is where I get confused, the energy in the metal ball would dissapate and spread evenly over the liquid and the ball, untill the energy in the system is spread out evenly, this would mean its maximum entropy is reached. I am kinda typing this to figure out what is happening, I guess that it does hold true that the system is at maximum entropy when the energy is spread out evenly, because there is no difference in entropy levels anywhere. There is more information, every part of the system has some energy, but overall the system is the same temperature, that seems orderly right?

The whole talk of entropy and information made me recall something that Sean Carroll said in a video while discussing Naturalism with other philosophers and scientists. I think it may have some implications concerning the things you say, but then again, maybe it doesn&#39;t, I&#39;m no expert. Still, I think it&#39;s a really beautiful analogy, so I guess I&#39;ll share it anyway.\u00a0<br><br>In the video he says something like this: You can Imagine the universe as a cup of coffee with milk. The initial system is one in which the milk and the coffee are completely separated, the milk on top and the coffee on the bottom. A system such as this would be very simple to describe (it has little information). Then you can imagine someone shaking the coffee with milk until it&#39;s a perfect mix. The resulting system would also be one that&#39;s very simple to describe, you could just say the whole thing is evenly mixed. If the first system is analogous to the early universe (low entropy) and the second system is analogous to the late universe (maximum entropy), then you can imagine a middle step which would be analogous to the universe we live now, the middle universe(?). In this system of coffee and milk, you would find the mix halfway to becoming perfectly even, this stage of the system would be very hard to describe (a lot of information) because it would require you to take into account every little detail, for example, a tiny sector in which a spiral of milk with a very specific size and shape curls into the coffee. He goes on to say that in a way, this tells us that one would expect some kind of complexity to arise every now and then from the natural process of the second law, and maybe us humans in our amazing complexity are kind of like that spiral of milk, still not evenly mixed.<br><br>A couple of questions emerged from contrasting this words with what you say about information being the same as entropy. First: Isn&#39;t it correct that a maximum entropy system would be very simple to describe and therefore low in information? And wouldn&#39;t this make entropy and information at the very least not directly related? And second: Is there anyway we can guarantee what we call information isn&#39;t always limited by the way we choose to describe a system? Like how little information the temperature of a room is compared to the vast information necessary to describe the energy of each molecule in the room. I think it might all have to do with the poor understanding I have of concepts such as entropy, but I thought my concern was worth sharing.<br><br>Again, thank you for this video.

The collective to create this machine would need to sustain and dedicate itself and the construction long enough and already have an encapsulated moment to be fed in from the distant less entropic past.

This idea of information = entropy is something I have never heard of on the internet personally, and definitely never in the famous youtube science channels.<br><br>So, this got me thinking... What if the four fundamental forces are just actually like &quot;scientists&quot; discovering the world every instant of existence? The four forces all research each particle&#39;s position each planck time and tell the particle which way to go next based on the current circumstance. Therefore, the future is not set in stone, but rather the future is being discovered every planck time; as it is occurring. This would allow some of the strange effects of quantum physics to occur, as there is no predicting what the state of the particle is, but as it becomes observed, the four forces study the particle and the act of you measuring it and apply a force on them to change them accordingly.<br><br>\u00a0This leads to something even more interesting; what if if the universe is just an experiment being run in a computer? The four forces are four different programs that read and direct the experiment every planck time. The big bang was maybe just a code that starts a new universe every time the old one has crunched or ends up with infinite entrophy as a soup of evenly spread particles. It just puts in a very large amount of energy in a point that expands and forms matter and our universe today. So that would mean that in the grand scheme of things, our self-titled &quot;intelligence&quot; may just be like the artificial life in the computer like in that Tron movie, arose out of itself.<br><br>\u00a0But back to topic, interestingly, our growth in technology has to do in some distant way to the increase of knowledge in the universe every day. As scientists are observing the matter they are testing on, whether quantum or not, they are still using the creation of new information out of nothing. So, this increase of our technology, and even living day to day life cannot be possible without this increase of information. Now consider if we could capture 20% of all of the new information being created on earth or in our solar system. This would boost our technology levels quite quickly, i presume. Of course the important part would be the organization and easy retrieval of the information in a data bank, but once we achieve that, we could even perhaps have computers do the discovering themselves, looking over the information and analyzing any unexpected results. This would be a discovering machine, and would form the most comprehensive model of our universe possible. With this model, scientists can formulate hypotheses over the actual equations that govern our universe.<br><br>Just some thoughts, but I do believe that this topic and others like this has much to discuss and no one doing the discussing.

True, quantum particles are non-deterministic but zooming out on a macro scale, say atomic level, almost all products of reactions can be anticipated with some given conditions, which are deep-rooted principles for typical systems we use like internal combustion engines or nuclear reactors. In a way, that has dominating nature in our own free will as well. Thinking is a result of ionic imbalances in neurons resulting in graded action potentials, causing a synchronous firing in groups (nucleus or ganglion), with some sensory input. Therefore, it&#39;s safe to say that all biological systems are predictable, that&#39;s why we all have our own distinct anticipatory behaviours, annexed by our DNA, which is a mere information that encodes us all. As for colossal masses like planets, stars, galaxies and quasars are mostly governed by law of gravitation. The attempt to get to a unified field theory is to succinctly state the equation where all physical forces can be characterised and that, I believe, is predictability despite randomness. It could only mean gathering all information of the universe (i.e not an &#39;isolated&#39; system unlike say Earth) at a specific point in time to predict the future, which is impossible. Bottom line, I strongly doubt if quantum mechanics is the one responsible for increase of entropy, but instead something macroscopic than that.\u00a0", "comment_date": "2014-07-16T19:29:47Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "DavidsKanal", "comment_text": "Very informative!", "comment_date": "2014-07-16T19:29:36Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Nathan Hart", "comment_text": "If you can read this you can get a good job with high pay is what it says", "comment_date": "2014-07-16T19:29:08Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Stefan Manolescu", "comment_text": "so pi is really random?<br>i mean i doesn&#39;t repeat but it can be predicted", "comment_date": "2014-07-16T19:28:37Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "serialcomplexity", "comment_text": "Dark matter and energy simply enough then must be entropy itself since it is massively developing within all things at an ever expanding rate therefore  expanding the space itself, yes?

So essentially, it could be that all the particles/waves are well within the scope of predictability if it weren&#39;t for the quantum foam compromised of virtual particles that interferes with everything. My theory is that while the effects of virtual particles are minuscule to well established forces that hold matter together, any wave with small enough interference can be effected by this, increasing its entropy such that it can then interfere with stronger waves to produce bizarre effects such as quantum tunneling.", "comment_date": "2014-07-16T19:08:20Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Ryan Harding", "comment_text": "Let&#39;s assume that the universe is totally predictable, for the sake of argument.
