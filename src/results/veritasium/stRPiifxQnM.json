This is because I failed to realize the change in tension on the dense ball when it was submerged.  It&#39;s a great experiment and I feel like I learned something from watching it.  <br><br>However, I do not like the explanation!  Third law arguments always seem to involve force-pairs, but it really bugs me when these seem to be conjured one at a time only until a desired result is reached.  On the left (ping-pong) we see a three-vector solution... that&#39;s an odd number...one of the vectors isn&#39;t getting paired.  <br><br>Also, &quot;The downward force on the water is almost entirely counteracted by the upward force of the tension of that string on the bottom of that beaker.&quot;  Isn&#39;t that a bit like lifting yourself up by your own boot straps?  Can this be right??  (Admittedly I answered the original question incorrectly, so, please tell me if I&#39;m missing something).  Let&#39;s say I added a coiled spring that happened to be the same density as water, and that it doubled the tension in the ping-pong ball&#39;s thread, would that therefore further reduce the weight of the beaker?  What if a housefly (who happened to be only as dense as air) were trapped, sealed inside the ping-pong ball, flying upward with as much force as it could muster, pressing against the top?  What if I replaced the ping-pong ball with a toy submarine of identical volume and density, but this toy had a propeller that spun vigorously, tripling the tension in the tether-thread, would that further reduce the weight of the beaker?  In all these cases, the supposedly counteractive tension of the thread on the bottom of the beaker is increased, but I do not think any of them would alter the weight of the beaker.  <br><br>The way I see it (again, please correct me if I&#39;m wrong) is that each pan of that balance is supporting a certain similar-but-separate set of atoms.  If we sum their weights, we find that everything is equal except for the atoms that make up the balls.  Each (average) cubic millimeter of the solid ball weighs more than the same volume of the ping-pong ball, we total those weights, and subtract any other force from outside the beakers (none for the ping-pong ball, a small thread-tension for the dense ball).  <br><br>Put another way, the values are identical to what we&#39;d have measured if there were no buoyancy effects, the beakers were full of an equal mass of ice, and, resting atop the ice, were the balls, the dense one with just a tiny amount of tension holding it up (the difference between its weight and the weight of an equivalent volume of water) exerting a net downward force of the mass of the dense ball minus the small, supporting tension vector; and the ping-pong ball, whether just resting on the ice, stuck to the bottom with a slack piece of spider silk, or lashed to the bottom of the beaker with an extremely taught kevlar thread, in all cases exerting the same net gravitational force (i.e. g times the mass of the ping-pong ball (and the negligible mass of the thread, regardless of how tight or lose that thread might be)).<br><br>I don&#39;t see the tension of the ping-pong ball&#39;s thread as capable of making any difference to the overall weight of the beaker.  <br><br>I also don&#39;t see the buoyancy negative pair vector (the &quot;equivalent downward force on the water&quot;) as &quot;pushing&quot; the beaker (and, thus, the balance pan) downward and needing to be counteracted by some third (unpaired) internal tension vector.  The ping-pong ball cannot push the water, beaker, or balance-pan downward by a force any greater than its own weight.<br><br>Again, I appreciate the experiment.

Can I ask what your thoughts were prior to seeing the answer? I admit I got it wrong because I naively thought that the ping pong ball added to the weight of the left beaker, whereas the right beaker and fluid would just &quot;move around&quot; the stationary ball unaffected. On reflection I see this is wrong because it fails to consider the changing shape of the fluid in the right beaker. I think this actually leads to a more intuitive alternate explanation; consider the potential energy of the fluid. If you raise the left beaker, you just shift all of the fluid upwards by that distance. But if you raise the right beaker, on top of shifting all of the fluid upwards by that distance, you also have to shift some of the liquid even further up, because the ball has moved downwards through the beaker and displaced fluid. So the fluid on the right gains more potential energy for the same height increase than the fluid on the left, and so the apparatus attains a stable, lower energy state by tipping clockwise.

For the ping pong ball to stay still the push downwards and the buoyancy force upwards must perfectly cancel each other: hence the module of the push equals the module of the buoyancy, namely the weight of the water displaced.

And that weight is the only thing contributing to a downward force on left side of balance. On the right the downward force on the balance is due to the weight of beaker, the weight of water, the bouyant force down of the acrylic ball minus whatever weight of the ball the string is carrying. Note the weight of the ball is supported partially by the string and partially by the bouyant force. <br>  So the only force the acrylic ball places on the balance is the bouyant force - the string takes the rest of the weight - and since the amount of water and weight of beaker between left and right is the same, this means the only extra force on the right side of scale is the bouyant force of the acrylic ball. <br>  So at this point the right is heavier by the bouyant force. <br>  However when you submerge the ping pong ball with your finger, you are now applying an external force to the left side. To just submerge the ping pong ball you need to apply a force equal to its bouyant force of the ping pong ball. <br>  The bouyant force is proportional to the weight of the water displaced by an object. <br>  And the ping pong ball and the acrylic ball are the same size, so when each is submerged their bouyant forces will be equal. And since this force was the only difference between left and right side of balance before you pushed on the ping pong ball, when you push in the ping pong ball you apply an equal force to the left side as is being applied to the right. Since the forces on both sides of the balance are now equal the balance will be balanced.

They are both cups full of water and when I lift them I lift the cup and the water inside the cup, and they are both subject to the same force of gravity - so why are their weights different?

But I&#39;ve got it now and have a good way of explaining it:<br><br>The beaker with the ping pong ball in is a closed, independent system. Whatever forces are exerted inside the beaker by the water and the tension in the string etc. makes no difference because the ball is tethered to the beaker itself so all internal forces balance out. Essentially you just have a beaker, some water, a ping pong ball and some string and the total weight is just the weights of the individual items added together.<br><br>In the case of the other beaker, because the acrylic ball is tethered to the outside world (not through the beaker) the forces don&#39;t cancel each other out. When the ball is submerged the water exerts a force on it in all directions, this is pressure, but we&#39;re only interested in the vertical forces. The overall vertical force is upwards, because the water pressure is higher at the bottom of the ball than the top of the ball because it&#39;s slightly deeper (think of the fact that the ball would sink slower than it would fall through air, so you know there is a force pushing the ball up, although not as high as the gravitational force pulling the ball down). This buoyancy force tries to push the ball upwards, but since the weight of the ball is greater, the force pushes the scales down instead. This force is equal to the weight of the water displaced by the ball i.e. a sphere of water exactly the same size as the acrylic ball( because that amount of water is forced above the ball), but more importantly, a sphere of water the same size as the ping pong ball.<br><br>Now all you have to ask yourself is which is the higher force, the weight of the ping pong ball and the string, or the weight of a sphere of water the same size as the ping pong ball. We know the ping pong ball is less dense than water, because it floats, so the buoyant force on the acrylic ball is higher than the weight of the ping pong ball (and the string, because it weighs so little), so overall this pushes down on the scales more on the acrylic ball side.", "comment_date": "2015-04-18T09:46:59Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "anewone4", "comment_text": "C", "comment_date": "2015-04-18T09:40:24Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Alexandru Ungureanu", "comment_text": "B<br>If you can hold the ping pong ball just below the surface of the water, making sure it is completely submerged, the balance will stay the same as the two sides of the balance are pushed down by the same amount of force due to them 2 balls displacing the same amount of water.

In this new case where you are pushing down on the ball there is an external force acting on the system, your hand.<br><br>My final reason for considering C as my answer comes from analyzing the situation in the same way it was analyzed at the beginning of the video. Considering the beaker and water as one system and the ping pong ball as another system then the argument goes as follows:\u00a0<br>* The ball experiences a buoyant force up equal to the amount of water displaced.<br>* By Newton&#39;s third law the beaker+water must experience an equal force down.<br>* This means the beaker+water has an effective weight of the water+beaker+buoyant force.<br><br>It was explained that the buoyant force, that is the weight of water displaced by the balls, are exactly the same. Therefore, the effective weight of the beakers are the same because the 2 balls experience the same buoyant force.", "comment_date": "2015-04-18T07:44:15Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Afshaan Khan", "comment_text": "Ok, I think it will be balanced because the force from pushing the ping-pong ball down will equal or cancel out the downward force and weight from the water displacement of the acryclic ball.", "comment_date": "2015-04-18T07:39:38Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Hyrum Losee", "comment_text": "C", "comment_date": "2015-04-18T07:35:50Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Yong Smors", "comment_text": "C<br>", "comment_date": "2015-04-18T07:34:31Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Nazar Maksymchuk", "comment_text": "B", "comment_date": "2015-04-18T07:26:19Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "alexanderx33", "comment_text": "C.

And that force will always be equal in size to the gravitational force of the displaced liquid.<br><br>Acrylic ball is fully submerged, so the buoyancy will be equal to the gravitational force of a ball made out of water with the same dimensions as the acrylic ball (i.e. displaced amount of water). That makes the acrylic side of the scale heavier exactly by the displaced amount of water. Acrylic is more dense than water but the remaining weight of the ball is suspended on the rope, so that extra weight does not effect the scale.<br><br>I see that some people think that the whole weight of the acrylic ball is supported by the rope. That is not the case. As soon as you displace water, that results in buoyancy, even if the submerged object is denser than water. Think of it this way; if you suspend a ping pong ball from a rope and dip it in water, you wouldn&#39;t expect the ping pong ball to sink, just because the weight of the ball is supported by the rope and that therefore the water would have no effect on the ping pong ball. The ping pong will in fact float on the water regardless of if it is suspended by a rope or not. So why would then acrylic ball not experience any buoyancy just because it&#39;s attached to a rope even though it is displacing water? It wouldn&#39;t.<br><br>Now onto the ping pong ball side. It is true that the ping pong ball is displacing the same amount of water as acrylic ball (since they are identical in size). But the difference is that the ping pong ball is only submerged in water because it is attached to the bottom of a beaker, therefore the weight of the extra displaced amount of water is countered by the force of the ping pong ball pulling the beaker up. You can think of it this way; if you stand on a scale and apply a downward force on your head with your hands, that won&#39;t make you heavier. You also can&#39;t make yourself lighter or even lift yourself by grabbing your legs and trying to lift them. I think that&#39;s what you call a closed system. Even though you can easily lift yourself off the ground if you hang onto a rope, you can&#39;t lift yourself by pulling your legs up. The same thing applies to the ping pong ball side of the scale. The beaker filled with water can&#39;t make itself heavier by pulling a floating ping pong ball under the water.<br><br>So on the acrylic ball side we added weight of the water that was displaced by the acrylic ball, and on the ping pong ball side we added the weight of the ping pong ball. That makes the balance tip to the acrylic ball side. (I ignored the weight and buoyancy of the strings on both sides.)<br><br>Solution for the 2nd problem (spoiler alert I guess):<br>Now the left beaker isn&#39;t trying to make itself heavier any more. The force that is holding the ping pong ball submerged is an external one (you can&#39;t make yourself heavier by pushing yourself down, but someone else can make you heavier). So now both sides of the scale are heavier by the displaced amount of water. And since that displaced amount of water is the same (balls are of the same size), the answer is C. Balanced. Again I ignored the weight and buoyancy of the string, and I also ignored the fact that the water gets denser with increasing depth. If we don&#39;t ignore the string and the increased density, then the acrylic ball side is slightly heavier, but that&#39;s a story for another post.", "comment_date": "2015-04-16T09:12:44Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Manthan Sit", "comment_text": "B", "comment_date": "2015-04-16T09:06:22Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "RosGuys", "comment_text": "B: its simple, the more upward force the ping pong ball does, the more force (weight) you have to push down with your finguers, and its clearly bigger than the other because the ping pong ball is a lot less dense than the acrylic ball.

This is much easier to understand, the measured mass of the beaker increases by the mass of the ball that is added. As you add heavier balls, they will go from floating on the top (ball weight &lt; buoyancy force), to being suspended in the middle (ball weight = buoyancy force), to eventually sinking to the bottom (ball weight &gt; buoyancy force). The observed mass of the beaker increases by the mass of the ball in all three cases.<br><br>Scenario two is especially important to this explanation. Consider the increase in beaker weight during scenario two. It is equal to the weight of the suspended ball, which is equal to the buoyancy force.<br>Observed weight increase = buoyancy force of fully submerged ball.<br><br>Consider the first case, with the ping pong ball floating on the surface, supported by a buoyant force (ball weight &lt; buoyancy force of fully submerged ball). Consider the forces on the ping pong ball. The buoyant force pushes the ball upward. Now consider this force from the beaker&#39;s frame of reference. The equal and opposite reaction to the buoyant force propagates through the water, and acts downward on the beaker. The scales report that the weight of the beaker has increased with the addition of the ping pong ball. It has increased by the magnitude of the downward acting (from the beaker&#39;s perspective) buoyant force, which is equal to the weight of the ping pong ball.<br><br>When the ping pong ball is submerged and tied to the bottom, the buoyant force on the ball increases due to full submersion and increased water displacement volume. However, the beaker also counteracts this increased buoyant force via the tension in the string. Ultimately, the measured increase in beaker weight remains equal to the added mass of the ping pong ball and string, as in the simplified case with the floating ping pong ball (ball weight &lt; buoyant force).<br><br>Weight increase = weight ping pong<br>Weight ping pong &lt; buoyant force of fully submerged ball<br><b>Weight increase &lt; buoyant force of fully submerged ball</b><br><br><br><br>Now picture the third case, a heavy acrylic ball which sinks and rests on the bottom of the beaker (ball weight &gt; buoyant force). From the beaker&#39;s point of reference, there are two new downward acting forces with the addition of the ball. The first is the buoyant force, as in the previous example. The second is the contact force between the ball and the bottom of the beaker.\u00a0<br><br>Next we add the externally supported string to this scenario. The force that was previously transmitted to the beaker via contact with the ball, is now supported by the string. Only the buoyant force is now felt by the beaker. We have essentially transformed this from initial scenario three\u00a0(ball weight &gt; buoyant force, so ball sinks to bottom of beaker), to initial scenario two\u00a0(ball weight - string tension = buoyant force, so ball suspended in middle of beaker), thanks to the addition of an external force.<br><br>With the external string, the scale now measures an increase in weight equal to the buoyant force acting on the fully submerged acrylic ball.<br><b>Weight increase = buoyant force of fully submerged ball</b><br><br><br><br>The vectors in the video are quite good for visualising the above explanation.\u00a0If you are still reading, then well done. Bear with me, the verbal assault is nearby finished. It should become apparent that by pushing down on the ping-pong ball with an external force, we can also transform this scenario into initial case two (ball weight + Derek&#39;s finger = buoyant force, so ball suspended in middle of beaker).

For the second test, the ping pong ball should drop. Now hear me out: if his fingers are constanly trying to push down to counteract the water, doesnt that mean he may actually push the scale down. This is because the ping pong ball has equally balanced forces upon it, water pushing up, and gravity. Some people may think that his hand is also balanced, but that is only true if the ping pong ball is stationary. Since he was able to push the ball down, that means there was more downaward push than up. Now if you think about how he will do his experiment, he said that he will keep his fingers sumberged. Since we figured that there is more down push, that means the scale will go down. But this causes an issue. The beaker is going down due to gravity which leaves his fingers in the air. This springs the scale back up and then his fingers will apply pressure agaian. So there should theoretically be only two possibilities right now, one where the ping pong beaker goes down and one where they both balance. But in my opinion - purely from instinct - i think that the ping pong ball will fall.

In the previous set-up we already concluded that the downward force on the left and right side respectively was the weight of the water and the ping-pong ball and the weight of the water and the water displaced by the acrylic ball. As we don&#39;t change anything to the right set-up, this force stays the same. The left force can be &quot;reached&quot; as follows: using the previous set-up, remove the tether. The system of the left beaker is still an independent system, except for gravity, so the downward force is still the weight of the water and the ping-pong ball. Now, to keep the ball submerged, we need to push it downward with a force equal to the weight of the water displaced by the ping-pong ball. Therefore, this force is added to the left side. In conclusion, we have these total forces: left side: weight(water) + weight(ping-pong ball) + weight(displaced water by ping-pong ball) right side: weight(water) + weight(displaced water by acrylic ball) As the ping-pong ball and the acrylic ball have the same volume, after comparing, we see that the force on the left side is equal to the force on the right side with the weight of the ping-pong ball added to it. Considering weights are positive, the left force has to be greater than the right force, so the balance should tilt so that the left side lowers.<br><br>Then Vizaru chimed in and changed my mind:<br><br>This is very close to being correct, but you made one mistake.<br><br>&quot;to keep the ball submerged, we need to push it downward with a force<br>equal to the weight of the water displaced by the ping-pong ball.&quot;<br><br>Let us consider the ping-pong ball: It is stationary, so the sum of all forces on it is zero. The buoyant force pushes up on it. The weight of the ball pulls downward on it.

This side weighs: the weight of water, beaker, the ping pong ball and the string.<br>If you look at the system on the right, the ball is supported outside the system, so this side weighs the weight of beaker, the water, plus the balance of forces on the ball. The ball has two forces acting on it, the tension on the string (gravity pulling it down)\u00a0and the water pushing up (buoyancy), its kind of like if you tie yourself to a scale and submerge yourself in water slowly, the scale will show that your weight is going down slowly. Keeping that in mind and applying it here, the tension on the string goes down as the ball is submerged, (due to buoyancy) but the force is not enough to move the string so equal and opposite force is applied down, thus pushing the right side down. Another way of saying this is the for of buoyancy on the left side is canceled out by the tension but on the right side it is not.<br><br>So therefore, the extra force applied downwards in the right system will be equal to the loss of tension in the right string, which can be calculated and\u00a0even\u00a0measured,\u00a0remembering to subtract the weight of ping pong ball because as a closed system the left side does have an additional mass in it.\u00a0 Another way of saying this is the for of buoyancy on the left side is canceled out by the tension but on the right side it is not.<br><br>Based on this, if we try to submerge the ping pong ball we are applying a positive force down which will be equal to the buoyancy of the ball, which as I mentioned earlier is the main force pushing the right side down.

Several things going on here. I will analyse several different systems to illustrate what is going on.<br><br>From the point of view of the acrylic ball: The difference between the weight of the ball and the buoyant force will keep the string taut. Which is what we see in the previous experiment. This means that the weight of the acrylic ball exceeds the buoyant force.<br><br>From the point of view of the ping pong ball: We have the force of Derek&#39;s finger pushing the ball down so that it is just submerged, the weight of the ping pong ball also pushing it downward (the ping pong ball weighs much less than the acrylic however) and the buoyant force pushing the ball upward. If Derek does not push down on the ping pong ball then the ball would obviously float and only a small fraction of the ball would be submerged. When Derek&#39;s finger pushes down on the ping pong ball, he is essentially applying a force that compensates for the weight difference between the two balls.<br><br>To answer whether whether or not the balance is level or not we simply need to isolate a system that contains the ping pong ball&#39;s beaker and the water contained in it:<br><br>The weight of the glass and water is driving the system downward. The ping pong ball is also pushing the system downward.<br><br>Recall what I said about the ping pong ball. If the buoyant force of the ping pong ball is pushing the ball upwards then the ball is consequently pushing the water downwards to maintain balance (or else the ball would move, but it doesn&#39;t move because Derek is holding it in place with his finger).<br><br>Both balls have the same volume. Both balls displace the same amount of water so the the buoyant force for both balls is identical as long as the fluids in each beaker are the same. We can make the same argument for the acrylic ball&#39;s beaker as well.<br>and because both balls experience the same buoyant force, both balls push both beakers down with an equal force and the scales are balanced.<br><br>The outcome of the new experiment entirely depends on whether or not Derek submerges his fingers/hand into the beaker. If he does, more water is displaced and and generates more buoyant force to resist the ball and his hand. The reacting force as seen by the beaker and water will increase to balance things out and will push the scale downward further than the acrylic ball&#39;s beaker.

While ping-pong ball is mostly air, acrylic ball is solid, more dense so displace more weight of water. If this was in an Archimedes&#39; bathtub - acrylic ball would simply pour out the bigger mass and volume of water, than ping pong ball. And as for new conditions - that&#39;s where the thread tension will play leading role.

Since the ping-pong ball&#39;s buoyancy would no longer be counteracted by the upward tension on the string, the downward reaction force on the beaker would be equal to the buoyant force on the ball, meaning the downward force on both beakers would be identical. However, we need to consider other external forces. Looking at the balls individually, the ping-pong ball has downward forces (gravity and your fingers) counteracting the buoyant force. Gravity will pull down on the ping pong ball by its weight, buoyancy will push the ping-pong ball up by the weight of water displaced, so your fingers exert a force on the ball equal to (ball&#39;s weight) - (displaced water&#39;s weight). Since this force would be negative, if the system is the balls, beakers, water, and scale, that means you are exerting a downward force on the ping pong ball side. For the acrylic ball, there are also three forces: gravity, equal to the acrylic ball&#39;s weight, buoyancy, equal to the weight of the water displaced, and the string, which would exert a force equal to (ball&#39;s weight) - (displaced water&#39;s weight). This is the same combination of forces as for the ping-pong ball, but since the string&#39;s force would be positive, it would pull up on the acrylic ball&#39;s side of the scale. With an external downward force on the ping-pong ball side and an external upward force on the acrylic ball&#39;s side, the scale would tilt down towards the ping pong ball. I hope.

The liquid solid phase boundary in the phase diagram of water has a negative slope and this means that increase in pressure (at the same temperature) favours the conversion of ice to water. I have verified it by letting the gas out when it was still in liquid state and it froze instantly. I also shook a sealed bottle vigorously when it was frozen and sure enough, the ice started melting very fast. It took about a minute to melt the ice filling the entire bottle.<br><br>I&#39;m not sure if my hypothesis is actually right, but it seems to fit the observations I&#39;ve made so far.

Similarly when the left beaker moves up by one millimeter.<br><br>However, when the right beaker moves down one millimeter, some of the water has to flow around the stationary ball. Because of that, on average, the water particles in the right beaker move down by more than one millimeter. (Water above the ball is replaced by water below the ball, effectively &quot;skipping&quot; over the height of the ball.) Similarly when the right beaker moves up by one millimeter.<br><br>So when the scale moves the left beaker up by one millimeter, it lifts all the water in the left beaker by one millimeter, but at the same time the water in the beaker right moves down by more than one millimeter. This has the same effect as if the water in the right beaker would sit on a longer lever on a seesaw.<br><br>As far as we are concerned in this experiment, the weight of the two balls is not relevant. (The right ball could also be a ping pong ball that is simply pushed into the water with a stick instead of being supported by a rope. It just needs to be stationary object with respect to the scale, so the water moves around it when the beaker moves.)<br><br>So the relevant thing in this experiment is that the left ball moves with the beaker and the right one is stationary. When pushing down the ping-pong ball with your fingers you create the same situation on both sides: A stationary ball that does not move with the beaker. So the answer to the second question is C.<br><br>(Yes, this is just\u00a0buoyancy explained from basic principles. But in this situation I personally find it more intuitive to go back to basic principles.)", "comment_date": "2015-04-13T19:00:56Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "exaMAB", "comment_text": "C: the two systems are now equivalent.", "comment_date": "2015-04-13T19:00:53Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "aljowen", "comment_text": "C since the displacement is the same and the weight is supported externally on both sides.", "comment_date": "2015-04-13T19:00:46Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Lubo Ang", "comment_text": "C.
