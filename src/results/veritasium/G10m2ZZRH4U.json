As totality approached it did get cooler and darker but I was amazed at how much light was still there with just a sliver of the sun still showing. When the diamond ring (the phenomenon of just a small ball of light on one side of the sun) left and the eclipse went total, it was like all the light just got sucked back into the moon and then \u201cpoof\u201d, the corona just popped out at you. You could hear the collective gasps of the crowd in a meadow about 2/10ths of a mile away, then cheers broke out. Lasted for a couple of minutes then the sun popped back out.

The river was just outside the totality ring, and we were on the interstate on our way back home, well within the totality area, and missed it. Didn&#39;t help that he and I ate the mushrooms on the way there, so once we got in the water, we didn&#39;t make much headway. First time I&#39;d ever been in a canoe, I&#39;m literally twice the size of my cousin, and he decided I should be in front and let him steer. Even though, I&#39;d actually gotten into the back of the canoe, facing the right direction, he&#39;d got in the front, facing the wrong way. So, we rode backwards, with the heavy guy in front, facing the rear... And since, mushrooms... Took us a while to figure out this wasn&#39;t working. Then, dumped it a few times, even after we got going the right way. And I missed a perfect crane feather, propped up on a rock even with a beam of sunshine on it. Didn&#39;t see it til it was too late to get over to it, but I should&#39;ve just dove in and swam. It would&#39;ve been perfect to go with my eagle feather I&#39;d just received.

How is it so many atheistic people could respond to something so spiritually? Because the wonders of the universe scream to us that there is a God and we must take note. I hope many of them hooting and hollering were doing so in worship to God, but statistically speaking, probably not. The moon is roughly 1/400th the size of the sun and roughly 1/400th the distance from earth to the sun which is why we can have total solar eclipses. Not only that but it is the total solar eclipse which permitted us to study the chromosphere and corona and develop spectroscopy for finding out from studying other stars in the galaxy and universe that the sun is particularly special for us on earth and not at all average. The idea that the eclipse, the habitability of earth thanks to the sun/moon relationship, and the usefulness for discoverability could all be coincidences is beyond silly.<br>God is continually using His creation to get our attention to our need for Him and His desire to have that relationship.

Lol its  the dumbing down of the population sad to see . By the wag you  know what happened 99 years ago ? It was last time an eclipse     was seen in totality from somewhere in the USA  this was first time ever 5 totalitys in one day reason each totality lasted different amount of time was because there where  5 different size objects eclipsing the sun , those same 5 objects in  5 years will be on the other side of our sun heading awa y from the sun moving in the opposite direction , in 2017 the great American deception  they vwhere headed towards the sun , 5 years they  will, have orbited the sun and will be moving away , yku seem to be a smart guy use your head you got caught up in it without being logical .   Tge only place tgat sees totality when moon eclipses the sun  ,is where ever the shadiw is at tge monent tge moon blocks sun completely ,a little over 2 minutes after its over and moon keeps moving away from sun and will not move in front of it again . You cant change tge laws of physics especially if  not one person explained how could happen , this is a thing they do all the time now they say things without anything to back it up , and anyway since i was a kid they would  always show them to us at  school ,and always said only pl ace that will see totality is where reporter talking is and if your  watching it  live on tv every one else in shadows path will see partial , do you  homework its sad to see even smart people got fooled", "comment_date": "2019-05-23T12:56:36Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "JJ Beh", "comment_text": "Imagine being someone that\u2019s isolated from the rest of the world with no power and just inside in a total eclipse and thinking the sun went out and it was the end of the world", "comment_date": "2019-05-22T21:58:49Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Purplez", "comment_text": "I was on a plane when it happened", "comment_date": "2019-05-22T20:26:00Z", "likes_count": 2}, {"comment_by": "Florentine Nice", "comment_text": "I remember this!

Good job. Tell me,..why did the moon -&#39;decelerate&#39; into the center position and &#39;stay there&#39; for , uhh minutes?  And then,  uhh, accelerate out of the sun&#39;s  &#39;kind of corona&#39;? In 1986, I saw the same eclipse and it did not resemble this in the least. Also, in totality, where are the stars?  That sunrise in the east and the west you mentioned is the result of the relative brightness of the sun -giving way to the light of brown dwarf stellar objects(STARS)</del> in the inner solar system..maybe your channel can make the CONNECTION between Mike Brown&#39;s Inertial Plane for Planetary Precession (source of our tilt increase to 59deg to the North in late April),  52 inches of rain in Houston  during Harvey in one day as the result of the &#39;Fission Cascade&#39; occurring  as  the sun&#39;s plasma collides with a  &#39;helium based plasma coming in from our rear from a brown dwarf, which is heating our troposphere and the oceans leading to mass evaporation and fantastic epic floods .

I was far from being prepared for this, but tried to use my\u00a0GoPro on a tripod and my cheap Fuji camera , knowing I was ill equipped \u00a0the plan was to just observe it for the most part. I did however have a pair of real nice Minox high grade 10X binoculars to view through\u00a0during totality and I gotta tell you\u00a0it exceeded my expectations big time, it\u00a0was incredible\u00a0especially the diamond ring and\u00a0the view through my binos I could see the flames or the sun&#39;s\u00a0prominences\u00a0\u00a0to be exact knowing that they were bigger than Jupiter and the earth put to geather. As it phased out I saw the Bailey&#39;s beads through the binos, but only briefly since I didn&#39;t want to take any chance to damage my eyes, then it was back to using the safety glasses. It is something I think everyone half interested in science or spirituality should take the time to go see\u00a0because it evokes a inner emotion that is hard to describe. My only complaints were it didn&#39;t last very long and the mass exodus of traffic out of there back to Pocatello was exhausting.... otherwise\u00a0just the\u00a0chance to see it with my son\u00a0was a definitely a\u00a0defining moment I&#39;ll never forget.\u00a0The path of totality is the way to go or you miss what is coined\u00a0a total eclipse.\u00a0If you\u00a0missed this one\u00a0make plans to see the next one\u00a02024\u00a0 you wont regret it.", "comment_date": "2017-08-27T17:52:24Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Lee Gibson", "comment_text": "Only an American could ruin the spectacle of a solar eclipse by failing to not flap their jaws to talk utter drivel for five minutes.", "comment_date": "2017-08-27T17:23:30Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Shrimoy Roy", "comment_text": "I envy you more than my crush&#39;s crush -.-", "comment_date": "2017-08-27T16:59:58Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "\uae40\ud0dc\uade0", "comment_text": "Wow  I want there", "comment_date": "2017-08-27T15:55:51Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "lecisko", "comment_text": "<b>clap</b> <b>clap</b> woohooo oh my god oh my god oh my god oh my woohooo <b>clap</b>", "comment_date": "2017-08-27T15:53:14Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "M M", "comment_text": "Awesome video.

If it was <br>in front of you, and I ask you, &#39;Who is the best person that can tell <br>you the mechanisms of this machinery?&#39; The common reply would be &#39;the <br>manufacturer&#39;, or &#39;the creator&#39;, or &#39;the inventor&#39;, or &#39;the producer&#39;. <br>Whatever the reply would be, it would all be similar.<br><br>Now I ask you, &#39;How did our universe come into existence?&#39; A common <br>answer would be that initially there was a singularity point, then there<br> was the Big Bang, then a secondary separation which gave rise to <br>galaxies and eventually the sun, the moon and the earth on which we <br>live. Science calls this the Big Bang Theory and only came to know of <br>this theory recently, just a few decades ago. This is already mentioned <br>in the Quran over 1400 years ago in Surah Anbiya, chapter 21, verse 30, <br>&quot;Have those who disbelieved not considered that the heavens and the <br>earth were a joined entity, and We separated them...&quot; Who could have <br>known this?<br><br>If you are asked, &#39;Is the light of the moon its own light or reflected <br>light?&#39;, you would say that previously it was thought that the moon <br>produced its own light but recently science has discovered that the <br>light of the moon is not its own light but reflected light. The Qur&#39;an <br>mentions over 1400 years ago in Surah Furqan, chapter 25, verse 61 <br>&quot;Blessed is He who has placed in the sky great stars and placed therein a<br> [burning] lamp and luminous moon&quot;. The Arabic word used for moonlight <br>in the Qur&#39;an is &quot;muneer&quot; or &quot;noor&quot; meaning reflected light or borrowed <br>light. Who could have mentioned this 1400 years ago?<br><br>The world that we live on, what&#39;s the shape of this earth on which we <br>live? The common answer would be &#39;it is spherical&#39;. When did we come to <br>know this for sure? The answer would be &#39;It was in the 16th century when<br> the Magellan-Elcano expedition&#39;s circumnavigation of Earth proved it to<br> be spherical. But the Quran tells us over 1400 years ago, in Surah <br>Naziat, chapter 79, verse 30, &quot;And after that He spread the earth.&quot; The <br>Arabic word at the end of this verse, &#39;Dahahaa&#39;, one of its meanings is <br>&#39;the earth as an expanse&#39; whilst the other Arabic word which it derives <br>from refers to an ostrich egg. Science tells us that earth is ellipsoid <br>in shape and if you analyse the shape of an ostridge egg, that too is an<br> ellipsoid in shape. Who could have mentioned over 1400 years ago that <br>the shape of the earth is an ellipsoid?<br><br>Today, science tells us that the universe is expanding, which is <br>mentioned in the Quran over 1400 years ago in Surah Dhariyat , chapter <br>51, verse 47, &quot;With power did We construct the heaven. Verily, We are <br>Able to extend the vastness of space thereof.&quot;<br><br>Today we have come to know about the 2 seas with different types of <br>water, sweet and salty, and there is a barrier between them. This is <br>mentioned in the Quran in Surah Furqan, chapter 25, verse 53 and Surah <br>Rahman Chapter 55 verse 17-18. &quot;And it is He Who has let free the two <br>seas [kinds of water]: this is palatable and sweet, and that is salt and<br> bitter, and He has set a barrier and a complete partition between <br>them.&quot; &quot;He has let loose the two seas [the salt and fresh water] meeting<br> together. Between them is a barrier which none of them can transgress.&quot;<br> Who could have known this over 1400 years ago in the Arabian desert?<br><br>Today science tells us it is the mountains that prevents the earth from <br>shaking which is mentioned in the Quran over 1400 years ago in Surah <br>Naba, chapter 78, verses 6-7.<br><br>The Quran speaks of biology that &quot;We have created every living creature <br>from water&quot;, in Surah Anbiya, chapter 21, verse 30. The Quran mentions <br>this over 1400 years ago.<br><br>The Quran speaks of zoology, about the lifestyle of the spider in Surah <br>Ankaboot, chapter 29, verse 41, about the ant in Surah Naml chapter 27, <br>verse 17-18, about the bee in Surah Nahl, chapter 16, verse 66,68-69.<br><br>The Quran speaks of embryology in Surah Alaq, ch 96, verses 1-2. &quot;We <br>have created the humans from alaqah, a leech like substance.&quot;<br><br>The Quran speaks of embryological stages in Surah Muminoon, chapter 23, <br>verse 12-14. <br><br><br>We can go on and on talking about the scientific points, there are more <br>than 1000 verses in the Quran which speaks about science. After all <br>these scientific facts, I ask you, Who could have mentioned that in the <br>Quran? The only reply you can give you is the creator, the manufacturer,<br> the inventor, the producer. This creator, this manufacturer, this <br>producer, this inventor, we Muslims know him as Allah, the Almighty God.", "comment_date": "2017-08-25T16:33:02Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Julian Behnen", "comment_text": "Go check out SmarterEveryDay, they made a video of the ISS passing the sun...", "comment_date": "2017-08-25T16:14:00Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "wolfgang schmittenhammer", "comment_text": "THANKS!!!!

There&#39;s no way to document this experience fully. It&#39;s a complete sensory experience of overwhelming proportions. It starts with the light getting weaker and sharper and wan like it&#39;s coming through a thicker and thicker filter, the lights coming through the gaps in tree leaves took on upside-down crescent shapes. It&#39;s not like the light in evening at all. The colors around got somehow more intense but muted at the same time and it was so eerie and uncanny. The birds started singing evening songs, the flowers began to close. The temperature dropped significantly and dew was forming on every still surface right before our very eyes. The air smells different, it almost tastes different, and as the light got weaker and weaker, stars and planets became visible. The sky had a glow at the horizon where the edge of the moon&#39;s shadow hit. The birds went silent, then a great roar and cheer of distant people rose into the air. And then the last drop of sunlight turned into that brilliant diamond ring, and we were in twilight. The moon covering the sun is the weirdest feeling, and the sight is incapable of reproduction on even the best cameras. The corona is like these silvery, whispy petals extending from this dark orb, and because we were on the edge of totality, right around the silhouette of the moon we could see hot pink beads of the prominences and chromosphere the whole time. I could have never imagined what it was like.

For those in the US, if you couldnt travel to see the 1979 one and you couldn&#39;t go to Hawaii for the 1991 eclipse, this might be the only eclipse you got to see. i hope everyone that saw this year&#39;s will be able to experience this amazing event again, but many people wont be able to.<br><br>i do also agree a total solar eclipse can be stunning in eerie silence, so if really bothers you if people cheer, the best idea would be to go somewhere alone or just with your group, not to a viewing party or site. that way you&#39;ll get the most out of the eclipse. this is probably coming from those who aren&#39;t seeing their first eclipse, so all i can say is remember your first eclipse and how it made you feel. don&#39;t shut someone down who&#39;s seeing it for the first time because its such a great experience and people should be excited and happy.<br><br>lastly, we&#39;re not &quot;cheering the moon on&quot; like a soccer game, we&#39;re cheering because of how incredible it is that we get to be here with the people we love, experiencing the universe happening around us. totality is like nothing else. no perfect camera or any expert storyteller can even come close to describing what it feels like to be standing there under the total eclipse. and when you realize all of this, you cant help but cheer. you&#39;re cheering because you&#39;re alive and you either made it out here to see the eclipse or fate decided to put you in the path of totality. you&#39;re cheering because of how truly magnificent the universe is. you&#39;re cheering because no matter what, the world keeps going on around you and something inside of you is different when you come out of totality then when you went in. people cant help but celebrate something so amazing.", "comment_date": "2017-08-22T14:51:31Z", "likes_count": 191}, {"comment_by": "JayDragoni", "comment_text": "Mind if I use some clips from this in my video?

If you have not heard of the term &#39;the overview effect&#39; I would highly recommend reading a bit about it. This is a radical spiritual and psychological shift in understanding, that is usually as result of viewing earth it from outer space. In one single glance astronauts, view the earth in its entirety, without borders or boundaries, without flags or racial segregation, there is only earth. Astronaut, Ron Garan said, \u2018As I looked back at our Earth from orbital perspective I saw a world where natural and man-made boundaries disappeared\u201d. Sultan Bin Salman al~Saud said \u201cThe first day or so we all pointed to our countries. The third or fourth day we were pointing to our continents. By the fifth day, we were aware of only Earth\u201d. David Bever, co-founder of The Overview Institute said \u2018We have been evolving from the beginning of civilization to a larger and larger perspective of life\u201d. Many can experience this effect from on the ground while observing a celestial event such as a total solar eclipse. Calling a country out based on how they react to this expirence is in direct opposition to how this has made me feel today.

He has a great mind capable of true originality and yet I sense from him so often that he is not telling his own story, that his words are so often placed in his mouth by another mind, and worse than that his thoughts are placed in his mind by other peoples&#39; minds. He is sick with something, but he will refuse to break away from these minds that hold him captive, he is too logical for that, his mind forbids it. There is something else that makes him unhappy, he is looking for something, he doesn&#39;t know what, he feels lost and almost depressed because he has been looking for a long time. You practically told me all of this as do many people, they tell me their secrets in the deepest corner of their heart never guessing that there is a soul on earth is empathetic enough to simply listen to them. I dearly hope you get better, your situation is a hard one to be in, on the one hand, you feel your duty as a scientist to learn from your betters, on the other you have suppressed your childish nature you tell me so much about. Isn&#39;t much of it out of laziness on your part? It is hard work to strike out on your own with what limited cleverness that you have, learning from your betters beats learning by yourself any day. You are afraid, afraid of disappointing yourself and the world, you wish to shake this fear off and live happily in your childlike curiosity with no one to judge you that is why you came to YouTube, but even here it is evident that you are brainwashed, part of you likes it and the other wishes to be free. <br><br>Please don&#39;t try to kill me. I have had people before who have tried and people who have wanted to but were too civilized. They are angry and hate me because I touch things they want secret, locked in their hearts forever and ever, then (sometimes) they say with tears streaming down their face looking like they want to bite my face off &quot;How do you know?&quot; and I always tell them &quot;You told me.&quot; If you are angry with me (which you probably will be for a time) I don&#39;t mind if you tell me, then you will calm down and do what you feel is right towards me. Even the most reasonable people can be quite savage. I was taken aback by it at first but then learned that whenever you expose someone for who they truly are along with their flaws they feel like killing you. I had my head shoved into icy snow once, and then sat upon and kicked mercilessly. It is a consolation to them, shouting and screaming as they do.

I was surprised how light the darkness was though, and surprised by seeing Venus (people said it was Jupiter) not far away just like you saw. And at the end, everyone&#39;s reaction was the same seeing the first bright spot, and then it increased in brightness <i>fast</i> ! In Gallatin it lasted 2 minutes and 40 seconds, and I wished it had gone on much longer.
