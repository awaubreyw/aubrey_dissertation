Sure: anecdotal stories are popular and spreading quick and communicate better. Scientific methods and conclusion hardly can gain that kind of popularity. Let me rephrase this statement with a different metaphor: for an average human being reading Cinderella is much easier and more entertaining than reading even a one page publication from Bohr about spinning electrons. The majority of humans are neither have the brain capacity to deal with Bohr, nor the interest, or just they are trying to pay their mortgages or survive. It is not a big surprise that easy to understand populist stories trumps over dry data. Same applies to music. It is easier to listen a pop (popular) music, then really pay attention to Rachmaninoff. So to the question: why anecdotes trump data? Because one is easy and interesting, the other is boring and tedious? Does it mean that an easy read brings more value to society? Soap operas are easy to watch and sadly it is extremely popular. It is not hard to watch 8 seasons of an entertaining show and people do that instead of spending fraction of that time with any mental work (just thinking about another Veritasium video about &quot;Gun&quot; and &quot;Drew&quot;). Yes, sometimes anecdotes trump data, but it is bad. Why scientific results need to go through on a populist pass? Was any populist voting about how to build a mobile phone, launch a rocket, build a building or anything? No. Because the majority has and should not have word on it. Because they do not know. It is not their job. For many serious breakthrough results we should do our best to either: avoid the need for a populist pass or create an entertaining story, which explains it to a 5 years old. My last metaphor: anecdotes are equivalent to a one page marketing material of a product. Data is the backend. One is not competing with the other, but support each other. The user can only read a one pager marketing brochure and make a buying decision and use the product. The backend or engineering will make it useful or not. So my conclusion: we cannot compare anecdotes with data. We need both for success (just because of the consumerism, but that is a separate big topic why the hack we even need anecdotes for things should be supported only by data).", "comment_date": "2021-11-06T20:27:52Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Speedy Checkmate", "comment_text": "100 agree...it is an entertainment media, not an informational one.

I&#39;d hypothesize that the majority of mainstream, tax funded,  scientific research doesn&#39;t live up to the standards of C+ third grade science fair projects.   And then there&#39;s the Jeff Goldblume Character from Jurassic Park question that most &quot;Scientist&quot; have no way of answering.&quot; Your scientists were so preoccupied with whether or not they could, they didn\u2019t stop to think if they should.&quot; So much of science has absolutely no positive end effect on humanity in any possible way.  Elon Musk wants to build a city on Mars, 237 million space miles away. A planet that every single element of human survival must take a months long rocket ride costing multiples of millions. But over 2000 children die every single day from Dhiarea.  The root cause being,  humanity is incapable of providing clean, safe drinking water to poor nation&#39;s. We live on a Planet that is 2/3 covered in Water.  But we can&#39;t figure out how to prevent 2000 children from death every day.  Why is Science not working on this? No there busy working for Elon and doing important Science.  Yeah.  Why of all the PBS Nova episodes that they have shot about Paleontologist and Dinosaur bone hunters that get really excited to talk about how big dinosaurs were, never talk about how no paleontologists have ever done anything that pushes the human race forward or gained any knowledge about anything.  Jeff Goldblumes character in Jurassic Park was the only thing good to ever come from studying dinosaurs.   Quantum Physics, CERN and the Hydron Particle Collider and SETI, and theoretical Astro Physics all useless, pointless and 99% un testable theory.  Every NASA Photo of some Deep space Quazar that looks like it was painted by Rembrandt, is really the results of the most expensive Instagram photo filtering tech your tax money can buy. Humanities entire space research after Sputnik. Pointless.  Satelites have been beneficial to communication.  My point/rant is that, so so much of science is of no use or consequence.  I love knowledge and I admire anyone who wants to learn something new.  Science is the best way to do that.  But studying what the Shitheadosaurus may or may not have eaten while in heat and pregnant, is not only not science. Its an unethical waste of finite resources to teach and fund it as Science, when Science could and should be studying, with the Scientific method, and solving some of humanities simplest and most urgent existential crisis.

Contrary to appearances, there&#39;re are a lot of rules pertaining how to write junk mail. These rules come from years of testing and subjecting written appeals (or the results of the appeals) to the scrutiny of the scientific method. So, if you get a letter from, say, Save the Ducks Foundation, and it&#39;s written as poorly as a 6th grader&#39;s diary (that is, it&#39;s pathos-driven and written at a 6th grade reading level-<del>all its words are shorter than two syllables; it lacks coherent structure; its points seem random, unconnected to one another, and haphazardly placed; half the sentences end with exclamation points; and there&#39;s an excess of bold, underlined, italicized, and all-caps words), it&#39;s deliberate. In this line of work, stupid brings in the money. Ugly looking letters have better returns. Anyway, one of the most important rules--and it has two parts-</del> is DON&#39;T use numbers, stats, charts because people tune out the second they see data. Instead, tell a story. Look at your junk mail next time it comes, instead of chucking it--which is what practically everyone does (myself included). If the writer knows what he or she is doing, the letter should start off with an anecdote, a story. (Also notice that the &quot;hard ask;&quot; that is, when they ask you to make a donation of X, or X, or X and so on, is located roughly 3/4 of the way down on the first page. One the second page you&#39;ll find a post-script at the bottom (P.S.) In an effective letter, the PS will have another &quot;ask.&quot; Of the 2% of people who actually open their junk mail, the majority will immediately turn to the last page and look for a signature.  In most cases, their eyes will move down to the PS, and the PS will actually be the first thing they read. It&#39;s all so calculated. My point--which I&#39;m wandering around--is that people want to hear stories. The way to the heart is through stories. The scientists who are engaged in trying to convince climate-change deniers that we&#39;ve got a legitimate problem need to revise their approach (I think they&#39;re catching on) and convey data indirectly through narrative!

They compared the means of scores between 10 men and 10 women and since the average score of the women was higher, they said myth confirmed. However, this isn&#39;t appropriate, especially considering that I ran a paired t-test, the appropriate statistical technique for handling such data, and the means were NOT different to a statistically significant level. In any other study, that lack of statistical significance might AT BEST have claimed the results were indicative. So they should have said myth plausible, not confirmed. Mythbusters isn&#39;t just not using statistics, but when they do, they&#39;re using them incorrectly. This is an issue for performing scientific experiments properly.

First it was the coming &quot;ice age&quot; (1970s). Then it was &quot;global warming&quot; (1980s - 1990s).  Now it&#39;s a tidy blend called, &quot;climate change.&quot;  Meanwhile, the myth of &quot;global warming&quot; continues to be told while year after year the data shows it&#39;s not just &quot;one cold, snowy winter.&quot;  The &quot;climate change&quot; canard was supposed to explain why hurricane Katrina was A) So strong, and B) a harbinger of what was to come.  Supposedly, &quot;climate change&quot; was going to be the explanation for the coming onslaught of &quot;category 5&quot; disasters - entire coastlines would be wiped out.  Yet, instead it&#39;s been the quietest stretch of hurricanes since data&#39;s been kept that tracks number, strength, and severity of damage.

Because even the intensity of light difference between shade and sunny is so great, that you move into the sunlight to get warm. The sun has a enormous influence on our temperature here on Earth.

The climate has been changing well before the Industrial Revolution. CO^2 accounts for a very small percentage of the atmosphere anyway. Also, there are plenty of other factors that contribute that have nothing to do with human activity; solar activity, shape and size of Earth&#39;s elliptical orbit around the sun, tilt in the Earth&#39;s axis, etc. Also, during the past few decades, we&#39;ve seen about 1/3 of all CO^2 emissions produced in all of human history. Yet at the same time there has been no net warming trend. The climate\u00a0does change. No one denies that. However, humans are not the cause of it. I think there might also be a bit more distrust in scientists, at least from my perspective. I became a Christian through the Creation vs. Evolution debates. For a time I stopped trusting in scientists all together because I couldn&#39;t believe the accepted just a ridiculous idea as Evolution. Later, I learned that this and a few other specific errors don&#39;t negate the plethora of true scientific fact. However, I&#39;ve still always held on to a bit more\u00a0skepticism in the scientific community. Nearly half of Americans accept Creation over Evolution. What would you think their opinion of the vast majority of scientists accepting Evolution would be? Personally, I hold more skepticism in them than I used to. I used to think scientists were always the smartest people in the world and whatever they said must be true because they said it. Much of that blind faith in scientists has been destroyed. I still love true science and even decided to major in Aerospace Engineering (STEM major). I can accept science regarding things like Aeronautics. However, if a scientist says anything that I see as even remotely controversial I start questioning them and am not afraid to reject something I deem to be false.

The conclusions they make aren&#39;t supported by a background of &quot;good&quot; science (scare quotes because I don&#39;t want to say that MB science is &quot;bad,&quot; per se, just that it doesn&#39;t do the boring, repetitive stuff that characterizes our best science) so they can&#39;t claim to be educating people about established facts.

So relying on anecdotes there may give a false impression of what good science is.<br><br>And... I&#39;m kind of ok with that. I grew up with MB, and it&#39;s one of the things that fostered my love of science today.

A budding musician may be inspired by the apparently glamorous lifestyle of a rock star, not realizing the hard work and difficulties that go into making music, but that dramatic impression still motivates them to start a band with their friends and study instruments.

But science world aside, you have to FACTOR IN the truth that climate change is political just as much as it is scientific, therefore the very real element of lies and deceit exist within the range of support/other-than-support.  This is true for any political push.  You would bring more people to the table if you would acknowledge the nasty and unscientific element of human nature and the thirst for power that keeps getting ignored.  It certainly exists within this subject.  <br><br>Don&#39;t worry as I understand how a science presenter like yourself wouldn&#39;t want to touch a the political involvement here. People start getting nasty and ignorant when politics enters the conversation.  But because of the link to politics there will always be a sliver of skepticism, this goes with any subject that includes and political element.  I am not a denier, I am a realist.

I think what people want is something on their level they can understand, an emotional story is easy to understand, but only slightly more difficult is the cause/effect relationships chain. Not only is it easier to remember things once you understand the function, it gives you confidence in its validity. You see a magic trick, it seams impossible, you&#39;re told how the magic trick works, you immediately believe that is how its done because it (usually) is obvious once you understand the functions, science is more or less of a mystery depending on the person. <br><br>The fact that lots of people drink the larvacide is bad data for an explanation, people are concerned for their health over their lifetimes and many negative effects aren&#39;t so acute.

However, for cheaper experiments or ones where you do actually repeat them but don&#39;t add them in the episode, all you have to do is say &quot;in addition to this result, I/we re-performed the same experiment x number of times and achieved the same result&quot;. That wouldn&#39;t be satisfactory for publishing an article in a journal but it shows that you actually did do more than the bare minimum and I think would better inform those who don&#39;t already know how science works.", "comment_date": "2016-03-25T01:41:56Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "John Rogers", "comment_text": "Thanks for the walk", "comment_date": "2016-03-25T01:19:42Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "myowntubeusername", "comment_text": "Mythbusters usually tested if something was possible.

Listen!&quot; And sure enough, we all of a sudden heard what sounded like a seal barking. A seal in pain. All of a sudden everyone stopped, as our attention turned to what this guy was saying. It was like we were all zombies, slowly snapping out of it. Finally some one walked over to the stall, and peered over the top. He said, some guy was on the floor, apparently having a seizure. So now we started asking each other what to do. Someone tried to open the stall, but it was locked. So the guy who got our attention, crawled underneath, and opened the door. And sure enough, this guy was on the floor, barking like a seal, and spasming. His pants were pulled down around his ankles. &quot;What should we do?&quot; No one knew. But then I remembered Frankie And Johnny, so said, &quot;Turn him on his side, so he can breath.&quot; So that&#39;s what we did. Eventually, he stopped barking and spasming. I was astonished by how long this seizure had lasted. It seemed to have gone on forever. My next suggestion, was to pull his pants up, and sit him upright on the toilet. Only the guy who drew our attention joined in. It was at that point, we discovered he was a theater employee. So someone left to let them know out front. Meanwhile, this guy was not coming around. He was still out like light. His eyes were partway open, but no one was home. Eventually someone else helped prop him up, and I left.

My issue with mythbusters is their experiements are often just very flawed and overlook huge problems in methodology to make the reuslt accurate. <br><br>like the experiment you decribed, the way the experiment is conducted is crucial in what conclusions you can make from it. The way it is conducted can prime a perticular response, as with a lot of psychological experiments involving how people act. This is usualy completely absent issue from experiments that don&#39;t test human bahaviour, yet it&#39;s a similar issue, the people creating the experiment need to design it well otherwise your conclusions can&#39;t be as sound and you would then have to rely on repeating the experiment over and over. The epxeriment you descirbed sounded like it had a lot of iussues with priming, showing people a vidoe where some people heped and then videos of nice people, they have been primed by the first part of the experiemnt to give a perticular response in the second part. It doesn&#39;t sound like anything was done to take account of that and so you can only really conclude that when people are told that some people helped and shown two nice people then you can assume that their response is entirely based on their perspective rather than the specific way the experiment was conducted.  you could then repeat this experiment, have the same result and come to the same conclusion but that conclusion may be ignoring the big problems in the method of the experiment. <br><br>stats are great, but i think a more apt description of what you are trying to say with a story being more relatable is that you can show someone statistics, but they have no idea where they came from, how accurate they are, they may even be just made up. they usualy have zero context like that to make them trustable to most people.", "comment_date": "2016-03-23T16:07:35Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Omicron Vega", "comment_text": "Not a huge fan of your walking videos.
