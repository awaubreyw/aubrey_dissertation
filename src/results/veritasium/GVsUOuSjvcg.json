First, there was Analog amplifiers (aka tube amps) which even nowadays, after 60 years, they&#39;re still regarded as the best and most special amps, and they are the weapon of choice for the guitarists who want the most pure and raw sound possible because these amps react very organically and dynamically and give a sense of &quot;warmth&quot; to the guitar sound, but they come at the cost of very high price tags, may have some minor maintenance/reliability issues, and require tube replacements occasionally that can get expensive in the long run. Now, those who prefer something really reliable and practical opt for Transistor amplifiers (aka digital amps) which are way cheaper than tube amps, can also sound absolutely awesome when dialed in correctly, but in exchange lose a little of that magic &quot;warm reaction&quot; factor. Finally, through the last decade, it&#39;s Modelers (aka amp sims) that have been gaining the most popularity, mainly because of the modern advancements in the IR (Impulse Response) area. They&#39;re not exactly amplifiers, but instead more like programs, that can get the best out of the two worlds - Analog and Digital, by keeping at least some of that good old tube &quot;warmth&quot; through a good IR that can simulate how a speaker reacts to a particular amp&#39;s output, while also maintaining the reliability, practicality and affordable price ranges of the Digital stuff. Personally, I&#39;m a Tube amp guitarist because I like the &quot;full tone&quot; experience, I want my sound to be &quot;real&quot; for lack of a better word, but I use Modelers all the time too when recording at home, for their digital ease-of-use and simplicity, while still getting awesome tones, that can somewhat simulate a pretty cool analog reaction.

Digital computers essentially began during WW2 (in the USA for ballistic calculations; in Germany for airplane stress calculations) and took off in late 1950&#39;s due to accounting, stock control and other business application development.

It&#39;s not a case that to add 2 numbers in digital you need 50 transistors and for analogue you just need a wire connection as he claimed.

He was killed on the cross as payment for the sins of all mankind, three days later He rose from the dead. Forty days later He ascended into heaven where He sits at the right hand of the Father.

But when his disciples saw it, they had indignation, saying, To what purpose is this waste? For this ointment might have been sold for much, and given to the poor. When Jesus understood it, he said unto them, Why trouble ye the woman? for she hath wrought a good work upon me. For ye have the poor always with you; but me ye have not always. For in that she hath poured this ointment on my body, she did it for my burial. Verily I say unto you, Wheresoever this gospel shall be preached in the whole world, there shall also this, that this woman hath done, be told for a memorial of her. - Matthew 26:6-13<br><br>Seek ye the LORD while he may be found, call ye upon him while he is near: Let the wicked forsake his way, and the unrighteous man his thoughts: and let him return unto the LORD, and he will have mercy upon him; and to our God, for he will abundantly pardon.<br><br>To anoint your self, the sick, or a building for spiritual protection:<br>Get a small bottle of olive oil and pour off a small amount into a smaller vessel like a vial or baby food jar.

You listed more&#39;s law as the end all be all for power of computer and as we shrink we will eventually hit a problem. Quantum tunneling. Thats the issue. The electron will pass through a closed gate when its not supposed to be able to. <br><br>However this does not mean we are or are nearing the end for digital computers. We are still plenty far away from this. Die shrinking may be done soon, sure. But that doesn&#39;t spell the end for digital at all. 3d die stacking. You can build up. Combine 3d die stacking with 3d cache and you get a much stronger computer. <br><br>Then there is big.LITTLE for power savings. We don&#39;t always need the best of the best for everyday tasks. Why have an insane cpu running at its best 100% when you can have weaker cores for mundane tasks like word processing, web browsing. And the stronger cores for more heavy lifting stuff like gaming, engineer, rendering, computational etc.<br><br>Not to mention quantum computers. Granted with quantum computers computers we are probably in the eniac days comparative since they are insanely big and require a lot of conditions to work. Take it with digital and you got more life out of digital. <br><br>And at best i am going to say analog chips will be at best used on pcie cards for specific tasks or in conjunction with the main cpu. I doubt they would replace the digital. <br><br>So while i get the attractiveness of his analog chip it still needs to work with a digital chip to fix it errors. So again digital is not going anywhere. At best analog chips will get inter-grated on the cpu die (closer together means less energy used) and could very well run like big.LITTLE. Or at worst they will be expansion cards to help things much like how a gpu works. Analog will not replace digital anytime soon.<br><br>EDIT: Forgot to mention we can also change materials to allow further shrinkage which will allow moore&#39;s law to continue. Graphine and Gallium Nitride are two excellent alternatives for silicon and will allow much more transistors on a given area. And then if we again come to the point where quantum tunneling starts happening again ie reach the limit then either at this time a newer material might be available or we can always go back to 3d stacking. <br><br>So eh... i have issues with you saying the future is analog.

I already imaging that Mythic chip installed in GPU, helping Raytracing or AI based operation on digital software. Ray Tracing is very heavy compute due the gpu need to calculate a lot of light path in a scene, in a single frame, and don&#39;t forget, it also must calculate the light intensity, radiation value of light source, the light angle, and many more. As I know, there is more efficient algorithm too solve those complex light tracing path, but still it&#39;s a heavy compute on our GPU, so much so NVIDA &amp; AMD must built dedicated ray-trace processor inside their GPU to handle this.<br><br>Now, in analog computing, with less power, somehow they can perform that ray tracing path more efficiently, so the GPU just use the result from that calculation to display the result. This approach can be done, because if you remember back in the day, game that develop with physic feature like destructible object or surface, or real time cloth/hair simulation, is done on co-card just for that physic calculation. Even back in the day, Intel CPU can perform better if you install their co-math processor. So If Mythic chip is can be use in place just like that, we can have any GPU that can do ray tracing &amp; physic calculation with much more lower power consumption.<br><br>The application with GPU not just for ray-tracing, it can be use for AI based image upscaling, Object detection, vector calculation, and many more... allowing better visual in game and many design software.

Digital IS the optimal way to PROCESS information at a general level. Analog is the optimal way to COMPUTE information at a specialization level. Our brains are digital systems in that they process 1s and 0s through activation of neurons and synapses at insane scales and simultaneity. But, BUT, each neuron, despite being connected into a vast network that makes up the brain, IS an analog system. It&#39;s just that, over billions of years, evolution has figured out the optimal way where both can simultaneously coexist and are co-applied to handle a variety of tasks with bandwidth and latency that has not yet been produced by digital OR analog systems independently or as one. We are getting there though, bit by bit. We also have to recognize that the brain is not the only computational system in the body. Our nervous system extends to all our extremities and into all our organs, and trauma of any kind (minor or major) is felt instantly from the point of contact back to centers in the brain where it is processed. So you have a staggering number of analog activation behavior that runs up and down all those channels, but where its processed both at origination and into memory.<br><br>When you put your hand or finger near a hot flame, you feel that temperature differential and if you keep it there long enough, it hurts; a lot. This would mean that the nerves in your finger, thereby neurons, are being activated there and you feel the pain. This information called pain, is translated up the nervous system into the brain where its stored into memory. Factor in our senses, and our ability to learn (NN training essentially), that information is processed and stored into short and long-term memory. Thus, the next time we see a heated source, we know that we shouldn&#39;t put our hand or finger near it for too long and not on it at all. Of course, there&#39;s cases where despite the risks, we do it anyway; because we have moral or ethical imperatives that are driving us--like we want to save or protect someone or something, so we&#39;ll disregard the risk and pain, and injure ourselves to achieve that goal. But that&#39;s getting into a different line of thinking not specific to this. Ultimately though, there&#39;s a bit of commonality here in this example to Octopuses, in that they too have a distributed nervous system and where their ability to &quot;think&quot; exists beyond the central brain.<br><br>To that end, I think it would be fair to say that we, like them, also have that ability to do the same, and over the course of time and have done similarly. We use our hands and feet to progress civilization to great lengths. Our dexterity is essentially a form of distributed computing where each finger and muscle actuation to manipulate or propagate something we want or want to do. All that is a composition of analog systems that ultimately are centralizing into a digital processor, whose primary purpose is to store useful information into memory and discard the rest.<br><br>I should end things here or else I&#39;ll digress too far.

If it involves a singular application, the analog solution, which must be designed and precisely machined can cost thousands to millions of dollars.  A World War II firing control computer, for example, would today cost millions of dollars each, and had to be updated with new cams every time a new shell with different ballistics came out.  IIRC, they developed a parametric approach involving a series of dial-in correction factors which accommodated new shells.  However, digital firing control computers can be updated via software, a usually performed by a visit from the supporting contractor, but which probably could be accomplished in a pinch by military fire control technicians themselves.  <br><br>Then again, a general ballistics program with maneuverable shells renders the issue moot, except for the fact that modern electronics are both light and sturdy enough to handle the the 100s of Gs involved in the firing process while using EMP and EW hardened electro-optical viewing and target tracking systems to home in on the target.  Example:  The Javelin missile system*, light enough to be carried long distances by one person, with a reusable launcher that doubles as an IR scope, and capable of taking out tanks at a distance.  <br><br>Let&#39;s see you do that with an analog computer!<br><br>*I&#39;m sure there exist many non-military applications, including the electronic ignition, emissions control, and gas mileage optimization circuits in my truck; the electronic temperature control and energy optimization circuits in my refrigerator-freezer, the electronic control circuits in my 10,000 BTU window A/C which enable it to draw just half the power of my 14,000 BTU dual-hose portable A/C; my voice-recognition TV remote...<br><br>A voice-recognition TV remote is an outstanding example where digital excels and analog will not ever be able to match!<br><br>That said, some applications for analog computers exist where they&#39;re actually cheaper to make and will work under conditions digital computers find hostile.<br><br>One such example is as a mechanical RPM governor.  Small engines use air vanes connected to the carburetor.  As the RPM increases, the air vanes are blown by the engine&#39;s cooling fan, thereby reaching an upper RPM limit.  Most people have seen governors on larger engines, usually as two spinning balls hanging at an angle.  As they spin, they rise, applying a counter-force to the throttle, thereby limiting the RPM.<br><br>Even in these applications, however, digital has taken over.  Back to my truck...  The digitally-controlled RPM limit when it&#39;s in park or neutral is about 3,200 RPM.  While in gear, it&#39;s about 4,500 RPM.

I think the sub conches is linked to this base Intelligence and if not so being conches would be to over whelming for the human mind. I am looking for a simple geometric form units equal points a simple structure that could account for receptivity and awareness via our quantum biology. Like that principle in quantum physics Quantum Entanglement. Its tricky to represent in a remedial math style like mine without illustrations but I will try.  <br><br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>2 = 6 Zero&#39;s, 7 = 14 Zero&#39;s, 3 = 3 Zero&#39;s, (decimal point) 1 + 5 = 6. \r<br>2 = 6 Zero&#39;s, 7 = 14 Zero&#39;s, 4 = 4 Zero&#39;s, (decimal point) 1 + 5 = 6.\r<br>2 = 6 Zero&#39;s, 7 = 14 Zero&#39;s, 5 = 5 Zero&#39;s, (decimal point) 1 + 5 = 6. \r<br>2 = 6 Zero&#39;s, 7 = 14 Zero&#39;s, 6 = 6 Zero&#39;s, (decimal point) 1 + 5 = 6. \r<br>.. = 24 ............ =56 .............. = 18 ............................................ = 24<br><br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>ok that should be simple 24, 56, 18, 24\r<br> \r<br>\r<br>\r<br>56 + 18 = 74 With the idea of set&#39;s I brake 70 in to seven parts six parts and one part. And four in to four parts. I keep in mind that Absolute zero and three degrees above at that level the quantum effect is in play and the rules of math may work differently so my Idea&#39;s maybe warranted.<br><br>\r<br>\r<br>In mind I have a hyper cube because it has 16 points and within that hypercube I have a box you could say a box within a box within a box and this structure has 24 points. <br><br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>So imagine two of these structures one for each of the 24&#39;s at each end. Also think if it as being two hypercubes each with half of a hypercube within each. And have the  Quantum Entanglement and human receptivity in mind and the Law of Three from the Enneagram of Personality. Where in the C in A B C is contained within the A and B of two parts.<br><br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>Then we need a one two and three dimensional structure. and that is where the 56 + 18 = 74. I got side tracked but back to the 56 + 18 = 74 With the idea of set&#39;s I brake 70 in to seven parts six parts and one part. And four in to four parts. I keep in mind that Absolute zero and three degrees above at that level the quantum effect is in play and the rules of math may work differently so my Idea&#39;s maybe warranted.<br><br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>So with Set theory in mind I brake the 70 into two parts six and one six is ( up down left right back forward ) six is the three dimensional plain. The one is the one plain and sits in the middle. So now in mind you should have seven dots looking like a basic Cartesian Plain. Made of seven ones or seven units or seven points in space at the quantum level of mechanical operations. The four in the 74 is the four corner points of a sheet a two dimensional sheet and can be envisioned as being on one of the plains. at this point it is getting a bit tricky for me. <br><br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>I have also another simple structure were I brake down 48 from 24 + 24 into a five tier&#39;s 48, 24, 12, 6, 3 and then I abstract three units into  six half&#39;s I place this on a Helix with a tringle between and on a circle  It&#39;s the Enneagram symbol.  I am trying to link it all back to the enneagram the nine energies human mind. So the six Half &#39;s are envisioned in a way that at point: 7 &amp; 8 the two two from two of the two half&#39;s looks like the number 2 is at Point&#39;s seven and eight and the two one&#39;s have  have been added together and Placed at Point: 3 <br><br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>I repeat this process for the remaining four half&#39;s at Points 4 &amp; 5 and 1 &amp; 2 of the helix and the triangle gets the remaining four units of one&#39;s making three sets of two. So now the Enneagram&#39;s Nine Points all Have a number value of Two at each of the Nine Points.<br><br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>I am not saying the model is correct but for every thing to nest so well and cleanly may warrant investigation.<br><br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>The Idea of hyper cubes sitting at the level of fields sounds to simple and maybe incorrect but the idea of three sets of 16 one dimensional point at work two with half of one in each maybe modeled in a more traditional mathematics model.<br><br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>I am just a layman looking at solving a set of problems no one can seem to solve and I think they are all linked together.

If you&#39;re suggesting analog is somehow making a comeback because of what you showed, that&#39;s a fallacy since it was binary digital systems running the AI, not analog.  There&#39;s an A to D conversion basically, but in the case of digital imaging it&#39;s hard to say that even that is analog, but sure this can take analog signal, do a A to D conversion and then work with the data to produce an output.<br><br><br>The only comments I&#39;m going to say is analog calculations certainly have a place, it&#39;s incredibly limited, and so do digital, and bringing up the atom has nothing to do with anything.  <br><br><br>There&#39;s one thing you got wrong, and that&#39;s the world is approaching the size of an atom for a transistor in an IC.  Not even the conductor that runs through a transistor that is switched to either conduct or be disabled is near that size.  But if that happens, where the main conductor is the size of an atom, the transistor itself is still clearly larger than an atom.  But I can use copper.  The size of a copper atom is 0.128 nm in diameter.  Right now we&#39;re approaching 2nm transistors, and that&#39;s not a diameter of the transistor.  In fact it&#39;s nothing anymore.  The different things you can consider is what is the length and what is the surface area of it.  You can also consider the distance from one transistor to the next.   It&#39;s true that the length of transistors have gotten very small, but the surface area is still pretty large.  That isn&#39;t changing any time soon.  I&#39;d get into dimensions of transistors but it&#39;s too complex and a person has to read a long description to comprehend it, and then you understand that the numbers being used right now by companies don&#39;t quite relate to anything specific, but what you can look at is transistor density on a die.  But even that is 2 dimensions and excludes height since transistors aren&#39;t stacked.  So transistors aren&#39;t approaching the size of an atom.  Not even close.  They ARE getting to where the length is very short, like a few atoms long if you were to take one atom and lay it exactly beside another atom, but since atoms form a structure it really doesn&#39;t work that way, so even with lengths shrinking, the length is still many atoms.  And this is TOO MUCH on this topic.  We&#39;re at least 2 decades away from worrying about the size of a transistor, and even then, transistor density is the real issue and that can be increased by stacking, since ever smaller transistors means less current, smaller voltage and less heat so we have a long ways before we worry about it.<br><br><br><br><br><br>Lastly, to ADD 2 digital numbers, you need the storage for the original numbers, and then if this is non-gated addition (the output of these two storage devices feed straight to something that will add them) then depending on how the addition is worked out you wouldn&#39;t need too many logic gates, but a logic gate is made of multiple transistors.  Your answer then has to be gated to a register, or it can be non-gated, so basically you have 2 registers that hold the addends and one register for the sum.  Or addends can be in different places such as memory.  Registers requires a LOT of gates and therefore many more transistors, since even the simplest logic gate is multiple transistors.  The problem with non-gated inputs to registers is the inputs constantly change.  This is fine, but then you need a controlled clock signal to an enable for each bit of the register (basically one bit = 1 flip-flop).  That way you enable the output of the adder to be clocked into the register that holds the sum.  Each flip-flop is a few logic gates and once again each logic gate is multiple transistors.  So saying you need 50 transistors to do an 8 bit addition would be a very uncontrolled addition and doesn&#39;t include where the values are.  I&#39;d like to see the circuit.", "comment_date": "2022-04-28T03:55:42Z", "likes_count": 15}, {"comment_by": "New Diary", "comment_text": "wow i havent understand anything about neurons until I watched this vid, your explanation is brilliant.

This distinction is important because each type of cell has evolved over time to do specific things with specific compounds based on its DNA program or blueprint.   Because these cells are designed to operate on or generate specific biochemical compounds, they are not doing extra work.  And each of these compounds therefore are innately biologically discrete and distinct from other compounds in other cells representing other behaviors and functions.   So the brain cells innately know how to distinguish an &quot;activation&quot; or &quot;signal&quot; representing a color or visual attribute from a sound, or a feeling and so forth.  Therefore, the brain has a much easier time understanding such sensory phenomena because it has these fundamental components that are distinct with implicit meaning that does not require extra processing to decipher<br><br>On the other hand, binary data is a data  format that has no inherent meaning outside of being a string of ones and zeroes and when you say digital that is what you are referring to. Everything in a computer is a string of ones and zeroes and looking at any string of ones and zeroes does not tell you anything about the higher level data that this binary string represents.  There is no intrinsic meaning to these values in the binary space as all the meaning comes from the higher levels of the computing stack in software, where a binary string can be a variable containing a temperature value or a variable containing a value for the r, g or b color of a pixel.   But there is nothing inherent in the binary data itself that tells you it is one or the other, which is fine when you are making general purpose computers based on binary math logic.   However, the problem becomes compounded when you start talking about AI because now not only does binary have no explicit meaning, but neither do numbers held in vectors as part of dot products in matrix multiplication.    49.5 or 79.3 have no absolute meaning to anybody relative to anything in the real world outside of being numbers.   It is only within the context of an individual instance of a statistical sampling algorithm (most neural networks) that such values can be assigned a meaning.    So 49.3 could be a weight or it could be the percentage of confidence that an image contains a dog or a cat.  The only thing that these kinds of neural networks are doing is just crunching more and more numbers to try and find a meaningful statistical model in euclidean space, which goes back to the analog vs digital sampling analogy.  Which means that you are spending a lot of time and energy to provide meaning to a specific value in euclidean (number) space and it doesn&#39;t matter whether you do it via binary circuits or analog circuits, the same problem still exists.", "comment_date": "2022-03-31T21:20:27Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Thomas Smith", "comment_text": "no we dont need a AI to think like us!!!,", "comment_date": "2022-03-31T19:03:18Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Laurent H", "comment_text": "There will be nothing beyond our actual computer world.", "comment_date": "2022-03-31T18:35:13Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "coladict", "comment_text": "Audio and video didn&#39;t go digital because it&#39;s better quality, they went digital because the quality difference is finally below our perceptive abilities, and the editing of digital content is much, much easier.

Although I don&#39;t really agree with the last sentence: &quot;Our brain is digital in how a neuron fires or not...&quot;. What does it mean for a neuron to fire? In most cases, when neurons fire, they release small chemical messengers: neurotransmitters. But this neurotransmission is not All or Nothing. The amount of neurotransmitter that is released is proportional to the firing frequency of the neuron (the number of stimuli that reach it per unit of time). So in the Neuron-Neuron connections, the information becomes analog again.<br>This means that in each presynaptic nerve terminal (the terminal of the neuron that is going to transmit to the next) the information becomes analog again. In addition, there are neurons that do not fire action potentials (they do not behave as &quot;digital agents&quot;), because they do not have axons (those extensions that transmit All or Nothing). In general, these neurons modulate the degree of excitability of other neurons: the probability that the receiving neuron will or will not fire an action potential. The latest studies that appear in the video on the combination of analog and digital are very interesting.

Essentially the brain can be mapped and re-mapped by graphting a holographic/digital shape, however chaotic a bunch of signals may seem and non shape like. The  circuit may be hardware but the electrical currents can be influenced and atleast largely controlled by software and hardware, such as a hat. It reminds me a bit of the Celtic Torca necklace/headband. It may sound a bit far fetched but perhaps the purpose of Ancient headwear and many tools and weapons of the gods may really work, at the time atleast. Given the em levels may have changed since that time it is possible there is an interference stopping them from working or may not have been tested for the purposes intended by the designers. Perhaps like the analogue computer the weapons/tools of the gods required a certain electrical or toxin level in the users body to interact with them. In terms of data storage and creating extra dimensional storage space perhaps it possible to take a regular crystal structure like a cube, and direct a current through it sufficient enough to form a cube within the cube, like a Tesseract cube within a hypercube, or perhaps arrange some of a hypercube Net (a cross) within the cube and perhaps extending outside of the cube to attach to a device equivelent to a battery placed in a device to extract power obtained via a pizo like effect, if the battery were a crystal. There could potentially be many advantages of forming such a structure and it could potentially be sustained by an external enclosure to act as a magnetic containment field if need be to protect it from external influences that could disrupt the crystal and field. Suddenly playing the old game of dropping bars and polygons onto eachother like the sky TV game Beehive Bedhlam could pay off. It is essentially a game of data conversion and transfer faster than the inbound data clogs the system and fills a box, the screen after all. You could think of the disappearance of the dropping bars/balls/boxes as being matched up/arranged into sets that enables entry into a higher dimensional space, which is comparable to being the equivelant to the tesseract cube, hypercube and/or metatrons cube.

Even when the necessary computing power was available already, the real power of neural networks comes with more depth (more layers). The important breakthrough (surprisingly) not mentioned in the video is the initialization strategy of weights, that allowed the backpropagation to be used with many layers, which in turn allowed the neural networks to become much deeper (more layers), and thus more powerful.<br>Of course, this is still just a workaround, and not considered a true solution to the problem of learning.<br><br>As for thoughts on the future. I doubt that analog will take over from digital. We already have dedicated video-encoding chips, responsible for a specific task. Whether that task is executed analog or digital does not really matter from a higher order perspective. A major advantage not directly given as such in the video, is that analog and specifically neural networks are a black box. You will use it for something, but you will never exactly understand how it works. Using digital technology, you have the power to virtualize, which means you can always inspect the software, no matter how complicated, and understand at some level how it works, and how it came to a certain decision. Even digital neural networks are already considered to be a black box, that are much more difficult to understand than other methods of machine learning. Surely analog has its place, but only as separate tools that have been proven to work in isolated use-cases, it will most definitely not take over digital technology.", "comment_date": "2022-03-16T18:36:54Z", "likes_count": 10}, {"comment_by": "Dan Hammond", "comment_text": "They could increase the efficiency of recycling sorting using this ai.

Nowadays, in  a lot of control systems, the inputs are analog that has to be digitized for the computers / software to do the math on and then  converted back to an analog for an output.  I always had my doubts that a true AI (if something like that is technically feasible) could be produced by a digital computer. The human brain and body seems fundamentally analog. Even with more advanced analog systems, I have my doubts about whether or not human or even animal like AI could be achieved.

I am very enthusiastic. Let me confess that I only read a few of the comments, hence mine may be somehow duplicates. Nevertheless here they go.<br><br>Around the minute 13 in the video there is a climax. We are told, with beautiful graphical imagery, that a neural network has been trained to recognize certain patterns, presumably using backpropagation of errors. The network has a hundred or so layers and was eventually able to recognize the patterns with only a small percentage of failures. Obviously, it must have taken a long time since the procedure used as much energy as consumed by three households during a year. The energy consumption is then a problem comparable with bitcoin mining. Hence analog computers are proposed as a viable alternative that deserves a chance, and I agree. But a couple of relevant facts should be taken into account. <br><br>First, whatever can be recognized with a perceptron neural network having 100 layers (any number of units per layers) can also be recognized with a three layer network (input layer, hidden layer and output layer). If a smaller number of layers were initially chosen the time and energy consumption could have been orders of magnitude smaller. This means that favoring analog computers may not be the only interesting alternative to the inefficiency of backpropagation. Trust me, I have meditated about backpropagation for the task of neural network learning and have satisfied myself that it is something very, very, very inefficient.<br><br>Second, and related to the above, nothing is said in the video about the architecture and weights of the initial network, the one modified along many epochs of backpropagation to obtain a final network that only committed a small number of mistakes. It seems they did not have a controllable and fast algorithm that could look at the data vectors and propose an initial architecture and weights that could be rapidly trainable to avoid mistakes when recognizing patterns. A good enough algorithm would actually provide a neural network so good that no backpropagation training is needed. This would be a game changer. Such algorithm exists, has been coded into a program and tested with results as expected.<br><br>But regardless of these comments I need to express my congratulations to the authors of this intelligent video which I understand are Derek Muller, Stephen Welch and Emily Zhang.<br><br>With cordial regards to everyone,<br>Daniel Crespin", "comment_date": "2022-03-13T14:55:39Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Teacher inThailan", "comment_text": "Fascinating and very well explained.

Sadly, today&#39;s chip manufacturers are not interested in exploring this technoloy as the benefits would be minuscule, while it also means discarding decades of knowledge in circuit optimization and chip manufacturing techniques.

This is mixing up analog vs asynchronous. You can do digital computation synchronously or asynchronously. The main difference in analog vs digital is that digital is discrete values, and typically binary but you could also make digital ternary computers that has a 0,1, or 2 value (though those are very esoteric), or potentially even higher radixes. The main reason we use binary for digital computers is the speed of distinguishing 2 voltage level vs a larger number of voltage levels.<br>EDIT: Intel has a second generation DIGITAL asynchronous chip for simulating a network of neurons, Lohi2 (the first gen was Lohi). They call the technology Neuromorphic Computing. Basically it&#39;s an application specific integrated circuit (ASIC) with artificial neurons doing matrix multiplications and storing activation weights, and massively parallell asynchronous busses connecting around a million neurons with routing options for configuring which neurons should connect to what. They call this kind of async network of neurons for a Spiking Neural Network.

Many times through history, things exist and evolve does not mean the direction they are going is optimal, or even correct. For example, the letter arrangement on the common keyboard was intentionally designed to slow down the typing because the old mechanical typewriter can not keep up the speed. But since people are so used to it and developing upon it, the layout is kept even after we advanced to the digital age. The birth of the digital computer is to tackle the problem that analog signal is not accurate enough and can be easily interfered with during transmission. Since we keep building more and more powerful digital computers, we start taking them for granted and ignoring how inefficient encoding everything with 2 digits. After all, if we can get unlimited processing speed, who cares if each computation is a bit longer due to limited digits. But the reality is, sooner or later we will hit the limit of how fast digital computers can go. The same logic applies to the deep learning field. Once people realized simplify adding layers to the neural network can improve the results. Even for a little gain, people are likely to do so without hesitation despite more layers significantly complicating the training and inference time (AlexNet 8 layers VS ResNet hundreds of layers). Many years later, people may even realize the foundation of the neural network is incorrect. The whole reason we made such progress is only because we have more advanced computers and datasets. Imagine in a computer VS human multiple choice competition, a program answered all questions correctly not because it can reason but because it tried all 999 wrong answers a million times faster than the human. Instead of building faster computers, what will happen if we truly teach the computer to reason?

The way you described weights and pathing in that analog chip is literally the beginning. I have been considering a reliable means of extreme data compression for over 20 years. The reason this is important is the bus speed you spoke of, but in both the board of the computer as well as the connectivity between machines. For example, being able to download a 60 gig video game in a second or two would be revolutionary to saybthe least. Imagine a dial up connection in the future being as fast as fiber is today. But fiber isn&#39;t even good in its current form. Imagine if your home pc was a neural network connected to a billion others? The data itself wouldn&#39;t need to be passed directly. The understanding of what the data is would be transmitted. The concept is only available via variable analog, not digital. The constraints of a simple switch is already being felt across the industry. There is an infinite number of results between 0 and 1. The biggest problem I have faced researching as many as 100 different compression algorithms is the inability to decode the compressed data. I have used everything from quadratic equations to digits along PI. You can compress data as much as you want but you can&#39;t get it back due to specificity. I&#39;ve known analog was the solution for 2 decades. I am happy to see the industry finally figuring this out and making real strides toward it. But there is a real gotcha. If we do not maintain control of the machines, they really will cause great harm. Logic dictates a lot of undesirable outcomes. We must be it&#39;s conscience!

Since you have an infinite range of possible outputs (not just 1 and 0), you can&#39;t know if there is an error and you can&#39;t go further to correcting the error. Those are the fundamental reasons for transforming to digital domain where you have only ones and zeros. But yeah, in a very controlled environment, you can have superior performance as the errors become negligible. With that said, I think this kind of computers is very sensitive to operation conditions and in high temperature it won&#39;t servive and as compared to digital computers which have stable performance over a range of temperature, its performance is expected to degrade proportionally with temperature.

Certainly, these ideas are only applicable for the next 30-50 years, since in more distant periods, the advances will be much more extreme, unimaginable even for us today.<br><br>1- While human technological advances have been enormous, the real breakthroughs will come with artificial intelligences. When conscious machines begin to create, we will see how far we were from understanding the structure and limits of reality. <br><br>2- Soon machines will be not only intelligent, but also conscious and therefore equal in dignity and rights to humans. Probably, an extension of the concept of humanity will be applied, grouping both traditional humanity and conscious machines. On the success of such a community depends the whole future. <br><br>3- Death will be defeated. Fragile and imperfect biological bodies will be replaced by bodies made of more resistant materials. The mind/consciousness/spirit of people will be transferred from the brain to a system that can contain it permanently, immune to any possibility of damage. <br><br>4- Humanity will expand throughout the universe, colonizing other planets from which it will obtain resources and new knowledge. Parallel digital realities will also be created, with their own space and time. There will be human beings who will live their lives entirely in digital environments. <br><br>5- Humanity will have a world government that will coordinate the evolution of civilization. All the miseries associated with human beings - war, famine, disease, cruelty - will be systematically eradicated. Nothing will be able to oppose the world government. <br><br>6- It is impossible from the present moment to foresee what the ideas or ways of thinking of future humanity will be like, since it will be liberated from a good part of our present oppressions. It is useless to anticipate too much, since our present mental arsenal is precarious compared to what we will have in a few years. <br><br>7- Humans will no longer have a specific sex. New human beings will not be born from female human bodies. New births will be completely artificial and controlled, thus avoiding any kind of pathologies. The illusion of chance will lose the romantic charm it still retains. <br><br>8- Any conservative opposition to these technological and cultural changes will be easily overcome, because the changes will be of such intensity that any opposition will imply being at an absolute disadvantage compared to the rest of society. This process of change is irreversible and unstoppable. <br><br>9- All human beings that have ever existed will return to life. Paradise is in the future and is a human creation. The human being will gradually understand what God really is. <br><br>10- There will be intense space travel in search of other forms of life. In addition, all the necessary protection will be sought so as not to enter into conflict with those other forms of life. This will imply that humanity, while ceasing its internal military conflicts, must nevertheless be prepared to respond to any attack from other worlds.", "comment_date": "2022-03-09T20:57:22Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Justas Mackevicius", "comment_text": "Derek is what people of high intelligence describe as doesn&#39;t know that he doesn&#39;t know.", "comment_date": "2022-03-09T20:42:31Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Monchy Tales", "comment_text": "&gt;mentions metaverse <br>and like that you&#39;ve lost me", "comment_date": "2022-03-09T20:30:14Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Tired Of Liars", "comment_text": "So, analog computers can be configured to do many different specific tasks using a single board, so we couple that with the digital computer making the alterations to the configuration on an As Needed basis.

"comment_text": "use analog with a field programmable array. a field programmable array itself would be a better CPU already than a normal CPU as long as you have a few normal cored dedicated to managing/programming them. when using it with a analog computer you get much larger detail. analog computers however can be used to do many of the things quantumcomputers are great for, since a quantum computer is actually kind of like a analog computer fpga combined, with a small processor to control, read, and send signals to it. only the quantum makes it seem fictional to many while it is actually just a parallel programmable analog computer simulating something which seems fictional to people, and it seeming fictional to them is actually it&#39;s strength, because most users do not understand it which makes it more easy for them to learn to use and control it in multiple ways. just like how a highly intelligent person never learns to learn in many cases due to a lack of challenge and fun, while a less intelligent person learns to learn. the same example can also be inverted since a average person learned a lot they will have trouble with coming up with something new, finding faults, or improvements, etc, where a highly interested person who will be able to improve things by a lot in a drastivcal way, and notice possibilities due to them knowing things in another way than normal learning and knowing(assuming something is right is what most peoples knowing is), instead highly intelligent people are more likely to understand thing not as how they are described in the books but how they are actually working in depth. so I often use a simple schematic to figure out if someone is highly intelligent and in general it is always right, only on cases which are just on the edge it becomes harder, in a simple way: normal people think digital in true and false, with objects and such seen as absolute things and single unrelated points unless a instruction tells them so, I often call this one dimensional or digital thinking. highly intelligent people think much more analog, there often aren&#39;t even real true or falses, but also thinking parallel, many things at a time. and often this is used in a multidimensional way where everything and anything is taken into consideration of being possibly correlated, things like gravity difference across the universe wouldnn&#39;t be on the mind of a average person designing a acceleration measurement device, but to a highly intelligent person such things suddenly matter. but also the effects of electric or magnetic charge on for example physical resistance would only occur to a normal person if they specifically need to measure it for their study. while in a highly intelligent person it is often directly simulated and the effects quite realistically estimated in their mind whenever they are just thinking about the beginning stages of the project. some highly intelligent people simulate things much more accurate in their mind than a computer simulation, and/or set of calculations is capable of. they are also much more universal and simulate many many things at a time including many possible ways, the same thing but then endles instances with small differences, etc. which allows them to find a working solution when a normal solution does not. highly intelligent people however often do not have the detail as in numbers, many do have relative values like %, but no actual numbers, using digital stuff is also harder for them due to it often being one dimensional single state things which go directly against how they think. note that I have only found a few people worldwide as of yet capable of doing such simulations properly, but based on them and many other things there likely are a lot more, since such people often have a lot of problems in the modern society due to their totaly different thinking style, seeing through more illusions which many normal people don&#39;t even notice themselves, and the extreme &quot;chaos&quot;, distraction and focus, they are almost always distracted or unfoccussed unless they suddenly get excited/excitement, or are just suddenly really interested or want something, at that point their focus is far more extreme than a normal person would reach since they only care about the things they want at those points and will often forget

Analog-digital systems sound good but for the digital end of that system you need between 3.5 and 5.2 billion things to go right every single second. This number is floating around 4.09 billion things that need to go right every second as I write this on my laptop. The answer to this problem is more likely to be found with digital systems that are mission specific. There are chips that are digital, are extremely exact, perform exactly one operation in a repeatable way, and cost very little energy (1-5 watts).<br><br>Moore&#39;s law seems to be irrelevant in this day and age as it has become extremely possible and some might even say easy to get around the issue of transistor gate size (the size of transistors themselves rarely change between generations). The answer is to create transistors with multiple gates which is actually old news in the computer world. Currently companies like Intel produce general purpose computing chips that have non-planar transistors that they call &quot;gate-all-around&quot; chips. Beyond this you just stack transistors in new and interesting geometries. First into a third plane to create 3d chips (this is being done) and then expanding on this by making transistors into other geometries such as octagonal prisms that contain 24 gates and connect each to 10 other transistors. This will obviously be less energy efficient at first but at processes like this mature enough for sales to the public they become more energy efficient. Consider the 1st generation AMD Ryzen processor pitted against the current generation. In just a few years the energy efficiency increased by orders of magnitude requiring less than half the wattage per core and providing up to 200% more performance with half the energy requirement.<br><br>You can actually pay Intel right now to make you a chip that knows how to do nothing other than multiplying two matrices and sending the result to system memory on a gate-all-around microarchitecture that utilized less than 5 watts to operate. There are many companies that make these single-purpose or limited multi-purpose chips. Another great example of a more general chip can be found in RISC, which can perform many actions but is intentionally limited in the scope of its instruction set to utilize less power and make the process more efficient by increasing the speed at which it performs tasks.<br><br>Analog solves a problem that doesn&#39;t truly exist. The real problem is that there are too many AI and ML developers who don&#39;t understand the hardware they are using, nor do the fully comprehend the hardware available to them. Realistically the future of computing will end the CPU era and likely move on to the SoC era where all primary chips of your system will have many smaller purpose made chips on them. Market forces have largely begun to favor products made in this way as AMD and their recent success in the last 5 years will attest to. While analog chips have made a slight resurgence, the combined value of that entire industry is less than the value of AMD&#39;s market share increase.", "comment_date": "2022-03-09T04:26:45Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Tristin Nelsen", "comment_text": "Ah yes, let me just pull out my oscilloscope", "comment_date": "2022-03-09T04:24:23Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Z S", "comment_text": "this machine is not a computer at all.", "comment_date": "2022-03-09T04:17:04Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "N3d_Ludd", "comment_text": "wow", "comment_date": "2022-03-09T04:15:19Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "warrax111", "comment_text": "Generation Alpha - watching porn on analog computers", "comment_date": "2022-03-09T04:11:01Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Albert F.", "comment_text": "But, why bother?

The outputs of the associator layer units were the weighted connections, and they were the weights altered by what Rosenblatt termed the &quot;error correction&quot; algorithm.  What he found, and proved as a theorem, was that if there was a solution to a dichotomy possible, the device would find it by the &quot;error correction&quot; method, even if the trainer made errors of up to 30%.  On the other hand, if you changed the associator-to-response weights without regard to errors, a solution was not a sure thing.

The limit of Rosenblatt&#39;s perceptron was not in the lack of depth; it was in the utilized activation function of the neurons model. This was the essential contribution of Minsky and Papert&#39;s cited paper, that showed how, in spite of its layering depth, no perceptron could have solved the rather well known, and extremely simple problem of xor recognition; this destroyed the confidence in the approach. For a few decades.<br><br>The element that changed the whole picture was the introduction of continuous activation function of a peculiar shape (and with further mathematical peculiarities), tipically named sigmoid (due to their S shape), that allowed Robert Hecht-Nielsen to formulate his continuity representation /existential/ theorem, stating that for any continuous function of n variables there is a three layer sigmoidal-activation-function-unit network that can compute it. The matter was that being just an existential theorem, it did not tell how wide the layer should have been, and various practical experiments showed that a more-than-three layers network could learn more easily than a three layers one. Things were working fine sometimes and not as much some others. This is told in the video, and I&#39;ll have to get better information on the cited paper of Fei Fei Li to combine its content with my old memories, but for years lots of trials were made, and papers written to get where we are today. A very interesting MOOC kept by Andrew Ng (Stanford) tells way more about overfitting, and various other issues you will have to address when teaching a network.<br><br>2. Rather than from early failures of neural networks, AI winter came more from the fail of so called fifth-generation languages hype, or what at the time was named, in an old-fashion parlance, Hard-AI, that is, the belief the a with an inferential engine and a good knowledge base any problem could be solved through the application of deduction and induction steps. Actually the re-sprouting of artificial neural network in the late 80s gave a shake revamping interest and hopes in what was then called Soft-AI, or connection-based AI, where less about the reasoning, and more about the mapping was put into action.<br><br>3. Significant advances in specific achievement of &quot;intelligent&quot; manifestations were obtained through the speedup of computation power, but more than that, from the development of more sophisticated computational models for neurons and their interconnections (recurrent, convolutional, LSTM, etc.) that appeared to be far better suited to the solution of specific recognition problems (continuous speech, rotation-independent image-recognition, and so on); for many of them the utilization of analog computers may help, but the true essential ingredient, analog or digital, is the usage of massive parallelism, what was once called a MIMD architecture, that indeed is today reflected in GPUs, as well as in other highly parallelized computation systems. <br><br>4. For decades it has been known that the Parallel Distributed Processing was an essential ingredient (as our brain inspired from the moment we started understanding a tiny fraction of how it works from the /inside/), and today we have fantastic frameworks that ease the abstraction on the underneath implementation details (tensorflow, azure, and other deep-learning/machine learning wrappers) but to get where we are today it took, still, decades, to become good at recognizing moving objects and at /somehow/ understand spoken sentences, still with a lot of actual limitations on continuous reliability and adaptations abilities in presence of knowledge field affinity, or on non-just-spoken contextual sensitivity. Decades were needed to trim models and algorithms to be good at recognizing just a very small fraction of what our brain is still far more capable of putting together, in terms of variety. Sure, the achieved results are amazing, and we can expect to automate, to some degree various decision problems (e.g.: steering, breaking and accelerating, accepting indications, suggestions, requests, all related to conducting <b>a vehicle*), but there the best that we can do is to narrow the distance between what we can compute in a fraction of time of how it required in the past, and what we cannot really determine to be *right*, because such a *right</b> is out of reach from a purely technical or scientific context, or worse, simply not really well known yet, as this long pandemic period has clearly recalled to all of us.<br><br>Very likely combining analog and digital components will be giving more that we have today, but as you very accurately remarked in the video, analog computers do not have the same expressive power (in terms of generality) of digital computers, and that will remain so until we&#39;ll have the ability to synthesize generic arbitrarily complex analog circuitry on the fly, a thing that I can say but have not the faintest Idea of how it could possibly ever be achieved; analog design is still today considered far more an art than digital design is :D.<br><br>To some extent this links to the other nice video of yours on the Hole in Math (built around G\u00f6del&#39;s Incompleteness Theorem, and on undecidability) but what it really is about is the fact that whether analog or digital, the computation will always be just that, a computation; that&#39;s relevant, and we can learn to keep improving it, but it will remain just a fraction of the whole picture, in a world that still misses opportunities for collaboration in place of fights, and destruction, alas.<br><br>We&#39;re not building computers wrong, we&#39;re just learning from our mistakes, sometimes forgetting too much, something you can say only retrospectively, and here I can really say I went too far away from my starting point :D.<br><br>Thanks for your videos!", "comment_date": "2022-03-08T20:43:56Z", "likes_count": 10}, {"comment_by": "Function at the Junction", "comment_text": "Narrator: A man tragically drowned in Chesapeake Bay.<br><br>Subtitles: Upbeat music plays...", "comment_date": "2022-03-08T20:42:35Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "formdoggie5", "comment_text": "All you have to do is listen to a record to know that digital isn&#39;t superior.<br><br>Thats why they still exist.<br><br>I can go pull my U2 Joshua Tree album out and it, to this day, sounds better: and the reason why is because digital cuts out the highs and lows because of how it has to break a wave form into samples of that wave form.", "comment_date": "2022-03-08T20:41:30Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "TEAser", "comment_text": "Video was good, but Title and Thumbnail are quite the clickbait, a tad too much in my opinion", "comment_date": "2022-03-08T20:40:23Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "inxiti", "comment_text": "The scary logical conclusion once you follow the analog assumptions to the end is that it means in physics the universe is all just pure chance, and not perfectly repeatable like digital.

Our senses (our inputs) are all analog and it just intuitively feels like our brains couldn&#39;t be primarily digital given how variable the inputs are each time. Of course, I know intuition is typically misleading, but I just thought this would give some context behind my motivation for writing this.<br><br>I&#39;ve always believed that human brains are generally inconsistent in thought (e.g. self-contradiction) and produce varying outputs like not being able to reliably tap a finger on a desk exactly the same way five times in a row let alone twice (I can&#39;t even imagine the exact same thing twice without at least some variation). I wonder, then, if it&#39;s because our brain sends inconsistent instructions to our fingers, if it&#39;s more of something else down the line that&#39;s causing the variation (imprecise tendons?), or maybe even some other factor in the brain such as being distracted in-between taps. Maybe none of this is true. After all, it&#39;s just my anecdotal observation.<br><br>This also reminds me of something I learned early in programming where I was taught that computers were really good at doing calculations and logical operations etc. yet were bad at things humans find trivial such as facial recognition and language comprehension (like how so many of us struggle with maths yet pick up language easily while digital computers struggle with the opposite). As computers represented digital I thought it made sense to assume we were analog, though I&#39;m worried that might be a false dichotomy. (I don&#39;t know if anything can be 100% analog, though 100% digital does seem to make sense at least ostensibly hence the reason I used &quot;primarily analog&quot; to describe our brains).<br><br>In short: I&#39;m just wondering if the reason analog is more efficient for building what is essentially a brain is because using analog to build a primarily analog system is intrinsically more efficient than using digital to build a primarily analog system. We&#39;ll still have digital computers to help us do most of the things we&#39;re naturally bad at, but if we want them to be good at what we do, then looking for something that more closely resembles what we actually use such as analog does make a lot of sense.

This is a very common error in teaching about neural networks that I&#39;ve come across several times during my BS and MS courses in computer science.  (Both professors and textbooks on neural networks get this horrifically wrong.)  What you describe as how <i>human</i> neurons work is actually <i>only</i> how virtual neurons in neural networks work, and it would be far more accurate to say that they were <i>inspired by</i> biology rather than saying they are similar to biological neurons in any significant way.<br><br><br>Here is how <i>real</i> neurons work: A neuron is a cell that contains chemicals.  Neurons communicate by adding chemicals (neurotransmitters) to other neurons.  Those chemicals alter the <i>electric charge</i> of the neuron.  When the electric charge of a neuron becomes high enough (exceeds a threshold potential unique to each neuron), an action potential is generated, and the neuron fires, transferring neurotransmitters to neurons it is connected with outgoing connections.<br><br>How is this different from neural networks?<br><br>First, real neurons don&#39;t have &quot;weights&quot; that are analogous to neural networks.  The amount of neuro-transmitter emitted is highly dependent on varying conditions.  A neuron that fires rapidly can run out of a neurotransmitter, causing it to quit signaling, even when it is firing.  For an example of this, take a piece of white paper, draw two small dots on the paper a centimeter or two apart.  Now, stare at one, but pay attention to the other (and make sure it isn&#39;t in your blind spot).  Eventually the one you are not staring at will disappear.  This is because the cells in the eye that handle transmitting images to the brain are firing faster than they can replenish, have depleted themselves, and are no longer emitting neurotransmitter when they fire.  The &quot;weight&quot; of a neuron, in this context, is dynamic, changing constantly as other neurons fire and add neurotransmitters to it, and as it fires and removes them.  Further, brain chemistry, which varies significantly over time, impacts this.  When synapses (the gaps the neurotransmitters have to traverse to get to the next neuron) are wider, more neurotransmitter is lost and less gets to the target.  Caffeine works by reducing the width of synapses, decreasing loss and increasing the amount of neurotransmitter to reach the target.  This shows that &quot;weight&quot; in this sense actually has very little impact on perception, otherwise Caffeine increasing the &quot;weight&quot; of all neurons in the brain would cause our perception to suddenly go wonky.  What <i>actually</i> affects our perception is mainly <i>timing,</i> and that leads to the second major difference.<br><br>Second, neurons don&#39;t have digital state, the way that you describe (or the way that many neural network professors describe).  They aren&#39;t &quot;on or off&quot;.  Firing is a fairly instantanous event, not a &quot;state&quot; of a neuron.  Neurons don&#39;t run on a digital clock either.  Calculations are happening <i>constantly</i> in massive parallel even <i>far</i> beyond what those analog chips are capable of.   The calculations aren&#39;t synchronized in any way either.  Neural networks aren&#39;t <i>really</i> similar to real biological neural systems at all.  Even the level of connectedness is all wrong.  Neural networks are typically constructed in layers, where each layer is fully connected to the next and the previous, with no connections to any other layer (with some limited exceptions, for example Recurrent Neural Nets connect the end layer to one or more earlier layers to provide some feedback).  Biological neural networks are complex webs, that aren&#39;t even <i>close</i> to fully connected, and there aren&#39;t coherent layers.<br><br>Third, firing is not a function of how many connected neurons are transmitting at what &quot;weight&quot; at any particular time.  Consider a neuron with a single incoming connection.  Now, say that connection is firing at a very slow rate, and it is only providing neurotransmitter (let&#39;s assume one that increases the potential of the neuron) weakly.  That neuron <i>will still eventually fire.</i>  A neuron with a lot of connections firing rapidly may fire far more quickly, as it reaches its threshold potential more frequently, but this isn&#39;t an analog of &quot;weight&quot; either, because there is no fire or not fire.  It&#39;s <i>going to eventually fire.</i>  The variable in question isn&#39;t whether it is firing at any particular time, it&#39;s <i>when</i> and <i>how often.</i>  Even using an analog processor for neural networks isn&#39;t anything like that. <br><br>The fact is, neural networks are <i>only</i> inspired by biological neural systems.  They aren&#39;t <i>actually</i> close to biological neural systems, and the only real inspiration taken from biological neural systems is the use of many simple nodes in a highly connected network (which <i>was</i> ingenious but not terribly interesting).  The truth is, trying to teach how biological neural systems work in a CS class or video on neural networks is pretty pointless, because if you taught it correctly, it would only serve to confuse because of how little the two have in common, and if you don&#39;t teach it correctly, you are <i>miseducating people,</i> which is a pretty horrible thing to do for someone who claims to be dedicated to teaching objective science correctly.<br><br><br>Anyhow, I&#39;m not trying to be mean or rude, but I really like your videos, and it&#39;s painful to me that you screwed this up so badly.  Might I suggest not trusting sources that are going <i>far</i> out of their expertise in explaining why something within it works.  More often than not, I find they are wrong, because they don&#39;t actually understand the analogy and are often only pointing to it for unnecessary validation.  The fact is, neural networks <i>work,</i> and there is no need for textbooks and professors to <i>pretend</i> like they understand neurobiology to validate them.  The <i>full extent</i> of the truth is that some computer scientist, who didn&#39;t actually understand neurobiology himself, designed an AI system loosely inspired by his limited understanding of biological neural systems and was lucky enough that it actually worked.  And that&#39;s all anyone needs to say.  There&#39;s no need to give a whole lecture on neurobiology that is horribly, painfull wrong on nearly every level, to justify a design that has already been proven effective.", "comment_date": "2022-03-08T05:37:18Z", "likes_count": 4}, {"comment_by": "Grimmlocked", "comment_text": "Maybe that imprecision is the key. <br>Maybe the thing that makes our brains so good is the permission to be wrong.", "comment_date": "2022-03-08T05:28:24Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Erfan Mola", "comment_text": "That Marker On The CardBoard Sound, SUCKS !", "comment_date": "2022-03-08T05:27:51Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Mitch Haelann", "comment_text": "I&#39;m wondering about the possible uses of those analog chips for GPU work, running faster, cooler graphics cards.", "comment_date": "2022-03-08T05:13:08Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "inovade", "comment_text": "is this how those robots/golem were made, mostly from myth or stories since they definitely not using digital but analog? maybe those were the truth but we just lost the technology?", "comment_date": "2022-03-08T05:11:45Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Anesio Henrique", "comment_text": "That comes with that idea of talking to a scientist from the future.

We will get the difficult questions in life out of the way so there is no question about what my motives are or what they are percieved to be. <br>Is there life after death? A question we all ask ourselves and the answer is simple yes indeed there is life after death. We have seen people die and other people &quot;living&quot; so to speak and we can all comprehend that after we inevitability die othe people around us will continue to live on. In that sense then life does continue after death, weather you participate in it is completely up to you. <br>Now then on to the really difficult stuff....the life we are all living. What if I told you that science and spirit we&#39;re in a way very similar in meaning. It is ones way of interpretation of the world around them. Weather you want the big\u00a0 Father Figure &quot;God&quot; to represent what you believe, or if you yourself believe that science, is the unrelenting force that drives us to an end goal.

How in the same breath can one say we had to kill so many people to preserve life? It is sad &quot;first off that someone or some ones was so uncomfortable with themselves&quot; they had to destroy something so beautiful to so many people. Where does the insanity end? When does the killing end? When will you have enough symbols in your life where you will be happy enough to say here&#39;s what these symbols are kids; this is how you interpret them - but never under any circumstances should you ever let them determine you! You must know that&#39;s all they are is just a way for us to interpret the world and how and what we do with them has a tremendous impact on the world the people the trees the air our whole environment. We all as a people are smart enough to comprehend this. So I urge all of you to take a step back see what the game is that these governments are playing and ask yourself do you want to participate in these horrible and horrific tragedies that have plagued us for so long. We all want to live, we all want to be free we all deserve happiness.\u00a0 All it takes is for you to find you and decide if you still want to play there game.

All &quot;it&quot; &quot;is&quot; is us interpreting these symbols, and trying to organize the chaos we see around us. We have confused ourselves threw language.\u00a0 We have allowed language to define us, to control us, to control our actions in the world we are experiencing threw a means of symbols and the organization of these symbols. We are always trying to improve ourselves, improve the world around us, so what do we do? We destroy the world around us so we can improve the individuals world around them. Is symbols and ideas more important than human life? When will we all have enough symbols in our life where we are content enough with ourselves to finally break out of this loop of insanity that we ourselves have put ourselves threw? When will we all realize life is more than just symbols? An example of this confusion would be science.\u00a0 Science is ones way of interpreting the world around them by means of other people in agreement of that interpretation.\u00a0 Is religion and spirituality not another way of helping one interpret the symbols they feel? We all know in our hearts and in the depths of our souls this can not be real, yet this is our reality. We are living in yesterday cause we&#39;re to focused on tomorrow. Then when tomorrow comes you&#39;re on to the next day and so on and so forth.\u00a0 We need to start living today otherwise you won&#39;t have a tomorrow. We need to start living for life, rather than dying to live. The unfortunate fact is we can only solve this problem threw language.\u00a0 Threw conversation, interaction, and understanding that we are the ones who choose to play the game. So my question to you is what game do you really want to play? Do we all continue like we are? There once was a nation that made the great pyramid, I don&#39;t think they did it by just pure power. They did it with cooperation, and passion.\u00a0 We could be that nation we could be that world! All it takes is better management, and everyone to be on the same page, stop pointing out the differences, stop judging people for the way they interpret this crazy world, and start judging yourself for why it has continued this way. <br>What if culture could progress \ud83d\udc4f just like that? What if one day we all woke up and were aware of ourselves? What if we not only knew what we were doing, but we took charge? It would take us about 2 to 4 years of rigorous work on everyone&#39;s part but we ourselves could automate everything possible there would be few jobs left we could have those be distributed amongst the kids who graduate as there last year of graduation they contribute 1 year of work in honor of all the 1000&#39;s of years their ancestors worked and after that one year they are given a house they are trained on protection of their family and their homes.\u00a0 And they can have a life filled with just happiness and pursuit of living. Rather than having people be bosses over us we could all take pride in our communities and all pitch in to make everyone&#39;s life easier and better. Threw our technology and better management of out resources we could build a better world for future generations. <br>How to stop war? This one is so simple it blew me away when I thought of it. But what is the opposite of war? Peace. And how can war be prevented?\u00a0 Peace very simple all everyone&#39;s needs to do is make a conscious decision to not participate in violence.\u00a0 Just period not fight! If we all made a world where everyone was truly equal, everyone was happy there would be no reason for war. If we stop encouraging these politicians and fighting their war for their benefit they cannot and will not be successful in their pursuit of greed and murder if we all decide we are not partaking in their personal issues.\u00a0 <br>The way we could approach the whole thing to start is by <br>1st- arm and educate all people in gun safety <br>2nd getting everyone fed clothed and in a home. <br>3rd have everyone&#39;s purchases just be accepted. We now more than ever should not take or use more than what&#39;s necessary for the time being. We all need to take a step back.<br>3rd re work our whole economic system, from resources, to to help. We need to find a way to provide everyone with food clothes and shelter. As well as stop destroying the only planet we have. The only other planet that could sustain life is pretty far away.<br>4th\u00a0\u00a0 Automate everything we can to make life as easy as possible for future generations as well as ourselves. <br>5th after we&#39;ve corrected all that we can, we live. We live free. And we live happy.", "comment_date": "2022-03-08T04:34:55Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Adam Niswonger", "comment_text": "The racing line", "comment_date": "2022-03-08T04:33:34Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "GunsmokeZ", "comment_text": "Great video, please don\u2019t use cardboard and sharpie, the noice is just...if you know you know", "comment_date": "2022-03-08T04:32:03Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Young Han", "comment_text": "Digital= experience<br>Analog= wisdom", "comment_date": "2022-03-08T04:30:40Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "baterickpatman", "comment_text": "Seriously one of the best videos yet.

These questions exemplify Veritasium&#39;s (Derek&#39;s) failure to clearly explain the important ideas. Derek constructed (or implied) a false dichotomy between digital and analog. He presents an object and says &quot;this is an analog computer&quot; which to many laypeople will obfuscate what that machine can or can&#39;t do; it&#39;s more like what most people would think of as a calculator (he tries to address this at around 3-4mins but it&#39;s weakly explained especially considering the video&#39;s title: &quot;We&#39;re building Computers Wrong&quot;). A lot of time is wasted on superfluous background info and the history of analog computers in a way that reinforces this false dichotomy by juxtaposing it against the digital computing revolution. I <i>think</i> the point of this video was supposed to be about <i>integrating</i> <b>more</b> analog into our digital systems. If so, the visit to the &quot;analog startup&quot; (Mythic AI) would&#39;ve been great to illustrate <i>how</i> analog tech is relevant to our <i>use</i> of computers today and exactly where and why we&#39;d use it in the future - but also <i>where and why we would NOT.</i> The attempt at making these distinctions is poorly done in this video. It seems like the guy at Mythic AI explaining their product has a <i>far</i> deeper understanding of where this is going and can sense that Derek is misunderstanding something. IMO the biggest single change Derek could have made is to replace almost every instance of &quot;analog computers&quot; with &quot;analog computING.&quot;<br>Derek actually exposes his own misunderstandings when he explains his lifelong bias towards digital over analog; it is perhaps because of his own denigration towards, and prejudice against, analog that this seems so amazing to him. As many people in comments are pointing out, various uses of analog computing already exist. So, is it important that this tech is about to find its way into consumer electronics and no longer be restricted to specialist applications? YES! What does it mean for you though? Your still <i>very</i> digital phone could have an analog card/chip to help with some functions. Motion tracking could be better (and faster), as shown; and a high-end VR gamer setup might need an analog card to play multiplayer competitively. Your home security system could use analog computing in better &#39;understanding&#39; what it sees and might decide not to alert you to that raccoon as it would a human. But all of it is essentially just making some things we already do faster or cheaper, sometimes ever so slightly better, but realistically nothing more. We will <b>NOT</b> be using &quot;analog computers&quot; in place of our digital ones <i>any</i> time soon (probably never). We will <i>not</i> have a proliferation of dominantly analog computers that run digital components. We <i>will</i> <b>continue</b> to have digital computers that run <i>some</i> analog components, but your analog card is gonna be doing more or less what a high-end sound-card does today, just not for sound - instead it&#39;ll be for some other very specific things. If you don&#39;t need one, you&#39;re likely not going to have one - as explained: GPUs remain important for the training processes (among other things). Mythic AI&#39;s flash cells <i>are</i> super cool, but SUPER misleading as presented here! So basically that &quot;analog computer&quot; at the start of the video is gonna be shrunk down to fit inside your typical ATX form-factor (or similar tower PC - still digital) without needing patch-cords or you touching it in any way; just like a GPU! Which to be fair: is AWESOME! But this video does a D- job at explaining it!<br>But does any of this imply we are &quot;building computers wrong?&quot; NO! That is, in fact, some disinformationist clickbait that primes you to be misled (whether purposefully or not). Somehow, after making the clickbait video, almost every following Veritasium video is clickbaity - something about that experience has stuck in Derek&#39;s head and cursed most of his content afterwards. Currently this video sits at 4.199mil views with only 191k likes - that&#39;s <i>depressingly bad.</i> Derek is no longer a science communicator; he is a technology-based entertainer.<br>To Derek, if you are reading this, you have some choices to make. I am 100% sure I&#39;m not your only subscriber considering unsubbing to you. People in my family have already excised you from their science-education content on YouTube for reasons similar to those I&#39;ve outlined above. If the current state of your audience matters to you: prove it - otherwise, you&#39;re gonna lose some of us. You may gain many more in our place; it might be highly profitable!

I think they are quickly going to hit up against density limitations using flash cells (which can only get so small), and A/D converters.  These components are extremely sensitive to noise, whereas digital components are not.  And in fact I think the same results can be achieved using more dedicated digital topologies on current fabs (3nm, 2nm, etc...) and probably at comparable wattages.  What these guys have achieved is amazing, but... I&#39;m skeptical that the methods are capable of scaling in density.<br><br>It is a bit of a misdirection to say that GPUs burn hundreds of watts... that&#39;s only true when you overclock the GPU, and its only true because the architecture is very general purpose (most of the power is burned just shoving data around).  Running a GPU with the correct architecture at lower frequencies... for example, running it at 500MHz instead of 1.5GHz, results in far lower power consumption.  And running a dedicated topology multiplies the density by a huge factor over using a general purpose GPU.<br><br>Another thing about GPUs... the topology doesn&#39;t have to use a fixed bit width.  One can run 16 bits, 12 bits, even 8 bit arithmatic, as well as use iterative loops for that arithmatic instead of fast digital multipliers to increase circuit density and reduce power consumption.<br><br>I think digital is ultimately going to win here.<br><br>-Matt", "comment_date": "2022-03-08T03:59:37Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "TheGregEgg", "comment_text": "Many years ago, The Museum of Science and Industry in Chicago, IL had a running analog computer on display.

One of these approaches is called brain inspired computing or neuromorphic computing.  Same as the brain performs pattern matching, brain inspired computing matches different vectors in a huga space. Then use a similar technique to the one displayed in the video to make all the computations inside the memory (non von-Neumann architecture, My current research focus)<br><br>I am quite excited towards the direction of the research towards the field of innovative computing. There are a lot more ideas which I have not mentioned here. <br>At the end it all comes down to what the industry will implement in the future. They tend to keep the same fabrication line and make small changes to it rather then to replace the entire line of production, so giant leaps are not to be expected anytime soon.

For example, the decision module is supported by summarized tidbits of information processed by the &quot;emotion&quot; module (happy sad angry etc), the &quot;belief&quot; module, the &quot;proposed action&quot; aka &quot;idea&quot; module, the &quot;5 senses&quot; aka &quot;feelings&quot; module (like sight, touch, taste, smell, hearing), the short &amp; long term memory modules, etc. The body has a balance module, a move arm module, a move hand module, a move eyes module, etc. You can read the &quot;state&quot; of each of these modules to help form a &quot;decision&quot; on an &quot;idea&quot; (proposed action). The brain is not as complex as people think it is.  It is a collection of interacting logic modules (systems) that are hardware independent.", "comment_date": "2022-03-07T04:54:12Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "UppityG Livestockian", "comment_text": "Thank you, my pet theory has been given a breath of fresh air.

I was worried at first that this would just be yet another attempt by you to normalize AI (when we should be <b>very concern and cautious</b> with AI).  But, in fact, I was wrong (on this video).  Your video correctly demonstrates a very credible hypothesis, that <b>if</b> we use AI, it can be better done in analog.  Honestly though, even digital systems have to deal with analog and at smaller levels atomic/quantum effects.  So, really, going back to analog - to me, it isn&#39;t really about the past or the future, but more so, it is about realizing we&#39;ve been working in analog this whole time and just better applying it.<br><br>PS:  I highly doubt that AI image recognition is better than average human performance.  I highly doubt humans are in error 5% of the time (especially if we&#39;re previously told what the images are much like much AI is) especially not for more common imagery.  I&#39;ve seen demonstrations of how easily image and facial recognition can be trick.  Surely, it is far superior (and much scarier) than it was in the past, but it has a long way to go to meet or exceed human standards.  Sure, it may be able to catch an image at a faster glance, but I don&#39;t think it has as deep or accurate an understanding of the image.  Also, human being can often be tricked by illusion <b>but</b> they realize it could be an illusion while AI does not know how to tell the difference.<br><br>PPS: Ignoring where I agree or disagree with your video, just looking at it overall, great very interesting video, thanks for posting it!", "comment_date": "2022-03-06T10:34:36Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "James Campbell-Gray", "comment_text": "I ask you one question: Why do crypto-mining systems report all of the &quot;errors&quot; to the network pools, along with all of the &quot;correct&quot; computations of the anonymous ledger?", "comment_date": "2022-03-06T10:33:26Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Christian Horvath", "comment_text": "Another problem could be updating.

In my opinion, there is another large-scale movement besides &quot;analog to digital&quot; in the last 50 years, and it is &quot;from solution-specific systems to general purpose systems&quot;. Of course we do not know how to make &quot;general purpose analog systems&quot; except for the very basic idioms (such are capacitor, resistor, wire, voltage) but in the digital world - we started with specific car-engine-computers, finance-computers, photo-manipulation-computers, typesetting computers etc. towards single-device-that-does-all.  This movement isn&#39;t coincidental, and isn&#39;t even just for ease and comfort (why have 2 devices where 1 can serve both uses). The real importance there is the economy of scale. When you produce a device that can only be sold to 250000 customers - it will remain expensive, and won&#39;t develop much technologically, because there cannot be sufficient return for research investment. But device that sells in hundreds of millions (such are todays leading cellphones) invite unprecedented investment. This is not black-and-white of course, and Apple&#39;s new M1 chip is taking one step back from &quot;general purpose&quot; as many of the functions are now moved to custom-specialized subsystems within the chip. <br><br>What I mean to say is, to become important, Analog computing must pass a threshold of generalization of the usage. There must be Analog building-blocks that can serve enough different purposes, as to drive the economy of scale, and fit into hundreds of millions of devices. Google&#39;s old-fashion GPU farms are virtually unimportant for this process - because there are so few of them. This startup in Texas may be selling to Google good and cheap GPU replacements, but that&#39;s not a start of any industry. <br><br>I&#39;m old enough to remember the &quot;Analog electronics&quot; era, and still use an analog Audio system (yes, including a turntable and tube-amplifiers and all that) and being a musician I can certainly appreciate the analog sound of my Piano over its digital recording and manipulation. I&#39;m not &quot;against analog&quot; - only I think something fundamental must change, and that will only happen when some electrical engineer will step out of the digital brain-washing machine in the academy and industry, and will come up with a real new idea about flexible analog systems.", "comment_date": "2022-03-06T06:59:41Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Smooth Mercenary", "comment_text": "<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GVsUOuSjvcg&amp;t=12m48s\">12:48</a> So...these are the guys responsible for the spark that led to the increase in GPU prices.

Analog systems can be used as building blocks for any body you are able to work with them.

It is thus digital data. While the digital computer is digital data computing, the computer itself relies on some analog process to facilitate the digital data processing. Integration of analog data processing does and can be done. Making an analog core processor that is not hybrid would need inbuilt redundancies. A 1% error level is not true because error checking methods can be built into an analog system much like digital bit correction can be built into a digital data processing system .

This means to increase the complexity and accuracy you increase the number of neurons/nodes.  Alternatively you could use feedback loops which more accurately represents how brains work.  When identifying something visually it is not yes or no, you resolve it over a second or two (typically) which increasing accuracy.  You can almost instantly identify the existance of possible threats but not the details of what they are.  This is a mixture of receiving enough sensorory data and processing it.  The more time taken in processing data , the more feedbacks can be used and less neurons/nodes needed.  However the complexity of iterative networks of neurons is mind-boggling, but that will be a significant step up on processing sensory data.  Also the same applies to the receiving of sensory data; you can constantly receive small but key data that can alert whether to collect more data (just like the alexa/siri word detection), and over time you collect finer details and the processing deems it necessary.  This is working in the limitation of the processing power available (eg small brain or large brain) and how to distribute data collection with data processing and the power used.  The simplification used in your video that can be relexed is that the neuron outputs ones or zeros; nerons release many chemical signals of different strengths, and some axons branch that reach multiple destination neurons.

My one niggling doubt is the fact there is no such thing as error correction for analog devices. There are sources of noise that screw with the output of analog devices that digital devices are good enough at error correcting to take into account. So, I imagine for something like autonomous cars you will need both to make sure the behavior is always on point. I work quite a bit with analog devices, so know there are big challenges to get an analog system to behave how you expect 100% of the time. It might be good enough for certain tasks where there is low risk and you have certain constraints for energy use, space, etc. But for autonomous cars the difference between having something that works 100% of the time and 99.9% of the time is a lot of people dying. I assume, however, that Mythic has thought about this when designing.

There are all kinds of things that can affect electronics to change voltage levels and currents slightly, or sometimes even in large ways, over time.  One of the huge benefits to digital logic (and actually why it was first developed) is that it makes it possible to distinguish, at a low level, between correct values and invalid conditions, and know reliably whether the device is functioning as intended or not.<br><br>In a digital computer, if a &quot;1&quot; is 5 volts and a &quot;0&quot; is 0 volts, those are the only valid possibilities (within certain margins).  If a logic line ends up with 2.5 volts or -5 volts, those are obviously fault conditions and will usually cause things like crashes, and stop processing altogether.  But if a value in an analog computer is supposed to be 5V but ends up 2.5V, or even -5V, it will just come up with a different answer than it should, with no indication of a problem at all.  When reliability is particularly important, the precision of digital computing also allows conclusive checking to make sure things are actually still correct (parity/ECC codes, etc), which you can&#39;t really do with analog values either.  This is particularly an issue with anything intended to operate for long periods of time, because electronic components and operating conditions change over time, so even if it started out doing the right thing reliably, there&#39;s no guarantee it will stay that way over the long term.<br><br>As a direct example, the analog matrix multiplication chip towards the end, I would suspect is actually far far more sensitive to external electrical or magnetic fields than any traditional computer.  The digital equivalents are, yes, much larger and less efficient, but also likely much more resilient to real-world conditions, which is often important.<br><br>Some of this can sometimes be dealt with by simply &quot;over-engineering&quot; things (for example, having two, three, or more of each computer doing the same calculations at the same time and comparing the results to make sure they match), but that can also reduce some of the touted benefits (simplicity, efficiency) as well, so the benefits of analog computing often don&#39;t end up being as large as they might seem at first, for many applications.", "comment_date": "2022-03-05T21:49:34Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Gregor Samsa", "comment_text": "Thats all nonsense.

The ADC (analog-to-digital converter) is a power hungry component that has limits in terms of bit resolution which gets worse with increasing frequency. For example, a 1-ghz 8-bit ADC (considered top of the line) allows you to convert an analog signal to an 8 bit digital number at a speed of 1 ghz - BUT only 8 bits\u2026 So if you\u2019re summing say sixteen 8 bit numbers together as part of the matrix multiply and accumulate, you would expect to end up with a 12-bit wide result (e.g. 255 x 16 = 4080 which requires at least 12 bits to represent). If your ADC is only 8 bits, then you\u2019re losing some of that resolution! <br><br>Either way, you have got to respect the creativity and ingenuity from the folks at Mythic.

Livingston McPherson", "comment_text": "Here&#39;s some more detail from an AI researcher perspective that Derek had to skip over:<br><br>1. (on <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GVsUOuSjvcg&amp;t=4m15s\">4:15</a> and <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GVsUOuSjvcg&amp;t=20m08s\">20:08</a> ) Neurons actually exhibit non-digital characteristics. Checkout all the complex chemical and enzyme interactions simulated in &quot;Neuromorphic engineering&quot;: these are the researchers seriously pursuing bio-inspired artificial neurons.<br>2. As such, the perceptron has always been a crude model of real neurons and neural network engineering since then has only made it diverge further. For example, we have replaced the digital thresholding on the matrix multiplication with either just passing it straight on (linear gates) or rounding negative values up to zero (rectified linear gates, called ReLu for short). At this point the name &quot;neural&quot; network is a bit misleading, so most practitioners treat it as a vestigial name rather than a real parallel. Introducing modern neural networks via the shaky biomimetic parallel invites the kinds of &quot;artificial brain&quot; rhetoric that hyped AI into the first AI winter.<br>3. (on <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GVsUOuSjvcg&amp;t=12m18s\">12:18</a>) As Derek says, what AlexNet added was greater depth and way more neurons. Therefore, the jury is out on whether the AlexNet breakthrough, and its ensuing deep learning revolution, was from the neural network structure itself or from the sheer adjustable depth of the network that AlexNet brought. There are many successful learning algorithms that get comparable performance to neural networks just by going deep even when discarding the neural network structure. For example, check out how even simple linear controllers can beat neural networks in the research from Ben Recht&#39;s group at UC Berkeley<br>4. (on <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GVsUOuSjvcg&amp;t=13m20s\">13:20</a> ) The fact that they are &quot;performing better than human labeling&quot; when the ImageNet data comes from human labels suggests that the AI is fitting to information beyond the tolerance of the data. This fitting to match noise (termed &quot;overfitting&quot; for short) is characteristic of deeply parametrized learning models. By overfitting the AI generally only works well on the dataset and can&#39;t generalize what it&#39;s learned to new cases. Therefore, the standard in deep learning application is to secure quite large datasets and keep the AI working only within conditions like those in the training set. Though we hope for AI to intelligently extend to novel situations, that transfer has yet to materialize. The closest we&#39;ve got is just rapidly gathering more data live when we&#39;re placed in a new scene, which we can prep for via &quot;meta-learning&quot; (see Chelsea Finn&#39;s research)<br><br>Combining points 3 and 4, it&#39;s my opinion that the advances in deep AI comes from bigger data sets (thanks to people like Fei Fei Li) and having more tunable parameters to fit this data. *Big data and robust computation are the game changers*. We AI researchers really owe a lot of our success to the systems engineers and database managers who brought that heat.", "comment_date": "2022-03-05T19:35:59Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Luk\u00e1\u0161 Horn\u00edk", "comment_text": "sracka", "comment_date": "2022-03-05T19:35:03Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Adrian Galilea", "comment_text": "Writing on the cardboard almost made me close the video lol", "comment_date": "2022-03-05T19:32:11Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Carlos A.

This life is temporary once you die you spend eternity in one of two places so choose heaven or hell. Jesus loved you to die for you. He says you all are valuable if you turn from your sins he will bless you like never before and he wants to call you son and daughter but whenever you sin you choose hell and choose to hate God. Now you may say I&#39;m a good person which is actually not true (Mark 10:18). But did you know that not even forgiving others is enough to send you to hell. Jesus is very serious about sin in fact Jesus says most people go to hell and few enter heaven (Mathew <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GVsUOuSjvcg&amp;t=7m13s\">7:13</a>-14). No sin is worth going to hell for when someone goes to hell you can never escape your there forever and you will feel the pain forever . It&#39;s not worth it You can live in heaven forever where Jesus serves you food and you can be in God&#39;s presence forever where you&#39;re never sad or depressed and have a mansion as well. There is Good news If you come to Jesus humbly and confess your sins and beg him for mercy and forgiveness he will forgive you. But you can&#39;t continue to willfully sin (Hebrews 10:26) Because Jesus also says if you love me keep my commandments (John 14:15) you immediately need to repent from all your sins (Luke 13:3) and follow up with Jesus. Remember Follow Jesus only no religion no man Jesus rose from the dead. We have 500 eyewitnesses of it. Jesus is coming back soon with no mercy, seek the lord now while he may be found.

Yes, it takes tremendous resources (in compute time AND in storage of training data and such) to train a large neural network.  You need a datacenter, pretty much.  But to RUN the neural net?  To use it to get answers?  You can run that on a potato.  Once you have the weights... that&#39;s all you need.  Then each use is just a big matrix multiplication.  ALL of the problems you outline have a solution... it&#39;s not analog.  It&#39;s 1 device:  the memristor.  Producing them in large quantity is still challenging, as they were only proven to exist a handful of years ago.  But, if we can master their manufacturing the way we have with transistors.... well, literally everything is going to change.  They were hypothesized to exist as the 4th &#39;fundamental circuit element&#39; in the 1970s.  And now we know they do exist, and we can make them.  And in operation they behave like a resistor with a memory.  So when current passes through it in one direction, their resistance increases.  When current passes through it in the opposite direction, resistance decreases.  Using this it is possible to reproduce everything in modern computers using only a grid of memristors.  Memory, CPU, anything.  Imagine an FPGA which can be reprogrammed faster than any cache memory on a CPU die can change state.  Oh, and it is non-volatile.  It need not remain powered or be refreshed to retain its resistance level.  All data storage, all CPUs, all GPUs, all FPGAs, everything can be replaced by just a gigantic grid of memristors.  AND they do MORE than that.  Since they basically act a hell of a lot like a neuron, there is a ton of research being done into &quot;neuromorphic computing&quot; which doesn&#39;t seek to emulate circuits but, instead, brains.  Memristors function somewhat like neurons.  I find that much less interesting than the OTHER thing they can do... they can&#39;t just function as CPU or memory... they can change what they are functioning as nearly instantaneously.  This makes possible completely unthinkable algorithms.  Algorithms where compute units literally exist electrically directly connected to memory holding the data they are operating on, and changing whether they store data or execute computations in realtime.  Data locality on the chip becomes as important as the value being stored, computing &quot;moving&quot; around the grid computing by creating paths to and setting the values it needs.  It is an utterly bizarre and fundamentally different mean of computation, and we don&#39;t know anything about what it might make possible.  It required a lot of ground-up reworking of all existing computing concepts.<br><br>If you can&#39;t tell, I&#39;m pretty excited for these things.<br><br>edit:  wtf?  You dive right into memristors, which are NOT an analog computing model at all, after setting it up to claim analog computers will be significant in the future.  Obviously I commented in my excitement before finishing the video.  Sorry about that.  But you undersold memristors and classing them as analog just isn&#39;t right.  Current either flows or it does not, which is digital.  But that&#39;s getting a bit into semantics.  We already COULD have extremely low power devices doing ALL voice recognition.  And it could be adaptive and actually work BETTER and not require an Internet connection.  That&#39;s already a cakewalk.  The reason your Google Home or Amazon Echo sends every word you say to a datacenter is NOT because it is computationally expensive to recognize and process your voice.  The reason it does it is purely and totally for business reasons.  By processing your speech, they get to collect data on you.  If the little bit of computation needed was done on the device itself?  It would cut them, and the advertisers they sell your data to, out of the loop.  It would destroy their business model.  It&#39;s the same reason you don&#39;t see videos the recommendation algorithm thinks YOU will like, your tastes are balkanized into a group and you&#39;re shown what the algorithm determines your GROUP likes.  If recommenders ran locally in your browser instead of in the cloud, it would be easy, they could have infinite memory, but it would give YOU the data and there&#39;d be no reason to send it off to advertiser-friendly balkanizing algorithms that can&#39;t handle the idea of &#39;individuals&#39;.", "comment_date": "2022-03-05T01:12:43Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Guts", "comment_text": "This might be the most important video you\u2019ve ever made", "comment_date": "2022-03-05T01:11:20Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Thomas", "comment_text": "What happened to the 1% error rate with analog transistors though?

Then you&#39;d simply combine those together with what amounts to a fancy mixer - like a DJ would audio mix two sounds together - to get one &quot;audio&quot; signal, with 12 voice calls at the same time, each one 4kHz higher - up on beyond the range of human hearing. To imagine what it &quot;sounded&quot; like, imagine you are listening to a normal voice speaking at the same time as another voice with the pitch increased to make it a bit squeeky, and then a third to make it REALLY squeeky, and another higher one, and so on beyond your range of hearing.<br>It sounded pretty wierd!<br>So then, you take that &quot;audio&quot;, and another 3 and do the same again - but this time the second one is modulated by a 96kHz signal, the third by a one yet 96kHz higher than than, and so on.<br>That gives you a mega-&quot;squeeky&quot; audio signal with 48 audio signals, each 4kHz higher than the previous one.<br><br>This massive analog signal was called a &quot;supertrunk&quot;. You could then combine another supertrunk the same way to get two combined (at least on that system).<br>You then just vibrate a microwave radio frequency with the massive analog supertrunks - usually a 4gHz or 8gHz signal.<br><br>But obviously, you can only fire a line-of-sight microwave beam just so many miles before the curvature of the earth became a problem, or just attenuation as that signal diffracted nicely over hills etc.<br>So you&#39;d put a repeater which just rebroadcast the single supertrunk signal out of one analog output from the radio and straight into the other.<br>And each repeater added noise and a degree of distortion.<br><br>NOW.<br>The &quot;noise floor&quot; of this system on a single link of 30-odd miles was literally around -78dBM.<br>For you audio freaks, that means we were beaming literally hundreds of phone calls (albeit, limited to an upper audio frequency of about 3.4kHz, so it was pretty AM quality frequency-wise) with the noise of a VERY high quality LP or cassette tape WITH Dolby B, C, S or even DBX switched on (all you Tascam freaks might remember that stuff - good times, good times.)<br>HOWEVER, each repeater site to get it across the murky UK air would add around 6-9DB more noise. By the time it got from London to the other side of Oxfordshire, you&#39;d be lucky to hear anyone at the other end.<br><br>Now the other system was digital - you just digitise the audio, and stack the channels up one bit at a time, more or less, one after the other time wise until you get all 8 bits.<br>But its noise floor was -45dBM. It sounded like a bad 8-track tape...but with AM radio broadcasting over it... but it sounded that &quot;good&quot; for literally thousands of miles.<br><br>No real point to this convo except to say that for many applications, the tech of the 1950s/60s in purely analog worked extremely well...to a point.

In the case of AI inference implementation, the idea is pretty much the same as the Mythic chips shown: take a trained model and implement it in hardware. While FPGAs aren&#39;t analog in the sense that the output is determined by measuring the current flow, it can be thought of pretty much as if you built a physical circuit with logic gates that represents the trained model. This is almost always going to be way faster than a digital system because there is no memory access time, no putting values in registers and waiting for the ALU to perform an operation, etc. The speed limit is up to the propagation delay of the logic gates. (Yes, I know this is a fairly gross oversimplification, but hopefully it gets the basic idea across). As a matter of fact, Google and Amazon already have FPGAs as part of their cloud services to accelerate certain workloads. The main thing that currently prevents them from being much more widely implemented is the fact that there is no good method for FPGA virtualization. Cloud services (and increasingly pretty much all general purpose computers, but especially cloud services) rely on the ability to virtualize hardware so that many virtual machines can share it, but FPGAs are much harder to do this with, especially when you need to be able to dynamically change the &quot;circuit&quot; in the FPGA when switching between processes during execution.

So his description of an analog computer is just a very simplified digital computer. <br>His &quot;analog&quot; computer is just an example of how digital computing got its start. Where the transistors were large switches which controlled the voltage inputs. His statement that to add two 8 bit numbers you need around 50 transisters is misleading. In computing, arithmetic is done via an ALU circuit pattern. And while modern ones use a fair amount of transistors that&#39;s only because modern computers have built in error correction. If all you want is to add two numbers and you don&#39;t care about any of the bells and whistles it takes a fraction of the circuit components to do that. Also, computers are exceedingly efficient at specifically this.

Analog computers are NOT fast - they are limited by the bandwidths and settling times of their operational amplifiers, which are far slower than the digital arithemetic processors that are used to solve the same problems digitally.  They are NOT &quot;incredibly powerful&quot; - there has to be a separate circuit for each element in the problem, each term of the differential equation being solved.  Analog computer circuits can&#39;t multitask; once you&#39;ve used up all of the circuits, you can&#39;t simulate anything more complex.  You can only expand the problem by adding more circuits.  Modern digital simulations can easily solve the problems that the toy he is demonstrating can, and CAN display these in real time as well.  But as soon as you add one more term to the equation, the digital simulation slows down ever so slightly (as a factor of how much the complexity has increased), while the analog system simply cannot continue.  And then there&#39;s repeatability.  The digital simulation can be repeated, and will produce exactly the same results again.  This is just not possible with analog computers.  With analog computers, there are errors introduced by electrical noise in the components, and changes in the circuit characteristics with temperature.  These make it difficult to achieve even a 0.1% accuracy and repeatability.  He mentions 1% in the video, which is what low-cost analog is good for.  In contrast, the accuracy of a 64-bit arithmetic unit is two parts in 10^-19, which is less than one part per million million million.  And absolutely repeatable. <br><br>And then he talks about power, and makes an implied connection between the number of transistors and the power required.  This isn&#39;t even close to correct.  The size of transistors used in microprocessors, and their power requirement per transistor, is microscopic compared with that of the transistors required by analog computers to achieve even their limited capabilities.<br><br>Then he moves on to neural nets (e.g., the Perceptron).  Again, MUCH easier to implement digitally than with analog circuits.  In fact, the weighted sum example he gives is a perfect case to apply a GPU to.  And digital circuitry scales down in size (and power) much better than does analog.<br><br>Oh!  Wait a moment!  You know how figures never lie, but liars always figure?  The chart he shows for the improvement over time of neural nets over time has a huge red flag: the chart does not start its vertical axis at zero.  This is a common way of skewing data, because it makes changes near the bottom of the chart look more significant than they are.  BAD science.  And his assertion that analog circuits can be scaled up to the level needed for this sort of neural net is misguided at best.  As I said, you can&#39;t get the same kind of analog performance out of a nanometer-scale transistor that you can in a digital application.  The notion that you can get an accurate analog multiplication out of a flash memory cell is just fantasy.  And sure, you can afford some loss of accuracy in neural nets, but let&#39;s not pretend that you get the kind of accuracy the digital net can out of these.<br><br>This is misinformation, simple and clear.", "comment_date": "2022-03-04T05:12:06Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "jama211", "comment_text": "Stop it with the false clickbait titles.

Socionics is a system of personality types and their interactions. They have &#39;information elements,&#39; the types of information that exist out there in the world. I myself use &#39;introverted sensing,&#39; and so I think about things like how would you program a computer to do that. Some aspects of introverted sensing include how objects interact with each other, and I like to think of the Sesame Street song, sung by Grover, &#39;Over, Under, Around, and Through.&#39; Can you teach a computer about those interactions, those prepositions? You don&#39;t have to teach it what the objects are, you only have to teach it that some sort of object is there, which means, teach it topology. There is some blob-shaped thing, which is smaller than the background image. If the blob-shaped thing includes a bunch of other objects inside it, then it&#39;s the background. How do the objects interact with the other objects? Knowing what the objects are isn&#39;t important, just distinguishing between background and object is important, and then seeing how they interact is important. In humans, introverted sensing is used for something like, for example, skiing. You have to ski down the hill, avoid crashing into a tree, avoid crashing into other skiers, avoid interacting with slippery ice, try to interact with snow that has the desired texture, avoid going over moguls. A racecar driver also has to use this. It doesn&#39;t matter so much if you can tell the difference between a Ford and a Honda, all that matters is that you avoid bumping into the object, so that means, you have to understand how objects interact with other objects, and how they interact with the background image.

To be say used i a court of law there must be no room for error nor disagreement, nor a unsure of the charge in any one of the 12 strong jury, if there is a room for doubt the charges are null and void, and the case can proceed no further. It must be a 12 man agreement with any room for errr. If your predictions are to be taken as corect, you must allow for all posibilities and possible outcomes, by ignoring or not including a known vaiable in the calc, then its not 100%. Ie the facial recognition, its a bias method of using a data base, which need human input, which retirns one or more posibile matching pictures. But a true match must be 10\u201d% with no options no other posible persons face pic, if it can not return a one for one exact match then the algorytmns have failed otr not been programmed with a full set of pos variables. Which means the assumption its AI is total bogus and is data base crunching using 3d noobs, to match up across the face. Ny variation on the out put other than one to one is a fail.

You can really affect the States in an analog fashion. What seems fixed is now static. And what was one static can become fixed. It&#39;s kind of like when I think of how guys think a robot programmer is really genius but as the popularity the popularity or the supply of programmers goes up in the factories they will soon become just like Burger flippers pizza delivery drivers and machine operators loading materials.<br> I think of how fanuc robotics, abb, nachi.. Any of these industrial applications of robots they are all X86 they are all very simple brains they are really dumb really if you really know it then you know they are dumb.<br> It&#39;s just like music equipment.<br> When I tore apart the MPC 2000 in the nineties  I laughed and cried at how stupid it was and how much it cost.<br> I was determined to make something better and way more powerful and I did I just couldn&#39;t or didn&#39;t take the time to do a screen it was all very easy and a lot control. It was solid state really. Because I was using voltages.  Resistances I had 555 timer chips. I was creating oscillation and sequence I was locking and latching.<br> All I had to do is multiply just like a mixer for audio tracks. I just had to do the same thing over and over and eventually I had 64 banks. But I had like what we have today as what is called the launch pad.<br> I had my own launchpad in 1994.<br> Long before it ever existed.<br> Except the difference was that it was not digital controlling a computer to make the sounds happen.<br> It had it all stored in each button had its own chip.<br> That was holding 5 seconds of audio.<br> So it was fragmented.

Maybe you should get a degree in EE before posting this nonsense. The entire reason why digital design is there is precisely because we don&#39;t need to deal with the much stricter standards needed for analog design where very precise tolerances are needed. If you only need to deal with 2 Voltages (HIGH and LOW), the transistor characteristics are less of a factor and only need to operate within the respective envelopes (which are pretty large mind you) in order to be used. Furthermore other things (like wire inductance, resistance and capacitance) need to be strictly characterized in order to design your circuit. Transistors characteristics also need to be very strictly measured as gate capacitance and leakage current all need to be strictly characterized in order to use it as an analog computer.<br><br>Every single EE student is taught about the reasons we learn to design digital circuits in our digital circuits classes. Of course it would be preferable if we could use multiple bits per transistor. Just using 4 bits per transistor would shrink designs radically and decrease costs radically. However, in order to do so would require cost prohibitive increases in manufacturing as almost every nanowire and transistor would need to meet precise specifications, and would also be highly imprecise as there would be enough perturbance due to natural factors (like temperature increases, humidity and radiation loads) where the systems would be mostly unreliable.<br><br>For anyone else, let the engineers working on your chips do their jobs. If there was a better way of doing it, they would have clearly done so as the cost implications would be massive. The reasons chips are built the way they are is so they can remain robust and produce results reliably. As someone with a degree in electrical engineering, I find the implications of this video frankly appalling.

I&#39;m a little surprised you didn&#39;t mention quantum computers as a type of analog computer, though I hadn&#39;t thought of them like that myself until watching this.<br><br>My background is a mix of software and hardware engineering, but I expect analog computation to stay fairly niche for the foreseeable future. Digital is just too good of a fit for the majority of our simple and mostly mechanical needs, and most computer engineering jobs don&#39;t require the types of advanced mathematical skills needed for analog systems. In the digital world, any system can be built from just NAND and NOR gates, built upon boolean algebra and layered with enough abstractions to enable us to do very useful things.<br><br>That being said, we definitely need analog computing techniques too and rely on them heavily for communications systems. I think the way we &quot;are building computers wrong&quot; is by taking that one size fits all approach. The kind of analog computing work you highlighted is incredibly impressive, but is heavily academic and requires greater math skills than most of us have on the commercial side.<br><br>Additionally, I think we will see some revolutionary ideas come about on the digital side too. I think what we need to push THAT forward is an open source boom in hardware similar to what open source did for software in the 90s. My expectation is that as Moore&#39;s Law and Von Neumann architecture hits its ceiling, we&#39;ll be moving into more creative digital approaches as we can&#39;t just rely on next year&#39;s computers being cheaper and faster.

Just like the other forces it is not something you can grab or touch, you can only see its effects on the world around us. Consciousness can interact with this reality by converting information into colors and smells, by interpreting the three dimensional web of information that is lit up from our physical brains. It seems to be a specific pattern in which consciousness can interpret, for example, your eyes detect a wavelength of light, enough proteins are activated by this energy to be able to polarize or depolarize a single cell. If enough of these cells go off it sends a Cascade of polarization and depolarization as well as chemical reactions down a set of neural networks, eventually it splits off at a few places in the Brain before it reaches the far back of your brain, where it really explodes into this beautiful three-dimensional pattern of energy.<br><br>This pattern can be interpreted by consciousness as the color red. Red is not something that exists in the physical universe, only can consciousness envision this color based on what our brains tell it. Imagine the colors that we cannot experience due to our brain and our eye structure in which only accepts three wavelengths. <br><br>In the end, what you are right now, in this very moment is a force that is utilizing a brain to be able to experience time and space. Without this body consciousness cannot interpret the rate of time nor can it process any information. So an eternity, quintillions of years can zip by in an instant and you wouldn&#39;t be aware of it. There is only one consciousness, and it&#39;s you. It is also me. It is also that spider in the corner of your room, it is also your siblings and your family, it is everything that is capable of transmitting information in such a way where consciousness can utilize it to experience something.<br><br>The reason why we feel we are individuals is because consciousness is experiencing what that individual brain is experiencing, that brain is loaded with physical information in which gives it its unique experience, an individualistic experience from a very unique perspective of the universe. While you are experiencing this individual being you will notice that there are other individual beings that feel they are separate from you. Imagine if you will a giant aquarium full of water, you make a little bubble inside and inside that bubble is a little bit of water vapor. You are the water, the bubble is your physical body and that water vapor is you, but separated from yourself experiencing what the bubble experiences. I am saying that we are all the exact same consciousness, from that species 50 billion light years away, to the ant just outside your wall.<br><br>But it doesn&#39;t just simply stop at organic beings, if we are capable of building a complex enough machine with just the right amount of information, this new pattern will provide electrical energy to surge throughout it creating three-dimensional patterns of energy, just as our brain does the exact same thing using electrochemical processes, this pattern may eventually be able to be interpreted by consciousness if not already. <br><br>But remember that everything I am saying is simply a hypothetical, obviously I am completely wrong because no one in this universe as far as we know understands the complexities of this reality. All we know is that we are here and alive, and the universe is 0.000000001% old. <br><br>I almost feel like the instant we die we open our new senses as a whole new species on a whole different planet, smart or simplistic, for a new experience with a unique perspective of the universe, and this process repeats.<br><br>Maybe on the other side all we have is our imagination and it is limited by our experiences, so we can only imagine so much before we become bored of it, assuming we could even be bored in such a place, of course even assuming that it exists in which it probably doesn&#39;t, or does.<br><br>Only The dead know, or not", "comment_date": "2022-03-03T01:07:08Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Shadydoesit", "comment_text": "What if ternary gaming pc", "comment_date": "2022-03-03T01:03:08Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Nick Carter", "comment_text": "When I went to college for EE degree, the only computers they had for us to play with  were analog, and digital circuits and logic were not taught.

Neurons in the human brain have far more connections, and said connections are far more complex. There are feedback loops, and research has even shown that there is way more going on than just the neurons &quot;firing&quot;, right down to tiny chemical reactions happening throughout the cells, which all influence the &quot;output&quot;. In short, ANNs are <i>very loosely</i> based on any biological structure, and their shortcomings clearly reflect that. And while we made a lot of advancements, it is still an open question whether we can go further, or if we&#39;re just optimizing a few extra percents on a plateau.<br><br>2) Generally speaking, when discussing AI, one must keep in mind that underneath all the fancy tech buzzwords, what they are doing is simply data association. They are essentially giant bags of database entries that say things like &quot;when you see this pattern of pixels, it&#39;s 57% likely to be a dog&quot;. This is putting it very crudely, of course, but the point is that they don&#39;t do anything magical, and certainly not anything analogous to &quot;thinking&quot;, not any more than when cruise control adjusts the throttle based on the speed of the car. It just <i>seems</i> like it&#39;s &quot;intelligence&quot; because it performs tasks that are (or at least look like) the kind of thing humans do.<br><br>It was refreshing to hear the researcher in the video mention something like a detector on an assembly line. This is an underrated role for such systems, i.e optimizing performance in controlled environments. Machines work best in environments that humans can design for specific tasks. The &quot;natural world&quot; is far too noisy and uneven, and you need far more effort to make a machine work reliably in it.<br><br>3) The ImageNet achievements, while impressive, also ended up creating an overly optimistic attitude that has led to quite a few harsh reality checks (bordering on another &quot;AI winter&quot;). As it turns out, simply figuring out labels for images is a relatively easy task, and even <i>that</i> took decades to improve to this extent. Once you go beyond that level, you need exponentially more data, and even the tiniest error rate can lead to critical failures. The problem these days is that a lot of researchers and big companies can just brute force a better ImageNet score and claim that they made &quot;improvements&quot;, when in reality the networks are now just &quot;better at ImageNet&quot; (i.e overly specialized on a task that isn&#39;t directly useful in any real-life application).<br><br>4) Related to 3), the difference between 96% and 99% confidence that an image is a chicken is anything but trivial. And let&#39;s not even get into adversarial problems, where an image that is actually just a seemingly random mess of pixels is also classified by the network with 99% confidence as &quot;a chicken&quot;. Indeed, when all you&#39;re doing is just assigning labels to images, this isn&#39;t a huge issue, but in any critical system where you <i>must not</i> make mistakes, it&#39;s a much greater issue. And this becomes even worse when those few percents of error are a symptom of bigger flaws under the hood.<br><br>5) The power consumption of training neural networks cannot be overstated, and I am very glad Derek made it one of the key points of his video. This is another domain in which biological neurons humiliate computer science, as our brains can perform countless operations using a fraction of a fraction of the power of computers attempting to do the same tasks. With that in mind, advancements such as the analog matrix multiplication chips are very welcome indeed. <br><br>Probably worth pointing out that it&#39;s not a (pardon the pun) binary choice. Both analog and digital components would have their roles, with the former providing speed and simplicity, while the latter offers reliability and ease of programming.

The issues Derek mentions at <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GVsUOuSjvcg&amp;t=13m40s\">13:40</a> could use some re examination. And by some I mean a lot.<br>1. The entire schtick with &quot;neural nets consume a lot of energy&quot; is overblown by AI Ethics people, and I hate that it is getting mainstream because influencers pick up on the congnitively simple argument. Training a billion parameter model is no more expensive than it is to host content on any social media platforms. We don&#39;t worry about energy consumption when watching this video do we?<br><br>2. This is the only argument that made sense to me, because moving tensors to and from memory is the bottleneck for ML training. While the effects are negligible at smaller models, when you&#39;re training models hundreds of billions of parameters the effect is significant enough to warrant years of research in improving communication hardware. See: NVLink, NVSwitch, Infiniband. I don&#39;t know how much more performance can be hypothetically squeezed out of a DGX-A100 if we quadrupled it&#39;s bandwidth magically.<br><br>3. Moore&#39;s law: another bait. Supposedly the Moore&#39;s law has been &quot;dying&quot; for at least two decades now. We are still at 7nm architectures when working with hardware specialized for neural net training. We can go all the way down to 3nm, maybe even 1nm. So there&#39;s still a ways to go. Secondly, while Moore&#39;s original law was pertaining to the number of transistors on an IC, it is in no way limiting the fact that we can keep squeezing more compute per square mm out of a chip. 3D architectures and using electromagnetic waves instead of electrons for operations are avenues that will practically remove any computational barriers for the next couple of decades. Even now, while the number of transistors may closely follow Moore&#39;s law of doubling every two years, compute possible from a chip exceeds Moore&#39;s law significantly. And ultimately, the only thing we care about is compute, not pushing the transistors into ever tinier spaces. It just so happens that doing the latter achieves the former.

I added pushbuttons and individual wires for two sets of ten adjustable clips, replacing the single wire and clip that was moved along each of two resistive wires adjacent to a meter stick shown in the poster. I described this for the Science Fair project I entered as a &quot;Digital Computer&quot;. My thinking was that the pushbuttons were activated with  the digits at the  end of our arms. <br>Although other students at other schools had entered a simple copy of the poster illustration, mine won that year&#39;s blue ribbon for the category.

All the doors are closed to me, even the eyes of God are blind to see the oppression that is being done to me, and the ears of God are blind to hearing the cries of my constant cries, my midnight cries, my daily sufferings, my daily prayers and the jurists and The cries of my every moment from this oppression, oppression and cruelty that from the beginning of my life, fromThe first events of my life that I remember are deaf. So how can I hope for others when God has done nothing for me and trapped me in a cruel, cruel, cruel, and oppressive family? I am Morteza, I am from Iran, I am blind, I am 34 years old, I am unemployed because in our country, Iran, there is no work for healthy people, let alone disabled people like me. I live with my family in a small town in Iran. Of course, in appearance, they are my family, but in reality, they see me as their own enemy, and with me, who am their child, only bI was born blind, and I was not to blame for this, but my parents, because they were illiterate, considered me as a disgrace only to myself for my blindness and disability, and were always tortured as severely as possible. They beat me to the point where they threatened me with a knife. They put me to sleep and put the knife on my neck, and I was terrified and scared. Get up and until fullThe thin skin of my hand burned, they would not let me go. And they tortured me many, many times, to the point that my brothers, with the support of my parents, tortured me in front of my parents&#39; indifferent eyes, and told me that I was blind. You are and you should be tortured to the extent that they created the belief in me and in my mind that anyone who is blind or disabled should be tortured because it is a disgrace to the family and society. And unfortunately, their torture is still going on, and only a kind of tortureThey do not consider it for him, so how can I complain to someone who considers my law as his property, of course, the current laws in Iran. Unfortunately, the government does not have a place for people like me to go and live. I really have no choice, either I have to commit suicide or I have to stay in the same house that my family has turned into hell for me, under the severe mental and physical torture that my family inflicts on me. And more than ever with a horrible gradual death that tormentedI want to stay.

We\u2019ve lied, we\u2019ve stolen, we\u2019ve sinned sexually, and we\u2019ve taken His name in vain; which makes us liars, thieves, fornicators and blasphemers ... Yet this is only four of our many transgressions .<br><br>The problem is, we can never \u2018outweigh\u2019 our sin with good works because God is perfect in Holiness, meaning his standard is beyond our reach. He is also perfect in Justice, meaning, he will bring EVERY sin to light. The punishment for our sin is death, and Hell; a place of Eternal Fire, where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth .<br><br>Fortunately God is also perfect in Love; so 2000 years ago, he left his throne in heaven, and came to earth as a man named Jesus Christ. While here, he lived a perfectly righteous life, only to take the punishment that We deserved; Our sinless creator became our sin, and endured a gruesome death on a cross. In doing so, his blood was shed to wash us clean of our transgressions .<br>Right before he died, he said \u2018it is finished\u2019 .. meaning, the debt for our sins has been paid in full. And on the third day, he defeated death and rose from the grave. So now, we can go free from the wrath of God\u2019s judgement not by earning it, but rather, as a free gift of grace ..<br><br>Except gifts can be either accepted or rejected. So this is what you must do in response ; <br><br>Humbly admit to God that you have sinned against him. Then, confess with your mouth that Jesus Christ is Lord, and your Savior. ( Romans 10:9 ) . <br><br>Do this, and you will be saved .<br><br>If you do so sincerely, God will grant you a new heart which no longer finds comfort in sin, but instead desires to read and obey his word, the holy bible. He will also grant you Eternal life in his presence; The greatest pleasure on earth doesn\u2019t even come close to what God is preparing for believers in the afterlife .<br><br>You\u2019ve been informed ; Now the choice is yours.

Ie, doing it less or more parallel. (For multiplying two 8 bit numbers, we can either use one 8 bit adder, or eight 8 bit adders to form an array.)<br><br>Then we have the Von Neumann bottleneck....<br>This isn&#39;t always a bottleneck, nor is it always applicable. Architectures like X86, ARM and so forth do have a multitude of ways to greatly reduce the requirement for memory bandwidth. Computer architectures are generally designed with the concept of programming loops in mind. Different aspects of a program are cyclic to different degrees, through Registers and Cache we can negate the need to go out to main memory for a majority of our operations.<br><br>However, certain applications dealing with large datasets where only minor computations are required on each data point, then we can stumble into the &quot;Von Neumann bottleneck&quot; or rather a memory bandwidth bottleneck (no need to credit Von Neumann for this). AI, image/video editing, particle physics, and a few other applications tends to require more memory bandwidth than most typical applications.<br><br>Then we have miniaturization of transistors.<br>We aren&#39;t even remotely close to transistors the size of an atom. Just because semiconductor manufacturers calls their nodes &quot;3nm&quot; doesn&#39;t mean that the transistors they build are 3nm large. In fact, the smallest feature on these transistors are about 20nm, and the transistor itself is a good few times larger than that. Ie, the transistors are still hundreds of atoms wide.<br><br>And in regards to computing.<br>AI and neural networks are &quot;interesting&quot;. They are useful for some applications, but are generally over applied outside of what they are actually good at.<br>I know of a lot of programmers that frankly turn to AI/NN for simpler logical tasks that they could have just written a few lines of code to do, instead of using a neural network that consumes a lot more resources while being slower at the job... (Though, programmers are getting less good at actually programming as school courses focuses more on AI/NN instead of how to break down complex tasks into smaller more manageable chunks that one can then express as logical statements. Training an AI/NN isn&#39;t programming, it is just randomly adjusting an array of values and picking the one that performed the best in some test and then reiterating over and over and over... A child can do this.)<br><br>The vast majority of computing tasks requires fairly basic logic and not that much number crunching either.<br>Though, a lot of modern programming habits tends to follow fairly inefficient approaches, like storing numbers as strings, running high level code in interpreters and using an excessive amount of floating point and arbitrarily large variables to hold generally small values. Not to mention an overreliance on bloated libraries.<br><br>AI/NN isn&#39;t applicable for a lot of computing tasks. And even for a lot of stuff where AI/NN are applicable, they have the downside of being hard to train, and having unknown behavior in situations outside their training, and this needs to be taken into consideration for a lot of applications. Then there is the unforeseen consequences of the AI/NN&#39;s decisions, so for some applications a risk analysis should be conducted, and a testing phase in a controlled environment.

We think computers are fast, but they are fast like a highway clogged with heavy traffic. One accident and the whole thing screeches to a halt. Also, like you said, with bottlenecks like the bus, the processor is usually just waiting for data to move around.<br>This became a massive problem back in the 90s with 3D games, because the math involved crushed computers at the time. For many of the games, if the math was done right, you would probably get one frame over the course of several seconds rather than the 60+ demanded for nowadays. Also, the resolution was 320x240 for quite a while. I don&#39;t think watches are even restricted to that today.<br>So, the programmers had to find ways around the computer&#39;s math bottlenecks. One way, which was done by famous games like Doom, was to make 2.5D games. First, you render a back image of the ceiling and the floor merging off into infinity. They were never 3D. Then, instead of drawing 3D, you drew 2D images with depth modifiers, which would simply shrink x and y coordinates the further they were supposed to be away from the screen. Characters were Sprites just like in Mario, but they were shrank according to the distance modifier, so it would appear like they were further away.<br>To get real 3D though, some smart programmers used bit shifting math. Math operations are very expensive computationally, requiring a large number of clock cycles at the time. But, if you shifted a register, it took one clock cycle. If you shifted a bit to the left, you multiplied it by two. So, 001 became 010, and 1 became 2. The  010 became 100, so 2 became 4. The same is said of shifting to the right, you divided by 2.<br>So, with a bit of loss in precision, you could multiply and divide in just a few clock cycles instead of hundreds. Add in having the computer store results of pretty much every sin and cosine result in a look up table and you had functional and fast 3D engines that worked well enough for games.", "comment_date": "2022-03-02T12:58:55Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Ashley Oliver", "comment_text": "The comparison between analogue and digital around 2&#39;40&quot; was pants to the point of being misleading.

Electronic analog control systems were, much faster, and more accurate for the fixed tasks the did such as PID feedback control. We had plenty of patch panel simulators with op amps programmed with banana plugs like the one Derek showed. Even today many measurements are made with analog sensing devices so A/D conversion is needed, but the flexibility of digital computation has replaced the analog controllers decades ago, even though the function block algorithms still mimic the early analog circuits.

It&#39;s not about analog or digital it&#39;s about where computation takes place. The real paradigm is a so-called in memory computing where weights are stored in memory (either as digital or analogue) and computation is done in the same place where the weights are. This is a real energy saver since weights don&#39;t have to be moved all the time from memory to the computation unit (and in modern digital matrix vector multipliers this consumes more energy than the computation itself).<br>Analog vs digital is another story. Analog has two different types, partially analog where weights are stored digitally but computation is done in analog fashion or fully analog where not only computation is done in analog domain but also weights are stored as analog. In general while analog is more power efficient, computations are far less accurate requiring a lot of so-called quantization steps when signal is recovered between the layers of computation. This reduces accuracy of the computation significantly. To increase it, one needs to perform more fine grained quantization that requires more and more precise ADCs and DACs that then burn more energy so with increased accuracy the efficiency goes down. It&#39;s fairly complex topic and Mytic&#39;s approach is really not the most promising one (the most promising one is partial analog approach).", "comment_date": "2022-03-02T00:33:54Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Bob Hickman", "comment_text": "Love the demo of an analog computer on a digital storage oscilloscope :)", "comment_date": "2022-03-02T00:32:46Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Nick K", "comment_text": "This brings a whole new meaning to &quot;Application specific integrated circuit&quot; :X", "comment_date": "2022-03-02T00:30:11Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Exo Sphere", "comment_text": "analog AI means defective chance of 1-3% right ?? soooooo robot apocalypse YAAYEEEEEEE", "comment_date": "2022-03-02T00:29:36Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "timjs1018", "comment_text": "Your head from the <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GVsUOuSjvcg&amp;t=19m35s\">19:35</a> mark to about <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GVsUOuSjvcg&amp;t=20m35s\">20:35</a> looks like a deep fake and it&#39;s tripping me out.", "comment_date": "2022-03-02T00:27:19Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "anthony steele", "comment_text": "huh. this includes the most clear explanation of neural networks I&#39;ve ever seen.", "comment_date": "2022-03-02T00:27:00Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Lachlan Ridley", "comment_text": "Anologe crypto mining? \ud83e\udd14", "comment_date": "2022-03-02T00:26:43Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "satyris410", "comment_text": "yes but can the mythic chip mine dogecoin is the question we&#39;re all wondering", "comment_date": "2022-03-02T00:25:32Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Nick Lorigo", "comment_text": "Nile Red, Practical Engineering AND Vertasium all uploaded?? its the holy Trinity\ud83d\ude2b\ud83d\ude2b", "comment_date": "2022-03-02T00:23:05Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Fabio Ferrari", "comment_text": "Analog computers can only work if they can learn by themselves to auto-correct and compensate for the inherent personal physical differences.

On the other perhaps we forgot how long it takes a human brain to be programmed. Because the early years i imagine as a near to infinite trip, do you have children? I mean that&#39;s crazy how they suck in their environment and this computer is computing all the time while time can you remember how it was aged six perhaps? an afternoon is an &quot;eternity&quot; imagine how this stretching of time is for a baby which has to be &quot;programmed&quot; it&#39;s the mass of information we have to compute which stretches the subjective time (respectively shrinks it so drastically in age) - until out of this noise you slowly get an impression and here we are impression humans have impressions of we don&#39;t perceive the reality we perceive an impression of it. But and that is the interesting thing we cannot only differ between things we give them a meaning, we have to give them a meaning, thus a tree isn&#39;t only a tree for us we have a relation to tree in multiple ways, the image the smell, the feel of the bark it&#39;s near to infinite and it is only an impression of it. I smell the pine without that i have to see it or that one has to be close to me, i can imagine and draw it and therefore i need impression and not &quot;who is who&quot;. An often by me used example is you can&#39;t learn to walk theoretically you have to walk that&#39;s all, i can have all the information about a matter but that doesn&#39;t mean that i understand the matter this are two different things. And well you see how many humans we have who think they understand the matter just because they know it from an auditorium and what the result is of this and well it won&#39;t differ for a machine, it will be an idiot who knows all yet nothing.

It is as would we expect from Lucy to write an e-mail just because she is a human and her intelligence is to assume on the same level as ours. Lucy will have communicate verbal but she neither could have expressed herself like we can thus the experiment would fail the same with her you can&#39;t expect to jump over 50&#39;000 years in a single lifetime. It&#39;s totally stupid to expect this from primates which brings me again to the conscious machine, wouldn&#39;t it be reasonable to assume that it needs a linear amount of time to evolve like we needed, that we can&#39;t expect this in &quot;one generation&quot;?<br>Not seen from the point of how it technically evolves seen as organism which has first to learn to sort the impressions and that this takes more then one lifetime to match the ten thousands of years we needed for this, simply because we neither reached this in one lifetime.

While this has its advantages in that there is a solid understanding of how to work with it, linear algebra is fundamentally limited by being, well, linear. You can think of a classification problem as trying to separate a dataset in two. You have a bunch of images represented as datapoints on a grid, and you want to draw a <b>straight</b> line to separate the two so that the cats on are one side and the dogs are on the other. When training an SLP, you&#39;re tuning the slope and intercept (weight and bias) of the line.<br><br>This sounds fine, but consider the problem Minsky and Papert presented: imagine a binary dataset (is this image a cat or a dog?) such that one of the sets was all on the 2nd and 4th quadrants of the grid, and the other was on the 1st and 3rd. Basically, one of the datasets was on the (+x, +y) and (-x, -y) sides and the other was on (-x, +y) and (+x, -y). How do you a draw a <b>straight</b> line to separate the two? The answer is you can&#39;t. Any line you draw will always have, on average, a 50% error rate, which essentially means it&#39;s a coin toss as the whether or not the &quot;prediction&quot; is correct. This is called the &quot;XOR problem&quot;<br><br>This fundamental limit to SLPs is due to their nature of being linear: because you can only draw straight lines, you can&#39;t do better than random guessing for certain tasks like the XOR problem.

They produce spikes, yes, but the spikes are produced by voltage building up in the neuron, until it reaches some threshold, at which point biomechanical gates open and close (allowing or preventing ions to flow) to produce a rapid non-linear rise and fall in voltage, ie. spike, which is transmitted to other connected neurons. There is even a stochastic aspect to the opening and closing of these gates, which we don&#39;t yet know the full significance of computationally. This spiking behaviour also adds a temporal aspect, which isn&#39;t represented by either the digital or analogue neural networks discussed here. In most neural nets the neurons are always synced up, continuously transmitting and receiving information to and from all their connections at every time step, but in the brain one neuron may spike at 30hz and another at 25hz, or they could be the same frequency but in or out of phase, and that may itself be computationally significant.<br><br>For example, using a leaky integrate and fire model of neurons (more biologically accurate than typical neural net neurons, but not including any of the gating or non-linear spikes), connecting two excitatory neurons can result in them syncing up into phase, even if they started out of phase, and connecting two inhibitory neurons can result in them becoming 180\u00b0 out of phase, even if they started in phase. In digital processors and (presumably also) the analogue processor shown here, there is a clock which syncs up operations globally and is external to those operations, but in the brain different neurons can run at different speeds and sync up with other neurons in a more local/decentralised way. And importantly, because timing can be affected by the connections between neurons, and those connections can change through learning, the timings can also change, which is not really possible with either architecture discussed here.<br><br>How computationally important are any these more fine-grained, biological details? No idea! Some are probably very important, others might just be biological implementation details. Either way, I&#39;m personally convinced if we want AIs which approach a human level of generalised intelligence (and that&#39;s a big if), we&#39;re going to need hardware which more closely resembles the brain", "comment_date": "2022-03-01T21:11:39Z", "likes_count": 55}, {"comment_by": "DethstruXioN \u2122", "comment_text": "I already pre-ordered my iBacus", "comment_date": "2022-03-01T21:09:53Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Rick Sanchez", "comment_text": "25 trillion operations per second at 3 watts?

Modern avionics is digital, is triplicated, and is very expensive to develop (&quot;proving&quot; it to be correct takes time). If the CPU you&#39;ve put it on goes out of production you&#39;ve got an enormous problem porting the software to a new platform. It&#39;s easy to do the porting, but you have to redo all the testing (which is where the work is). <br><br>So keeping such avionics viable for a long time is a major exercise in obsolescence management (unless the digital system happens to be implemented on a processing system that is formed out of discrete transistor packages). <br><br>Whereas, if you solve the differential equations using analogue electronics, it&#39;s far easier to demonstrate that the system is solving them correctly. The design layout follows the equation&#39;s layout, so that&#39;s simple to be sure of. After that it&#39;s a matter of calibration, largely. Better still, using nothing but transistors and passive components, it&#39;s far, far easier to manage obsolescence. As the gain of a transistor is set by the passive components around it, you&#39;re literally able to replace a blown transistor with just about any other so long as it&#39;s the right type, and meets a minimum spec. <br><br>This means that keeping analogue computers serviceable is far, far easier in the long term. You&#39;re not tied to using the exact same components as the original designers used. <br><br>I was once told that Concorde&#39;s electronics where of this happy nature - analogue systems for some parts (flight control?), and digital systems so simple (inlet control?) that they didn&#39;t use integrated circuits (just discrete transistors). The implication was that keeping Concorde&#39;s avionics operational was the easiest possible obsolescence challenge. Whereas keeping something like an F22 flyable is a major challenge with high costs.<br><br>It&#39;s not quite that clear cut; digital does allow one to do things that simply aren&#39;t very straightforward in analogue, and keeping an analogue system in calibration takes effort that is much reduced in a digital system (which simply needs its sensors / actuators checked, not the entire internals of the electronics). Noise is also an issue for analogue systems, though I liked the approach taken by that company - hopping between the digital and analogue domain a lot, to preserve signal integrity between computational stages. <br><br>So may be the ideal flight control system is an analogue computer that is wired up digitally, rather than just through wiring!", "comment_date": "2022-03-01T19:27:44Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Jamie Fisk", "comment_text": "Welp,  I guess this ratchets up the start date for the singularity by about 100 years.", "comment_date": "2022-03-01T19:27:22Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Alireza Alikhani", "comment_text": "I hoped you talk about neuromorphic.

Neurons apply filters which contain kernels that use the Sobel operator for edge detections on their receptive field. The filters are learnt through backpropagation and are initialized with weights either using random gaussian, Glorot/Xavier or He, methods. This all works on the pixel intensity gradient. These filters extract the features, creating feature maps (a map for each kernel in the filter). These features get sent to a pooling layer to reduce redundant features.

Lets take your example of adding 2 currents and multiplying them with the resistance. Yeah, that is a simple model. So? It is also simple to say &quot;and now everybody is happy&quot;,\r<br>When it then comes to really implement that multiplication you need 2 high quality current-sources and a precision resistor as well as a precision measurement instrument to get that number. Want to use the result again? Then you now need a way to convert that voltage into a current yet again - without a significant loss in quality. It takes power, no matter if it calculates something or not.\r<br>And now lets look at a digital circuit for that: Yes, a lot more transistors are needed, but none of them need to be that precise. Further more each of them can drive a decent number of other transistors without extra circuitry. And as is a characteristics of mosfets - they basically only require power to CHANGE state and nearly nothing to maintain it.\r<br>So IF you have a continuous stream of ever changing inputs then analog can be efficient.\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>Also look at how INCREDIBLE efficient such simple calculations can be done:\r<br>Calculators draw in the range of microamps and still can solve differential equations.\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>Analog system can be very interesting for specialised applications, but they are not capable of competing for general problems and nearly always are used as a last resort cause digital solutions can not provide the bandwidth or power required (things like high power high frequency amplifiers). So training one particular neural network can be very efficient on analog systems as you do not have a specific goal for each neuron as their entire behaviour is the result of random variations. The network not needing accuracy is then again just wrong. Yes, in simple examples it does not matter if the result if 98% or 99% certainty - until the point it actually does matter and the result needs to be exact and repeatable.\r<br>And the example with the SSD - ok, so now you &quot;only&quot; need 1 transistor for the lossy multiplication, but docents of transistors of to generate and convert the analog signal... and you are then comparing that to a general purpose CPU that calculates the number not to an uncertain degree but accurate. A GPU like shown - sure, 100W, for &quot;only&quot; 2 trillion operations per second. But that is 2 trillion 32 bit operations without error. How long would it take for the analog system to produce similar accuracy? There is a reason why dedicated hardware for neural networks emerged with for lower accuracy, going as low as 4 bit multiplications.

And using this concept you are saying in future we will require better computers for more deeper neural networks. However there is a flaw in your assumption. The beauty of resnet&#39;s performance is not  because of 100 or even 1000 of layers ... it is because of an architectural feature called &quot;skip connections&quot;. Skip connections can bypass entire blocks of layers by an identity mapping. This bypass improves performance as neural networks having non linear activation functions often have difficulty in replicating an identity mapping. The beauty of Resnet is that an 100 layer Resnet can understand that the best performance  can be achieved using only 25 layers and bypass the 75 additional layers with skip connections. This also drastically reduces training times as no. of trainable weights go down and hence more computation power is not necessary. Also having more complicated neural networks with extra layers often reduce performance and overfit the data .....

This means that the &quot;analog&quot; part is always discrete digital levels.  All you have done is create a digital system that runs on base 8 math instead of base 2 math.  ADCs and DACs can go much higher than 8-bit resolution, and would sum or multiply with a granularity that is finer than the manufacturing tolerance of the circuit, which would result in unpredictable results, which is more &quot;analog&quot; I guess.  However I would argue that what we want is to just focus on creating digital gates or transistors that have more than 2 states, but are still perfectly digital and reproducible.

I see this perspective something that is very much missing from discussion about the future of computing in general.  On one hand we keep on being told that the end is in sight for Moore&#39;s law and then we get told that quantum computers will come to the rescue.  This is a highly simplified view which misses out a lot of detail  - classical digital computers are really great at performing certain types of tasks and will continue to serve a certain utility for the foreseeable future and the end of Moore&#39;s law is no problem here.<br><br>There are clearly things that a classical digital computer are not good at e.g. AI and here the end to Moore&#39;s law is problematic and a good reason for considering different architectures.<br><br>I have been critical of the way that reporting on quantum computers have been depicted by the media.  It is obvious that we do need to focus on new computing architectures however the landscape of options is not binary like the media tend to suggest  - there are many other options apart from quantum computers. <br><br>What&#39;s more, some of the less technically challenging alternative computing architectures like the analog neural network that you showcased in this video are great from a perspective that it is relatively easy to get the hardware operational which allows the R&amp;D effort to be focused more towards the application of the technology - in this case useful neural networks.<br><br>There are many other interesting technologies in this space - photonic computers is one worth a mention. <br><br>Also I see opportunities to merge other ideas together here.  Cypress Semiconductor (now part of Infineon) developed a technology that they call PSOC which is basically a merging of FPGA programmability with analog circuitry - if this is applied to analog computer architecture then maybe we can design highly generalized analog computing architecture. <br><br>I also think that digital computers can be developed considerably based on the more than Moore concept.  I.E., once we run out of performance improvements that can made from moving to finer ASIC geometries then there is likely to be more focus placed on what else can be done at an architectural level to gain performance improvements  - something that is being overlooked based on the Moore&#39;s law path being identified as the lowest hanging fruit.", "comment_date": "2022-03-01T15:52:16Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "GAMING WITH VAIBHAV", "comment_text": "the gist of this video is we don&#39;t need digital and analog but we need a hybrid of both of them", "comment_date": "2022-03-01T15:51:26Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "K Cox", "comment_text": "Why are we still acting like it&#39;s one or the other?

I had been programming for quite some time at that point so I had my basic tools in place, so to say, but I really didn&#39;t know where to start from there when it came to what I picked as a &quot;task&quot; I wanted to solve by this method.<br>The task I picked was driving a little simulated 2D-car along a randomly generated road without any human input and unfortunately, the language I was most proficient in at the time was Java, so I tried to implement it in Java. <br>When I first started the project, I read a lot about neural networks and even included some scientific papers on it in my reading, but not stemming from any kind of scientific background, I really struggled to understand the deeper concepts presented in those, which eventually lead me to just abandon reading up on the topic and just approach it with the general concept of &quot;How could/would it work?&quot;. <br>Looking back, I think I have never in my life experienced a time when I was more challenged by a task I set out to complete and also never before I was thinking that much about how our brains actually process information, as that is the key idea behind it. Yet, slowly but surely, I ended up with a pretty similar concept to what most neural networks do, even though probably far less efficient than using something that was already available like TensorFlow. <br>Where am I going with this story? Well, after a while it actually worked, the little network I created &quot;learned&quot; how to drive the car along the road after countless iterations of doing it wrong and to this day, it just absolutely blew my mind on so many levels that this was possible. Even more so considering that all of these complex processes take place in our brains every microsecond we exist with much more proficiency. I absolutely loved that project from beginning to end and if not for the rest of that educational path I took and years of aimlessly programming for fun, it just made me know that I truly love the entire concept of using programming to recreate something in nature. <br><br>Kind of an pointless anecdote, sorry.", "comment_date": "2022-03-01T15:42:25Z", "likes_count": 50}, {"comment_by": "Mike Eckert", "comment_text": "we&#39;re building computers wrong? just like how electricity doesn&#39;t flow through wires?", "comment_date": "2022-03-01T15:42:13Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "TheMitchyevans", "comment_text": "It sounds like the future is more of a hybrid model between analog and digital.", "comment_date": "2022-03-01T15:41:59Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "David Haas", "comment_text": "Love your channel and the work you do.

The best I make of it is that, architecturally, they are implementing a series of matrix multiplications through all the layers of their neural network. Whereas, the brain&#39;s neurons simply take an input vector and compares the sum of its components to a threshold value. Whereupon it outputs a 1 or a 0. The neuron doesn&#39;t care care how far above or below the threshold the incoming signal is. That&#39;s the brains A-D conversion process. The neuron throws out scads of input information in the process, but the output signal is not vague. This may be the trading-off precision for simplicity (i.e., efficiency; also,the principle of occam&#39;s razor). Certainly, the brain processes in a noisy environment. Thermal noise must be there, and I wouldn&#39;t be surprised to find other strong sources of noise. This is a Shannon noisy channel coding problem.

The number of transistors doubles and so the performance should double. But this Law is wrong for many years. CPUs with multiple cores, increased parallelization of tasks and specialized computation units like in the ARM world has shown that increasing the transistors isn&#39;t the only way to increase the compute power of a digital machine. Yes, there is a physical limit how small a transistor can get, but there are new transistor forms to solve this problem like CasFET. <br><br>The second statement that is not quite correct was by the CEO of Mythic. He shows a GPU and states that it can compute 10-20 trillion operation per seconds. This is right - but so does a Snapdragon or A14 from Apple with much much lower power usage. His product is not faster than an ARM based digital processor. It can be more power efficient, but only a few watts. Virtual Reality already uses this digital processors to compute the kinematics in real time. The problem is not the local processing power he wants to solve.<br><br>The third statement was that smaller inaccuracies are okay to accept - but only for the final product. Any error a long the line for deep neuron networks will cascade and create a big error in the end. Digital computers also have the problems because of their floating number arithmetic - they can use a slower, but more accurate computation model to minimize the error. <br><br>Also the downside of using the flash cells was not stated - flash cells degenerated over time, so the analogue computer will die some time? Yes, SSDs with their flash cells have a long life now, but because they don&#39;t read / write cells all the time and have some backup cells they switch to. <br><br>The shown examples couldn&#39;t convince me that analogue computers will have a bigger part in the market.

There will never actually be a AI because that would be a threat to the people that control the world today. As we know power corrupts and power corrupts absolutely. The people in power today would never create a way for them to be superceeded or a way that someone else could take control of the golden egg politically. <br><br>It is far safer when you wish to gain control from viruses and AI and climate change to have no evidence of the thing itself. If you have evidence you have a beginning and an ending. As in 1984 power requires a state of perminant emergency. If you isolate a virus someone will be able to solve it.

Higher IQ of the general population leads to reduction of corruption. <br><br>How such a genetic shift would occure is unknown. Maybe a secret team of doctors that learn to reverse enginner the poison covid vaccines and stumple upon a benevolent use of gene therapies to increae life expectancy (as older people have more time to reach correct conclusions) and level up the genepool to closer to the 1% IQ level.
