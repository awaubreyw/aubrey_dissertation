Choices and actions make success, not waiting for it to fall in your lap.  Great reflections from your place in life&#39;s timeline.<br>Please continue to create thoughtful and average-person-accessible science.  Maybe you have more to say about mathematic chaos and unpredictability vs common use of the word &quot;chaos&quot; as random or contrary to order.", "comment_date": "2021-01-23T17:48:20Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "T NS", "comment_text": "10yrs...hmmp", "comment_date": "2021-01-23T17:33:51Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Dr.Strange", "comment_text": "Sir, you brought back the curiosity in Me!!<br>And thats the best thing happened to me!", "comment_date": "2021-01-23T17:29:14Z", "likes_count": 2}, {"comment_by": "Dr.Strange", "comment_text": "Where is the form?\ud83d\ude44", "comment_date": "2021-01-23T17:28:06Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "prateek maurya", "comment_text": "Veritasium hindi &quot; i am available for translating content in hindi&quot;", "comment_date": "2021-01-23T17:14:53Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Tejas Asija", "comment_text": "ZYSS", "comment_date": "2021-01-23T16:02:08Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Utkarsh I.", "comment_text": "there&#39;s a veritasium hindi version? i&#39;d love to dub that :o", "comment_date": "2021-01-23T15:23:26Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Keelan Rose", "comment_text": "I love your science videos most.

You cannot really see wind but you can feel it and see it&#39;s affects around you.  What if I could color it.   Is wind necessary for trees to flourish?  What life forms would be affected if it died out and everything was still?<br>3) What about wave motion.

If you ask me what do I wanna see in your videos, I can say &#39;make more science videos from &#39;unique&#39; laboratories all around the world, things like this fire music from denmark, pitch drop experiment, Svalbard seeds fault, aerogel lab.

I always feel a little bit smarter when I watch your videos. I had some exposure to the work of a physicist, Julius Sumner Miller when I was in Junior High. I remember that he could teach complex ideas that could fascinate children but also educate adults. Your methodology reminds me of him. I like your videos that are fun and entertaining and I like the videos that go a bit deeper, do the math, show your work, etc. It is vital that we affirm the value of science, facts, ideas, investigation otherwise we become a country and world only interested in tweets and tictoks. Derek, we need people like you to educate us and challenge us to think rationally otherwise our brains will atrophy.

But instead of looking for the evidence that supports your preconceived beliefs \u2013 which is how pseudoscience works \u2013 do it scientifically. Look at all the evidence and see where it leads. In the video, you should answer the following questions:<br>1. What exactly is Climate Change? Because, we already know we&#39;re in the middle of an interglacial period aka a global warming. So... climate is changing... how exactly? Is an ice age coming sooner than expected? Or will the global warming intensify?<br>2. How can we distinguish between natural climate change and man made climate change?<br>3. Is there sufficient evidence to believe human activity causes  Climate Change?<br>4. If humans cause climate change, how do we know that we&#39;re not accidentally stabilizing it? How do we know, for example, that a naturally occurring ice age is coming and, thanks to our industrial activity, we&#39;re delaying that ice age?<br>5. How do we know that the measures you propose won&#39;t actually make matters worse. It&#39;s a chaotic system after all!<br><br>Oh, I almost forgot. While you talk about the climate, don&#39;t forget to make the viewers understand what a chaotic system is. And make sure they understand that in science, chaotic means, by definition, unpredictable. I mean, it order to predict such a system, you would have to break the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle. <br><br><b>10 REASONS THAT MAKE ME DOUBT HUMANS CAUSE CLIMATE CHANGE</b><br><br><b>\u2460</b> Throughout most of its history Earth had no polar ice caps and the average global temperature was between 8\u00b0C and 15\u00b0C warmer than present time.<br><br><b>\u2461</b> We are in the middle of a 2.58-million-year-old glaciation \u2013 the Quaternary Glaciation.<br><br><b>\u2462</b> The current global warming started about 12,000 years ago. That&#39;s how the last ice age ended and the current interglacial period, the Holocene, began. This warm and cozy climate won&#39;t last forever \u2013 interglacial periods last between 20,000 and 60,000 years.<br><br><b>\u2463</b> Between 12,000 and 7,000 years ago the sea level rose by 197 ft (60 m). Look up the Early Holocene Sea Level Rise!<br><br><b>\u2464</b> The climate is always changing. There is no such thing as a stable climate. If you want to learn more about the <i>stability</i> of the climate, you might want to look up: The 8.2 Kiloyear Event; The Little Ice Age; The Year Without a Summer (1816).<br><br><b>\u2465</b> Compared to solar activity, the Milankovitch Cycles or volcanic activity, human activity has an insignificant effect in the long term evolution of the climate. We cannot start, end, or prevent ice ages or global warmings. We&#39;re not that significant.<br><br><b>\u2466</b> Chaos Theory explains how the behavior of some systems is unpredictable (chaotic). Even simple systems can exhibit chaotic behavior, like the double pendulum (look it up!). No one can predict the climate, because the climate is a stupidly complex chaotic system.<br><br><b>\u2467</b> During the Hirnantian glaciation there was 10 times more atmospheric CO\u2082.<br><br><b>\u2468</b> 95% of all greenhouse gases on earth is water vapor.<br><br><b>\u2469</b> CO\u2082 does not fit in any way shape or form the definition of a pollutant. Almost all the oxygen in the atmosphere is a byproduct of photosynthesis \u2013 a process by which plants use light energy to produce glucose from CO\u2082 and water. CO\u2082 is used in the food industry, for example, in the production of carbonated beverages like: beer, soda, sparkling water etc. CO\u2082 is also used in hospitals, for example, in laparoscopic surgery.<br><br><br>There are many scientists who disagree with various aspects of the man-made climate change hypothesis. One of them is Ivar Giaever, Nobel laureate in physics, who said that &quot;Global Warming is pseudoscience&quot;. Freeman Dyson said that &quot;Climate Change predictions are absurd&quot;. Keep in mind that science doesn&#39;t work by consensus. Science isn&#39;t a democracy. As Carl Sagan put it:<br><br><i>Science is more than a body of knowledge. It is a way of thinking; a way of skeptically interrogating the universe with a fine understanding of human fallibility. If we are not able to ask skeptical questions, to interrogate those who tell us that something is true, to be skeptical of those in authority, then, we are up for grabs for the next charlatan (political or religious) who comes rambling along.</i><br><br>In general, when you&#39;re convinced of <i>your truth,</i> make an effort to get out of the echo chamber and listen to the opposite point of view.

I\u2019d love to see a lot of that in 2021, especially the elucidation upon how science is done. I watched your video about the illusion only some can see and saw a connection to the video you made about confirmation, and both of those videos were certainly interesting. But I want to know how science applies the Raven Paradox and falsifiability to theories. Also, your video about the two-way speed of light was incredible. I\u2019d love to see more videos challenging deeply held assumptions in most people that are really just conventions. I will research this on my own, but I think that making videos on this will be useful for everybody. <br><br>As a freshman in college hoping to become a theoretical physicist, I\u2019m interested in not only the philosophy of science but also challenging my own intuitions and thinking.

I feel like statistical physics has not been covered much by the science part of youtube (space things are more popular I guess), while it is a fairly fundamental idea in modern physics.<br>As a physics master student that focuses on condensed matter, a video on band theory and semi conductor physics could be cool. The idea of electrons in a period potential turning out to be wave-like should be something that is possible to explain to your audience that have heard a few tidbits of Quantum Mechanics over the years. Band filling is a somewhat intuitive concept and could be mind blowing for some as a more fundamental explanation of why some things conduct while other materials don&#39;t.<br>I would also love for you to do a video explaining superconductivity, but I think it would be hard to go beyond the general &#39;it&#39;s two electrons teaming up&#39;. Maybe a video about Bose-Einstein condensates could be more accessible, with the Helium condensate fountain as a cool hook.<br><br>I think you also like to sometimes illuminate little known things about big topics in pop science. Your two-way speed of light video would be an example of that.<br>A topic I would like to see you cover is fundamentals of Probability, Randomness and Determinism, although you have covered it loosely in videos like the Quantum Entanglement one.<br>Sean Carroll did an excellent lecture series over the summer. You might find inspiration in the episode 19 (Probability and Randomness).

Yeah, as someone that watches like half the science channels on YouTube I knew &#39;on paper&#39; how much of modern experimentation is driven by teasing out sigma-level statistical trends from billions of lines of data, no big Eureka moments... but watching an actual researcher walk through the process on such a significant project was wholly different than knowing the theory.<br><br>That particular type of behind-the-scenes isn&#39;t something we get to see very often in the context of the sciences. Lots of other fields have their documentaries and directors commentaries and such that cover these kinds of &quot;how the sausage is made&quot; moments but it&#39;s pretty rare outside of the entertainment industry, from what I&#39;ve run across anyway. If I was going to actively ask for something specific from the channel, that would be it - more talks with scientists/researchers/etc. about how they came to accept some particular piece of data as legitimate or change their minds about some theory.<br><br>( Of course, it didn&#39;t hurt any that the other LIGO videos are also among the best of the channel and experiment itself is bloody awe inspiring. )", "comment_date": "2021-01-07T21:59:20Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "42isTh3Answ3r", "comment_text": "One of the best Channel out there", "comment_date": "2021-01-07T21:59:06Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "AnacondaHL", "comment_text": "honestly?

Since then I went further and further away from science, but weird enough, the only books I have are on these subjects. Channels like Veritasium keeps this love lit up inside of me, keeps feeding me this knowledge I couldn&#39;t follow in my life. So, truly, I have only to thank you, really, for all of your work.
