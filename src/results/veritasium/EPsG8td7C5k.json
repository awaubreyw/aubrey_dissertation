Is a monumental achievement. If you\u2019re talking about using a spaceship that travels at the speed of light. Light has barely any force behind it. It weighs practically nothing and passes through objects. Because it\u2019s a smaller particle then most. <br>Turning light into thrust therefore becomes exceedingly difficult. Unless it\u2019s done inside a special chamber or vacuum tube. With a great amount of lost energy or trust. Like with an ion drive thruster. Which could get a close to light speed Eventually. If it had enough fuel and time to achieve the velocity. Which would probably take longer than a human life span. <br>Faster than the speed of light would require an amount of power humans are incapable of achieving from earth. Also I think if something achieved light speed. It\u2019s entirely possible the molecular structure of the atoms that comprise the spaceship. Would start breaking down. Due to resonance distortion. Parts of the ship would start to just evaporate or degrade away. By the time light speed was achieved. As the speed is increased its power to thrust ratio could hit unstable harmonics. That cause the thing to disintegrate. One spec of anything floating in space would pass right through the ship killing anyone on board. <br>So just to travel the speed of light. You would have to have something that travels ahead or faster than the ship. To clear the way. <br>One common hypothesis for faster than light travel. Is using a space tube. Which is like a subway tunnel created with a series of gates you pass through. That give a push or boost. But I think even then. It would be a massive undertaking. To string hyper gates across the universe or solar system. <br>Each gate would have to have a fixed position in perfect alignment. With the power of the sun focused into the hyper gate system. <br>This would get closer to real light speed. But the strain on the ship and therefore the people inside. <br>Could prove to be fatal.

A stupid scholar all overturned this truth and built it to a convenient system of Mason. Thus, the people believe the trickery of the devil than words of God. Darwin&#39;s evolutionary theory, the Copernican theory of Galileo, the theory of relativity, quantum mechanics, mathematics, the medicine of Einstein are all errors. A ghost, a UFO, supernatural power, the miracle of God to be said to be the occult are rather true. A thing and a ghost (God) exist in the world, and space is active by spiritual power (conception) of God. As for God, all things were created by the soul of language. It is clear if I read the Bible. Because the present scholar mixes the logic thoroughly in human wisdom, it cannot arrive at the truth. It is intuitive power to be important. Why does a child seem to be? The thing which cannot answer this is a mistake. Our common sense is more right than a stupid scholar. The creation of God comes loose only by a fate. Everything becomes the material by a conception of God (person).<br> <br>I cannot prove 1+1 = 2 in a numerical formula. I can prove only a physical phenomenon to say that it is in two apples when I match another one apple with one apple. It is not 0+1 \u2260 1. As 0 (nothing) is not quality, you must not handle it for a number. Because quality is different even if I match a mandarin orange with an apple, there is not a meaning of the addition. Because it does not exist other than God when I define God as existence, no (0) does not exist. Because the mathematics defines 0, negative number, imaginary number, \u221e which do not exist in the world, it is an error and is a fiction. A number is to count quality. When I am separated from a physical phenomenon, the mathematics does not have the significance of being.<br><br>\u203bIf 0 exists by a definition of the mathematics, 0 of the infinity must exist. However, the infinite space, infinity do not exist. In other words, because the mathematics defines 0, negative number, imaginary number, \u221e which do not exist, it is an error and is a fiction. Therefore it is an error because a zeta function, the numerical formula of the second oiler product deal with this infinity. That it becomes sum of series \u03a3 = 1+2+3+ ... = - 1/12 of the natural number, or the product of all prime numbers is 4\u03c0^2. It turns out that it is an error if I think for common sense. It is limited, and the mathematician seems to get a wrong this, but uses the sophism when I calculate this endlessly if right. This is a mistake of the definition of 0 or \u221e and is the evidence that mathematics gets a wrong. It is definition f&#39;(x) = limh of the differential calculus that must not divide it by 0 \u2192 0 {the same as it being 0 that says that I bring h close to 0 without a limit, and dividing it by a numerical formula of f(x+h)-f(x)}/h. I divide it by 0. The mathematics is trickery not study in this way.<br><br> All the origins of the scientific theory are random, and a bottom is broken. For example, in the theory of elementary particles, an electron joins atoms together and becomes the molecules. A thing joining a proton and a neutron together is a mesotron, and three quarks connect the proton, and there is it. An electron and a positron (antimatter) occur from a photon. An elementary particle to tie the elementary particle to whenever a new elementary particle is discovered is necessary and loses the relations with an elementary particle and the elementary particle more and more. Though a proton and the neutron are the same mass, why does a difference occur in having electric charge or not? The science has no answer with it in these questions. An electron is a material so that I think, and the positron is not a material in the hole of the material loss that the circumference was surrounded by in the soul children. In other words, the antimatter is an illusion. The scholar is going to examine it logically and loses sight of the truth. The structure of built nature of God is simpler, but is the thing which it is hard to understand in the human wisdom. A photon seems to have a particle and the two characteristics of the wave, but, in fact, the light has the property of the wave with the soul body.<br><br> Message from the spiritual world of Einstein <br> When oneself saw a scene of heaven through a tunnel of the light in the meantime, the person who experienced suspended animation well is you after the revival. The moving speed of the soul does not receive gravitational restraint anymore, and, as for the law of the speed of light immutability that I discovered during the lifetime, there are none in the world of the consciousness. In other words, I will say that it just moves to say that I think. Furthermore, it is just handed down to a partner to have thought. The life of all of us shares what one interiority. And the material is to say that it was actually consciousness. There are all things in your heart, and, also, you are existence to live in a heart of all life. When all of this space watches it with eyes, it is seen like the outside world, but is to say that the world to be actually seen outside is your interiority.

A human being is cruel, and a fornication, a falsehood, committing theft, the habit of the evil deed of the luxury are not stopped. Eating meat is indirect killing. Why is God that existence of the evil is permitted? It lets you compensate for a human crime by the devil. A disaster, an epidemic, the war damage are the wrath of Heaven. Because a Japanese savior buys the crime of the world people, it is sacrificed. I fall in the trees and plants in spite of the pains then even if I writhe with a hell if it is just and changes the heart and does not straighten an act to measure up to hearts of God.

This transmutes the the 115 and creates a piece of anti matter.  Which is guided to a gas in a thermoelectric exchanger where it explodes creating electricity with apparently 100% efficiency.   This generates insane energy. Also Element 115 is unique in that you&#39;re able to access the gravitational forces that extend outside the nucleus of the Element 115 atoms.  This gravitational force is amplified and focused in on a small area in front of the craft.  This causes the ufo to perpetually &quot;fall&quot; towards it.  These amplifiers are pulsed, on and off.  Since the amplified gravitational field created bends space, when you pulse it off and on,  you end up doing a bunch of tiny leaps time and move faster than light.  Some say they travel about a light year a minute.  Anyway, don&#39;t take my word for it.  Check out Bob Lazar.  I like the video where his body language is observed telling his stories.

Another approach would be to prove that there cannot exist an universe with anything that would travel faster than light... which I truly doubt given that we can come up with examples such as the spot of laser moving faster than light (which is already a simulation of a different kind of an Universe).

He had a vision of a device he called the flux capacitor which is what makes going faster than the speed of light possible. It has the ability to form in an instant a warp bubble around an object and speed it up to well over light speed. The object can move so much faster than light speed it hits what&#39;s called the McFly boundary at which you can then travel through time itself. For 30 years dr. Brown struggled to develop his flux capacitor but failed due to it&#39;s requirement of 1.21 gigawatts of power. In 1985 he was able to mount a small plutonium reactor they gave him the power he required. He also found the warp bubble will not form around the object unless that object is already traveling at 88 miles per hour.

I understand the easy for misconceptions that lead to incorrect conclusions about the speed of light.  First, the speed of causality is what it is really needs to be called.    Please refer to the experiments to slow light down to validate the difference between the &quot;speed of light&quot; and the speed of causality.   Seriously, those are some really cool videos.<br><br>As for the speed of causality, the really insurmountable problem is how to detect something that moves faster than the speed of causality.    There is no current method available to detect things at that speed, because as is stated in the video &quot;the particles only go the speed of light&quot;.  It is very much like trying to detect a missile traveling faster than the speed of sound using an automobile speedometer.    <br><br>Now I am going to fault Veritasium here a bit.  In covering of the laser shining on the moon, he correctly covers the photons are traveling at the speed of causality in a straight line from the laser source to the moon.  However, there is the contribution of angular velocity, albeit extremely, ridiculously, ludicrously small in comparison to the speed of causality the photon is traveling at from the laser to the moon.  Drawing a simple triangle of the vectors shows the resultant vector to be just a tiny smidgen faster than the speed of causality.<br><br>I am interested to see what comes out of the gravitational wave experiment.

These cones are called light cones because on their axis, you are travelling at the speed of light and are no longer experiencing time--a feat in which only massless particles are capable of.<br><br>If you add a y/c axis, you can see that it is like we are fallling down a hyperbolic paraboloid (the shape of a saddle), where we are at the saddle point (level point of the center of the saddle) at the present falling into the future. If you are experiencing the speed of light, you will find that you are no longer falling, yet not climbing the surface since that&#39;s impossible--you are constantly level; thus by not being able to fall, the time dilation works out so that you do not experience time whatsoever.<br><br>For the sake of our imagination, we do not imagine a (z/c) axis since this is a fourth dimension, but it is there.<br><br>Why can particles experience this if particles must decay?

For one thing, it isn&#39;t a &#39;speed&#39; at all.  That is, it isn&#39;t just a velocity through space.  The &#39;speed of light&#39; is in actuality the speed of causality through Time AND Space.  The speed of causality for each and every person, atom, particle, photon, neutrino, wave... every single thing in our universe is always running at the speed of light in FOUR dimensions, not three.  No slower, no faster.  It&#39;s always exactly the speed of light.  If you are standing still then your causality is still going at the speed of light on the Time axis.  If you are observing something moving in space, then its causality vector is going at some velocity V through space but its rate of time (T) will be slower, such that the Time-Space vector itself remains going at exactly the speed of light.<br><br>I&#39;m musing units a little, but that&#39;s the key point.  In 4 dimensions, all vectors in our space-time are always exactly the same length, period.  No shorter, no longer.<br><br>Now throw in special relativity, which is just a statement of the above.  We can state that the speed of causality in four dimensions (the three dimensions of space + one dimension of time) is always constant.  All experimental evidence points to it being a constant, and there is really an awful lot of that evidence.  But how we MEASURE it is another problem entirely.  What Einstein&#39;s special relativity says is that the above rules work for any observer in an inertial reference frame (that is, not undergoing acceleration).  So if your measurement of causality is relative to your current position in space, then your measurement in space is that you are going a velocity of 0 in all three dimensions of space and thus your time axis must be going at the speed of light (that is, as fast as it is possible for time to go by any measurement you can make).  If you measure the speed of an object flying past you, using your current position as the (0,0,0), then it will have a velocity vector in three dimensions and your observation of that object&#39;s clock will be slower, such that its causality vector in 4 dimensions is precisely the speed of light.<br><br>The confusion for most people is that they don&#39;t understand that &#39;time&#39; is inexorably linked to velocity in space, and that both velocity and time can only be measured relative to something else.  There is NO absolute notion of velocity <b>or</b> time in space.<br><br>So if we take the example in this video and just assume that the string can handle whatever forces we throw at it, the object at the end of the string still can&#39;t ever exceed the speed of light in terms of its measured velocity.  What will happen instead is that as you throw more and more energy into the object to speed it up, as the object approaches the speed of light in terms of its velocity vector, where the energy will go instead of increasing its velocity further is into the TIME dimension of its vector.  Your measurement of the object&#39;s clock will show that time is moving slower and slower for the object as its velocity measured relative to your finger gets closer and closer to the speed of light.<br><br>Derek does not state this directly, but basically when he talks about the amount of energy you have to put into the system to speed it up, that&#39;s where the energy is going ... into the TIME dimension for the object, and less and less of it is going into the three dimensions of space that govern its velocity.<br><br>The reality of this experiment is actually more complex than even that, because a rotating object or an object in an orbit does in fact experience a constant acceleration (and, as well, any object sitting in a gravity well also experiences an acceleration).  Acceleration ALSO effects how time is perceived, and that is covered by Einstein&#39;s General Relativity.  Unlike Special Relativity, actually trying to solve equations for General Relativity gets ridiculously complex very very quickly as the complexity of the system being calculated increases.<br><br>-Matt", "comment_date": "2017-11-14T02:33:33Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Akash Narwal", "comment_text": "The only thing faster than light is a mexican chasing a penny", "comment_date": "2017-11-14T00:11:53Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Akul Jamwal", "comment_text": "What if i travel in direction opposite to light, then i will move at more speed relative to light than speed of light", "comment_date": "2017-11-13T15:46:56Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "crash champions", "comment_text": "@<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EPsG8td7C5k&amp;t=3m43s\">3:43</a> you have that thing in your nostril", "comment_date": "2017-11-13T12:56:54Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "J-Dragon 1141", "comment_text": "What if you take a photon and then flick it?

From these results, however, my acceptance has arisen that through the transformation and lowering of the speed of light by the half-life, also space and the chronons change themselves, according to which, then, normal space would have to change itself to hyperspace and the chronons would have to change themselves to tachyons, which continue to exist in hyperspace as the smallest units of time at their own, old speed, according to which the oldest tachyons would, therefore, have to have a speed of 44,069,497.5 kilometers per second in their own hyperspace. It also became clear to me that each dwindling away of a half-life creates its own hyperspace; thus, already seven different hyperspaces (7 half-lives = 7 X 6,347,755,102,040 = 44.434 X 10^12 years) would have to exist in our universe.<br>Furthermore, it also became clear to me that time travels into the past or future can only be associated with this fact, because somehow, the traveling object must be manipulated in such a way that the flow of chronons is steered. So for example, if tachyons with a speed of light higher than ours and present in a hyperspace or normal space would be stored around a traveling object, then it would be hurled into the past, while a flow of chronons below our current speed of light must have a journey into the future as a consequence. This has become clear to me, but the HOW, that has remained a riddle to me. It is now also clear to me that the chronons can only stay and move in normal space, while the tachyons only move in a hyperspace. This, then, along with many other things that have become perceptible to me, about which I would still like to say nothing today, however, because I\u2019m not yet sure of the results.

And this is not a good thing. But with a controller field, that acts to a line , and phase all matter in a ship, one maybe able to skip space. So it is not really braking any light speed. But such a ship could use semi controlled quantum jumping to move small increment very fast, and hence Look to FTL travel to a near by star.  Let me explain why semi controlled. Due to some leave of uncertainty, a system would have troubles controlling the exact direction.  But thankfully space is big and vast. so we only need to go in say that direction. For such a drive to be effective. <br>   The limit of the range of ones jumps would be based upon power and controlling ability. Okay, let me explain. To warp or shift space that craft would fry at end of its trip. but to do so in micro tiny hops. All radiation would me manageable.  And you could get the same effect. and reduce power needed to shift space.  Now like warping space quantum tunneling, has some problems attached to it.  For example, if we could do jump the distance to alpha centauri, our exit would have a bigger and bigger uncertainty with distance. <br>  To solve this we make many small hops, to get the same effect, without such a big bug of uncertainty. However, if such a drive could be built, it would have problems where, space and gravity are changing in saturation, so to would this drives control ability change. <br>   Hope you enjoyed this.

So if we&#39;re moving at C minus 5 meters/s fast, we would take infinite energy to go 5 meters/s in the same direction. <br><br>So... if we&#39;re moving at a speed close to C and we make a space ship and go somewhere at 1/2C, and then collect space junk, asteroids etc and build a new planet, we&#39;ll be on a planet that we AGAIN call 0. Then we build a new rocket on it and go somewhere. Repeat as many times as you want, you&#39;ll speed up a million times away from a 0 speed point to 1/2C in the same direction. So relatively to each new 0 point you&#39;ll gain 1/2C. 1000000/2C in sum. It won&#39;t take infinite energy either, it&#39;ll be 1mil x E necessary to gain 1/2C.

The electromagnetic force would work just fine for an object traveling at the speed of light - because <b>that object</b> doesn&#39;t know its traveling that fast. I don&#39;t know where you got the idea that the EM force would break down at near-light-speeds. The ultimate answer is that <b>you</b> can indeed move faster than the speed of light, meaning that you can get from point A to point B as fast as you want, as long as you have enough energy to get you there, that energy will be a finite amount. To an <b>outside</b> observer tho, you will never get beyond the speed of light because of how <b>time</b> works. The limits related to the speed of light are fundamentally related to time. I&#39;m baffled that you didn&#39;t mention that. Epiphany fail.<br><br>If all you&#39;re trying to say is that no spinning fiber can possibly hold up to something going the speed of light, and therefore having an infinite force - its not really an epiphany.

What the Theory of Relativity says, is that nothing with rest mass can reach the speed of light, like a ship - photons have no mass, only a relativistic mass, and thus they move at c. And nothing that contains actuall information and/or energy can be faster than c. Hypothetically, you can create certain objects, which are always moving faster than the speed of light, but those would travel back in time, which breaks physical laws. Those exist only in math. However, what is a lot more accurate, is to see the speed of light as the uper limit for causality.

Very interesting, but I believe it has long been known to theoretical physicists that even if you could somehow have a purely unbendable, unbreakable, indestructible very long rod,  the tip of it would still &quot;bend&quot; and lag behind, due to length contraction and other relativistic effects. So even an infinitely strong pure solid rod, defined only by its mass and size and unconstrained by any constituent electrons or photons, still cannot exceed the speed of light if swung like some cosmic lever of Archimedes.<br><br>Also surprised that conservation of angular momentum was not mentioned in the example of the spinning Elon Musk whatever and the carbon nanotubes. If a compact thing is rotating, and then spreads itself out perpendicular to the axis of its rotation, then its rate of rotation is going to decrease. So unspooling two threads of carbon nanotube out of opposing ends is going to slow the rate of rotation. Maybe since the nanotubes are small molecules and the satellite is a large-ish macroscopic object this seems like it couldn&#39;t do much, and I&#39;m tired and don&#39;t really care to do math to check it, but relativity would certainly confound it in one way if not another (again, probably without even having to analyze it on the basis of its atoms). Even though the nanotubes have a very small mass and the central spinning satellite has almost all of the mass, if it&#39;s spinning so fast the tips have relativistic speed (say 10% c) then probably almost all of the angular momentum of the system is going to be due to the ends of the tubes. For a less dramatic example, the Sun has 99% of the Solar System&#39;s mass, but the planets have 99% of the Solar System&#39;s angular momentum.", "comment_date": "2016-05-13T07:47:11Z", "likes_count": 4}, {"comment_by": "420 sUbS wItH nO sUbScRiBeRs ChAlLeNgE", "comment_text": "Did he say 6000 not fully grown starving Africans?", "comment_date": "2016-05-13T04:51:23Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Steve Chachere", "comment_text": "R u vsauce", "comment_date": "2016-05-11T23:25:44Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Shaheen Mongam", "comment_text": "I don&#39;t know how we found out that some distant galaxies are moving faster than light, but those are also made up of mater and the photon principle you described should affect them also.

However, there&#39;s a little clever wordplay thing here... because NOTHING - i.e. SPACE - can go faster than light. In other words, you yourself may not be able to go faster than light, but SPACE can do whatever the hell it wants, because it&#39;s NOTHING. The key isn&#39;t to move YOUR SHIP to faster than light - it&#39;s to move the space AROUND your ship faster than light. You&#39;re not moving at FTL, but the space around you is.<br><br>Imagine space is an ocean and your ship is a surfer. First, we&#39;ll make the ocean &quot;smooth&quot; - no waves, no ripples, just a calm, smooth surface with no breeze to kick up any waves. For this demo, we&#39;ll set the speed of &quot;light&quot; at, let&#39;s say, 20 mph. On a still surface with no waves, the surfer can try all he wants to move at speeds greater than 20 mph, but he just can&#39;t. It&#39;s because the water resists his acceleration proportional to how quickly he&#39;s moving. Trying to accelerate to 20 mph or faster would require more energy than the surfer can exert, so he can&#39;t move faster than 20 mph.<br><br>Now we give the ocean &quot;waves&quot; that the surfer can &quot;ride&quot;. All of a sudden, it&#39;s a different story. The surfer is now able to accelerate to speeds greater than 20 mph, but he&#39;s not putting in any energy to accelerate. Why is he able to move at that speed when, just before, we said that on a smooth surface he could not go faster than 20 mph or even reach that speed?<br><br>Simple, it&#39;s not himself that&#39;s accelerating him, it&#39;s the water. Remember, the SURFER can&#39;t move more than 20 mph, but the WATER isn&#39;t bound by those rules and can do what it wants. All the surfer has to do is pick an area with a wave - or, if he has enough energy, make his OWN wave - and ride that wave. That will accelerate him to a speed faster than &quot;light&quot; if light moves at 20 mph - but remember, he&#39;s not accelerating, it&#39;s the water around him accelerating him to that speed. All he&#39;s doing is riding the wave.<br><br>What I have just described is a majorly slowed-down version of a device we&#39;re trying to create - it&#39;s called, oh gee, an Alcubiere Drive.", "comment_date": "2016-04-06T08:07:11Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Patrick Star", "comment_text": "If there&#39;s nothing faster than light,how did the dark get there first?", "comment_date": "2016-04-06T07:57:38Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "truckthiss", "comment_text": "time dilation would cause the spinning rod to appear to spiral. however the way it spirals would depend on perspective.

I&#39;ve got another proposal for you, however, that in principle could allow something to seem to go faster than the speed of light, but without violating any of the limitations as you described, even EM forces.  This is an idea Feynman was apparently playing around with shortly before he died.  He gave up on the idea because he couldn&#39;t come up with any means to test it.  However, the principles seem sound.  Here goes.  Feynman stated that there are amplitudes that exist for every particle to travel faster than the speed of light.  However, these amplitudes never emerge, and thus are never observed in reality because the amplitudes cancel out.  That doesn&#39;t mean they aren&#39;t real, however.  As an equivalent example, take optical grating.  In nature under typical conditions, you will never see a photon &quot;bouncing&quot; from areas of a mirror that are blocked from the direct light source.  However, by carefully removing areas of the reflective surface that cancel out the amplitudes for light to be returned from those areas actually causes these amplitudes to appear.  That is how we get holographs, like the 3-d picture on your common bank card.  So, then, what if it were possible to &quot;grate&quot; space/time in the same way?  In principle, you would be able to &quot;remove&quot; selected areas in front of the object you want to move in such a way that the object would be able to move through the remaining space much faster than the speed of light.  But of course, the kicker is that space/time is not a simple reflecting surface, and in fact in order to do this you would first have to establish that space/time was indeed quantized, and we aren&#39;t there yet.", "comment_date": "2016-02-02T00:06:45Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "mhgvh Hbbhc", "comment_text": "Tachyons can go faster than the speed of light", "comment_date": "2016-02-01T21:46:17Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "peppermomint", "comment_text": "If you could hypothetically travel at the speed of light, would your vision freeze because your eyes aren&#39;t receiving photons anymore?", "comment_date": "2016-02-01T02:05:40Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Alie Savvo", "comment_text": "what if i just tied like my car to a beam of light lol", "comment_date": "2016-01-31T21:53:59Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "V Zero", "comment_text": "How bout the speed of darkness?", "comment_date": "2016-01-31T15:51:57Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Jack Medrek", "comment_text": "On that last idea, what if you could somehow make dark matter visible?

The speed of light itself isn&#39;t constant, everything that it interacts with changes its speed, including gravity. And if you follow the proposition that electrical charges are communicated by photons then the basis of all matter would be light itself.  Any matter potentially accelerated to light speed would become light itself because it would degenerate into its simplest form.  If all matter is made of light then the speed of light is relative to gravitational influences on the observer.  The observer would record the same speed as a data point on the moon as on the earth because the every atom of the observer&#39;s body and all test equipment would be subject to the same gravitational relativity.  The speed would record the same on the moon as on the Earth even though relative to each other they would be different.  In other words, every particle of everything that exists is already statically vibrating at the speed of light.  Everything is moving at the speed of light, however it isn&#39;t really the speed of light that is the constant but the vibrational frequency of photons throughout all of space and matter.  Which would also mean that time couldn&#39;t be physically traveled through because it doesn&#39;t physically exist.  We recognize time because we record the changes in the forms of matter all around us, and we can predict things based on the frequency of the repeating changes. But that makes time itself simply a recording of what exists, how it exists, when it changes and how often within the vibrational constant certain things occur.

If you manage to spin the entire ship like frisbee at 10 000 RPM then the gravity will not be able to catch the craft and will be able to travel distances for seconds where light normaly will took years.

Information could be ultimate heavy or fast as light, photon are the lightest materia, his energy is mostly speed and light. Speed, light, bonding, any form of energie is information, its undulation keeps partameters, that define the form of information. Mass or speed, impulse, local momentum, charge. The parameters we call quantumnumbers. Information is an ondulation, a wave-spectrum, just like a rainbow. But a rainbow keeps more information as a human eye is able too percive. So probable information might be bonded in an spectrum, that we didnt have completely percived yet. We say, the spectrum of information is edged from rest mass as the ultimate heavies form of energy to nearly massless information, which appears in speed and light. Anyway, the information is a frequency-depended form. So, probable there are more frequencies than those, who scales light, or those, which rates quantum numbers in bonding or magnetic energie or a local momentum. Information seems to be more than massenergy, defined by quantumatributes of elemtary particles. Information might be contained in units, which appers in particles and there atributes we know as materia on the one side, but probably there is energy represented in quantumnumbers-defined units, which assign information=energy beyond materia. Units appearing in frequencies, which signify non-material information. Such information is beyond the materia speed limit. And its information is mass- and timesless or time-independed. Differen frequancies mark different channels, so multiple information can be transponded. Its unpossible to measure it in material \u00a0interaction prozess. Humans recive those channels in 7 chakras. (everybody can feel=recive them). Those chakras are assigned to recive extended frenquencies. Those frequencies defines a spectrum of time- and mass-less information, rated in different channels. Our chakras recive and decrypt or decode that information, that can not be measured and standardized. So in this case, information can be faster than lightenergie. Timeless information is permanent. Thats the reason, why i can recive information instantly, examply a beloved person dies. Regardless of local distance, that information is not linear-causal but permanent and instant. Further we can recive information from ancesters or what happend long ago just like Things that will happen. Thats all information we can not bond in materia only.

Your car remains stationary (speaking relatively now), but to an observer, &quot;you&quot; (the car-road-driver unit) are actually going 120 mph.

And we need to define what velocity is, velocity is the rate of change of distance between two points. Lets think about this experiment, you have a light bulb emitting photons in the speed of light in all directions, meaning that relatively to the bulb every single photon is moving at the same speed, but what happens if we change the focus to one of the photons? Then the light bulb would be seemingly traveling away from the photon at the speed of light and a photon opposite to the would be traveling at twice the speed of light. How is that possible? Well the answer is actually quite interesting, because the two photons are relatively moving from each other in over the speed of light, the information about the very existence of the other one doesn&#39;t reach it. And are since unaffected by each other. This raises the question about a possible faster than light travel. If you could somehow move or warp the universe itself around you instead of traveling inside it doesn&#39;t, according to classical physics, to move or have a velocity relative to the universe. And since if you don&#39;t even have a velocity, you don&#39;t reach the speed of light. Even though you are reaching a destination from a huge distance in a very short time, its even less than short, you arrive before you even left. It is called time dilation and is explained by Einstein&#39;s special theory of relativity, i won&#39;t go into the details here, but if you are covering a distance faster then it would take for light you have traveled back in time, think about this: you detonate a bomb on earth, powerful enough to destroy the planet, at a point of time and then, during the final moment of earth, instantly traveling to Mars you would see the earth peacefully sitting in the sky (if you could see it that is, but you know it is there). Then all of a sudden you see earth explode from the bomb you detonated on earth, meaning that in earths timeline you were both on earth as well as on mars as you pushed the button but according to your own timeline you pushed the button and then traveled to see the same earth you are standing on.

Does light going fast than speed of light count?<br>as in a galaxy moving away from us will have some light emitting emitting away from us as well.\u00a0<br><br>2. Does speed mean relatively or actually how fast something is going. For instance an immobile object will likely see us as moving way faster than light while for us we will see (but not really cause you know too fast) an object moving faster than light.<br><br>3. If it is about communication then we could have one galaxy moving towards us at 3/4 speed of light and our galaxy moving toward it at 3/4 speed of light allowing us to get closer to the galaxy at a speed faster than light.<br><br>4. Ok, this one is ridiculously theoretical so I wont count it but I just want to say it. What if particles far smaller than the ones we can notice even with our most advanced technology move faster than photons. Who knows why these theoretical particles move so fast but who knows why photons move so fast (I don&#39;t know if anyone knows). I guess while we are on theoretical stuff we can mention if there was some new matter we found like dark matter or something that keeps itself together in a way that allows passing the speed of light.<br><br>5. Ok so gravity accelerates stuff towards other stuff. So what if there is a large enough space where a lone photon and one object can coexist. So the photons starts off very far away from this object and is headed towards the object. The object will pull on the photon possibly accelerating its speed towards it. Also would a regular object a much larger object in the same situation get similar results. Doesn&#39;t matter if the object falls apart as it reaches the other object.<br><br>6. This is a simple one and likely is not a way but might as well mention it. What about having a flashlight or any other photon emitting object and simply moving it forward in the direction the light is going. I suppose this could be related to having a hose shoot out water and then pushing the hose forward.<br><br>7. Finally my last try for now is vibration.

This is truly amazing as a concept. I mean, even the physicists were surprised when they thought they found neutrinos travelling faster than light but it turned out that their apparatus was calibrated incorrectly and that actually it is proving the speed of light. I don&#39;t know why he keeps saying inertia I though it was the moment of the inertia that was important in circular motion but whatever. The photons between the particles? You mean the electrostatic attraction between the \u00a0proton and the electron? What&#39;s that got to do with c? Also wouldn&#39;t the linear velocity be different from thee angular speed anyway, so what are we talking about here when we&#39;re talking about centripetal acceleration? Also wouldn&#39;t the carbon nanotubes / graphene nanotubes / space-magic matter be completely and utterly dependent on getting enough energy to move the mass faster than the speed of light? Why can&#39;t we just use light? Or is it because of the example you made earlier? The spot technically isn&#39;t moving at all it just looks like it is but the photons are actually travelling at the speed of light (slightly less than that before exiting Earth but approximately so) and hitting the moon... In different places so it&#39;s not moving at the speed of light. Or is it that this is the reason why you can&#39;t use energy? If you&#39;re worried about the &quot;electrostatic interaction&quot; why can&#39;t you just use on particle, such as a lepton of a quark is it because the length of the spire matters due to the distance from the axis of rotation necessary to increase the centripetal acceleration to make the matter move faster than the speed of light? Because I thought that nothing could go faster than the speed of light due to needing an infinite amount of energy to move it because its mass increases the closer to the speed of light you get due to quantum effects.

In tunneling, the particle does not have enough energy to get &quot;over&quot; the barrier, but somehow it does.

That &quot;barrier&quot; can occupy a physical distance of many nanometers, up to more than a micron.\u00a0<br>The interesting bit is that the particles seem to get through that distance in zero time. This has been measured (I have the reference someplace). Others have shown that microwave photons can be excited to tunnel at superluminal speeds.

If one accepts the patently obvious that alien life-forms have been visiting earth fro millenia then it is another obvious hole in the no FTL-theory of Einstein. This may be disregarded if you like, but gravity may not be dis-regarded.<br>2. &quot;According to Einstein ...&quot; ? What? He&#39;s infallible? The man didn&#39;t accept Quantum Mechanics ... which (QM) has never been dis-proven experimentally ... so all of his work COMPLETELY IGNORED quantum mechanics - which is the core set of laws by which the known universe works. This means that anything he said which relates to photonic theory is incomplete.<br>3. The fastest speed at which a force propagates through an object is the speed of sound? Did this guy graduate from playschool? Electrical cables propagate an electromagnetic force throughout them at ... the speed of light.<br>4. Piggybacking on Hawking&#39;s book? What has Hawking ever come up with ? Hawking radiation? Wow. A pivotal moment in science. Amongst the scientific community Hawking is a joke. He turns up at conferences, makes radical unfounded statements with zero proof and then trundles off again leaving a wake of scientists shaking their heads going &quot;Oh not again, Stephen ...&quot;. The man captured the public&#39;s imagination because he&#39;s in a wheelchair and talks like a robot, not for any actual scientific ground-breaking work.

Would the object have surpassed its own light and we are seeing its image long after it has passed or is it projectng an image a fixed distance behind itself (therefore could we measure the distance between the object and its image to calculate its speed). Could we even identify the object?. Not sure if that makes sense but im sure my lack of understanding in the area is clear. Thanks for the videos and comments.
