Which diamond is high pressure, so candle is high pressure region where it is from, so I am sure all candle is same density which it burns off, so in middle of flame is diamonds is breaking apart into smoke. So that means at lower level, the pressure is very high but at very small space. So, it is not zero, so it is about pressure as depth to amount of resistance. So, candle is from low pressure region, so the resistance is very low, except at micro-space. Which it can burn off, so the fire can&#39;t burn normal diamond that you can see because the resistance is too high for fire to be burn off. That means if you look nano-diamond in microscope or smaller, and you use a machine with a twitter or something and you squeeze it, it can crush with your power. So, that mean pressure do depend by density and size of density, not either one alone. So, that means all carbon is diamond like, which diamond has certain pattern. But the amount of resistance, per space, do matter. So, carbon is diamond.
