Cause if you touch a piece of lets say 100\u00b0C  tin foil it wont feel as hot as touching 100\u00b0C brick although tin foil conducts heat bether than brick. Theres one other difference: the overall heat capacity. A big brick will have more energy at 100\u00b0C than a small piece of tin foil..And thus at the moment you touch the tin foil, it will be very soon as warm as your hand,but zhe brick will stay hot. Of course with big object this effect isnt that huge any more,but at the surface of the object it will matter. Imagane a substance with  medium heat conductivity, but very very high heat capacity. If you touch it, it will feel very hot, and the surface wont get cold soon. So you will get burned. But now imagine a substance with medium heat conductivity, but very low heat capacity. This substance wont burn you, cause at the point you touched it, the surface will be cold very soon.<br>I think with air this gets important. If you have got just very slowly moving air (it moves only because of heat differences) Its heat conductivity is at a medium range (it can move freely, thus the heat conductivity isnt  as low as it was, if it was enclosed in lets say styrofoam). But its heat capacity is low. So it wont burn you. But if you&#39;ve got wet air, ots heat conductivity goes up,and also its heat capacity goes up. So it feels way hotter. If you only had high heat conductivity (wind), it wouldnt feel as hot, as it feels if the heat capacity( wet) is high.

However, I believe that because of the difference in thermal conductivity, the portion of the object in contact with the human hand would actually have a different temperature, because as soon as the human hand at 37\u00b0C comes into contact with the object at 15\u00b0C, heat will begin to flow from the hand to the object, and establish a temperature gradient in the object that cools with distance from the point of contact. The slope of the temperature gradient would be inversely related to the thermal conductivity of the object, with the result that at the points of contact,  the low conductivity book would have a noticeably higher temperature than the hard drive. If both objects were at thermal equilibrium and then picked up at the same time, they would feel the same at the moment of first contact, but the temperatures at the contact points would rapidly diverge.<br><br>Even if Derek had stated clearly that he was talking only about the bulk average temperature of each object, there would still be a difference between the two after a period of human contact, but that difference would be related to the heat capacity of the objects, and I believe it would develop much more slowly. I don&#39;t know anything about the heat capacity of paper or the bulk heat capacity of a hard drive (which would of course contain some dead air to complicate things) so I won&#39;t wager a guess as to which would actually be warmer, but I expect there would be a small difference there as well!<br><br>I have no complaints about the results of the cake versus tin experiment, though. I&#39;m sure a temperature difference would develop due to differences in exposed surface area and the different contact materials (stove top vs. ambient air) but in terms of what was being measured and discussed, I would conclude that these differences would be irrelevant. :-)", "comment_date": "2017-04-27T23:20:03Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Peter Punterino", "comment_text": "&quot;I&#39;ve just learned something&quot;<br>Yay!", "comment_date": "2017-04-26T03:54:20Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Rhys Keir", "comment_text": "his mom sounds South African", "comment_date": "2017-04-24T20:26:51Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Thrill98", "comment_text": "your mother is happy to have you ;3", "comment_date": "2017-04-24T18:58:00Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Ahmad AlNuaimi", "comment_text": "People who are flipping about the cold thing are so sad.

Two different materials exposed to heat for the same amount of time do not necessarily reach the same temperature.  Materials have two major properties that affect their respective temperature:  The colour of the material decided the amount of heat reflected or absorbed and the properties of the material also decide on the amount of heat absorbed (and retained).  The best example of this is metal vs ceramic.  But at the extreme temperatures we can more easily deduce the differences ie: At, say, 700 degrees c some metals will have melted into liquid where ceramic will still be intact.  In fact if you notice when he first measured the temperature of the cake as it came out of the oven, he did in fact get 2 significant different temperatures and then he went on to re-measure the temperature as the metal more quickly re-radiated its heat (cooled down quicker) than  the cake and at a certain moment they had about the same temperature.  He should have continued capturing temperatures and logging the temperatures and one would very easily see that  metal would continue to cool down faster than the cake.", "comment_date": "2016-05-23T17:08:51Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Gjallahorn Gjallahorn", "comment_text": "Awesome!", "comment_date": "2016-05-21T11:47:28Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Asyraf Ebo", "comment_text": "hahaha great", "comment_date": "2016-05-18T10:42:51Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "liang chen", "comment_text": "you have to adjust the emissivity to take correct infrared measurements on different material.", "comment_date": "2016-05-15T20:57:39Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Hamzalihi", "comment_text": "You said that the cake was cooked, its called baked.

The surface can be slightly hotter because it&#39;s dry, but the close contact with the inside still keeps it around that point. Metal cookware has no such limitations. The reason your readings were so close is because you measured the surface of the cake and a part of the tin that was in direct contact with \u2013 and therefore cooled by \u2013 the cake.

Since it is a vacuum, it can&#39;t conduct heat from your body. You will still lose heat through radiation, but it is a much slower process for our bodies. So the actual sensation of the &#39;temperature&#39; of space would be quite pleasant when the sun is eclipsed behind the Earth (of course, the sensation of having all of the gases in your bodies forcibly expelled from all of your orifices at once and then blacking out from shock and asphyxiation will be decidedly less pleasant). If you were to somehow remain conscious but exposed to the vacuum of space, it would over time start to feel quite cold as you lose more and more heat. But it&#39;s far from the &#39;instafreeze&#39; environment it&#39;s depicted in various media.<br><br>But speaking of the sun, this is where it really starts to defy expectation. In space, you face the full, unfiltered radiation of the sun. The sensation of the sunlight without any cooler ambient temperature would feel akin to the sensation of sunlight in the Sahara desert (an extremely dry environment), plus unfiltered radiation in the ultraviolet spectrum will make the sensation even hotter and the dangers of sunburn far more immediately dangerous. In fact, the primary heat-related issue that had to be addressed for astronaut suits wasn&#39;t just keeping them warm in the coldness of space, but keeping them cool in the heat of the unfiltered sun.<br><br>This applies to things like the space station and probes as well. Their electronics and processes create heat, which sometimes cannot be radiated out into the vacuum of space faster than the heat is being generated.

If it is losing heat very quickly, it will feel cold. If it is losing heat very slowly, and/or receiving heat from its environment, it will feel warm. and this is all relative to your body&#39;s ability to replenish lost heat and rid itself of excess heat.", "comment_date": "2011-06-30T14:37:40Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "terralynn9", "comment_text": "I don&#39;t understand why you don&#39;t have more views/subs - this is awesome.", "comment_date": "2011-06-30T11:58:34Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "xDingey", "comment_text": "ahh.. the cake..
