Here is the proof. I have more. THE PHYSICAL NECESSITY OF E=MC2 AS F=MA (ON BALANCE) IN AND WITH TIME, AS ELECTROMAGNETISM/energy is gravity:<br><br><br>Consider what is THE SUN. NOW, carefully consider what is the MIDDLE DISTANCE IN/OF SPACE. Finally, consider the SPEED OF LIGHT (c). Invisible AND VISIBLE SPACE in fundamental equilibrium and balance NECESSARILY IS the MIDDLE DISTANCE in/of SPACE. (HALF of any given sphere may be VISIBLE.) Consider what is THE MAN who IS standing on what is THE EARTH/ground, and carefully consider what is THE EYE in conjunction WITH what is BALANCED BODILY/VISUAL EXPERIENCE !!! (The sky is BLUE, AND what is THE EARTH is ALSO BLUE. In fact, the human body is very slightly less dense than water.) Now, touch AND feeling BLEND; AS gravity/acceleration involves BALANCED inertia/INERTIAL RESISTANCE; AS ELECTROMAGNETISM/energy is gravity. Accordingly, the falling man feels no gravity; AND objects (AND MEN) fall at the SAME RATE (neglecting air resistance, of course); AS &quot;mass&quot;/ENERGY involves BALANCED inertia/INERTIAL RESISTANCE consistent with/as what is BALANCED electromagnetic/gravitational force/ENERGY; AS E=MC2 is F=ma ON BALANCE !!! THEREFORE, gravity AND ELECTROMAGNETISM/energy are linked AND BALANCED opposites; AS ELECTROMAGNETISM/energy is gravity. (The stars AND PLANETS are POINTS in the night sky.) Gravity is clearly ELECTROMAGNETISM/energy on balance. Therefore, the rotation of WHAT IS THE MOON matches it&#39;s revolution ! E=MC2 IS F=ma ON BALANCE. This NECESSARILY represents, INVOLVES, AND DESCRIBES what is possible/potential AND actual IN BALANCE, AS ELECTROMAGNETISM/energy is gravity. TIME dilation ULTIMATELY proves ON BALANCE that E=MC2 IS F=ma, AS ELECTROMAGNETISM/energy is gravity. Indeed, time is NECESSARILY possible/potential AND actual IN BALANCE; AS ELECTROMAGNETISM/energy is gravity; AS E=MC2 IS clearly F=ma ON BALANCE. The stars AND PLANETS are POINTS in the night sky. I have explained why the planets move away very, very, very slightly in relation to what is THE SUN. Carefully consider what is the SPEED OF LIGHT (c) on balance. Carefully consider what is THE SUN. Great. Very importantly, outer &quot;space&quot; involves full inertia; AND it is fully invisible AND black !! E=MC2 is CLEARLY proven to be F=ma ON BALANCE of NECESSITY, AS ELECTROMAGNETISM/energy is gravity. TIME dilation ULTIMATELY proves ON BALANCE that E=MC2 IS F=ma, AS ELECTROMAGNETISM/energy is gravity. (Gravity is clearly ELECTROMAGNETISM/energy.) So, BALANCED inertia/INERTIAL RESISTANCE is fundamental. (&quot;Mass&quot;/ENERGY IS GRAVITY. ELECTROMAGNETISM/energy is gravity. E=MC2 is CLEARLY F=ma on balance.) GRAVITATIONAL force/ENERGY IS proportional to (or BALANCED with/as) inertia/INERTIAL RESISTANCE, AS E=MC2 IS F=ma ON BALANCE; AS ELECTROMAGNETISM/energy is gravity. It all CLEARLY makes perfect sense, AS BALANCE AND completeness go hand in hand. Gravity is ELECTROMAGNETISM/energy. E=MC2 is CLEARLY F=ma on balance, AS gravity AND ELECTROMAGNETISM/energy are linked AND BALANCED opposites; AS gravity/acceleration involves BALANCED inertia/INERTIAL RESISTANCE; AS TIME dilation ULTIMATELY proves ON BALANCE that ELECTROMAGNETISM/energy is gravity. GREAT !!! INSTANTANEITY is thus FUNDAMENTAL to what is the FULL and proper UNDERSTANDING of physics/physical experience. The ultimate MATHEMATICAL unification of physics/physical experience combines, BALANCES, and includes opposites. I have clearly mathematically unified physics/physical experience, AS TIME is NECESSARILY possible/potential AND actual IN BALANCE; AS E=MC2 is F=ma ON BALANCE; AS ELECTROMAGNETISM/energy is gravity. Gravity is clearly ELECTROMAGNETISM/energy ON BALANCE.<br><br><br>By Frank DiMeglio", "comment_date": "2021-11-16T10:40:57Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "simple art", "comment_text": "Gravtaional waves are ripples", "comment_date": "2021-11-16T08:07:16Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "simple art", "comment_text": "I like  physics  but don&#39;t know I am good or not cause I am a average student not scientist", "comment_date": "2021-11-16T08:03:48Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Solaris _", "comment_text": "Lasers are cool", "comment_date": "2021-11-16T04:38:10Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Chertfoot", "comment_text": "I don&#39;t think the &quot;violent&quot; terminology is accurate or really appropriate.

So i&#39;ve been reading up a lot about gravitational waves lately and there are a few things i want to point out. <br>In this video it was a bit indicated as if shot noise was the only type of quantum noise, but it isn&#39;t. There is also something we call radiation pressure noise. This is a noise source that comes from photons transfering their momentum into the test mass (mirror) and moving it. This noise can be reduced by lowering the power of the laser. This sadly is a problem with the shot noise. I need a high power laser to lower shot noise but a low power laser to decrease radiation pressure noise. Luckily a few years ago a solution was found to this. In systems we now use what is called a partially transmitting mirror. This mirror keeps reflecting the light send it and making it do round trips. This builds up the effective power of the laser while still having a low power laser. So using this trick quantum noise in its entirety can be reduced. <br>You also indicated that if a gravitational wave was detected the locations in america would detect them at the same time. This is untrue as it depends on where the gravitational wave came from. There could be a small delay. <br>There are also more different kinds of noise that have multiple tricks that can be used to decrease said noise. I won&#39;t go into any detail about them as they weren&#39;t mentioned in this video. But i will say that one of the more important noise sources was left out here, which is thermal noise. Thermal noise is at the moment one of the bigger fields in GW because of the coating used and its inhomogeneous dissipation properties. <br>Anyway. I doubt anyone will ever see this comment so i&#39;m gonna stop here. <br>For the person that does see this, i hope you enjoyed this small addition to the video", "comment_date": "2021-10-01T15:38:49Z", "likes_count": 40}, {"comment_by": "Syke", "comment_text": "Weird to think that given the age of that signal, we are probably not the first civilization to have stumbled upon it.", "comment_date": "2021-10-01T00:54:58Z", "likes_count": 2}, {"comment_by": "Heck yeah science", "comment_text": "<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iphcyNWFD10&amp;t=4m48s\">4:48</a> his snap remind of electric spark", "comment_date": "2021-09-30T23:57:02Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Christopher Bachman", "comment_text": "What if it&#39;s dark energy waves, instead?<br>Ever expanding space time.<br>Just saying...<br>Kinda hard to study with so few occurrences detected.<br>Probably shouldn&#39;t make too many wild-eyed guesses about it.", "comment_date": "2021-09-30T07:32:26Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "\u05d0\u05e8\u05d9\u05d0\u05dc \u05e2\u05d3\u05df", "comment_text": "What a waste of time and money, so that a couple of scientists can measure changes of light the width of a hair.

Infact without dark matter and &quot;gravity&quot; we would be torn to shreds... The thing is that gravity is a reaction caused by rotation and matter and if you ever tried spinning something sticky of a spoon or anything similar you could see that the thicker it is the more it sticks... If you were to look inside a drop of let&#39;s say honey you would see that nothing inside is being affected by the momentum... It&#39;s immune... And this is exactly what happens to us but we have to think much bigger... We are a speck in the milky way which spins around a massive black hole... Compare a spoon to a molecule inside honey here... But we are still too small we have to think much much bigger... The black hole spins around another black hole and this one likely around yet another so big we can&#39;t imagine it... But now when you take this size example you can start seeing where this is going... Put the spoon into a massive jar of honey and turn it... The honey will stick and get pulled against it as if you created gravity... There is so much dark matter around us and it sticks to the planet..  The galaxy..  All the black holes... We are not gravitated onto the planet by a pull force but by a pressure that we cannot comprehend... It&#39;s so thick yet we can&#39;t even see it...

To make matters worse, what I&#39;m about to write will cause some to accuse me of being a Luddite, or worse. But I forge ahead. The earth is, by most estimates, about four billion years old. Humans have been around for a tiny fraction of that; maybe a couple of million years. These events, these collisions of super massive black holes have, likewise, been occurring for BILLIONS (imagine Carl Sagan saying that) years. So, here&#39;s my question: What is the VALUE of knowing that an event that occurred more than a billion years ago caused this ripple space-time such that we would be able to detect it?  How will that knowledge be used to improve the lives of not just astrophysicists, engineers, mathematicians, astronomers and their support staff and the contractors  and construction crews hired to build these detection devices; but how will all of this  improve the lives of those who PAID FOR IT?  I am a curator of bits and pieces of curiosities; arcane facts and statistics which I have, on occasion, used to impress others. But I have also managed to annoy others who expressed their annoyance by calling me a &#39;know-it-all&#39; and much MUCH worse. Yet, that capacity for knowing arcane facts has never once  actually improved my life or the lives of others beyond the momentary personal satisfaction I experience or that others may experience. It doesn&#39;t put food on my table or shoes on my children&#39;s feet or a roof over our heads.

The incredulous tone in the hosts voice is real \u2014 and should be, because these \u201cresearch\u201d scientists are little more than glory hounds seeking fame &amp; fortune at the expense of the gullible. <br><br>Here are some sources of error in such ridiculously precise measurements:<br><br>1) Tidal forces<br>2) Inner core, molten dynamics<br>3) tectonic plate movement<br>4) earthquake tremors<br>5) solar flares<br>6) magnetospheric snap back<br>7) global lightning storms (aggregate)<br>8) temperature<br>9) pressure<br>10) humidity<br>11) wind<br>12) local traffic (not just trains)<br>13) noise from jets at 35,000ft<br>14) noise from birds, dogs, bears, etc.<br>15) planetary orbits<br>16) galactic rotation<br>17) waves from galactic center<br>18) solar current sheet dynamics<br>19) electricity fluctuations (power grid)<br>20) electricity fluctuations (circuitry)<br>21) accuracy of electrical equipment<br>22) degradation in electrical equipment<br>23) mirror / polishing flaws<br>24) time required for electrons in the electrical measuring equipment to cross from one side of a microcircuit chip to the other<br>25) many others<br><br>These sources of error are at least trillions of times greater than needed to make such sensitive measurements. Care can be used to reduce some of the errors: for example, one can use a 4-point probe to compensate for differences in the length &amp; resistance of cabling to &amp; from electrical equipment, in order to improve accuracy by three or four orders of magnitude. That gets you from 1E-12 to (at best) 1E-15 accuracy (one femtoampere in any given electrical device). As reported, one needs 1E-21 accuracy - a million times greater accuracy than any electrical measurement ever confirmed. <br><br>One can make more precise measurements with photonics, but only over very small distances: not over 4 km distances needed for gravity wave detection. Fiber optic cables run over the 4 km distance here introduces more sources of systemic error. Repeaters are inserted to keep the signal integrity. Photons can be absorbed by fiber defects (impurities), so a single photon cannot be relied on to travel in the fiber strand over 4 km.<br><br>Anyway, it\u2019s a shame we have a class of scientists who are not criticizing their peers. This promotes more &amp; more dishonesty in the scientific community, so all participants in the deception make more money. Perhaps deception is too strong a word. Maybe scientists simply don\u2019t care enough to investigate fantastic claims? After all, each scientist is very busy with his and her own research to take time out to criticize others. <br><br>Here\u2019s an idea: Why don\u2019t we require every scientist to criticize 4 other papers before earning the privilege of publishing One paper of his or her own?", "comment_date": "2020-11-21T16:17:26Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "000420man4ever", "comment_text": "So imagine 100 gigawatt  lasers, OMG", "comment_date": "2020-11-21T15:13:44Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "James R", "comment_text": "Long story short, they imagined the WHOLE thing, and then wasted a whole lot of money to lie to themselves and then the world.

A mirror is an object that reflects light whereby the incidence angle is the negative reflection angle. So if it is hit with 0\u00b0 it is reflected back. two atoms could be the simplest mirror array. Imagine two atoms where one has a higher atomic energy level. Now the electron falls back to a lower level and light gets emitted. A couple of things happen. The atom will get a momentum in the other direction. Now if the targeting was correct and the second atom gets hit, it will also get a momentum then and later, when it reemits the photon. I do not got into the details of the energy changes of the photon travelling constantly bettween these &quot;mirrors&quot;. I just want to point out that these are moving away from each other if nothing holds them in their place. Second thing I want to remind people is the uncertainty of the point of emission. They say the accuracy is about a 1000th the width of a proton. How could this possibly be if the distance between the emitting electron and the nucleos must by logic be halve of the added protons and electrons width, and by nature the atomic radius. Therefore when nothing happens there will always be at least this noise, suppressing the claimed accuracy, even when you rely on the average of millions of photons where you never know the exact positions.<br>Additionally there is another point. In the clip it is said that the &quot;new light&quot; has to travel a bigger distance when the gravitational wave stretched the space before. However, the influence of the gravitational wave is still there and the way they are looking at it it seems like the space to travel is made up of 100 lego blocks and when it got stretched it is 101 blocks and therefore a bigger distance to travel. I claim it is still 100 blocks but each one stretched to 1.01 of it&#39;s original length. Now that the light is not apart from space and time but also influenced by gravitation the speed will go up to 1.01 c. This is the more inevitable the more you claim c to be constant in all frames of reference. Remember that this has been stretched by 1.01 and the speed is distance per time.<br>The more you measure, the more data you gather, the better you filter, the more likely you are to find some data that look like what you were looking for.

The theoretical Alcubierre warp drive can move faster than &#39;C&#39; (the speed of light in a vacuum)... Because physics does not limit the speed of any individual piece of spacetime compared to any other piece... I want to offer a seed of thought. - Gravity moves faster than &#39;C&#39;. - There is an old mental experiment... If the sun just vanished... We would see the sunlight for 8(+) minutes... It has been put forward that the Earth would continue to move around where the sun was at for that same 8(+) minutes because the gravity-wave from the sun would also last that long... Because of the speed of &#39;C&#39;. But if gravity, the warping of spacetime, moves faster than &#39;C&#39;... The Earth would fling out of orbit faster than the visible light from the sun would vanish. - A gravity-wave (or ripple in spacetime) is in effect an Alcubierre-style warp, with no laws of physics limiting it&#39;s speed. - I have some possible consequences to this thought. - Let&#39;s follow the birth and evolution of a particular gravity wave... I&#39;ll call him Gerard. Gerard is formed by the orbits of two massive objects and radiates outward. He behaves as we have learned that he behaves... (I am of the opinion that we have much more than that to learn yet.) But at the point where we think that he has expanded (or dissipated) to being ineffective to the matter that he encounters... The actuality of his existence is something different. He joins a vast &#39;flow&#39; of every bit of gravity ever birthed... And contributes to this flow. <b>*Amplifying the other gravity waves... As he is also amplified.*</b> This flow has eddies and back-washes where matter accumulates... And becomes (among other things) galaxies. The matter that grows in these eddies of gravity &#39;flow&#39; can be seen to move too fast for its own gravity and we think it should be spinning itself apart... But actually, the gravity that keeps the galaxies together is from the outside &#39;flow&#39; - Not the inside mass. - Dark matter does not exist... When we map the areas where we see more gravity... and call it dark matter... What we are seeing is the &#39;flow&#39; of all the gravity that was ever birthed. If we want to move to other parts of this galaxy - And even to other galaxies... We need to harness this &#39;flow&#39;... And surf. :)<br><br><b>*Amplifying the other gravity waves... As he is also amplified.*</b> - This amplifying process... Or many processes over millennia... Changes the speed that the gravity-ripple travels across the fabric of space-time. Sometimes it can be thrust a little-bit... and a little bit again, millions of times to ultimately get to a Factor of &#39;C&#39;... Not a fraction  of &#39;C&#39;. While other particular waves from a specific source might not encounter as many accelerating circumstances, and be closer to the bottom end of the speed spectrum \u2013 The lowest speed possible for a gravity-wave, is the speed of LIGHT. \u201cC\u201d. But almost any speed of any particular ebb and flow of the great gravity flow is possible. - 10(x); 1Million(x); More? There are gravitational waves that are so fast that crossing the observable universe can be done in less than a century. This flow is what moves our universe. Not &#39;dark energy&#39;.<br><br>Not all gravity begins at &#39;C&#39;. Some interaction of very large masses can cause gravity to begin at speeds that are hundreds or thousands of times faster than &#39;C&#39;. However... Usually, gravity from a single source... A sun, by itself, even a &#39;Magnetar/Neutron Star&#39; will cause gravity that is moving at &#39;C&#39;. Faster than &#39;C&#39; movement, is a by-product of gravity waves interacting over long amounts of time, or very very large gravity sources in close proximity to each other.<br><br><br>Thank You<br>Alvan T.

The electromagnetic wave is often described as saw tooth ideograph. This is not correct. It is a stream of photons orbiting an imaginary line of transit at a radius of half the wave diameter. The wave travels in this fashion because universal gravity is tugging on the stream in all directions. A wave carries  photons on it dependent on its frequency which is dependent on the amount of mass consumed to convert it into photons. A ten billion frequency wave has ten times the number of photos and thus ten time the mass of o one million frequency wave. The more photons on the wave the smaller is the diameter of the wave because it has more mass resisting universal gravity on that wave form. A wave is thus a circular motion dictated by gravity and its force Waves on our oceans and lakes have another source of gravitational attractiveness and that is the gravity of the Earth. Such wavers are pulled by universal gravity only to the extent of their resistance to it as a mass and are controlled by the rotary motion of the Earth and its gravity to the largest extent possible. These waves appear to be linear in scope because of these limitations. We see circular waves of fluids only when fluids fall toward the center of the Earth through a tubular structure.. The point being that in the universe unless limitations are imposed on a motion it will always be circular around an imaginary line of transit. Gravity does not appear to be adhering to that model. Its force is only controlled by its distance from its primary source.

The tunnels are only 4 kms long.  But in each tunnel is a device called a Fabry-Perot cavity.  This has two functions, one is to keep the light in the tunnel for nearly a millisecond so the gravity wave has more time to interact with the light.  The light bounces back and forth between two mirrors I believe 400 times, making the effectively length of the tunnel 1600 kms. <br><br><br>The other thing it does is increase the power of the laser light.  They didn&#39;t mention it in the video, but the laser is only 200 watts.  But in the Fabry-Perot cavity each refection of the light wave is in phase with the other reflections so you get constructive interference.  This increases the power of the laser light to nearly a megawatt.  <br><br><br>That poses an interesting engineering problem.  When light hits those mirrors it actually pushes them a little. And that will vary with the amount of energy in the beam.  If they don&#39;t account for that, the light itself would push the mirrors enough so the light would no longer be in phase since the distance between the mirrors would change. Also the light beam wouldn&#39;t be in the same spot anymore since the mirror is slightly tilted.

Without a relevant calibration curve it is not possible to draw any conclusions from a measured detector signal to the strength of an alleged gravitational wave. Nonetheless, in their discovery paper the LIGO-Virgo Collaboration falsely claimed to have calibrated by means of known laser input for corresponding detector displacement. They state in their discovery paper: &quot;The detector output is calibrated in strain by measuring its response to test mass motion induced by photon pressure from a modulated calibration laser beam . ... the detector response to gravitational waves is tested by injecting simulated waveforms with the calibration laser.&quot; Not only have they never published the required calibration curve, professor Karsten Danzmann of the Vigo Team confessed to professor Wolfgang Engelhardt (retired, of the Max Planck Institute), that the required calibration curve does not exist [see 1,2,3,4]. \r<br>For months Danzmann stalled. Only after he found himself potentially before a German court of law to provide the calibration data according to German law, did he confess that the necessary calibration curve does not exist. He subsequently removed the calibration paper [5] from his profile on ResearchGate.\r<br>Furthermore, GW170814 proves that their published strain curves are not measurements, but the result of simulations. They publish equal strain of 5x10^(-22) as measured on all three interferometers, but due to different orientation of Virgo with respect to the wave front, the strain in Pisa would have been much less than in the US. \r<br>Anybody can confirm Danzmann&#39;s confession as to the non-existent calibration curve by writing to him and requesting his confession anew: danzmann@<a href=\"http://aei.mpg.de/\">aei.mpg.de\r</a><br>[1] <a href=\"https://www.kritik-relativitaetstheorie.de/.../luitpold.../\">https://www.kritik-relativitaetstheorie.de/.../luitpold.../\r</a><br>[2] <a href=\"https://www.kritik-relativitaetstheorie.de/.../petition.../\">https://www.kritik-relativitaetstheorie.de/.../petition.../\r</a><br>[3] <a href=\"https://www.change.org/.../prof-karsten.../u/23649808:\">https://www.change.org/.../prof-karsten.../u/23649808:\r</a><br>[4] <a href=\"https://www.kritik-relativitaetstheorie.de/.../umstritte.../\">https://www.kritik-relativitaetstheorie.de/.../umstritte.../\r</a><br>[5] PHYSICAL REVIEW D 95, 062003 (2017)", "comment_date": "2019-10-02T23:02:07Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "TheVladikCZ TheVladikCZ", "comment_text": "please see the Cavendish experiment explanation <a href=\"https://youtu.be/_U2CCPgN6OY\">https://youtu.be/_U2CCPgN6OY</a>", "comment_date": "2019-10-02T22:44:10Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Ralph Gla\u00df", "comment_text": "Ligo is a weapon.

He said the photons in the stretched part are useless and the system works because they keep pumping light into the stretched space. This is wrong. The wavelength of the light changes but it doesn&#39;t change the speed of the light. But the distance that light needs to cover changes, so it still takes more (or less) time for the photon to travel that distance. <br><br><br>It is like a car that is 2m long travelling on a 3000m long road. Let say the middle of the car is in the middle of the road and, that means the front of the car is at the 1501m mark, that means the car needs to travel 1499m to finish the road. At that point, an enormous gravitational wave hits and stretches everything by 10%. Car is now 2.2m and the road is 3030m. The car is still in the middle, that means the front of the car is now at the 1516.1m mark. That leaves exactly 1513.9m. Gravitational wave changed the distance from 1499m to 1513.9m and even though the length of the car changed the speed of the car didn&#39;t change.

Now for the bad news, In reference to this signal( gravitational wave) here is something to consider LIGO False positive; the problem is that the methods used to Extract the signal From a sea of noise and the interpretation of such a signal. First the signal amplitude is smaller then a atomic nuclei a it must be filtered out from a sea of noise, the methods used is highly dubious, because the investigator introduces a predetermined template comparator (there are thousands of these templates) that may introduce a bias in these extractions (observations). Furthermore, the filtering processing requires a inordinate amount of data processor or data comparison in Searching for the predetermined signature of a chirps, which starts with a low and moves to a higher frequency, may also be the characteristics of many other natural phenomena, not related to gravity. There is also another problem, interpretation of the source, at is, to associate the Signal (chirps) with a Specific cosmic events (Gamma burst, x-ray emissions). There are three natural relationships: similarity, contiguity and cause and effect. Of these, the causes and effects it is the most problematic where the narrative does not have a connecting principle, but instead it is  artificially juxtaposed by the mind and not real. In other words, how many of these events could be associated artificially and are not real.

According to the graph which is posted there are roughly 13 occurrences where it peaked, so then it would mean that it would be an average of 4612km between each peak. Now the length of light for these devices are 2.4km each way, so that would mean that it&#39;s a total distance of 4.8 km worth of inductance for a single section of light takes 1.60110000166e-5 light seconds to travel along it, which is somewhere around the 16 microsecond range.<br><br>Something just doesn&#39;t add up here.

My understanding of LIGOs theory is that the distance tween the end mirrors stretches-contracts because they are loosely hanging (ie in effect in free fall) whereas the pipeline itself resists stretching-contracting by virtue of its solidness -- &amp; the solid laser likewise resists, in which case the emitted light wavelength does not change at any time -- hencely a fringeshift.

These engineers theorize that they could measure gravitational wave with lasers, as they fought for a 620 million dollar grant and budget. Many scientists said this was illogical, because of environmental anomalies that could easily warp the results. The team pulled top engineering companies to help propose LIGO. Because of this, they got approval from the National Science Board in August 2013. The only reason they claimed victory and discovery was because they testified in front of Congress to beg for help to budget this monstrosity; but in all actuality (Opinion alert ---&gt;) they did not want to look foolish. They had no Idea if the waves actually existed and only theorize that two black holes combined millions of years ago, which the waves, so call originated from, caused this ripple effect; which in fact, the waves should have never reached earth, simply because of the rate of dissipation of such an improbable wave would be close to light speed. The fact is, Black holes existence is still a theory, as the definition of black holes changed over time and no Telescope has actually peered into a black hole. <br>Their solution, to keep earth environmental anomalies from causing changes, was to dangle the mirrors on a thin string. The fact that the unit&#39;s lasers weigh over 100 metric tonnes and will move with the earth at the lowest tremors recorded, has not been addressed, which would affect the results. This is why no project has a perfect quantitative number, and at the values, they were looking for,  are too small to give any infinitive results without error. you always round up the results, because environment creates errors to the smallest numbers. The earth constantly quakes, due to the high activity of the inner core. <br>Gravity is still a theory regardless of it&#39;s known value to physics, and it can not be measured with any device outside gravity itself.<br>But the one anomaly, that most of the science world is saying, is magnetic waves affect light,  and travel all over the universe.", "comment_date": "2018-10-09T06:27:27Z", "likes_count": 12}, {"comment_by": "Croaking Frog", "comment_text": "How do they know the stretching space time indicates that two black holes collided?

Most obviously, the power added to the beam is only a 200 W. The power of the beam bouncing back and forth may be a megawatt, but that&#39;s kind of a funny measure, because as soon as you stick something into the beam the it would absorb the amount of energy stored as bouncing light, then the power of the beam hitting the obstruction is only 200 W. Since the power is constant and light can go through the detector 60 000 times in a second, I believe this means that the instantaneously stored energy as light will be only 1 MW/60 000 or about 30 J. This will not vapourize anybody&#39;s head; nor will the 200 J over the next second. Boiling water requires 2 MJ/L.<br><br>A 200 W laser can plausibly set your hair on fire or you can lose your eyesight if the beam is small enough. But of course, the beam is HUGE on LIGO. Just consider the Heisenberg uncertainty principle; if the beam goes through a tiny apperture you have determined the position of the photons and can know very little about their momentum, so the beam spreads out (diffraction) and you get a spread in the frequency of light. The LIGO beam from the look of the optics is about 30 cm wide. It&#39;s a gaussian beam so a lot of that surface won&#39;t be very strongly illuminated.<br><br>If you close your eyes and stick your head in you will be hit by 30 J as fast as you can stick your head in and 200 W over time. If  you move your head around continously those 200 W should only feel a few times hotter than sunshine on a summer noon. You&#39;d probably be pretty alright.<br><br>Even a much more powerful continuous laser will have problems vapourizing any large mass instantaneously. A lot of smoke will be generated when it hits almost any target and that smoke will spread the laser in all directions reducing the power on target greatly. This is particularly a problem with any consideration of using lasers to shoot down ICBM re-entry vehicles, which not only smoke like nobody&#39;s business due to the heat shield, but continually rotate and move so fast that the beam diameter invariably will be huge.", "comment_date": "2018-10-07T15:51:53Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Durakk", "comment_text": "Can&#39;t help but cringe whenever a scientist uses the empirical system", "comment_date": "2018-10-07T15:23:32Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "okstateben", "comment_text": "So cool!", "comment_date": "2018-10-07T07:14:13Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Alfred Schembri", "comment_text": "Your shirt needs ironing.", "comment_date": "2018-10-07T04:34:35Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Maxim Trushin", "comment_text": "Earth is flat, and your rejection of God will haunt you after you die.", "comment_date": "2018-10-06T05:22:33Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "TheKantor", "comment_text": "Magnificent animation", "comment_date": "2018-10-06T05:03:43Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Alex Tigre", "comment_text": "What the hell is &quot;Space Time&quot;?", "comment_date": "2018-10-06T00:24:13Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Russel Ison", "comment_text": "It is money well spent \ud83d\ude03", "comment_date": "2018-10-05T22:33:57Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "pingoochnl", "comment_text": "Well from the point of view of someone who isn&#39;t &quot;stretched&quot;, yes he sees things getting stretched.<br>Here&#39;s a corellation: your twin brother goes to space, passes through extreme gravitational fields, and then comes back.

That formula (the Fitzgerald-Lorentz contraction), which hypothetically accounts for a shortening of the measuring apparatus that occurs due to &#39;earth&#39;s motion&#39;, was contrived as a possible explanation of why the result showed no detectable motion of earth. Since nobody at the time had a better explanation, it was adopted and is now commonly factored in to such experiments. I have a hard time believing that by using the same instrument which failed to detect earth&#39;s motion a over hundred years ago that it can now be used to detect gravitational waves billions of light years away. Why would they utilize the same device which failed to register the motion of the earth itself, on which it sets, to detect a much, much fainter motion billions of light years from earth? And if the results show no waves (movement) then we just correct for shortening of the device due to earth&#39;s motion?? So, the motion couldn&#39;t be detected... due to the motion itself? .....

From my rather limited understanding of Einsteinian relativity, &#39;gravity&#39; is a condition that exists within the structure of space/time due to the presents of mass wherein space/time is (for lack of better term) &#39;condensed&#39; or warped toward the center of that mass. Any other mass (itself forming a similar &#39;condensation&#39; depending on its&#39; mass) will attract one another (unidirectional polarity) in such a way as to seek out a point of least energy effort in an as straight a line as possible. Be that a &#39;line&#39; of direct attraction or falling into orbit around each other until such time as no further energy can or needs be expended. Seeking a point of &#39;rest&#39; so to speak. I was to the understanding that &#39;gravity&#39; is not so much a &#39;field&#39; or &#39;force&#39; of energy as simply being an effect cause within the structure of space/time itself that can only be effected by the presence of &#39;mass&#39; within it.<br><br>I understand that it takes energy to warp space/time but two bodies of mass in close proximity can only generate a warpage of space to total the combined mass of both. I also understand that something to the order of ripples or oscillations could be generated within the structure of space by the two orbiting bodies depending in part on their frequency of orbit. However, the magnitude of those oscillations would be more a local phenomenon not generally noted to propagate across the universe as gravity is described as being the &#39;weakest of forces&#39; the attractive strength of which falls off sharply square the distance from the mass? It can&#39;t exceed the effect of the total mass minus the energy used to effect that space/time in which it is embedded.<br><br> Now we say that we&#39;ve detected &#39;gravitational waves&#39; (keeping in mind that &#39;gravity&#39; is the weakest of all &#39;forces&#39; (?).). What are the implications here? What is it that we&#39;ve actually detected? Roughly speaking, I&#39;m to understand that an &#39;oscillation&#39; is caused by the release of energy from a source of higher concentration that propagates out and away from that source through a given medium to a condition of lower concentration at the expenditure of energy as a function of entropy.  <br><br>What is that &#39;energy&#39; that we&#39;ve detected? Is it simply the warpage of space/time itself or a separate energy which caused it (least likely)? If so, how/what? But should it actually turn out that &#39;gravity&#39; is a unique &#39;force&#39; in and of itself, wouldn&#39;t that be something of a deeper understanding other than simply warpage of space? If so, wouldn&#39;t that give rise to the question of what is its&#39; nature? Could it possibly carry characteristics that might be akin to electromagnetism? Even tho it&#39;s the weakest and unipolar, wouldn&#39;t that further sponsor the question of could this lead to a better understanding of how this &#39;gravitational force&#39; (?) might possibly work, how it&#39;s generated and/or can it be manipulated or controlled in some useful way as with other electromagnetic forces?<br><br>Perhaps what I&#39;m asking is what that &#39;energy&#39; is and is that &#39;energy&#39; what we claim to have detected or simply its&#39; effect on space/time from a distance? Because if it turns out to be a unique energy/force.......

I also provided the mechanical design for the return beam calibration fixture from the mirrors at the end of each of the two-and-a-half-mile long vacuum tubes that a laser beam is bounced off of some 400 times. That\u2019s the equivalent of a 1,000-mile distance between the source and its detector, and there are two legs that interference fringes are compared against.It\u2019s good to know the distinction between the terms \u201cgravity waves\u201d and \u201cgravitational waves.\u201d A body such as the earth causes what are referred to as gravity waves. It\u2019s the earth\u2019s gravity that causes physical perturbations in our environment. These are seen on the surface of water and atmospheric conditions that oscillate the air. In other words, these are visible waves caused by the gravitational attraction of our planet or any other celestial body. On the other hand, gravitational waves are ripples in spacetime.<br><br>The physicists at Caltech related to me that the purpose of LIGO was not merely to detect gravitational waves, but to determine whether they travel at some speed or whether gravity is an instantaneous phenomenon. They either propagate or exert an instant attraction through spacetime as they warp the fabric of space, slightly shrinking and expanding the space between objects. The distances are minuscule, but can be detected using LIGO. These detectable waves, or as I prefer to call them, contractions, are illustrated on the Internet with two large masses such as neutron stars or black holes as they begin to revolve around each other. This causes what would be equivalent to making waves in a still pool of water by rotating two basketballs round each other. These characteristics have been illustrated on the Internet as looking like waves that propagate outward in a spiral pattern. This may not be the case. The intent of LIGO was to provide evidence for the idea that gravitational waves might be instantaneous rather than having a speed such as the speed of light.<br><br>From websites I\u2019ve viewed, these only show one of the two possibilities in their graphics; this is the one that illustrates that gravitational waves propagate outward at some speed rather than being instantaneous. A spiral pattern would be present if gravitational waves do in fact propagate at some speed, such as the speed of light. However, if gravitational waves do not propagate, and they radiate outward instantaneously, LIGO would not be able to detect the difference. As mentioned, waves propagating at some speed are only what the Internet illustrations show using a spiral pattern. What I have never seen on any of the web pages I\u2019ve looked at concerning the discovery of gravitational waves by LIGO is what gravitational waves would look like if gravity were exerted instantaneously. Unfortunately, all the Internet illustrations show gravitational waves moving out from their origin in the illustrated spiral.<br><br>To discover whether gravitational waves propagate at the speed of light or if they are an instantaneous effect is actually not possible, but at least one possibility can be eliminated. To eliminate one of these possibilities, the optical telescopes on Earth need to look in the spot where the event took place at the same time as the gravitational waves are being detected by LIGO. If they witness some sort of visible light, like an explosion, then they will know that gravity propagates at the speed of light. In other words, the gravitational waves would arrive at the same time as a multitude of photons emitted from the collision. If the optical telescopes see nothing, then gravitational waves have moved into the possibility that gravity is instantaneous, but we would not be able to prove this for possibly millions of years. This is because the gravitational wave arrived here at the same time the event took place, while its light would not arrive until far into our future.<br><br>If gravitational waves were instantaneous, their shape would look very different from website illustrations. They would simply appear as a rotating ellipse, rotating along a horizontal or equatorial axis of the two revolving objects with its strength diminishing with distance.<br><br>To exemplify this further, picture that the gravitational field of any spherical object is also spherical. If two spheres come into proximity, their combined gravitational field produces an elliptical shape. Now if these two bodies are spinning around each other, they would produce a rotating elliptical gravitational field.

Back-propagating magnetic field and particle/plasma flux at these times through the magnetosphere is quasiperiodically-driven and coincides with  Earth-facing coronal holes, changes in sunspot number, increased TGF and particle emission from thunderstorms and magnetospheric plasma, and other strangely periodic space weather with vacuum-like properties and non-chaotic non-stationary intervals that result from an interplay of coherence and bifurcation. GOES and ACE record these  fluctuations, coinciding with superimposed/near-simultaneous globally-coherent CG lightning discharges with periodic global 5-minute and 10-minute gaps between max. count/t and ground magnetometer data. This thunderstorm driving from solar wind coupling to ionosphere is coincident with phase-locked quasiperiodic LIGO &quot;noise&quot; that exceeds desired signal in every case by more than 3 standard deviations. This noise is spectrally-identical to the unfiltered GW signals that  consisting of identical self-similar chirp-like components with quasiperiodic superposition. Major thunderstorms were active in the line-of-sight between the LIGO detector pair, displaying the aforementioned beaming-bursting behavior, during GW triggers. Their centroid and boundary source loci produce the same time lags for their particular acceleration rates, identical to remnant object spin rates as calculated by LIGO, as well as to known particle and signal transfer velocities at known distances from transient thunderstorm emission. <br><br>Several more unbiased analyses that I have performed utilizing LIGO strain, geophysical time series, and space physical/astronomical time series are available in truncated form prior to publication : <br><a href=\"https://fulguritics.blogspot.com/2018/06/\">https://fulguritics.blogspot.com/2018/06/</a><br><a href=\"https://fulguritics.blogspot.com/2018/06/continent-wide-blitzortung.html\">https://fulguritics.blogspot.com/2018/06/continent-wide-blitzortung.html</a><br><a href=\"https://fulguritics.blogspot.com/2018/06/httpswww.html\">https://fulguritics.blogspot.com/2018/06/httpswww.html</a><br><a href=\"https://fulguritics.blogspot.com/2018/06/srchttpswww.html\">https://fulguritics.blogspot.com/2018/06/srchttpswww.html</a><br><a href=\"https://fulguritics.blogspot.com/2018/06/blog-post.html\">https://fulguritics.blogspot.com/2018/06/blog-post.html</a><br><a href=\"https://fulguritics.blogspot.com/2018/06/roger-penrose-penrose-2017-may-be.html\">https://fulguritics.blogspot.com/2018/06/roger-penrose-penrose-2017-may-be.html</a>", "comment_date": "2018-07-24T02:58:19Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Brian Schmidt", "comment_text": "WOW!!!", "comment_date": "2018-07-24T00:19:01Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Mark Spieglan", "comment_text": "Astonishing!

However, if the earth&#39;s gravitational pull has no effect on the laser, then we can all agree and say that the sun&#39;s gravitational pull has no effect and if gravity has no effect on light (besides this stretching of space-time from black holes that LIGO claims they are measuring), then according to the laws of light and gravity, no matter whether the earth is stationary in space or moving at 100,000,000 mph, the light should head in a straight path unaltered by gravity.

It is incorrect and science just needs to accept this.  Why? First, if gravity is the distortion or space-time as proposed by modern theory, it would occur in a 3D plane. Think of a sphere sitting in the middle of a jello mold. The mass displaces the jello causing a geometric distortion inward and all around the sphere. Ok, good to go right? No. Now add a rotational velocity around its center. Then add a orbit around a larger object occupying the same jello mold. Granted any force portrayed would be experienced between a relative body m2 and a large body m1. But here is the problem. Once that sphere is in rotation around that primary mass what happens to the jello mold? Think of a bullet being shot into water. As it progresses through the medium it ripples out perpendicular to motion. A gap is created where the mass displacement occurs and then the water fills that gap, creating sympathetic ripples. The bullet progresses further, it &quot;breaks&quot; the water as it moves, causing an initial ripple head. <br>So why do we not see this as the Earth is moving through space? Why do we not see gravitational ripples occurring as we transit perpendicular to our motion? How come there is not reaction from space as the gravitational gap is filled as Earth moves out of a &quot;curved space&quot; coordinate? How come there is no action as Earth produces a new distortion when orbiting as it enters new space? <br>See, this is a huge discrepancy with relativity. Gravity in itself cannot violate Newtons 3rd law. So if a mass is moving through space, space is not moving with the mass. This is known because an objects motion is a relative plane. Which means that the gravitational field (curved space) is a process and as the Earth moves this process is repeated over and over. It distorts space, space fills the gap, the mass distorts new space. Even with a small gravitational field this would cause noticeable reactions. Oscillation patterns would be constant and detectable. Not only that, due to the mass of the gas giants and the sun, the transitory oscillation patterns that move perpendicular to them would of destroyed us a long time ago. Therefore, gravity is not a distortion of space=time. In Essence Spacetime is a myth and really doesnt exist. <br>So what is gravity and why do our mathematics work? Our measurement and observation of Gravity is not incorrect. Just the theory of how it is created as an effect. As we have tested it, and many others. Gravity is the product of a process. Think for a moment of how pendulums synchronize. The reason is that the pendulums have an equilibrium generated between them. Their masses are similar or they have lengths that are harmonic. This means that they will resonate within a local time reference frame in relation to the primary local time reference frame (Earth). This produces a large resonance between the pendulums and the Earth. Each atom in your body has a local time reference plane. Together, they form an organism which has an overall oscillation. This oscillation is in tune with the primary local time reference plane (Earth). In a sense it is similar to domains of a magnet. Although, this tuning of mass (matter) to local reference plains causes the atoms (dielectric mediums) to align with the primary body. Although subtle, the force is there and we call it gravity. So in essence we can call gravity a dielectric acceleration towards a point of centripetal convergence, which stops when the centrifugal divergence potential is reached. (The electromagnet forces interact in repulsion) The actual explanation is a little more complex.

Gravity is rippling on top of the empty space waves.The waves are the underlying empty space rippling. The gravity is not stretched, space is not stretched but does change shape depending on gravity strength,  New empty space is being created by gravity moving into empty and leaving another space behind. When gravity hits empty space it ripples in various ways,  This is more easy to spot at a black hole because gravity is so big we see that empty space has actually inverted or collapsed. For light we have GAMMA to long wave. For Gravity we have some other spectrum. Call it low to high gravity. Space ripples when hit by different gravity frequency spectrums in different ways. Light ripples when hit by gravity. We see this in double slit, I do anyway. It all goes back to pilot wave theory. Think of everything being Frequency. Waves are what we get when one frequency comes into contact with another frequency. Example could be light frequency hitting gravity frequency. Each frequency has a range/spectrum. Different combos of frequencies produce different results, different waves. Example we can see some frequency as color. A color could be viewed as the combination of all colors lower than it on the spectrum. Related to this video, this its not &quot;gravity waves&quot; - That makes us think that gravity is the wave, Gravity is just the thing that travels along an underlying wave. Its gravity interacting/rippling with space time waves, It is empty space that ripples on contact with gravity. Almost like pilot wave again. I think this repeats for many things in space science.

If space-time stretches then time stretches too right, not just the distance the light travels? Hiss answer, as I understand it, is that the gravity wave&#39;s effect is really slow so you shoot multiple photons all the way down and back in the time that it stretches the tube to its maximum length. Then there will be a difference in time from when the light has to travel the short (normal) distance and the long (stretched) distance. But I&#39;m thinking that if space-time is stretched than the effect would be on time and distance not just distance, so the light would take longer but since it is in a stretched chunk of space-time is also slower.... dang it, I confused myself.

The problem with this lab&#39;s solution is scale.  Two measuring facilities on opposing sides of a continent are mathematically about 1 billion light years too close together to be able to read any such fluctuation using the Newtonian model as Einstein first pointed out, and that&#39;s before even considering the hundred thousand natural occurrences that could cause such a small shift in light without the existence of gravitational waves required to explain the results.  (Or even gravity from within the Earth itself, which, given the Newtonian explanations of it&#39;s ambulatory molten core would be far more likely to be the cause then anything moving through massive distances of space, from outer space, according to Newton and Einstein&#39;s greatest followers.)  <br>      Interestingly; the findings and some of the most accurate animations (not included in this video) actually show effects already explained in detail by Nikolai Tesla regarding magnetic particle wave behavior.   This proves that either these scientists are not measuring &#39;gravity waves&#39; at all (contrary to the claims) OR as Edward Leedskalnin suggested, the other thing this could prove is that the entire Newtonian model of physics is simply wrong about the structure and function of objects in quantum mechanics.<br>       Any of these points should call these findings into question, and Tesla&#39;s explanations fit better and have lasted longer then any of the changing theories since.

Modern science currently recognizes four forces of nature: The strong nuclear force, the weak nuclear force, gravity, and electromagnetism.<br>2. In school we are taught that with magnetism, opposite polarities attract and like polarities repel. But inside the arc of a large horseshoe magnet it&#39;s the other way around, like polarities attract and opposite polarities repel. (I have proved this to myself with magnets and anybody with a large horseshoe magnet and two smaller bar magnets can easily prove this to yourself too).<br>3. Charged particles have an associated magnetic field with them.<br>4. Protons and electrons are charged particles and have their associated magnetic fields with them.<br>5. Photons also have both an electric and a magnetic component to them.<br><br>FOUR FORCES OF NATURE DOWN INTO TWO:<br>6. When an electron is in close proximity to the nucleus, it would basically generate a 360 degree spherical magnetic field.<br>7. Like charged protons would stick together inside of this magnetic field, while simultaneously repelling opposite charged electrons inside this magnetic field, while simultaneously attracting the opposite charged electrons across the inner portion of the electron&#39;s moving magnetic field.<br>8. There are probably no such thing as &quot;gluons&quot; in actual reality.<br>9. The strong nuclear force and the weak nuclear force are probably derivatives of the electro-magnetic field interactions between electrons and protons.<br>10. The nucleus is probably an electro-magnetic field boundary.<br>11. Quarks also supposedly have a charge to them and then would also most likely have electro-magnetic fields associated with them, possibly a different arrangement for each of the six different type of quarks.<br>12. The interactions between the quarks EM forces are how and why protons and neutrons formulate as well as how and why protons and neutrons stay inside of the nucleus and do not just pass through as neutrinos do.<br><br>THE GEM FORCE INTERACTIONS AND QUANTA:<br>13. Personally, I currently believe that the directional force in photons is &quot;gravity&quot;.<br>14. I also believe that a pulsating singularity (which is basically a pulsating photon) is the pure energy unit.<br>15. When these pulsating pure energy units interact with other pure energy units, they tangle together. Various shapes (strings, spheres, whatever) might be formed, which then create sub-atomic material, atoms, molecules, and everything in existence in this universe.<br>16. When the pure energy units unite together they would tend to stabilize and vibrate.<br>17. I believe there is probably a Photonic Theory Of The Atomic Structure.<br>18. Everything is basically &quot;light&quot; (photons) in a universe entirely filled with &quot;light&quot; (photons).<br><br>THE MAGNETIC FORCE SPECIFICALLY:<br>19. When the electron with it&#39;s associated magnetic field goes around the proton with it&#39;s associated magnetic field, internal and external energy oscillations are set up.<br>20. When more than one atom is involved, and these energy frequencies align, they add together, specifically the magnetic field frequency.<br>21. I currently believe that this is where a line of flux originates from, aligned magnetic field frequencies.<br><br>NOTES:<br>22. The Earth can be looked at as being a massive singular interacting photon with it&#39;s magnetic field, electrical surface field, and gravity, all three photonic forces all being 90 degrees from each other.<br>23. The flat spiral galaxy can be looked at as being a massive singular interacting photon with it&#39;s magnetic fields on each side of the plane of matter, the electrical field along the plane of matter, and gravity being directed towards the galactic center&#39;s black hole where the gravitational forces would meet, all three photonic forces all being 90 degrees from each other.<br>24. As below in the singularity, as above in the galaxy and probably universe as well.<br>25. I believe there are only two forces of nature, Gravity and EM, (GEM). Due to the stability of the GEM with the pure energy unit, this is also why the forces of nature haven&#39;t evolved by now. Of which with the current theory of understanding, how come the forces of nature haven&#39;t evolved by now since the original conditions acting upon the singularity aren&#39;t acting upon them like they originally were, billions of years have supposedly elapsed, in a universe that continues to expand and cool, with energy that could not be created nor destroyed would be getting less and less dense? My theory would seem to make more sense if in fact it is really true. I really wonder if it is in fact really true.<br>26. And the universe would be expanding due to these pulsating and interacting pure energy units and would also allow galaxies to collide, of which, how could galaxies ever collide if they are all speeding away from each other like is currently taught?<br><br>DISCLAIMER:<br>27. As I as well as all of humanity truly do not know what we do not know, the above certainly could be wrong. It would have to be proved or disproved to know for more certainty.", "comment_date": "2017-01-07T13:53:20Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "A R", "comment_text": "So now light can&#39;t escape a black hole And a black hole can&#39;t escape a black hole.", "comment_date": "2017-01-07T13:53:08Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Vincent Huneault", "comment_text": "2 Questions.

It gets the engineer / amateur astronomer in me excited.  Here is why, a quick throw away term you mentioned: Shot Noise!   A very important concept.  That is one of the noise sources of amplifying devices. Another one is thermal noise, which is the unavoidable noise every electronic component has that is proportional to its resistance, the frequency bandwidth of the circuit, and the absolute temperature of the component.  These noise sources combine statistically and make the design of sensitive electronics a challenge.  <br><br>I now have a question for you.  If they use one megawatt lasers as a signal source, how is that power dissipated in the receiver, the detector.  People have been using much less power than that to cut metal.  How can a sensitive detector survive being illuminated with that much power?  I get the principal of boosting the power to increase the signal to noise ratio, but yikes!
