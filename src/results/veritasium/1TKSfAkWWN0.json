There is never ever any flow of  positive charge carriers anywhere in any conductor as the way how your animative illustration shows, although such positive charge is simultanously transimitted from atom to atom while free electrons are moving in the opposite direction.  An object or a conductor becomes electrically dipole carrying an electric field only when there is a separation of two opposite charges, but not at all because the amount of positive or that of negative charge is larger. A larger amount of either positive or negative charge can make it become monopole and repel objects which carry the same charge, and attract objects of the oppostite charge. A bar of  Iron can become a magnet because iron molocules can become dipole, and thus possess an electric field and its emf which attracts metal&#39;s electrons to the surface of metal to create a bondage on the metal suface in contact with the magnet, and that is why you can illustrate how a iron magnet can attract any piece of metal of which electrons obviously always move to the surface of such pieces of conductors <br>Secondly, Einstein&#39;s special relativity  has been subjectively understood as there is a difference in time dialation between an object in a visible motion and  another object in invisiable motion or staying put on the Earth&#39;s surface. In both cases the object is actually always in a motion, but not that when it stands still or stays put at a location or a point on the Earth&#39;s surface, it is motionless or static or at rest as the way how you have fundamentally superficially understood it because the Earth is always in an endless rotational motion about its axis and along the repeated path around the Sun, and every single form of matter on it is also always in the same motion which is invisible to your shallow concept of motion, while you can always observe that you are always in the same rotational motion through the progress of sunlight or darkness on the Earth&#39;s face, such as a shade of a bulding or that of a large tree under sunlight or moon-light. <br>The idea that there is a difference of time dialation between a moving object and another object not visibly moving at all, such as a person flying in an airplane and another one staying stil on the Earth&#39;s surface is merely a wild imagination because human-invented concept of time here is merely a symbolic  value or unreal value orginated in the Earth&#39;s endless and repeated rotational motion about its axis and the Sun,  and actually is the distance in space which the Earth has travelled about its axis and along its orbital path around the Sun,  and the effects of sunlight and darkness on the Earth&#39;s surface. The distances the Earth travels and the effects of Sunlight and darkness on the Earth surface are real values. They are presented by human-invented concept of time and human-n invented concepts of mathematics, such as the numerical quantities 24 in 24 hours, 60 in 60 senconds, 1 in one minute, 2 in twoweeks , 6 in six moths  and  10 in a  period of ten years . Without such scalar quantities those symbolic names , hour, sencond, minute, week, month and year would be useless or meaningless because they are all purely symbolic or unreal values, while the true values are the distances in space which the Earth has travelled, and those symbolic names accompanied by those numerical quantities only function as indications of how long in distance of space the Earth has travelled along its repeated path about its axis and the Sun, and such indications of the changes of the Earth&#39;s position have been used as human standard  foundation for human limited knowledge to inteprete, to  evaluate and to mark the changes of physical structures and positions of all the observed which human beings can observe and interpret in a certain way, while the distances which  the Eath has travelled has nothing to do with the speed of motion nor the state of staying still of anything on the Earth&#39;s surface. The Earth&#39;s angular speed or velocity would never ever change at all whether you are flying along with its rotational motion or you are  staying put on its surface, and human concept of time is totally based on the Earth&#39;s natural and endless rotational motion, but not,  in any way, on whether you are moving or you are not at at all on its surface. Ex, if there were any actual difference in time dialation, people live in different parts of the planet would have different aging time process even when having been born at the same time, on the same day, moth and year, and those who are  located in the regions which are always ahead in terms of time would age faster and live for shorter periods of time  than those who live in regions which are always behind in terms of time zones<br>Now correctly understanding of human-invented concept of time is extremely vitally important for human constructive developments because such disatrous misunderstandings can still confine human beings in ignorance founded on such human subjective blind beliefs for many centuries to come<br>Even when you could fly faster than the Earth&#39;s rotational motion&#39;s speed, you would never ever fly faster than time to the future as the way how some ignorant individuals have claimed about how quantum mechenics could make it possible for human beings to travel backward to the paat and ahead to the future before the Earth itself or time can . When you flying from one location to another location on the Earth surface, since there are different time zones on the Earth&#39;s surface, it depends on which direction you are moving in whether you are ahead in time or have a faster running clock. EXample, if you are moving in the same direction as the diection of the Earth&#39;s rotational motion , you will get to a point ahead in time  or your time will be faster simply because you are moving from a later time zone to an earlier time zone according to the fact of which regions  can see sunlight before which other regions in the world can. if you are moving in the opposite direction of the Earth&#39;s motion, then you are moving from the earlier time zones to latter ones, and  thus your time will be slower                                                                                                                                                                                                  <br>Again, human concept of time depends solely on the Earth&#39;s rotational speed, and nothing else", "comment_date": "2022-05-26T10:13:43Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Marius", "comment_text": "<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1TKSfAkWWN0&amp;t=1m48s\">1:48</a> why is the wire still neutral? shouldn&#39;t the electrons contract", "comment_date": "2022-05-23T21:53:23Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Kiran Estake", "comment_text": "Hey, great video.

(To determine the direction of the magnetic field created from a flowing current, your curling fingers tell you which way.)<br><br>But does that mean the Special Relativity thing doesn&#39;t work?  I don&#39;t know.  As far as I can grok.., it should still work, if current in motion would in theory experience a &#39;shrinking&#39; effect, then yes, it should.  Electrons have mass, right?  And they <b>do</b> move, so...  Everything still obeys the rules proposed by this theory.<br><br>Except.., we&#39;ve got one professor Jefimenko, Oleg D. telling us that it&#39;s <b>not</b> possible at all with his paper: <b>&quot;Is magnetic field due to an electric current a relativistic effect?&#39;&quot;</b> (There are free copies on-line.  A 10 minute read, 3 pages. Heavy math, but with somewhat layperson-accessible notes).  He says the idea that Special Relativity theory causing magnetism is bunk.<br><br>I&#39;ve gone through that, but honestly, I don&#39;t get what he&#39;s claiming. I&#39;ll have to read it again, but it seems like while his math is likely spot-on, he&#39;s using higher level &quot;mot &amp; bailey&quot; logic to miss the point and discount the idea.  But again.., I don&#39;t quite understand his basic claim.<br><br>So all in all...<br><br>I understand the question a little more, find the Special Relativity idea elegant and compelling from a brochure level view, but I&#39;m still rather uncertain.  There&#39;s a lot of higher level stuff and very smart sounding people who don&#39;t sound convinced and who are not very good at explaining things in a way I can understand.", "comment_date": "2022-05-15T15:27:03Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "RootedHat", "comment_text": "Reminder that electrons and ions travel along the copper wire and not inside!", "comment_date": "2022-05-14T13:13:57Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Jin Kee", "comment_text": "The electron drift speed is quite slow isn&#39;t it?", "comment_date": "2022-05-13T08:15:21Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "raymond shikuku", "comment_text": "I see what you did with the cations aka kitty\ud83d\ude02", "comment_date": "2022-05-12T13:54:27Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Padmaja Ray", "comment_text": "Follow griffith 12no.chapter for more confirmation.", "comment_date": "2022-05-09T18:22:29Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Mahir__25", "comment_text": "why don&#39;t electrons in your video are contracted?", "comment_date": "2022-05-07T01:11:08Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "JAIS STEUER", "comment_text": "i recognized this voice from that 1 video about lightning", "comment_date": "2022-05-06T04:20:24Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "meow", "comment_text": "Finally got my senior high school physics covered", "comment_date": "2022-05-05T16:34:11Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Galaxy bidhan", "comment_text": "Sent some pdf about physics dude", "comment_date": "2022-05-04T13:57:48Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Kumod Singh", "comment_text": "Sir iam a class 10th student and i learned it will easily. <br>Actually physics is very cool.", "comment_date": "2022-05-02T15:21:00Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Sumeet Lubal", "comment_text": "I thought the electrons don\u2019t move actually but its the energy waves", "comment_date": "2022-05-01T20:13:39Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Marco Pilati", "comment_text": "sorry, sorry, sorry ... why on earth does the positive charge compact when we travel at the speed of electrons, being the charge of the copper wire unbalanced, while, instead, the electrons do not compact themselves in our &quot;static&quot; frame when we are still? <br>You said that when the electrons are in motion the copper wire remains electrically neutral,  am I wrong?<br>Isn&#39;t that a symmetry violation??", "comment_date": "2022-05-01T19:19:12Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Nicolaj Mikkelsen", "comment_text": "Its kinda funny going back and watching his old videos and seeing him slowly getting older and get more grey hair (Stil looking sharp tho, V) ;P", "comment_date": "2022-04-30T20:37:20Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Master James", "comment_text": "<b>Epic</b>", "comment_date": "2022-04-26T04:14:41Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "zakir hussain", "comment_text": "All forces and motions are produced by relative Space density.

The electrons and ions do not &quot;bunch up&quot; due to effects of Special Relativity; they are nothing like a fluid shrinking when temperature is reduced. Each particle shrinks <b>individually,</b> if at all, and moves at the same speed as if it was the only moving charge. Therefore, the rationale of the entire argument falls apart. Proofs of this may be easily seen. \r<br>For instance, think of a cable with 100 conductive strands, all bare wires in good contact with each other. Then cut away all but 1 strand of wire from part of the cable. Put a small current through the whole cable/wire. In the thick part of the cable, the electrons have to be moving only 1% as fast as they move in the single strand, yet the magnetic field measured in each case will be the the same when measured from a distance.\r<br>Another proof can be seen with an electron beam, in which the electrons move at a substantial fraction of the speed of light. Current carried by that beam produces a magentic field of exactly the same strength as the magnetic field generated by the wire carrying that current to the electron beam, even though the electron speed in the wire is a miniscule fraction of c. \r<br>A further proof can be had from conduction through an ionic fluid such as cesium iodide salt water. There the current is carried entirely by ions, with none carried by free electrons, and the ions are vastly more massive than lone electrons. There can be only the tiniest difference in speeds of the moving charges. Any effect due to Special Relativity will be <i>extremely small and essentially equal for charges of both signs.</i> How then will the video&#39;s example work to produce a differential effect?

During this time we see minima happening regularly at their 2.867321 day intervals. However, during August, the Earth is rapidly moving towards Algol at about 107,229 km/hr as explained on my How Fast Are We Moving? page. (The Earth moves approximately 202 times its own size in one day.) So in 2.867321 days the Earth moves about 7,379,039 km closer to Algol. But the varying light from Algol doesn&#39;t know this - its light waves left Algol 93 years ago and are travelling at a constant speed. The result - we &quot;catch a bunch of minima early&quot; during August as shown on Chart 2. Exactly the opposite happens during February - the Earth is moving away from Algol that fast and it takes longer for the group of minima to reach us so we see them taking longer between events. How long? 7,379,039 km divided by the speed of light 299,792.458 km/sec is 24.61382 seconds - this rough calculation explains the deviations we see in Graph 2. So in May and November when we are not moving towards or away from Algol - the period seems constant. It is our rapid movement towards or away from the events in August and February that causes the timing differences.&quot;<br><br>In February, when the earth is moving away from Algol there is an increase in time between eclipses and the light is passing the earth at a slower speed.

Whittaker:\r<br>\u201cOn the unitary hypothesis, that the current consists in a transport of one kind of electricity with a definite velocity relative to the wire, it might be expected that a coil rotated rapidly about its own axis would generate a magnetic field different from that produced by the same coil at rest. Experiments to determine the matter were performed by A. F\u00f6ppl and by E. L. Nichols and W. S. Franklin, but with negative results.\u201d [in 1889.]\r<br>Anyone with a compass and a piece of copper wire can do the experiment. From Wikipedia: \u201cTypically, electric charges in solids flow slowly. For example, in a copper wire of cross-section 0.5 mm2, carrying a  current of 5 A, the drift velocity of the electrons is on the order of a millimetre per second.\u201d To experiment one must make a handheld, circular loop of said copper wire and rotate it near the compass about its axis at tangential velocity say 100 mm/s, which is easily achievable. This should have the effect of a 500 A current on the compass.<br>\r<br><br>The real cause of magnetic field is as follows. Electrons are small magnets with their own tiny magnetic fields. The orientation of this field is denoted by the spin vector. When the ends of a wire are connected to a battery, free electrons are forced into a collective motion. Randomness of spin orientations disappears, and a macroscopic magnetic field forms around the wire as the sum of the individual electron fields.\r<br>This effect is known by the name &quot;current-induced spin accumulation&quot;, or Spin Hall Effect, but its simple fundamental meaning is not understood.\r<br>In magnetic materials the electron spins are permanently coherently oriented, there is no need to use electric current to force the spin orientation.\r<br>\r<br>Dr. Muller, you have said that \u201cWhen mistakes happen, I do my darnedest to correct them. And, of course, I will often consult with experts before I make a video.\u201d The mistake in question is not yours but the \u201cexperts\u2019\u201d.\r<br>One of them was Albert Einstein. In the article On the Electrodynamics of Moving Bodies Einstein introduced his relativistic electrodynamics. He wrote Maxwell\u2019s curl equations in the form in which the current density J is replaced by the product \u03c1v, charge density times velocity, thereby setting the science of electromagnetism on the course of increasing confusion!<br>\r<br>\r<br><br>This mistake has polluted the whole field of physical sciences. The experiment with a compass and a loop of copper wire renders flawed e.g. the following: Maxwell-Lorentz electrodynamics,  Magnetohydrodynamics, theory of Tokamak reactors (\u201cBennet pinch\u201d), a lot of Astrophysics (magnetic reconnection, dynamo theory, plasma ropes, plasma sheets)\u2026\r<br>\r<br><br>Dr. George Galeczki has written on this topic. In his article Beyond Maxwell-Lorentz Electro-dynamics he strongly states that \u201cME and LF do not form a coherent Maxwell-Lorentz theory as claimed in present day textbooks and monographies!\r<br>After the passing of Dr. Galeczki, it seems that I am the only person on the planet concerned about this mistake. I cannot understand how such an easily detectable flaw can persist in the foundations of modern physics.\r<br>I would very much like to see a video in which you do the experiment under the noses of experts, tell them what modern physics predicts to happen (500 A!), and ask what they think of the result.\r<br>\r<br>Best regards<br><br>Jouko A. Rautio\r<br>Researchgate\r<br>\r<br><br>P.S.  There is another little known fact: \r<br>The Michelson-Morley experiment is viewed as the primary experimental support for special relativity. Quantum Electrodynamics, or QED, is widely recognized as the \u201cJewel of Physics\u201d and the most accurate and successful theory in physics today.\r<br>If an analysis of the Michelson interferometer is carried out using the principles on which QED is based, it can be shown by a direct calculation that the Michelson interferometer is insensitive to its velocity in space.\r<br>This analysis is peer reviewed (by a Doctor of Mathematical Physics with thesis on STR) and published with the title &quot;QED-based Analysis of the Michelson-Morley Experiment.&quot; There is no mistake.

Now I assume a copper wire and proceed to making only a rough calculation with orders of magnitude, which will surfice for my purpose. 1 kg of copper has about 10^24 atoms, and each atom has 11 valence electrons (which are the free electrons in a copper wire), so there are about 10^25 free electrons per kg copper. So if the magnetism is caused by special relativity, there would only be about the charge of 1 electron difference per 1 kg of copper wire. The charge of 1 electron is about 10^(-19) coloumbs, which would not be enough to observe the strong forces that you get, if you e.g. use a coil with 1 kg of copper wire.

Let me consider a wire or a conductor, with a positively charged particle, called kitty, placed near to it. The conductor and the kitty are both at rest with me as an observer. In the wire or conductor, when there is no applied voltage.. the kitty observes that overall movemement of positive charges and electrons in the conductor  is zero. Kitty also observes that the density of negatively charged electron is equal to the density of positively charged nuclei. So, kitty doesn&#39;t feel any force when no voltage Is applied to conductor. I observe the same as well, no force on the kitty. Now when voltage is applied, kitty observes that Electrons are flowing, say with velocity v, while positively charged nuclei remain stationary more or less. That means kitty will observe that the space of separation between electron is less as compared to positive charges and thus density of electron is higher in the conductor. In simple word, kitty will be observing the conductor as negatively charged body no matter what direction the voltage is applied. And thus kitty will feel itself being attracted to  the conductor. I shall also observe the conductor as negatively charged, and kitty being attracted to the conductor. But through experiment, I can observe that this is not the case. The only way to have the expected outcome and real outcome overlap, is to consider that when voltage is applied, equal amounts of negatively charged particles and positively charged particles move. That is if negative charges flow with velocity v, then positive charges should be flowing with velocity -v. Instead of having n no electrons flowing, we have to have n/2 electrons flowing in one direction, and n/2 positively charged particles flowing in opposite direction. Now, this means flow of charges in a conductor always have to be in pairs, for the observer who is at rest with the conductor. Please explain this bizarre result arising from application of special relativity in the same way, as applied in the video.

According to the assertion, the cat at rest at <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1TKSfAkWWN0&amp;t=1m27s\">1:27</a> should observe a denser e- field when a current of electrons moves quickly relative to it, and in that case,  the cat at rest would be repelled by the contracted, more dense, field of electrons. But that is not what we observe in reality. The stationary charged cat only experiences a very small capacitive force due to the voltage applied to the wire. This voltage in effect stretches the e- field in the wire relative to the p+ field, making it less dense, and the positively charged cat would therefore be repelled slightly. However, the video is claiming that relativistic effects of particles moving at high velocities cause their field density to increase, which would have the effect of the positively charged cat to be attracted to the more dense e- field. That is not really what we observe. There may however be some combination of these two effects that are occurring, both an expansion of the e- field due to the voltage, and a compression due to high velocity that may be important to consider. But, I suspect that generally speaking, our empirical flux calculations of electron flow do not differentiate these effects. I also suspect that the capacitive effect is much more significant than the relativistic effect, based on  the relatively slow velocity of these electrons (as stated at: <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1TKSfAkWWN0&amp;t=3m19s\">3:19</a>). <br>All of that is totally independent of what occurs due to the movement of a charged particle through a magnetic field that has been created as a result of a current of charged particles flowing through the wire.

Suppose we conceive of the electron vibrating in the electromagnetic field such that any two electrons will vibrate at the same frequency and in the same phase such that the peaks and troughs of their vibrations meet and amplify, and the field in turn acts on the electrons to move them away from these amplified peaks, which appears as a repulsive force. If however particles have an opposite charge, we can conceive of them having opposing phases of vibration such that the peaks and troughs interfere destructively, leading to a relatively calm space in the field as opposed to the vibrations in all other directions, which push these particles together, and appear as an attractive force. Theoretically we can even ignore the frequency itself of the vibration so long as it is the same for particles in the same frame of reference. For different reference frames, the relative motion of the particles causes additional interference that keeps them separated, such that an orbiting electron can never move close enough to a proton to be captured. accelerating reference frames produce even more interference.", "comment_date": "2020-11-12T05:24:02Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Sanu Hindustani", "comment_text": "Can copper or other metals with current passing through them really get attracted towards magnets?", "comment_date": "2020-11-10T21:08:31Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "cchanc3", "comment_text": "and in his spare time, he&#39;s the quarterback of the browns", "comment_date": "2020-11-10T19:45:42Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Steffen Dammann", "comment_text": "<a href=\"https://youtu.be/28eLjs29HEU\">https://youtu.be/28eLjs29HEU</a>", "comment_date": "2020-11-10T16:38:21Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Raul Cantu", "comment_text": "WTF OMG", "comment_date": "2020-11-10T16:16:07Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Daniel", "comment_text": "Special relativity as a theoretical basis for magnetism is fundamentally flawed.

If you explain this just in the basis of length contraction then a stationary negative charge should feel a force from a conducting wire. But, guess what, it doesn&#39;t. Why? Well this is for you to figure out. I won&#39;t give you a lesson here (you can look at Bell&#39;s spaceship paradox if you like as a starting point). In the mean time (EDIT - the lesson is given below), you should remove this video if you are interested in education because it is incorrect. Length contraction alone cannot explain magnetism - try looking at non-simultaneity too. <br>You have fallen into a trap of regurgitating general information that is actually false.<br><br>EDIT: The reason why a stationary (say electron) at some distance from a conducting wire will not be repelled from the wire if it is carrying an electrical current in which the charge carriers are electrons is a follows:<br>The stationary electron does indeed view the moving electrons (or better, the distance between them) to be length contracted so overall the density of electrons on the wire from the standpoint of the stationary electron will be greater than the density of positive ions that are not moving relative to the lone electron outside the wire. The wire then is perceived as overall negatively charged. But why no repulsion? This is because of Coulombs Law. It turns out that Coulombs law only strictly applies to charges that are stationary with respect to each other. If they are moving with respect to each other, you need to use a modified version. You can appreciate this by imagining that the electrical field that reaches each electron represents the position of the other electron in the past (just like the light from distant stars). This means that the force must not be representative of the &#39;instantaneous&#39; distance, but some distance in the past. You might say that if you consider the symmetry of the situation as the electron passes the other that the effect would cancel out because some distances will have a positive correction and some will have a negative correction.  But it does not the case here due to the inverse square relationship of force between individual charges (if someone is running backwards and forwards betwwen you to a distance 10m away, their average distance is 5m, but the average &quot;squared distance&quot; is further away). In any case the lone electron feels less repulsive force from the moving electrons that it does attractive force from the stationary positive ions which is EXACTLY cancelled out by the increased charge density of the electrons due to length contraction. Hence no overall attraction or repulsion.<br><br>Thus only when the lone electron is moving relative to the wire AND electrons are moving IN the wire things start getting interesting (i.e. what we call magnetism). <br><br>I cannot take ANY credit for this explanation: people much much smarter than me figured it out long long ago.

So when theres current in the wire and the electrons are moving, the size of the electron itself contracts- but it doesnt matter , the spacing between the electrons is the same so there is no net negative charge density. Thus no net force. <br><br>Now lets look the same experiment in the electron&#39;s reference frame. The electron is now stationary and the positive ions in the wire are moving. The cat is also moving, in the same direction of the positive ions. Since the nuclei are connected to each other via chemical bonds within the space between them, not only do the positive ions length contract but those chemical bond&#39;s length contract. Due to this the spacing between the positive ions is smaller, and now there is an excess positive charge density. This means there&#39;s a positive electric force repelling the cat. <br><br>But also consider the cat is now moving near a wire with positive current in it, and the cat is moving in the same direction of the positive current.

Well it&#39;s been seven years. I&#39;ve watched this video dozens of times, and I&#39;ve finally figured it out.                                                          Imagine an entire electric circuit. I.e. a battery (or capacitor, or whatever), with a loop of wire going from one terminal to the other. The total number of electrons in the circuit is constant (because due to relativity, charge must remain constant). If we start with the battery disconnected, everything is fine. The electron density matches the proton density, and the wire has no net charge.  When we connect the battery, electrons start to flow. Let&#39;s imagine that they <b>do</b> contract in our reference frame. The total number of electrons must stay the same within our circuit, so where did the extra electrons come from? The answer is that when the electrons contract, the negative charge increase causes the electrons to repel each other back to a neutral net charge state. The result is that the electrons themselves get smaller, but they move father away from each other (back to a no current spacing) such that the net charge in the wire is still neutral. This also means that the total number of electrons in our circuit, and the electron density <b>does not</b> change. And thus, the wire has no net charge whether current is flowing or not (within our reference frame).  Now from the moving reference frame of the cat, with no current flowing in the circuit, the electrons as well as the wire and battery contract equally, maintaining zero net charge. But when current is flowing, there will be a point in the circuit where electrons are flowing the same direction as the observer, and a point in the circuit where the electrons are flowing opposite the observer. Where they are moving in the same direction, they expand, reducing in density, and creating a net positive charge. But where they move in the opposite direction, they contract, creating a net negative charge. All that has happened is the density of electrons within the circuit has been redistributed. However the total number of electrons within the circuit still remains the same. The force that the charged cat experiences is the difference between the positively charged portion of the circuit, and the negatively charged portion. If the positively charged portion is (physically) much closer to the cat, a net repulsion force is experienced.", "comment_date": "2020-07-05T13:57:26Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Zubair Khan", "comment_text": "So two magnets divided by a barrier dil produce a magnetic effect because of their frame of reference being the same?", "comment_date": "2020-07-05T01:24:14Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Stefan Ionescu", "comment_text": "There is either the answer mixing it i don&#39;t get it.

I MUST SAY THAT WAS A VERY INTERESTING THEORY YOU PRESENTED IN THIS VIDEO. to bad you are polluting the minds of any young student that might be interested in physics in the future. what u r doing, is corrupting the minds of youngsters, and adults as well, by using the sheer &quot;QUANTUM&quot; force of opening your mouth, so they can watch garbage fall out of it.  Do you have a physics degree? If you do, its too bad u wasted all that money. SEE HERE&#39;S THE DEAL EINSTEIN .... You are so far out in left &quot;FIELD&quot; with your regurgitated theory that i almost choked on a piece of steak,  when i watched your video. Your Baseline is wrong, your premise is completely false, your egg just laid the chicken...(how is that not a famous quote?) OK..lets start from the first grade, when everything they taught you about a magnet, was false...(if you ever played with them as a kid and thought for yourself, and used some reasoning, you would know what they taught was false.) Now lets move to chemistry and physics in high school, when you were introduced to THE ELECTRON, THE PHOTON, AND SOME CRAZY THEORY CALLED QUANTUM MECHANICS AND E=RETARD SQUARED. NOW SEE IF YOU WOULD HAVE LISTENED REALLY WELL AND TOOK NOTES THE FIRST TIME YOU HEARD THE WORD ELECTRON, (from the presentation you just gave, it sounds like you may have been to busy smoking crack, crystal meth , or ate a bag of mushrooms) you would , at some point heard your science teacher say something to the effect of this, .... &quot;Well technically, we have never been able to observe, weigh, or even catch a glimpse of an electron, even under a microscope, because when we go tom observe it, its not there, it actually disappears under observation&quot;  AM I RINGING A BELL HERE? I BET I AM... when you heard that, bells should have went off in your head and smoke should have started coming out of your ears. but obviously it did not. SEE the electron has NEVER been the result of any experiment... EVER.... see there were these guys named  George Johnstone Stoney, (he named this &quot;charge &quot; &#39;electron&#39; in 1891, and J. J. Thomson and his team of British physicists identified it as a particle in 1897.) HE WAS ACTUALLY PAID AND BRIBED TO STATE THE EXISTENCE OF AN ELECTRON AS A PARTICLE AND WAS GIVEN THE NOBEL PRIZE, EVEN THOUGH HE KNEW IT DID NOT AND COULD NOT EVER EXIST AS A PARTICLE. NIKOLA TESLA AND STIENMETZ ALMOST HAD STROKES BECAUSE THEY ALSO KNEW IT COULD NEVER BE A PARTICLE NOR COULD IT EVER EXIST IN A QUANTIFICATION SENSE. EINSTEIN ALSO KNEW THIS, BUT DECIDED TO QUANTIFY IT AND ASSIGN IT MASS, BECAUSE HE COULDNT GET HIS EQUATIONS TO WORK... in doing so, he changed and ruined physics from that point until today and its still going. SO IF YOUR PREMISE IS BASED ON A THEORY THAT IS FALSE, HOW ARE YOUR CONCLUSIONS CORRECT&quot;? IF YOU FOR ONE SECOND , THINK THAT THERE ARE CHARGED PARTICLES RUNNING INSIDE THE WIRES, ON THE TELEPHONE POLES THAT RUN DOWN YOUR STREET, then i feel sorry for you.... there is nothing inside the wires, the &#39;POWER&quot; (IM NOT USING THE CORRECT WORD HERE BECAUSE IM GOING TO LEAVE THIS UP TO YOU TO FIGURE OUT\u00ba) is in between the wires (INSIDE THE @#!^%&amp;^&amp;^@ field, see if you can figure out tHE WORD THAT COMES BEFORE FIELD)<br>I MEAN?

Electrons as a particle is a theory, not a fact. We have never observed an actual electron. Instead, we have observed a small area that reacted in a way that was net negatively charged to the applied force and called that phenomenon an electron. That&#39;s, not the problem. The problem is we now think that electrons are particles and while its a valid theory it is taught as if it was a proven fact which it is not. The second problem is that we gave the electron the attribute of being a purely negative charge, not a negative charge relative to something else but actually negative. There is no and can be no such thing as a purely negative charge. With batteries, we are looking a net positive side and a net negative side and as soon as one is not negative or positive relative to the other side your battery is dead. In AC, positive and negative are only references to the direction the current is traveling other than that they are identical.  But what about static charges? Well, we will tell you in the example of static electricity that it is electron particles jumping from one set of atoms to another, and while this is an amazing theory derived from multiple theories it is just that a theory NOT A PROVEN FACT nor is it based on PROVEN FACTS! What if our observations are correct but our conclusions are wrong or even worse what if our conclusions wile wrong are so close to the truth that we don&#39;t see our error and start to treat are an error as a fact. What would happen? Would we end up going from that single mistake of thinking an electron is a particle with a purely negative charge and build theory after theory on top of it until we get to a point that our physics breaks and we have to invent new rules for things because nothing seems to unify anymore? Sounds a lot like the current state of our scientific understanding of the universe. So is it more likely that Newtonian physics just happens to break when we get to particles because the small is just so different we need a new set of rules or did we simply make an error in our conclusion and build on that error until it fell apart?", "comment_date": "2019-09-02T18:36:27Z", "likes_count": 2}, {"comment_by": "Oak Tree", "comment_text": "Subject proposal for a sequel video: how strong nuclear force keeps planets in their orbits", "comment_date": "2019-08-30T17:43:42Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Yours Truely", "comment_text": "The drifting of electrons of 80 cm per hour is something else than the speed of elecricity in a wire or in a vacuum.

This is reasonable because it&#39;s actually what is observed in real life, on a wire with current flowing through it. Put in relativistic terms, from the stationary cat/protons rest frame, the observed distance between the (moving) electrons is the same as the observed distance between the protons, therefore net zero charge density and no electric field. Note that under this assumption, the explanation that a moving cat will be repelled by the wire still holds: when changing to the reference frame of the moving cat, distance between electrons will increase (they are now slower in this frame, therefore less length contraction) and distance between protons will decrease, resulting in an electric field with a net positive charge.<br><br>If you still want to think about the length contraction of the moving electrons from the stationary cat/protons rest frame, realise that &quot;length contraction&quot; is a concept referring to the difference in observed length of something (or just space itself) being measured from two different frames.

General and special relativity are nonsense physics, just as quantum mechanics is absolute nonsense.  Only those lacking in critical thinking skills would believe such garbage science.  You are being sold a religion, not science.\r<br>\r<br>Magnetism is an invisible force; we can feel its attractive or repulsive force, we can measure it, and we can generate it, but scientists don\u2019t actually know what causes its action at a distance.  In a pure vacuum, two separated bar magnets will still attract or repel one-another, so there is a force between them that is not based on electromagnetic energy, particles, or any other known cause.  The underlaying causational force of magnetism is a complete mystery to present science.  \r<br>\r<br>Let\u2019s also consider the phenomena of gravity.  Scientists say gravity is caused by curved spacetime (general relativity,) which allegedly warps space around a mass into a gravity well, creating the effects of gravity.  The problem is that there is no tangible foundation to base relativity (curved spacetime) upon, it is solely built upon theoretical equations used as a simulation of facts.  Science doesn\u2019t know what space is made of.  Space has three spatial dimensions, which are physical properties, and physical properties cannot just magically exist, they must have a physical causation to exist.  Scientists don\u2019t know what space is made of, and since space makes up the vast majority of the universe, scientists are missing the biggest part of the picture.  Scientists don\u2019t know what physically causes gravity.\r<br>\r<br>In the case of special relativity, stating that length and time are not absolute is a complete delusional notion.  First of all, time is an invented measurement of duration, not an intrinsic property of space.  A ball will roll down a hill due to gravity, time has no part in its action, time is not a force, it is an arbitrary measurement of how long it took to roll down the hill.  It does not matter if three people at three different distances watch it roll down the hill, each person being at a different distance will view the ball rolling at different times because the speed of light will take longer to reach them if they are further away than another person.  As well, length does not contract the higher an object\u2019s velocity becomes.  The Lorentz contraction is a theoretical equation that has no bases in fact; it is only a hypothetical notion that cannot be physically tested.  In other words, it is just Alice-in-Wonderland science.\r<br>\r<br>If you believe in these invented scientific notions of relativity and quantum mechanics, you lack critical thinking skills.  The institutions of physics and cosmology are badly infiltrated with nonsense physics.

Based on his assessment of recently discovered properties of electromagnets, he expected that when current started to flow in one wire, a sort of wave would travel through the ring and cause some electrical effect on the opposite side. He plugged one wire into a galvanometer, and watched it as he connected the other wire to a battery. Indeed, he saw a transient current (which he called a &quot;wave of electricity&quot;) when he connected the wire to the battery, and another when he disconnected it.[8]:182\u2013183 This induction was due to the change in magnetic flux that occurred when the battery was connected and disconnected. Wiki \r<br>\r<br>There is no magnetic flux. When current flow in one wire, induced emf in the core make atoms in the core arrange into magtons as -1+1, -1+1, -1+1 direction all the way through, this emf induce a temporary current in other wire. When the battery disconnected, lose of emf in the core cause the magtons to return to atoms, this electrons movement in the core induce an opposite temporary current again in the other wire.\r<br>\r<br>There is no electromagnetic wave, only electric wave/electrostatic wave.

So if you run a current through the wire, the negative charges move at the same speed as the positive charges (which is really just an absence of a negative one). So you have one stream of moving charges, not two like in the video illustration, and they move in opposite direction at the same speed. So when you move the cat against the flow of electrons, the space between them (which is what we call a positive charge) contracts, making it negatively charged. But when you move the cat with the flow of electrons, the electrons stop moving from its frame of reference (when they were moving at the speed of light before),  spreading the charges out from each other. Because that space is the actual positive charge, it becomes positively charged and the cat is repelled. So am I right? Cat is attracted moving one way and repelled the other? How was my explanation?

Faraday was highly dubious regarding Newtons conclusions about force. The fact is that the \u201cmissing three-fourths of the force\u201d is not lost whatsoever, the loss of mutual acceleration is in counterspace and mediated between both dielectricity and magnetism, both impelled by and \u2018lost\u2019 therein; this is a natural attribute to dielectricity, either as found in the so-\rcalled \u201cmagnet\u201d or in its aggregated form as found in mass/matter. Newton\u2019s equation is not about force, or as argued by others, tension, rather dielectric voidance. In which case we have the equation of Newton corrected: D.V. = M1 x M2/ Distance^2. All acceleration of bodies via gravity or \u201cmagnets\u201d are undergoing dielectric voidance, or magnetic (so-called) induction and resultant acceleration is the simplex process of dielectric voidance. The presumed increasing or decreasing \u2018force\u2019 is merely a field attribute necessitated by which spatial voidance is enacted to mediate the dielectric field voidances which eliminate space in their accelerations towards pressure voidances created by magnetism. Absolute acceleration is zero empirical movement, or perfect Ether inertia.  F=ma is correctly pertaining to \u201cmagnetism\u201d and gravity: Voidance = dielectricity as measured in mass x acceleration. As stated, magnetism cannot, has never attracted or accelerated anything, rather only causes dielectric coherency and resultant acceleration by means of dielectricity in voidance. Both gravity and so-called \u201cmagnetic attraction\u201d operate off the principle of shrinking spheres of dielectric voidance in which, as found in the case of both, the decreasing spherical area is proportional to the voidance and resulting acceleration. Faradays \u201cmissing three-fourths of the force\u201d is not missing, it is and always has been a \rtranslational exchange between increasing or decreasing space in which both magnetism and dielectricity mediate field pressures.", "comment_date": "2017-09-21T17:09:14Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "DanyDM", "comment_text": "My life is a lie", "comment_date": "2017-09-21T12:22:49Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Hexor1211", "comment_text": "Great application of relativistic thinking, but it would be very nice to mention a few things. isn&#39;t that Theory of relativity combines some older electromagnetic theories with other theories.<br>Aren&#39;t just Maxwell&#39;s Equation enough to explain the phenomenon?<br>Maxwell was before the Einstein.

His explanation is absurd.  How can you describe how magnetism works if you do not even know what a charge is?  What is a positive or a negative charge and more importantly; what makes them different?  And as far as an electric field is just a magnetic field viewed at different angles is even more nonsense.  Within electromagnetism you have two fields at right angles to each other and at right angles to the flow; one is the electric field and the other is the magnetic field.  Electric fields can have monopole moments but not magnetic fields, they are always dipolar.  This is just another church of Einstein propaganda moment and as brilliant as he was, he was not always correct and even he seriously doubted the longevity of his work.<br><br>What is a charge?  It seems rather obvious and Maxwell even referred to it as well it is a quality that is similar to what is used to describe the motion of electrons and protons and even quarks and is seen in both the micro and the macro world(spiral galaxies)., and that is spin, though, just because they use the word spin does not mean that they mean spin.  OOOO those quantum physicists and their confuscating language. <br><br>Spin is an oversimplification for it is more like a vortex and vortexes are an established quality of fluid dynamics and therefore magnetohydrodynamics. I will offer two hypothesis that does not involve Einsteinian equations. <br><br>#1~Draw a clockwise spiral on a piece of paper and right beside it draw a counterclockwise spiral of exactly the same dimensions.  This is a visual representation of the charge as spin(spiral/vortex).  Note clockwise and counterclockwise appear to move in opposite direction and therefore have opposite charge.   Fold the paper midway between the two image and see how they now appear to move in the same direction causing attraction.  Draw two clockwise circles side by side and fold the paper and they do not align up therefore repelling. <br><br>#2~This is my personal favorite and is based on the observations of Viktor Schauberger, aka, the water wizard.  His motto was, comprehend and copy nature.  Again it is all about vortici, but rather than just being clockwise or counterclockwise, they are convergent and divergent, aka, centrifugal and centripetal.  Positive charge = Q+ is centrifugal and divergent (moving from the center to the outer) and negative charge = Q- is centripetal and convergent(moving from outer edges towards the center).  The north pole is Q+ moving outward and the south pole is Q- moving inward thus attracting.", "comment_date": "2017-09-18T20:10:31Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Ratt Butt", "comment_text": "Wait, so why does the cat feel a force even when it&#39;s not moving?

This is just an intuitive thought though, so those who have more in-depth knowledge please correct me if I&#39;m wrong. Here is my explanation:<br><br>The video is fantastic! But it does get one thing wrong. When the cat is stationary, and current flows in the wire, negative charges are not the only ones moving. When you have flow of charge through a conductor you need to have equal and opposite flow of positive and negative charges in order to not have any charge buildup. This would be akin to having some system that circulates water around, and for some reason the return pipe is clogged and pressure builds up as water flows in from the other side.<br><br>In reality, both the negative and positive charges in the wire are moving at equal and opposite velocities. They are appearing to contract from the standpoint of the cat, but since they are both contracting in the same way, they cancel, and there is no net force on the cat.<br><br>Now push the cat and give it a velocity in the direction of the current. Now one of the charge velocities appears to be going faster, and the other slower (sort of like driving on the freeway where cars on your side appear to be going slower from your point of view, and cars to the other side are going freakishly fast since they are heading in the opposite direction). Now the length contractions differ, and not only that, but they work against each other and create a net contraction twice that of what you would experience with a single line of moving charge.

I was wondering, from the stationary point of view, why the electrons don&#39;t contract and attract the positive cat. It is because from the moving cat&#39;s point of view the entire world - the positive nuclei and the wire along with it - is moving. That is why the space between the positive charges contract. Because that space itself (i.e. the wire they&#39;re in) is moving in this frame of reference.<br><br>From the stationary point of view, however, only the electrons themselves are moving. This only means that the electrons are squished down a bit and get flatter, but the space between them (again, the conducting wire) is stationary. Therefore the distance between charges remains the same and there is no change in the charge density.<br><br>I feel so happy right now.<br><br>Edit: It turns out this intepretation is not entire correct. In a simplified scenario of two co-accelerating bodies there are basically two possibilities (or more like two ends of a spectrum). If the distance between them stay <b>constant from the bodies&#39; pov</b> it will <b>contract</b> from an observer&#39;s pov. If the distance stays <b>constant from an observer&#39;s pov</b> it will <b>expand</b> from the bodies&#39; pov. It depends on how/when that acceleration is applied to the different bodies.

That does not mean there are no magnetic field &quot;rings&quot; (&quot;seen&quot; by the observer). They are certainly there. If you dislocate the test charge by moving it away from that observer (and therefore changing its frame of reference), a Lorentz force can be observed because the test charge moves relative to the magnetic field &quot;rings&quot; (&quot;seen&quot; by the observer).<br><br>What this means is that the magnetic field <i>rings</i> of current flowing in a conductor are not at rest with the conductor, but rather they move at a velocity between that of the free electrons and that of the metal ions of the conductor.<br><br>Therefore, if we suppose a different frame of reference for another observer, in a coordinate system of which electrons were to travel at, say, 100 km/h (in that frame of reference), the magnetic field &quot;rings&quot; around the conductor would move in the direction of these electrons at 50 km/h (in that frame of reference), in the case that we assume the conductor (copper atoms, silver atoms, whatever) to remain at rest in that frame of reference. The Lorentz force tells us that a magnetic field moving (in that frame of reference) generates an electrical field (in that frame of reference). In this case, the magnetic field &quot;rings&quot; move longitudinally along the wire (in that frame of reference) which generates an electrical field (<b>E</b>) pointing perpendicular <i>toward</i> the wire (in that frame of reference), indicating an <i>apparent</i> negative charge.<br><br>If instead the rest frame of that observer was that of the negative charge, the wire would <i>appear</i> to have a positive charge with an electrical field (<b>E</b>) pointing <i>away</i> from the wire.<br><br>Only when, in our frame of reference, we are stationary with the magnetic field &quot;rings&quot;, does the wire <i>appear</i> completely neutral (i.e. with no electric field (<b>E</b>) pointing toward or away from the wire). Note that the drift velocity of actual electrons in a conductor is quite small even when passing high amounts of current. The drift velocity is usually on the order of mm per second. If we used a superconductor, the obtainable drift velocity could be much higher.<br><br>The difference of <i>apparent</i> charge density as observed among different frames of reference therefore arises not as the result of a real increase of electrons over that of protons in the wire (whether in quantity or density), but rather it results from the laws of <i>electromagnetic induction</i>.<br><br>Do note that the electric field of a charged particle at a given distance (<b>r</b>) depends not only on the quantity of charge (q), but also the electrical permittivity (\u03b5) at the point where the electric field is measured. So it is not, in general, necessarily the case that the presence of electric fields lines pointing toward or away from the wire indicates the presence of a net charge.<br><br>However, as soon as we assume the first of Maxwell&#39;s four equations (Gauss&#39; law), such electric fields lines pointing toward or away from a wire must imply a presence of net charge.\u00a0 However, the divergence of the fourth of Maxwell&#39;s four equations (Amp\u00e8re&#39;s circuital law (with Maxwell&#39;s addition)) derives the continuity equation for electric charges, which requires the conservation of charge with time. This implies that if we hold the interpretation of the magnetic field as being due to length contraction of electric fields to be self-evident, then the result will be that charge is not <i>invariant (among a various frames of reference)</i> although being <i>conserved (as viewed from a given frame of reference)</i>.<br><br>The previous paragraph is <i>invalid if we are speaking of a closed surface in spacetime</i> (3 dimensions of space and 1 dimension of time), in which case the electric potential not only has a gradient with respect to each spatial domain, but also a gradient with respect to the time domain as well. Only in this case do Maxwell&#39;s equations and the related Lorentz transformations allow for charge to be invariant (not just conserved). In this case, we have an electric field that is defined in 4 dimensions instead of 3. This is the case derived from the <i>Covariant Formulation of Electromagnetism</i>. In essence, any deviation in the electric field observed in the three spatial dimensions of spacetime, that varies from what would be expected from the actual charge of the wire, is compensated for by an electric field that exists on the time axis. What such an electric field (existing on the time axis of spacetime) does to a charge is <i>apparently</i> to subject it to an electrical potential derived from a charge from a different point in time (i.e. from the past if one wishes to preserve the common sense notion of causality).<br><br><b>Now let&#39;s entertain a </b><b><i>truncated</i></b><b> view, where the real electric field exists in three dimensions (per aether theory), not four (per special relativity theory)!</b><br><br>The standard view (Coulomb Gauge) is that if the point where the electric field is measured exists in a vacuum, then regardless of the relative velocity of the charge with respect to the observer, this value depends on the electric permittivity of free space (\u03b5 sub 0) or &quot;epsilon sub zero&quot;, which is a constant. Why? Electrical permittivity in the standard view describes the local properties a dielectric medium responding to the gradient of electrostatic potentials, resulting in a local electric field which depends on those properties. Therefore the electric field lines through a closed surface, in the standard view, is independent of the velocities of the charges contained in the volume that surface encloses. But this would mean this (first) standard view <i>contradicts</i> another (second) standard view, that length contraction of electric fields can explain magnetism by implying different a different charge (positive, neutral, or negative), depending on the frame of reference. This can be corrected by modifying the first standard view to say that it is wrong to assume that electric permittivity describes only local properties of the medium.<br><br>The previous paragraph and the ones following do not take into account the aspect of the standard view mentioned prior, which requires that, <i>in the context of special relativity</i>, the electric potential, as well as its corresponding gradient, to exist in four dimensions. Instead, these paragraphs apply to the <i>truncated</i> standard view (outside of special relativity) where electric fields are seen to be existing in three dimensions, especially by most practicing electrical engineers (rather than mathematical physicists who study four-dimensional spacetime). As such, among electrical engineers with only slightly above average knowledge of relativity, we have notions of variance of &quot;charge&quot; with respect to different frames of reference, as used by these people to explain the connection between electricity and magnetism from a current-carrying wire (as the video by Veritasium attempts). In classical aether theories, there is no &quot;metric space&quot; consisting of both space and time, and thus a classical aether theory proposing the invariance of charge with respect to different observers must interpret <i>differently</i> the actual experimental measurements and calculated values derived from theory. Classical aether theory does not support an electric potential gradient existing on the time axis.<br><br>In the <i>truncated</i> view (electric and magnetic fields existing only in three dimensional space), does the &quot;charge&quot; of the wire (q) really vary depending the frame of reference? Maybe not. Perhaps it is the electrical permittivity of particles comprising the metal atoms and the free electrons which depends on frame of reference (or in turn, the relative velocity of these charges in the frame of reference of the observer). Note that this requires electrical permittivity to be a function of the relative velocity of the electric field source / sink. This would allow for invariance of charge (q) in the truncated view, while still preserving the relationship between electricity and magnetism (that the video by Veritasium attempted to establish in the separate, standard, context of special relativity). Said another way, the alternative, <i>truncated</i> view suggests that the integration of the electric field (<b>E</b>) (units of V/m) over a closed surface (units of V <i>times</i> m) containing only one moving electron will result in a value which varies with the velocity of the charge relative to the surface (a surface defined in the coordinates of the observer&#39;s frame of reference), while the integration of the electric <i>displacement</i> field (<b>D</b>) (units of q/m^2) over the same closed surface (units of q) does not vary with that same velocity.<br><br>.... Alternatively, applying invariance of a &quot;charge&quot; to the <i>truncated</i> view could imply the opposite. That is to say that instead perhaps the closed surface integration of <b>E</b>, not <b>D</b>, is what remains constant regardless of the velocity of the electron enclosed in that surface. In this case, a &quot;charge&quot; of quantity V <i>times</i> m (= q / (q / (V <i>times</i> m))) is conserved as opposed to a &quot;charge&quot; of quantity q. V <i>times</i> m (volts <i>times</i> meters) shares the same units as electric flux, and thus this second alternative implies the invariance of electric flux though a closed surface, though not necessarily of charge. This is not to be confused with conservation of electric flux through a closed surface. General conservation of a quantity (substance) is attained by a continuity equation, while invariance of this quantity is obtained by comparing integrations calculated in the various proper coordinate systems assigned to inertial frames of reference of separate, distinct observers.", "comment_date": "2014-08-09T19:51:36Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Josh", "comment_text": "but wait this only explains magnets while things are moving? dont magnets still work on two stationary objects?<br>is there no sceneario where the staitionary kitty will attract?", "comment_date": "2014-08-09T18:40:27Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "deisisase", "comment_text": "Permanent magnets=Quantum mechanics; Eletro-magnents=Special Relativity? perhaps this is where the laws of the universe unite!

It seems to me that by arguments similar to those in the video, in the case that there is a current of electrons in a wire, length contraction implies that the electrons should be more densely packed in the wire than the positive charges. Therefore, there should be a net negative charge on the wire, which will exert a force on the cat. However, Maxwell&#39;s equations completely oppose this conclusion, because while the current does produce a magnetic field, the cat&#39;s not moving in that reference frame, and so the magnetic force is zero. What&#39;s up with that? I suspect it might have to do with the fact that the wire is moving with respect to the cat in the dynamic case, not, as was stated in the video, the charges.
