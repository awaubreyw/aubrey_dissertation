I believe it is actualy all one substance that is fluid that can be observable from our perspective depending on its state at the particular location.

I&#39;m super drunk and it&#39;s the middle of the night, but have you calculated for the expansion of space (time) when calculating the amount of energy of a cubic centimetre at a given time? If the experienced expansion isn&#39;t exactly the same, due to for example black holes which could distort it or send black mather inwards countering percieved calculations, this will shift the amount of particles during the time of measurement and also their energy giving a wonky result.

Feynman simplified this by illustrating the perturbative terms as diagrams. Later, people seemed to start viewing these mathematical crutches as graphs of actual physical events. As a result of this being an approximation, the calculations are limited in accuracy, flawed in the sense that they need to be truncated or else the diverge, and are unable to explain gravity in a quantum sense because it doesn&#39;t converge.

Gravity is, according to Einstein, not a &quot;force&quot; but a curvature of spacetime caused by the presence of mass. Meanwhile, the inflationary model describes the Big Bang and subsequent evolution of the Universe as an expansion of spacetime itself. So it seems strange to now hear the acceleration of the expansion described as being caused by some kind of &quot;repulsive&quot; force or energy, when gravity is not reckoned in terms of gravitons or fields, but rather in terms of the geometry of non-space things in relative motion.<br><br>So my further question is, rather than ascribing the expansion of spacetime to the presence of virtual particles, why isn&#39;t it considered in terms of the spacetime geometry itself? Is &quot;space&quot; merely the absence of &quot;energy&quot; or is it something in itself? Furthermore, if virtual particles come in and out of existence in an X-particles-per-cubic-meter kind of way, doesn&#39;t this imply that as space expands, so the amount of virtual energy is also forever increasing at the same rate?<br><br>Back to the notion of dark energy or dark matter being related to the accelerated expansion of space\u2026 How can that possibly be intuited, since it implies that all the dark energy between here and the farthest object is in some sense &quot;pushing them apart.&quot; Is this nonlocality writ large? Especially since the most distant objects are &quot;receding&quot; away from each other at a rate much &quot;faster&quot; than the speed of light. Again, this all sounds like an issue of spacetime geometry itself, and not energy or fields.<br><br>One last point. Is space &quot;real&quot; vis-a-vis two entangled particles at opposite ends of the Universe? If there is a non-spatial causal connection between the remotest entities, perhaps we should consider what we call &quot;space&quot; as something within matter and energy \u2014 a collectively-shared tidbit of information \u2014 rather than as something that energy and matter are &quot;swimming in.&quot;<br><br>Food for thought\u2026?", "comment_date": "2016-09-09T05:25:28Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Tom W", "comment_text": "This really shows me how far we still have to go with understanding quantum mechanics.", "comment_date": "2016-09-09T05:25:05Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "biz", "comment_text": "I wish you&#39;d upload more :( <br>great videos though :)", "comment_date": "2016-09-09T05:24:31Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Wolven Avalanche", "comment_text": "3.666.666 Subscribers.

Ergo if all fields had a virtual  fluctuation of a particle at the same time and that could be precisely measured you&#39;d catch the 10^112 erg predicted, but since it is so unlikely to happen we are still seeing empty space with quantum fluctuations that solely yield 10^-8erg.

There&#39;s an infinite number of solutions to the Schr\u00f6dinger equation for the hydrogen atom for this particular energy level and this particular angular momentum.

You can only do that for 3 electrons in the p orbital (6 if you include spin), because the solution is 3-dimensional. Note that the 3 dimensions are NOT the space dimensions we live in.

Personally, I think when are inside the event horizon of a super massive black hole, and the apparent expansion we observe is just due to tidal forces as some points are closer to the singularity and others further. This will explain many things. The Hubble horizon. The Accelerated rate of expansion. The fact that the Schwartz-child radius of the observable universe is close to the actual radius of the observable universe.

The way you explained about diffraction of light by using a pin hole and how far moon is from earth or gyroscopic wheel, is what made me a fan on this channel. Somehow, in recent times, your channel is moving towards complicated topics which might not be interesting to general public. I always believed in making things simple for people and your channel did it very well along with others like vsauce and smarter everyday, the engineer guy or tom scott. I really wish that those type of simpler but interesting ignored topics come back.
