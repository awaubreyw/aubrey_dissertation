I teach physics and use many of your videos as I explain topics illuminated by both your video demonstrations and your walking through the process of how to think about the observations.  For the slinky video, I wanted to suggest a new slow-motion video to test a hypothesis and perhaps better demonstrate the phenomenon.  Take two identical slinkys suspended from the same height in the same frame for the slow motion capture.  One slinky is allowed to stretch out as in your other videos.  The other starts in the compressed state, with it&#39;s bottom compressed up flush with the top.  Release the top of the extended slinky at the same time as you release the compressed slinky.  My hypothesis is that the top of the extended slinky is travelling down faster than the acceleration of gravity, since the top loop of metal is being pulled down both by gravity and the elastic force of the spring below.  So the falling compressed slinky should lag behind the compressing top of the extended slinky until it compresses completely.  From there they should fall parallel and hit the ground at the same time.", "comment_date": "2021-07-26T18:28:24Z", "likes_count": 4}, {"comment_by": "Arsh", "comment_text": "Just drawing a free body diagram at both points right before and after the drop should give the answer .
