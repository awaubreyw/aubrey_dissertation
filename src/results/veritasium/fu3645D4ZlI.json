I assume that its orbit is in a place of equilibrium where the gravitational force pulling the dwarf star in matches the centripetal force of the spin pushing it out.  But then a star gets sucked into the black hole.  Wouldn&#39;t that massively change the gravity of the black hole?  According to your explanation, such an event would also increase the spin, but are we saying that increase in mass and increase in spin are equivalent somehow?  Or did the dwarf star change its orbital pattern after this event?  I guess we can&#39;t compare before &amp; after, but is it in any way possible that it DIDN&#39;T change its orbital pattern after such a dramatic event?  How would a star getting sucked into a black hole change the trajectory of an object already in orbit around that black hole?  Wouldn&#39;t it disturb the orbital pattern greatly in the short run, then, settling down, cast the dwarf star into a new long-term orbital pattern?  The bigger implication of what I&#39;m asking is whether the dwarf star was actually there and orbiting in that manner before the event, or if the event introduced the dwarf star into orbit or somehow dramatically changed its orbit.

It appears from our point of reference that the universe is expanding, but in fact it&#39;s accelerating towards the centre. Lastly, we see stars all around us because the black hole is bending light from the opposite side around it which for us makes it appear as if stars are in every direction.&quot;", "comment_date": "2021-12-10T12:30:25Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Sarah Lebhar", "comment_text": "What is spacetime like inside the event horizon of a black hole?", "comment_date": "2021-12-09T23:17:34Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "\u8f9b\u5411\u4e2d", "comment_text": "nice", "comment_date": "2021-12-09T21:55:24Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Armour Dude", "comment_text": "<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fu3645D4ZlI&amp;t=3m06s\">3:06</a><br>gyro- hold my metal balls", "comment_date": "2021-12-07T13:48:36Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "musicalfringe", "comment_text": "Ah, an annular ring.

However, I do not believe that black holes migrate, I believe that we and all the planets and celestial bodies migrate towards them. A continuous process of balancing energies. It seems that not everything was born out of nothing without an initial vibration. The vibration caused the vacuum to break into equal opposing forces, which were separated and so the mass-carrying light was carried away by the vibration wave, and the antimatter (darkness) remained in place because it was not subject to the influence of vibration. Therefore, the black, hungry hole appeared to compensate for its negative energy. There may have been several Big Bang nuclei made up of a single vibration, but only the generator / creator of that vibration could know how many there were. It is possible to perceive something related to this, maybe the reflected reverberations, maybe the fact that the earth is like a living being and from the nucleus to the surface magma, everything is moving.

A star is an omnidirectional emitter of coherent electromagnetic waves! In essence, we see a pillar of a ray of light! Everything is very simple! We see stars only because our Sun in our galaxy flies in sync with the rest of the stars! The distance between the stars is increasing, but it is so very - a slow process that lasts for millions of years. That is, an astronomer cannot observe the change in such long processes, since Earth time flies by with lightning speed! And so, now we know that distant stars are statically attached to one coordinate point in the sky, but why does the light of the stars travels so long distances, reaching our optic nerve? 4746<br><br>It&#39;s all about COHERENCE! The emitted light of the stars forms a kind of laser beam of light, in one of the radiation spectra such as X-rays this radiation is most effective. The rotation of the stars around their axis further enhances the coherence by pumping the beam. In fact, we see a column of a ray of light, but we see only that beam-column that flies in our direction, forming a peak - an energy point. In neighboring solar systems, people observe the phase radiation of the beam but several degrees to the side. The formed point in the sky confirms that the star is exactly in the place of its coordinates! if the Star could move relative to our Sun, then no coherent ray would be able to form.<br><br>  <a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/125896111@N07/50431730627/in/dateposted-public/\">https://www.flickr.com/photos/125896111@N07/50431730627/in/dateposted-public/</a>", "comment_date": "2020-10-07T13:56:25Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "SigEpBlue", "comment_text": "&quot;Naked singularity&quot; might make a good band name.", "comment_date": "2020-10-07T06:25:40Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Jarryd Beck", "comment_text": "They are pulsating electrical objects.

Everything fine. But there is a problem here. It is impossible to hide behind a black hole. For instance, if a star gets eclipsed by a black hole, its image, seem from a point of view far apart, turn into a ring that goes around the shade of black hole (the edge of the visible event horizon) and merges with itself again on the other side. A white dwarf that is orbiting the black hole doesn&#39;t get dimmer as it passes behind the black hole. How can we observe periodic oscillations on the intensity of the white dwarf x-rays if it doesn&#39;t get dimmer? I think some ingredient in your explanation, which is wonderful, is missing. Perhaps the oscillations in the intensity are due to a different effect. Yes, you are right. It is due to red shifting caused by the spin.

Thus less spin should be an indicator for a &quot;denser&quot; black hole coming closer to a true singularity, while the shape tha we see becomes larger. This would provoce the question: Should something truely being infinite dense (so a singularity) should be not be spinning at all and be infintly large at the same time consuming everything/ the whole universe?<br>Like relativly speaking.. the more it consumes and denser it becomes, it appears bigger because it has just consumed more mass.<br>Like if you would blow up a ballon, fill it up with a little but of something floating around (e.g. dust) and let that represent suff floating around in our universe. <br>Poke a hole in the ballon and stuff will be blown out.

I do have a question though and I apologize for  potential ridiculousness of it as astro-physics or or really any physics is very far from being my daily subjects of involvement but are much of personal curiosity.  So if the massive star that got eaten by the black hole actually got consumed while passing by the black hole then wouldn&#39;t it&#39;s trajectory have to intersect with the actual event horizon of the black hole in order to be effected or is the animation just not correct? Also wouldn&#39;t the mass of the star that got eaten have to be smaller than that or the dwarf star that is apparently circling the black hole emitting those x-rays in order to experience effect of the gravity since the dwarf star manages to circle around without the experience of the same effect? and lastly how come there is any light or debris left circling the black hole? by my logic if the large massive start got engulfed while passing by then there really shouldn&#39;t be anything left from it and only hawking radiation would get emitted according to some earlier videos from this channel.

Thanks for all that information. <br><br>If you want to live a blessed happy life in this world and even happier after death, and find the answers for all your questions and reach the ultimate truth, then learn about Islam. Once you&#39;re convinced, become a Muslim. Worship the only one God who doesn&#39;t have a parent nor son, doesn&#39;t have a partner nor equal. He is the creator, the all merciful all gracious, the almighty the all hearing all seeing, the all knowing all wise. He controls everything. He is Allah.<br><br>Practice Islam according to the teachings of Quran and authentic Hadith. Quran is the last book that has Allah&#39;s words after the previous ones were changed such as Torah and Gospel. Not even a single verse in Quran was ever changed since 1400 years ago. Hadith is a collection of Prophet Muhammad&#39;s sayings, actions, approvals... etc. <br><br>following Muhammad means that you&#39;re following Jesus, Moses, Jacob, Ibrahim, Noah all the way to Adam may peace and blessings be upon all of them. All prophets came with the same message and belief, Islam. They all were Muslims. <br><br>Everything is being recorded, everything you say do... etc at every second and part of a second. Every good deed you do for the sake of Allah such as praying, helping others... gives you Hasanat in your records and it&#39;s multiplied by ten or 700 or more by Allah&#39;s mercy. And every bad deed gives Sayi&#39;ah. It can be erased by asking Allah forgiveness and many other good deeds. <br><br>After we all die and the of judgement day comes, we will be all asked and held accountable for how we led our lives. The Hasanat and Sayi&#39;at in our records are going to put on a scale. If sayi&#39;at are more we fall in the hell fire due to our bad deeds and corruption of our hearts and souls. The worse the person the lower the level in it. If Hasanat are more then we are granted the paradise by the mercy of Allah. The better the person the higher the level grated. The lowest level of paradise is way better than all heavens and earth. Note that all billions of light years observed by scientists until now are not even the edge of the first heaven. And the first is not even a ring in a desert compared to the second. And so on the higher the bigger. The paradise has what no eye has seen, no ear has heard and no heart has ever imagined. It&#39;s more beyond. <br><br>Some of those who fall into the hell fire will be forgiven by Allah and enter by Allah&#39;s mercy into the paradise. However whoever enters the paradise will never get out. <br><br>Sorry to make long. <br><br>And Peace Be Upon Those Who Follow The Guidance.", "comment_date": "2019-01-13T03:40:31Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "megamanmadrid", "comment_text": "I&#39;ve been seeying astronomy videos for years now, but this just blew my mind...

The smaller planet of like-charge will disassemble itself shortly before actual contact in an unavoidable collision path. E-charge carries by Ether in our cosmos also act as a distributed depository of scattering molecule and dust of all types, as building materials for the future planets, charge in Ether space is unconstrained (unlike charge in a capacitor) soon become less homogenous in space, we have charge differential and charge migration producing space plasma or filament named after a Norwegian scientist, as Birkeland current, a plasma in cosmic scale. There are countless number of filaments in space, interestingly each filament attracts its nearest member begins to helix (tangle) each other by the magnetic fields each created. Under little to no constrain, more and more filament pairs begins to form macro filament, until there is less and less charge available to sustain the growth. Such a cosmic plasma is visible by high power telescope. As explained earlier that cosmic plasma is a collection of energy in the form of E-charge also collected tiny particles including molecules and atoms along with. On the other hand, the section of cosmic filament with a higher current density is responsible to a stronger local H-field, collecting more filaments to an even higher current density, soon enters a run away state known as filament pinching by the cosmic scale, such pinching brought along distributed space dust by the cosmic scale into one spot, welding them up into an infant planet. When a planet were born along a cosmic filament there is a daisy chain of sibling planets were also born along a common rotational axis or polar but orbits, gravity keeps those sibling close together while planetary E-charge repel them apart. As no two (like polarity) planetary charges are equal, when they meet there were inter-planet discharge, a low energy discharge is invisible, to a visible glow intermediate and thunder bold visible violent at the extreme. Inter-planet separation along a rotational begins unstable and gradually more stable, as long as charge difference remains relative low but can enter unstable later when charge difference reemerge, as one member further receive or loose charge from a visiting planet. Those were some conditions by which our pre-floor ancient relatives were able to see sibling planets at a very very close distance, such as the rings of Saturn, scar face Mars and curly hair Venus.

I&#39;ve been giving them some thought recently too and come to my own understanding about how they work and what must be inside them, based on maths and facts that we already have. Since a black hole on a penrose diagram shows that the singularity is not a physical location but rather an eventual time - which makes sense since if you fell into a black hole you would inevitably meet the singularity at some point -  I believe it means that falling through the hole would mean falling down the 4th axis, or dimension, which must be time. This is reinforced by the fact that space and time are switched inside a black hole on a penrose diagram, and the closer you get to the event horizon, the more time warps, as we&#39;re reminded in the film &#39;Interstellar&#39;. This means inside the black hole is a tunnel straight through time itself. As well, when we show mass curving space-time with the 3D universe being shown as a 2D grid that warps along he 3rd axis, I think the dip in space-time caused by the black hole does indeed still have a bottom, and that this means all the mass that formed the singularity is definitely still in there in some sort of physical form, most likely still with a 3D size, even. That&#39;s just what I&#39;ve been able to discern from what I know, and I&#39;m no scientist. I would love to hear what other people&#39;s thoughts are.
