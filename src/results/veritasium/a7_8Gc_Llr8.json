Einstein&#39;s equations are NECESSARILY ELECTROMAGNETIC/GRAVITATIONAL. Notice the term c4. GREAT !!! ELECTROMAGNETISM/ENERGY IS GRAVITY. This is proven by F=ma AND E=mc2. I have provided top down, true, and overwhelming mathematical proof AS WELL that gravity IS ELECTROMAGNETISM/energy. So, It is now abundantly and quite clear that Einstein never nearly understood gravity AND physics/physical experience. (Obviously, E=mc2 is DIRECTLY and fundamentally derived from F=ma.) Sir Isaac Newton now ranks second.<br><br>Very importantly, outer &quot;space&quot; involves full inertia; AND it is fully invisible AND black.<br><br>In fact, the ROTATION of the moon does MATCH it&#39;s REVOLUTION. ACCORDINGLY, gravity/acceleration involves BALANCED inertia/INERTIAL RESISTANCE; as gravity IS ELECTROMAGNETISM/energy. SO, a given planet sweeps out equal areas in equal times; AND this is THEN consistent WITH F=ma, E=mc2, AND what is perpetual motion; as ELECTROMAGNETISM/energy is gravity. Therefore, GRAVITATIONAL force/energy is proportional to (or balanced with/as) inertia/INERTIAL RESISTANCE; as gravity is electromagnetism/energy. So, &quot;mass&quot;/energy involves balanced inertia/inertial resistance consistent WITH what is BALANCED ELECTROMAGNETIC/GRAVITATIONAL force/energy; as ELECTROMAGNETISM/ENERGY IS GRAVITY. It ALL makes perfect sense. E=mc2 IS F=ma. The stars AND PLANETS are POINTS in the night sky. (&quot;Mass&quot;/ENERGY IS GRAVITY. ELECTROMAGNETISM/energy is gravity. E=mc2 IS F=ma.) It ALL CLEARLY makes perfect sense. Objects fall at the SAME RATE (neglecting air resistance, of course), AS ELECTROMAGNETISM/energy is gravity. Gravity IS ELECTROMAGNETISM/energy. BALANCE and completeness go hand in hand. E=mc2 IS F=ma. Gravity AND ELECTROMAGNETISM/energy are linked AND BALANCED opposites, AS ELECTROMAGNETISM/energy is gravity.

Since ion is mobile resistance, which it is escaping electrons. So, mobile resistance to stationary resistance so it causes current which it is fire that is plasma. So, it tells you behind all four that is solid, liquid, gas, and plasma is ion. But those three is stationary resistance so it is non-ion. Plasma is ion so it is mobile resistance. So, it can be liquid plasma, gas plasma which that is flame which it is connect to another gas that is air. So, air produce gas. So, if it is liquid, would it produce liquid plasma? That is lava? So, what is plasma solid? It has not been invent. Well, lava is not liquid plasma, but higher heat of solid that convert into mass. The process of lava and plasma is different that is. Fire is ion itself in motion. Lava is non-ion itself in motion. So, fire give you new understanding behind the mass. And the connect between mass and fire that is stationary ion which center ion holds itself which it has limit motion. External that pull electrons and internal that pull electrons, so it is a battle internal so seeking to flat out so everything is equal at all level. But external that is pulling so electrons will remain so the codeprint of electrons is the kind of mass. Fire is non-mass, but like spirit or so. It brings new definition for opposite of mass that is stationary which it is gas, liquid, and solid, and gas itself has lower bond that hold air so it needs higher bond that is external which firmament above us. <br><br>So, it fits well for search the truth, as long as you don&#39;t dirty the truth by being bias. It would be good to keep going to gain understanding for more truth. So, it also tell you about pressure connect to ions. Higher ion density will override the resistance which it is pressure which it is holding electrons. So, if the speed or density is either high enough or combine as each one at lower level will combine to high enough to override resistance so it reduces so it becomes another phase of mass. So, like a big person pushes a boy to ground, but a boy can&#39;t push a big ground to ground because the big person is bigger. So, a boy run at high speed and impact the big person using his feet horizontally to push the big person. So, lower pressure with high speed that convert into higher pressure. So, behind everything base on video show pressure is everything which underlie those 4 elements. So, the 5th element is Aether which at lowest pressure density so all is even. Rise the density at one spot, so that spot become a resistance which it holds itself so it will not pull down to lower level, so it is an internal battle, push and pull. Well, not push, but pull of one side and pull of another. <br><br>So, it is opposite of two, not opposite of two that is different, but opposite of two that is same. Unlike woman and man are different, but it is two mans on opposite side that is different. It is good to make it simple which it is logical so it simple add to next level, so new logical form. All it needs extra something. Like 1 + 1, so there is extra for 1 + 1, that is space, and + that is represent which mean add, and another space, so all of those math I mention is characters, so behind everything is aether, but those aether is a represent to be add or subtract, so 1 as character is a represent is whole, and another characters is a represent is space and so on. Mainstream make it too complex, not thinking logically or resist logically to see the connect, but add complex to logical like if you have a headache, you need aspirin. Not understanding the connect between headache of current compare to non-headache of before. So, it is illogical for you have headache so find the reason for it, but not add in wrong way, but right way with understanding.", "comment_date": "2019-02-14T23:36:23Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Tarang Patil", "comment_text": "What language is that", "comment_date": "2019-01-23T13:03:09Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Ajay Yadav", "comment_text": "most stunning!!!!", "comment_date": "2019-01-13T14:16:00Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Xavier Lemaire", "comment_text": "Perfect video for my science class ;)", "comment_date": "2019-01-05T14:30:02Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Noname Noname", "comment_text": "Lightsaber", "comment_date": "2018-12-30T16:42:10Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Keith Reynolds", "comment_text": "I wonder if the application of an electric field supplies the extra energy to make a flame a plasma.", "comment_date": "2018-12-27T18:08:30Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Zhi SUN", "comment_text": "\u592a\u7cbe\u5f69\u4e86\uff0c\u6211\u53ea\u662f\u60f3\u8fc7\u8fd9\u4e2a\u5b9e\u9a8c\uff0c\u800c\u4f60\u4eec\u771f\u7684\u53bb\u505a\u4e86\uff0c\u5389\u5bb3\u4e86\uff01", "comment_date": "2018-12-19T07:13:29Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "NightDancer Gaming", "comment_text": "Im sorry Internet I cannot help myself but the model of this statue had perfect tits :-D <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7_8Gc_Llr8&amp;t=0m06s\">0:06</a>", "comment_date": "2018-11-27T20:46:27Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Syed Khalid", "comment_text": "Can I do this thing with the 2 huge magnets??...

Flames start with some sort of fuel like in the wick of a candle and rapidly react with the oxygen in the air after some activation energy is introduced, aka heat. The oxygen atoms rapidly remove the electrons in the fuel\u2019s atoms. As a result of this reaction, energy is released and is absorbed by the products and reactants and converted into their temperature. Light is then emitted and received by our eyes as the image of a flame. The flame itself has high temperatures and the light transfers enough energy to our skin to warm our skin up.

In overhead high voltage electrical distribution systems when branches fall into them, or components fail, there are fires all the time. Flames are conductive from these fires and can cause continuous arcing between the phases when there is a flame between the phases, or betwen the phases and ground. The flame reduces the clearance distance between the phases as the flame is literally conductive. The arc jumps because the air becomes  ionized, since the distance has been shortened by a conductive presence within the distances that normally allow free air to be the insulator or dielectric,  and it is attracted to the closest point of conduction, which is the least path of resistance to the opposite phase or ground. Since the candle&#39;s flame is conductive, since there is a lot of carbon emitted from the flame, the creepage distance is being shortened closer than it&#39;s normal clearance distance and the high voltage forms a corona discharge, ionizing the air, and it jumps to the conductive flame, then it continues it&#39;s path through what is now ionized on the other side of the flame to the oppositely charged  conductor, completing the shortest path as a return to either an opposite phase or ground. In phase to phase faults,  there is always more of an attraction because there is a greater difference in potential. Phase to ground is always a lower voltage because when there is a grounded neutral, it always comes from a center tap of a transformer where the voltage is split in half,.With high voltages, since they ionize the air, they jump with great force, and, the proof is there, the flame causes conduction.  Not all fire is conductive, it all matters how much carbon is left over and in the flame from the compounds that are set on fire, since fire separates the compounds and breaks them down into their key elements, or transforms the compounds into other compounds, releasing carbons while they work, kind of the same thing acids do, except they work to transform without ignition. If you burn a candle, wax has large quantities of carbon left over that carry into a flame. Carbon is one of the most conductive elements on the planet and is the base element of all organic compounds. This is why the candle flame leaves a soot residue when put close to objects such as white ceilings, etc. If we have a flame from clean alcohol, the majority of the carbon is gone from the burn process and the flame is blue. The flame most likely is already of a close to pure plasma state, however, fire does contain plasma but isn&#39;t a plasma per se. It is fire.. Ionized molecules are energized and therefore conductive. Fire can be conductive, but again more experimentation is needed to say all flames are conductive,. I would imagine that all organic compounds that are burnt will create a carbon flame and it should be orange, as well conductive. Add more oxygen and this can all change, leaning the emission away from the flame causing a cleaner burn and less conductivity. Carbons can be compounded together to also create insulators, such as rubber, however, if we burn rubber, the flame from the rubber is highly conductive because of the very high carbon emissions and nasty smokey flame.
