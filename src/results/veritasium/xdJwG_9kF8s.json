Luke 13:1-5 There were present at that season some that told him of the Galilaeans, whose blood Pilate had mingled with their sacrifices. 2 And Jesus answering said unto them, Suppose ye that these Galilaeans were sinners above all the Galilaeans, because they suffered such things? 3 I tell you, Nay: but, except ye repent, ye shall all likewise perish. 4 Or those eighteen, upon whom the tower of Siloam fell, and slew them, think ye that they were sinners above all men that dwelt in Jerusalem? 5 I tell you, Nay: but, except ye repent, ye shall all likewise perish. Matthew <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xdJwG_9kF8s&amp;t=6m33s\">6:33</a> But seek ye first the kingdom of God, and his righteousness; and all these things shall be added unto you. Isaiah 55:7 Let the wicked forsake his way, and the unrighteous man his thoughts: and let him return unto the LORD, and he will have mercy upon him; and to our God, for he will abundantly pardon. Luke <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xdJwG_9kF8s&amp;t=9m23s\">9:23</a>-27 And he said to them all, If any man will come after me, let him deny himself, and take up his cross daily, and follow me. 24 For whosoever will save his life shall lose it: but whosoever will lose his life for my sake, the same shall save it. 25 For what is a man advantaged, if he gain the whole world, and lose himself, or be cast away? 26 For whosoever shall be ashamed of me and of my words, of him shall the Son of man be ashamed, when he shall come in his own glory, and in his Father&#39;s, and of the holy angels. 27 But I tell you of a truth, there be some standing here, which shall not taste of death, till they see the kingdom of God. Matthew <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xdJwG_9kF8s&amp;t=19m16s\">19:16</a>-28 And, behold, one came and said unto him, Good Master, what good thing shall I do, that I may have eternal life? 17 And he said unto him, Why callest thou me good? there is none good but one, that is, God: but if thou wilt enter into life, keep the commandments. 18 He saith unto him, Which? Jesus said, Thou shalt do no murder, Thou shalt not commit adultery, Thou shalt not steal, Thou shalt not bear false witness, 19 Honour thy father and thy mother: and, Thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself. 20 The young man saith unto him, All these things have I kept from my youth up: what lack I yet? 21 Jesus said unto him, If thou wilt be perfect, go and sell that thou hast, and give to the poor, and thou shalt have treasure in heaven: and come and follow me. 22 But when the young man heard that saying, he went away sorrowful: for he had great possessions. 23 Then said Jesus unto his disciples, Verily I say unto you, That a rich man shall hardly enter into the kingdom of heaven. 24 And again I say unto you, It is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle, than for a rich man to enter into the kingdom of God. 25 When his disciples heard it, they were exceedingly amazed, saying, Who then can be saved? 26 But Jesus beheld them, and said unto them, With men this is impossible; but with God all things are possible. 27 Then answered Peter and said unto him, Behold, we have forsaken all, and followed thee; what shall we have therefore? 28 And Jesus said unto them, Verily I say unto you, That ye which have followed me, in the regeneration when the Son of man shall sit in the throne of his glory, ye also shall sit upon twelve thrones, judging the twelve tribes of Israel. Galatians <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xdJwG_9kF8s&amp;t=2m16s\">2:16</a>-21 Knowing that a man is not justified by the works of the law, but by the faith of Jesus Christ, even we have believed in Jesus Christ, that we might be justified by the faith of Christ, and not by the works of the law: for by the works of the law shall no flesh be justified. 17 But if, while we seek to be justified by Christ, we ourselves also are found sinners, is therefore Christ the minister of sin? God forbid. 18 For if I build again the things which I destroyed, I make myself a transgressor. 19 For I through the law am dead to the law, that I might live unto God. 20 I am crucified with Christ: nevertheless I live; yet not I, but Christ liveth in me: and the life which I now live in the flesh I live by the faith of the Son of God, who loved me, and gave himself for me. 21 I do not frustrate the grace of God: for if righteousness come by the law, then Christ is dead in vain. 1 Corinthians <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xdJwG_9kF8s&amp;t=1m18s\">1:18</a> For the preaching of the cross is to them that perish foolishness; but unto us which are saved it is the power of God. Romans <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xdJwG_9kF8s&amp;t=1m15s\">1:15</a>-17 So, as much as in me is, I am ready to preach the gospel to you that are at Rome also. 16 For I am not ashamed of the gospel of Christ: for it is the power of God unto salvation to every one that believeth; to the Jew first, and also to the Greek. 17 For therein is the righteousness of God revealed from faith to faith: as it is written the just shall live by faith. Romans 5:8 But God commendeth his love toward us, in that while we were yet sinners, Christ died for us. Psalms 19:7 The law of the LORD is perfect, converting the soul: the testimony of the LORD is sure, making wise the simple. Ezekiel <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xdJwG_9kF8s&amp;t=18m30s\">18:30</a>-32 Therefore I will judge you, O house of Israel, every one according to his ways, saith the LORD GOD. Repent, and turn yourselves from all your transgressions; so iniquity shall not be your ruin. 31 Cast away from you all your transgressions whereby ye have transgressed; and make you a new heart and a new spirit: for why will ye die, O house of Israel? 32 For I have no pleasure in the death of him that dieth, saith the LORD GOD: wherefore turn yourselves, and live ye. Romans <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xdJwG_9kF8s&amp;t=3m19s\">3:19</a>-25 Now we know that what things soever the law saith, it saith to them who are under the law: that every mouth may be stopped, and all the world may become guilty before God. 20 Therefore by the deeds of the law there shall no flesh be justified in his sight: for by the law is the knowledge of sin. 21 But now the righteousness of God without the law is manifested, being witnessed by the law and prophets; 22 Even the righteousness of God which is by faith of Jesus Christ unto all and upon all them that believe: for there is no difference: 23 For all have sinned, and come short of the glory of God; 24 Being justified freely by his grace through the redemption that is in Christ Jesus: 25 Whom God hath set forth to be a propitiation through faith in his blood, to declare his righteousness for the remission of sins that are past, through the forbearance of God; Acts <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xdJwG_9kF8s&amp;t=26m18s\">26:18</a>-20 To open their eyes, and to turn them from darkness to light, and from the power of Satan unto God, that they may receive forgiveness of sins, and inheritance among them which are sanctified by faith that is in me. 19 Whereupon, O king Aggripa, I was not disobedient unto the heavenly vision: 20 But shewed first unto them of Damascus, and at Jerusalem, and throughout all the coasts of Judaea, and then to the Gentiles, that they should repent and turn to God, and do works meet for repentance. Matthew <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xdJwG_9kF8s&amp;t=5m27s\">5:27</a>-28 Ye have heard that it was said by them of old time, Thou shalt not commit adultery: 28 But I say unto you, That whosoever looketh on a woman to lust after her hath committed adultery with her already in his heart. Matthew <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xdJwG_9kF8s&amp;t=12m41s\">12:41</a> The men of Nineveh shall rise in judgment with this generation, and shall condemn it: because they repented at the preaching of Jonas; and behold, a greater than Jonas is here. Hebrews 11:1 Now faith is the substance of things hoped for, the evidence of things not seen. Hebrews <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xdJwG_9kF8s&amp;t=4m12s\">4:12</a> For the word of God is quick, and powerful, and sharper than any twoedged sword, piercing even to the dividing asunder of soul and spirit, and of the joints and marrow, and is a discerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart. John 14:6 Jesus saith unto him, I am the way, the truth and the life: no man cometh unto the Father, but by me. John 16:8-11 And when he is come, he will reprove the world of sin, and of righteousness, and of judgment: 9 Of sin because they believe not on me; 10 Of righteousness, because I go to my Father, and ye see me no more; 11 Of judgment, because the prince of this world is judged.", "comment_date": "2020-08-19T06:52:53Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "V Blox", "comment_text": "I have a question, if you pushed on a person and then pulled on a person afterwards would you go backwards then stop because of the force of only you and nothing around it or would you go the opposite direction or would you stay in place.", "comment_date": "2020-08-19T05:56:40Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Raiyan Bashir", "comment_text": "Its not a zero G plane , its a normal plane .<br>there is nothing called zero G plane", "comment_date": "2020-08-19T05:35:30Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "TRICKSTA", "comment_text": "One day when I become rich...", "comment_date": "2020-08-19T02:28:41Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "sophie.q6", "comment_text": "Jemand aus Deutschland", "comment_date": "2020-08-18T23:42:59Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Megot", "comment_text": "Haha le cameo de E-pens\u00e9 !

So if you had a person who weighs in at 30 kilos in 0-G you would do 0.2 grams because hyper gravity is add 0.8 grams to 1 gram than 0-G would be 1 gram take away 0.8 which is 0.2 grams than the sum of that persons weight is 30 multiplied by 0.2 grams from the 0-G effect that persons body weight in 0-G is 6 kilos therefore in weightlessness you have a weight which for anyone who is exactly 30 kilograms is 6 kilograms and the weight for that 30 kilo person in hyper gravity is 30 multiplied by 1.8 which equals 54 so a persons weight in hyper gravity that in usual gravity is 30 kilos is 54 kilos. Sorry for long sentence at start I was really focused on my theory. I also invented a new word gravities which is a metaphor for all the possible amounts of grams that a persons body weight is multiplied by in the many possibilities of gravity like hyper gravity, martian gravity and 0 gravity and know I need to write this down onto paper and submit it for a Nobel Prize in physics. Although there is one or more flaws in this firstly they don&#39;t call it 0 gravity / weightlessness for nothing.

I used to go on it again and again &#39;til I got sick. But anyway, a LOT of people out there and just about every single movie making team for every film ever set in space seem to think that if you rotated a section of a spacecraft <del>or indeed, rotated the entire craft/ station</del> that you could  then use that same centrifugal force to pin you to the walls, thus simulating gravity.<br><br>This is a mistake. Such devices will do no such thing, and I sincerely hope that no space-pioneers are ever so absurdly short-sighted as to build something like this, assuming that because it works on Earth, that it would have the same effect in a micro-gravity environment. Exactly as you said: It seems counter-intuitive, but that&#39;s precisely because your/ our only frame of reference comes from living our lives in the polar opposite of weightlessness.<br><br>Now I&#39;ve been on this rant for years. A number of times, I&#39;ve contacted educators who had published these common-sense assumptions as fact, and after long and torturous debates, I&#39;ve been able to show all of them that trying to use a centrifuge to simulate gravity in a weightless environment is factually incorrect/ it does not work. To their credit, each one who responded to me also published a corrected reprint. I was able to convince them because I can prove it.<br><br>I used to provide people with both a practical experiment they can perform and a thought experiment they could consider. However, this was sometimes more harm than help, as some people would ignore the practical experiment and just do the thought experiment. Once again, this goes back to what you said about weightlessness being counter-intuitive, because our entire experience is one where &#39;everything&#39; is not weightless. Also, the examples of experiments I used to provide have changed over the years to try to find the one experiment that will best illustrate the results and will do so indisputably (also, the easier the experiment it to perform, the more likely someone is to actually do it). <br><br>To perform this experiment, find a carnival that has one of those spinning rooms they use as a centrifuge ride. Buy a helium balloon and a string. Now the next part is kinda fiddly, but any able-bodied person should have no trouble doing it. What you want to do, is to tie a counter-weight to the balloon, using the string (though you could tie wire to the balloon instead, and the weight of the wire could act as the counter balance, without needing to attach anything more). It&#39;s important the the lift of the balloon and the weight of the counter-weight is very closely balanced. You want the balloon to hover, without rising and without falling. For the final step, take the balloon into the ride, release it and watch what happens. <br><br>Now it&#39;s important that when you do this, the balloon is hovering. It&#39;s also important that the balloon is not touching anything inside the room and that when the room starts spinning, that nothing will come into contact with the balloon. The reason is because that balloon represents you as an astronaut, floating (technically free-falling) in space, with the room/ spaceship segment/ spaceship/ space station getting ready to start spinning around you to &quot;simulate gravity&quot;. <br><br>If you perform this experiment, you will notice that the balloon continues to remain &#39;weightless&#39; wherever it was placed, while the room proceeds to spin around it. And it doesn&#39;t matter how fast or how slowly the room is spinning, that helium balloon will continue to float imperiously through the air, oblivious to the failed attempt to &#39;simulate gravity&#39; around it. I also have a potential solution for how one could actually simulate gravity in space, but I won&#39;t bother to go into more detail, unless you&#39;re actually interested in it.<br><br>Lastly, I can also give you a reasonably detailed explanation of the forces at work and why a centrifuge room/ segment doesn&#39;t work to simulate gravity in a weightless environment, but it looks like you have a reasonable grounding in physics. Perform the experiment (maybe $5- for a carnival ticket and another $2- for a few helium balloons) and it will be <del>dare I say it</del> intuitive to you what&#39;s going on.<br><br>Peace<br><br>Raz", "comment_date": "2017-05-28T15:27:33Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Warren Thomas", "comment_text": "how did they film the plane on the outside", "comment_date": "2017-05-28T12:38:42Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Maxcrypto", "comment_text": "I wonder how much does this cost", "comment_date": "2017-05-28T11:23:03Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Oliver Halder", "comment_text": "There&#39;s no such thing as gravity. <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23flatard\">#flatard</a>", "comment_date": "2017-05-28T11:01:49Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Takashi Hun", "comment_text": "I hear people said there no such thing as zero-gravity everything must have gravity", "comment_date": "2017-05-28T05:03:18Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Aday Muhajier", "comment_text": "The goal is to kiss your girlfriend in zero-g.

The aircraft flies a parabola, the velocity vector being tangent with the trajectory at each point, hence the velocity vector is constantly being rotated. The inertia of any object with mass opposes this change in the velocity vector orientation and is perceived by observers on the plane as a centrifugal force. If the centrifugal force is exactly one G, you feel weightless. The pilots control this G-factor with their flight controls. The most effective way is by pulling or pushing on the control yoke to tighten or loosen the curvature of the parabola, since throttling the engines takes too long to affect the aircraft&#39;s speed. So the true reason for zero G is the change of the orientation of the velocity vector of the aircraft that creates a mass inertia response. Not, as you exemplify using the bottle, the change in velocity vector magnitude as the aircraft accelerates towards the ground at 9.81 m/s^2. There is a change in velocity, but not that much or that quickly. The weightlessness occurs at the top part of the parabola, symmetrically before and after the apex. Not only on the downward leg after the apex.<br><br>I hope my input was helpful. I like your videos and enjoy having my intellect stimulated.
