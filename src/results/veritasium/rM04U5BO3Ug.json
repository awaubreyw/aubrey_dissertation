That was DEFINITELY NOT CO2 at the end. <br><br>Instead it was from the solid nitrogen they made. My reasoning is as follows:<br><br>1. Dry ice (AKA frozen carbon dioxide) sinks. It does not float on water. If you are uncertain about this I&#39;m sure there are probably heaps of YouTube videos showing it. [Frankly, this is all you need to know that wasn&#39;t dry ice]<br><br>2. Liquid carbon dioxide only occurs under containment, if it is open to the atmosphere it will instantly become gaseous, you would never just watch it bubble away<br><br>3. Dry ice in contact with cooled water would not sublimate into gas that fast, but when you watch the floating piece of [nitrogen] ice the gas is shooting off it<br><br>4. Carbon dioxide is heavier than air so the gas will &#39;pool&#39; more than what you see in the video. instead the gas is shooting up and away more easily, it still is somewhat heavier than air but that is because the nitrogen is still so cold<br><br>5. Carbon dioxide makes up only around 400 parts per million in air. There&#39;s no way that enough carbon dioxide from the air came into contact with the water / liquid nitrogen bath to make a big lump like that. Especially when nitrogen gas is pouring outwardly from the bath and pushing away the air<br><br>What we saw was due to the solid piece of nitrogen that was clearly floating in the liquid nitrogen before it got poured into the water bath. <br>The warmth from the water half melted it but, as it bubbled away, it cooled more and more [just like the &#39;boiling resulting in cooling&#39; explanation at the start of the video] until it became solid again [albeit now a much smaller piece]", "comment_date": "2016-06-15T08:37:36Z", "likes_count": 13}, {"comment_by": "Kkunal Bhardwaj", "comment_text": "why water didn&#39;t convert in to ice if you pour liquid + Solid nitrogen on water ?", "comment_date": "2016-06-13T17:33:14Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "JTR", "comment_text": "You should&#39;ve brought a translator to avoid an awkward &quot;conversation&quot; with a dumb scientist who took the time to learn physics but couldn&#39;t learn English", "comment_date": "2016-06-03T10:05:39Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Erik Carter", "comment_text": "maaan I wish school was like this", "comment_date": "2016-06-03T06:58:17Z", "likes_count": 5}, {"comment_by": "ElGatoLoco698", "comment_text": "So if I was thirsty and wanted a cold glass of water I could simply suck all the air out of the container, let it boil and have cold water to drink?", "comment_date": "2016-06-03T05:00:50Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Thiago Leo Kim", "comment_text": "Really love the genuine excitement of that french scientist (doctor/professor?)", "comment_date": "2016-05-31T01:09:10Z", "likes_count": 423}, {"comment_by": "Sebastian da silva", "comment_text": "i love how passionate whoever demonstrated this was about it all. how much he appreciated the really beautiful dry ice phenomenon. :)", "comment_date": "2016-05-29T16:54:43Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Joseph", "comment_text": "under enough pressure nitrogen becomes a metalloid and has semiconducting properties", "comment_date": "2016-05-28T22:33:24Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Oshanda Fernando", "comment_text": "What will happen if you touch solid Nitrogen", "comment_date": "2016-05-18T16:06:16Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Alan", "comment_text": "<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rM04U5BO3Ug&amp;t=2m50s\">2:50</a>, is basically my mom cooking.", "comment_date": "2016-05-16T13:14:27Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "ldog2010", "comment_text": "i speak spanish...so i could kind of understand the french", "comment_date": "2016-05-16T04:00:46Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Conbonbot", "comment_text": "This video totally sucks", "comment_date": "2016-05-15T04:32:56Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "petacreepers23", "comment_text": "I can cool the water by boiling it, nice!", "comment_date": "2016-05-13T09:05:18Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Forefather Of Mankind", "comment_text": "So you can explain the surface of Neptune with the help of this experiment ......
