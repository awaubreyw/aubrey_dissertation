The liquid should be a form of solid until plasma heats it some and sound waves will finish the job as the liquid also will be under high pressure with a electric magnet field with a plasma field holds it as x-rays and microwaves hit the mass that could be formed from the liquid heavys and so as the the x-rays and microwaves hit the mass the sound frequency can be made as the laser beam from the x-ray laser are focusing on it with microwaves adding a plasma field that is a control of it&#39;s mass size and frequency size .... maybe like how the radio of a old coil turns the channels ....

At 1 cm thick I would like to bet a sheet of plywood would be just as effective against a gas powered flamethrower, at least in the short term. What we did not see is the awesome power of that iron oxide and aero-gel infused fibreglass sheet! Why not take it to a forge and show how thousands of degrees of radiation along with burning sparks or even molten metal can be stopped by something that looks like a woolly blanket?<br><br><br>We saw that 150 degrees Celsius is above the boiling point of water, but alas its not hot enough to produce the leidenfrost effect; thus when looking at the 1mm thick sheet of course you are able to touch it. What would have been epic would have been to be in a glass blowing workshop. perhaps to use an aero-gell glove to show how much more dexterity you can get with a thinner glove which still has the same properties as the older thicker PPE.<br><br>To conclude we saw that when not reading or following the product instructions you can break a really awesome not a flamethrower.

Absortivity and Emissivity are also important (It&#39;s what the thermal camera turns into Temperature), much like convective index, but we&#39;ll only be talking about the material itself, not what happens on the boundary. There&#39;s also Thermal diffusivity, which is how heat distributes itself in the material from a gradient of temperature, but let&#39;s keep it basic.<br><br>What happens in the macro scale is that the aerogel has a very low thermal conductivity and what seems to be an also very low thermal capacity. The low conductivity DELAYS the increase in temperature in one side and the low thermal capacity is what allows that side to retain little thermal energy when touched. So that&#39;s why Derek can touch a 100C+ surface withouth burning himself. His body is much more conductive than the aerogel, so what happens is that when he touches the plate, his body quickly conducts away the little thermal energy in the aerogel face, effectively cooling it down. The low thermal conductivity of the Aerogel ensures that little heat is transfered through it.<br>Derek is effectivelly acting as a heat sink.", "comment_date": "2019-08-31T17:44:21Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Daniel Bieman", "comment_text": "bruh, put some aerogel in lava.", "comment_date": "2019-08-31T17:43:41Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Martin S", "comment_text": "It looks so much like a scam...
