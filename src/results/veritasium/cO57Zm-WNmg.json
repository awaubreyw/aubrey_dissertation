You kept saying the half-life is the time it takes for an element to decay and stop emitting radiation.   However the decay chain has many half-lives before an element becomes stable.  This is very misleading as some daughters emit much different radiation from their mothers and can become more dangerous in terms of exposure.

I hate it when some TV shows or documentaries are not legally available where I live. And even if, then they air with a huge delay and with dubbing which kills it. Especially when I have seen something in original English and then see it later dubbed. And it does not matter if it is\u00a0dubbed to German/Czech/Slovak.
