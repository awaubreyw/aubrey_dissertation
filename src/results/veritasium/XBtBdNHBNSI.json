Theres very little difference in efficiency between a competently executed straddle and an equivalent flop.

To me a good high jumper seems to  need the same conditions as a power engineer who goes to achieve only one harmonic from an electric generator and that is all the  energy must be restricted to the fundamental waveform and not the harmonics. In fact when athletes and dancers, including ballet dancers perform their bit, one can immediately see if the performer is wasting energy in adding unnecessary motions.  Even in horse racing, one can detect a good racing horse  through noting that the horse&#39;s movement does not contain any unnecessary &quot; harmonic&quot; except the very fundamental motion, as  energy will be wasted.  There are  many clumsy people who produce unnecessary motions in their manner of walking and running, and the graceful movements seems to win all the time.
